That describes the first stages of the long race before India's general election, which will end only in early March. 
Opinion polls suggest that, unless things change, the Hindu-nationalist BJP and its allies will emerge as the largest combination by far, though short of an absolute majority. The most comprehensive poll, in the magazine India Today, suggests that the BJP will win 234 to 249 out of Parliament's 543 seats, up from the party's 94 seats in the mid-1996 election; the Congress party and its allies will get 150 to 165 seats, up from 139; and the 13-member United Front, which has ruled for the past 18 months, will get just 120 to 135 seats, down from 179. 
The BJP is on a roll. Dav after day, defectors from other parties (mostly Congress) join its ranks. Congress was shaken when two of its top leaders in the states of Madhya Pradesh and Maharashtra crossed sides. In addition, the BJP has managed to line up several new allies. The party, though strong in the north and west, has failed to make headway in the south and east. But in the past two weeks it has negotiated a string of alliances with regional parties which could help put it in power for the first time. 
If, as predicted, the sJP-led alliance ends up with 240 seats or so, it would be strongly placed to attract 35 defectors from Congress and the United Front and thus put together a majority. On the other hand, the rise of the BJP might help to push the parties of the United Front and Congress closer together, and between them they could have a majority. Much may change. 
Initial gloom in the Congress camp has given way to euphoria after Sonia, widow of Rajiv Gandhi, a former prime minister, announced this week that she would join the campaign. Congress, the party that spearheaded India's independence, was converted by Indira Gandhi into a family vehicle for the Gandhi clan. The assassination of Indira and Rajiv has left the party without a Gandhi in charge, and it feels abandoned. Morale has surged with Mrs Gandhi's announcement. Party members consider her a messiah, and doubters are regarded as traitors. Whether voters will be similarly enthused is not so clear. 
However, even a lamp-post would attract more enthusiasm than the current party chief, Sitaram Kesri. He is a shrewd manipulator behind the scenes, but has no mass appeal. If Mrs Gandhi's campaigning is limited to a few election speeches supporting Mr Kesri, she will not make much impact. If, however, she decides to take over the party leadership and appoint a new team, she could conceivably generate a wave of support. The India Today poll puts her as voters' second choice for the prime minister's job, after the BJP's Atal Behari Vajpayee. Voters want a change from what they see as the old bunch of corrupt rascals. 
Yet if Mrs Gandhi enters the fray, the BJP will gleefully denounce her as pro-rascal. As a nationalist party, it will sneer at her Italian ancestry. More important, the party will remind voters that her husband Rajiv lost the 1989 election after allegations of kickbacks in a deal to buy howitzers from Bofors, a Swedish arms company. The Swiss government is, in stages, handing over papers relating to payments made by Bofors into various Swiss bank accounts after the howitzer deal, and the BJP will turn that into a big election issue. Already BJP politicians are putting it about that Mrs Gandhi has entered politics to try to censor the Swiss bank papers relating to her husband.

Confirmation follows from the trailer-loads of villagers coming to attend Sonia Gandhi's election meeting. Many are jats, the local land-owning caste. One says, ""We have come to see Sonia. But we will vote for whomever Ajit tells us to."" Ajit Singh is the local leader of the jats, whose regional party has teamed with the Congress party backed by Mrs Gandhi. She has glamour, but Mr Singh commands tribal loyalty, and that matters more. 
Less vocal but no less determined is the mood among dalits (formerly called untouchables), who have their own party, the Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP). Its leader, Kanshi Ram, is standing in the neighbouring constituency of Saharanpur. ""In the old days, the upper castes would not even let us vote,"" he says. ""Only if you have political power can you change society."" Dalit voters are emphatic that they could stand up for their rights only when their party was briefly in power in the state. Would it not have been wiser for their party to ally itself with one of the larger parties instead of going it alone? No, says a young dalit. ""The other parties only use us."" 
Muslims constitute almost a quarter of the electorate in this region. ""We will all vote for the Samajwadi Party,"" says Sabir Ali Khan, a furniture dealer. While in power, the Samajwadi Party resisted attempts by Hindu fanatics to destroy a disputed mosque at Ayodhya, and that has earned it deep gratitude from Muslims. Traditionally, this community supported Congress, but no more. It does not bother them that the Samajwadi Party has a reputation for fielding mafia dons. 
Upper-caste voters are gung-ho for the Bharatiya Janata Party (BjP), a Hindu nationalist party that aided the demolition of the Ayodhya mosque. The party swept the region in 1996 and hopes to do so again. Why are villagers so keen on the sJP? Many shrug their shoulders: ""The whole caste has decided on it,"" says one. Tribal loyalty transcends political analysis. 
Opinion polls have predicted the BJP will win the most votes, although no party is expected to win an outright majority. This means India is likely to face another period of coalition politics. Yet the BJP may gain from another political battle in Uttar Pradesh. Just before polling began, the state governor sacked the chief minister, Kalyan Singh, a Hindu nationalist. The BJP was so outraged that its nominee for prime minister, Atal Behari Vajpayee, went on a hunger strike. He gave up when a court restored Mr Singh to power. This fight, however, is probably far from over. 
Caste and politics often infringe on daily life. ""If the local police chief or subdivisional magistrate is a Muslim or Brahmin, everybody from these communities knows they can do anything they like and get away with it,"" says a local civil servant. When impartial governance gives way to communal bias, issues cease to matter and become a cloak for the politics of patronage. None of the villagers had heard of economic liberalisation, so debates on reform in distant Delhi are of no consequence.

ANOTHER poll, another coalition, another set of rogues and incompetents to misgovern India. It is hard not to be cynical about the latest election in the world's biggest democracy. It has produced no outright winner, settled no single issue, and promises neither communal harmony nor governmental stability. Yet only rarely do elections anywhere provide definitive answers. India's this year was never likely to be one of those. At least, amid the heat and dust, some shapes can now be better discerned. They are not all ugly. 
One is the shape of the Bharatiya Janata Party. The BJP was the winner ofthis election, though even with its pre-poll allies it did not secure enough seats to give it an outright majority in the lower house of Parliament (see page 41). That should be a relief to everyone who believes in the secular values on which India is based. The Bjp is a Hindu-nationalist party, unashamedly hostile to the country's 120m Muslims and to other minorities. It surged to prominence in the late 198os by campaigning to build a temple at Ayodhya, on the site of a 400-year-old mosque that desecrated, it said, the birthplace of the Hindu god, Lord Ram. Zealots duly destroyed the mosque in 1992, setting off a round of slaughter in which thousands of people, mostly Muslims, died. 
The BJP is undeniably ugly, yet less so than it was. It still wants a temple built at Ayodhya, and it still preaches swadeshi (economic nationalism). But its appeal, at least to educated Indians, probably lies less in its chauvinism than in its claim, a reasonable one, to be less predatory and corrupt than Congress, the party that has governed India for 45 of the past 50 years. Moreover, the BJP now seems to believe that extremism does not win votes. With the relatively liberal A.B. Vajpayee as its would-be prime minister, it seeks to project a more moderate image, pointing to its half-dozen Muslim candidates and to the comparatively benign Hindu-Muslim relations to be found in the states where it holds power. In office, a BJP government would certainly seek to promote Indian industry-and to keep out culturally dubious fried chicken and hamburgers from abroad-but the party has tempered its opposition to foreign investment, at least in the important parts of the economy such as infrastructure. 
More worrying is the prospect of India pressing ahead with the development of its nuclear-weapons programme. This could prove to be the one pledge in its manifesto that the BJP would honour without compromise, partly because it believes that by openly going nuclear India would become an unignorable player on the world stage, partly because the policy would arouse little opposition at home. It would, however, arouse considerable opposition abroad. China would be sharply disapproving. America would also be stem, invoking sanctions if a nuclear device were tested and thus stop ping the flow of American aid and perhaps even aid from the World Bank and the IMF. Pakistan would go ballistic, literally. For a country that should be looking for friends, not enemies, in a world increasingly characterised by regional clubs and groupings, it is hard to think of a more foolish policy. 
It is far from certain, however, that the BJP will attain power, or manage to hang on to it, even in coalition. The alternative would be a government of Congress and a collection of smaller parties. The shape of such an outfit would be a ragbag, bulging with ill-assorted lumps, trailing loose ends and ever in danger of falling apart. Would it be manipulated by Sonia Gandhi, the widow of Rajiv, the former prime minister murdered in 1991? Her decision to campaign in this election, and to do so with her children conspicuously at hand, undoubtedly gave a lift to party morale. But its effect on the voters was more ambiguous, leaving unanswered the question of whether India really wants to continue with dynastic politics. 
Dynasties don't breed dynamism 
If it does, the outlook is bleak. Mrs Gandhi may have a magic name, but she has no magic ideas and few practical ones either. Congress is the party that allowed India, despite the manifest talents and enterprise of its people, to languish for so long in economic backwardness. Under the Gandhis, Congress became a party of thieves and sycophants, though in a brief moment of national economic desperation after 1991 it started to liberalise the economy. Many in the party blamed the post-1991 reforms for its defeat in the 1966 election. Fortunately, Congress now seems less hostile to economic reform, though few realise how badly and how fast it is needed. 
The evidence for this is the way Congress's candidates, and indeed their rivals, treated the issue of East Asia's economic turmoil in the campaign. For most of those who mentioned it at all-few did-their neighbours' troubles showed only the wisdom of an unconvertible currency and, with greater reason, of denominating debts in rupees, not dollars: no need for India to change Yet before long the humbled East Asians will be back in business with leaner companies and cheaper currencies, grabbing investment that might otherwise go to India and invading export markets that India might otherwise exploit. Meanwhile, the Indians, no matter who holds power in Delhi, will be only slowly unwinding the web of rules and permits with which they are still trussed. 
In recent years, Indian politics has been breaking up, as Congress's decline has enabled smaller parties based on caste, region and religion to spring up. This has not been all bad. The country has not, despite fears, fallen apart; new ideas have started to bubble up in states like Andhra Pradesh. But in the election few of these new parties' leaders said, ""Vote for me, I'll bring you faster growth."" Most said, ""Vote for me, I'll give you more subsidies,"" just like India's other politicians. Many smaller parties were losers this time, though allies of the BJP and Congress made gains; regional incumbents were widely rebuked. Yet competition among the states remains the best hope for promoting change. When the shape of that change begins to emerge, Indians may claim that their treasured democracy is at last beginning to work for them. It is not happening yet.

IT IS a hung parliament. It will now be drawn and quartered, say the cynics. Two disparate combines of over 15 parties, one led by the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and the other by the Congress party, are trying to buy or cajole enough MPS to get to the magic figure of 272 seats needed for an absolute majority in the lower house of the Indian Parliament. 
The BJP-led combine has won 251 seats, the Congress-led group 168 and the United Front 95, with independents and minor parties accounting for 21. If Congress and the United Front can get together, they may have the strongest claim. But some regional parties in the United Front, notably the Telegu Desam Party, with 12 seats, regard Congress as their principal foe in state elections. That gives the BJP an edge. 
Elections to 534 seats have taken place so far, and a poll in Jammu & Kashmir will be held on March 7th. Opinion polls suggest the United Front may win four seats there and the BJP one. Only after these results are in is the president likely to swear in the next government. That leaves plenty of time for horse-trading in Delhi. It is perhaps symbolic that the prime minister's residence is in Race Course Road. 
Regardless of which side is given the first chance to have a go, the next government will be liable to be pulled down by minor groups with no more than two or three votes. The outgoing United Front govemment, which ruled for the past 18 months, was thought to be unstable, but only one party (Congress) had the numbers to bring it down. This time, any one of five or six groups may have enough MPS to topple the government So the next ruler will be hostage to demands from a multitude of opportunistic and venal partners. 
Caste and stars 
The election was billed as a clash of two titans, Sonia Gandhi of Congress and Atal Behari Vajpayee of the BJP. Both drew huge audiences. Yet Congress failed to improve on its 1996 tally of 141 seats, and even lost in Rajiv Gandhi's old stronghold. The BJP improved its score by a modest 15 seats to 176. In contrast, Congress's allies gained 25 seats and the BjP's allies 40. It was a classic case of the supporting cast (which often meant supporting caste) outshining the big stars. The only real victor was regionalism. 
Either coalition will have to trim its policies to keep its partners happy. If it comes to power, the BJP will not be able to implement its most controversial pro-Hindu policies. These include the building of a temple on the ruins ofthe mosque demolished in Ayodhya in 1992, abolishing Kashmir's special autonomy, and replacing the personal law of Muslims and other minorities with a common civil code. Most of the BjP's partners have wooed Muslims in the past and will be reluctant permanently to alienate these voters. 
In general, the regional parties are investor-friendly. Under the old command system of socialism, Delhi decided who could invest how much and where. But the deregulation of the 1990s has created competition between the states in attracting investment from within India as well as from foreign businessmen. Having tasted economic power, the regional parties will not surrender it. 
The BJP has a lunatic fringe wanting to throw out all foreign multinationals, leave the World Trade Organisation, and raise the exchange rate from the current 39.5 rupees to the dollar to 17. But the party mainstream is more moderate, and says it simply wants to give Indian business a fair chance to compete with the more resourceful multinationals. It says no foreign investor already operating in India would be asked to leave. But it fears Indian culture may be eroded by foreign investment in food and drinks, and so would be likely to curtail future investment in booze, soft drinks, potato crisps, pizza parlours and the like. Ironically, this might be of most help not to Indian businessmen but to those foreign investors already entrenched. 
The BJP might also curb foreign portfolio investment, which it regards as volatile hot money. However, the party is aware of the need to maintain foreign confidence, and wishes to avoid emulating Malaysia's outspoken Mahathir Mohamad: it wants to champion Indian business without scaring away foreigners. It welcomes foreign investment in infrastructure, which alone could soak up $10 billion a year. 
The party wants India to deploy nuclear weapons. It hopes that, as long as it does not conduct a fresh nuclear test, it will not be subject to international sanctions. However, the BJP would need the support of almost 100 other MPS to survive, and it is not clear whether its coalition partners would want to take the risk of bringing down a torrent of international wrath. Many regional parties have little interest in international or even national matters. 
One way or another, Indian politics at the moment looks a mess. Jeremiahs are already predicting another election next year. ","India faces unstable government whichever party takes power

Yet Congress failed to improve on its 1996 tally of 141 seats, and even lost in Rajiv Gandhi's old stronghold. The BJP improved its score by a modest 15 seats to 176. In contrast, Congress's allies gained 25 seats and the BjP's allies 40. It was a classic case of the supporting cast (which often meant supporting caste) outshining the big stars. The only real victor was regionalism. 
Either coalition will have to trim its policies to keep its partners happy. If it comes to power, the BJP will not be able to implement its most controversial pro-Hindu policies. These include the building of a temple on the ruins ofthe mosque demolished in Ayodhya in 1992, abolishing Kashmir's special autonomy, and replacing the personal law of Muslims and other minorities with a common civil code. Most of the BjP's partners have wooed Muslims in the past and will be reluctant permanently to alienate these voters. 
In general, the regional parties are investor-friendly. Under the old command system of socialism, Delhi decided who could invest how much and where. But the deregulation of the 1990s has created competition between the states in attracting investment from within India as well as from foreign businessmen. Having tasted economic power, the regional parties will not surrender it. 
The BJP has a lunatic fringe wanting to throw out all foreign multinationals, leave the World Trade Organisation, and raise the exchange rate from the current 39.5 rupees to the dollar to 17. But the party mainstream is more moderate, and says it simply wants to give Indian business a fair chance to compete with the more resourceful multinationals. It says no foreign investor already operating in India would be asked to leave. But it fears Indian culture may be eroded by foreign investment in food and drinks, and so would be likely to curtail future investment in booze, soft drinks, potato crisps, pizza parlours and the like. Ironically, this might be of most help not to Indian businessmen but to those foreign investors already entrenched. 
The BJP might also curb foreign portfolio investment, which it regards as volatile hot money. However, the party is aware of the need to maintain foreign confidence, and wishes to avoid emulating Malaysia's outspoken Mahathir Mohamad: it wants to champion Indian business without scaring away foreigners. It welcomes foreign investment in infrastructure, which alone could soak up $10 billion a year. 
The party wants India to deploy nuclear weapons. It hopes that, as long as it does not conduct a fresh nuclear test, it will not be subject to international sanctions. However, the BJP would need the support of almost 100 other MPS to survive, and it is not clear whether its coalition partners would want to take the risk of bringing down a torrent of international wrath. Many regional parties have little interest in international or even national matters.

TO SAY the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) has come to power would be an exaggeration; hobbled to power would be more accurate. It won 179 of the 539 seats contested in the February general election (four more constituencies will go to the polls by June). Even after getting the support of Zo small parties and independents, the BJP has only 264 votes in Parliament, still short of a majority. However, the Telegu Desam Party (TDP), part of the United Front, has said it will abstain in a vote of confidence, in which case the BJP-led combine will have a majority of one. On this slim expectation, Atal Behari Vajpayee was sworn in as prime minister on March 19th, and will face a vote of confidence by March 28th. Even if he wins, his majority may disappear when the four remaining seats are filled. 
Mr Vajpayee is as worried about foes within his combine as without. The parties he relies on have different ideologies, and have come together only for convnience. One such party, the AIADMK of Tamil Nadu, with 18 seats, suddenly withdrew its sup port for the BJP last week, claiming that Mr Vajpayee was not paying enough attention to its regional demands. The real reason was that the party wanted the finance post, and the BJP could not possibly give this up. A dejected Mr Vajpayee confessed he could not put together a majority. But within two days the AIADMK returned to the 
BJP fold, smouldering with resentment but unwilling to pull the rug away right now. Pessimists say this shows the new government will constantly be blackmailed by its partners. Optimists say it shows you can stand up to blackmail and survive. How often remains an open question. 
The combine has cobbled together a ""national agenda"" from the manifestos of its members. This avoids detail and reads largely like a charter for motherhood. It excludes anti-Muslim parts of the BJP manifesto-legislating to build a Hindu temple on the ruins of a mosque demolished by BJP supporters in 1992, replacing Muslim personal law by a civil code, and abolishing the special status of Kashmir, India's only Muslim-majority state. 
Although the BJP has a militant Hindu core, it has added several liberal layers in its search for wider support. Mr Vajpayee represents its liberal face. Its liberal mask, say critics: Hindu militants are using him to make the BJP look respectable, but once the party gets an absolute majority it will cast him aside and bare its fangs. Optimists, however, argue that the BJP's search for power will force it to accommodate the views of so many new groups that the party will change character. The national agenda promises a riot-free India, implying that the BJP will avoid fomenting Hindu-Muslim riots (which it has done in the past). Mr Vajpayee has called for a new political era of ""reconciliation and accord"" in which national consensus replaces the old adversarial politics. Grand words, no doubt. But this sounds more like a desperate plea for survival than a search for high moral ground. 
On one major issue Mr Vajpayee has not waited for a consensus. The national agenda declares the government will ""induct"" nuclear weapons. If India goes openly nuclear, so will Pakistan. Both countries have nuclear capability but have refrained so far from assembling and deploying nuclear weapons. Foreign diplomats still hope that the BJP can be persuaded to settle for something short of deployment. Still, it is notable that the smaller parties in the combine are willing to go along with BJP assertiveness on this score. That marks a shift in the centre of political gravity. 
The national agenda says economic liberalisation and globalisation will continue, but be ""calibrated"" to ensure that Indian industry is strengthened in the process. This is deliberately vague. Many hardliners in the BJP want to restrict foreign investment in consumer goods, and increase protection for Indian businessmen (especially now that they face a flood of cheap imports from crisis-hit countries in East Asia). 
The Congress party is watching the BJP's travails with grim amusement, and hopes to cash in on them. Sonia Gandhi (see box on next page), who became party president last week, was on March i6th also elected to the chair of the Congress parliamentary party, even though she is not a member of either house of Parliament. This is a clear signal that she herself seeks to head the next Congress-led government. 
Congress government will need the support of the 95-member United Front to survive. This has been made more feasible by Mrs Gandhi's ousting of Sitaram Kesri as Congress chief Mr Kesri had toppled two successive prime ministers belonging to the Janata Dal, a member of the United Front. Naturally, the Janata Dal wanted revenge on Mr Kesri. Now that Mrs Gandhi has obliged, its resistance to Congress has diminished greatly. 
The election virtually halved the strength of the United Front and it has been depleted further by the decision of the TDP, one of its constituents from the state of Andhra Pradesh, to abstain on a vote of confidence. This abstention is crucial for keeping the BjP in power, so the United Front has threatened to expel the TDP. That may simply drive the party into the waiting arms of the BJP. A lesson of the general election is that, in India's fractured polity, big parties cannot afford to throw their weight around but small parties can. That does not augur well for stability.

RELIGIOUS fundamentalists. Hindu brown-shirts on the road to fascism. Nuclear maniacs. Autarkic economic dinosaurs. These are a few of the epithets flung by critics at the Bharatiya Janata Party (Bjp,X which heads the i9-party coalition that narrowly survived a vote of confidence in India's lower house of Parliament on March 28th. The BJP's first bid to govern, in 1996, collapsed after just 13 days. Even though it depends for support on shaky alliances with so many other parties, the BJP now has a chance to run the world's biggest democracy, at least for a while. Despite the brickbats, that is not necessarily such a frightening prospect. 
The BJP certainly has some creepycrawlies in its ranks, especially in its cultural wing, the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS). Nevertheless, the party is a moderniser, not an atavistic throwback. Besides, the search for political power in a democracy often has a way of taming extremism, and coalition politics should do so even more. The BJP-led coalition may well end up behaving much like its recent predecessors. 
Four-fifths of all Indians are Hindus, and the BJP espouses Hindu nationalism. It seeks the restoration of Hindu pride and glory in politics and business, after eight centuries of Muslim conquest and 200 years of British colonial rule. This makes the party communal, xenophobic and abrasive. Other political parties in India want to accommodate diversity in a country that is multi-lingual, multi-religious and multi-ethnic. But the BJP wants ""one nation, one people and one culture"". It says this composite culture, Hindutva, encompasses all religions, regions and languages in India. In effect, it wants other communities to become ingredients in a Hindu alloy. The Bjp's methods of persuasion, however, sometimes seem brutal, and have included fomenting riots in which thousands of people have been killed. 
The slr traces its origins to 1925, when the Rss began as a self-defence force to protect Hindus in riots. The Rss's founder, Keshav Hedgewar, believed Hindus had been conquered repeatedly because they were weakened by internal dissension. He sought a modern, united Hindu society free of caste and regional divides. 
The Rss took part in India's independence movement, which was spearheaded by the Congress party under Mahatma Gandhi. But it was unhappy with Gandhi's policy of non-violence, which it felt reflected a Christian rather than a Hindu ethos. Hedgewar observed that all Hindu gods bore arms, and he flirted with the terrorist fringe. But most of his time was devoted to developing the Rss as a social and cultural institution that would withstand Muslim communalism. 
The group organised shahas, morning meetings which young people would attend in uniform (khaki shirts and shorts with a black cap) to drill, play Indian games, and be indoctrinated in Hindutva. It ran schools (where the textbooks demonised Muslim rulers) and engaged in rural development and disaster relief(Rss volunteers are often the first to arrive at places hit by floods or cyclones). Later it helped create a large trade union and a students' organisation, both of which increased its organisational clout. 
Independence in 1947 was accompanied by the partition of the subcontinent into India and Pakistan. In the Hindu-Muslim riots that followed, hundreds of thousands died and tom had to move home. Gandhi called for peace, but the Rss sought retribution. Gandhi was murdered for being too soft on Muslims by a Hindu fanatic who had once been in the Rss. The government banned the RSS and arrested 17,ooo of its members. This persuaded the Rss that it needed the support of a political party, so it helped create a Hindu-nationalist one, the Jan Sangh. 
The Jan Sangh won only a handful of seats in successive elections from 1952 to 1971. In 1975, Indira Gandhi, then prime minister and leader of the Congress party, declared a state of emergency and threw her political opponents into jail. In the process she united them. In the 1977 election, the Jan Sangh and other opposition parties merged to form the Janata Party, which routed Mrs Gandhi. However, bickering led to the break-up of the Janata Party after only two years. Regrouping, old Jan Sangh members decided against reviving their party and instead formed the Bharatiya Janata Party, seeking new support by proclaiming ""Gandhian socialism"". Voters found the change implausible: the BJP won only two seats in Parliament in the 1984 election. So a different appeal was required. This was provided by another event then coming to the boil. 
Four centuries ago, the Mughal Emperor Babar had conquered Ayodhya, the legendary birthplace of the Hindu god Ram, and built a mosque there. In the 198os the Vishwa Hindu Parishad (v""-iP), an affiliate of the BJP, claimed (without evidence) that the site of the mosque was the precise birthplace of Ram, so a Hindu temple must be built there. Thanks to the vr-m's success in raising Hindu passions, the BJP won 88 seats in the 1989 election and 120 in 1991. 
In 1992 a Hindu mob destroyed the mosque in what was seen as symbolic revenge for eight centuries of Muslim conquest. Babar had finally been vanquished and the BJP was on its way. The Ayodhya incident helped it win 160 seats in the 1996 election. That, however, was still well short ofthe 272 then needed for a majority in Parliament, and the party also barely existed outside northern and western India. Moreover, the vHP was unable to mobilise popular Hindu support for an attempt to demolish 3,ooo other mosques believed to have been built on the ruins of temples. 
To attain power, the BjP had to reach a much wider range of voters. In this February's election it wooed regional parties and liberal Hindus. This meant toning down its more extreme language. It also began wooing Muslims. In states where it came to power it portrayed itself as the party of law and order, and ended rioting. Some Muslims prefer BJP-imposed security to the lawlessness that went before. Exit polls in the February election suggest that between 7% and 16% of Muslims voted for the BJP. The party fielded six Muslim candidates, and has appointed two Muslims as ministers. These gestures are aimed less at Muslims than at liberal Hindus, the bulk of the voters. (Polls say the BP fares best among the young, urbanised and highly educated.) 
Critics say the new liberalism is just a mask. Once the party is in power, Rss militants will infiltrate all organs of the state to lay the foundation of an Rss takeover. Optimists, however, think the party is changing for the better. At first, it attracted only a narrow section of north Indian, upper-caste voters. But already, in its desire to widen its base, it has been obliged to try to appeal to the lower castes, people outside north India, and more secular-minded voters. However opportunistic, this has set in motion a process that is changing the character of the party. It may even end up as a sort of Hindu counterpart to western Christian-democratic parties. For the more immediate future, however, the BJP has to face questions created by its past 
Is it fundamentalist? 
The BJP has been accused of religious fundamentalism. Were the charge fair, it would be reassuring, since ancient Hinduism was tolerant in its own way (see box). But the BJP has no desire to go back to ancient Hinduism. Many of its leaders belong to the Arya Samaj sect that eschews idol worship and castigates traditional Hinduism. In fact, the bulk of the party's thinkers are reformers who seek a modern Hinduism purged of caste and sex discrimination. 
Why then does the slr still want to build a temple at Ayodhya, as it certainly does? So long as it keeps this commitment, it will have trouble convincing sceptics that it really is benign. They will suspect, reasonably, that the zealots are too strong in the party to let the liberals abandon the vow outright. Yet temple-building was never part of the party's original agenda. Its aim was always the grander and broader one of reviving Hindu glory. Some of its officials are now reconverting tribesmen and untouchables who had earlier embraced Islam or Christianity. Traditional Hinduism did not accept converts, but the BJP wants to regain its flock It has roughed up some Christian missionaries in the process. 
Most religious fundamentalists revel in their fundamentalism. The BJP, however, claims to be secular, and accuses other political parties of being pseudo-secular while appeasing Muslim communalism. It wants a common civil code for all Indians in place of the existing Muslim and Christian personal law. It wants to abolish the constitutional autonomy of India's only Muslim-majority state, Kashmir. And it wants to replace India's Minorities Commission with an unspecific humanrights body (pointing out that the rights of Hindus, as well as of minorities, get trampled on too) These, it says, are secular demands. 
Is it fascist? 
The sight of RSS cadres drilling in khaki shirts and shorts evokes uneasy memories of Hitler's brownshirts. Party officials are trained in the use of the staff, a traditional Indian weapon. The Rss says the Hindu spiritual tradition always included the akhara, or gymnasium. 
Much Rss literature is contemptuous of democracy. Tracts in the 193os admired Hitler, asserted the superiority of the Hindu race, and denounced opponents as traitors. Critics say the Rss agenda of building a Hindu nation cannot be achieved by democratic means, so (like Hitler) it is using democracy to seize power. 
However, the modern slr is not the old RSS. The BJP does not seek to eliminate Muslims, but it wants them to accept the basically Hindu flavour of India. It claims it wants to create a melting-pot of races and cultures, and says Hindu predominance in this mix will be no different from Christian predominance in America's oft-invoked melting-pot. 
Is it a nuclear maniac? 
India was a military superpower in the ancient world, and the RSS wants it to carry the same clout by going openly nuclear. Pakistan developed a nuclear capability in the 198os, without testing. All political parties in India want the nuclear option, but the BJP has been the most jingoistic. Yet in its latest manifesto, written in the expectation of coming to power, the BJP toned down its military declarations. And when Atal Behari Vajpayee, the new prime minister, was asked whether he would deploy nuclear weapons, he equivocated by saying, ""If it is necessary."" 
Is it a dinosaur? 
The BJP is often called right-wing. Nationalist fits better. The party has traditionally stressed self-sufFiciency. Many of its members fear foreign multinationals as incipient imperialists. It castigates the World Trade Organisation for robbing India of sovereignty. On such issues, the BjP is at one with the Indian left. 
But it opposes the web of controls brought in over the past 40 years and wants internal liberalisation. It swears by swadeshi, meaning that India must be built by Indians. Before opening up, it says, Indian business must first become strong enough to stand up to foreign competition. 
RSS militants also want to protect Indian culture, which includes eating and drinking habits. Rss mobs have attacked branches of America's Kentucky Fried Chicken and McDonald's. 
In economic policy, the BJP is more liberal than the RSS, and recognises the need for foreign investment in infrastructure and heavy industry. No foreign multinational will be asked to leave, but future foreign investment will be curbed in ""nonpriority"" areas. The likely targets are such consumer goods as foods, drinks and soap. Yet India is a small market for branded consumer goods. It is a huge one for infrastructure, so such curbs will have little effect on overall foreign investment. 
What about Enron? When the BJP came to power in 1995 in the state of Maharashtra, it cancelled a power plant being built by Enron, an American firm, which it accused of bribery. Within months, however, the state government renegotiated the project and expanded it. Outraged leftists challenged the contract in court, but the BJP coolly told the judge that its anti-Enron campaign was merely a political gimmick to win the state election. That, perhaps, is a better guide to the real nature of the BJP than the old Rss ideology. 
Today, the BJP knows its fragile coalition may not last. It wants to use its time in government to show, to Indians as well as to the rest of the world, that it is a moderate, responsible party. The new finance minister, Yashwant Sinha, says ""multinationals have nothing to fear."" His son works for McKinsey, an international consulting firm, and his daughter-in-law is a fund manager with Oppenheimer, a New Yorkbased investment bank. Thus globalisation affects even the BJP. 
Mr Sinha will raise import duties in his budget in May, to bring down the budget deficit and protect Indian firms from cheap imports from South-East Asia. But he claims, as trade-barrier-raisers usually do, that this will be a temporary measure. The BJP says it has abandoned autarky and wants to give Indian business seven to ten years to integrate fully with the world economy. 
The betting is that the BJP will cut lots of red tape to liberalise the domestic economy, prove more energetic than previous governments in privatisation, create independent regulators to reduce ministerial discretion (and corruption), and streamline rules for foreign investment in infrastructure. 
Many voters disillusioned with other parties want to give the BJP a chance. Yet state governments run by the BJP have proved not very different from any other, and in the recent election it lost ground in the states it runs. It won barely 25% of the total vote, mostly in the north and west. It forged an alliance with 14 regional parties where it was weak. The tally of the BjP-led combine increased from 192 to 252 seats. But the BJP's own score rose only from 16o to 179. 
So the party's quest for power has made it increasingly dependent on disparate allies with very different agendas. Indeed, to keep the combine together, the BJP has been obliged to put on hold the three central commitments that have made it different from other parties: legislating to build a temple at Ayodhya; scrapping Kashmir's special status; and enacting a common civil code. The very strategy that has enabled the BJP to come to power has also otr liged it to dilute its agenda. 
India's diversity could lead to permanent coalition politics. Perhaps two main groups will emerge, but there will be big disparities within each and therefore constant compromise. Anxious to expand its image beyond Muslim-baiting, the BJp has long claimed to be a party of good governance, which does not field criminals in elections or buy defectors from other parties. But in recent years it has done both, saying it cannot disadvantage itself by giving rivals a monopoly on dirty tricks. 
So the BJP starts to look like other parties, for good and bad. And while cynics say its policy dilution is tactical, some of the changes certainly appear real. Mr Vajpayee reckons that as a political party grows and seeks a wider base of voters, it has constantly to incorporate the concerns of new groups. Indeed, even the Rss is doing so. This, as Mr Vajpayee says, is evolution, not dilution. It could yet serve India well.

And it wants to replace India 's Minorities Commission with an unspecific humanrights body ( pointing out that the rights of Hindus , as well as of minorities , get trampled on too ) These , it says , are secular demands . 
 Is it fascist ? 
 The sight of RSS cadres drilling in khaki shirts and shorts evokes uneasy memories of Hitler 's brownshirts . Party officials are trained in the use of the staff , a traditional Indian weapon . The Rss says the Hindu spiritual tradition always included the akhara , or gymnasium . 
 Much Rss literature is contemptuous of democracy . Tracts in the 193os admired Hitler , asserted the superiority of the Hindu race , and denounced opponents as traitors . Critics say the Rss agenda of building a Hindu nation can not be achieved by democratic means , so ( like Hitler ) it is using democracy to seize power . 
 However , the modern slr is not the old RSS . The BJP does not seek to eliminate Muslims , but it wants them to accept the basically Hindu flavour of India . It claims it wants to create a melting - pot of races and cultures , and says Hindu predominance in this mix will be no different from Christian predominance in America 's oft - invoked melting - pot . 
 Is it a nuclear maniac ? 
 India was a military superpower in the ancient world , and the RSS wants it to carry the same clout by going openly nuclear . Pakistan developed a nuclear capability in the 198os , without testing . All political parties in India want the nuclear option , but the BJP has been the most jingoistic . Yet in its latest manifesto , written in the expectation of coming to power , the BJP toned down its military declarations . And when Atal Bihari Vajpayee was asked whether Atal Bihari Vajpayee would deploy nuclear weapons , Atal Bihari Vajpayee equivocated by saying , "" If it is necessary . "" 
 Is it a dinosaur ? 
 The BJP is often called right - wing . Nationalist fits better . The party has traditionally stressed self - sufFiciency . Many of its members fear foreign multinationals as incipient imperialists . It castigates the World Trade Organisation for robbing India of sovereignty . On such issues , the BjP is at one with the Indian left . 
 But it opposes the web of controls brought in over the past 40 years and wants internal liberalisation . It swears by swadeshi , meaning that India must be built by Indians . Before opening up , it says , Indian business must first become strong enough to stand up to foreign competition . 
 RSS militants also want to protect Indian culture , which includes eating and drinking habits . Rss mobs have attacked branches of America 's Kentucky Fried Chicken and McDonald 's . 
 In economic policy , the BJP is more liberal than the RSS , and recognises the need for foreign investment in infrastructure and heavy industry . No foreign multinational will be asked to leave , but future foreign investment will be curbed in "" nonpriority "" areas . The likely targets are such consumer goods as foods , drinks and soap . Yet India is a small market for branded consumer goods . It is a huge one for infrastructure , so such curbs will have little effect on overall foreign investment . 
 What about Enron ? When the BJP came to power in 1995 in the state of Maharashtra , it cancelled a power plant being built by Enron , an American firm , which it accused of bribery . Within months , however , the state government renegotiated the project and expanded it . Outraged leftists challenged the contract in court , but the BJP coolly told the judge that its anti - Enron campaign was merely a political gimmick to win the state election . That , perhaps , is a better guide to the real nature of the BJP than the old Rss ideology . 
 Today , the BJP knows its fragile coalition may not last . It wants to use its time in government to show , to Indians as well as to the rest of the world , that it is a moderate , responsible party . The new finance minister , Yashwant Sinha , says "" multinationals have nothing to fear . "" His son works for McKinsey , an international consulting firm , and his daughter - in - law is a fund manager with Oppenheimer , a New Yorkbased investment bank . Thus globalisation affects even the BJP . 
 Mr Sinha will raise import duties in his budget in May , to bring down the budget deficit and protect Indian firms from cheap imports from South - East Asia . But he claims , as trade - barrier - raisers usually do , that this will be a temporary measure . The BJP says it has abandoned autarky and wants to give Indian business seven to ten years to integrate fully with the world economy . 
 The betting is that the BJP will cut lots of red tape to liberalise the domestic economy , prove more energetic than previous governments in privatisation , create independent regulators to reduce ministerial discretion ( and corruption ) , and streamline rules for foreign investment in infrastructure . 
 Many voters disillusioned with other parties want to give the BJP a chance . Yet state governments run by the BJP have proved not very different from any other , and in the recent election it lost ground in the states it runs . It won barely 25 % of the total vote , mostly in the north and west . It forged an alliance with 14 regional parties where it was weak . The tally of the BjP - led combine increased from 192 to 252 seats . But the BJP 's own score rose only from 16o to 179 . 
 So the party 's quest for power has made it increasingly dependent on disparate allies with very different agendas . Indeed , to keep the combine together , the BJP has been obliged to put on hold the three central commitments that have made it different from other parties : legislating to build a temple at Ayodhya ; scrapping Kashmir 's special status ; and enacting a common civil code . The very strategy that has enabled the BJP to come to power has also otr liged it to dilute its agenda . 
 India 's diversity could lead to permanent coalition politics . Perhaps two main groups will emerge , but there will be big disparities within each and therefore constant compromise . Anxious to expand its image beyond Muslim - baiting , the BJp has long claimed to be a party of good governance , which does not field criminals in elections or buy defectors from other parties . But in recent years it has done both , saying it can not disadvantage itself by giving rivals a monopoly on dirty tricks . 
 So the BJP starts to look like other parties , for good and bad . And while cynics say its policy dilution is tactical , some of the changes certainly appear real . Atal Bihari Vajpayee reckons that as a political party grows and seeks a wider base of voters , it has constantly to incorporate the concerns of new groups . Indeed , even the Rss is doing so . This , as Atal Bihari Vajpayee says , is evolution , not dilution . It could yet serve India well .",750,India,A29-8257,IN TERM,True,"Atal Behari Vajpayee , the new prime minister ,",5,True

The Indian remarks are so ridiculous that they are not even worthy of refutation, according to a Chinese foreign-ministry spokesman this week. Yet a missile race has begun in South Asia, and it has plenty to do with China. 
Pakistan recently test-fired an intermediate-range missile called the Ghauri. That has allowed Pakistan to overtake India in the missile race, boasted Gohar Ayub, Pakistan's foreign minister, on May 6th. Pakistan also plans to develop a longer-range missile called the Ghaznavi. America says the technology and some components for the Ghauri have come from North Korea, and so has imposed sanctions on both countries under the Missile Technology Control Regime (MTCR), which prohibits technology transfer for such missiles. 
India, which by dint of its own efforts has developed the short-range Prithvi missile and the medium-range Agni, is now developing the Sagarika, which can be launched underwater from a submarine. India has also announced a programme to increase the range of the Agni. 
America says India has obtained some missile technology from Russia to develop the underwater Sagarika. But no sanctions have been imposed so far. Pakistan protests that it is being discriminated against. However, Russia and India claim they have not traded in any technology that transgresses the MTCR Besides, say the Americans, the Sagarika is still on the drawing board, whereas the Ghauri has been test-fired. 
The MTCR sanctions apply only to countries that trade in technology, and not to those that develop missile technology indigenously. India's bigger technological muscle means it has been able to develop missiles almost entirely by itself, whereas Pakistan generally needs help. Last month Mr Fernandes accused China of providing Pakistan with missile technology. 
The government in Delhi is greatly irritated by western talk of an arms race on the subcontinent. Yet Mr Fernandes has only made public what many officials say in private: that India faces a potentially formidable foe to the north, China, with which it has an unresolved border dispute that led to a humiliating defeat in a short war in 1962. India tested a nuclear device in 1974 to counter China's nuclear arsenal. Pakistan then developed its own nuclear option to counter India's. As China first developed its nuclear weapons to counter America's, Indian offcials see the arms race as a global affair, not a regional one. 
Mr Fernandes's comments have certainly stirred things up. He is a doughty campaigner for human rights, and has long been a stern critic of Chinese repression in Tibet. But his outburst has proved embarrassing for the Indian prime minister, Atal Behari Vajpayee, who is currently seeking to build bridges with China. Indeed, Mr Vajpayee would like to hold up India's relations with China as a model to be followed with Pakistan. India and China have agreed to set aside their border dispute for the time being and to get on with normalising economic and cultural ties. India wants Pakistan similarly to put their dispute over Kashmir on the back-burner and normalise relations in other areas. But there has been no deal. 
Indeed, the names given to their missiles by the two countries reflect the difference in approach. India's missiles are named after the elements-Prithvi means earth, Agni fire and Sagarika oceanic. But Pakistan's new missiles are named after Muslim conquerors of India. The first of these was Muhammad Ghauri, who established himself by beating a Hindu ruler, Prithvi Raj Chauhan.

India's nuclear tests have won its new government plenty of popular support at home, perhaps enough to win a majority in a snap election. But at what cost in international condemnation and to world security? 
THE yield of India's five nuclear explosions this week runs into megatons of national pride. Euphoric citizens embraced each other on the streets. Triumphalism filled the newspapers. We've shown we're a full-blooded nuclear power; we can stand up to America and give China and Pakistan a bloody nose. Economic sanctions? Who cares, national pride can't be counted in dollars. And remember, nothing much happened to China, despite Tiananmen Square. So hold firm, keep your spirits up and celebrate. 
Why did India do it? Because, says the Bharatiya Janata Party(BJP), which leads the minority coalition government, India is at last ruled by a political party with guts. No, says the opposition Congress party, the reason is that the BJP'S coalition is paralysed by internal quarrels and the bomb is a brilliant diversion. Yet in view of the euphoric public reaction, even Congress has decided to support an explosive change in policy that it avoided when in office. 
Most of India's military men are delighted with the blasts, which they say will beef up the country's security at a time when China is transferring increasing amounts of nuclear and missile know-how to Pakistan. Of the three tests on May 11th, one was of a bomb designed to fit in a missile, to show that India can now deliver nuclear warheads. Another was a low-yield test of either a trigger or a device that can be fitted into tactical nuclear weapons (like artillery shells). A third, claims India, was a thermonuclear (fusion) device. This implies that India can build a fully fledged hydrogen bomb. Two sub-kiloton blasts two days later may have been designed to allow India to carry out very small tests in future of the sort other nuclear powers conduct to check the reliability of weapons. 
Yet a bigger bang does not necessarily mean greater security. India has had a nuclear deterrent since it first tested a nuclear device in 1974. The latest tests reveal improved technology, but even crude, untested devices can be a nuclear deterrent, demonstrating a probable capacity to inflict unacceptable damage on an aggressor. Going from this to a tactical attack capability could be a costly delusion of grandeur. 
The tests were a ""terrible mistake"", said Bill Clinton on May 13th as America imposed immediate sanctions, said to be going to deny India over $ao billion. These include an end to various sorts of aid and assistance, and require the United States to oppose loans by international lending agencies, such as the World Bank and IMF. Germany, Australia and Japan, India's biggest aid donor, were among those that also announced sanctions; more are certain to follow. What will these cost India? If all official flows, and loans from international agencies and export-credit agencies are cut off, the total could be $7 billion a year. However, disbursements are always lower than approvals: last year India is reckoned to have received only some $3 billion, less than 1% of GDP. Nor will sanctions affect many credits already in the pipeline, which exceed $io billion. India's financial markets have, so far, shown relatively little concern. 
The real impact of sanctions on India will depend on whether the issue can be resolved quickly. Informally, India has told America that it is willing to accept some of the restraints of the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty, provided all sanctions are lifted. American law makes economic sanctions mandatory, but India hopes its conditional offer will enable the American administration to negotiate a waiver with Congress. Pakistan, which has nuclear capacity but has, at least until now, avoided testing (see next story), will argue that this is discriminatory. Nevertheless, some Indian experts are sanguine about the prospect of Pakistan also testing a bomb, and then both countries agreeing to sign a future test-ban agreement. 
Optimists in the BJP point out that many American officials and businessmen oppose sanctions, and view India as a major potential investment and trading partner. Approvals for American investment in India since 1991 exceed $ii billion, most of which is still in the works. The optimists hope the issue will be resolved by the time Mr Clinton visits India later this year-assuming the visit goes ahead. 
It may, however, be cancelled, White House officials have suggested. So the story may not turn out to have anything like the happy ending the BJP optimists are hoping for. Hawks, both in Congress and in the Clinton administration, want to inflict penalties tough enough to deter other countries from following India's route to nuclear prowess. 
India seems to think these risks are affordable in the short run. After all, when so much public spending disappears in kickbacks, say cynics, will aid cuts really make much difference? And when waste and corruption take their share, foreign sanctions of $5 billion or so may hardly make much difference. 
In a letter to Mr Clinton, India's prime minister, Atal Behari Vajpayee, claimed his country's security had been eroded by Pakistan's acquisition of nuclear and missile capability. He said India had always been for complete nuclear disarmament, but had to protect itself if other countries with nuclear capability could threaten it. India has long opposed the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty for discriminating between the nuclear haves and have-nots. 
Nevertheless, India has signed non-discriminatory treaties banning chemical and biological weapons, which apply to all countries. It also wants to join the proposed treaty for stopping all future production of fissile material. But it will not consent to nuclear apartheid, says Mr Vajpayee, where five countries are entitled to nuclear arsenals and others not. Yet the truth is that India would happily agree to this if it were declared an honorary member of the nuclear club. Till then, it will wax eloquent about the evils of discrimination. 
The BJP has been a fierce advocate of nuclear arms for decades, but recently appeared to be toning down its stand. Its latest manifesto was silent on the issue of testing, though it said it would ""induct"" nuclear weapons-a deliberately confusing word. It was known that, though testing would trigger American sanctions, the deployment of untested weapons would not. Until this week, the BJP seemed to have chosen this route, but it was a tactical diversion. Preparation for a nuclear blast takes weeks, so formal orders must have been given shortly after the BJP won a vote of confidence in Parliament at the end of March. 
Many observers suspect the BJP plans to go for an early election amid the euphoria it has created. If so, it might come close to winning an absolute majority. The tests have made Indians feel good. After years of worrying about economic problems and foreign pressure, voters suddenly feel virile. Like most highs, it won't last. clear ambitions, getting a good-conduct badge from the Americans. In both the Korean peninsula and the subcontinent's arms race, American and Chinese interests to some extent overlap. 
On the other hand, China might be blamed if Pakistan pushed ahead with its nuclear plans, no matter what the Chinese say. As things stand this week, Pakistan is eager to build up a nuclear arsenal. The prime minister, Nawaz Sharif, faces tough criticism from the more belligerent of his countrymen, who last year condemned his decision to ease relations with India. Now they are keener than ever to proceed with what has come to be called the Islamic bomb. Since there is a Jewish bomb, a Hindu bomb, and a series of Christian bombs, they argue, there ought to be an Islamic one too-and this is the moment to build it. India would be blamed for stepping up the race. Pakistan's foreign minister, Gohar Ayub Khan, said this week that India was pushing his country to the limit. 
Though there is little reliable information about Pakistan's nuclear capability, foreign experts are convinced that the country is poised to produce deployable weapons. Having covertly acquired technology from abroad, it is capable of producing weapons-grade material. In recent years, the government has stepped up its missile programme. The Ghauri missile, with a range of 1,5oo kilometres (940 miles), was unveiled in April. It was named, appropriately, after a 13th-century Muslim prince who fought Hindu emperors. Next in line is expected to be the Ghaznavi, named after another Muslim hero. 
A fourth war between India and Pakistan, this time using nuclear weapons, would be devastating for both countries. The material damage aside, the political fabric of the two countries might be destroyed. For Pakistan, even the cost of making a bomb would be a strain on the country's weak economy. America would block aid to Pakistan, as it has already done by announcing sanctions on India.As with India, this could result in programmes by the World Bank and the IMF being suspended. Although that might not affect India very much, this year Pakistan needs $4.5 billion5 billion to meet its current-account deficit. The possible economic bomb is the only chance to deter the nuclear one. 
Pakistanis are keeping a keen eye on how America responds to the Indian tests. Many hope that President Clinton will cancel his expected visit to India this year, and that America and other members of the UN Security Council will propose tougher sanctions against the Indians. Meanwhile, Mr Sharif is under growing pressure to go ahead and carry out Pakistan's own test, regardless of the human and economic costs. He needs time to come to his senses. ","DELHI

 Optimists in the BJP point out that many American officials and businessmen oppose sanctions , and view India as a major potential investment and trading partner . Approvals for American investment in India since 1991 exceed $ ii billion , most of which is still in the works . The optimists hope the issue will be resolved by the time Mr Clinton visits India later this year - assuming the visit goes ahead . 
 It may , however , be cancelled , White House officials have suggested . So the story may not turn out to have anything like the happy ending the BJP optimists are hoping for . Hawks , both in Congress and in the Clinton administration , want to inflict penalties tough enough to deter other countries from following India 's route to nuclear prowess . 
 India seems to think these risks are affordable in the short run . After all , when so much public spending disappears in kickbacks , say cynics , will aid cuts really make much difference ? And when waste and corruption take their share , foreign sanctions of $ 5 billion or so may hardly make much difference . 
 In a letter to Mr Clinton , Atal Bihari Vajpayee's , claimed Atal Bihari Vajpayee's country 's security had been eroded by Pakistan 's acquisition of nuclear and missile capability . Atal Bihari Vajpayee said India had always been for complete nuclear disarmament , but had to protect itself if other countries with nuclear capability could threaten it . India has long opposed the Nuclear Non - Proliferation Treaty for discriminating between the nuclear haves and have - nots . 
 Nevertheless , India has signed non - discriminatory treaties banning chemical and biological weapons , which apply to all countries . It also wants to join the proposed treaty for stopping all future production of fissile material . But it will not consent to nuclear apartheid , says Atal Bihari Vajpayee , where five countries are entitled to nuclear arsenals and others not . Yet the truth is that India would happily agree to this if it were declared an honorary member of the nuclear club . Till then , it will wax eloquent about the evils of discrimination . 
 The BJP has been a fierce advocate of nuclear arms for decades , but recently appeared to be toning down its stand . Its latest manifesto was silent on the issue of testing , though it said it would "" induct "" nuclear weapons - a deliberately confusing word . It was known that , though testing would trigger American sanctions , the deployment of untested weapons would not . Until this week , the BJP seemed to have chosen this route , but it was a tactical diversion . Preparation for a nuclear blast takes weeks , so formal orders must have been given shortly after the BJP won a vote of confidence in Parliament at the end of March . 
 Many observers suspect the BJP plans to go for an early election amid the euphoria it has created . If so , it might come close to winning an absolute majority . The tests have made Indians feel good . After years of worrying about economic problems and foreign pressure , voters suddenly feel virile . Like most highs , it wo n't last . clear ambitions , getting a good - conduct badge from the Americans . In both the Korean peninsula and the subcontinent 's arms race , American and Chinese interests to some extent overlap . 
 On the other hand , China might be blamed if Pakistan pushed ahead with its nuclear plans , no matter what the Chinese say . As things stand this week , Pakistan is eager to build up a nuclear arsenal . The prime minister , Nawaz Sharif , faces tough criticism from the more belligerent of his countrymen , who last year condemned his decision to ease relations with India . Now they are keener than ever to proceed with what has come to be called the Islamic bomb . Since there is a Jewish bomb , a Hindu bomb , and a series of Christian bombs , they argue , there ought to be an Islamic one too - and this is the moment to build it . India would be blamed for stepping up the race . Pakistan 's foreign minister , Gohar Ayub Khan , said this week that India was pushing his country to the limit . 
 Though there is little reliable information about Pakistan 's nuclear capability , foreign experts are convinced that the country is poised to produce deployable weapons . Having covertly acquired technology from abroad , it is capable of producing weapons - grade material . In recent years , the government has stepped up its missile programme . The Ghauri missile , with a range of 1,5oo kilometres ( 940 miles ) , was unveiled in April . It was named , appropriately , after a 13th - century Muslim prince who fought Hindu emperors . Next in line is expected to be the Ghaznavi , named after another Muslim hero . 
 A fourth war between India and Pakistan , this time using nuclear weapons , would be devastating for both countries . The material damage aside , the political fabric of the two countries might be destroyed . For Pakistan , even the cost of making a bomb would be a strain on the country 's weak economy . America would block aid to Pakistan , as it has already done by announcing sanctions on India . As with India , this could result in programmes by the World Bank and the IMF being suspended . Although that might not affect India very much , this year Pakistan needs $ 4.5 billion5 billion to meet its current - account deficit . The possible economic bomb is the only chance to deter the nuclear one . 
 Pakistanis are keeping a keen eye on how America responds to the Indian tests . Many hope that President Clinton will cancel his expected visit to India this year , and that America and other members of the UN Security Council will propose tougher sanctions against the Indians . Meanwhile , Mr Sharif is under growing pressure to go ahead and carry out Pakistan 's own test , regardless of the human and economic costs . He needs time to come to his senses .",750,India,A29-8257,IN TERM,True,"India 's prime minister , Atal Behari Vajpayee",4,True

Third, and perhaps most important, India needs American companies to help lobby the powersthat-be in Washington to lift the sanctions in return for India negotiating partial entry to the comprehensive test-ban treaty.

HOW good is the news that India and Pakistan are prepared to talk to each other and, eventually, to sign a treaty banning nuclear-weapons testing? Anyone who thinks this thaw will melt down South Asia's small stockpiles of nuclear weapons or unfreeze the two countries' positions on Jammu & Kashmir, an Indian region part of which Pakistan covets, will be disappointed. Nevertheless, there may be more modest grounds for hope. 
With their recent announcements at the UN General Assembly, the Indian and Pakistani prime ministers narrowed the gap with the United States, which imposed sanctions on both countries after they tested nuclear weapons earlier this year. Signing the Comprehensive Test-Ban Treaty (CTBT) is one American demand. Atal Behari Vajpayee, India's prime minister, and Nawaz Sharif, his Pakistani counterpart, now say they will do so before September 1999, when signatory countries meet to discuss how to put the treaty into effect. Both governments also recently softened their opposition to talks on a treaty banning production of fissile material used to make nuclear weapons. 
Yet neither has promised to refrain from testing missiles or arming them with nuclear warheads, another American demand. Their most encouraging commitment is simply to talk, on trade, drugs, terrorism and other ""confidence-building measures"", after the bellicose exchanges that followed their nuclear tit-for-tat. 
The Indians insist that tensions with Pakistan are no more likely to provoke nuclear war than did the half-century cold war between America and the Soviet Union, and that they can be trusted with nuclear weapons. The analogy is worringly wide of the mark. Alaska was not Kashmir: it did not harbour a sometimes mistreated minority, nor did the Sovet Union lay claim to it. Russian-backed guerrillas did not massacre American civilians. The two superpowers fought only proxy wars. Pakistan and India have fought three wars since independence in 1947 and their troops routinely shell each other across the ""line of control"" that divides Kashmir (see map). Where America and the Soviet Union had elaborate safeguards against the sort of miscalculation that could trigger a nuclear exchange, Indian and Pakistani procedures are rudimentary and often ignored. According to a recent paper by the Stimson Centre, a Washington-based think-tank, the two armies use their hotline ""perfunctorily"" and evade requirements to notify the other side of large troop movements. 
Talking broadly 
The talks, set to start on October 15th, will cover a broad agenda, as India had wanted, taking in everything from cross-border shelling and deployment of missiles to trade in energy and a proposed bus service from Delhi to Lahore. But Kashmir, which Pakistan regards as the main issue worth discussing, will also be on the agenda. It should be remembered, however, that a previous series of talks between India and Pakistan broke down in 1997 with little to show in the way of progress. 
Much depends on whether the two countries' leaders can keep politics from polluting diplomacy. The omens are not encouraging. Mr Vajpayee's government is a shaky coalition of a dozen parties, which can be rallied only by chest-thumping on highly charged issues like Kashmir. The ruling Hindu-nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party is itself split over how quickly to proceed with economic reforms. This is not a good time for concessions. 
Mr Sharif is in worse trouble. Sanctions have hit Pakistan hard and the country is struggling to repay its foreign debt. Pakistan should be eager to scramble back into the West's good graces, if only to open the way for an iMF-led bail-out that would save the country from outright default. But events are pushing the other way. The American attack on terrorist bases in Taliban-led Afghanistan, an ally of Pakistan, the threat of war between Afghanistan and Iran, and growing hardship within Pakistan are hardening opinion against America and its demands. And Mr Sharif, a moderate compared with Islamic fundamentalists and some of the military men who might seek to replace him, also faces allegations of corruption, which he denies; even so, he may now find it more politic to provoke than to placate India. 
Even under the best conditions, Kashmir will take decades to sort out. No Pakistani politician will dare suggest that the country's claim to India's only Muslim-majority state is anything less than total. With somewhat less conviction, India demands the return of that part of Kashmir now controlled by Pakistan. Some Indian diplomats say privately that the only solution lies in turning the current line of control into a permanent border. But when the country's chief negotiator on nuclear issues with America hinted at such a settlement recently, he was roundly criticised and obliged to retreat. When it comes to Kashmir, India and Pakistan seem to agree only on rejecting the idea of independence, a demand of some Kashmiri activists. 
Nor will talks lead to nuclear disarmament. Both countries refuse to sign the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, which would in effect oblige them to scrap their nuclear arsenals. The established nuclear powers are thus in the awkward position of refusing India and Pakistan entry to their club, while admitting that their weapons will not disappear. America is reluctant to withdraw sanctions, for fear of encouraging others, including Iraq or Iran, to build the bomb. Yet America knows that sanctions cannot continue forever. 
On September 29th congressional leaders agreed to give President Bill Clinton authority to waive some sanctions for one year. That does not mean they will end quickly. America will insist on progress towards regional peace, on help in stopping further proliferation and on the signing of the crsT, even though it does nothing to deprive countries of nuclear weapons, once they have tested them. America may be preparing to grit its teeth and admit two new members to the nuclear club. 
Will they conform to the club's rules or blow it up? That depends on whether their leaders can avoid using Kashmir as a bargaining chip in domestic politics-and nuclear threats as a lever in Kashmir. ","Even talks , and signatures on the test - ban treaty , will leave the region nervous 
 HOW good is the news that India and Pakistan are prepared to talk to each other and , eventually , to sign a treaty banning nuclear - weapons testing ? Anyone who thinks this thaw will melt down South Asia 's small stockpiles of nuclear weapons or unfreeze the two countries ' positions on Jammu & Kashmir , an Indian region part of which Pakistan covets , will be disappointed . Nevertheless , there may be more modest grounds for hope . 
 With their recent announcements at the UN General Assembly , the Indian and Pakistani prime ministers narrowed the gap with the United States , which imposed sanctions on both countries after they tested nuclear weapons earlier this year . Signing the Comprehensive Test - Ban Treaty ( CTBT ) is one American demand . Atal Bihari Vajpayee's now say Atal Bihari Vajpayee will do so before September 1999 , when signatory countries meet to discuss how to put the treaty into effect . Both governments also recently softened their opposition to talks on a treaty banning production of fissile material used to make nuclear weapons . 
 Yet neither has promised to refrain from testing missiles or arming them with nuclear warheads , another American demand . Their most encouraging commitment is simply to talk , on trade , drugs , terrorism and other "" confidence - building measures "" , after the bellicose exchanges that followed their nuclear tit - for - tat . 
 The Indians insist that tensions with Pakistan are no more likely to provoke nuclear war than did the half - century cold war between America and the Soviet Union , and that they can be trusted with nuclear weapons . The analogy is worringly wide of the mark . Alaska was not Kashmir : it did not harbour a sometimes mistreated minority , nor did the Sovet Union lay claim to it . Russian - backed guerrillas did not massacre American civilians . The two superpowers fought only proxy wars . Pakistan and India have fought three wars since independence in 1947 and their troops routinely shell each other across the "" line of control "" that divides Kashmir ( see map ) . Where America and the Soviet Union had elaborate safeguards against the sort of miscalculation that could trigger a nuclear exchange , Indian and Pakistani procedures are rudimentary and often ignored . According to a recent paper by the Stimson Centre , a Washington - based think - tank , the two armies use their hotline "" perfunctorily "" and evade requirements to notify the other side of large troop movements . 
 Talking broadly 
 The talks , set to start on October 15th , will cover a broad agenda , as India had wanted , taking in everything from cross - border shelling and deployment of missiles to trade in energy and a proposed bus service from Delhi to Lahore . But Kashmir , which Pakistan regards as the main issue worth discussing , will also be on the agenda . It should be remembered , however , that a previous series of talks between India and Pakistan broke down in 1997 with little to show in the way of progress . 
 Much depends on whether the two countries ' leaders can keep politics from polluting diplomacy . The omens are not encouraging . Mr Vajpayee 's government is a shaky coalition of a dozen parties , which can be rallied only by chest - thumping on highly charged issues like Kashmir . The ruling Hindu - nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party is itself split over how quickly to proceed with economic reforms . This is not a good time for concessions . 
 Mr Sharif is in worse trouble . Sanctions have hit Pakistan hard and the country is struggling to repay its foreign debt . Pakistan should be eager to scramble back into the West 's good graces , if only to open the way for an iMF - led bail - out that would save the country from outright default . But events are pushing the other way . The American attack on terrorist bases in Taliban - led Afghanistan , an ally of Pakistan , the threat of war between Afghanistan and Iran , and growing hardship within Pakistan are hardening opinion against America and its demands . And Mr Sharif , a moderate compared with Islamic fundamentalists and some of the military men who might seek to replace him , also faces allegations of corruption , which he denies ; even so , he may now find it more politic to provoke than to placate India . 
 Even under the best conditions , Kashmir will take decades to sort out . No Pakistani politician will dare suggest that the country 's claim to India 's only Muslim - majority state is anything less than total . With somewhat less conviction , India demands the return of that part of Kashmir now controlled by Pakistan . Some Indian diplomats say privately that the only solution lies in turning the current line of control into a permanent border .

WITH just a few weeks to go before elections in four states, voters in India are thinking about onions. Prices ofthat indispensable ingredient of nearly every Indian meal, sometimes including breakfast,jumped at least fivefold from last year's levels after unseasonal rains waterlogged the crop. In Delhi, the national capital, where the shortage is most acute, consumers have been queuing for hours at government-run outlets to buy onions at subsidised prices. Panic buying has hit other commodities, too. Potatoes and tomatoes have soared in price; because of a poor harvest, rice may do the same. 
The fortunes of the national government, no less, may hang on who gets the blame. The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) the senior partner in an unruly dozen-member coalition, puts most of the blame on nature. Wrong, says the opposition Congress party: the government's inept response needlessly turned a poor crop into a fullyfledged crisis. Its enemies suspect that the BJP cares more about the interests of traders, the core of its electorate, than the welfare of consumers. 
Such accusations could not be more awkwardly timed for the BJP, which faces this month the first real test of its popularity since coming to power in March. On November 25th, voters in three biggish states-Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh and Delhi-and in one tiny one (Mizoram, in the farthest east) will elect new assemblies. The prime minister, Atal Behari Vajpayee, stoutly denies that the vote will be a referendum on his leadership. Voters ""vote for local issues during the assembly elections"", he insisted in an interview with India Today, a weekly magazine. 
But Mr Vajpayee will have a hard time wriggling free of the voters' verdict, if it is unfavourable. The three larger states are among the few where something like a twoparty system prevails: voters face an almost straightforward choice between the BJP and Congress, which, though fallen on hard times, remains the biggest force in a fragmented opposition. In Delhi and Rajasthan, long-serving BJP governments are expected to lose. The party is praying that the Indian habit of toppling incumbents will bring it to power in Madhya Pradesh, where Congress now rules. Yet even if the BJP wins there, the loss of Delhi and Rajasthan would mean overall defeat. 
That would have several consequences, none good for Mr Vajpayee. One would be to feed the illusion, assiduously promoted by Congress supporters, that they represent the only serious challenge to the Hindu nationalism espoused by the BJP. The claim will be spurious whatever the election result. Support for Congress is patchy across India; the party barely figures in several states, including the two most populous ones, Uttar Pradesh and Bihar. Still, if Congress does well on November 25th, it will get more co-operation from its rivals in national opposition. A decisive win would also entrench Sonia Gandhi as the party's leader, stifling opposition from those who regard her as a foreign-born arriviste who is where she is only because she married into the Nehru-Gandhi dynasty. 
A rejuvenated Congress might not topple the government even if it could. Any coalition it leads is bound to be as fractious as the sJr-led one. Far cannier, perhaps, to let the BJP govern feebly for another year or two, while Congress bolsters its claim to primacy within the opposition. 
How has the BJP come to this pass little more than half a year after taking office? Incessant sniping by its coalition partners is one reason. Another is that, while the BJP has confounded the direst prophecies of its critics, it has fallen short of its supporters' expectations. 
The opposition and much of the outside world had expected the BJP to stir up communal tensions. But so far it has avoided picking violent fights with Muslims and other religious minorities. Its attempts to make Hindutva-Hindu culture and customs-the defining feature of Indian nationhood have been sporadic and half-hearted. In October the opposition and some of the BJP's allies joined forces to snuff out an attempt by the government to inject Sanskrit and Hindu scriptures into the curriculum for state schools. In economic matters the BJP promised swadeshi self-reliance. Yet its dealings with foreign investors have been marked by confusion rather than hostility. Only in foreign policy has the BJP's nationalism really spread its wings. India's nuclear tests last May remain the BJP government's only distinctive act. 
And that is the trouble. The campaign promise that mattered most to Indians was not swadeshi but suraj, good government, a break with the self-absorbed and corrupt governance with which Indians are familiar. This the BJP has failed to deliver. It has yet to match its predecessors' corruption, but neither has it challenged special interests that rob Indians of the benefits they have a right to expect from the state. When the urban affairs minister, a respected lawyer, tried to transfer a senior civil servant, the bureaucracy stopped him. When he suggested opening his ministry's files to the public, cabinet colleagues told him to wait. The BJP damaged its credentials by trying to remove the independent-minded chief of the government's anti-corruption Enforcement Directorate. 
Where the BJP has ruled longer at state level, it has not done much better. In Delhi, which it has governed for five years, voters still smart from constant power cuts during a sweltering summer. They feel menaced by rising crime, dirty air, and now by spiralling prices for vegetables. In an ith-hour rescue attempt, Mr Vajpayee sacked the city's chief minister and replaced him with India's redoubtable information minister, Sushma Swaraj, who began checking up on absentee police supervisors in a series of well-publicised late-night inspections. But this is the sort of thing a government should do at the beginning of its tenure, not at the end. 
The BJP's proudest boast is that India's economy has weathered the crisis afflicting many developing countries better than most. Even pessimists expect GDP to grow by 4.5% in the fiscal year ending on March 31st. But growth does not feel strong. For one thing, it is spread among a population growing at nearly 2% a year. And it is bypassing much of the economy. Industry is retrenching, after over-investing during the mid-199os, though there are now glimmers of a recovery. Cheap imports from SouthEast Asia have clobbered domestic producers of steel and chemicals. Banks are choking on bad loans (see page 77). Agriculture, which was expected to prop up the rest of the economy, is looking feebler after the late rains. 
The government seems to realise that something is wrong, and that further reform can put it right Late last month Mr Vajpayee and the finance minister, Yashwant Sinha, announced schemes to buck up the stockmarket and spur investment. Some, such as allowing companies to buy back their own shares, and letting privatesector suppliers provide Internet access, will deliver modest but tangible benefits. 
But the more ambitious the promise, the vaguer it seemed to be. The government wants to let foreign companies go into life insurance, which should in time mean extra savings that could go, for instance, into infrastructure. But the reform could be blocked by staunch nationalists in the BJP. The government talks of ""drastically"" cutting subsidies after the state elections, of chopping the fiscal deficit to 3% of GDP, of reforming labour laws. This is all vital to India's economic health, but unattainable unless the BJP defies special interests and parties within its own coalition. 
Real reform will make the party unpopular with large groups of voters. But at least that would be the right sort of unpopularity. Unfortunately, until now the BJP has courted the wrong sort. ","The government nervously faces its first real test of popularity

A NEWSPAPER cartoon sums it up: ""The mushroom, sir,"" smirks Sonia Gandhi at the prime minister, Atal Behari Vajpayee, ""is no substitute for the onion."" 
Mr Vajpayee had given India its proudest moment in years last May when he tested five nuclear bombs. But he got no credit for it in state elections where voters were enraged by the soaring price of onions and other staples. As the results were counted this week, they showed that Mr Vajpayee's Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) had been ejected from the governments of Delhi, India's capital, and Rajasthan, and Mrs Gandhi's Congress party had taken its place Congress lost power in tiny Mizoram in the north-east, but shocked pollsters by fighting offa BJP challenge in Madhya Pradesh, the biggest ofthe four contested states. The humiliation of the ruling party was complete. Now pundits are counting the months until Congress marches back into national government, an Italian-born import to the storied Nehru-Gandhi dynasty Sonia is the widow of Rajiv Gandhi, Nehru's grandson-at its head. 
The voters' verdict was clear enough: the BJP's eight months in office leading a fractious I8-member coalition have been a bust. The consequences are less obvious. The numerous parties in the lower house all have their own notions of how to profit from the BJ's humiliation. Guessing the outcome would be like predicting a chess game in which the pieces move according to rules of their own invention. 
At first, the coalition seemed to acquire the strength of desperation. One by one its obstreperous members many of them as spooked as the BJp itself by Congress's victory, swore fealty to the alliance. How durable those pledges prove to be, though, depends largely on Congress. 
The main opposition party is savouring a victory beyond all expectation.Young voters, Dalits (once untouchables), even Sikhs, who have not forgotten a Congress-inspired pogrom against them in 1984 (after the murder by her Sikh bodyguards of Rajiv's mother, Indira Gandhi), flocked back to the party that ruled India for most of its first 50 years of independence. The BJP turned in its worst-ever performance in Rajasthan; in Delhi's assembly it has been reduced from a thumping majority to a snivelling minority. But how will Congress now exploit its triumph? For the moment, Mrs Gandhi seems willing to wait. Her partyhas twice brought down governments recently, only to be punished at the polls. She prefers to let the coalition fall ""on its own"", and then, rather than piece together a feeble alternative from the current parliament, to call new elections. Congress would probably supplant the BJP as the biggest party. It could not rule without allies, but it could hope to become the master of a coalition united by distaste of the BJP. 
This strategy carries risks. The coalition may not fall on its own, especially if potential defectors know they will have to face new elections. And Congress's glow could fade. Voters are more hostile to the BJP than they are friendly to Congress; as the aroma of over-priced onions dissipates, the BJP's fortunes could recover. 
A swifter way to power would be to piece together a government from today's parliament. That is what most of Congress's potential allies want, in part to arrest the sudden momentum behind its drive to become the sole secularist opponent of the BJP. In Congress's renewed popularity with Muslim and low-caste voters some saw intimations of a revival for it even in Uttar Pradesh, India's biggest state, from which the partyhad been all but ejected.Jaipal Reddy, a canny parliamentarian from the shrinking Janata Party, contends that Congress need not call new elections to govern successfully. Because Congress is objectionable to fewer parties in parliament than the BJP, it has a wider choice of allies and can therefore play one off against the other. Parties of the left, like the Communist Party (Marxist), so abhor the BJP's Hindu sectarianism, thinks Mr Reddy, that they would loyally back a Congress government even though the Communists are Congress's fierce rivals in two states and dislike its ideas of economic reform. 
To survive, Mr Vajpayee is in need of a mandate. The BJP entered office promising to deliver ""good governance"", but rising prices were merely the most painful evidence of its failure. With defeat widening a rift between pragmatists like Mr Vajpayee and Hindu ideologues, the BJP seems incapable of defining good governance, let alone providing it. 
A worthy definition would include further economic liberalisation, but this has little electoral appeal. According to surveys by the Centre for the Study of Developing Societies, less than a fifth of the population is aware that India's markets opened up in the early 199os. Besides, the family of Hindu-nationalist groups to which the BJP belongs has rebelled against a measure regarded by foreign investors as the acid test of reform, the opening of insurance to foreign capital. On December ist, when a galaxy of Indian and foreign corporate bigshots were in Delhi for an ""India Economic Summit"", the parliamentary-affairs minister announced that parliament would not take up insurance reform during its current session. Retraction was swift, but the confusion over policy lingers. 
BJP ideologues want Mr Vajpayee to resume their pet project of re-casting India as the Hindu holy land. He has strong reasons not to pander to them. His coalition partners will not stand for a resurrection of plans to strip Muslims of their own code of personal law, and other projects dear to the Hindu right. In their first post-debacle meeting, they condemned rising persecution of Christians. Mr Vajpayee realises that stirring up communalism would merely drive minorities and secular-minded Hindus swiftly into Congress's ready embrace. 
Economic populism looks like another non-starter, with budget deficits soaring to unacceptable levels and inflation on the rise. The government could please voters cheaply by making a serious stab at rooting out corruption and improving administration, but there is no reason to think it would succeed any better than before. Another option might be baiting Pakistan, but that would be a dangerous way to score political points. 
Could Sonia Gandhi do better? It is a pretty sure bet that she would keep onion prices and communal passions down. So low are Indians' expectations of their leaders, that may be enough. ","Congress is poised to return to power , but not just yet

Big Mac index offers a guide to whether currencies are at their ""correct"" level. It is based on purchasing-power parity-the notion that an identical basket of goods and services should cost the same in all countries. The Big Mac PrP is the exchange rate that would leave hamburgers costing the same in America as abroad. The chart calculates the under- or overvaluation of emerging-market currencies against the dollar. Thus, dividing the local-currency price of a Big Mac in Malaysia by its American price produces a dollar ,pp of 1.63 ringgit. The actual dollar rate is 3.80 ringgit-ie, the currency is 57% undervalued. The other Asian currencies are also undervalued. At the other extreme, the currencies of Venezuela, Argentina and Israel are overvalued. The chart also shows that the yen is 9% undervalued against the dollar; the r-mark is 14% overvalued.  1999 2000 will be a year in which the world shifts its balance. America's magnificent economy will slow; Europe and Asia will pick up the slack. Overall, the world will increase its wealth by 3.5%: a fine achievement. For the third of our population that lives in China and India, prosperity will grow at twice the speed of the rich world, to all our benefit. It will be the first year in which the majority of people on the Internet do not speak English: in America the web will be used as much by women as men. The Internet will become the language of the world. There has never been a revolution of this speed. The marriage of mobile phones and the Internet will give it a new twist. 
Many of the gloomy predictions-and gloomy realities-of the 20th century will be happily left behind. So too, for a while, will be that greatest curse: war between nations. There will be conflicts as some nations break up-in Central Asia and perhaps in Western Sahara, after a referendum on independence in July. But no wars. To be cheerful about 2000 consider only this. Of the 30 major elections that will be held, 16 will be in countries that 25 years ago were dictatorships. There will be four elections to watch. In March, Taiwan will hold an open and free vote; it will expose as humbugs all those Asian autocrats who hold that the East requires a Confucian and necessarily authoritarian (or corrupt) way of government. In July, the Russians go to the polls: an exercise that will prove the futility of democracy at the ballot box without a rule of law in the land. Russia's misery will continue. Look to Mexico on July 2nd. A country that has been a byword for cruelty, chaos and privilege is, not before time, to hold genuinely free elections in a society that is, piecemeal, equally genuinely reforming itself. And on November 7th, there is America's election. Months of scrutiny and campaigning and expense will produce two nearly identical candidates, each of whom will have his views carefully honed to a meaningless average. But lucky America to have evolved a system where leadership leaves its dogmas aside at the winning post. Note that whoever is elected-Democrat or Republican-will be a highly educated man. America's system is easily mocked but it does not produce fools. 
2000 will be a good year for Britain. Its economy will grow rapidly, one of Europe's star performers yet again. This trajectory means that Britain's wealth may overtake that of France for the first time in nearly 50 years. Britain's new-found prosperity comes from its trade with fellow Europeans. It will be a depressing oddity that, for yet another year, public debate in Britain will be dominated by animosity towards its neighbours. Elsewhere nationalism will be healthily relegated to sport. Watch out for the Olympics that start in Sydney in September, if you miss the old tribal certainties of fluttering flags and swelling pride in the home team. 
The World an 2000 is printed in Britain and America. It will appear in 16 languages from Japanese to Greek. Its mistakes, therefore, will be widely disseminated. I hope those things about it that are accurate or entertaining will also be well read and enjoyed. 
Dudley Fishburn  1999 Elections to the White House and the Kremlin will hold the world spellbound, predicts John Parker. Each will produce a marginal improvement. 
In July Russia will elect a new president. On November 7th America will do likewise. These elections mark the passage from the first to the second generation of post-cold war leaders. The two votes could hardly seem more different. One is taking place after eight years of unparalleled economic boom in a country where voters are mostly satisfied with the institutions of state. The other comes after eight years of unparalleled bust in a country where almost every state institution is in crisis. 
Nevertheless, there are links, and revealing ones. Both Bill Clinton and Boris Yeltsin have concentrated on their domestic economies, when they could. Both are ending their presidencies in scandal and disgrace. In both cases, their successors will have to inch their way towards a new international engagement. 
Russia's election is the more uncertain and the more constrained. Whoever wins will want to be a vigorous new broom: more interventionist at home, more aggressive abroad, harder to deal with all round. But at the same time, he will be hamstrung by Russia's enfeebled system of government, its corrupted economy and the calamitous condition of its armed forces. In practice, therefore, the year will see a struggle between the assertive ambitions of the new president and the ruinous realities of the country. This will be unnerving for everyone, Russians most of all. 
The American election is less explosively disruptive. 2000's election is exceptionally open. There is a chance that all three elected institutions of government might change hands. That has not been true for generations. Despite the years of prosperity, the presidential race will be close-far closer than appears from opinion polls. But Republicans have captured seven of the past 12 presidential elections. With the Democrat administration tainted by scandal, they are better placed to win back the White House than any time since 1980: the race is George W Bush's to lose. 
The House of Representatives is also likely to change hands. The Republicans' popularity is abysmal. They are defending the narrowest majority since 1951 (six seats)-and there are at least 30 close races. The Senate, where the Republicans have a majority of ten and are defending only half a dozen open seats, is less likely to change hands. But even here, a strong swing towards the Democrats would be enough to change control. In short, you could have almost any combination of outcomes: a continuation of the current division of government (Democratic president, Republican Congress); the mirror image; or unified government under either party. And as if that were not enough, it is unlikely that anyone will win well enough to dominate either chamber. This leads to the firm prediction that there will be more of the sort of gridlock that has characterised American government for the past few years. This need not be a weakness. There are no urgent matters in American life that require political solutions or sustained leadership. And the American public is too diverse, too splendidly kaleidescopic, to be led by some political or moral dogma, as the Republican right is learning to its cost. (Russia, by contrast, could well fall far such a shallow appeal.) 
The recent huge surpluses on the federal budget have fundamentally altered American politics: they mean there are no dire economic consequences from failure to agree on spending measures. All that happens as a result of gridlock is that the national debt is repaid faster-a desirable outcome. At home, gridlock matters little. But abroad, it matters more. The next ten years are likely to be a time of greater international instability than the past ten. The new Russian president is one reason for that, Chinese assertiveness another, nuclear proliferation a third. Then there is the unending rash of small conflicts that will require American attention and perhaps military intervention. While there is a broad public consensus that the United States should exercise some sort of leadership role in the world, there is no agreement on individual hard cases. This means the new president will face tougher choices, without a popular mandate for any particular action and, very possibly, without much support in Congress. There would be every reason to lament this muddle if the past ten years had not shown that a muddled America can still act swiftly and benevolently-something that will be long denied to a corrupt and bankrupt Russia, whoever its leader might be.  1999 America's slowdown will need to be balanced by growth elsewhere. Financial markets are unprepared for this, warns Clive Crook. 
Not for many years has the fortune of the world's biggest economy seemed so detached from conditions elsewhere. The United States continues to roar along. Early in 2000 it will set a new record for its longest uninterrupted economic expansion. You might have expected this breathless growth to help other countries: when America works up a sweat, as it were, the rest of the world gets a fever. Not this time. Europe, Japan and much of the third world have been growing only slowly of late. The global economy is weirdly out of joint. 
In the coming months this growth imbalance will start to be corrected. One thing is as clear as anything can be in the economic predictions business: the American expansion is going to cool. What is unclear is how abrupt the slowdown will be, and whether it will be offset by faster growth in the rest of the world. Could the braking be so severe as to drag the world back into recession? The odds are against it-but the risk is not to be dismissed. 
To many American economic commentators, this will seem a much-too-gloomy assessment. The recent mood in the United States has been triumphant, and understandably so. Growth in 1999 as a whole will come in at close to 4%, which is remarkable in the eighth year of expansion. But that is not the best of it. After nearly a decade of growth, the unemployment rate has fallen to barely 4%-yet there is no obvious sign, so far, of rising inflation. Many analysts suppose that this stunning performance will continue indefinitely. This year Wall Street raised its valuations of American corporations to levels that make sense only on that very assumption. The old rules say this cannot be right. Of course they do, reply the optimists, but the old rules no longer hold: the revolutions in computing and telecommunications have repealed them. 
Even if such exuberance is justified, the view that growth in America can continue for ever at its present rate is foolish. Suppose that the ""new economy"" is real; suppose that the long-term trend of growth in productivity is markedly steeper than before, thanks to advancing technology. Even this would be too little to sustain the American miracle. The reason is that inflation in the United States has been suppressed in the past couple of years by temporary factors-by those useful imbalances in the world economy, in fact. 
Europe's turn 
Slow growth in Europe and severe recessions in much of the third world have been a blessing in disguise for the United States. They created global spare capacity, pressing down on prices. Oil and other commodities have been dirt-cheap for most of the past two years, reducing consumer-price inflation in America by as much as a full percentage point a year during 1996-98. And sluggish demand outside the United States has also enabled America to finance its current-account deficit (reflecting its excess of investment over saving) at low interest rates and without a depreciation in the dollar. 
Now that demand is picking up in Europe and Asia, both of these special price-suppressing factors will fade: the cost of inputs will rise, and financing the deficit is going to call for higher interest rates or a lower dollar, either of which will push prices up. This is to say nothing of pressure for higher wages, which is also sure to mount (at the present very low rate of unemployment) unless growth cools. So if the economy fails to slow spontaneously, inflation will start to climb; and if inflation starts to climb, the Federal Reserve will have to brake the economy deliberately by raising interest rates. 
For these reasons, American growth will need to slow soon even if the ""new economy"" is real. Nonetheless, the more truth there is to the view that productivity growth has improved, the milder this slowdown will need to be. If the optimists are right about the new supply-side revolution, a soft landing both for the economy and for Wall Street is a pretty safe bet. The trouble is, the evidence so far suggests they are wrong. Growth in American labour productivity has improved in the past two years, as the optimists never tire of pointing outbut this improvement has been entirely concentrated, so far at least, in one small sub-sector of the economy (namely, rc manufacturing). Perhaps productivity growth will improve across the board in the years to come: it has not done so yet. 
This has two disturbing implications. The first is that the slowdown necessary to avoid inflation breaking out in the United States in 2000 will be noticeably large. The most recent iMa forecasts (which do in fact allow for some modest supply-side improvement) show growth slowing by more than a full percentage point, to 2.6%; even so, inflation drifts gently upwards. As it stands, that looks like a soft landing-though Wall Street in its present mood might find it something of a shock. Which brings us to the second worrying implication. If the new economy is a mirage, or anyway much less real than it has been made out to be, then present stockmarket valuations of American companies are indefensible. Once you combine the need for a cooling of aggregate demand with a stockmarket that is both overvalued and seemingly unprepared for even the mildest disappointment, you have the necessary ingredients for a much less graceful touchdown. 
In the past year, the world economy has had a lucky escape, and America's magnificent economy deserves the credit. As economies flagged around the globe, America kept the wheels of global commerce turning. Now a grand rebalancing is needed. If the world's luck holds, the coming year will see gently slower growth in America, a curbing of passions on Wall Street (but no crash), all combined with increasing strength in Europe, Japan and the emerging markets. It could happen-but don't bet more than you can afford to lose.  1999 Muslims will in the 2000s demand and win the freedom that their leaders have long denied them, predicts Brian Beedham. 
With fingers only lightly crossed, it is possible at the close of the 1990s to hope that the decade's biggest geopolitical ogre can now be laid to rest. Since the end of the cold war, with a ruined Russia and a China that still does not quite know what it wants to do in the world, too many people have been willing to believe that the next great danger to global peace and freedom would be the rise of a ferocious new Islamic superpower. As things stand, that looks increasingly unlikely. 
The two major Muslim countries where revolutionary Islam had seemed most dangerous, Iran and Algeria, are in different ways-one much better than the other-probably at last getting it under control. Even in remoter patches of chaos such as Sudan and Afghanistan things no longer look quite as bad as they once did. And, tighten those crossed fingers, quite a few Muslim countries have lately been making their first hesitant experiments with the idea of democracy. 
In Iran, once thought of as the epicentre of the clerical earthquake, something new is happening. A relatively free election in 1997 gave the Iranian presidency, by an overwhelming majority, to the liberal Muhammad Khatami. The ""supreme leader"" who stands above the president, the veteran Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, then proved much less intransigent than had been expected. The ayatollah has helped to get Iran back on speaking terms with much of the Arab world and with Europe, and has let President Khatami extend at least a tentative hand of reconciliation towards America. 
The struggle in Iran is not over. Ayatollah Khamenei remains more conservative than President Khatami; liberal newspapers can still get shut down; February's parliamentary election will show whether Iranians can vote as freely in 2000 as they did in 1997. Yet something has changed in the past few years. A middle ground has opened up between the most unbending of Iran's religious fanatics and the irreconcilables at the other end of the ideological spectrum. 
Something similar has happened in Algeria, though in a different way and far more Moodily. The savage civil war which began in 1992, when the army insisted on cancelling an election that a relatively moderate Islamist party looked like winning, seems to be grinding to a close. The army has more or less got on top of the brutally extremist guerrillas the war inevitably created. But the army, or at least its better part, has also been shaken by the war-by the huge casualty list, by the atrocities its own men have committed, by the damage done to the economy, and by the disapproving stares of Algeria's neighbours in Europe. The generals have therefore decided to let the politicians begin a dialogue with the more flexible Islamists the army had spurned in 1992. 
There are new flickers of light in other dark corners. Sudan's Islamists have suddenly accepted the principle of a free press, and have sent a small smile towards the country's exiled opposition. Even the Taliban regime in Afghanistan-the fundamentalists so narrow-minded that even the other fundamentalists noticed-shows some signs of rational thinking. 
The improvement is not confined to the parts of the Muslim world run by religious zealots. There are signs that Jordan and Morocco may grow more liberal under their young new kings; in the Gulf, little Kuwait, Qatar and Oman are letting more people vote, and vote more freely, in their elections; and on the other side of the globe huge Indonesia is currently digesting the consequences of its first real attempt at letting the people choose who will govern them. 
Add what may be the most telling fact of all-that the countries of the Muslim world, even the single-- language Arab part of it, have made virtually no progress towards real political solidarity over the past 50 years-and that nightmare of a pugnacious new Muslim superpower can be seen for what it is: the sort of bad dream you wake up from, shaking a puzzled head. 
The reality is less frightening than the dream for two reasons. The first is that ""the Muslim world"", though united by more or less the same religious beliefs, is otherwise divided into a dozen separate cultures and sub-cultures. Arabs are different from Turks, Turks from Persians, Persians from Pathans, Pathans from Punjabis, Punjabis from Bengalis, Bengalis from Malays and the Muslims of Indonesia. Even the 22 countries that share the Arabic language remain distinct political entities, held apart by disruptive variations of economics and history and by their rulers' desire to keep a grip on local power. It will never be easy to construct a potent international force out of so loose a club. 
The other part of the explanation will make it even harder. Like everybody else, today's inhabitants of all these assorted countries know far more about the rest of the world than their parents did, thanks to the electronics revolution of the late 20th century. The effects are an awkward mixture of envy and distaste; but for most Muslims, poor and unfree, the envy will probably be the stronger. They will increasingly want a richer and freer future than is likely to be provided either by religious puritans or by corrupt army-backed dictators. 
Until now, few Muslims have been able to use their individual judgment about anything. Except for the handful recently made rich by oil, most of them have always lived in rural or pastoral poverty; being poor, they have been easily kept under the heel of dictatorial rulers; above all, the interpretation of Islam-of God's will-has long been the monopoly of a handful of selfselected wise men who believed they knew what others should think and do. 
Now, the economics of the modern world offers an escape from poverty. One group of Islamic revivalists is urging that all good Muslims should have an equal voice in the interpretation of God's will. If individual judgment can be used in religion, it will surely be used in politics too. The same sort of change, for rather similar reasons, began in the Christian world half a millennium ago. Look forward to a Muslim Reformation. 
Brian Beedham: associate editor, The Economist.  1999 The British economy may soon overtake the French, for the first time in a generation, predicts John Grimond. Don't take it too seriously. 
Few rivalries provide as much entertainment for onlookers as that between France and Britain, or rather between their peoples, the Frogs and the Rosbifs. They do not hate each other, as some neighbours do. But nor do they love each other. Each admires certain features of the other: cuisine, chic, paysage on the one hand; dogs, literature, phlegm on the other. But the qualities they respect in each other are far outweighed by those they despise. 
And hence their rivalry, a rivalry made all the more intense by what the two countries have in common: a similar sense of nationhood, a similar proud history, a similar claim to a role on the world stage, a similar diminution of that role, a similar size of population and a similar size of economy. It is this economic similarity that will ere long excite feelings of superiority (among the Brits), derision (among the French) and perhaps amusement (among others): some time in the not-toodistant future, headlines in British newspapers will triumphantly proclaim that Britain's gross domestic product has overtaken France's. 
The claim will be phoney, but never mind, it will have numbers to support it. They will show that when the value of French GDP, measured in euros, is converted into dollars, it is smaller than that of Britain's GDP, measured in pounds and then also converted into dollars. Calculated this way, the two economies are indeed about the same size already: France's GDP was $1.4 trillion in 1998, Britain's $1.37 trillion. Though the French economy has been growing nicely in 1999, at about 2.3%, and is set to do even better in 2000, the euro has been weak and the pound strong. 
The British newspapers that will trumpet Britain's new economic prowess most loudly will be those that also fulminate against the Eu and especially its latest piece of ""integrationist lunacy"", the single currency. Yet if the claim that Britain's economy has overtaken France's can be made at all-and it should be pointed out that, in the foreign-exchange markets, no future event can ever be considered certain-then it will be a claim that can be made only because of the euro. In other words, had it not been for horrible economic and monetary union (so ruthlessly promoted by the diabolical Frenchman, Jacques Delors, when he ran the European Commission), Britain's economy would still be unambiguously behind France's. 
That is where it is, on any sensible reckoning, and where it is likely to stay, at least for a while. To compare economies by valuing them at market exchange rates can give an utterly misleading picture. Exchange rates vary wildly, and are influenced by factors such as interest rates, capital transfers, government policy and so on, not merely by pure international trade. That is why inter-country comparisons are usually based on the concent of purchasing-power parity, which values currenties in terms of how much is required to buy an identical basket of goods and services in the countries concerned. On this reckoning, the British economy (at $1.30 trillion in 1999) is about 4.5% smaller than the French one ($1.37 trillion). 
However, even this calculation may well be inaccurate. In all countries, plenty of economic activity, from building and baby-sitting to prostitution and drug-dealing, goes unrecorded. It is conceivable that, if all of this were taken into account, Britain's economy might turn out to be genuinely bigger than France's. 
Conceivable but unlikely. It is widely believed that it was a decision to include the underground economy in the official figures that lay behind il sorpasso, Italy's celebrated, yet shortlived, overtaking of Britain back in 1987. But the underground economy is almost certain to be larger in a highly taxed and highly regulated country, such as France, than in a laisser faire country such as Britain. 
But does size matter? Since the two countries' populations are virtually the same-France's is smaller by less than half a million people, unless the overseas departments are included-a bigger economy means bigger GnP per person, so the French are, on average, richer than the Brits. This will not come as a surprise to the millions of Britons who go to France for their holidays each year. They may not be able to see that the French have more telephones and more washing-machines, or even that they have lower infant mortality and deaths from cancer. But they can hardly help but notice that the French have swankier clothes, smarter trains and proportionately more cars. Competitive Brits may, however, take comfort from the latest Human Development Report issued by the United Nations. In 1999, its annual ""human development index"" put Britain ahead of France for the first time. So there.  1999 The Spanish-speaking world is acquiring a style, sophistication and influence that, says Daniel Franklin, will affect all our lives. 
Starting in 2000, would-be American presidents will be at a dangerous disadvantage unless they can appeal to voters in Spanish as well as in English. Hispanic-Americans are growing rapidly not only in numbers (31m and rising) but in confidence and clout as well. Beyond the United States, too, the Spanish-speaking world, which extends across more than 20 countries in three continents and includes over 350m people, is set to become a force to be reckoned with once again. Prepare for a new breed of cultural and commercial conquistadors. 
This may sound implausible to those who have come to take inexorable Anglo-Saxon pre-eminence for granted. A crude but credible view of the Hispanic world's history is that, after Spain's imperial power peaked, it has been downhill for much of the past 400 years. As the Spanish-speaking world's influence declined, that of the English-speaking world rose, carried ever higher first by the British empire and then by America. Even now, it would be easy to look at the troubles of Latin America and conclude that it is too early to talk of a turn in fortunes. You will see guerrilla insurgency (Colombia), debt default (Ecuador) and economic recession (much of South America). Swathes of Spanish-speaking countries are still desperately poor and plagued by high crime. In too many of them, scant regard for the rule of law holds back development. 
Yet look again, and you will see that many of the pieces are in place for a powerful Hispanic resurgence. One of the pieces is democracy. All but one of the Spanish-speaking countries are now democracies of sorts, the exception being Fidel Castro's Cuba. Democracy, of course, is no guarantee of good government. But it is an improvement on dictatorship. The countries with the deepest democratic roots, from Chile to Costa Rica, tend to have the strongest civil institutions. 
Next, there is trade. The inward-looking, import-substituting model of economic development having failed, Latin Americans have sensibly abandoned it. They have opted instead to open markets and enter into trade-liberalising agreements, whether with one another (Mercosur, the Andean Community, the Central American Common Market) or, in Mexico's case, with its North American neighbours. Thanks to the North American Free Trade Agreement, Mexico's economy has boomed with America's. 
Hip, hip, Hispanidad 
In the United States itself, it is demography that is giving Latinos a lift. By 2050 the country's Hispanics may number as many as 100m, perhaps a quarter of the population (compared with 11% now). Today's Latinos are young and proud of their roots. All of a sudden, Hispanic is hip, from musica to movies, from la vida Iota to Jennifer Lopez and Salma Hayek. The influence is spreading beyond the obvious Spanish-speaking areas: hence the popularity of salsa clubs across Europe and the enthusiastic crowds for Ricky Martin in London. An upwardly mobile ""Generation N"" (the Latin equivalent of Generation X), which was invented and copyrighted by a Miami entrepreneur, is starting to flex its muscles. 
The final piece of the puzzle lies across the Atlantic. Since the end of the Francoist dictatorship in 1975, Spain, too, has swapped dictatorship for democracy and opened itself to the world through its memberships of NATO and the Eu. It is reaping the rewards. A foundermember of the single currency, it is now in Europe's super-league, gaining in wealth, weight and prestige. The centuries-long downward trend in Spanish fortunes has turned sharply upwards. Newly confident, Spaniards are increasingly looking not just to Europe but beyond, to Spain's former colonies. 
All this creates a potent mix for Hispanidad. Companies can expand their horizons across the continents. There will be a growing number of Spanish-accented multinationals, both spreading from Spain (like Telefonica, a telecoms giant, Repsol, an oil company, and Banco Santander Central Hispano) and from Latin America (like Mexico's Cemex). Publishers and Internet adventurers will flock to exploit an increasingly enticing Spanish-speaking market. Spanish speakers themselves will start to wallow in the attention and spread their influence far and wide-through trade, music, family values, and Spanglish words that enter into common usage-like true children of Columbus. Before long, the world will realise that globalizacion is a Spanish word.  1999 JANUARY

Compiled in association with The Economist eCalendar Companion. Software to personalise your electronic diary. wvu.bookshop.economist.com  1999 On Tuesday November 7th, America will probably follow Mae West's dictum: ""When forced to choose between two evils, I pick the one I have not tried before."" A full year of campaigning, in which none of the serious protagonists is anything but decent, responsible and colourless, will have left American democracy dull but in good shape. America's tedium will be the world's respect. 
Two parts of the American system, however, are going seriously wrong. First, despite all the hoopla, only around half of America's population will vote (compared with 72% in British and 95% in Australian elections). The winner will be lucky to have the backing of 25% of the public, and so will have no firm mandate. When the electorate is so little involved it is no wonder that new presidents enjoy so little popular loyalty or goodwill. 
Second, the election will produce, once again, a Congress that will soon find itself at odds with the White House. A recent poll showed that only 14% of the electorate wanted a divided government. The 2000 elections definitely give voters the opportunity to try a new arrangement: to have both the White House and Capitol Hill in the hands of the same party. Control of Congress is up for grabs. In the House, the 26-seat Republican majority installed in 1994 has dwindled to just five. In the Senate, Republicans have held a 55-45 advantage since 1994 and are favoured to retain control, but Democrats have at least a mathematical chance to take over. Yet these numbers disguise the truth: Capitol Hill has evolved into an institution that can define itself only through its arguments with the White House, regardless of which party has nominal control. 
Not so the Supreme Court, where change is also afoot. Three of the justices are over 70-Chief Justice William Rehnquist and Justices John Paul Stevens and Sandra Day O'Connor. With a fourth, Ruth Bader Ginsburg, having undergone surgery for cancer, the prospects are that the next president will be able substantially to reshape the judiciary. More than 70 other federal judgeships are vacant and unlikely to be filled before 2001 owing to conflicts between the president, who nominates judges, and the Republican Senate, which must confirm them. (The political hijacking of the appointment process is another troubled element in the constitution that needs sorting out.) 
The presidential election campaign has been under way for most of 1999 owing to the decision of several states to move their primary elections to the early months of 2000. A majority of the delegates to both national conventions will be selected by March 15th. 
Among Republicans, it would take a cosmological intervention to deprive George W Bush of the nomination. He is 30 points ahead of any rival in national opinion polls. He has the support of a majority of his fellow Republican governors and of members of Congress. And he has collected three times as much in campaign contributions as his nearest rival, billionaire magazine publisher, Steve Forbes. The only suspense on the Republican side is whether Mr Bush will somehow stumble. 
The Democratic contest, on the other hand, has become intense, with the front-runner, Vice-President Al Gore, strongly challenged by a former senator, Bill Bradley of New Jersey. Mr Gore is both blessed and cursed by his eight years as Bill Clinton's loyal vice-president. He is blessed because he has cemented ties with powerful Democratic interest groups, because Mr Clinton will use the powers of his office to help him and because, if the American economy stays strong, Mr Gore will be seen as part of a winning team. 
But Mr Gore is cursed by the fact that the Clinton presidency has been stained by multiple scandals. The public seems anxious to move on to cleaner pastures. As the joke goes, ""After Clinton, the United States wants to take a shower, and poor Al Gore is going down the drain."" Mr Bradley, a former professional basketball player who spent 18 years in the Senate, has based his challenge to Mr Gore on two arguments: that he is not an ""inside"" politician and that he will address problems-child poverty, the 45m who lack health insurance-that he alleges the Clinton-Gore administration has neglected. 
Despite Mr Bradley's progress, Mr Gore retains institutional advantages in the nomination struggle. It will take 2,189 delegate votes at the August Democratic National Convention in Los Angeles to win. The party reserves 18% of those ballots for ""super-delegates""-governors, members of Congress and members of the Democratic National Committee, who are free to vote as they wish. They are overwhelmingly in Mr Gore's camp. The other 80% are awarded according to state primary results. 
Along with the presidency, separate races will be under way for House and Senate seats. (Watch out for Hillary Clinton's run for the New York Senate seat.) Congressional Democrats, with help from the White House, have paid almost exclusive attention to winning back control of the House by framing issues, raising money and recruiting candidates. The most contentious issues arise from the inability of a divided government to pass major items on the national agenda-Social Security and Medicare reform, tax reductions, gun control or patients' rights legislation. 
There will be two other important twists to look for in the 2000 elections. First, the governors and state legislators in office over the next few years will redraw electoral boundaries in the wake of the decennial census, possibly handing an advantage to one party or another for the next decade. Second, these elections will be the first in the world in which the Internet will play a crucial part. All the tricks of democracy-from policy initiatives to character assassination-will move on to the net.  1999 For the past couple of years, America's economy has basked in luck. It has grown robustly, while a combination of low commodity prices and a strong dollar have kept inflation out of sight. Foreigners' willingness to pour capital into America has funded the spending spree. In 2000 this luck will be severely tested, since the economy is beset with two big weaknesses: stock prices are too high and savings are too low. These problems pose a nasty threat to the country's nineyear expansion. A market crash would leave bubbly consumers feeling suddenly less wealthy: spending would plummet, and so would the economy. 
The fear of that kind of ""hard landing"" will give rise to some anxious moments in 2000. But although the economy will slow from a gallop to a trot, and although the stockmarket and the dollar will show some humility, the chances are that America's luck will hold. There will be no Armageddon on Wall Street, no dramatic dollar crisis, no collapse of consumer spending, and certainly no recession. Unless Alan Greenspan, chairman of the Federal Reserve, makes some grave errors, America's economy has every chance of achieving a ""soft landing"" as it slows to a more sustainable pace. 
Two related factors will force a slowdown from the near record growth rates that have been the recent norm: foreigners and fears of inflation. Foreigners have been bankrolling America's recent spending spree. While the rest of the world looked in turmoil, investors were happy to pour their money into America's booming markets. As a result, the country's current-account deficit-which reflects the difference between how much America saves and invests, and is funded by capital inflows from foreigners-has ballooned. 
In 2000, this deficit will reach nearly $400 billion, or 4% Of GDP, a record level, higher than that of the Reagan boom of the mid-1980s. However, after 2000 the current-account deficit will slowly fall. Foreigners will see improving opportunities for their cash elsewhere in Japan and Europe, and they will worry that America is using their capital to finance low savings rather than booming investment. As a result, they will start to shift their money elsewhere. Scarcer capital in America will mean higher interest rates; growth will slow. 
America's mind-boggling consumer spending (which has jumped by an average of 5% in 1998 and 1999) has been fuelled by a huge fall in personal savings. As their stock portfolios have fattened, Americans have felt wealthier and saved less. In 1993 households saved around 7% of their disposable income. By 1999 the figure was barely above 2%. Were this decline to continue, Americans would soon be spending more than their disposable income. Clearly this trend is unsustainable, which is why 2000 will see much slower growth in spending, thus slowing overall growth some more. 
As foreigners shift their money to other economies, the dollar will fall. A weaker dollar will boost America's exports (export volumes could grow by over 8% in 2000, more than twice as Fast as 1999). Import growth will slow, as foreign-made products become relatively more expensive in dollars. But a weaker dollar will also aggravate fears of inflationary pressure, which will be rising anyway for other reasons. 
The spectacularly benign performance of prices-consumer-price inflation is near 30-year lows despite booming demand-has a variety of causes. In part it is due to increases in the productivity of American workers; in part it is the result of lucky breaks such as falling commodity prices and the strong dollar. But the dollar's weakness in 2000 will carry the threat of higher prices in the shops; so too will higher commodity prices. At the same time, the cost of labour may pick up. By early 2000 the unemployment rate will be pushed below 4% and the scarcity of workers will eventually push hourly wages upwards. 
If inflation suddenly accelerates, the Federal Reserve will have to raise interest rates sharply, popping the bubble on Wall Street and bringing about the hard landing that investors fear. But the likelihood is otherwise. 
Even so, tight labour markets, a weaker dollar and firmer commodity prices will prompt the Federal Reserve to tighten short-term interest rates modestly. The result will be higher costs for borrowers throughout the economy. This in turn will trigger a gentle slowing in spending and investment, together with a modest and overdue correction to the excessive prices on Wall Street. And yet, even as America slows down, American triumphalism will remain undented. By accomplishing a soft landing, America will have pulled off a miracle as remarkable as the past years of unbroken growth. 
Zanny Minton-Beddoes: Washington correspondent. The Economist. 
United Nations subscriptions go up for Japan and down for America, though it still owes $1.2 billion. Is Uncle Sam world policeman or a free-rider?  1999 America's pockets will feel the weight of change in the early months of 2000, when a new dollar coin is placed in circulation. The coin, which is set to replace the rarely seen Susan B. Anthony dollar, will once again be graced by the figure of a woman. Unlike her predecessor she'll be a native American. On the obverse side of the coin will be the figure of Sacagawea, the Shoshone teenage mother who travelled from the Northern Great Plains to the Pacific Ocean with the Lewis and Clark expedition of 1805. Strapped to her back will be her son, Jean-Baptiste. The design marks a radical departure from the harsh profiles of previous American presidents. Despite the failure of the Susan B. Anthony coin, which remains in use only for vending machines, the us mint is confident that the Sacagawea coin will succeed. With its distinctive gold colouring and smooth edge, it is expected to be popular in the pocket. It will not be possible to confuse it, as the Susan B. Anthony coin could be, with the nickel. And there is a widespread feeling that the single dollar bill has become too bulky and difficult to pocket. Its face value is too low for a paper note. Few other wealthy countries have such small units of currency expressed in paper. So, does this mean the demise of the dollar bill? The government certainly intends to give wide circulation to the new coin as it will cost less to maintain and will last longer than the paper note. This time the betting is that the dollar coin will take hold. While in this reforming mood, how long will it be before the one-cent coin is phased out?  1999 In 1790, the United States became the first modern nation to undertake a comprehensive count of its population as a routine responsibility of government. The constitutionally mandated decennial census was part and parcel of a revolutionary concept in government. If the new nation's democratically elected governments were to be truly representative of the people, then the government itself would have to make regular efforts to determine just how many of those people there were. 
Whereas the Senate was established to represent the interests of the states, the House of Representatives was designed to represent the interests of individuals. The Constitution dictates that every decade a census be used to apportion representatives among the states according to the relative size of their populations. 
From the very beginning, the American nation has been characterised by rapid population growth and movement. Hence the census has as much to do with political power shifts as it does with population shifts. With so much at stake, the census has always been a magnet for controversy. George Washington was unhappy with the first ever count of the American people. (He thought that it was too low.) True to tradition, the 2000 census, which will be conducted on April 1st, will be greeted with grumbling from all sides. 
Indeed, over the past few years the 2000 census has been shaping up as the most contentious since 1920, when rural lawmakers refused to reapportion House seats based on data showing that more Americans lived in cities than in the countryside. On the surface, contemporary Democrats and Republicans have been fighting over methodology: whether the Census Bureau should employ sophisticated statistical sampling techniques or an old-fashioned head count. 
But the real battle has been over who will be counted. Despite its $2.6 billion price tag, the 1990 census was a debacle, leaving an estimated 10m people uncounted, many of them members of Democratic-leaning minority groups. To avoid repeating such a massive undercount in 2000, the Census Bureau had been advocating the use of sampling-a process whereby 90% of people are physically counted and the remaining 10% are statistically inferred. Hoping a higher tally of minorities would help them create new friendly political constituencies, the Democrats championed the bureau's cause, but to no avail. 
Citing the Constitution-and not so secretly wishing for another undercount-the Republicans opposed sampling. They demanded the actual (and perhaps impossible) enumeration of every person in the country. A former House Speaker, Newt Gingrich, went as far as to call sampling a ""dagger pointed at the heart"" of the Republican majority and filed suit against the government to stop it. The Supreme Court ruled in his favour and ordered the Census Bureau to conduct a traditional enumeration. 
Therefore it is a foregone conclusion that the 2000 census will vastly undercount the American people. Despite a scheduled $100m national ad campaign to ""make everyone count"", Americans of all stripes will duck census counters out of a distrust of government and a growing concern for privacy. 
The variety of recent immigrants means that language barriers will pose significant challenges to the Census Bureau in 2000. Nonetheless, the new data will reveal a nation that is becoming more racially and ethnically complex than ever before. In the 2000 census, America will be more heavily Latino than it was in 1990. And in part due to the anti-immigrant fervour in the first half of the decade, more immigrants will be naturalised American citizens than ten years before. 
Yet, even while documenting the diversification of the American people, the 2000 census will also mark the beginning of the end of America's archaic official racial accounting scheme. 
In 2000, for the first time, Americans will be able to identify themselves as multiracial. While not necessarily the best solution, the Census Bureau will nonetheless allow respondents to tick any or all of the four primary racial boxes: African-American, white, Asian/Pacific Islander, or American Indian/Alaska Native. In the past, the Census asked respondents to pick only one of the above categories. (Hispanic remains a separate ethnic-and non-racial-classification.) 
The multiple-race option came after three years of emotional public debate between multiracial activists and traditional minority civil-rights groups. The Clinton administration rejected a proposed self standing ""multiracial"" category that would have included all people of mixed racial background. 
Lobbied hard by ethnic advocacy groups that feared the diminishment of their constituencies if a multiracial category had been approved, the White House stumbled on the multiple race option as a political compromise. Census 2000 will acknowledge multiracial Americans even while upholding the old classifications. 
However modest, the change in rules will affect policies like affirmative action or the drawing of minority legislative districts. But the most long-lasting consequence of the new census form is likely to be administrative confusion. It is not at all clear how the multiracial data will ultimately be used. Will the daughter of an African-American father and a white mother be considered black when state legislatures are attempting to forge black-dominant political districts? And what about a citizen who says he is a combination of black, Asian, and white? Will the government consider him all or none of the above? 
Despite the steady increase in Asian immigration to the United States, the 2000 census might very well count fewer Asian-Americans than in 1990. In a 1996 test run, 30% of Asian-American respondents identified themselves as multiracial. 
And although the Census Bureau does not expect many Americans to tick more than one box in 2000-past policy has encouraged people to choose one heritage over the other-multiracial Americans will increasingly make their presence felt. Since 1970, the population of multiracial children has quadrupled in the United States. Between 1960 and 1990, the number of once-illegal unions between races increased 900%. In contemporary California, one in every six births is a mixed-race child. However flawed, the 2000 census will officially mark America's new found freedom not just to acknowledge its past, but also its future heritage.

Imagine: planes flying above cities beaming down radio, video and data communications. Experiments begin in 2000 that might give satellites a run for their money.  1999 Yachting's grandest trophy, the America's Cup, will be up for grabs in a series of nine races off New Zealand starting on February 19th. This cup always brings out wallets, egos, national pride, skulduggery and skill. Just to enter you have to post a $250,000 bond. But this is nothing compared with the cost of developing a yacht and professional team, which is upwards of $35m. Yet no less than 11 syndicates will have their keels in the water, representing six countries: France, Italy, Japan, Spain, Switzerland and the United States. (Note the shameful absence of Britain, which founded the competition in 1851 but then repeatedly lost it.) The cup has been won away from the United States only twice, the first time in 1983 by Australia and the second time by New Zealand in 1995.  1999 Americans will reach deep into their pockets in 2000 and give $200 billion to charity. This will not just be an unprecedented amount; it will be more than all the other 5.8 billion citizens of the world put together will donate. Britain, which does not think of itself as a mean-spirited country, will give just over 44 billion ($6.4 billion). 
Americans give to charity for many reasons. The first and foremost of them is that they are a generous and civic-minded people-words that many other countries find hard to say. There are secondary reasons: the tax system encourages philanthropy, not because it is lax but because it is wise. There is a recognition that individuals give more shrewdly than the state. In Britain, by contrast, the state believes that it alone should be bountiful-and the recent arrival of the national lottery, whose earnings are, in part, allotted to charities by state-appointed bodies, illustrates the point. Since the lottery began, personal giving in Britain has declined. In the past 20 years the proportion of households in Britain giving to charity has declined from 34% to 29%. 2000 will see Britain giving less, in real terms, than five years ago. 
In the United States giving will surge. The two most popular beneficiaries will be religious organisations (they will receive nearly $80 billion) and educational charities, notably universities ($28 billion). But the fastest-growing charities will be the wildlife organisations and those concerned with protecting the environment. America's huge personal wealth is a guarantee that this trend will continue. Many of the country's older millionaires will choose not to pass all their money on to their already rich and middle-aged children. And many of California's computer millionaires actually feel that it is morally wrong to do so. This is a trend that will gather pace in the years ahead-but not outside America.  1999 Eight short centuries ago, in the summer of 1212, many thousands of children, most of them boys around the age of 12, set out from France and the Rhineland to reconquer the Holy Land by the force of their love. The children fared miserably, but some adults did rather well: many of the relatively few young crusaders who got as far as Italy were captured by merchants and sold into slavery. The episode may be worth recalling as a new children's crusade, of a different sort, gathers force in America. 
In 1996, few people noticed when the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation and the American Cancer Society spent $30m to establish a new activist campaign. The National Center for Tobacco-Free Kids, as it was called, opened a fresh front in what it called the ""war on tobacco"". The new breed of activist noticed that most smokers first pick up a cigarette when they are minors (16 years old, on average). Never mind that 16 is not most people's idea of a ""child"", and that most teenagers who try cigarettes soon drop them: by concentrating on smoking and ""kids"", the activists thought, they could change the tenor of the public debate. 
So it was that anti-smoking campaigners characterised smoking as a ""pediatric disease"", and tobacco merchants as predators upon the young and helpless. The children's crusade against tobacco was not, by itself, decisive, but it went far to create the political climate that produced a settlement, in late 1998. Tobacco companies will now charge American smokers more for cigarettes while furnishing $246 billion-a fortune by any reckoning-to state governments, lawyers and anti-smoking campaigners. 
Humbug for all 
This success in 1998 was not lost on others in 1999. The supporters of stricter controls on guns in America-like the anti-smoking activists-had long been stymied by the political ferocity of their opponents and by the public's philosophical qualms about restricting law-- abiding adults' access to legal goods. In 1999, after several horrific episodes in which boys committed mass shootings in schools, activists began portraying guns as specifically a threat to children. Hillary Rodham Clinton, the president's wife, reflected the tone when she proclaimed: ""Guns and children are two words that should never be put together in the same sentence."" 
In fact, children (meaning adolescents, mainly) and guns have mixed comfortably in America for many years. A study for the American Justice Department has reported that young people who are given guns and taught to use them are less likely to commit crimes, including crimes involving firearms, than are young people who lack access to guns. The problem in America is not children and guns, but adults and guns. Turning the argument into one over ""kids"" did not, in reality, have as much to do with the welfare of children as with the ambitions of adults. 
In August 1999, the Environmental Protection Agency> America's main environmental regulator, announced its first restrictions intended speciFically, the agency said, to protect children. The link between the restricted pesticides and children was not altogether convincing: children eat more fruit and vegetables than adults (so the argument went), and their bodies are still developing, so pesticides would hurt them disproportionately. 
At about the same time, a report issued by congressional Republicans called for new measures restricting and otherwise discouraging violence in films, television shows, music and other media of mass communication. This, too, was pitched as a children's crusade. ""We must now devote ourselves"", said the report, ""to reducing the amount and degree of violence in our media and to shielding our children from such harmful depictions."" 
If 1999 saw the formula for children's crusades refined to a science, 2000 presents boundless opportunities to generalise its application. For example: 
Al Gore, Bill Clinton's vice-president and would be successor, hopes to move towards a broad national health insurance-succeeding where Mr Clinton failed-by promising health care for all children. 
As 2000 approached, Congress was considering seven bills-such as the ""Children's Protection Act,"" the ""Children's Defense Act,"" and the ""Protection of Children from On-Line Predators and Exploitation Act""-to regulate the Internet in the name of children. 
Firearms regulation, newly a ""kids""' issue. will heat to a boil as the lawsuits that dozens of states and cities have brought against gun manufacturers move: to trial. 
In the longer term, the repetition of ""Protect the children!"" as a rallying cry for activist adults spells its own undoing. Usually, however, gimmicks succeed for a while before ennui sets in. That should make 2000 a good year for campaigners of all stripes to see how many causes can be sent through the American legislatures and courts on the backs of innocent children. 
All change on Wall Street. The New York Stock Exchange, the world's largest, will become a forprofit business with its own stock listing. Shares will be quoted in decimals, not fractions.  1999 Robert Rubin, former secretary of the United States Treasury, gives warning that conventional wisdom is not a good guide to the future. 
There are two widely accepted ideas concerning economic matters in the years ahead. First, that there are powerful new forces at work-especially globalisation and the technology of the information age-that are creating immense change at a rapid pace and that this constitutes a new paradigm. And, second, that financial markets and market-based economics have replaced dirigiste economics and relegated government to a relatively minor role in economic affairs. 
Having spent 26 years on Wall Street and six-and-a-half years in government, living all of these changes first-hand, I believe that each of these statements is both powerfully right and powerfully wrong. 
Clearly, barriers to capital and trade flows have greatly decreased; the movement of capital, as well as goods and services, across borders has greatly increased; and technology is advancing rapidly and in profoundly important ways. The result seems almost surely to be significant productivity improvements, especially in America, though the official numbers do not yet appropriately show them and some of the claims being made may well be excessive. All of this holds great promise for the economies of all nations that are open to change and to trade, and that have sound policies in areas ranging from fiscal discipline to education. 
However, there are increasing numbers of commentators who extrapolate from all of this the idea of a new paradigm that is thought to lead to unprecedented conclusions with respect to business cycles, market valuations and the like. They are advocating a modern-day version of the famous thesis set forth in 1928 by Irving R. Fisher, a noted Yale economist, that we have reached a ""permanent plateau of prosperity"". 
I share the view that economic change is producing great benefits, and that the improved understanding of economics should lead us to better responses than the monetary and fiscal policies in the years following the 1929 crash. But everything I have experienced suggests that, at core, economic conditions and markets are grounded in the human psyche. That is, confidence or the lack thereof profoundly affects markets and economies, and confidence in turn has throughout the history of markets and economies tended to swing from excesses in one direction to excesses in the other. 
Perhaps the commentators are right and this is no longer operative, for the first time in human history. But the alternative is also possible. And our actions should reflect that alternative possibility. Public policymakers must continue to work intensely at the longterm project of reforming the architecture of the global financial markets. Private-sector managers must do what the private sector never does during good times: identify and weigh risks appropriately in decision-making. My impression is that the long period of good times in the industrial nations, and the rapid recovery when markets faltered, in 1987 and 1998, have dulled concern about risk. 
Another important piece of the great change taking place is the move towards market-based economics and away from dirigiste economics. This has led many commentators to say that financial markets, trading markets and the market-based economy have become so much more powerful than governments that public policy matters relatively little. 
There is no question, in my view, that government efforts to determine market prices in opposition to market forces cannot prevail over any period of time, and there is no question that global financial markets have become a powerful disciplinary force with respect to fiscal discipline, and monetary and other policies. 
On the other hand, that is only part of the story. Government still has a critically important role: different but no less important than the central planning and state ownership roles of yesteryear. 
We need governments 
Government must perform the functions that markets by their nature cannot or will not perform optimally, and these areas provide the underpinnings and framework for the market-based economy. Economists capture this idea with concepts like externality and market failure. Examples are public education, environmental protection, national defence and social safety nets. Of course, government can also mismanage, as by undue regulation, or by unsound fiscal or monetary policies, and that can be highly damaging. 
A critically important debate for the years ahead will be where this line between what markets do and what government does should be drawn. And this debate will be about not only what functions government should be involved with, but also, when government is involved, to what extent government should perform a given function itself and to what extent it should provide incentives or subsidies for the private sector to perform that function. School vouchers, private-sector prisons, trading markets in pollution rights, are good examples of battlegrounds in this debate in the United States. 
So, the more things change, the more things stay the same, in the sense that in the final analysis markets are about human beings and human nature. We should act to realise fully the potential for good in these powerful changes, but we must also eschew complacency and, in both the public and private sectors, realistically appraise risk and act accordingly. We must also allow market forces to operate where they can maximise our well-being, but support the government in performance of its critically important role. 
The future of the global economy is most promising, but to realise that promise the public and private sectors must act wisely on many fronts, sometimes in conflict with the conventional wisdom of the moment. the ambitions of adults.

In the longer term, the repetition of ""Prefect the children!"" as a rallying cry for activist adults spells its own undoing. Usually, however, gimmicks succeed for a while before ennui sets in. That should make 2000 a good year for campaigners of all stripes to see how many causes can be sent through the American legislatures and courts on the backs of innocent children.  1999 In 1986 the price of oil plummeted from $30 to $10 a barrel, and Texas quaked in its oversized boots. Businesses went under, cities became virtual ghost towns, and oil men cut down their prime rib consumption at Houston's posh Petroleum Club. In 1998 oil prices once again tumbled through the floor, yet the Lone Star state barely noticed, having branched out from its monogamous relationship with oil towards one with software and semiconductors. It's not just Texas. Throughout America's south-west and mountain region states that were once at the mercy of commodity prices have undergone a high-tech revolution, creating thousands of new jobs and transforming themselves into America's new technological hubs. It is now the fastest-growing region in the country, and in 2000 it will flex its muscles, finally emerging as a political and economic powerhouse, which the two coasts can no longer ignore. 
While a booming economy lifted all American boats during the 1990s, the rising tide was perhaps most beneficial to the interior West region. The region led the nation in job creation and personal income growth during the decade, as cities such as Denver, Austin, Boise and Salt Lake City, once sleepy and regionally focused, emerged as global centres for telecommunications, software and biotechnology. By embracing new technologies, the region has stabilised its economic base, no longer the victim of boom-and-bust cycles in industries such as oil, copper and silver. It is now home to high-tech powerhouses such as Dell, Intel, USWest and Compaq. Technology companies will continue to move into the area in 2000, taking advantage of the region's low tax, pro-business climate. 
Another reason for the economic surge can be seen at the 37 border crossings between the United States and Mexico. The elimination of trade barriers after the passage of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) in 1993 has brought a rapid expansion of trade between the two countries, with all of the new commerce flowing through the American south-west. According to Philip Burgess, president of the Denverbased Centre for the New West, NAFTa has created a ""border economy"", growing 10% each year, from the Gulf of Mexico to the Pacific Ocean, with border areas in Texas, New Mexico, Arizona and Southern California joined in an economie alliance with northern Mexico. 
Fueled by new industry and a burgeoning job market, the region has experienced the fastest population growth during the 1990s, with almost 21% growth during the decade compared with the national rate of 9%. Of the 25 fastest-growing cities in America in 2000, 15 are located in the interior West. The Census Bureau predicts the booming growth will continue well into the 21st century. This growth is far from evenly spread, however, as the vast majority of the economic and demographic expansion has been in the cities. In Arizona, 80% of the state's (largely technology based) job growth is in the Phoenix area-evidence of what many experts see as a problematic ""digital divide"" in the region. 
The changing demographics are partly due to what Marc Perry of the Census Bureau calls the ""All the way there, half the way back"" phenomenon, That is to say, easterners who migrated to California and have become disillusioned with the state's urbanisationand for some, with California's growing Latino population-have sought new frontiers in the interior states. This demographic shift will benefit the region politically in the census, as six of the nine congressional seats expected to migrate as a result of the census will go to the interior West. More people means more money, as federal funds to the states are determined by census estimates. 
In addition to increasing its presence on Capitol Hill, the region will have a significant impact on the presidential election, having developed into the most solid Republican block in the nation. Despite predictions a decade ago that diversified economies in the west would attract more eastern liberals to the region, population growth has not altered the region's traditional conservatism, long fuelled by scepticism of federal government and regulation. The Republican Party now holds 14 of the region's 18 Senate seats, and all nine of the governors' mansions. 
In an attempt to boost the region's clout over the presidential nomination process, several western politicians pushed for an early ""Big Sky"" primary in 2000, in which the western states would all hold their primaries on the same day, as the southern states do on Super Tuesday. It failed, so most of the western states will now hold their primaries too late in 2000 to have an impact on who earns the two parties' nominations. On election day, however, the impact will be unmistakable. The betting is that all nine states will vote for the Republican nominee in November 2000. 
Mark Mazzetti: south-west United States correspondent, The Economist.  1999 Americans will look on with seeming carelessness as their political system appears to be hijacked in 2000 by the power of money. They will know perfectly well that their democracy is being distorted by vast payments of cash from ""special interests"". They will accept with insouciance the most cynical view of politicians selling their souls and votes to the highest bidder. But they will convey little sense of urgency to their elected representatives of the need to fix the role of money in elections. And they will place campaign-finance reform near the bottom of their ranking of domestic public policy priorities. 
The political elites are likewise in no hurry to mend things. Saturation press coverage of fund-raising scandals during the 1996 presidential election and a deluge of emotional newspaper editorials since then have been insufficient to embarrass Congress into patching the most gaping loopholes in current law. 
Political financing has already become a major focus of newspaper reporting during this election cycle. The phenomenal early fundraising success of George W. Bush, the Texas governor, drew the spotlights. (He raised $37m in the first half of 1999, almost three times the previous record.] His subsequent decision to forgo public matching funds (making him only the third candidate to reject the public money that has been available since 1974) was the signal political event of the pre-primary presidential campaign. A close second was how easily Bill Bradley, a former senator, raised $12m in contributions. This has immediately made him a credible challenger to Vice-President Al Gore for the Democratic nomination. 
Both parties have announced that they hope to raise over $200m for their non-federal or ""soft money"" accounts. These funds have the virtue of being able to receive donations from corporations or trade unions that would otherwise be prohibited; and there are none of the limits on the size of contributions from individuals that apply to federal or hard money accounts. During the 1996 and 1998 elections, the parties discovered ever-more creative ways of spending soft money, thus craftily avoiding the restrictions embedded in federal campaign finance law. 
Campaign-finance reform will get more attention because two presidential aspirants, John McCain, a Republican senator, and Mr Bradley, have made it centrepieces of their campaigns. Mr McCain's decision to scale back his reform bill, by abandoning efforts to regulate election-oriented ""issue"" advertisements but retaining the ban on soft money, was not sufficient in the autumn of 1999 to garner the 60 votes needed to end the Republican filibuster and pave the way for some changes in the law. But it will provide a platform for Mr McCain and his allies to try to shake the public from its lethargy. Even in the unlikely event that those efforts were successful and the current Congress enacts campaign-finance reform, it would be too late to have any effect on the 2000 campaign. 
The prominent role of political money hardly makes America unique among the world's democracies. The experience of other countries in grappling with these problems suggests that the rules of political finance are important but secondary in shaping democratic accountability. Indeed efforts to deal with it have often yielded disappointing results. Scandals have arisen in many countries before and after reforms were adopted. Levels of corruption are not strongly related to the extent of public subsidies or the intensity of regulation of party and campaign finance. 
Idealism or reality? 
This is not a counsel of despair. It is a brief for realism. There is a tension between the reality of economic inequality and the ideal of political equality. Political parties and candidates for office need money to compete successfully in elections. Relatively few citizens have the personal means or desire to contribute to political campaigns. Under these circumstances, efforts to prevent concentrations of wealth from undermining political equality may conflict with freedoms of speech and association. The challenge in future will not be to eliminate the tension altogether but to manage it better. 
In the case of America, that means first of all restoring credibility to campaign-finance laws, some enacted as long ago as 1907, that have in recent years been shredded beyond recognition. First eliminate soft money and restore the long-standing prohibition against political financing from corporate and union treasuries. More controls on election-oriented ""issue"" advertisements would sharpen the transparency of campaigns. Adequately funding the account for public financing of presidential elections would avoid a repeat of the embarrassment of 2000 when the Treasury will be unable to meet its legal obligations to match the private contributions of presidential candidates. 
Beyond these immediate but critical fixes, reformers will continue to wrestle with slowing the money chase. They will want to foster the participation of small donors and grass-roots organisations. They will call for an appropriate role for political parties in campaign finance that does not relegate them to mere instruments for money-laundering. But these reforms will fail to balance the interests at stake. In short there seems to be no alternative to muddling through-which is exactly what will happen. 
Thomas E. Mann: W. Averell Harriman Senior Fellow in American Governance, the Brookings Institution.  1999 Hollywood will turn its gaze upward to the heavens and forward to the future. Two of the biggest blockbusters of 2000, both due out in March, will examine bids to colonise the most fashionable of planets, Mars: Walt Disney's ""Mission to Mars"" and Warner Brother's ""Red Planet"". In ""Space Cowboys"", another Warner Brothers film, ""a bunch of old guys"" led by Clint Eastwood venture into outer space, while in ""Titan AE"" (Fox), a teenager goes in search of a spacecraft that can save the world. Steven Spielberg reheats an old Philip K. Dick science-fiction story, ""Minority Report"", about a judicial system in which potential murderers are arrested before they can do any harm and, in its third sci-fi blockbuster of the year, ""Battleship Earth"", Warner Brothers succeeds in finding a new backdrop for John Travolta. 
Hollywood's other great inspiration at the millennium will be the past. Two of the best historical blockbusters for years will be Sony's ""Patriot"", a CivilWar epic starring Mel Gibson, and DreamWorks' ""Gladiator"", directed by Ridley Scott. Miramax is capitalising on its successful ""Shakespeare in Love"" with souped-up versions of Hamlet, Othello and Love's Labour's Lost. (The studio has wisely avoided overstraining the public's appetite for doublet and hose: Kenneth Branagh has turned ""Love's Labour's Lost"" into a 1950s musical.) 
The history that Hollywood is happiest with, however, is its own. Disney opens the year with 
""Fantasia 2000"", with seven new pieces set to music, including one by Shostakovich, and closes it with ""102 Dalmatians"". There will be sequels to ""Mission Impossible"" (which, if we are lucky, may explain what was going on in the first film), ""Beavis and Butthead"", along with ""Scream 3"" and a prequel to the Flintstones series. Those quintessential 70s figures, Shaft and Charlie's Angels, will return. Hollywood is also making yet another attempt to revive the musical, not only with ""Love's Labour's Lost"" but also with ""Moulin Rouge"", starring Ewan McGregor and Nicole Kidman. 
There will be the usual rash of adaptations of best-selling novels. Mr Spielberg will lay a practised hand on ""Memoirs of a Geisha"", George Clooney will wrestle with the ocean in ""A Perfect Storm"" and Leonardo Di Caprio will discover that a Thai paradise is not all it is cracked up to be in ""The Beach."" 
The most unexpected development of the year will be Hollywood's loveaffair with hairdressers. In January, Warner Brothers will release ""The Big Tease"" (motto: ""he came, he coiffed, he conquered""), about a gay Glaswegian hairdresser who takes on the Los Angeles hair establishment. (The studio is showing the film to hairdressers before its official release, on the grounds that nobody is better placed to generate word-of-mouth publicity.) Later in the year Miramax will release ""Blow Dry"", the story of the rivalry between two hairdressing salons in a small town, written by the author of ""The Full Monty"". 
Adrian Wooldridge: West Coast correspondent, The Economist.  1999 Canada is arguably the world's most successful country: year after year it tops the United Nations' Development Index. But year after year-and 2000 will be no exception-it becomes a little more like the United States. (It is, after all, slightly less wealthy than California.) Indeed Canada's politicians will spend the coming months promoting themselves with an enthusiasm seldom seen north of the border. They may not outdo their electioneering colleagues further south, but open displays of political ambition are hardly what Canadians have come to expect from their leaders. 
The prime minister, Jean Chretien, tired of being underestimated by friend and foe alike, will strive for a place in the history books alongside more flamboyant predecessors such as Pierre Trudeau and Brian Mulroney. The opposition leader, Preston Manning, will risk his leadership of the Reform Party with continued attempts to forge a nation-wide coalition with the Progressive Conservatives (the ""United Alternative"") against Mr Chretien's Liberals. Lucien Bouchard, premier of Quebec, will be tempted yet again to put to a referendum the question of the secession of his francophone province from the anglophone rest of Canada. 
Mr Bouchard has talked of calling a referendum only if there are ""winning conditions"", but until the wording of the cuestion is defined, these ""conditions"" will also remain conveniently undefined. Most francophone Quebeckers suspect they will never get the respect they deserve from their anglophone compatriots, but does that mean they will vote to leave Canada? Most polls suggest that they want to have their gateau and eat it: they flirt with secession but worry about its consequences, and so prefer, in the end, to avoid it. 
Throughout the coming year politicians will be indulging their ambitions just as Canada's economic outlook, so robust at the end of the 1990s, takes on a less favourable aspect. As growth slows in America, so it will in Canada too. The question is how painful the slowing will be. Roughly a third of GDP consists of exports south of the border. In other words, if and when the American economy sneezes, the Canadian economy will catch a cold-especially in Ontario, whose exports to America account for two-fifths of its GDP. 
All of which means that in politics, 2000 will be a frustrating year, especially for those talented Liberals, the finance minister, Paul Martin, for example, and the Newfoundland premier, Brian Tobin, who reckon they, not Mr Chretien> would make better prime ministers. Partly to quieten the rivalry, Mr Chretien has promised to lead his party into the next election, and this need not be until June 2002. Although many analysts reckon that Mr Chretien will use the millennium as a graceful way to bow out early, why should he? After all, he rather enjoys living at 24 Sussex Drive, the Ottawa residence that comes with the job. With the economy slowing, the politicians posturing more than normal and the Quebec issue once again in the headlines, some Canadians will feel their 21st century is getting off to an inauspicious start, not least because unemployment, around 8% for most of 1999, will start to edge up again. 
Yet behind the headlines the reality will be more promising. The competitive spur of NAFTA and the reforming instincts and fiscal rigour of Mr Martin (no respecter of the Liberals' wishy washy tradition) mean that the country's balance sheet will still look remarkably healthy. Canada will be the only G7 country other than America to be in a financial surplus-and that surplus will apply not just at the federal level but also in most of the provinces. Moreover, the effects of America's slowdown will be mitigated (especially for British Columbia) by a recovery in Canada's Asian markets and, at some point, a rise in oil and commodity prices. 
The difficulty will be to persuade Canadians to keep up the good work. The slimming of the public sector will lead to more outbreaks of industrial unrest, such as the 1999 nurses' strike in Saskatchewan, and more worries for the future of Canada's universal health-care system and its publicly financed schools and universities. Yet at the same time Canada's businessmen, conscious that they cannot hide forever behind a weak currency, will clamour for lower taxes. 
And rightly so if Canada is to staunch the ""brain drain"" that flows south each year in the form of thousands of well-educated professionals. Ironically, the greater the flow, the more determined most Canadians-from the prime minister on-will be to distinguish themselves from Americans. (One flow that may stop in 2000 is the flow of Canada's water to some states in America. This is certain to cause a row or two.) 
In some ways this will be an exercise in futility: Canadians watch the soap operas of America's television rather than the worthy offerings of the publicly owned Canadian Broadcasting Corporation; and they regard recognition in America, not Canada, as the mark of business, sporting or artistic success. 
Yet at the same time, with a defiant glance southwards and regardless of their interprovincial squabbles, they can justly celebrate Canada's many strengths. These include a disproportionately large contribution to international peacekeeping; a sense of social compassion; and a belief that as a nation of immigrants Canada is better served by a policy of tolerant ""multiculturalism"" than the ""melting pot"" notion to which America pretends. 
As more and more of their companies are bought by American investors, Canadians will try to make sure that what is Canadian by nature remains that way. If Ottawa's politicians can be confident about Canada and not defensive, then the country will remain truly distinctive from its neighbour for many years to come. 
Wild salmon will make their last Atlantic run. In 1975 there were 800,000 of these noble fish: 25 years later there will be an unsustainable 20,000. 
John Andrews: correspondent for The Economist, now based in Paris.  1999 Beset by growing social instability, a faltering economy and heightened tensions with Taiwan and America, China will hardly be in a mood to celebrate what it had hoped would be a year for trumpeting the successes of its ""socialist modernisation"". 
Although 1999 was symbolically important in marking the 50th anniversary of communist rule in China, its leaders have long attached even greater importance to 2000 as a target date for achieving key development goals such as the elimination of poverty and the eradication of illiteracy among the young and middle-aged. But it now seems likely that the significant progress that China has made towards achieving these goals will be overshadowed by a host of other problems, some of them threatening the party's survival. China's successful rush to capitalism will demand ever greater freedom that the Communist leadership will be reluctant to give. 
China's leaders will be glad that their bid to host the 2000 Olympic Games in Beijing was narrowly defeated by Sydney. They can look forward now to a year unencumbered by major international events or sensitive anniversaries. They will be relieved to see the back of 1999a year in which they pulled out every stop to ensure social stability during a string of potentially troublesome dates, including the 10th anniversary in June of the crushing of the Tiananmen Square protests and the anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic. But the leadership cannot afford to relax. 
The end of 1999 will focus more attendon on a problem that has bedevilled the Communist Party for the past 50 years: the status of Taiwan. Following the return of the Portuguese-administered territory of Macao to Chinese rule on December 20th 1999, the entire Chinese mainland, for the first time since the Ming Dynasty, will be under the control of a single, indigenous government. In Beijing's view, Taiwan will thus become the last remaining holdout in China of an administration that professes no allegiance to the Communist Party. 2000 will be a year of crisis in relations between Beijing and Taipei. 
Storm clouds began to gather over the Taiwan Straits in July 1999 when President Lee Teng-hui of Taiwan declared that his island's relations with the mainland should be treated on a ""stateto-state"" basis, thereby brushing aside the longstanding etiquette whereby both sides would say there was but one China. President Lee will stand down in March 2000 at the end of his maximum two terms in office. Beijing will anxiously await the outcome of the resulting presidential election. 
China's handling of the Taiwan issue will have a considerable impact on the volatile relationship between Beijing and Washington. America's presidential election in November 2000 will aggravate tensions, as candidates vie to demonstrate their readiness to deal firmly with Chinese transgressions. President Bill Clinton himself has warned of the danger of a ""campaign-driven cold war with China"". 
Beijing too is heading for a period of heightened political uncertainty as the Communist Party prepares for leadership changes at its 16th Congress in 2002 and at the following year's annual session of the parliament, the National People's Congress, when Jiang Zemin will be constitutionally obliged to step down as head of state. The man to watch in 2000 will be Vice-President Hu Jintao, a colourless technocrat being groomed by Mr Jiang for the presidency. The question is whether Mr Hu will also take over Mr Jung's more crucial post as Communist Party chief, or whether the country is heading for another Deng Xiaoping-style gerontocracy with Mr Jiang-already 73-clinging on into his dotage. 
Anyone aspiring to take over from Mr Jiang as party general secretary would be a brave person indeed. The party is becoming an unruly body. The ""Three Stresses"" campaign to restore ideological, political and moral rectitude among party members will not stop the rot. The root cause of widespread corruption and ill-discipline within the party is that many of its members have little sense of where the leadership is taking them or what their future will be in a country undergoing rapid change. The coming year will inevitably see numerous new cases of top level wrongdoing coming to light. 
It would certainly take a leader of extraordinary vision to steer the country through its economic difficulties. In 1998 Zhu Rongji, the prime minister, called for the fortunes of loss-making state-owned enterprises to be turned around by 2000. Though dubbed China's ""economics tsar"" by his western admirers, Mr Zhu has made little obvious headway. In an effort to revive the economy, Mr Zhu might well try devaluing the currency, the yuan, sometime in 2000. But it is far from clear that this would revive consumer confidence and halt the crippling deflationary spiral that has beset the country since late 1997. 
But it may not be all gloom for China's leaders in 2000. One event that could boost morale is the launch of the country's first manned space vehicle. This would make it only the third country after Russia and the United States to put a person into space. The intended message to the outside world would be that for all its problems, China is a major power with the expertise to match the West in the century to come. 
James Miles: senior Chinese affairs analyst, BBC news.  1999 First the good news. The turmoil that has surrounded the Japanese government ever since disgruntled voters threw the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) out of office in 1993, after 38 years of unbroken rule, is finally coming to an end. The Japanese people still do not believe that the Liberal Democrats have abandoned their venal ways. But they prefer the probusiness conservatives-especially when it comes to sorting out the country's financial and economic woes-to the squabbling ideologues of the opposition. Above all, they prefer to see the LDP in power but kept firmly on a leash, forced to govern through a coalition. 
In the general election that must be held before October 2000, the Japanese people will renew the Lnr-led coalition's mandate for another four years. They may even grant the Liberal Democrats an increased majority in the 500-seat lower house of the Diet (parliament). But there is absolutely nothing that the ruling party can do about its shortage of seats in the upper house for at least two more years-and quite possibly for a further five years given the chamber's distorted demographics. For the foreseeable future, therefore, Japan will be run by a coalition of conservative forces-the LDP plus the hawkish Liberal Party and the Buddhist-backed New Komeito. 
Now for the even better news: 2000 will see Japan, if not quite its old self, at least economically back on its feet again. After suffering its worst recession in living memory-prolonged by the miscalculations of political leaders and compounded by bungling, foot-dragging and denial on the part of the country's once-lauded bureaucracy-Japan should experience real growth of 2% during 2000, with possibly as much as 3% in 2001. This turnaround in Japan's political and economic fortunes owes much to the most improbable of figures. When handed the job by party bigwigs in mid1998, Keizo Obuchi was expected to be no more than a stop-gap prime minister. Pundits gave the uncharismatic leader of the LDP's largest faction months in office at most, as he served out the tail-end of the premiership vacated by the over-ambitious Ryutaro Hashimoto. The Obuchi government currently enjoys one of the highest popularity ratings in ages. And for good reason. The economic turnaround is largely a consequence of actions taken early in the Obuchi government's first term to clean up the country's banking mess and pump liquidity into the parched economy. 
The first glimmer of recovery came between January and March 1999 when the economy surprised everyone by growing by 2%. One by one, embarrassed economists began to revise their gloomy forecasts upwards. Most still believe that Mr Obuchi is a bit optimistic in promising the people that the economy will grow by an annual 0.5% in the fiscal year that ends in March 2000. But the consensus now is that the prime minister will at least be able to claim to have arrested the decline and got the economy growing again. Rather than risk jeopardising the fragile recovery-and alienate voters who will be heading shortly for the voting booths-the Lnr voted last September to give Mr Obuchi a second term. 
A recovery there may be, but that does not mean an end to the pain. Having finally shattered the myth of lifetime employment, Japanese companies will push joblessness-higher nowadays in Japan than in America-to over 6% during 2000 as they slash payrolls and reengineer their businesses every bit as vigorously as American firms did a decade ago. 
Two entirely new factors will keep Japanese managers' feet to the fire in 2000. One is a coming change in bookkeeping. From April, Japanese firms will have to prepare their consolidated accounts according to international standards, forcing them to close loopholes which allowed them to hide losses from their investors and profits from the taxman. Proper consolidated accounting will also reveal the full horror of their pension nightmares. Even among Japan's most respected companies, unfunded pension liabilities are going to be taking large bites out of profits for many years to come. 
The second factor that will make corporate Japan mend its ways in 2000 is the wholly new attitude that has been forced on the banks by their own troubles. Gone are the days when the Ministry of Finance could protect Japanese banks from the worst of their follies by ensuring that even the most incompetent remained profitable. Instead of doling out loans blindly to all and sundry, Japanese banks will henceforth have to weigh up the risks involved in each loan, using alien yardsticks such as a company's return on assets, its corporate strategy, its product development and its market record as guides to its credit worthiness. And bank loans will be priced at internationally competitive rates. Starting in 2000, the cost of capital for Japanese business will go through the roof. The wave of business mergers that will follow could easily send unemployment soaring towards 10%. Fortunately, from 2000 onwards, the hardship will be mitigated by an economy that has begun to grow. 
Nicholas Valery: Tokyo bureau chief, The Economist.  1999 The race to succeed Lee Teng-hui as Taiwan's president will be lively. Taiwan has truly taken to democracy, to the embarrassment of many of its neighbours. The wooden but competent vice-president, Lien Chan, is the official candidate of the ruling Kuomintang in the March 2000 election. The charismatic former mayor of Taipei, Chen Shui-bian, is carrying the flag for the main opposition Democratic Progressive Party. Adding spice is the participation of a former provincial governor, James Soong, who, after falling out with Mr Lee, is standing as an independent. 
Mr Soong is the front-runner but faces a tough race, partly because of his mainlander background. China was angered by the Taiwan government's redefinition in July of cross-Strait links as ""state-to-state"". Any further rise in tensions between the two sides-- caused, say, by Chinese attempts to intimidate Taiwan militarily-would damage Mr Soong, Mr Lien, perceived as a safe pair of hands, would benefit from a rise in tensions with China, as would Mr Chen. Mr Lien will also benefit from the vast finances of the Kuomintang. 
Attempts by China to intimidate Taiwan would drag down economic growth and cause tremors on the stockmarket. In the absence of such distractions Taiwan's GnP, estimated to have grown by 5.5% in 1999, will surge forward again in 2000, fuelled by the exports and investment spending of the island's high-tech manufacturers. 
Look out for the start of Taiwan's state lottery. It will raise $3 billion a year, mostly for new pensions and health. One area of concern is the general government deficit, which was 3.3% of GDP. As a result of the devastating earthquake on September 21st the deficit is likely to rise in 2000. The deterioration will, however, be limited by the government's privatisation programme, when onethird of the largest state-owned enterprise, Chunghwa Telecom, is sold, raising $6 billion.  1999 To judge from the commotion going on, visitors to Okinawa could be forgiven for thinking that the Olympic Games were being staged there this summer. All the construction, preparation and disruption on Japan's most southerly island prefecture is actually for the three-day summit meeting between the leaders of the Group of Seven industrial countries plus Russia on July 21st-24th. To keep everyone cheerfully loquacious, local distillers of awamori-a rice-based spirit that has been produced in Okinawa for more than 500 years-have formulated a special brew to be served at official receptions. 
Public handouts have been a way of life for Okinawans since the end of the second world war. The chain of subtropical islands, 1,600km south-west of Tokyo> was governed by the American military until it was handed back in 1972. It has remained Japan's poorest and most heavily subsidised prefecture ever since. 
The one big stick locals have for beating the authorities in Tokyo is the fact that, despite accounting for no more than 1% of the Japanese land mass, Okinawa provides 75% of the facilities used by American forces in Japan and accommodates 29,000 of the 47,000 soldiers stationed in the archipelago. So whenever Okinawans feel they need something from the central government, they bring out the ""Yankee Go Home"" signs. It never fails. 
The chance to host the summit was part of a government bribe to get the local community to accept a new site for the huge Futenma helicopter station used by the American marines. No surprise then that it is to Nago-an hour or two's drive to the north-east of the prefectural capital of Naha and its airport-that the leaders of the industrial world will congregate for three days.  1999 One of the remarkable features of Japan in the 1970s and 1980s was that it seemed impervious to goings-on in the outside world. High dollar or low dollar, detente or evil empire, booming Asia or stumbling Asia, Japan just kept rolling on. The 1973 oil shock did knock it over for a year, but it clambered upright more quickly than any other developed economy. It did have to make appropriate foreign-policy noises at appropriate moments to please the Americans, but without any great effort. In 2000, however, it will be acutely vulnerable to events in the outside world. Its fate in the coming few years will depend, more than anything else, on what happens in three other countries: the United States, China and North Korea. 
The reason for this is more than just the banal reality of international interdependence. As the world's secondlargest economy and as Asia's most developed and richest country, you would expect Japan to have more control over its own fate than this. When, in the late 1980s, it looked destined soon to overtake America, it was widely assumed that political power-which, really, means the ability to influence events-would soon follow. It hasn't, because Japan's economy has stagnated for a decade. That stagnation has exposed the inability of any political party to take effective charge of domestic policy. Which, in turn, has left foreign policy dangling in the wind. 
The very thing that seemed to explain Japan's success-that politicians stayed out of the way of bureaucrats and businessmen-has in the 1990s prolonged its weakness. Businessmen became burdened with debts, and throttled by a collapsed financial system. Bureaucrats were discredited by corruption, and by their own initial attempts to lie about the financial crisis in the hope that it might soon mend itself. For once, politicians were needed, to make the hard choices that financial and economic restructuring required, and to restore control over the bureaucracy. By and large, however, they failed to rise to the occasion. 
That was why Japan was hit so hard by the East Asian financial crisis of 1997-98. At the time its economy was just struggling back to its feet, but without having had any proper financial restructuring. So this new blow, which would have bounced off the Japan of the 1970s or 1980s, toppled it back over. Its exports were hit, its banks' bad-debt burden increased, the nervousness of its consumers merely heightened. In 1999, its economy has again been struggling to its feet. But, again, there has not yet been any fundamental reform. So a new financial crisis, especially one sweeping across the Pacific from the United States, would knock it down again. 
Meanwhile, short of any clear political leadership, this rich but vulnerable country is living in an increasingly tense neighbourhood. China, Japan's traditional rival for regional leadership, is going to pass through some sort of economic and thus political crisis as the strains in its fairlyfree-market economy put pressure on its very-unfree communist dictatorship. That will mainly be a domestic affair. But it is bound to have repercussions for Taiwan, which is the cause celebre of Chinese nationalists, especially those in its armed forces. If so, that will affect us all but especially Japan, which has been Taiwan's strongest supporter in the region. 
A new nationalism 
Japanese politicians, particularly in the ruling Liberal Democratic Party, are quite hawkish about Taiwan. It is the one topic on which Japan's foreign policy could reasonably be called brave in recent years. Will they remain brave if, in the next few years, China steps up its rhetorical attacks on Taiwan, imposes a blockade or even invades? One cannot know in advance, but it looks quite likely. Domestic economic weakness may even make a hawkish response more probable. Japanese politicians have their idiosyncracies, but in one way, they are similar to their counterparts elsewhere: in the face of trouble at home, they are likely to be tempted by a unifying cause abroad. 
North Korea is the other possible such cause. Already, in 1999, the threat of North Korean missiles suddenly made it possible to break a long impasse over co-operation with the United States in developing and deploying (around 200710) a theatre missile defence shield. The North Koreans are past masters at using brinkmanship as a negotiating ploy. Japan's problem is that the Koreans, to make this ploy work, need to keep coming up with new threats. It is Japan that is the obvious target for such threats, be they from terrorism, or missile tests, or something new. 
The upshot of all this is an apparent paradox. Once-proud, independent Japan enters the 21st century in a vulnerable state, its fate worryingly in the hands of outside forces. The paradox is that this, at last, could well stir the politicians into life, offering them a unifying cause. 
That cause will be nationalism, and much of the Japanese public will be susceptible to it. Is that a scary prospect for the outside world? Nationalism is the sort of brew that can always boil over into something unpleasant. But in today's and tomorrow's Japan, that is unlikely. It is much likelier to be positive: finally waking Japan up to play its proper role as a regional power. 
Bill Emmott: editor, The Economist.  1999 Remember the books that predicted the dawning of an Asian century that would eclipse the western world? Pull them down again. One day it will happen. In another 25 years Asia will dominate more than half the world's economy. By then the financial crisis that began in 1997 will be seen as no more than a downward blip in a long period of sustained growth. Instead of the decade of gloom that many feared lay ahead, East Asia will be bouncing back in 2000. Some of the tigers will again roar. But the sound they will make will be different, and in many ways more frightening to westerners. 
The shocks to the financial and business environment over the past three years have been so enormous that the region's economies will not resume all of their old exuberant ways. Consumer spending will be the thing to watch. It accounts for more than half the region's economic activity. Increases in consumer spending will show that the recovery is sustainable. But the details will be important. Although some people will be splashing out on new Mercedes-Benzs and Gucci handbags, much of the growth in spending will come from more modest purchases that reflect an end to the belttightening. People will want to do up their homes, replace worn out domestic appliances and perhaps take an overseas holiday. These are mostly things put off for the past two years. 
So growth will be tempered and might top out in 2000. One of the most important factors is that many East Asians remain worried. Two generations have grown up only ever knowing their incomes grow. Now they have experienced declining standards of living, or even unemployment. This has come as a shock and, as Asia recovers, many will be cautious. They will not borrow so much money-especially in foreign currencies-or invest so haphazardly. Caution, the result of hard lessons, is not necessarily a bad thing in the short term. 
Of course some people will desperately cling to the worst features of Asian business: a lack of transparency with too much cronyism and corruption. This is why there are good reasons for caution. Many problems have been hidden. This is particularly so with bust banks and debt-laden companies that have not restructured or closed down. The cracks have simply been papered over in the hope that, as the good times return, the difficulties will not seem so large and may even fade away all together. Some banks and firms will be unable to keep up the pretence. Companies that have put their houses in order will provide increased competition and attract the most interest from local and foreign investors. This will put more pressure on problem firms, and some will fail in 2000. 
The tremors from the banking world will be particularly strong. Many banks are still sitting on frightening amounts of bad loans which, even in improving economic conditions, are never likely to be repaid. One reason for this is that the speed of the recovery has meant that tougher bankruptcy provisions planned by some governments have not been fully implemented. If companies cannot be easily wound up, their debts pile up and their assets cannot be put to use by others. Scandals, wrangling over who is to blame for past problems and political interference will also continue to take its toll on the Asian recovery. 
Meanwhile the chant of reformasi, the rallying cry of the Indonesian students that brought down President Suharto in May 1998, will echo around the region. Indonesia, the giant in SouthEast Asia with a population of 200m, will continue on the path to democracy under its new president, Abdurrahman Wahid. As East Timor struggles to become an independent nation, it will stir fears about a break-up of the sprawling archipelago. Politicians from some of Indonesia's neighbours, in particular the generals who run Myanmar, will try to present the problems facing Indonesia as evidence that only strong governments work in the region. This view will sit even more uneasily with a group of increasingly democratic and open governments led by South Korea, Taiwan, the Philippines and Thailand. 
None of these headwinds will be lost on Singapore, which proved to be one of the most resilient economies throughout the crisis. Although it is virtually a oneparty state, Singapore's leaders have well-tuned antennae. They will liberalise the island's economy even further and try to attract higher-value industries. At the same time, Singapore's leaders will allow the boundaries of personal freedom to be pushed wider than ever before. The reasons go beyond simply allowing Singaporeans to do more before they demand more: the government wants to encourage more entrepreneurial activity, but cannot orchestrate that without dismantling the nanny state. The lesson that Singapore can teach the rest of the region (and also China) is that capitalism has to be an honest system to work. A lack of corruption, transparent accounts, Anglo-American corporate governance-these are the things that will create wealth in Asia. 
Even where democracy has a firm hold people will demand a greater say in running their country. In South Korea, one of the leaders in reform, there will be pressure on the president, Kim Dae Jung, to deliver more accountable government. Mr Kim will have his hands busy battling to reform the chaebol, the conglomerates that have increased their grip on the nation's economy during the financial crisis. 
The one thing that was always true about East Asia will be more true than ever: it is a region of very different economies and policies. This will become more apparent in 2000. Those who have reformed the most will do best. 
Paul Markillie: Asia editor, The Economist.  1999 India enters its 50th anniversary as a republic in high spirits. Its people take pride in having humbled Pakistan in Kashmir, in the stunning success of Indian businessmen overseas, in recent breakthroughs in literacy and population growth, in respectable though not tigerish economic growth and in the slow sloughing off of socialist regulation. Yet they will rightly moan about worsening governance, growing corruption and crime, and shortages of basics like water and electricity. 
The jingoism generated by the confrontation in Kashmir, which flared after Pakistani-backed separatists crossed the ""line of control"" into Indian territory and occupied heights near the towns of Kargil, will resonate in 2000, and keep the subcontinent an area of tension. Expect defence spending to rise officially from 2.5% of crrr in 1999 to 3.0% in 2000 (3.5% if you include some secret purchases). Kargil exhausted much of India's stock of artillery shells, and showed how difficult it was to throw back even a modest number of infiltrators. So India's venal politicians will strike big new arms deals, combining patriotic fervour with lucrative kickbacks. 
Expect the Indian film industry, the biggest in the world, to churn out several movies depicting heroic Indian soldiers thrashing slimy Pakistanis. Expect Pakistan to produce its own movies depicting courageous Kashmiri freedom fighters being gunned down by slimy Indians. Expect the two countries to jam one another's satellite broadcasts of these propaganda efforts. 
According to some official estimates, the billionth Indian was born in 1999. But most demographers believe the event will take place only in 2000, thanks to India's success in slowing population growth over the past generation. Contraception has reduced the birth rate from 48 per 1,000 50 years ago to 27 per 1,000 now, but improved health care has simultaneously reduced the death rate just as rapidly, so for decades the population kept growing at 2.0% per year. However, the death rate is levelling off while the birth rate continues to fall. So population growth is now down to 1.6% annually, and could fall to 1.0% by 2010. 
Expect continuing improvement in literacy too. In 1991, adult literacy was only 52%, well below the level in many African countries. But new political awareness of the importance of primary education has helped the literacy rate to shoot up to nearer 64%. Both the urbanrural gap and male-female literacy gap have shrunk faster than the national average. Education will become a hot political topic in coming years, now that the information revolution is reaching villages through the extension of telecoms and the Internet. 
With the 50th anniversary of India's birth as a republic on January 26th, there will be many long speeches on the country's success in staying democratic in the face of huge strains. Yet critics will say this deserves maybe two cheers but not three. Fifty years ago politicians were viewed as heroes who had won India independence. Today they are viewed as corrupt and criminal. Expect researchers to celebrate the anniversary with fresh data on the number of criminals in the country's many legislatures. (The last estimate, made two years ago by a member of the Election Commission, put the number of criminals at 40 in Parliament and 700 in the state legislatures.) The judicial system is so slow and the police system so incompetent that not a single politician has been convicted of corruption through all stages of appeal. A former prime minister, Narasimha Rao, is still defending a case of alleged cheating in 1984: the complainant has already died of old age. 
When India became a republic, politicians declared that Indians could at last succeed in ways that were impossible under white rule. But today Indians are achieving stunning success not at home, but abroad. Ron Dutta has become head of the world's biggest airline, United Airlines, and Rakesh Gangwal is boss of us Air. Sabeer Bhatia invented Hotmail, the most popular form of Internet based email, and sold it for $400m to Microsoft. Silicon Valley overflows with Indian entrepreneur millionaires. None of these gentlemen would have fared anywhere near as well in India, where talent does not take you far. Fifty years after becoming a republic, Indians are faring better in countries ruled by whites than in their own. Expect politicians to do absolutely nothing about it. 
Swaminathan S. Anklesaria Aiyar: consulting editor of the Economic Times, India.  1999 It will be another tense year. The ruling military junta has promised to hold an election once a new constitution is finished, but progress will remain painfully slow. In the meantime, the junta will continue its efforts to smash the main opposition party, the National League for Democracy (NLD). Tensions will be particularly high in late May, the tenth anniversary of the NLD's 1990 election victory-a result that the military rulers never implemented. Opposition, which comes not just from the NLD but from student, religious and ethnic groups as well, could turn violent. 
But the junta should retain control. It has a vast military and intelligence network, backed by its political wing, the Union Solidarity Development Association. It is unclear how much real support the junta enjoys even within these groups. However, its oppressive tactics have resulted in what the leader of the NLn, Aung San Suu Kyi, has termed a ""blanket of fear"" settling over the country. 
Desperate to break the deadlock, foreign governments will repeat their calls for dialogue between the junta and the opposition. American sanctions will be up for renewal once again in May 2000, and there is also the possibility that the multilateral institutions will again offer to release aid in exchange for steps towards political reform. If the junta grasps the nettle, Myanmar's economic prospects will improve considerably. 
But a change of heart is unlikely. In the absence of reform, efforts to boost agricultural output will be hampered by a shortage of fuel, pesticides and fertiliser, while a dearth of foreign investment will hurt industrial output. The free-market exchange rate will depreciate further. 
Myanmar is a country that, like Cuba and North Korea, has turned its back on the world. As a result it will be 2000's most needlessly miserable country.  1999 When the Queen of England visits Australia in March, she will find that the ex-- colony's recent vote to keep her on as head of state, and not to declare a republic, has left the nation republican in spirit but monarchist in form. The failed vote for a republic was the result of political division (extraordinarily, Prime Minister John Howard advocated a ""no"" vote) and a high level of public disdain for politicians, rather than enthusiasm for the British monarchy. It leaves Australia with a 19th-century constitution. The big debate for the future will be whether, when the matter eventually comes back on to the agenda, Australians should be considering a much more radical model in which the public would directly elect the head of state. 
This political matter aside-and many Australians clearly do dismiss it as mere politics-Australia is in a confident mood. The economy is strong, its recent reforms have cleared the decks for a prosperous few years as Asia's economies recover. And the advent of the Olympic games gives most Australians the feeling that anything the world can do, they can do as well, if not better. 
The general mood of confidence has its shadows, and these come mostly from abroad. The chaos of nearby Indonesia and the Australian intervention in East Timor have caused immediate concern to Mr Howard. Suddenly defence policy, on which spending had fallen to well below 2% of GDP, has become an issue. A bigger defence spend will mean less money for other priorities if the coalition wants to preserve the healthy budget surpluses that have been the pride of the government, elected in 1996. 
Australia's relationship with Indonesia, the cornerstone for decades of foreign policy, has deteriorated sharply, as both the government and the Labor opposition elevated East Timor from the bottom to the top of their international priorities. Bipartisan pragmatism had dominated relations with Indonesia; suddenly policy is getting a ""moral"" base. This new foreign policy will be dramatically and possibly dangerously tested if the fears of the pessimists are realised and Indonesia starts to break up, with parts such as Irian Jaya pressing for their independence. 
Australia enters the next century economically prosperous and confident. Despite dire predictions, it survived the Asian economic crisis with scarcely a scar. Economic restructuring in the 1980s and early 1990s-financial-sector reform, reducing tariffs and privatisation-will stand the country in good stead for 2000 and beyond. It is now inclined to lecture the Asia region on economic and financial rectitude. Growth continues to be strong; unemployment remains around 7%: only a few years ago it was 11%. 
In mid-2000 a new goods and services tax will begin operating. If the government wins the 2001 election it will have made dramatic tax history, having won an election (1998) on the promise of a new tax and then survived to tell the tale of implementing one. Now decisions are being made on a major overhaul of the business tax system-including reducing capital-gains tax and the company tax rate-to attract extra international capital, especially venture funds. 
There is a mood of optimism in the nation. Sydney's 2000 Olympic Games and the 2001 centenary of the six states joining in a federation will make for two years of world attention and local partying. The only other time Australia hosted the games was the 1956 Melbourne Olympics. Then, too, Australia was on a high, enjoying post-war prosperity and building a booming economy on a wave of migration. Now migration is at a low level, but Australia has become a truly multicultural nation, with the ""White Australia"" policy long abandoned, and with Sydney and Melbourne having large Asian communities. 
The raucous and racist One Nation Party, which signified the deep discontent of regional Australia in 1998, will have faded to a minor group by 2000. But the rural areas still feel squeezed and politically alienated, as population and services have drained away from the bush. Primary production, traditionally a big slice of Australia's wealth (especially export wealth) has become riskier. Australia has a touch of the two classes about it, based on geography. 
And on race. The plight of many Aborigines is the national shame, with blacks having high levels of infant mortality and shorter longevity than the general population. Too many Aborigines live on welfare. There are some bright spots: the increasing number of Aboriginal graduates; the election of Aden Ridgeway, an Aboriginal senator; and at the games, the nation's heart will be with Aboriginal athlete Cathy Freeman. 
Michelle Grattan: chief political correspondent, Sydney Morning Herald.  1999 After the corruption scandal that surrounded Salt Lake City's bid for the 2002 Winter Olympics, the Olympic movement can count itself lucky that the sports-mad Australians will do everything in their power to ensure that the Sydney 2000 Olympic Games (September 15th-October 1st) will be a success. One million Australians have already bought tickets. They can expect the 2000 Games to be a superbly organised, highly photogenic event, which will draw a worldwide television audience of 3.5 billion. 
By Olympic standards, the completion of Stadium Australia in the Sydney suburb of Homebush, over a year before the opening ceremony, was unprecedented. Once the Olympic flame finally gets to Sydney after its travels around the Pacific region, the stadium will be packed to its 110,000 capacity. In Atlanta 1996, the gold medal count was, United States: 101, Germany: 65, Russia: 63, China: 50, Australia: 41. As hosts, Australia will again excel, conforming to the formula for home success that is one part inspiration, two parts state injection of finances into sport. Australia is the most successful sporting nation in the world, if you measure its results against its 19m population. Sydney 2000 will act as the stage for established stars such as the women's 400m gold prospect Cathy Freeman and newcomers like the 16year-old wonderboy Ian Thorpe, who has a chance of three swimming medals. Watch out for the triathlon, though the swimming leg may be less exciting now that the authorities have guaranteed that there are no sharks in Sydney Harbour. 
Expect stirring performances from the Greeks where athletics has improved greatly since they won the Olympic bid for Athens in 2004. In the javelin, Mirela Manjani-Tzelili and Kostas Gatsioudis are stars in the making. Conversely, China has scaled down its athletic efforts since its rejection as host for 2000, but should at least achieve one ""track"" gold in the 50km walk. 
American sprinters and African distance runners will provide the classic excitement. The United States sprint trio of Michael Johnson, Maurice Greene and Marion Jones in five events (100m, 200m, long jump, and the 100m and 400m relays) will peak in Sydney. Ms Jones intends to go for a record five to better Karl Lewis's record of four sprint golds at Los Angeles 1984. She has already endeared herself to crowds everywhere and will be the face of the games. 
In the men's middle and distance events, the North and East Africans will carve up the medals between them. Classy Kenyan runners are plentiful and would win any long-distance relay race, but don't bet against the constantly improving Hicham El Gurrouj of Morocco in the 1,500m and the peerless Ethiopian Haile Gebrselassie in the 10,000m. For students of Olympic history, however, the place to be is at the rowing regatta, where the British oarsman Steve Redgrave, this time in the coxless fours, will be vying for his fifth gold medal in consecutive games, an unmatched achievement in any Olympic sport. 
Sydney's best advertisement is in the number of athletes who will decide to seek residence in the country. Already, four young Romanian wrestlers in Sydney for an Olympic test event have claimed asylum. Olympic officials say they are powerless to prevent athletes from trying to stay in Australia: ""The security fence at the Olympic Village is to keep people outnot to keep athletes in."" 
Matthew Glendinning: freelance sports and business writer.  1999 The Middle East enters the new century with the mould of the past generation cracking, if not yet breaking. Long years of Arab-Israeli conflict, involving five major wars since the foundation of the state of Israel in 1948, may now be drawing to an end, following the election in Israel of Ehud Barak and the relaunch of the regional peace process. A generation of Arab rulers-autocrats to a man even if their despotism has occasionally been benign-has started giving way to a new one, more susceptible to change and less burdened by the failures of their fathers. 
So why is there so little optimism to be found in the region? Mainly because no Arab country has lost its fear of, and innate hostility towards, Israel. This includes Egypt and Jordan, which have peace treaties with the Jewish state that emerged in their midst just over half a century ago. Paradoxically, only among the Palestinians-the people with most reason to resent Israel-can one find significant numbers of people who react with equanimity towards the Israelis. But Israelis themselves are in the main still deeply suspicious of Arabs in general and their Palestinian neighbours in particular. 
All this will be held mercilessly under the spotlight in the coming year. During that time, Israel and the Palestine Liberation Organisation (PLO) have undertaken to reach a ""final status"" treaty. Mr Barak also aims to reach peace with Syria by withdrawing from the Golan Heights-captured in the 1967 Arab-Israeli war and held against fierce counterattack in the 1973 war-and thereby allow Israeli troops to pull out of south Lebanon, where Israel has been trying to hold a buffer since 1978. 
Mr Barak, a former army chief-of-- staff at the head of a revamped Labour-- led alliance, plays the role of the thinking man's thug-tough on security, but thoughtful about the causes of Israel's insecurity. He believes, for instance, that Israel is weakened by its continuing occupation of Arab land. 
However, he did oppose the 1995 Oslo agreement on interim autonomy for the Palestinians; he is no peacenik. The PLO wants all of the West Bank and the Gaza strip-only 22% of Mandate Palestine-for an independent Palestinian state with occupied Arab east Jerusalem as its capital. Mr Barak has signalled he intends to hand over about 60% of the West Bank-little more than a tenth of historic Palestine. He has declared that none of Arab Jerusalem will be handed back, and no Palestinian refugees-3.6m registered by the urr in the occupied territories, Jordan, Syria and Lebanon, and 4.5m worldwide-can return. 
Scepticism about an enduring settlement with the Palestinians-- the heart of the Arab-Israeli conflict-is therefore amply justified. Doubly so, when the Syria-- Lebanon ""track"" of the peace process is likely to overtake the Palestinian ""track"". Negotiations with Damascus and its client in Beirut are essentially about security; Israel has no ideological claims on the Golan and south Lebanon, whereas religious Jews regard the West Bank as part of the Land of Israel given to them by God. Once the deal is done with the Syrian president, Hafez Assad, Yasser Arafat and his PLo will be isolated. Except in one explosive respect: the truly millennial issue of Jerusalem. 
Mr Barak wants this off the negotiating table, as though Arabs and Muslims could acquiesce in Israel's continuing occupation of the third holiest site in Islam, the Haram ash-Sharif in the Old City, with the Dome of the Rock and the ancient al-Aqsa mosque, a stone's throw from the Wailing Wall. Mr Arafat, great survivor though he is, could not give away Jerusalem-nor could any Arab or Muslim leader. 
Israel's initial plan was to make three Arab monarchs custodians of the holy sites, while retaining sovereignty: King Hussein of Jordan and King Hassan of Morocco, both of whom claimed descent from the Prophet Mohammed, and King Fahd of Saudi Arabia, protector of the holy cities of Mecca and Medina. King Hussein and King Hassan died in 1999, while King Fahd like many of his Arab peers is seriously ill. There was, in any event, no indication that the three would have co-operated. To have done so would have undermined their legitimacy. 
Legitimacy is, in any case, in short supply, highlighted by Arab leaders' seeming need to reassure themselves with 90-99% majorities in spurious plebiscites in countries that include Syria, Iraq, Egypt, Tunisia and Yemen. Republican regimes in the region, paradoxically, appear to have worse dynastic problems than the absolute monarchies most of them replaced. The successions in Jordan, Morocco and Bahrain, and the incipient succession in Saudi Arabia, appear to be going fairly smoothly. By contrast, there are doubts about who will succeed the republican masters of Syria and Iraq. President Assad appears to be grooming his young and untried son, Bashar. Saddam Hussein has long given free rein to his murderous and racketeering sons, Uday and Qusay. Even if there were a peace settlement with Israel, these problems of legitimacy in the Arab world would remain. 
David Gardner: Middle East editor For the Financial Times.  1999 With the aged King Fahd so obviously ill and incapacitated, the transfer of power to the elderly, but less frail, Crown Prince Abdullah will be eagerly watched. He will take over a kingdom not yet in crisis but facing serious economic and social problems that oil earnings-greatly reduced from a decade ago-can no longer disguise. He will need to respond to the discontent of a generation of young people which has grown up amid oil wealth and for which the prospect of unemployment or low-paid work comes as a shock. The Kingdom's young will grow steadily more vocal. 
But those hoping for bold reforms will be disappointed. Fear of popular anger will ensure that the authorities delay the reforms needed to place the economy and state finances on a sustainable footing, and reduce the kingdom's overwhelming dependence on oil. The strength of oil prices in 2000 will provide some, albeit temporary, financial leeway, curbing the current-account deficit and boosting growth. Rather than liberalising the economy and wooing foreign investment, the government will concentrate on mobilising private Saudi capital to invest in new projects. 
Such caution will stem from the royal family's concern that cuts in state welfare could prompt disaffected Saudis to rally behind calls for a brand of Islamist nationalism that blames the country's ills on its political system. This potential will be accentuated by Saudi's increasing access to information on the Internet, and to the controversial talk shows broadcast by Qatar's uncensored Al-Jazeera satellite television channel. On this channel contentious issues, such as the foreign military presence and the state of the economy, get freely aired. The social liberalisation that is so apparent in the Gulf states will put serious pressure on the kingdom's moral rectitude. Yesterday's threat was Islamic extremism, tomorrow's will be a burgeoning young population that wants western-style reforms.  1999 For much of Latin America it will be a year of economic recovery. Growth for the region as a whole should reach 3-4%. This marks an improvement on 1999's sharp recession, which saw output fall by perhaps 1%, the worst performance in a decade. In South America, recovery will be steady rather than swift. Mexico escaped the recession because of its links with the United States' economy, but that in turn makes it vulnerable to any sharp slowdown north of the border. 
The region's economic performance will not be strong enough to sweep away the creeping political disillusion with market economics. But neither will the broad liberal reforms of the past decade be abandoned wholesale: some, such as privatisation, will continue, as will (Venezuela perhaps excepted) openness to foreign trade and investment. And as fiscal constraints ease somewhat, governments will pay more attention to social spending. 
The pace of recovery depends partly on outside factors, such as renewed growth in Europe and Asia offsetting a slowdown in the United States, and thus helping to boost prices for Latin America's commodity exports. Any sharp rise in American interest rates would hurt South America, too. But the key to recovery lies with Brazil (which accounts for two-fifths of Latin American cnr). President Fernando Henrique Cardoso faces the challenge of holding his fractious coalition together despite his own deep unpopularity (prompted by the January 1999 devaluation) and the distraction of October's municipal elections. 
That means the government will make little progress with structural reform in taxes, pensions and public finances. But a strong rival to Mr Cardoso is unlikely to emerge. Instead, Brazil will muddle through (as it has done for much of the 500 years since the Portuguese arrived there, an anniversary it will commemorate in April). The government should manage to keep reasonably tight control over public spending. That, together with improvised revenue-raising measures, will allow it to meet, more or less, the fiscal targets agreed with the iMF, and its own target of 4% growth, helped by an increase, at last, in exports, as they respond to devaluation. 
Recovery in Brazil will help its neighbours in the Mercosur trade block. Presidential elections in Argentina, Chile and Uruguay in the final months of 1999 were likely to usher in presidents of the centre-left in each country. Of the three, Argentina's Fernando de la Rua, a cautious radical, inherits the trickiest challenge. Argentina's rigid exchange-rate peg to the dollar was the cause of its rollercoaster economic progress during the 1990s under Carlos Menem. But if the arrangement is to survive (Brazil and Chile abandoned their less rigid currency pegs during 1999), Mr de la Rua will have to move quickly to lower business costs through fiscal, labour and anti-monopoly reforms. For these, he will need Mr Menem's support, since he will lack a congressional majority. Even if he fails, a weaker dollar might still let Argentina off its self-imposed hook. Otherwise it will face an unpalatable choice: adopting the dollar outright, or a devaluation that would be more traumatic than Brazil's. Each would constrain growth. 
The main threat to Latin American democracy will remain in the northern Andes. Colombia's civil wars will escalate. The army's new anti-drugs battalion, trained and financed by the United States, will enter combat against the leftwing guerrillas (but not the right-wing paramilitaries, even though both groups have links with the drug trade). America will pump money and, perhaps, military advisers, into helping President Andres Pastrana's government, but will not send in its own troops. The guerrillas may respond by using missiles against government aircraft. Peace talks will not be formally broken off, but will get nowhere. Slowly the guerrillas will start losing the war. 
In Venezuela, President Hugo Chavez will win a referendum approving his new constitution, and go on to get himself reelected in a fresh presidential election, in the sixth national vote in 18 months. Higher oil prices mean the economy may temporarily recover, prolonging Mr Chavez's popularity. But his regime will be marked by populist gestures and creeping militarism. In Ecuador, general political chaos could see President Jamil Mahuad not only unable to nail down the iMF's support but overthrown by Congress, with a subsequent search for a strongman in the Chavez mould. Yet even so, constitutional appearances would probably be preserved. That is the fashion pioneered by another elected authoritarian, Peru's Alberto Fujimori, who since 1990 has successfully reformed his country's economy in a way Mr Chavez seems unlikely to do. Having brushed off legal objections to his candidacy, Mr Fujimori will try for a third term as president in April. Renewed economic growth, his government's influence over the media and the opposition's weakness ought to guarantee Mr Fujimori victory. But Peruvian voters, often unpredictable, may suddenly decide they have tired of him, and turn to Luis Castaneda Lossio, a canny centrist. 
In Cuba, Fidel Castro does not allow such uncertainties. His dictatorship will survive yet another year. The United States will relax its 40-year trade embargo against Cuba, allowing food and medicine sales into the country. But do not expect any liberalising gestures from Mr Castro in return. 
Michael Reid: Americas editor, The Economist.  1999 Chile's reborn democracy is limbering up for its tenth birthday in March 2000, battered and bruised from hefty blows in the previous two years. The extradition proceedings against General Augusto Pinochet, a former dictator, have reopened old political wounds. And the economy is still suffering from the effects of the emerging markets' crisis and the adverse weather that accompanied El Nino. In an attempt to revive output and employment, the government has allowed the fiscal accounts to slip into the red for the first time in 13 years. 
There is work to be done if Chile is to shake off its recent grogginess. The new government, which takes office in March, following an election in December, will have little time to enjoy the anniversary celebrations. Continued co-operation between the right and left will be crucial to maintain the consensus which has formed the cornerstone of Chile's economic success during the 1990s. Whatever the outcome of the Pinochet extradition saga, complete national reconciliation will be achieved only once the past is revisited without fear of recrimination. 
On the economic front, the first set of challenges for the new government appears straightforward. Given an improving external environment, relaxed monetary conditions and a low basis of comparison, GDr growth could reach 5% in 2000, while moderate import prices and spare capacity will restrain inflation. 
But to convince investors that it has truly returned to winning ways, Chile will need to overcome two stronger challenges: rebalancing the fiscal accounts; and restraining consumption to keep the currentaccount deficit at a sustainable level over the medium term. Success in both these areas would pave the way in 2000 for faster growth and development, and confirm Chile's (unofficial) status as Latin America's top-rank performer.  1999 Africa will amble through 2000 with an uneven gait. Its athletes will sweep up plenty of medals at the Olympic Games, again showing their world calibre. African footballers will score many goals in the Euro 2000 football championship. But many African economies will barely hobble past the starting line, compared with their competitors in Asia and Latin America. The brave hopes for an African economic revival have foundered as several regions' conflicts-in Ethiopia-Eritrea, Sudan, the giant Democratic Republic of Congo and Angola-have drawn in many of their neighbours. 
A tough triumvirate of African leaders will try to end the chaos. South Africa's Thabo Mbeki, Nigeria's Olusegun Obasanjo and Algeria's Abdelaziz Bouteflika will cajole Africa's warring states into negotiations and peace deals. They will dominate Africa's continental club, the Organisation of African Unity (oAU). With their good political and diplomatic track-records, the three will be taken seriously in Africa and in the West. 
Their priority in 2000 is to consolidate a tentative peace in Congo. Closely related to this is the need to put new pressure on Jose dos Santos's government and Jonas Savimbi's UNITa rebels to end the latest round of Angola's 25year civil war. But progress here requires them to convince the uN Security Council to send international troops to Angola alongside local African peacekeepers. Angola and Congo will be the weariest of the world's warring states by 2000, and therein lies hope. 
Apart from diplomacy, Mr Bouteflika and Mr Obasanjo will be busy at home. Both are veterans of their countries' Byzantine politics; both returned to power in 1999, inheriting deeply fractured societies and weakened states. Algeria and Nigeria have enough gas and oil to finance much of their own economic recovery and to bring in foreign capital for the rest. They will be helped by the upswing in oil prices. Along with South Africa, they will be the key countries to watch for signs of any genuine African revival. 
Another prominent African, the urr secretary-general, Kofi Annan, will spend much of 2000 thinking about his troubled continent. The scheduled referendum on Western Sahara's independence in July will be a major test. Can the urr prevent a re-run of East Timor in North Africa? Certainly Morocco's new King Mohammed VI is no more eager to countenance losing the referendum than was Indonesia's General Wiranto in East Timor. The most likely outcome in Western Sahara is, therefore, continued Moroccan obstructionism. Perhaps the Libyan leader, Colonel Muammar Gadaffi, who talks to both Morocco and the pro-independence Polisario Front, will offer to mediate. Either way, expect to hear plenty about Western Sahara in 2000. It will be on every foreign editor's list. 
Egypt, Africa's fourth heavyweight, will grow at some 5% and its stockmarket even faster. A parliamentary election must be held in Egypt by November 2000. But do not expect much change as a result. To little surprise, President Hosni Mubarak was elected to a fourth six-year term by a familiar huge majority in September 1999. Exuding a pharaonic interest in the rest of Africa, President Mubarak will host a grand Europe-Africa summit in Cairo in April which promises to go beyond the usual pious hopes. Britain and France will make much of their new entente cordiale in Africa. 
Mr Mubarak is also keeping a close watch on Sudan and Somalia. Much as he distrusts the Islamist regime in Khartoum, which backed an attempt to kill him in 1995, Mr Mubarak does not want to see it forced to concede an independent Southern Sudan. That would challenge Cairo's control of the Nile. But the Khartoum regime will face a new wave of regional and international pressure to end its war with the south that has claimed more than 2m lives in 30 years. In Somalia, there will be almost no outside pressure, except from regional predators such as Egypt and Ethiopia. The rest of the world is still faintly embarrassed by the failure of the multi-billion-dollar efforts to intervene in the country. Somalia will show the world one thing in 2000: that it is quite possible to have a nation without any semblance of a government to run it. Across the continent, Charles Taylor's regime in Liberia is also a proponent of small government and big militias. Mr Taylor and his ally Blaise Compaore of Burkina Faso will show that gangster politics is still pervasive in Africa. 
Democracy spreads 
A trio of more constitutionally minded governments along West Africa's coast-Cote d'Ivoire, Ghana and Senegal-face elections in 2000. Incumbents Henri Konan-Bedie and Abdou Diouf are odds-on favourites to win in Cote d'Ivoire and Senegal. Ghana's poll is harder to read. Jerry Rawlings, an ex-military leader and elected president, may confound the sceptics and step down after his statutory two terms. If he does such an unAfrican thing, he will set an example to the continent and his well-resourced National Democratic Congress Party should win. 
Successions will also dominate politics in Kenya and Zimbabwe where presidents Daniel arap Moi and Robert Mugabe must leave by 2002. Neither leader seems inclined to go. Neither has yet indicated successors. Both have aged badly. For the first time since independence in 1980, Mr Mugabe will face a serious opposition party, the Movement for Democratic Change, in parliamentary elections in mid2000. Most hopefully, both countries have a bright new generation of African entrepreneurs-working in information technology and telecommunicadons-who are launching companies on western stock exchanges. 
Both Tanzania and Namibia are on the up. They go to the polls in 2000 and will probably re-elect the incumbent parties of presidents Benjamin Mkapa and Sam Nujoma (even though Mr Nujoma had to change his country's liberal constitution to squeeze in a third term for himself). Promised elections in GuineaBissau are more problematic. The regime came to power after a coup. But elections in nearby Niger, which has a similar history, passed off in 1999 without trouble. 
Africa's coup-makers will find life tougher in 2000. Under Algerian President Bouteflika's chairmanship, the onu is to expel all regimes which come to power through force of arms, discreetly casting a veil over the political history of most of the continent's governments. 
Patrick Smith: editor, Africa Confidential.  1999 On July 2nd Mexico will hold a presidential election that will be the most hotly contested-and fairest-in its history. For the past 70 years, under the rule of the Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI), power has changed hands through backroom deals; before that, it was often by the passage of arms. Now, the voters will be the arbiters. And they will probably choose to keep the PRi in power for another six years. 
Such an outcome is far from automatic. Thanks to the setting up of an independent electoral authority, and Mexico's slow but steady democratisation, the opposition has its bestever chance of winning. But the opposition is divided, between the socially conservative freemarketeers of the National Action Party (rAN) and the left-of-centre Party of the Democratic Revolution (PRD). Efforts to unite them behind a single candidate will fail. 
Even without an opposition coalition, the PAN's Vicente Fox, a charismatic campaigner and former manager for Coca-Cola, could still mount a powerful challenge. Even so, provided the ruling party avoids splits, a narrow PRI victory is the likeliest outcome, not least because the party's influence over the media and its scope for making handouts to poorer voters still give it a residual advantage. 
But assuming it does win, which Par will it be? Certainly not the party of old, in which the outgoing president named his successor, whose victory was then assured. In November 1999, the PRi chose its candidate in its first-ever open primary election. 
The intense power battle within the rai could spark violence (as in 1994, when its presidential candidate and general-secretary were both murdered). The election will strain the stability of Mexico's still-evolving democracy and market economy. The defences look stronger than in 1994 (when for the fifth time in a row, presidential succession was accompanied by devaluation), but talk of Mexico gaining an investment-grade credit rating sounds premature until the next presidency is well settled. 
The economy will be hurt by any slowdown in the United States. It could still be badly shaken by political turmoil. But for all these caveats, Mexico in 2000 will start to look (not before time) like a modern, democratic country, driven by a powerful (and even fairly free) economy. In a country whose capacity for cruelty and chaos is greater than most, there is every reason to believe that 2000 will be a cathartic year of change. 
Students of Mexico quickly learn to enjoy paradox. There will be plenty about. A party that was often hated when it ruthlessly clung to power may now be popularly and freely returned to office. Mr Zedillo, who came to office as a colourless technocrat by the chance of a bullet, will have delivered far more radical reform than his macho predecessors. And a country that for many years relied on a folkloric hatred of America for its social cohesion will discover that it has surreptitiously learnt the gringo's tricks of capitalism and democracy, to its own considerable advantage. 
Whoever he may be, Mexico's next president will be weaker than his predecessors, forced to deal (as Mr Zedillo has been for the second half of his mandate) with a Congress in which no party has a majority. He will have to grapple, too, with intractable social inequalities. 
After a decade of warmth, Mexico's relations with the United States could become decidedly cooler, if economic problems north of the border were to spill over into trade disputes, adding to the rising tensions over the illegal drug trade. But NAFTa will survive. Indeed, it is steadily changing Mexico in ways that are already bordering on irreversible.  1999 As with human health, so with national conflict: prevention is better and cheaper than intervention, argues Kofi Annan, secretary-general of the United Nations. 
In the past 20 years we have understood the need for military intervention where governments grossly violate human rights and the international order. In the next 20 years we must learn how to prevent conflicts as well as how to intervene in them. Even the costliest policy of prevention is far cheaper, in lives and in resources, than the least expensive intervention. 
This is why we have been pressing the international community to take prevention more seriously. In cost-benefit terms the case for doing this is compelling. A recent study by the Carnegie Commission on Preventing Deadly Conflict estimated that the cost to the international community of the seven major wars in the 1990s, not including Kosovo and East Timor, was $199 billion. Add in these two conflicts and $230 billion seems a likely figure. 
Effective prevention could have saved most of this huge sum. More important, it could have saved hundreds of thousands of lives. 
Time and again, differences are allowed to develop into disputes and disputes allowed to develop into deadly conflicts. Time and again, warning signs are ignored and pleas for help overlooked. Only after the deaths and the destruction do we intervene at a far higher human and material cost, by which time there are fewer lives left to save. Only when it is too late, it seems, do we value prevention. 
There are, in my view, three main reasons for the failure of prevention when prevention so clearly is possible. First, the reluctance of one or more of the parties to a conflict to accept external intervention of any kind. Second, the lack of political will at the highest levels of the international community. Third, a lack of integrated conflict-prevention strategies within the uN system and the international community. Of all these, the will to act is the most important. Without the political will to act when action is needed, no amount of improved coordination or early warning will translate awareness into action. 
The founders of the uN drew up its charter with a sober view of human nature. They had witnessed the ability of humanity to wage a war of unparalleled brutality and unprecedented cruelty. They had witnessed, above all, the failure of prevention, when prevention was, throughout the 1930s, still possible and every signal pointed to war. 
Of course, as realists we must also recognise that in some cases the sheer intractability of conflicts and the obduracy of the warring parties will make intervention unlikely to succeed. But even wars that cannot be stopped once started might well have been avoided with effective preventive policies. 
We are under no illusion that preventive strategies will be easy to implement. For a start, the costs of prevention have to be paid in the present, while its benefits lie in the distant future. And the benefits are not tangible-when prevention succeeds, nothing happens. Taking such a political risk when there are few obvious rewards requires conviction and considerable vision. 
Second, there are real institutional barriers to the institutional co-operation that prevention requires. In national governments and international agencies, departments responsible for security tend to know little about development or governance; those responsible for the latter rarely think of them in security terms. Identifying such constraints is not a counsel of despair. It is a necessary, if not sufficient, condition for progress. 
The UN has long argued that good governance, democratisation, respect for human rights and policies for equitable and sustainable development are the best form of long-term conflict prevention. The changing patterns of global conflict and governance in recent years, particularly with respect to democratisation, provide ample evidence to support our conviction. 
More votes, less war 
During the 1990s there has been a remarkable and little-noticed reduction in global warfare. More old wars have ended than new ones begun. Between 1989 and 1992 on average eight new ethnic wars began each year; today the average is two a year. Between 1992 and 1998 the scope and intensity of armed conflict around the world declined by about a third. The number of democratically elected governments increased by about the same proportion. 
We cannot leap to the conclusion that the increase in the number of democracies has caused the decrease in warfare. Other factors, such as the end of the cold war, surely also played a role (although the two are obviously related). 
But the evidence is in line with the well-established, if little publicised, finding that democracies have far lower levels of internal violence than nondemocracies. This is not really surprising. The non-violent management of conflict is the very essence of democracy. In an era when more than 90% of wars take place within, not between, states, the import of this finding far conflict prevention should be obvious. 
Prevention is no panacea. It requires that governments act in good faith and place the welfare of citizens above narrow sectional interests. But we know that some conflict-prone governments see prevention policies, particularly those which stress democratisation and good governance, as a threat to their own power and privilege. For that reason, they are likely to reject them. 
The fact that prevention will not work everywhere is an argument against naive optimism, but not against actively supporting democratisation, good governance and other preventive policies. These are not only important goods in their own right. They are also among the most potent and costeffective antidotes to the scourge of war.  1999 Water shortages will grow ever more serious; the stuff of future wars. Levels in aquifers, the underground layers of porous rock which hold most of the world's supply of fresh water, are dropping. By 2025, there will not be enough water to supply the basic needs of 18 nations, including Iran, Iraq, Afghanistan, Israel, Jordan and the Palestine area. Look out for tension between Turkey, Syria and Iraq over the Euphrates and between Egypt, Sudan and Ethiopia over the Nile. With 3.5 billion people affected by water shortages by 2050, conditions are ripe for a century of water conflicts. Curiously, these may well begin in the rich world. Canada is getting upset about losing its water to America. And within America quarrels between the states will grow more acute.  1999 Five main issues will dominate European Union business in 2000. The first will be trade. A new millennium round of world trade talks, launched in Seattle in November 1999, will mean a fierce and deserved assault on the Eu's protectionist farm policies. America, Australia and New Zealand will lead the attack. 
The Eu has no good arguments left to justify its farm subsidies, which cost taxpayers about $50 billion each year (half the Eu budget). They survive mainly because governments fear to offend riotprone Mediterranean farmers. All eyes will be on the defensive tactics devised by the Eu's newly appointed trade commissioner, Pascal Lamy, a Frenchman. France is the most instinctively protectionist country in the Eu. It is the staunchest defender (and, not coincidentally, the largest recipient) of farm subsidies. But Mr Lamy may yet surprise. Some say the new president of the European Commission, Romano Prodi, gave him the trade job because it will take a Frenchman to persuade France to accept a farm deal that includes the necessary cuts in subsidies. 
Second on the agenda is the need for administrative reform. The owlish Mr Prodi has promised to purge the European Commission of sleaze and waste, following the shamefaced resignation in March 1999 of the previous commission led by Jacques Santer. Reform is also necessary to cope with new members, mostly from Central and Eastern Europe. The Eu institutions-mainly, the European Commission and the Council of Ministers-were designed for six member states. A few tweaks have helped them accommodate a current membership of 15. But with the prospect of at least a dozen more countries joining the Union in the coming ten years, changes of substance will be needed. 
This will mean a new au treaty. To prepare it, governments will send ministers or ambassadors to a constitutional conference that will begin in the first half of the year, when Portugal holds the Eu presidency, and which will end in the second half of the year, when France is in charge. The talks must agree to cap the number of European commissioners at the present 20 (or less), however many more countries join the Union. The commission is the Eu's civil service. The commissioners who head it also have a strong policymaking role. At present, big countries send two commissioners each to Brussels and small countries send one. The big countries are resigned to losing their second commissioners as part of the effort to cut numbers. The question is how to persuade the small countries to accept a new system in which at least some of them may have no commissioners at all. 
A way must also be found to allocate voting power more fairly in the Council of Ministers. This body (and not the European Parliament, despite its name) is the Eu's legislature. Big countries have more votes in the council than small ones: the minister representing France has ten votes, his counterpart from Luxembourg has two. But additions to the council down the years have been dealt with ad hoc, and inequalities have accumulated. Governments need to agree on general rules for voting power when any new country joins. 
A new treaty must also widen qualified majority voting in the Council of Ministers. The more countries join the Eu, the more national vetoes may be wielded. That argues for taking more big decisions by qualified majority voting. (Qualified means that more than a simple majority is needed to pass a law. The present formula demands 62 votes out of a possible 85.) But opinions differ sharply as to the areas where more majority voting should be used. 
The Eu must keep sight of its third big bit of business in 2000: the enlargement process itself. Of the 12 countries recognised as possible new members (13 if Turkey is added), the six most promising will complete a first phase of negotiations with the European Commission by the summer. Each will have measured its national legislation minutely against all Eu legislation, and will have drawn up a plan for dealing with shortfalls. But each will have a few last points on which it wants special treatment-a waiver to run a heavily polluting power station, or permission to bar foreigners from buying farmland. These differences are meant to be settled in the second half of the year. 
The closer the first candidates edge towards readiness (Estonia, Poland and Hungary will probably be the leaders), the greater the pressure on Eu governments to give firm dates for entry. Even the most polite countries in the queue are losing their patience. They say that the longer entry dates are withheld, the harder it becomes for them to keep up the momentum of reforms needed to deliver on their side of the bargain. 
The fourth big Eu project for 2000 will be a charter of fundamental rights for all Eu citizens. This will be drafted by a diverse committee of worthies and reviewed by national leaders at a summit in December 2000. It is hard to say in advance how much impact this document will have. It may be just flimflam. It may have all sorts of practical consequences if the rights it enshrines are enforceable directly in law. In Brussels jargon, the charter of rights is meant to bring the Eu closer to the citizen. And too bad for the citizen who craves only the right to keep his distance. 
The final theme for 2000 will be that of European defence, a theme so important that it is dealt with separately in the article that follows. 
Robert Cottrell: EU correspondent for The Economist.  1999 In the coming year, the European Union will move decisively on to new terrain: it will adopt a common and assertive defence policy. In December 2000, at the Eu's Paris summit, heads of government will endorse a plan to give the Eu a military organisation. The Western European Union, a defence club of ten states that is currently semi-detached from the Eu, will be merged with it. The Eu will then be able to undertake small-scale military missions in its own name. 
The rationale of these plans is that Eu diplomacy would carry more weight if underpinned by the ability to deploy force. The initiative is not only about new European institutions, but also more capable armed forces. The Kosovo war reminded Eu governments that they cannot do a great deal without American support. They lack sophisticated command, control and communication systems; enough ships and aircraft for transporting men and equipment; precision-guided weaponry; and the airborne surveillance systems which can monitor events on the ground. 
Thus in the autumn of 1999, when the British government proposed that the Eu should adopt ""defence performance goals"" as a means of improving military capabilities, most other Eu governments welcomed the idea. The point of these performance goals would not be to get Eu states to increase defence budgets, since that is not politically feasible. It would rather be to encourage governments to spend their defence budgets more wisely. 
At present, for example, the combined defence budgets of the Eu governments amount to about half of the $290 billion that the United States spends on defence. But their ability to project force, away from home, is perhaps 10% that of the United States. Too many European governments spend their budgets on large conscript armies, rather than modern equipment and training. Governments need to keep their soldiers at a higher state of readiness; to provide them with the means to be mobile; and to be able to sustain them at a distance. 
Thus Eu defence ministers will agree to set goals (both for the Eu as a whole and for individual countries) on, for example, the numbers of soldiers they could deploy outside the NaTO area, and the length of time for which the force could be sustained. The Eu will not attempt to enforce these targets through centrally set rules. But there will be a process of peer review and exchange of best practice, perhaps supervised by the Eu's new high representative for foreign and defence policy, Javier Solana. 
Britain and France (which is introducing a professional army) already perform quite well; many other Eu countries do not. The Germans have a particular problem, with a large, ill-equipped conscript army that is geared to territorial defence. The leading role of Britain's prime minister, Tony Blair, in this defence initiative is crucial, for the British will have to convince the Americans that European defence is good for the Atlantic alliance. The British must point out to the Americans that the initiative is not designed to weaken NATO. For the Eu is unlikely to act on its own, unless the Americans do not wish to take part in a military enterprise. For example, if the Europeans wished to rescue Eu nationals from a civil war in North Africa, or to deploy peacekeepers in part of the Balkans, Americans might easily decline to take part. The Eu would then take political responsibility for such a mission, while using some of NATO's assets and command structures. 
The French like to talk about the Eu acting ""autonomously"" (a word that annoys the Americans), but even they do not want the Eu to build military organisations that duplicate what NATO does; they know the Europeans do not have the money. Many American policymakers admit to being in two minds about European defence. On the one hand, they would welcome a Europe that could do more militarily, and thus be of more help to the United States when it tries to sort out world crises. On the other, they worry that a more effective European foreign and security policy would sometimes oppose American interests. 
In practice the United States has little choice but to support this European defence initiative, while asking that its particular concerns be addressed (for example, that Turkey, in NaTO but not the Eu, should not be excluded from the new European defence arrangements). For if it opposed European defence in general, or vetoed the use of NATO assets to support the Eu on a particular occasion, this would prompt the Europeans to build military structures that were independent of NaTO, rather than closely linked to it. The United States will almost certainly bless the new European defence arrangements, when they are unveiled in Paris in December 2000. 
The role of individual politicians in making a success of this initiative will be crucial. George Robertson, NATO's secretary-general, Mr Solana, the Eu's high representative, and Chris Patten, the European commissioner for foreign policy, are all pro-European and committed Atlanticists. They will have to make the ""Common Foreign and Security Policy"" effective. And they must convince European governments, as well as Washington, that a strong European security policy is compatible with a solid Atlantic alliance and could even strengthen it. 
Charles Grant: director of the Centre for European Reform.  1999 France will enter a new century as convinced as ever of ""the French exception"", that blend of history and revolutionary culture which the French believe makes them unique-or, as foreigners sometimes reckon, simply awkward. The result will be a year of frequent irritation between France and its allies: there will be rows with America over the ""millennium round"" agenda of the World Trade Organisation; and with the European Commission and fellow members of the European Union over state aids, market access, institutional reform and the pace of the Eu's expansion eastwards. 
Indeed, when France assumes the Eu's rotating presidency in the second half of the year, its central role may increase rather than lessen the frictions. Yet it would be wrong to exaggerate France's awkwardness. On defence, for example, France is well aware, especially after the wars in the Gulf and in Kosovo, of its deficiencies, and so will lead the drive for a co-ordinated European capability. In this, it will build on the agreement reached with Britain at St Malo in December 1998. 
Moreover, many of the irritants in France's outward behaviour will stem from the histrionic nature of its domestic politics, in particular the campaign for the presidential election due in May 2002. President Jacques Chirac, a conservative, is determined to win a second seven-year term; the Socialist prime minister, Lionel Jospin, is determined to thwart Mr Chirac by winning the election for himself and his left-wing coalition. 
This ""cohabitation"" of a president and prime minister in opposition to each other is something French voters have seemingly grown fond of. A charitable explanation is that it forces politics to seek a middle ground; a cynical explanation is that it forestalls much needed reforms-of the tax system, for example, or education or trade union powersthat voters might individually find uncomfortable. 
Whatever the explanation, one of the big tests for Mr Jospin in the coming few months will be the implementation, from January 1st 2000, of a programme that helped win the left's surprise victory in 1997: the 35-hour week for firms employing 20 or more people (smaller firms will have to implement it from 2002). Rather than taking on new workers-the purpose of the programme-employers have tended to react by investing in productivity-raising technology. The consequence is that unemployment has stubbornly remained at over a tenth of the workforce. 
Mr Jospin claims this will change as robust economic growth (forecast at perhaps 3% in 2000) continues. If he is wrong, however there is likely to be a severe backlash from disappointed workers-and damage to several political reputations, especially that of the left-wing labour minister, Martine Aubry. By contrast, the influence of France's employers would increase. In any event, more follies of this kind are unlikely from the Jospin government. 
The debate, however, somewhat misses the point. France remains one of the most state-dominated nations in the Eu, with a costly welfare state (obligatory social charges are around 45% of GDP, compared with about 35% in America), a large public sector and a generous provision of public services. It is this structure, with its rhetoric of ""solidarity"" between social classes, that helps identify the ""French exception"". 
Yet the truth is that France is becoming less exceptional. The nationalisations of the early Mitterrand years have been transformed into a sustained programme of privatisation from which few state firms-not even France Telecom-have been exempted. Indeed Renault, once an emblem of the state sector, has become a private-sector leader confident enough not just to take control of Japan's Nissan but to cut a swathe through its workforce. Meanwhile, hostile takeover bids are no longer inconceivable. French companies, such as Vivendi, seize markets overseas; and stock-options are the required reward of a new generation of senior managers. 
In other words, for all the strikes-by the left, by the students, by the farmers, and by other interest groups-that are a commonplace of French politics, and for all the populist rhetoric against business, France, it seems, is stealthily adopting some Anglo-Saxon habits.  1999 The Germans are in a paradoxical mood. They say they want reforms, but then rebel against the measures needed to achieve them. Most of them understand that public spending is too high. They have been told over and over again that the public debt has tripled since the fall of the Berlin Wall, and is now above the limit imposed by membership of the European currency union. But presented with a tax-and-spending reform package designed to take DM30 billion ($16.5 billion) off the budget for 2000, they have demonstrated their distaste at the ballot box. In a string of regional and local elections in the autumn of 1999, they have given a mighty drubbing to the ruling Social Democrats and their coalition partners, the Greens. Worse could be to come if the voters in North Rhine-Westphalia abandon their long-standing support for the Social Democrats in key regional elections in May 2000. With nearly 18m people, this state has nearly a quarter of Germany's population. Cassandras are already muttering that if North Rhine-Westphalia goes, then so must the chancellor, Gerhard Schroder. 
It all looked very different in September 1998 when Mr Schroder won a famous victory over the Christian Democrat Chancellor Helmut Kohl, a veteran heavyweight who had lasted 16 years in office. True, in order to get a working majority Mr Schroder had to enter a coalition with the small Green Party, a combination that had never before been tried at federal level, and was clearly going to involve some compromises. Fortunately, the Greens' star turn, Joschka Fischer, who demanded and got the foreign ministry, turned out to be both more reasonable and more capable than many of his new colleagues had feared. He also proved a hit with the public: he is now well ahead of the chancellor himself in opinion polls. Unfortunately his party's popularity with the public is on the wane, casting doubt on the coalition's long-term viability. 
The main problem for Mr Schroder so far, however, has come not from the Greens but from the ranks of his own party. In March 1999, only six months into the new government's term of office, Oskar Lafontaine, the finance minister and Social Democratic Party chairman, resigned from his post after a series of stormy disagreements with the chancellor. But out of office has not meant out of sight or mind: Mr Lafontaine has styled himself as the defender of his party's traditional left-wing values, and continues to snipe at the chancellor from the sidelines. His successor as finance minister, Hans Eichel, is a less mercurial character, and much closer to Mr Schroder. He is widely thought to have made a good start in his job, but his detractors maintain he has the charisma of a paper clip. 
Mr Schroder came to office on the promise of delivering a ""new centre"", a somewhat vague concept apparently similar to the ""third way"" successfully pursued by Britain's prime minister, Tony Blair. The two leaders seem to enjoy slapping each other's backs in public, but many of their similarities are only skin-deep. Mr Blair took over as leader of the Labour Party well ahead of the election that brought him to power in May 1997, which gave him time to shape it in his image. Mr Schroder, by contrast, was chosen as the Social Democrats' candidate for the chancellorship only a few months before the 1998 election, so his party remained unreformed and his relationship with the trade unions unresolved. Large chunks of his party are uncomfortable with his attempts to get closer to business, and disapprove of his reform plans. 
For good measure, Mr Schroder is also having more trouble with the Christian Democratic opposition than his majority in the lower house of parliament, the Bundestag, seemed to indicate. The regional-election defeats the Social Democrats suffered during 1999 have lost them the majority they held in the upper house, the Bundesrat, which matters because Bundesrat approval is required for all major financial legislation, including the proposed budget-reform package. 
So will the Christian Democrats play hard to get? They must be tempted. After all, in their last few years in power they themselves were trying to introduce similar reforms, and were thwarted by the Social Democrat opposition which at that time had a majority in the Bundesrat. In blocking these reforms, the Social Democrats introduced a new word into the German vocabulary: Reformstau (reform logjam). The Christian Democrats, having publicly acknowledged the need for reforms, may not want to cast themselves in such an obstructionist role, so the chances are that they will allow through at least some of the budget reforms (but extract concessions in return). 
If he can get his budget through, Mr Schroder's fortunes may yet improve. The German economy, after growing by less than 1.5% in 1999, looks set for 2.5% or more in 2000, thanks partly to strong exports. Despite Germany's image as an economic tortoise-slow to abandon excessive regulation and introduce market reform-a great deal of restructuring has been going on behind the scenes that is beginning to make industry leaner and fitter. Investment looks set to pick up. Inflation has almost disappeared from the radar screen, but private consumption will remain hesitant, because unemployment-which today's Germans care more deeply about than any other economic issue-is likely to remain above 10%. And that figure is an average for Germany as a whole. In former East Germany, which remains stubbornly poorer and less productive than former West Germany, unemployment is double that in the west, at over 17%. 
There is more cheer to be had from contemplating Germany's place in the wider world. During NaTO's intervention in Kosovo in the spring of 1999, Mr Schroder reassured his partners by his clear commitment to the cause and by his ability to keep his pacifist-minded Green coalition partner on board. Looking ahead, Germany is expected to play a prominent part in the negotiations for enlarging the European Union to the east that are now getting under way. More broadly, the Germans> after decades of trying to live down their recent history, are becoming more self-confident: twothirds of them think that the past is becoming less important and that their country, with 82m people and much the biggest economy of any Eu member, should play a leading European role. With the government's move from Bonn to Berlin now more or less complete, 2000 will be the first year in half a century when a German government has operated from a ""permanent"" rather than a ""provisional"" capital. 
If there were to be an election next Sunday, the Social Democrats would probably see their share of the vote plummet well below that of the Christian Democrats, and their coalition partners, the Greens, might be consigned to electoral oblivion. But the next federal election is not due until the autumn of 2002. Mr Schroder clearly cannot afford to be complacent but nor, as yet, should he allow himself to become unduly depressed. When his predecessor, Mr Kohl, first became chancellor, he slipped on so many banana skins that critics doubted he could last his full term. He went on to become Germany's longest-serving chancellor since Bismarck. 
Barbara Beck: surveys editor, The Economist.  1999 The biggest single happening in 2000 will be the World Exposition that opens in Hanover Germany, on June 1st. Some 40m people will visit it before it shuts at the end of October, over 250,000 a day. The World Exposition movement-now shortened to Expo-was started in London in 1851. Then it was held in the Crystal Palace which was erected by Prince Albert, Queen Victoria's German husband, in Hyde Park. When it came to Paris, the Eiffel Tower was built. In Hanover there will be nothing so spectacular, except the statistics: Expo 2000 will generate $1.7 billion; 191 countries will display their wares, mostly in their own pavilions. This will be the first major international event held in Germany since unification. You can be sure that will be worth the visit: a better bet than London's Dome.  1999 Many people have come to see the Netherlands as a model country. It is the most successful of the core Eu countries. Its economy, which combines market liberalisation with social fairness, remained buoyant when several of its Eu partners struggled in the face of the world's economic troubles. But for how much longer can this social and economic ""bed of roses"", to use a popular Dutch expression, stay in full bloom? 
Paradoxically, flourishing economic conditions seem to present the greatest danger. The Netherlands owes much of its success to its tradition of effective negotiation and consensus between the government, the employer federations and the trade unions. This has produced some excellent policies in recent years, such as restraints on public spending, reforms of the labour market and the social-security system, and wage moderation. But these measures were taken in less rosy economic times. Now the 15-year-old consensus is eroding. 
In boom times corporate profits have risen strongly and trade unions are increasingly unwilling to accept wage restraint for the sake of the international competitiveness of Dutch firms, when executives are rewarding themselves with huge pay rises. Unbridled consumer spending and spiralling house prices have cast further doubts on the sustainability of the Dutch model. 
A period of economic belttightening may be just what is needed. Employment growth, which has been a source of envy for the country's Eu partners, will come to a halt in 2000, weakening consumer confidence and dampening the economy. Meanwhile, spirits could be raised if, as many expect, the Dutch national team wins the European soccer championship, which it is co-hosting with Belgium. The Orange feel-good factor tends to work wonders for Dutch morale and community spirit.  1999 Although they live in a divided country, Belgians have a talent for showing solidarity in times of crisis. When faced with an emergency (not a rare occurrence: a string of scandals has entangled the country in recent years) feuds between the Dutchspeaking Flemish and French-speaking Walloon communities are put on hold and people unite. When an outrage involving an outbreak of food contamination through the mixing of dioxin with animal feed erupted in May 1999, Belgians of all kinds responded by being uncharacteristically decisive. They showed their discontent through the ballot box by throwing out the government and putting an end to 40 years of political domination by the Christian Democrats. 
The question now will be: can the new government, an untried combination of Liberals, Socialists and Greens, pull the country out of its doldrums? It is helped by the fact that the previous government did bring public finances under control. After the setback from the food scare, Belgium is back on track to benefit from a general au-wide and global economic recovery. cnr growth will accelerate to a respectable 2.6%. Inflation will pick up slightly but remain safely below the price stability target set by the European Central Bank. 
But the danger is that, once the initial enthusiasm for change has faded along with the latest scandal, the country's underlying divisions will resurface. The new coalition could split not only as a result of the reemergence of linguistic divisions but also over important policy issues such as privatisation, working time, taxation or social benefits. Above all it will want to avoid another major setback and to improve the international image of Belgium in a year when Brussels will be a European city of culture and Ghent will celebrate the 500th anniversary of Charles V's birth.  1999 Several million pilgrims will pour into Rome during the course of 2000 for the Jubilee of the Catholic Church. Catholic parishes around the world are independently preparing their own groups of pilgrims to St Peter's, making the numbers that will come difficult to predict. No other city, except perhaps London, is taking the millennium so seriously, with many museums being renovated and events planned by no means only at the Vatican. Rome's ability to cope with the crowds will be tested well beyond its limit. So, if you have no religious motives to visit Italy's capital, wait for 2001. 
Waiting may prove difficult, though, for Massimo D'Alema, whose centre-left government does not have to face a general election until 2001. His parliamentary majority is a rowdy bunch which includes Catholic militants and greens, free-marketeers and hard-line communists, former socialists and disgruntled faithfuls of Romano Prodi, the current president of the European Commission, who consider Mr D'Alema responsible for Mr Prodi's abrupt dismissal from Palazzo Chigi (the prime minister's residence) in 1998. This is not new, of course, in a country that has had 56 governments since the second world war. 
Yet Italians are growing impatient with short-lived administrations; they want stability. If the current centre-left majority dissolves because of internal squabbles-and it might-the centreright, led by tycoon-cum-politician Silvio Berlusconi, will easily win the next election, despite its leader's legal tangles (three convictions, appeals pending, more trials coming up). 
Youth unemployment and crime will be the most heated political topics. A short-sighted immigration policy and an uncomfortable geographical position-- the Balkans are just a few miles across the Adriatic-have allowed many illegal immigrants to sneak into the country. Unlike the law-abiding million-odd immigrants, many of these clandestine have set up criminal rings that compete or cooperate with the local mob. 
The economy will grow rather slowly but will become more competitive and transparent. Within the European Monetary Union, export-oriented Italy does not have the advantage of a weak currency; and Mario Monti, the commissioner for competition in Brussels, watches severely over his own country. Some will moan as more of Italy's top brands are snapped up by foreign companies. As outgoing investments are five times higher than incoming ones, nobody should care. The complaints of foreign investors will help to cut down the forest of red tape, still the primary problem for Italy's economy. A guess: Fiat, Italy's largest private group, will find the global partner it is looking for. 
Reform in Italy cannot be delayed, despite years of successful resistance. The list of things needing attention is almost universally agreed: 
Justice. The average time between indictment and a court judgment is ten years; eight out of ten convictions that involve prison terms never take effect. 
Defence. The armed forces are outdated, apart from a few elite corps. 
Transport. There are too many strikes in the public-transport system; the motorway system has become obsolete. 
The health service. Hospitals in big cities are run down; there are too many doctors everywhere. 
Welfare. Pensions eat up too much of Italy's public finances and will bankrupt the government unless there are further reductions. 
Each of these will provide plenty of scandals and general unhappiness in 2000. But ferocious lobbying will prevent much from happening. A small piece of legislation, a magistrate, a political party, a street rally: weapons are not hard to find in Italy if you want to stop something from happening. 
The improvements needed in Italy's civic society are also universally acknowledged; and they will also be slow in coming. Too many Italians will avoid paying taxes in 2000. According to one estimate, 30% of all incomes are hidden from the taxman, and up to 50% in the south of the country. Too few will wear seat belts. On average, according to Automobil Club Italiano, only 20% do, compared with 80% in the rest of the Eu. Stopping at zebra crossings will still be considered bizarre behaviour. 
Nonetheless, a generation of professional people, which travelled and studied abroad in the 1980s, is coming of age, and will leave its mark. English will be more widely spoken. And although several north European countries fear creeping ""Italianisation"", Italy will pick up some northern habits. Some good (a less emotional attitude; more attention to the environment; a desire for more stable government). Some less so (more television-watching, more heavy drinking and violence among young people). 
An easy prediction: il calcio (football) will dominate 2000. The amount of money spent by the teams, the television time and newspaper space devoted to the sport will be staggering-even those Vatican pilgrims will notice that Italy has at least another, more mundane, faith. 
Beppe Severgnini: columnist for Corriere della Sera and Italy correspondent for The Economist. His latest book is ""Italiani si diventa"" (Rizzoli).  1999 Adjourn nowadays to one of the Dublin pubs immortalised by James Joyce for some of that famous chat and Guinness, and there is a fair chance that your barperson will be from Brisbane or Barcelona, unskilled in the great art of pulling a good pint of the black stuff. Ireland's prolonged boom is bringing the world to its doorstep. 
The republic is about to enter the sixth year of a cycle in which Irish economic growth rates have outstripped all Eu and oECD states. In 1999 the economy grew by 6-7%, compared with a eurozone average of 2% and an oECD average of about 2.4%. In 2000, Irish growth will probably be around 6%, with unemployment between 4% and 5%, and a surplus of perhaps IRL2 billion ($1.4 billion) for the exchequer. 
The visitor will hear of Monte Carlo-scale prices for houses in the south Dublin suburbs and sonorous tales of delivery delays for new luxury cars. Friday's Irish Times will come weighted with pages of,job offers for computer engineers, investment analysts and financial-services specialists. And, invariably, the visitor will hear the question posed, ""How long will it last?"" 
The answer in terms of living standards is probably indefinitely, although future growth is not going to be maintained at near double-digit figures and the staggering rise in house prices will tail off. The industries that sustain the Irish economic wonder-computers, electronics, pharmaceuticals and financial services-are well-embedded. Membership of the euro will ensure tight fiscal controls, low interest rates and modest inflation. The biggest threat may be the shortage of skilled employees. Ireland's wealth per head may have edged ahead of the United Kingdom but it still lags behind that of France, Germany, the Benelux and the Scandinavian countries. There should be nothing too remarkable about a small state of 3.5m people, by and large well-educated, achieving mainstream European levels of earnings more than a quarter-century after joining the EEC. But there are more searching questions to be asked. 
Dublin is not Ireland. And the elegant villas of Killiney and Howth are not Dublin. Serious problems of regional imbalance remain, with the midlands and the Atlantic seaboard counties trailing well behind the capital and the eastern towns. There are evident problems. The rail system is poor and unreliable. Modern motorways peter off into two-lane country roads. Dublin's daily traffic tangles are the stuff of urban legend. Under pressure from increasingly impatient business and industry sectors, the Fianna Fail-led government of Bertie Ahern will start a IR33 billion programme of infrastructural investment in 2000 to stretch over seven years. 
The republic's middle classes are doing better but the poor, according to the latest OECD figures, are faring proportionately less well. Almost half a million investors made paper profits-at least in the short term-out of the privatisation of the national telecom company in 1999 and something similar is likely to happen, probably towards the end of 2000, with the flotation of Aer Lingus, the state airline. Notwithstanding the emergence of this new shareowning class and the huge increase in jobs, a core of almost 100,000 long-term unemployed will remain in 2000. In certain bleak suburban wastelands the recurring cycle of poor education, crime, drugs and poverty has yet to be broken. 
The priority for the government in 2000 will be to renew the successful national pay partnerships which have set the framework for economic growth. The unions will probably agree if the government can find ways in which to reduce, rather than exacerbate, social and economic inequity and to even out the growing imbalances in regional development. Efforts to date have not been notably successful. Runaway house prices and speculative investment will see many young couples-even those with good jobs-still unable to buy a home in Dublin. 
Mr Ahern's government depends on the support of the Progressive Democrats and a number of independents in the Dail. Two judicial tribunals, sitting at Dublin Castle to investigate (among other things) the allegations of corruption against a former prime minister, Charles Haughey, will be reporting within the next year. So too will be a special committee of the Dail, investigating the role of the banks and the revenue authorities in tax-evasion. The political and business establishments, many of whose leading lights have been in and out of the witness box, await the tribunals' reports with trepidation. So far, Mr Ahern has remained largely untouched by the tide of sleaze but if this were to change it is certain that his coalition partners would insist on a switch of leadership. In that event, watch for the rise of Charles McCreevey, the finance minister, or the clean-cut, not-yet-40, education minister, Micheal Martin. 
There is also something new in the Irish air. The country's once-undiluted enthusiasm for Europe is on the wane. Ireland will shortly become a net contributor to the Eu coffers, bringing the gravy train, which has undoubtedly contributed greatly to the recent years of prosperity, to a halt. Simultaneously, the government's decision to make a military commitment to NATO's Partnership for Peace initiative will provide a focus to the debate over the increase in these international links, and their threat to Ireland's longstanding and sacrosanct tradition of neutrality. 
The slow, painstaking search for a settlement in Northern Ireland will continue. Few expect a breakdown in the form of a return to full-scale violence. The IRA's political wing, Sinn Fein, has discovered that not all power grows from the barrel of a gun-and will be busy during the year, seeking to build its future electoral base, north and south. A working settlement in Northern Ireland would greatly enhance Mr Ahern's political prestige. As ever, in 2000, the Irish both north and south will recognise that they are obliged to share life on a very small island. With peace confirmed in one part and prosperity in the other, 2000 will be a year of promise. 
Conor Brady: editor, Irish Times.  1999 Outside observers tend to imagine that the Nordic countries share common ""Nordic values"" and have the same attitudes towards most issues. But neighbourliness does not mean uniformity. Take the crucial issue of Economic and Monetary Union (EMU), which reveals striking differences between the countries. 
Sweden and Denmark, which have so far opted out of the single currency, will grapple with the issue of joining. Goran Persson, the pro-EMU Swedish prime minister, faces powerful opposition to participation from within and outside his party, making a Swedish move towards membership unlikely. Mr Persson will hope that a party congress in early 2000 will at least lead his party to back his policy wholeheartedly. So much euroscepticism in Sweden makes Denmark, which nearly derailed the Maastricht treaty with its infamous ""no"" vote in 1992, look positively pro-European. Its prime minister, Poul Nyrup Rasmussen, can expect a majority in favour of EMU membership in a referendum, which could be held in late 2000. 
Finland, by far the most proEuropean Nordic country, was a founder-member of EMU. Finns can therefore worry about other issues, such as electing a new president in early 2000. Elisabeth Rehn looks set to become the first female Finnish president. By contrast, Norway is not even an Eu member (and with oil revenue recovering nicely in 2000 after the 1998 price collapse, Norwegians will be in no hurry to change their minds on Eu membership). That rules out the EMU possibility altogether. 
Whatever the stance on EMU, and despite varying growth prospects (1.8% in Denmark, 4.5% in Iceland), there will be one common Nordic theme in 2000: budgetary virtue. Iceland's budget will be close to balance. And the other four will be able to report a surplus on the general government balance.  1999 An uncanny silence, punctuated by the occasional roar, will fall over Europe for two hours in the early evening of Sunday July 2nd. The continent's lOOm football fans will be glued to their television sets watching the final of the European Championship being fought out in Rotterdam. 
This championship, second only to football's once-every-four-years World Cup, is being hosted by two nations: the Netherlands and Belgium. Ironically, these neighbouring countries have a particular enmity towards each other on the football field; recent matches between them have seen players on both sides sent off, as well as an onpitch brawl. 
For stylish play look to Italy, which boasts the world's costliest player, the 90 billion lire ($50m) Christian Vieri. France, which in a typically centralised French way has a well-financed and well-subsidised development programme for young players, will do well. Not well enough though to beat the Dutch, whose big-name players such as Edgar Davids (Juventus), Japp Stam (Manchester United) and Patrick Kluivert (Barcelona) play in foreign leagues. They have the look of favourites.  1999 The year 2000 will mark the 25th anniversary of the death of General Franco, the autocrat who governed the country for nearly four decades, after scoring a cruel and bloody victory in the Spanish civil war (1936-39). A quarter of a century after the death of the man who dubbed himself ""Caudillo"" (""Fuhrer""), the Spain governed by the children and grandchildren of the civil war bears few signs of the Franco legacy. More than 20 years of parliamentary democracy and a growing openness to the rest of the world have changed the face of Spain. 
Spain in 2000 will be curiously certain as to the role it wants to play: there will be none of the European doubts that there are in Britain> none of the tentativeness about foreign policy still to be found in Germany. Since June 1985, when Felipe Gonzalez, the socialist prime minister, signed the Spanish accession to the Eu, through to its current participation in monetary union, as ratified by the right-wing Jose Maria Aznar, each government has followed the same policy. All political parties have worked for a nation with a capitalist economy, firmly integrated into the institutions of the western world, and all want Spain to be an enthusiastic partner with Europe and with Latin America. The few remaining doubts about the inevitability of these policies have been raised, paradoxically, by more conservative thinkers, the heirs to Franco's power, rather than by Social Democrats. Indeed, the current ruling right-wing party abstained in Mr Gonzalez's referendum on entry into NaTO. Only a few months before coming into power, Mr Aznar had no qualms about declaring his opposition to the euro. Yet today he has emerged as one of its greatest supporters. 
Spaniards seem to feel that international alliances are the best antidote to the devils at home. Spain is anxious to anchor itself in other people's liberalism, lest the ghosts of 25 years ago return. The 20th century started badly for Spain with the loss of the remnants of its colonial empire and its defeat at the hands of the United States. A dogged introspection came into vogue, and Spain distanced itself from Europe. This exaggerated gloom of the past is the intellectual precursor of the equally exaggerated exuberance and internationalism of 2000. 
The enthusiasm shown by some Spanish business executives for globalisation has at times reached ridiculous extremes, with near neo-imperialist overtones. Spain, for example, has become one of the major international investors in Latin America. This has led to considerable resentment from the ruling classes in the so-called sister republics. They welcome the investment, but resent the arrogance of companies such as Telefonica and Endesa. Spain might be their mother country but mother is often best kept 3,000 miles away. 
Spaniards have exploited the unquestionable power of Castilian as the unifying language of more than 20 countries. The cultural unity of Latin America rests largely in the power of Spanish as a common language, in which there are none of the differences or divergences which, for example, separate American from British English. The growth of the Spanish-speaking population north of the Rio Grande gives rise to the hope that Spanish business people and intellectuals may now have an opportunity to flourish in the United States. A number of Spanish media companies are firmly ensconced on the other side of the Atlantic. Seeing this move, many companies from the Eu are now coming to Spain in order to gain a foothold there before leaping across the Atlantic to Latin America. Publishers provide a good example: Bertelsmann, Pearson, Havas and Hachette have all invested in Spain with an eye to the new world. 
The new Spain's global spirit has strange facets. While, for instance, it is considered a sign of modernity to admit to being a Basque, Catalan or Galician nationalist, the old Spanish nationalism hardly dares lift its head at home. It only shows its face, with the arrogance of old, in the American subcontinent.

The 1999 fiscal deficit ballooned into double digits as the economy went into recession and spending ran ahead of plan-first because of government largesse before early parliamentary elections, then as reconstruction got under way in the aftermath of the devastating August earthquake. Spending will have to be checked, but not at the expense of rebuilding the 60,000 homes that were destroyed or damaged in the earthquake. 
Only with speedy reconstruction can the government hope to take the edge off public anger over the authorities' ineptitude revealed by the earthquake. If this does not appear to be working, the government will not hesitate to resort to old-fashioned censorship. With many journalists, politicians and intellectuals already behind bars for no more than voicing their differences with the state, Turks are likely to get on with rebuilding their lives and leave politics to the same tired leaders who have been running the country for years. 
The justice system will come under further scrutiny as Abdullah Ocalan, the head of the Kurdish guerrilla movement, the Kurdistan Workers' Party, faces execution following his June 1999 conviction in a Turkish court. Before the death sentence can be carried out, parliament must approve it. The Turks have not executed anyone for 15 years. Mr Ocalan is, therefore, more likely to rot in jail. Not least, this would help Turkey's relations with the Eu to improve over the coming year. Formal accession talks will not start until human-rights problems are solved. Greece's long-time animosity will fade, but will not disappear altogether.  1999 In 2000, the countries that once loyally orbited the Soviet Union will have much to celebrate. A decade on from communism's demise across Central and Eastern Europe, they have firmly locked on to a new orbit around Brussels. Although hardly paragons of democracy and transparency, they have steered clear of the virulent crony capitalism that has infected Russia and most other former Soviet states. And, for the most part, their economies have proved resilient enough to pull through the Russian crisis and the war in Kosovo relatively unscathed. 
There is still far to go. Even among the frontrunners, such as Poland, Slovenia and Hungary, economic reforms are half finished at best and it is the most socially sensitive of these that have been postponed. Meanwhile, hopes for early entry to the Eu will be dashed again in 2000 despite renewed efforts to speed up the process. As a result, anti-western voices will grow louder. 
The economic picture is mixed, but generally positive. The Czech Republic, the region's fallen star, will start to grow again after two years of painful recession. Now that some of the past governments' sillier plans have been overhauled-including a botched privatisation programme that left insiders, or worse, no one, in control of companies-the economy should emerge more competitive and less prone to currency crashes than before. Still, it will be years before the Czechs can again claim star status in the eastern part of the continent. Overdue corporate restructuring may yet push unemployment over 10%. 
Poland will once again put in an impressive performance. After years of tigerish growth, the economy slowed in 1999, weighed down by the emergingmarkets' crisis. The pick-up it will experience in 2000, registering growth of 5%, will be a testament to its success in moving its trade towards the eurozone, where growth is once again reviving; one-third of Poland's exports now go to Germany alone. 
There is no call for smugness, however. Not even Poland is close to hitting the sort of growth rates that might bring living standards up to European Union levels within another 20 years. Moreover, 2000 will be the year that those countries at the front of the pack have to start grappling in earnest with the second stage of post-communist reform. 
Selling thousands of stateowned companies, cleaning up financial regulation and bringing inflation down to single digits are no mean feats, to be sure. However, the next stage will be even tougher. The region is still full of very big companies in heavy industries that make no profit but absorb plenty of public money. Now that political heads are finally emerging from the sand, the task will be to restructure these, at great cost to jobs, leaving smaller but more competitive industries in their wake. The list stretches from mining (a particular worry in Poland and Romania) to steel and defence. Such restructuring will strain some national budgets to breaking point: for all its economic dynamism, Poland cannot rule out a currency wobble in 2000. 
As governments tackle the most sodaily sensitive areas of economic reform, and jobs disappear in their thousands, public resentment will grow. This will manifest itself in increased scepticism towards integration with western clubs that are seen as driving those reforms, in particular the Eu. For ministers in Prague, Warsaw and Budapest, Eu membership remains the main foreign-policy objective. However, ordinary Central and East Europeans increasingly see the Eu as a protectionist clique that wants to prise open its applicants' markets but is prepared to concede little in return. 
Their distrust of Brussels will spread in 2000, as opponents of membership or those who want it delayed persuade voters that quick accession amounts to economic prostitution. Unease will also grow as it becomes clear that accession talks will get thornier as they advance. Although much ground has been covered, the rockiest areas-in particular agriculture-are yet to be properly discussed. The talks may not founder on farm trade, but they are certain to get heavily bogged down: one reason, perhaps, why the Eu remains reluctant to set firm admission dates for any of the six leading applicants (five from Eastern Europe, plus Cyprus). 
Economic nationalism will grow loudest in Poland. Support among Poles for joining the Eu is dwindling fast, down from 80% in 1996 to 55%. During 2000 that figure will keep falling, to below 50%, as parties that oppose Eu membership, such as the Christian Nationalists in the ruling coalition, strike a chord with the growing number of voters who worry that their country is rushing into a bad deal. The debate over whether Poland has let in too much foreign capital sparked by the sale of most big banks to foreigners, will also intensify. Foreign supermarket chains will come under fire for undermining small local shops. Politicians may be forced to listen. 
Anti-EU sentiment will not be limited to Poland. In Hungary too, there is strong opposition to selling land to foreigners, largely based on fears of German money flooding the market. In the Czech Republic, a kind of cultural nationalism is taking root as intellectuals increasingly criticise the ""mindless"" western films and television programmes that now dominate. Nor is the frustration directed solely at Brussels: in 2000, Eastern Europe's main stockmarkets will lose much of their best business to Frankfurt. 
Some good may come of this. In the mid-1990s, governments in Central and Eastern Europe were able to push through painful economic reforms by blaming them on the iMF. (""Not our fault. Either we do this or we don't get the money,"" and so on.) With the Eu becoming something of a bogeyman in Eastern Europe, the same governments might now be able to use it as a scapegoat for the latest bout of reforms. Take that too far, however, and the reward is entry to a club that your electorate is loth to join. 
Matthew Valencia: Eastern Europe correspondent, The Economist.  1999 Russia will look different next year, but not where it matters. By the end of 2000 Russia will have a new president, a new government, a new parliament and a new image. Its problems, however, will be much the same as before. (This will not bother the stockmarket-at least at first. Expect Russian asset prices to surge in the second half of the year, as outside investors start convincing themselves that the new political leadership makes this vast and cheap emerging market irresistible value.) 
It is true that Russia will sound and feel more consistently governed. The new lower house of parliament, elected (war and bombs permitting) on December 19th 1999, will prove less cantankerous and silly than the one elected four years ago. It will almost certainly get on better with the country's new president, due to be elected on July 3rd. That will avoid some of the crassest squabbles and confrontations of recent years. It will make it easier, for example, to adopt a more rational tax code (the current one offers a bleak choice between insolvency, if followed, and bribes to the tax inspector, if not). Other laws on, say, corporate governance, bankruptcy, or even private ownership of land could all go through. 
There will be other bits of good news. Foreign creditor countries, always willing to give Russia one last chance, will probably negotiate new terms (even a write-off) of the $42 billion state-to-state debt inherited from the Soviet Union. Coupled with a continued high oil price, and perhaps even a new Eurobond issue, that could make Russia's finances look misleadingly rosy. Foreign direct investors, in industries ranging from consumer goods to forestry, will reckon that Russia's 140m population and wealth of raw materials are worth a punt-especially if their investments are underwritten by western governments. 
But the boomlet will be deceptive. Although international goodwill, solvency and sensible laws may be necessary conditions for Russia to prosper, they are certainly not sufficient ones. The biggest problem, of ingrained lawlessness, is the result of centuries of bad government (first feudal, then communist) and will take a generation or more to change. 
This will continue to hit Russia at three levels. First, an alarming overlap between corrupt officials, gangsters and industrialists will remain the central feature of political and economic life. The growth-killing idea that a guaranteed big slice of a small pie is much better than a possible small slice of a much larger one is deeply rooted-and in Russia's dismal condition quite reasonably so. Russia's market will remain oligopolistic-meaning that there is competition of a sort, but only among the limited number of companies willing to bribe their way in. 
Second, Russian banking will remain stunted, unable to channel the country's savings into its industry. A legal system in which a bank can reliably collect the collateral on a bad loan, regardless of the debtor's location or political clout, is still many years away. Timid, underpaid judges inevitably favour powerful local interests. While that continues no sane bank is going to lend much long term. 
Third, everyday life in Russia will remain miserably backward and inefficient. You want a passport? Then go and queue for a couple of days (or slip someone a bribe). You want a driving licence? The same. Or to register your car, pass an exam, avoid military service, start a business? The same. In both the public and private sectors, promises and deadlines are for the most part unenforceable. Every minor inefficiency is somebody's livelihood. In happier coun tries, the public complains by writing to lawmakers or the newspapers-or there may even be an ombudsman, free legal advice or easily accessible courts. Not much sign of that starting in Russia. 
It was these problems that wrecked Russia's economy in 1998. This time the cycle of illusion and disillusion will be shorter. The new authorities will certainly proclaim that a new law-abiding era has begun. There will probably be some show-trials for those figures from the past who have failed to make the necessary arrangements (emigration or switching sides being the two most obvious). But soon enough-by 2001 at the latest-it will be clear that the changes are superficial, and that Russia remains, at heart, as morally and financially bankrupt as before. Investors, remembering how badly they were caught out in 1998, will stampede for the exit. 
Does it matter? Yes. Another crash will underline Russia's isolation from the rest of the world and highlight the gulf opening up, seemingly inexorably, between the eastern and western halves of the post-communist world. 
Edward Lucas: Russia correspondent, 
The Economist.  1999 Like Russia's economy, foreign policy will be deceptive. Under a new president, whether it is the portly Yevgeny Primakov or the steely Vladimir Putin (the latter was President Boris Yeltsin's favourite in late 1999), or some other candidate, the style will be more vigorous and assertive. Alcohol, illness and old age made every public appearance by Mr Yeltsin risky, and sometimes outright humiliating. 
President X will have foreign policy ideas of his own, and will take to the world stage to promote them. This will be something of a shock for western policymakers, used to Russia's role in recent years as a grumpy, unreliable but largely untroublesome force in world affairs. Where Russia still has a few cards to play-with nuclear weapons, or against its even weaker neighboursexpect tough bargaining. The biggest tussle will be over the future of the former captive nations, especially in Central Asia and the Caucasus, and possibly the Baltic states. 
Bad news? Not really. Although some alarmists will talk of a new cold war whenever a row flares up, Russia is so weak that it can advance its interests only if the West loses its nerve. Money matters most to Russia's rulers. Sound and fury are all very well (and so is friendship, although there are few takers on the western side for that now) but making sure that the country stays integrated into the world economy, so as to sell oil, gas, gold and diamonds, to borrow and launder money, and to pay for imports of consumer goods, is most important of all. 
Look beyond the central authorities' stroppiness, and another trend-the decentralisation of foreign policy-will become more visible in 2000. GovernorsRussia's powerful regional barons-are often unsavoury or incompetent (or both). But the brighter ones have already begun to realise the benefits of foreign investment. 
The scores of regional commercial representatives already based abroad will grow in importance. If you want to deal with the men who matter in a country, you end up talking to their representatives. The regions have no nuclear weapons, but on most other questions, the governors' words will count for more, and the central government's for a lot less.  1999 Decommissioning of Ulster's terrorist weapons should be completed by May. Completed? The question is whether the IRA will have started. 
Tony Blair in 2000 will preside over the final destruction of the traditional British constitution. Neither he nor anyone else knows what will emerge in its place. 
The old constitution was highly centralised. In contrast to most democratic countries, there were no autonomous centres of political power. The prime minister and cabinet controlled the legislature. The absence of a written constitution and a bill of rights meant that the courts lacked the power to strike down acts of parliament. Local government was a creature of central government. There was no regional or provincial tier of government at all. 
Centralisation on this scale exhibited all the usual vices: delay, rigidity, excessive uniformity and a tendency towards ""the universalisation of error"", but it had one virtue. Centralisation of power meant centralisation of responsibility. The buck stopped at Westminster. When things went wrong, the British people knew who to blame. If they wanted to throw the rascals out, they knew precisely who the rascals were-as John Major discovered the hard way in 1997. 
No longer. National governments will still come and go, but they now have rivals. The last year of the old millennium saw the setting up of a largely autonomous Scottish parliament and a less autonomous-but still potentially pesky-Welsh assembly. The first year of the new millennium will see the process taken further. 
In early May, London-which has not had a metropolis-wide political authority since Margaret Thatcher abolished the Greater London Council in 1986-will elect for the first time its own executive mayor as well as a representative city council. The new authority's powers are limited; education, for example, will remain in the hands of the capital's 32 boroughs. But from May 2000 onwards London, like Paris, Berlin and Brussels, will have a highly visible presence in national politics. 
The practice of electing executive mayors, new to Britain, will begin to take hold in 2000 as big cities start to hold referendums to decide whether to adopt a mayoral system. Several will conclude that they should elect prominent local boys and girls whom non-locals, especially in Whitehall, will take seriously. The effect will be the rise of a new class of subnational politicians with large budgets and, more important, ample street cred. Britain will soon have its own Brandts, Chiracs, Daleys and Giulianis. 
The missing tier of regional government is already being partially filled in by Scotland and Wales. In 2000 the English regions will move, cautiously at first, in the same direction. All the regions now have development agencies and indirectly elected regional chambers or assemblies, representing local authorities, business and the trade unions. Some of them will be content for now to remain talking shops, but at least three-those in the north-east, north-west and southwest-will press for direct elections and substantial powers. 
At Westminster, the House of Commons, never one of the world's more powerful legislatures, will continue to dwindle in importance. Prime minister's question time-always more highly regarded by viewers of America's C-Span than by the folks back home-will continue to provide light entertainment on Wednesday afternoons. (Both the prime minister and the leader of the opposition, if no one else, will continue to take it seriously.) Elsewhere in the Palace of Westminster life will ebb away, with Mrs spending longer and longer weekends in their constituencies, the chamber itself mostly empty and Commons committees influential, if at all, only at the margins. 
The House of Lords, a charming but normally sleepy body, is going to provide Mr Blair and his colleagues with their one serious in-house headache. The Lords, already shorn in 1999 of most of their 600-strong hereditary element, will require in 2000 to be ""reformed"". The government is committed to reform and by January 2000 will have received a royal commission report detailing proposals for change. How the government deals with the commission's report will constitute a major test of its modernising credentials. 
But the biggest single constitutional change of 2000 will occur on Monday October 2nd. On that day, the Human Rights Act, effectively incorporating the European Convention on Human Rights into Britain's domestic law, will come into force. The immediate effect will be to enable British citizens who believe their rights have been violated to litigate in the United Kingdom instead of Strasbourg; but the more significant longterm effect will be to tilt the balance of power in the British system towards the courts. Much litigation under the new act will be aimed directly at the government itself. Moreover, although the courts will not, strictly speaking, be able to strike down acts of parliament, they will have the power to embarrass ministers by pointing to discrepancies between the new act and all existing and future legislation. 
Mr Blair thus sees power slipping away from Whitehall to Scotland, Wales, the courts and the various new regional and local institutions. The House of Lords in its new guise-whatever that turns out to be-is bound to become more assertive. The Eu already acts as an effective check on British ministers. 
Unsurprisingly under the circumstances, Mr Blair will use 2000 to consolidate his hold on what remains-quite a lot-of British central power. Ministers will have to take even more notice than they already do of the views of the Cabinet Office and the Downing Street policy unit, which, taken together, already constitute a prime minister's department in all but name. 
The British constitution used to look like an elegant pyramid, with power supported at the base but exercised at the top. By the end of 2000 it will look more like an unfinished building designed by a slightly dotty architect. 
Anthony King: professor of government at Essex University: election commentator for the eec and regular contributor to the Daily Telegraph.  1999 The British economy is looking more invincible with each month that goes by. Britain used to stagger like a drunken sailor from crisis to crisis, but now it has by far the strongest public finances in Europe. Its monetary arrangements are singled out by the tMF as a model for other European countries. The financial markets apparently share the IMF's confidence in Britain's macroeconomic stability. Sterling has been the world's second strongest currency since 1995 and 30-year interest rates are now lower in Britain than they are in Germany or the United States. 
At first sight this all seems too good to be true. Most people in Britain are natural sceptics. As they survey the state of the British economy, the natural inclination is to wonder whether things can really be as good as they seem. After all, Britain has an unemployment rate second only to America's among the G7 countries. Inflation has been within 0.5% of the government's chosen target throughout the past two years. There ic a cast-iron fiscal position and a universally admired monetary framework. 
All this means that the British economy will continue to do well in the next few years. What is more doubtful is whether it will continue to outperform almost all other oEcD countries as impressively as it has done since 1994. For Britain is now entering the phase of the economic cycle in which performance depends less on the skilful management of monetary and fiscal policy than on the economy's underlying structural strengths. And contrary to widespread belief, it is in macroeconomic management that the British economy has lately been particularly successful, whereas Britain's underlying competitive structure still leaves a lot to be desired. 
Let us begin with the good news. Britain has done extremely well since 1993 by the standard criteria of economic analysis. And, just as it was possible to predict that Britain would cope in 1998 and 1999 with the challenges of the strong pound and the emerging markets' crisis, it can now be said with reasonable confidence that Britain will remain one of the healthiest economies in the world in 2000 and beyond. 
The economy will grow by at least 3% in 2000, pushing it even further up the league of industrialised nations to a position very close to that of France. Interest rates will doubtless rise in the year ahead-perhaps to a level somewhat higher than the 7% currently discounted in financial markets. Inflation will remain very subdued because of a structural upsurge of price competition in many British markets which have been cartelised for decades. 
In the second half of 2000 the pound may retreat a bit against the euro as a result of the widening deficit in the balance of payments and the accelerating recovery in Europe. But any such move should be modest, since the deficit itself is likely to stabilise at around 2% of cDr and then shrink gradually as domestic demand in Europe expands. Moreover, the pound's retreat will probably come after a period of even greater strength. In fact, before the upswing that began in 1996 is over, the pound should test its 1988 high point of DM3.25, equivalent to =L0.60. 
Sitting pretty on a fence 
The strength of the pound, along with the public's ambivalence towards Europe, will ensure that Tony Blair will continue to sit on the fence with regard to European Monetary Union (EMU) as he prepares for the next general election in early 2001. Thus a decision on abolishing the pound and joining the single currency is unlikely to be made in the period immediately after the 2001 election. More probably, the whole question of EMU membership will be put off again until Mr Blair's third parliamentary term, from around 2005 to 2009. Given the time required for a referendum and then to make practical monetary arrangements, Britain seems very unlikely to join the single currency for at least another seven years. For practical purposes, therefore, EMU should probably be ignored as an operative factor. Interestrate decisions in Europe will not have much influence on monetary policies in Britain. Speculation about an entry rate for the pound in ENtu will have less and less impact on currency investors. And prudent businesses should make their decisions on investment and trade with Britain on the assumption that the pound will continue to float. 
This freedom from arbitrary constraints on economic policy should be helpful to Britain. Since there is no reason to believe that the Bank of England and the Treasury will suddenly lose the skills in demand management which they have developed since the mid1990s, Britain should outperform its more constrained European neighbours-especially Germany-when it comes to keeping both unemployment and inflation under good control. 
Having said all this, however, there must now be some serious questions about how long Britain can keep its economic lead, especially as other European countries learn from Britain's successes and start to adopt more active monetary and fiscal policies to manage demand. Once this begins to happen the great irony of the British economic miracle may start to be understood. Britain's economic success is usually attributed to its flexible labour markets, its competitive markets, its strong entrepreneurship and its dynamic, liberal financial sector. But this image of humming efficiency in the supply-side engine room of the British economy does not accord with the country's relatively poor statistics on productivity growth. The truth is that the transformation of Britain's economic performance has so far been due mainly to skilful demand management. The widely discussed improvements in Britain's supply side have been less apparent. 
Productivity growth has hardly accelerated in Britain since the mid-1980s and has continued to lag far behind the rates achieved in Germany and France. That this is not just a statistical illusion is suggested by anecdotal comparisons of market structures and corporate performance in Britain and other countries. Far from being a free-market entrepreneurial paradise, Britain actually seems to suffer from more cartelised markets with much higher prices than the rest of Europe. It has fewer small businesses than other European countries; and the City of London, even though it remains the world's leading centre for international finance, is notably weak in supporting financial innovation within Britain. British-owned companies, in sectors ranging from engineering, chemicals and computer services to retailing, entertainment, banking and insurance, have generally proved weak competitors in global markets. More and more have succumbed to foreign takeovers. The undoubted strength of the economy in 2000 will not disguise the many weaknesses that remain. 
Anatole Kaletsky: columnist on The Times and director of Kaletsky Economic Consulting.  1999 There will be a great effusion of what passes for British warmth and emotion on August 4th 2000, when Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth the Queen Mother turns 100. Unlike the media hype that will go with it, this warmth will be genuine. The Queen Mother is Britain's ""favourite royal"". She has served her country well, most notably standing by her notoriously shy and uncertain husband, King George VI, during the second world war. More recently she has developed the image, with a bright smile and flowery hat, of being everybody's perfect grandmother, or rather, great grandmother. She will be one of about 8,800 Britons to be 100 or over; a reminder of today's longevity. Like all of them she will receive a message of congratulations from her daughter at Buckingham Palace.  1999 Rising crime, hopeless transport, declining services, agricultural crisis-why would anyone want to live in the English countryside? And yet people do: in such large numbers that house-building has become another in the litany of woes afflicting rural areas. According to government calculations, 3.8m new homes must be built in England by 2021 to keep pace with the changing pattern of domestic life. Fine. But nobody has yet solved the question of where to put them. 
On the face of it, it may seem strange that this demand should exist when the British population is more or less stable at 59m. But government demographers base their calculations on changes to the way we live. More and more young people pursue higher education, choosing, in the curious British tradition, universities that are often far away from the parental home. When they finish their studies, they do not return to the nest. Later in life, a third of them will marry and divorce, forcing one partner to set up in a new home. Even the otherwise happy fact that people are living longer has its downside: fewer properties are being released back on to the market through death. Added to these internal changes in demography is the potentially explosive issue of immigration. Official statisticians used to assume that net immigration would fall to zero. Recent figures allow for immigration to rise to an annual net level of 65,000, remaining at that figure until 2036. This alone would create the need for half a million new homes by 2016. Though ministers are loth to discuss such a sensitive matter, and it has generally escaped public attention, the newcomers put extra pressure on the stock of available housing. 
For most of the 1990s, the British domestic property market has been in the doldrums. This has allowed successive governments to put the issue of building new homes from their minds. Building companies were more likely to go bankrupt than embark on ambitious new projects. But in 1999 low interest rates set house prices in southern England fizzing. Soon, no doubt, the chancellor of the exchequer will want to put the cork back into the champagne bottle, but he will find the task even more difficult than did his predecessors if interest rates decline towards European levels. In 2000 prices will probably continue to gush higher, particularly in and around millennium-mad London. House-builders will push hard to be allowed to provide the new homes that are said to be needed, because of the big money to be made from them. The controversial Crow report supports plans to build 1.1m homes in the south-east by 2016. Ashford, Crawley, Milton Keynes and Stansted are targeted for expansion. Councils have vowed opposition. What has been done to ready the planning system for the onslaught? 
The last housing boom came in the early 1980s, when the then Tory government mistakenly believed that the free market would solve the problem. There is not, however, a free market in housing. As a mature country, England and Wales have been subject to planning restrictions since the Middle Ages. By selectively relaxing certain planning controls, the To
ries permitted a rash of low-quality developments, crammed into or around the edges of villages, left floating as detached blobs in the countryside or scrambled into the urban chaos of London's Docklands. 
Margaret Thatcher, when prime minister, had a faith in the motor car as an expression of personal freedom, which meant that many of these 1980s 
developments were inadequately served by public transport. Some ministers of the environment encouraged developers to create new settlements that would provide a large number of dwellings, but they met such public 
resistance that no significant example was actually built. In planning, Thatcherism was a disaster. 
Now, John Prescott, as Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions, is attempting to promote a new vision. Ironically, given that he is a Labour minister and Old Labour at that, many of his ideas were pioneered by the Prince of Wales, who persuaded the Duchy of Cornwall to create the model settlement of Poundbury Farm, on the edge of Dorchester. Poundbury Farm is an attempt to rediscover the pleasure of urban living, with a far higher density of people per acre than the suburban norm. Residential, commercial and public buildings are mixed together, so that nothing should be more than a stroll away. These blessings could be conferred on some of our existing towns, Mr Prescott and his team believe, if more of the derelict land that makes them disfunction could be developed. On coming into office, he boldly announced that two-thirds of the 3.8m new homes would be built on these brown sites. 
Enter Richard Rogers, newly ennobled architect of the Pompidou Centre, the Lloyd's building and other monumenu to a whizzy technological future. Made chairman of an ""Urban Task Force"", he was charged with quantifying the amount of brown land that exists and has not found enough of it. He judges that it could not accommodate more than half the required homes. Furthermore, it is often in the wrong place-plentiful in Sunderland and the other post-industrial towns of the north, scarce in popular and scenic retirement counties such as Devon. The Rogers solution is to promote a vision of urban renaissance, strikingly similar to that of the Prince of Wales's guru, Leon Krier. It may be no coincidence that Lord Rogers is partly Italian and Mr Krier comes from Luxembourg. Both want to persuade the British public to behave more like continentals, for whom vibrant city culture is more fulfiling than rural isolation. The key to it is forcing motor traffic-particularly commuter cars-out of towns. Unfortunately for the urban idealists, Tony Blair gives every sign of being unimpressed. Voters like cars. Middle England is not yet ready to exchange its invincible green suburbs for a Barcelona-style existence. The pressure for house-building exists in the traditionally Tory and Liberal heartlands of the home counties and the south-west. Labour finds the instincts of the people who live in these areas difficult to fathom. In the year ahead, however, it will hear their complaints mounting in volume and anger.  1999 Dogs and cats from Europe will finally be allowed to walk straight through immigration into Britain-passport in paw. 
Will Britons be healthier, wealthier, wiser or happier in 2000? Patterns of social and economic change are rarely obvious to the anecdotal observer from one year to the next. Yet statistics constantly remind us how much we differ from our former selves in family life, work, leisure and the issues that concern us. Rising prosperity, technological progress, the breakdown of traditional social structures and the influence of (often Americanised) media are stealthily turning many of us into new people. But they are also creating new divides, between those who are changing and those who are left behind. 
Take health, for example: awareness of the health implications of diet and exercise rose steadily through the 1990s, and will continue to grow. More hours will be spent in the gym by both men and women, and health club chains will remain a fast-expanding business sector. With concerns about the safety of beef lingering in the consumer's mind (even after most scientists have withdrawn their reservations) we will eat more chicken and less red meat; more fruit and less dairy produce. Food retailers will compete to emphasise the ""naturalness"" of their produce, and the absence of anything genetically modified. Yet obesity-an indication both of rising affluence and of dietary ignorance-will also continue to rise, afflicting more than 20% of adults: more than four women in five will admit to a wish to lose 10kg. 
Smoking will continue to decline among the middle classes, and will become almost universally unacceptable in offices, restaurants and public buildings. Political correctness will rule on this and many other matters (even extending to the suppression of the word ""British"" by the sBC in favour of ""UK diversity""). Yet incorrectness will manifest itself in just as many ways. Smoking will remain prevalent among young working-class women, who will also drink more alcohol than they used to. Influenced by ""laddish"" role models such as radio presenter Zoe Ball (whom 86% of teenage girls in a recent poll identified as the person they would most like to be, even though Ms Ball herself may be taking time off in 2000 to be a wife and mother), young women will increasingly see it as their right to behave as badly as young men. And incidences of ""road rage"" and other forms of in-your-face aggression-perpetrated by both men and women-will continue to rise. 
As for family life, there will be less than half as many first marriages in 2000 as there were a generation ago, and two marriages out of five will be remarriages. More than a quarter of adult women under 50 will be cohabiting. More than a third of all children will be born out of wedlock (four times the number of a generation ago) and in some ethnic minorities more than half; more than six births in a hundred will be to teenage mothers. Perhaps reflected in those statistics are some other measurable trends: more women will be ""economically active"" in 2000 (though many will be working only part-time) but the number of men in any form of work will be in long-term decline. People in all forms of office work will tend to work longer hours (and take shorter lunch breaks) and more people in all kinds of work will be subject to the pressures of being selfemployed, rather than collecting a company wage. 
As a result of all these factors, more than 50% of men will consider themselves, at some time in their lives, to be suffering from stress or depression. Meanwhile, more than half of the population will go through the year without any participation in religious activity. By choice or otherwise, modern Britons will have to fend for themselves with much less in the way of family, corporate or spiritual support. 
Will children suffer from this disintegration of traditional structures? The statistics do not tell us directly, but they do show that the children of 2000 will spend ten times as much time watching television as reading books, and that 15% of them will leave primary school unable to read or write. Yet school test results will almost certainly continue to improve, and 2 1/2 times as many of the youngsters of 2000 as in their parents' generation will go on to university. 
Britons will abide by at least some of their old faiths in 2000. One is football, for which it will be ever more fashionable for the professional classes to display an enthusiasm. The other is bricks and mortar: relatively low mortgage rates combined with rising earnings will fuel a property boom, and ""equity withdrawal"" will continue to fund other kinds of consumer spending-on foreign holidays, electronic gadgetry, exotic eating out and Manchester United season tickets, for example. Reflecting rising wealth, there will be more second homes-many of them in France. The success of socalled ""makeover television"", in programmes such as ""Changing Rooms"" and ""Ground Force"" will fuel a continuing obsession with home improvement. 
In summary, Britain in 2000 will be richer, fitter and more sophisticated in its technology and tastes. In many fields, women will be in the ascendant. But it will also be a lonelier, more atomistic society, in which traditional pillars of support are atrophying away. And it will be divided: the gulf of incomprehension will widen between the wired and the unwired, the made-over and the unreconstructed, the young and the old. Most significantly in political terms, a gulf will widen between rural and urban Britain. Economically disadvantaged farming and village communities, devoted to the old-fashioned pursuits of fox-hunting, church-going and family life, will see themselves as threatened and shunned by self-confident, second-home-owning, mobile-phone-equipped, politically correct townies. That division, stridently expressed, will be the clearest of all illustrations of the changing nature of the Britons of 2000. 
Martin Vander Weyer: associate editor of The Week.  1999 Chris Patten, Europe's new commissioner for external relations, reflects on the lasting strength of liberal ideas. 
The countdown to the millennium has been accompanied by list-making on an heroic scale-best of these, worst of those. Who, for example, have been the greatest thinkers of the century, or the full thousand years? Who has shaped the world, or rather who has shaped it for better, not worse? 
Most of the lists try to balance the political philosophers, economists and leaders of the left against those of the right. Ideas, apparently, have to be served up on the basis of ""on one hand, on the other"". But if we are concerned about ideas that have survived and prospered, why include Marx and his progeny of Socialist divines? 
The totalitarianism of the left, so frequently investing the mad wickedness of tyrants with a spurious intellectualism, has earned its place in the history books by the death, misery and poverty it caused. Modern scholarship has shredded what were once argued to be the modest triumphs of Leninism. 
So who from the left deserves to be garlanded on the grounds of continuing relevance? The Marxist empire whether of ideas or of military occupation-has collapsed in Europe. 
Socialism in Asia has transmuted into the robber-baron capitalism of China. Those British prophets of socialism, Tawney and the Webbs, are no longer the intellectual godparents of Africa's development economists. Where guerrillas and terrorists still breed in jungles and slums, they are more likely to be motivated by ethnic hatred, nasty populism and the ideals of the Mafia than by the ideas of the old left. 
Even the contribution of social democracy-Dick Crosland, Willy Brandt and all those who sought to civilise rather than overthrow capitalism-is today a questionable commodity. In Britain, the Labour Party's makeover signals the death of any attempt to justify a programme of public ownership and redistribution. New Labour and its Third Way (in one American critic's phrase, ""opportunism with a human face""), recognises that policies and ideas that once promoted social solidarity now help produce social alienation. The challenge in a Europe where the jobless queues stretch around the block is how to strip away the regulation and limit the state intervention that have helped to gum up our economies. 
My own chance progress from Hong Kong to Brussels has strengthened my sense that the intellectual survivors of this century are the champions of the liberal order that was born in the last, those who understood the strong and comprehensive relationship between political pluralism and open markets. 
I lived through a time, when governor of Hong Kong, in which some Asian leaders and many of those who invested in their myth, claimed that the liberal order was not universally valid. It was, they asserted, a western cultural import, rendered irrelevant and out of date by the rediscovery of a value system that drew allegedly on Confucius and justified crony capitalism and authoritarian government. 
The Asian miracle was the cocky answer to the democratic activists and the advocates of transparency and clean government. Question the so-called Asian values and you were pointed towards the cranes, the towering office blocks and the marbled hotel lobbies. 
I was lucky to sail away from Hong Kong the day before the Thai baht crashed, the Asian economies tumbled, and the vanities of authoritarians and their business buddies were deflated. One conventional wisdom arrived as rapidly as its predecessor departed. From Seoul to Bangkok, governments and others understood the relationship between political and economic reform. 
Clean financial regulation, openness and the rule of law became Asia's watchwords. The Asian crash and subsequent recovery have reasserted the validity of classical liberal ideas everywhere. 
Europe can't boast 
That is not a bit of western bragging, less still a European crow. Europe's miserable history for too much of the past century has been the story of liberal values trampled in the mud. No European politician can claim that a belief in markets and moderation is distinctively and uniquely associated with our own conduct of political and economic affairs. 
But despite our own apostasy, liberal values did survive in our continentthanks in part to the generous and visionary leadership of the United States, and to the huge success of Europe's evolving Union. When I left Asia, it seemed to me that a main challenge to the Eu would be how much we would be prepared to stand up for and support proponents of the market economy and democracy in Asia. But now I wonder whether our main challenges may not be rather closer to home. 
How are we to respond to the Europe beyond the Union's boundaries, where many nations desire to join the Brussels club precisely because it best exemplifies the liberal order? How are we to rescue the Balkans from irreversible descent into ancient hatreds and future miseries? How can we assist Russia, Ukraine and the other new independent states to build open societies under democratic government. How do we associate the poor countries to our south, along the Mediterranean's shore, with our economic success and political stability? 
What is plain is that we will not be guided philosophically in any of these tasks by the gurus of the left. If we want to know who are likely to be the most influential thinkers of the 21st century, we need look no further than the writers of this century who did most to defend and promote the liberal agenda of the recent past. They have been vindicated. Hayek and Popper, for example, will be of more use during the adventures ahead than any of Socialism's advocates, who will lie forgotten as the millennium turns.  1999 Britain in 2000 will again play host to the world's most exuberant non-stop classical musical festival. The festival has no headquarters, no organisation and no name, but it also has no rivals. Musicloving Brits take it for granted. But foreigners are amazed by it-and increasingly book their tickets from Berlin and Bergamo. 
Pick a date in 2000: say, February 2nd. There is nothing at all special about that date (which happens to be a Wednesday). But that is the whole point. 
On February 2nd the London Philharmonic Orchestra and Emanuel Ax will perform the Brahms D minor piano concerto in London's Royal Festival Hall, followed by a suite from William Walton's score for Laurence Olivier's wartime classic, ""Henry V"". Meanwhile, across the Thames in the Barbican Hall, the London Symphony Orchestra under Pierre Boulez will be playing Boulez's own music together with Stravinsky's Petrushka,the Schoenberg piano concerto (with Daniel Barenboim as soloist) and the world premiere of a new work by the British composer George Benjamin. Anyone not in the mood for orchestral music that night can opt instead for Mitsuko Uchida's piano recital at the Wigmore Hall. 
Opera-lovers are also spoilt for choice on February 2nd. At the newly reopened Royal Opera House, Gianluigi Gelmetti conducts a performance of Otello-no, not the one by Verdi, the much more rarely performed version by Rossini. Less than a mile to the west, at the London Coliseum, the English National Opera that evening will perform another Italian opera-Puccini's La Bohemebut this time in English translation. 
Needless to say, no one planned February 2nd's lush musical offerings. No higher authority decreed which works should be performed or where. Autonomous opera companies, orchestras and impresarios took autonomous decisions. The result will be, as usual, a joyous-and unrivalled-cacophony. An equally wide range of offerings will be available on every evening save one in 2000. Only on December 25th will the national score read tacet. 
Moreover, Britain's year-long festival without a name is not confined to London. Despite Sir Simon Rattle's move to Berlin, the City of Birmingham Symphony Orchestra will continue to flourish in 2000 under its new Finnish conductor, Sakari Oramo. Birmingham's six-yearold Symphony Hall boasts acoustics as fine as any in Europe. 
Further north, Manchester's Bridgewater Hall is home to the city's Halle Orchestra, which fell on hard times during the 1990s but will enjoy a revival in 2000 under its new music director, Mark Elder. Mr Elder is the most experienced of a generation of able British conductors that includes Mark Wigglesworth, Paul Daniel and the young Daniel Harding as well as Sir Simon. 
Opera in the English north will be served in 2000 by the Leeds-based company Opera North, Scotland by Scottish Opera, Wales by the Welsh National Opera, the whole of Britain by Glyndebourne Touring Opera. The ssc maintams orchestras in the north of England, Scotland and Wales as well as the ssc Symphony Orchestra in London. One of the ornaments of Glasgow's cultural life is the Royal Scottish National Orchestra with its Russian conductor, Alexander Lazarev. Another Russian, the violinist Dmitry Sitkovetsky, leads the Ulster Orchestra in Belfast. 
England was once famously dismissed as ""the land without music"", Das Land ohne Musik. England-Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland-will all in 2000 be alive to the sound of music.  1999 In May, on the south side of the Thames, the Tate Gallery will open in the transformed Bankside Power Station. A dramatic home for the Tate's collection of 20th-century art. 
Linking the new Tate with St Paul's Cathedral and the Globe Theatre in Southwark will be the first pedestrian bridge to span the Thames in central London for over a century. It will feel the weight of 4m pairs of feet a year. The British Museum, which attracts some 6m visitors a year, completes a startling renovation with its entire inner courtyard under glass. London's museums have long looked tattier and less loved than their American counterparts. Here, at last, is an improvement. 
Watch out for the arrival of the Gilbert Silver Collection to the newly restored Somerset House (itself a marvel). The gift of Sir Arthur Gilbert, born in London in 1913, the collection, which until recently was on loan to the Los Angeles County Museum of Art, comprises some 800 works. It will be permanently on view as of May. 
The world's largest observation whee and the city's fourth-tallest structure will open; it will sweep the skyline at 135 metres, allowing visitors unrivalled bird's eye views of London and beyond. 
Oh yes, the Millennium Dome. It will open amid much hullabaloo. Some of its displays will be intriguing, some tawdry. But this is not something that will swell Londoners' pride. 
There will be a newly elected mayor. Less expensive than the dome but perhaps as big an eyesore.  1999 The 2000th anniversary of Christianity should give ample opportunity for Catholics and Protestants to be encouraged to renew their faith, as church attendance levels around the world continue to fall. Moreover, the year is also the 26th Holy Year, or Jubilee, for Roman Catholics. Holy Years have been announced every 25 years since 1300. 
Many of the religious plans to celebrate the millennium are overt in their commercialism. Some of the projects endorsed by religious leaders have been unorthodox to say the least. Take, for example, the ""Clean the Slate"" campaign in the United Kingdom, endorsed by the Chief Rabbi and the Bishop of London among others, which aims to have a million sins confessed by the end of the millennium. People of all faiths are asked to send details of their transgressions to a post office box in Oxford, or confess them on radio chat-shows. 
In the Vatican the plans are more high-tech. Catholic organisers hope that 13m credit-card devices will be sold to millennium visitors, which will store credit for a wide range of uses from entry to events to phone calls. But then arrangements in the Vatican need to be very slick to cope with the 30m pilgrims expected to visit the holy city. L5 billion ($8 billion) has been spent on preparations for the millennium. 
For Protestants around the world, June will see the millennial version of the annual ""March for Jesus"". Expect 30m Christians on the streets but little media coverage. They will be happy celebrants, in contrast to the thousands of pilgrims suffering ""messianic madness"" in Israel. The year is so significant that many pilgrims will be expecting the Battle of Gog and Magog, and even the second coming of Jesus. A security unit to deal with such problems has been set up and includes agents from Shin Bet and Mossad. 
Health permitting, the pope plans to visit the Holy Land. This will be the first papal visit since 1964. However, it is likely to stir up old conflicts about the status of the cities in the Holy Land. The Vatican believes that Jerusalem should have special status as a religious centre under international guarantee, a proposition which offends Israelis, who see Jerusalem as the country's eternal and undivided capital. The pope will probably visit Nazareth, also an Israeli city, and Bethlehem, part of the Palestinian self-rule territories. 
The problems of the Church of England-worrying about where to find 35,000 bell-ringers for January 1st and the wording of the service in the Millennium Dome-pale in comparison.  1999 It is always dangerous to proclaim that companies from one particular country are on top. In 1989 a Japanese member of parliament, Shintaro Ishihara, bragged ""There is no hope for the United States."" At the same time, various American academics lauded Japan's tradition of industrial planning. The Harvard Business Review hailed the country's ""unsurpassed"" financial regulators. And a rash of books seemed to imply that most of California would end up as a subsidiary of Matsushita. Since then, Japan's share of the world's stockmarket capitalisation has shrunk from 40% to around a tenth. 
Nowadays the same air of invincibility surrounds American companies. ""Dot.com"" books with pictures of T-skirted geeks have taken the place of all those worthy tributes to kaizen. Flexibility, speed, inventiveness, ruthlessness are just a few of the virtues that are deemed to be innately American. In Fortune's annual list of the world's most admired companies, the top ten firms in 1999 all came from the United States; and there were only three non-Americans-Sony, Toyota and DaimlerChrysler-in the top 25. 
Has everybody got it wrong again? The broad answer is no. Even if you think that the American stockmarket is overvalued, even if you are sceptical about the ""new economy"", American firms are still, by most measures of competitiveness, beating the Bejesus out of their peers. Yet there are a few signs in Europe (and to a lesser extent in Japan) that firms are beginning to learn how to fight back. To paraphrase Winston Churchill, the coming year may not be the beginning of the end of American domination; but it might just be the end of the beginning. 
Start with the presumption that in business, even more than politics, the only constant thing is change. One method by which American firms caught up with their Japanese peers (assuming that they were ever behind in the first place, which is another debate) was by copying them. All those books about total quality management and lean production had an effect. Can the Europeans and Japanese catch up too? Today, the superiority of the Americans is evident but it is not universal. There are a few industries (luxury goods, for instance, in the case of Europe; consumer electronics for Japan) where the Americans are still behind. And in some ""neutral"" geographic territories, non-Americans are also doing pretty well. Japanese firms have a strong position in developing Asia, European ones in Latin America. 
The Americans are ahead overall because, first, they are leaner than their peers; and, second, they have embraced new technology. Buoyed by fads like re-engineering, American firms spent much of the early 1990s slimming not just their blue-collar workforce but also their managerial ranks; and they have kept on slimming and outsourcing jobs to other places. By contrast, in Europe and Japan, companies have, depending on your point of view, been kinder, lazier, unfairly restrained by their governments or simply true to their stakeholder principles. Although sales growth in Europe has broadly kept pace with America, profit margins in continental Europe are roughly half those in America. 
But there are signs of change. Already investment bankers are talking about European firms taking a much more aggressive, ""American"" approach to mergers and acquisitions. Certainly, European giants such as Daimler-Benz (now DaimlerChrysler) and Fiat that might once have considered themselves invulnerable, have begun to lop off ""noncore"" operations. Shareholder activism is on the rise in Europe; so is performancerelated pay. 
American firms have always been able to sell to 250m people on their doorstep. Now, thanks to the single market and the single currency, European firms should be able to reap similar economies of scale. Compared with America, Europe has twice as many car makers, eight times as many rail-engine manufacturers and ten times as many tractor and battery makers. 
Ten years ago there was much talk about how Japanese firms had a technological edge over the West. That now seems laughable. Not only do American firms dominate most of the well-known high-tech industries like computers, biotechnology and software, but even in more humdrum industries, like plastics and construction, American companies have been quicker to embrace both the Internet and e-commerce. 
But Europe in particular is not without hope. In pharmaceuticals, the continent is America's equal. There are a few parts of the continent-Finland for instance-that are actually more wired than America. And in one increasingly crucial technology, wireless telephony, Europe enjoys a sizable lead, thanks to firms like Nokia, Ericsson and VodafoneAirtouch, and the pervasiveness of the GsM standard. Europe and Japan, which is also ahead of America, will be the first two markets to introduce a common global standard. As the Internet migrates to ""smart"" hand-held devices, that could give the non-Americans a spur. 
Continental Europe is a morass of interfering regulators, high taxes and inflexible rules. Even were a French business leader to emerge who had the technological brain of Bill Gates and the restructuring zeal of Jack Welch, what could he or she do to get round the country's new 35-hour week? Or the Eu's social charter? 
These rules have long been the American businessman's best friend. European leaders like to insist that the shackles are coming off-even in Paris ""regulation"" has become something of a dirty word-but there is a need to hurry. The consultants at McKinsey reckon that only a fifth of world output, or $6 trillion out of $28 trillion, is at present globally contestable-that is, open to global competition in products, service or ownership. But within 30 years, as various economies (for example, China and India) and industries (retail and financial services) open up, four-fifths of the world economy will be global. That is the prize that the rest of the world's business leaders need to try and wrest away from American companies. But they had better get a move on. 
John Micklethwait: New York bureau chief, The Economist. Co-author, ""A Future Perfect: The Essentials of Globalisation"". published in 2000.  1999 It will be a bruising year for car companies, which are still the mainstay of manufacturing industry in most countries: a time of profitless prosperity. And as car companies go, so may go many others. They will have to cope both with a normal cyclical downturn in the market in most countries, and with the need to reinvent themselves. Expect more mergers to mop up excess capacity: the merger of Daimler and Chrysler has already triggered Renault's fusion with Nissan and Ford's purchase of Volvo. The ways in which cars are made, distributed and sold will also change. New forms of propulsion are being developed that might one day replace the internal combustion engine. And the vehicles themselves are becoming more complex, with more niche products, cars that no longer fit into simple categories. 
The long boom in America, which will see record sales of more than 17m cars and light trucks in 1999 (up from the previous 1986 record of 16.2m), is coming to an end. The huge market in minivans (an odd name for vehicles that look like bungalows on wheels), beloved by Americans, is weakening. Europe's record sales of 16m surprised the industry in 1999. Most companies think the market will fall in 2000, putting further pressure on their slim profit margins. In Japan there is no end to the stagnation that has hurt all the manufacturers. And Brazil is going from bad to worse, racking up losses for the global car companies that have piled billions into new factories there, in the hope of riding the surge in car sales that goes with rapid economic development. Tight credit and high interest rates have wrecked the car market as the government struggles to stabilise the economy after the crisis that began in 1998. 
Outside the special case of Brazil, the market problems are most acute in Europe. There is a basic 30% over-capacity in the European market. Features such as air conditioning, electronic brakes and suspension control are now becoming standard even in small, inexpensive cars, whereas ten years ago they were confined to executive models. European prices have been slipping by about 2.5% a year, enough to swallow improvements in productivity. 
Only DaimlerChrysler and Volkswagen are making decent profits. General Motors and Ford are barely making money on their huge European sales. Fiat is actually losing money. All this will get worse in 2000. Growing consumer resistance to high prices in Britain (estimated to be about a fifth higher than continental markets) is spurring the European Commission to scrutinise ""block exemption"", the system that permits car makers to restrict sales to exclusive dealer networks, thus enabling them to keep prices high. When the exemption expires in 2002, it is unlikely to be renewed. So expect car prices in Europe to edge down, especially as the euro promotes transparency and makes for a regional single market. In Britain both Volkswagen and Ford, faced with customers waiting for prices to fall, have had to promise to reimburse customers for any cuts that take place after their purchase. 
The consolidation that started with DaimlerChrysler will continue in Europe and in Asia. General Motors gets ever closer to absorbing Daewoo, a bankrupt South Korean manufacturer. Fiat and Psn Peugeot Citroen are the two European companies most likely to be absorbed by bigger groups before the end of 2000. Car companies need to have sales of around 4m-5m a year to benefit from economies of scale. This is the strategy that has made Volkswagen so successful in recent years: it is now twice the size of Fiat or Peugeot. In a sense, being global does not matter in itself; it just happens to be the best way to reach the right size. 
As for the predators, both Ford and DaimlerChrysler are on the prowl again. Daimler will probably snap up Peugeot. Ford is renewing its interest in Fiat as a way out of losses in its medium and small cars in Europe. General Motors has been studying a proposal to buy a stake in Fiat's car division and pool its operations with GM Europe. Neither of these American giants can sustain the slim pickings they earn in the European market these days. 
After dithering about it for some time, car companies-especially in America-are waking up to the fact that the Internet will have a big impact on retailing. That is why they are rushing to shorten the order-to-delivery time as customers increasingly want to specify the options and colour from information on a website (after taking a virtual test drive) and then nip round to a local showroom to pick up the keys in a couple of weeks. If car companies can master this, each vehicle on an assembly line will be customised for the buyer; rather in the way Dell Computers does with personal computers. 
Another change comes from manufacturing: Audi is launching a new small car built on a sort of ""space frame"", which amounts to clipping together stressed lengths of aluminium, giving the car its strength, rather than relying on a body shell. The impact of this technology is to permit small production runs. 
Watch out for new types of vehicles in 2000 that are impossible to categorise. For example, Ford's biggest minivan, the Lincoln Navigator, is also a luxury vehicle; likewise the startling rT Cruiser that DaimlerChrysler launches in the spring can either be seen as one of those old ""woody"" American station wagons or as a roomy saloon car that converts into a multi-purpose vehicle. Toyota's revolutionary hybrid Prius model, already selling well in Japan and coming to America and Europe in the summer, is also a new type of vehicle. It runs off a battery electric motor in town to cut pollution and uses a small petrol engine on the open road or to charge the battery. Fewer fumes and fewer companies-the future of the car industry becomes a little less foggy in 2000. 
Iain Carson: industry editor, The Economist.  1999 What exactly do sexy technologies like Internet links and solar-energy panels have to do with petrol stations, the grimy watering holes of the Industrial Age? At face value, nothing. Yet you will see both technologies spread like wildfire across the retail petrol outlets of some of the world's biggest oil companies in 2000. The reasons behind this explain why Big Oil is in big trouble, and suggest an early, if still hazy, outline of the energy industry of the next century. 
The upheaval that traumatised the oil industry in 1999 will continue in 2000, though not for the reason that some suspect. Many have pointed to the roller-coaster ride that oil prices have taken of late, bouncing between $10 and $25 a barrel, as the reason for the merger frenzy that produced the marriages of Exxon with Mobil, Br with Amoco and Arco, and TotalFina with Elf. Yet the price of oil is less important than it seems. 
This is because two forces much more powerful than the fickle oil price are driving the restructuring: the rise of markets, and growing public alarm over global warming. These twin forces are already beginning to transform petroleum from the world's most strategic asset into just another commodity; in time, they may even make it yesterday's fuel. 
To see why, consider an experiment with the first of those two sexy technologies. In America, sr intends to offer some customers who pump their own petrol Internet information, such as weather, road conditions and area maps. The reason companies want to do this is to control costs. Such technology will make pumps so smart that they can re-order petrol as they are about to run out or e-mail for help as things go wrong. 
The pressure to cut costs in the oil industry will only increase as institutional shareholders clamour for better returns: oil shares have had the worst total returns on investor capital of any major industrial sector in the 1990s. It is precisely such pressure that is making the dinosaurs of Big Oil dance so nimbly. While no new colossus the size of Exxon Mobil can emerge, look for the consolidation to continue in 2000 among the mid-sized players like Chevron, Texaco and Eni. 
Get ready too for a fire sale. In addition to merging like mad, firms of all sizes will shed peripheral assets in a desire to convince investors that they will stick to their knitting. Others will sell assets under orders from anti-trust authorities. The big winners will be the nimble entrepreneurs and businesses who could become serious competitive threats to the oil majors. For example, look for firms such as PetroPlus in Europe to expand in refining (ar is one to watch for big disposals in that area), and expect Dow Chemical in America to gobble up speciality chemicals units (as Shell and TotalFina-Elf hive off petrochemicals). The few oil companies that still have some coal assets, such as Exxon Mobil, are also likely to dump these soon. 
Green Giants? Another factor that will transform the oil business in 2000 is growing concern over the environment. At one level, environmental concern is propelled by the Kyoto protocol on global warming, a treaty signed in 1997 that commits the developed economies to make cuts in carbon emissions. This treaty is not just un fluff: it might prove to be the death knell for those oil and coal producers that do not change their ways. 
Government negotiators are due to meet in late 2000 at a follow-up summit to Kyoto in order to hammer out details. It is likely that the Clinton administration, preoccupied with the presidential election in November and fearful of the anti-Kyoto Republican Senate, will push for a postponement of the gathering. But, even if America succeeds, public concern will ensure that global warming stays on the minds of oil bosses. 
That is why they will make big investments in 2000 in cleaner technologies. Natural gas, which is much cleaner than coal or oil, will attract the lion's share of investment. Demand for gas is forecast to grow twice as fast as that for oil over the next decade. A big spur to this dash for gas will be the progressive liberalisation of the gas and electricity markets in Europe and America in 2000. Indeed, the two markets are fast converging in America and in Britain; this will accelerate through ever freer international trading of power. This coming liberalisation will drive some oil companies, in particular Shell and Texaco, to build a bigger presence in power generation. One may even gobble up a big power company during 2000. Watch too for the more adventurous oil giants to venture into the thorny retail gas and electricity game. The European Commission has ordered Eu countries to allow their biggest electricity customers free choice of supplier. In 2000, gas markets will be thrown open. 
The Kyoto treaty is changing the rules of oil in a broader sense too. Markets are already beginning to accept that the aims of Kyoto, if not the terms of the treaty itself, are inevitable. The result has been a flurry of voluntary schemes by companies and national governments to reduce emissions and encourage carbon trading. The result could be that the aims of the Kyoto treaty may well be achieved by a more market-friendly means, than if the politicians forge ahead with a heavy-handed accord. 
Some energy companies will even begin investing heavily in renewable technologies like fuel cells. DaimlerChrysler, Ford and Toyota promise to bring zero-emission fuel-cell cars to market as soon as 2004. As fantasy fast approaches market reality, look for oil companies to invest in rival fuel infrastructure, ranging from methanol to hydrogen to ""clean"" petrol. Oil companies will also increase investments in forestry for biomass energy, and wind power. One scenario that Shell is contemplating is that half of the firm's revenues will come from renewable energy by 2050. 
If that sounds implausible, consider the curious sight of solar panels popping up on top of BP and Shell petrol stations. Why in the world are the biggest purveyors of petrol exposing exactly how filthy their fuel is by installing clean, green solar panels? The reason is that they have already figured out what the rest of Big Oil will begin to realise in 2000: that the rise of greenery, Kyoto or not, spells bad news for those who refuse to embrace cleaner technologies. Small wonder, then, that sr has become the world's biggest solar-power company. 
Vijay Vaitheeswaran: environment and energy correspondent, The Economist.  1999 Still in swaddling clothes at the start of the century, the telecoms industry now feels itself prepared to dominate our lives in the next. Yet 2000 will see the industry's confidence sorely tested. In particular, the telecoms industry's ability to buy its way out of trouble or into new markets is increasingly in doubt: this despite the fact that the stockmarket capitalisation of the industry worldwide is in excess of $1 trillion. 
The primary issue-half opportunity, half threat-is ""convergence"". The term refers to the elision between once-distinct telecoms technologies-the conventional fixed telephone and the newer mobile variety or the public switched telephone network (PSTN) and the Internet. But it also applies to the industrial meshing of the telecoms sector with the worlds of IT, media and entertainment. 
The phrase most commonly used to describe the convergence process to date is ""a blurring of distinctions"" between technologies and industries. Those likely to prosper in 2000 will be those who are able to see things with pin-sharp clarity. 
On paper, the traditional telephone companies are well-placed to operate on all three fronts. Building on their traditional dominance of fixed telephony, they were among the pioneers of mobile services and were only slightly late in arriving on the Internet scene. For most old-style operators, the growth in mobile-telephone and Internet revenues has obscured the rapid decline in traditional telephone revenues, which followed the introduction of competition in developed markets in the second half of the 1990s. These companies were able to buy into the Internet and mobile-phone markets thanks only to the streams of profits from standard wired-phone networks. 
As these funds dry up or disappear, a question mark hangs over the ability of these companies to sustain their assaults on newer markets. Their war chests are not yet empty, but it is becoming increasingly difficult to see how they will replenish them the next time around. 
Events in 2000 will show the way. Far from attempting to create converged companies capable of satisfying custourer requirements in telephony, mobiles and the Internet as a ""one-stop shop"", many major players will seek to spin off their mobile and Internet arms as separate entities. This would enable these operating divisions to raise muchneeded investment capital and to prune costs to levels nearer the ""leaner and meaner"" upstarts they face. 
Although sound, this strategy raises two questions. First, what becomes of the ancient parent, left only with a dwindling share of a fixed telephony market whose profitability is in steady decline? Second, what if the world's tech-obsessed bourses lose their appetites for telecoms and Internet shares before separate subsidiaries can be floated? 
The second question concerns new and old carriers alike. Outside the United States, there are still billions of dollars to be released in government-held equity in the old national telephone companies. Added to this, 2000 will see repeated calls on the world's markets for cash-raising bonds, capital enlargements and loans. Much of the planned expansion in fields such as mobile phones and the Internet has been predicated on the ready access to such funding. 
These cash calls are not getting any lighter. Take mobile phones: the nextgeneration wireless networks are set to be licensed in 2000 in most big countries. Whether or not we witness a stampede for these so-called ""3G"" licences-for a technology supporting mobile access to voice, data, the Internet and video-will depend on whether would-be bidders believe capital will be available to build these new networks. 
This is an important point. Ahead of the commercial launch of 3G networks-- due in 2002-existing cellular networks will become more and more able to support the needs of an information-hungry population. Expect routine e-mail access and the ability of mobile users to ""surf' stripped-down versions of web pages from their handsets to gain prominence in 2000. Given the current growth in the cellular market-which should see a staggering 70% of the populations in the Nordic region owning a cellphone in 2000-there is a risk that 3G systems will be obsolete before they are off the ground. 
Jim Chalmers: editor, Public Network Europe.  1999 The gadget of choice for children of all ages-especially well-heeled ones in their 30s and up-is going to be Sony's new video-game machine. With a graphics engine capable of generating 75m polygons (the basic unit of 3D models) per second, PlayStation2 has five times the power of today's most powerful graphics workstations. But what makes PlayStation2 a natural winner is that it is not simply a videogame console. Apart from being able to play video games on discs with frighteningly realistic graphics and even download new games from the Internet, it can double as a DVD movie and CD audio player. Expect to see PlayStation2 being used as much for downloading and playing movies as for zapping aliens. When? The new Sony game machine hits the Japanese market on March 4th with a price tag of Y39,800 ($370). The rest of Asia will see it during the summer, while America and Europe will have to wait until the autumn. And fast on its heels will come the new Nintendo console, to be called Dolphin. 
The portable video phone will finally be coming to a shop near you. Kyocera has been selling its tiny VisualPhone VP-210 in Japan since May 1999. With its built-in video camera and screen, the portable phone allows a person to see who he or she is talking to, while being seen as well as heard in return. Kyocera's handset weighs a mere 165 grams and has a recommended price of 40,000. Orange, a. British cell-phone company, plans to go one better when it launches its as-yet unnamed wireless video phone-cum-pocket organiser this summer. Its touch-screen can recognise and transmit handwriting as well as let the user download e-mail and surf the Internet. The pocket-sized gizmo can send and receive video phone calls as well. 
The most politically correct form of private transport is going to be the hybrid car. Since launching its little Prius model in December 1997, Toyota has surprised everyone (including itself by selling 30,000 of these part-petrol, part-electric cars that get nearly 80 miles to the metric gallon. Honda has now gone one better with a hybrid called Insight that does 100 miles per gallon-and will soon be coming down your road soon. 
Pocket-sized digital cameras have been around since Casio shook the photographic world with its nifty little QV10 five years ago. But it had only 350,000 pixels (picture elements) per frame against photographic film's millions. Now Japan's digital camera makers are introducing ""mega-pixel"" models. These produce images with a lifelike 2m-3m pixels. Canon's PowerShot SlO costs Y89,900.

More and more large corporations will get into the venture-capital business in the years ahead. Is this an oxymoron? Can an established company take the risks and spare the management to invest in start-ups? Unequivocally the answer is yes. In an era when many large firms are questioning the productivity of their investments in traditional R&D laboratories, venture organisations represent an intriguing alternative. 
Much of this interest is being stimulated by the recent success of independent venture-capitalism: for example, the rapid growth of capital under management and the spectacular returns of many funds in recent years. Although total disbursements from the venture industry over the past two decades have been far less than the R&D spending of either isNt or General Motors, the economic successes of venture-backed firms-such as Intel, Microsoft, Yahoo, Genentech and Cisco Systems-have been profound. As a result, several hundred corporate-venture programmes have been established over the past three years to invest in entrepreneurial ventures, whether in spin-outs of internal concerns or in entities outside the firm. Although American and Japanese corporations have taken the lead, European companies-including France Telecom, Reuters and Siemens-are becoming increasingly active as well. 
In the excitement about the current surge of corporate venture-capital activity, it is easy to lose sight of the fact that similar programmes have existed in the past. The first corporate funds began in the mid-1960s. These corporate efforts were spurred by the successes of the first private venture-capital funds, which had backed such firms as Digital Equipment, Memorex, Raychem and Scientific Data Systems. Intrigued by this success, large companies began establishing divisions that emulated venture capitalists. But in 1973, the market for new public offerings-the primary avenue through which venture capitalists exit successful investments-abruptly declined. 
A relaxation of the rules allowing pension funds to invest and an increase in the number and strength of independent venture capitalists attracted big corporations back into the business in the 1980s. By 1986 corporate funds managed $2 billion, or nearly 12% of the total pool of venture capital. After the stockmarket crash of 1987, however, corporations scaled back: by 1992 the number of corporate venture programmes had fallen by one-third and their capital represented only 51 of the venture pool. 
These patterns have led many to conclude that corporate venture-capital is inherently unstable, and unlikely to be successful. In order to test this criticism, we examined over 30,000 investments in entrepreneurial firms by venture-capital organisations in the VentureOne database of private equity financings. Far from being outright failures, corporateventure investments in entrepreneurial firms appear to be at least as successful (using such measures as the probability of a portfolio firm going public) as those backed by independent venture organisations. 
But success is not uniform. The success of the corporate programmes is particularly pronounced for investments in which there is strategic overlap between the corporate parent and the portfolio firm. The success of investments when there is no overlap is much lower. Similar patterns emerge when the duration of the corporate programmes themselves is examined: the empirical evidence suggests that corporate programmes without a strategic focus are less stable than those of independent funds. The programmes frequently cease operations after only a few investments. Corporations with a strong strategic focus are almost as stable as independent funds. These insights are corroborated by field-based research. Corporate-venture managers can select higher quality firms in related industries, and then more effectively add value to these firms afterwards. This is more difficult when the portfolio company is in an industry far removed from that of the parent corporation. 
Why did corporations invest in areas that they did not know well in the first place? The diffuse nature of unsuccessful programmes appears to have reflected internal dissension about the programmes' goals. In many cases, important segments of the corporation, such as the legal department or R&D personnel, were uncomfortable with the programme and sought to restrict it to investing in areas where the corporation had few competing operations. In other instances, senior executives had inflated expectations about how rapidly widely dispersed investments could affect corporate profitability. 
Corporations will come under growing pressure to rethink their innovation plans. The enormous surge in venture-financing, the success of these firms in creating market value, will make corporate venture-capital programmes part of the tool kit for major corporations around the world.  1999 The need for management development has never been more pressing. The world is awash with money but short on the talent needed to meet the combined challenges of globalisation, new technologies and an increasingly entrepreneurial culture. If capitalism is to be democratised through more and more small and medium enterprises, the engines of employment growth, then we can no longer afford good-quality management education to be accessible only to a privileged few. This is a matter of national competitiveness. 
But to serve the boardroom of the multinational, management education must also change. The profile of the successful corporate leader grows ever more complex. The ideal chief executive in 2000 has to be global in perspective yet willing to sweat over the details. He or she must be entrepreneurial yet also be a team player; able to articulate a vision, yet flexible enough to change the strategy whenever necessary. 
Can the businessschool industry, invented in the United States around 100 years ago, foster such new and diverse talents? The robust new insights to guide and frame management practice still flow primarily from academics at the leading schools. But corporate leaders in future will be more likely to cherrypick the ideas of individual academic gurus than adopt the overall intellectual leadership of a particular academic brand. In addition, many good ideas are flowing from the very consultants whom the top business schools trained. Independent-minded academics are not always as inclined as consultants to team up and tackle the really big problems. 
A second strength of business schools is that fast-growing knowledge businesses, including consulting firms, investment banks and high-tech companies, remain heavy recruiters of MBAs. The business schools have done the screening for them. But, increasingly, industrial firms are being priced out of the MBA market at the top schools. In future more companies will turn to talented BA graduates and put them through in-house training programmes. At Motorola, British Aerospace and many other leading multinationals, training can lead to MBA degrees in their own corporate universities. This is the fastest-growing segment of the management development market. 
To retain their premium status, the top business schools will have to attract top faculty talent. A continuous flow of new ideas and a community that fosters creativity are the lifeblood of any academic institution. As in any other industry, business schools need a clear positioning in the marketplace. 
Most business schools do not develop important new ideas but, acting as metoo competitors, repackage the ideas of others at lower prices. Most are in fact training and thinly veiled consulting organisations. The barriers to entry are minimal; a warm body and a chalkboard and you have a business school. There are well over 100 MBA programmes in the United Kingdom and the accreditation process to provide some modest quality control cannot keep pace. However, the demand for management education is burgeoning and, although some of the MBAs granted may not be worth much, not everyone can go to one of the top schools. 
Internet delivery of management training promises to expand the market further. The virtual University of Phoenix has more MBAs enrolled than any other university in the United States. For basic skills training in subjects such as accounting, finance and quantitative methods, distance learning may be feasible. 
But for those softer skills in human resources management, leadership and team-building, face-to-face interaction among students and faculty will remain essential to the learning process. 
The top business schools will use Internet delivery and study groups connected by email to supplement on-site coursework in their part-time or executive MBA programmes. However, there will always be a market for the full-time MBA among bright twenty-somethings who want to take time out to take stock of their career path, brush up on the latest thinking, perhaps develop a business plan for a start-up, and become a member of a global alumni network. But, if Internetdelivered management education develops further, will the quality gap close to the point that the higher prices charged by the traditional business schools are no longer sustainable? 
Recalling the famous case-study on Japanese Honda's entry into the United States motorcycle market, the relative indifference of the top business schools to the virtual MBA is reminiscent of HarleyDavidson's unfortunate smugness. Could the virtual University of Phoenix be today's academic equivalent of the Honda motorcycle of 1965?

For today's bosses there is nothing more shaming than appearing not ""to get"" the Internet. When Oracle's Larry Ellison proclaims that ""the Internet changes everything"" or Intel's Andy Grove warns that in five years' time ""all companies will be Internet companies or they won't be companies at all"", few dare to disagree. But what is it that they are agreeing with? What kind of industrial revolution are they suddenly so desperate to embrace? 
Between 1995 and 1997, when the World Wide Web began emerging as a mass market platform, interest in the Internet as a business opportunity was focused on its potential as a marketing tool and an additional, low-cost distribution channel. Pioneers, such as Dell Computer, also showed that for some companies it could offer a more direct way of reaching customers, cutting out middlemen and resellers who didn't add much value. But if that was interesting for many (and alarming for a few), it was not yet truly compelling. While most media attention was on the glamorous consumer side of the web-content and shopping-and on the gravity-defying share prices of upstart Internet firms such as Amazon.com and Yahoo!, serious, grown-up businesses appeared to be biding their time. 
But no longer. The Internet is beginning to turn mainstream business upside down and inside out. It is fundamentally changing the way many companies operate, most obviously in high-tech, but even in metal-bashing industries. And web-based transactions-buying and selling over the Internet-are only the tip of a massive and expanding iceberg. While some companies are indeed using the Internet to deal directly with their customers for the first time, others are using the Internet's reach and ubiquity to intensify relationships with trading partners, request quotes or liquidate surplus inventory by auction. 
The Internet is making it possible for companies to lower costs dramatically across their supply-and-demand chains, take customer service to undreamed-of new levels, enter markets from which they were previously excluded by geography, create new revenue streams and ultimately redefine the very nature of their business. Entirely new companies are appearing in industries ranging from advertising to road haulage to chemicals. Using the connectivity of the Internet, these ""infomediaries"" create super-efficient electronic marketplaces, bringing together buyers and sellers who previously could not find each other. 
Although limelight-hogging consumer e-commerce is growing fast, it is as nothing compared with both the speed and the absolute amount of intercompany trade in goods over the Internet. Forrester Research, a technology consultancy, reckons that whereas business-to-consumer e-commerce in America (still the most ""wired"" country by some way) will go from $8 billion last year to $108 billion in 2003, business-tobusiness e-commerce will surge from $43 billion to $1.3 trillion in the same period. Forrester expects Britain and Germany to go into the same ""hypergrowth"" stage of e-business about two years after America, with Japan, Italy and France a further two years behind. 
And just as countries are moving towards e-business hyper-growth at slightly different paces, so too are industries. Unsurprisingly, computing and electronics adopted and evangelised the Internet first and are therefore already well on the way to achieving critical mass. But aerospace, telecoms and the car industry are also undergoing massive Internetdriven change and are not far behind. The same is true of other industries, such as financial services, that have appropriate systems-integration skills and have invested heavily in the right kind of iT infrastructure. 
While nimble Internet start-ups are a ceaseless source of business model innovation and have been responsible for giving established giants a nerve-jangling wake-up call (one that rang worryingly late in some boardrooms), it is big companies with real financial and market heft that are now providing the main traction for e-business. Lou Gerstner, the head of IBm, likes to describe the new ""dot.com"" firms as ""fireflies before the storm-all stirred up, throwing off sparks."" According to Mr Gerstner, the storm that is now arriving is ""when the thousands and thousands of institutions that exist today seize the power of this global computing and communications infrastructure and use it to transform themselves. That's the real revolution."" 
Mr Gerstner may have a prejudice in favour of big companies. After all, he runs one of the biggest in the world. But he is right. When a Ford, a Wal-Mart, a BancOne or General Electric (GE) turns itself into an e-business, it is an event that reverberates. Traditionally, IT investments have been inward-looking, concentrated on making each enterprise more efficient in isolation. By contrast, the Internet is all about communicating, connecting and transacting with the outside world. With e-business, the benefits should come not just from speeding up and automating one's own internal processes, but from extending those efficiency gains to suppliers and customers. 
When a really large company, at considerable cost in terms of both money and upheaval, moves some or all of its operations to the web, it puts its trading partners under intense pressure to do the same. Suppliers, and even some customers, who insist on continuing to trade the old-fashioned way will get frozen out, while those that make the effort will win more of the available business. 
And that effort involves more than just iT spending: it is cultural too. No longer can any business see itself as a more or less free-standing entity. It must become part of an e-business ecosystem in which firms that trade with each other use the Internet to allow their partners and customers to enter deep into their internal systems and processes. To reap the rewards of a truly integrated value chain requires a degree of openness and flexibility that comes naturally to few firms. As an executive at Cisco Systems, the dominant supplier of networking gear that many regard as the ultimate ebusiness, puts it, ""You have to be ready to open the kimono."" 
That in turn may mean radically reappraising what your company does or even is. Jack Welch has put ""dyb.com""destroyyourbusiness-teams into every one of GE's operating units to force the Internet revolution through the huge firm. Ford is giving serious consideration to outsourcing all its manufacturing, stripping the company down to its essentials of product development, brand management and customer service. Others will follow. software as a service to be paid for. Another booming sector will be industry portals and hubs. For more than a decade, multinationals have been investing billions of dollars in complex systems designed to automate their internal inventory, sales and supply-chain operations. The hardest part has been bringing their business partners-suppliers, customers, service providersinto the loop: the cacophony of different technologies and data formats is too much for most to bear. The Internet has become the great mediator: the largest single barrier-connectivity-disappears; hubs will emerge in industry clusters to provide a lingua franca for sharing data, from product and price lists to shipping information. 
The aim of this is not so much to help companies sell more goods, but to lower the cost of doing so. This will change the economic shape of the industry. From a race between speedy start-ups to capture new consumer markets, it will become a battle of titans as large, established firms in everything from manufacturing to accounting try to use the Internet to gain advantage over their competitors. The new companies that arise will be those that help companies do this best, whether by providing software, services or a marketplace. A slowing stockmarket will leave scars, but the amount of money available for Internet ventures will remain huge: this is an industrial revolution, not a tulip bubble, and good investors always knew that supernormal capitalisations could not last. 
The other technology trends of the year will all stem from the Internet. Mobile phones using the Wireless Application Protocol will hit the streets of Europe, Asia and America, bringing web access, e-mail, even banking to pocket-sized devices. This is the first big step towards the emergence of handheld devices, from personal digital assistants to smart phones, as a rival to the rc for the Internet throne. Sony's PlayStation2 will mark the rise of the consumer-electronics industry as the rc's other competitor. While the rc will improve and become more popular, this is no longer a one-box game. 2000 will be the year when the seeds of something bigger begin to sprout. 
All new American Ns will have V-Chip technology allowing parents to block undesirable programmes. 
Matthew Symonds: IT and communications editor, The Economist.  1999 Peter Drucker, the grand old man of management science, predicts an unlikely twist that e-commerce will give to every business. 
Traditional multinationals will, in time, be killed by e-commerce. The ecommerce delivery of goods, of services, of repairs, spare parts and maintenance, will require a different organisation from that of any multinational today. It will also require a different mindset, a different top management and, in the end, different definitions of performance. Indeed, the very way performance is measured will change. 
In most businesses today delivery is considered a ""support"" function, a routine to be taken care of by clerks. It is taken for granted unless something goes 
dramatically wrong. But under e-commerce delivery will become the one area in which a business can truly distinguish itself. It will become the critical ""core competence"". Its speed, quality and responsiveness may well become the decisive competitive factor even where brands seem to be entrenched. And there is no existing multinational and altogether very few businesses which are organised for it. Very few yet even think that way. 
The railway, invented in 1829, mastered distance. This explains why, more than any other of the inventions of the industrial revolution, the railway changed every nation's economy and workforce. It changed humanity's mindset, its horizon, its ""mental geography"". 
E-commerce does not merely master distance, it eliminates it. There is no reason why, under e-commerce, the vendor has to be in any particular place. In fact, the customer as a rule does not know and does not care where the ecommerce vendor is located. And the ecommerce vendor in turn, for example Amazon.com, today the world's biggest book seller, neither knows nor cares where the purchase order comes from. 
If the purchase is itself electronic information-a software program or a trade on a stockmarket-there is no delivery problem. The ""product"" itself is, after all, only an entry in a computer memory. It has a legal but no physical existence. (There is, however, a considerable tax problem with this type of trade in electronically delivered goods, which will give the world's tax authorities a headache in 2000. The intelligent ones will drop such taxes, the unintelligent ones will devise nonsense rules of control.) 
If the purchase is a book, there is still not much of a delivery problem. Books ship easily, have high value-toweight ratios and pass without much trouble across national boundaries and through customs. But a tractor has to be delivered to where the customer is and it can neither be delivered electronically nor by parcel post. 
Delivery also seems to be needed for newspapers and magazines, that is, for the carriers of printed information. At least, none of the attempts made so far to sell an ""on-line"" edition to be read on the subscriber's computer or ""downloaded"" from it, has been a great success. Subscribers want their paper delivered to the doorstep. 
Medical diagnosis and test results are increasingly being put on the Internet. But practically everything to do with sickness care-from the physician's examination to surgery, medication and physical rehabilitation-has to be delivered where the patient is. And so does all after-purchase service, whether it is servicing a physical product, for example, a machine or a bicycle, or something as non-physical as a bank loan. 
Cars by e-mail 
But at the same time any business, and indeed any institution, that can organise delivery can operate in any market anywhere, without having any physical presence there. 
One example: one of the fastestgrowing businesses in the United States today is an e-mail seller of new passenger automobiles: CarsDirect.com. Based in a Los Angeles suburb, it was founded as recently as January 1999. CarsDirect.com became in July 1999 one of the 20 largest car dealers in the country, operating in 40 of the 50 states of the Union, and selling 1,000 vehicles a month. It does not owe its success to cheaper prices or to particular prowess in selling cars; in fact in these areas it still lags well behind such older and bigger e-commerce automobile dealers as Autobytel.com or CarPoint.com, a Microsoft subsidiary. But CarsDirect, unlike its competitors, has organised a unique delivery system. It has signed up 1,100 traditional dealers throughout the country to deliver CarsDirect's sales to the local purchaser, with a guaranteed delivery date and with quality-controlled service. 
Delivery is equally important-it may indeed be more important-in e-commerce between businesses. And by all indications e-commerce between businesses is growing even faster than e-retail commerce and is becoming transnational even faster. 
But e-commerce separates, for the first time in business history, selling and purchase. Selling is completed when the order has been received and paid for. Purchasing is completed only when the purchase has been delivered and actually not until it satisfies the purchaser's want. And whereas ecommerce demands centralisation, delivery has to be totally decentralised. It needs ultimately to be local, detailed and accurate. 
Just as e-commerce separates selling and purchasing, it separates making and selling. Under e-commerce, what we now know as ""production"" becomes procurement. There is absolutely no reason at all why any e-commerce facility should limit itself to marketing and selling one maker's products or brands. 
In fact, as both Amazon.com and CarsDirect.com show, the great strength of e-commerce is precisely that it provides the customer with a whole range of products, no matter who makes them. But in traditional business structures, selling is still seen and organised as a servant to production, or as the cost centre that ""sells what we make"". In the future e-commerce companies will ""sell what we can deliver"".  1999 By February the Y2K bug will already be fading into memory, having left a lot less damage than many had feared, but having cost a lot more to eliminate than anyone predicted. Companies that had frozen new IT projects for most of 1999 will now be free to invest in the future, not the past. And for them the future is business-to-business e-commerce. This e-business boom will shift the centre of gravity of the Internet industry towards, well, more gravity. Whereas the Internet stock boom of early 1999 was fuelled by fun consumer companies-Amazon, Yahoo!, AOL-many of the rags-to-riches stories of 2000 will be cast from far more serious stuff: industrial trading communities, web-based outsourcing services, business software providers. Although a new crop of e-business darlings will capture the headlines, most of the real ""start-ups"" will not be new companies, but entrepreneurial efforts within big companies, helping each to shift internally in time with the outside revolution. The best firms will find clever ways to encourage this, by creating in-house incubators, corporate venture-capital funds, even stock-option programmes linked to e-business results. 
Why this shift from consumers to companies? Because that is where the infrastructure is, to say nothing of the money. Assume a ""web lifestyle""-having near-constant access to computers with high-speed Internet connectionsand suddenly all sorts of services, from television to finance, naturally move to the web, where they are cheaper, faster, more efficient and far more flexible than the systems they replace. No big population is closer to a web lifestyle than America's office workers, who are sitting on a decade's investment in rcs, software and corporate networks that has never quite paid the dividends promised. The Internet brings it all together, triggering a second wave of corporate automation and the emergence of a host of business-to-business e-commerce companies and services. 
""Application hosting""-paying outside companies to run your huge databases and supply-chain software-will be one such booming e-business market. Its boosters may pitch it as ""free"" software, but in reality it is the shift from software as a product to be bought to software as a service to be paid for. Another booming sector will be industry portals and hubs. For more than a decade, multinationals have been investing billions of dollars in complex systems designed to automate their internal inventory, sales and supply-chain operations. The hardest part has been bringing their business partners-suppliers, customers, service providersinto the loop: the cacophony of different technologies and data formats is too much for most to bear. The Internet has become the great mediator: the largest single barrier-connectivity-disappears; hubs will emerge in industry clusters to provide a lingua franca for sharing data, from product and price lists to shipping information. 
The aim of this is not so much to help companies sell more goods, but to lower the cost of doing so. This will change the economic shape of the industry. From a race between speedy start-ups to capture new consumer markets, it will become a battle of titans as large, established firms in everything from manufacturing to accounting try to use the Internet to gain advantage over their competitors. The new companies that arise will be those that help companies do this best, whether by providing software, services or a marketplace. A slowing stockmarket will leave scars, but the amount of money available for Internet ventures will remain huge: this is an industrial revolution, not a tulip bubble, and good investors always knew that supernormal capitalisations could not last. 
The other technology trends of the year will all stem from the Internet. Mobile phones using the Wireless Application Protocol will hit the streets of Europe, Asia and America, bringing web access, e-mail, even banking to pocket-sized devices. This is the first big step towards the emergence of handheld devices, from personal digital assistants to smart phones, as a rival to the rc for the Internet throne. Sony's PlayStation2 will mark the rise of the consumer-electronics industry as the rc's other competitor. While the rc will improve and become more popular, this is no longer a one-box game. 2000 will be the year when the seeds of something bigger begin to sprout. 
Chris Anderson: Asia business correspondent, The Economist.  1999 The future of advertising? Seemingly, an enviable one. For the past five years, growth rates have consistently outpaced the general growth of SDP in all developed economies. And forecasters predict another decade of expansion, at an average of 8% annually. This is more than respectable for a business that saw global advertising expenditures top out last year at over $400 billion. 
Yet the compelling issues surrounding marketing and communications do not concern the size or long-term viability of our industry. The key questions grow out of the fact that mass marketing, though still the mainstay of our business, will be on the wane. Our future will involve direct interactions linking producers of goods and services to their customers. This is being mandated by digital technology and the Internet, which are driving the convergence of every form of media. And-in our almost overwhelmingly complex landscape of consumer choice and technological changethere will be an increasingly prominent role for brands and for communications initiatives with measurable results. 
So much for the short answers. To understand and unravel their implications, however, it becomes necessary to take a broader look at major developments in the recent history of consumer marketing. 
For some years now, technological innovation has been shifting the balance of power in all areas of marketing. By leading the way in the capture and manipulation of consumer data, retailers wrested a great deal of marketing clout from manufacturers. This, in turn, gave retailers a major influence on a product's success or failure, as well as an important voice in shaping new product development. 
More significant still were the shifts which empowered consumers. Overcapacity has become the rule in industry after industry, creating a glut of goods in most every product category. An increasingly outdated approach to brand management has leaned too heavily on incremental marketing strategies, such as an over-reliance on online extensions and rudimentary demographic targeting. True product differentiation-the critical ingredient of brand building-has become increasingly rare. As if those challenges were not enough, the proliferation of media has created hundreds of channels through which to reach consumers, all but sealing the fate of mass marketing. 
And yet, these changes pale in comparison to the online tsunami we are just beginning to experience. The size of today's Internet economy has been estimated at over $500 billion, and growing fast. Analysts in our business expect American online advertising revenue to grow from under $3 billion this year to more than $30 billion in five years. That is a conservative estimate, because new media, once they pick up steam, tend towards explosive growth. In 1950, Procter & Gamble spent less than 5% of its advertising dollars on a new medium called television; five years later, it was committing 80% of its budget to television. 
But the Internet is more than a medium in the traditional sense. For the first time ever, message delivery has been linked to distribution, as well as to a consumer who can make purchase decisions-at the click of a mouse. 
This explains why consumers are flocking to the web in greater numbers than anyone expected. Online purchases are accelerating, particularly in the business-to-business area. As a result, marketers are being forced to shift their priorities and come to grips with this new reality. It's not hard to see why the opportunities, and the potential pitfalls, of e-commerce are immense. 
From our point of view, what distinguishes the Internet are a number of unique and sustainable attributes. It is available whenever and wherever you want it. It is incredibly affordable. And it is interactive, That is a combination that cannot be found anywhere else in the marketing universe-which is why the Internet will fundamentally change how companies take their products and services to market in the 21st century. 
The web's combination of attributes also gives consumers unprecedented access to information, as well as leverage in shopping for price and demanding specifically customised products and services. Everyone seems to agree, for once and forever more, the customer is king. 
But the provider is also gaining an important new foothold with the customer. Because in the online world, sellers can identify individual consumers and amass considerable data regarding each and every one of them. Soon, the web will also provide even more sophisticated tools with which to discern and analyse a person's purchase patterns and behaviour. 
Those are the areas in which marketing communications will have the most to offer. As the customer perspective increasingly becomes the key driver of a company's overall business strategy, the role of marketing professionals will become more significant. After all, our key talent is in understanding and motivating consumer purchasing behaviour. We are best equipped to build relevant differentiation for brands. And people will increasingly rely on brands as qualifiers and guarantors in a world in which there is too much information and not enough time. 
Clients, also faced with an increasingly complex marketing environment and tremendous constraints on their resources, will look to us as the conductors of their marketing symphonies-choosing the optimal mix from among the persuasive disciplines, for dozens of product lines, in scores of geographies. 
So, while we still need to draw on advertising, direct marketing, public relations and design, the new campaigns we create will increasingly have to incorporate two important new online components: database marketing services and e-commerce solutions. The Internet makes knowing your customer more important than ever. 
Tom Bell, president of Young & Rubicam, sees the advertising Indus try changing beyond recognition.  1999 The first year of the new millennium will set a new and more cautious tone in financial markets-even if it starts with a Y2K bump. The party of the 1990s had been a wonderful one for most markets: in the developed world Japanese equities were the only serious casualty of the decade. But by the final months of 1999 there was already an awareness that no party lasts for ever and that at some stage it would be time to step out into the night and head for home. 
Looked at globally the great monetary achievement of the 1990s had been the conquest of inflation, the scourge of the second half of the 20th century. Markets celebrated that. They also tried to find a way of celebrating-or at least coming to terms with-the burst of innovation in communications of the past five years. Yes, the new technologies will change the performance of the world economy, lifting it a notch or two, just as other bursts of technical advance have done in the past. But how do you price such innovation? And finally the 1990s saw the world economy become steadily more global, a shift in which markets themselves played a crucial part, but which sometimes brought uncomfortable surprises when one bit of the world did not play by the global rules. 
So 2000 will set the markets three tasks. The first will be to judge the broad levels of inflation that will rule during the first part of the century. Are we talking about the present range of central-bank targets of 0-2.5%? Or will inflation reach the 3-5% region? Or will global prices decline? The second task is to price innovation. Financial markets have a lot of experience of coping with technical change, but have found it tough to price the Internet-related technologies: the volatility of prices during 1998 and 1999 represents a market failure. Markets need to do better in 2000. And the third task, most obviously for the currency markets, will be to figure out how global the world really has become. One obvious question is, ""Do current accounts still matter?"" At the beginning of 1999 they thought they didn't; by the end of the year they had reconsidered that view, particularly with regard to the dollar. 
Expect then for 2000 to see markets the world over stumble towards the view that global deflation in the next half century is as likely as global inflation. Sure, there will be peaks and troughs, and the short-term concern about rising inflation will push up short-term interest rates: first for the dollar, then the euro and by the end of 2000, the yen. But global bond yields need not rise and by the end of 2000 the long-term downward trend in yields should be evident again. 
Falling bond yields will underpin equities, which may well have a rough first half of the year. Bear markets happen, bubbles burst, and American equities in particular spent much of 1999 at stretched valuations. The key to ensuring that a bear market does not damage the real economy is to give share prices an anchor. The obvious anchor will be the prospect of continued price stability. So provided the central banks retain the confidence of the markets, share prices will put in an adequate performance. If they fail, expect a difficult year for all major equity markets. 
As for the second test, expect by the end of 2000 markets to be able to price high-technology stocks with much more confidence. The shake-out will render some of the go-go valuations of mid1999 absurd, but the markets will also realise that the new technologies will lift the productivity of the entire business sector. As markets appreciate that profits will come more from clever application than from cutting-edge development, they will begin to look for the substance rather than the hype. So expect a more mature approach to valuing technology: investors will start to look for profits rather than growth. Maybe they will not demand jam today, but they will want jam tomorrow, rather than jam at some indeterminate date in the future. 
Third, assessing global pressures on currencies: in the dim and distant past (like ten years ago) markets thought a current-account deficit was a sign of economic weakness. Recently they came to see it almost as a sign of strength-a current-account deficit equals strong growth and a capital inflow, which in turn indicates confidence both at home and abroad in the economy. If markets are now becoming more cautious they will want to see deficits start to be corrected, and if the United States does not pull back its current-account deficit, expect the dollar to be hit. If that happens, the other ""Anglo"" currencies, including sterling, will be hit with it. The euro, after its sickly birth, will become a healthier but more troublesome two-year-old. It will be healthier because the European recovery will appear more secure. It will be troublesome because the ""one-size-fitsall"" interest rate will mean that twothirds of Europe has the wrong rate. Tensions between the slower growing core and the fizzing fringe will grow. Elsewhere, expect the yen to have unexpected stability and the gradual recovery of confidence in most emerging markets to continue. 
So 2000 will be a more thoughtful, more mature year in the financial markets than 1999 turned out to be. Expect bond yields globally to end the year lower than they were at the beginning; expect share prices to be steady and recovering, whatever happens in the meantime. Expect technology companies to be rated by a cool assessment as to how soon they are going to be profitable rather than how big they might become. And expect currency stability if, and only if, current-account imbalances start to shrink. As for the wild card of Y2K-the great news will be that by the end of 2000 it will have become a distant memory. But so too will the 1990s party: welcome to a more sober decade. 
Hamish McRae: author of ""The World in 2020"" and associate editor of The Independent.  1999 In most countries central banks now have more power and independence than ever before. Alan Greenspan, chairman of America's Federal Reserve, is probably the most revered central banker in world history. However, as a result of some serious monetary policy mistakes, central banks will face an uncomfortable year in 2000; some are likely to come under fierce political attack. Their prominence will start to decline. 
Central banking as we know it today is in fact a relatively recent invention. At the start of this century there were only 18 central banks; today there are 173. (When economies were on the gold standard or a dollar standard, they did not need a central bank to set interest rates.) Not only have they increased in number, but central banks have also gained independence from governments. Ten years ago, most central banks (the Fed and the Bundesbank being two main exceptions) were still firmly under the thumb of finance ministers, who told them when to change interest rates. But shortsighted politicians were often tempted to engineer a pre-election boom, which pushed up inflation. So today most central banks have been given independence and full control of the monetary reins. The new European Central Bank (ECa) has been set up as the most independent and powerful central bank in the world. Even the Bank of Japan, which has been widely blamed for Japan's prolonged slump after the bursting of its bubble, now has independence in setting interest rates. 
As well as power, many central banks have also won increased respect. This is partly due to their success in crushing inflation-now at its lowest level for almost half a century in the rich economies. But it is also partly thanks to the stunning success of Mr Greenspan in steering the American economy through almost nine years of uninterrupted, low inflationary growth-the longest peacetime expansion in American history. Mr Greenspan is worshipped almost like a god by investors who believe that he has eliminated the business cycle and so ensured ever-rising share prices. 
What might go wrong? Financial markets and the general public have excessive faith in what central banks can achieve. Their ability to steer economies with precision is much more limited than commonly realised. The immediate danger is not that inflation will return to its double-digit levels of the 1970s, for central bankers will be quick to raise interest rates if consumer prices accelerate. Instead there are new hazards to which central bankers, brought up on the idea that their sole job was to defeat inflation, have not yet woken up. Their new enemies are asset-price inflation and deflation. 
Judged by the test of low inflation, both the Fed and the Bank of Japan might be seen to have done a good job. But look closer and America's economy shows alarming signs of excess. By most standard measures, share prices look overvalued; firms and households have been on a borrowing binge; the broad M3 measure of money has been growing at its fastest rate in real terms for a quarter century; and the current-account deficit is nearing record levels. These are all classic symptoms of a bubble. The Fed has made a big mistake in ignoring share prices and these other imbalances. For history suggests that rapid increases in the prices of assets, such as shares or property, can be just as dangerous as consumer-price inflation. 
This does not mean that central banks should abandon the long-term goal of price stability, or try to target share prices. However, they should remember that price stability is not an end in itself, but only a means to the real objective of steady growth. In 2000-as America's bubble goes ""pop""-central banks will come to accept that they must widen their vision to take account of other signs of excess in setting monetary policy, such as asset prices, excessive growth in money and credit, and widening external deficits. 
The Bank of Japan's error lies at the other extreme. It has failed to realise that deflation can be even more dangerous than inflation. Since Japan's bubble of the late 1980s burst, the bank has consistently ignored the economic lessons of the 1930s and been too slow to ease monetary policy to support the economy. Although output has started to recover, Japan still shows many signs of deflation. Prices and wages are declining and output remains well below productive capacity. It is true that Japanese interest rates are close to zero, but when prices are falling, that still leaves real rates painfully high. The recent surge in the yen, which threatens to choke off Japan's fragile recovery and to worsen deflationary pressures, confirms that monetary policy is too tight. Even if the bank cannot push interest rates any lower, it can still push down the yen by, in effect, printing money. Yet the Bank of Japan has stubbornly refused to ease policy to halt the yen's rise. Its official reason is that it believes that policy is loose enough. What really holds it back, however, is that it wants to preserve its newly won independence and is therefore loth to cave in to politicians calling for monetary easing-even if they may be right. 
It may be too late for both the Fed and the Bank of Japan to escape blame. If America's stockmarket bubble bursts painfully, fickle investors, consumers and businessmen will quickly see Mr Greenspan in a rather less favourable light. Expect Congress to try to curb the Fed's powers. If the Bank of Japan continues stubbornly to refuse to ease monetary policy and thereby chokes the economy's nascent recovery, it too will face a political backlash. The problem with increased power is that you get all the blame when things go wrong. 
expected the share behaving ethically to double, to 47%. 
Such changes are thanks partly to investors. Those who want an easy conscience have plenty of choice. A survey of ""ethical"" investment in America, by Wiesenberger, a firm that tracks mutual funds, includes no fewer than 183 such funds in equities and bonds, domestic and foreign equities, small-cap and midcap, you name it. But will the investors see a decent return? The idea that virtue can be consistently more profitable than vice sounds too good to be true. Yet there is some evidence to support the claim. The Wiesenberger study, for example, found that what it calls ""socially screened funds"" had, on average, done consistently better than other funds (although they tended to be more risky and slightly more expensive). 
In the autumn of 1999 Dow Jones published a new index, the Dow Jones Sustainability Index (nasi), which it had drawn up with Sustainability Group, a Swiss firm that specialises in ethical financial services. ""Sustainability"" is defined according to a range of criteria measuring a firm's performance in economic, environmental and social terms. The index is composed of 229 firms, with a market value of $4.3 trillion, that are the 10% most sustainable companies in 68 industries across the world. 
At first sight, the strikingly good financial performance of the index is evidence that the ethical crowd are on to something. The companies in the index, which includes names such as Honeywell, Unilever, Skandia and Fujitsu, had on average produced higher shareholder returns over five years than other firms in their part of the world; on the whole, they also did better than the rest of their particular industry. 
Yet if lousy firms conclude that they can solve their problems simply by being nicer to their workers, they may be in for a shock. Which comes first, sustainability, profits or good management? Remember the old maxim that a clean factory is an efficient factory. Able managers tend to avoid waste, prevent accidents and motivate their staff, whether they are setting out to be sustainable or not. Few of the firms contained in the n,rsi satisfy the enthusiasts' call for a ""triple bottom line"" that would elevate social and environmental reporting to the status of financial reporting. 
Arguably, business ethics is as much about protection as opportunism. After damaging scandals, firms such as Nike and Mattel have felt obliged to pay closer attention to, say, working conditions in their suppliers' factories. Yet poor old Shell, which had spent a lot of money on trying to be a good corporate citizen, encountered a storm after it said it would dump the Brent Spar oil-platform in an ocean trench-even though the idea eventually proved reasonable. Similarly, Monsanto, an American firm that has shown a keen interest in the triple bottom line, is now a bogeyman in Europe because it makes genetically modified organisms. Ethical behaviour offers some insurance against public-relations disasters, but it is by no means a guarantee. 
sions, and without a bid-offer spread, will be launched in the second half of 2000. Smaller broker-dealers will find it particularly hard to cope in this new environment. They may have to slim down services, such as research, which is traditionally paid for through trading commission, in order to trim costs. Posit, a similar system, which allows institutional investors to deal with each other blindly-thus lessening the risk that the market will move away from them when they place a large order-will further develop and expand its young business. Other electronic networks, such as Island, one of the best-known American ECNS, will consider expanding into Europe. 
European exchanges will struggle to establish a viable alternative to America's NASDAQ, where Microsoft is listed, for young European high-tech companies. NASDAQ's listings of European equities have stalled since the launch of Frankfurt's Neuer Markt in March 1997. The Neuer Markt faces new competition from techMARK, the London Stock Exchange's new market for technology stocks, and reinvigorated rivalry from its four fellow euro-zone partners in Euro NM, an alliance of markets for young high-tech companies from EASDAQ, which was also set up as a direct copy of NASDAQ. 
Europe's 31 depositories will come under pressure to consolidate from Europe's banks, which are irate at being asked to pay for overlapping and incompatible systems. Smaller depositories will be encouraged to sign up for one of three models of integration on offer. Euroclear, the international bond clearing house, while it has the support of the big international banks for its ""hub and spokes"" model, will struggle to gain the co-operation of other European clearing houses, until its ties with operator J.P. Morgan are finally severed in 2002. That may give its rival, Cedel, time to make progress in its establishment of a ""European Clearing House"". London's Crest will also tie up a few more countries' clearing systems, along with Ireland's and Switzerland's, into its network. By the end of 2000, Europe will not have a single market for European equities, but the shape of the new market will become clearer. 
Goodbye to Glass-Steagall, the law that kept American 
financial services apart. Now banking-braking-insuring conglomerates will form rapidly. 
More strength to Wall Street. 
Pam Woodall: economics editor, The Economist.  1999 ""Goodness is greed."" Such would be the text of Gordon Gekko, the beastly broker from Wall Street, were he today to preach how firms should conduct themselves in 2000. Companies increasingly seem to think that being ""ethical"" will make them rich. Groups as different as Electrolux, a Swedish white-goods firm, and DuPont, an American chemicals giant, have taken to the idea that the best way to be nice to your shareholders is to be nice to your workers and your environment too. 
The ethics of self interest is not a new philosophy, but it is moving inexorably from the campaigners' den to the boardroom. Firms that once attracted the fury of non-governmental organisations (NGOS) have crossed the barricades. Rio Tinto and Placer Dome, two mining companies, are part of a consortium that is setting out to advise firms on how to provide health care for the people living around their mines. Similar guidelines are being drawn up by a body that sets standards for a group of oil companies, including Royal Dutch/Shell and BP. The World Health Organisation, under its new head, Gro Harlem Brundtland, a former prime minister of Norway, has for the first time begun to work closely with private companies. In 1999 De Beers, another mining firm, paid $2.7m to help eradicate polio in Angola. 
Such collaboration is becoming almost fashionable. A survey of 133 NGOS, published by PricewaterhouseCoopers, an accountancy firm, found that their attitudes to business are rapidly changing. NGOS currently take a dim view of multinational companies, with 41% describing relations as ""antagonistic"" and 62% believing that capitalists do not much care about ethics. But the same NGOS thought that in the future (the survey did not specify when) the share of multinational companies that want to co-operate with NGOS will increase fivefold, to 61%; they expected the share behaving ethically to double, to 47%. 
Such changes are thanks partly to investors. Those who want an easy conscience have plenty of choice. A survey of ""ethical"" investment in America, by Wiesenberger, a firm that tracks mutual funds, includes no fewer than 183 such funds in equities and bonds, domestic and foreign equities, small-cap and midcap, you name it.

The index is composed of 229 firms, with a market value of $4.3 trillion, that are the 10% most sustainable companies in 68 industries across the world.

Few of the firms contained in the DJSI satisfy the enthusiasts' call for a ""triple bottom line"" that would elevate social and environmental reporting to the status of financial reporting.

Edward Carr: business editor, The Economist.  1999 Emerging markets are back on line. Net private inflows of capital into the emerging economies will total around $120 billion in 2000, a 75% increase on 1999 levels. Latin America will receive the major share, the result of having rich old Uncle Sam next door and a relatively well-established rule of law. Although flows into Asia are looking healthier, the region will suffer a net outflow as loans are repaid. A return to the 1996 inflow of $100 billion is unlikely for at least the next three years. Problems in Indonesia and China will get worse before they get better. And investors know it.  1999 In a few years' time our e-wise grandchildren will wonder how on earth a market worked without the Internet. Such is the sublime ease with which it brings buyers and sellers together, transfers information-everyone's favourite commodity-and allows you to buy and sell any time, any place, that real markets seem hopelessly clumsy in comparison. 
You may well want to disabuse these youngsters over their cyber-naivety, but when it comes to trading shares on the Internet they will definitely be on to something. The trick with equity trading is simple: the Internet allows far more people into the market, settlement can be made just by switching a few digits around in cyberspace and you can trade when you want, where you want. The Internet and share-trading are, in short, what the word synergy was invented for. 
So prediction number one: massive growth. Jupiter Communications, an IT consultancy, estimates that by 2003 online brokerages will be managing assets worth $3 trillion. That is roughly equivalent to what the top three investment banks held in 1998, a sizable slice of the international asset pie. Forrester, another IT consultancy, predicts that the number of households with online accounts will more than quadruple over the next three years from 5m in 1999. In Japan, investors will use their games consoles to trade. 
For many, the obvious winners of the current trend are the big discounters such as E*Trade (the largest Internet-only broker), Datek and Ameritrade, which stack trades high and sell them low. These are the brokers of choice for America's 5,000 day-traders. 
Yet, for all the radical new dynamics at the core of the e-brokerage business model lies an old-fashioned economic conundrum-the pay-off between price and value. Low prices are not everything-many people would prefer some advice too. That is why even after 20 years of deregulated commission rates, American discounters have cornered only 25% of the retail market. With ""free trades"" probably arriving in 2000 (paid for by those guys in advertising), revenues will undoubtedly fall. Thus prediction number two: price wars will lead to largely pyrrhic victories for a few discounters. 
In reaction, many companies will attempt to add value to lowish prices. Traditional discounters are moving upstream to become ""mid-tier"" firms. Charles Schwab and Fidelity will seek to sell advice, portfolio management and even banking services to their clients. Forrester estimates that assets managed by the mid-tiers will grow tenfold by 2003 to $1.5 trillion. 
Prediction three is cataclysmic: the end of fullservice brokering as we know it. Many analysts believe that the current 20% of all the retail trade done on the Internet will rise to 50% by 2001. And the Internet, already awash with financial information, is quickly undermining the rationale for paying high prices-$100300 per transaction compared with $15 from a discounter-for informed trades. This means pain for the full-service brokers such as Merrill Lynch over the next five years. Until now they have remained confident that the quality of their research would keep customers loyal. They also feared that by going online they would cannibalise their traditional business. Led by Prudential, many took their first steps online in 1999. Yet 2000 will be the year when they begin successfully to evolve, or have their fates sealed as financial dinosaurs. Watch them travel downstream with Internet operations, lower prices and brand-based advertising campaigns to do battle with the mid-tier firms. 
And now the bad news 
So prediction four appears obvious: cheaper prices, better information and wealthier individual investors. Only that it is not. Share prices go up and down even in cyberspace. The problem is that someone somewhere has to lose money; it does not matter whether the information you have bought is good-it has to be better than your competitors'. That might encourage you to pay a premium for top-notch research. Or, if you know about the efficient-market hypothesis, it might cause you to despair. 
The hypothesis, a basic plank of finance theory, dirties an otherwise rosy picture. It holds that you cannot beat the market since all the information available to you is already reflected in the share price. And with a thousand other online investors better informed and a few seconds quicker than you are, what hope is there of consistently making a buck? 
Research in America shows that three in every four daytraders make a loss. And that is in a bull market. Calls to provide new regulations for a newish industry will only get stronger with any future sustained market fall. Those instant-riches advertisements look naive now-with a big fall they may appear criminally irresponsible. And in America, you know what that means. 
Thus to cater for the more cautious investment generation who prefer mutual funds, the Internet will provide two key services: ease of transaction and price transparency. Internet buying of mutuals will boom. Financial planning sites will proliferate. Fund companies who present their products in the best possible statistical light will have their products compared using common standards. This transparency is a good thing and will lead, the fifth prediction, to better-value funds. A help, no doubt, in paying for educating those e-wise descendants.  1999 Europe's stock exchanges will have to fight three battles in 2000. First, their strategy to consolidate trading across borders to create one pool of liquidity will be countered by the emergence of electronic communications networks (ECNS); these will offer cheaper, and often anonymous, ways of doing business. Second, the new European markets for high-growth companies will each vie to be seen as the NASDAQ of Europe, as will NASDAQ itself. Third, Europe's clearing houses, the Cinderellas of the trading world, will fight it out to see which becomes the leader. All of this will take place against a shift towards equities across Europe as governments make clear that individuals must provide for most of their own retirement costs. 
The failure of the London Stock Exchange (LSE) and the Deutsche Borse to produce the truly unified trading platform that they promised when they unveiled an alliance in July 1998 has left a void in European trading. Paul Roy, head of equities at Merrill Lynch, an American investment bank, says the substitute proposal, to link brokerages to a number of exchanges electronically, is not enough. However, others argue that modern technology makes this the obvious shortterm solution. Bengt Ryden, head of Stockholm's stock exchange, which itself is a listed company, boycotted the eightcountry alliance headed by London and Frankfurt, preferring instead to let foreign brokerages connect electronically to Stockholm. 
Europe's exchanges will realise that their main competition is no longer from each other. New scNS will make an attractive bid for trading volume, promising what London-Frankfurt failed to deliver: a single platform for pan-European stock trading. Tradepoint, which failed to make an impression against London when first launched, looks better positioned following a refinancing which has included most of the big investment banks. True, its owners will continue to gain more from trading through traditional exchanges, but they know that their own clients, the ""buy-side"" asset managers and pension funds, may bypass them altogether if they do not move with the times. E-Crossnet, a mechanism for fund managers to buy and sell shares without having to pay broker commissions, and without a bid-offer spread, will be launched in the second half of 2000. Smaller broker-dealers will find it particularly hard to cope in this new environment. They may have to slim down services, such as research, which is traditionally paid for through trading commission, in order to trim costs. Posit, a similar system, which allows institutional investors to deal with each other blindly-thus lessening the risk that the market will move away from them when they place a large order-will further develop and expand its young business. Other electronic networks, such as Island, one of the best-known American sots, will consider expanding into Europe. 
European exchanges will struggle to establish a viable alternative to America's NASDAQ, where Microsoft is listed, for young European high-tech companies. NASDAQ's listings of European equities have stalled since the launch of Frankfurt's Neuer Markt in March 1997. The Neuer Markt faces new competition from techniK, the London Stock Exchange's new market for technology stocks, and reinvigorated rivalry from its four fellow euro-zone partners in Euro NM, an alliance of markets for young high-tech companies from EASDAQ, which was also set up as a direct copy of NASDAQ. 
Europe's 31 depositories will come under pressure to consolidate from Europe's banks, which are irate at being asked to pay for overlapping and incompatible systems. Smaller depositories will be encouraged to sign up for one of three models of integration on offer. Euroclear, the international bond clearing house, while it has the support of the big international banks for its ""hub and spokes"" model, will struggle to gain the co-operation of other European clearing houses, until its ties with operator J.P. Morgan are finally severed in 2002. That may give its rival, Cedel, time to make progress in its establishment of a ""European Clearing House"". London's Crest will also tie up a few more countries' clearing systems, along with Ireland's and Switzerland's, into its network. By the end of 2000, Europe will not have a single market for European equities, but the shape of the new market will become clearer. 
Margaret Doyle: financial correspondent, The Economist.  1999 Will the dramatic expansion of global stockmarket capitalisation from $9.3 trillion in 1990 to about $25 trillion hold? As a result of the bull market on Wall Street, the United States now accounts for about half the world's stockmarket capitalisation compared with only about 30% in 1990. Japan, by contrast, has shrunk from 40% to only about 11%, its lowest share since the early 1950s. The growth of America's stockmarket capitalisation has played a decisive role in powering the growth of both consumer spending and capital investment. But with stockmarket capitalisation at 150% of cDr compared with an average of 49% over the previous 60 years, there is a risk that a correction will have a more depressing impact on domestic spending than previous bear markets. This inflation of asset values-and the knock-on effect that a correction of, say, 25% would have on the real economy-will be Alan Greenspan's greatest single preoccupation in 2000. 
The driving force in the expansion of the American equity market has been the spectacular performance of the technology sector. It has expanded to a market capitalisation of over $2.7 trillion. It now accounts for about a quarter of America's overall stockmarket capitalisation compared with 10% in 1990. The changing composition of the equity market reflects the fact that information technology now accounts for about 20% of American capital stock compared with 18% in Britain, 14% in Sweden, 11% in Germany and 8% in Japan. The leader in this process has been Microsoft, which enjoys a market capitalisation of some $500 billion. If Microsoft can sustain the growth performance of 1998 and early 1999 for another year, it will soon qualify to join the Group of Seven rich countries by boasting a market capitalisation larger than Canada's GDr. But whereas technology has boomed, the value of traditional sectors such as mining and heavy industry has slumped. In mid1999, the total market capitalisation of the global metals industry, including steel mills, gold mines, copper mines and other mineral companies, was only about $320 billion, or just over 60% of the market capitalisation of Microsoft. Watch for the ability of high-tech stocks to deliver profits in 2000. But note how this huge change will likewise change society in the years ahead. Nowhere will change more in 2000 than Japan. In the modern era, Japan has had a system of stakeholder capitalism in which profits played a less decisive role in corporate decision-making than concerns about sales, asset size and employment. The result is that Japanese firms have a return on equity of only 2%, compared with 20% in the United States and 15% in Western Europe. But the collapse of profitability has triggered a stockmarket decline which is setting the stage for a revolution in the relationship between management and shareholders. As a result of depressed equity-market returns, Japanese firms have an unfunded pension Liability of 80 trillion ($730 billion). They will probably correct it by injecting into the pension pot a large share of the corporate crossshareholdings, which have been the financial counterpart of stakeholder capitalism. When this adjustment occurs, Japan will have a powerful constituency demanding that firms focus more attention on profitability for the first time in its modern history. Ironically, the ageing of Japanese society will compel the private sector to introduce a more dynamic form of capitalism in order to satisfy the income needs of the growing population of retired people. 
Look for dramatic change in Europe. Take Germany's rapidly growing marketplace, called the Neuer Markt, with over 125 small technology companies and an aggregate market capitalisation of about $40 billion. Software companies account for 22% of the market while Internet service providers and other Internet companies make up another 20%. The rise of the new market represents the most dramatic breakthrough in the development of a popular equity culture in Germany since the second world war. This is not just a new market, it is a new mind-set. It bodes well for Frankfurt and ill for the City of London. Indeed, whereas the German stockmarket once experienced trading pauses on Jewish holidays, volume now slumps when student holidays occur. 
2000 will see large chunks of the world with new-and much improvedbanking systems. Latin America has opened up its financial system to foreign investment so much that over half of all bank assets now belong to foreigncontrolled institutions. Argentina has gone the furthest because its use of a currency board means that its central bank can no longer be the lender of last resort. And as a result of the ownership changes since 1995, Argentina's banks now depend upon lenders of last resort in London, Madrid, Hong Kong and Washington, not just Buenos Aires. Due to the recent financial crisis, Asia is also opening up to foreign investment in the financial system. In another 12 months, foreign institutions will probably control at least 40% of the banking systems of Thailand, South Korea and Indonesia compared with nothing five years ago. In Eastern Europe the story is the same. German, Dutch, Irish and Austrian banks now control over half of all bank assets in Poland, and in Hungary foreigners have almost a 90% market share. Estonia, another currency-board country, has sold about 80% of its banking system to the Swedes. Future banking crises will be lesser, more controllable, phenomena as a result. 
Will emerging markets upset the apple cart? Their stockmarket capitalisation declined by several hundred million dollars during 1998 after expanding from $488 billion to $2.2 trillion between 1988 and 1996. The developing countries' share of global stockmarket capitalisation is now only 8% compared with 14% in 1996. But the contraction has created the potential for a tremendous catch-up. After all, these same countries will account for 45% of world output, 70% of the world's land area, 85% of the world's population and 99% of the projected growth in the global labour force during the early decades of the 21st century. 
Popular share ownership has grown dramatically in many countries as a result of the 1990s stockmarket boom. The United States mutual-funds industry now has assets larger than the banking system. It is estimated that 45% of Americans are in the market either directly or through mutual funds, compared with 5% in the 1950s. Australia now has more shareholders than trade-union members. The collapse of interest rates which resulted from monetary union in Europe has also encouraged a dramatic growth of the mutual-fund sector in countries such as Italy and Spain. During 1998 Italian mutual funds attracted over 35 billion ($37 billion) of retail-savings flows while Spain's mutual funds received nearly 10 billion. Many developing countries are introducing pension funds in order to promote wider share ownership and help finance privatisation of state enterprises. Singapore began the process during the 1960s. Chile went further during the 1980s. Today, there are several Latin American countries with pension funds which have an aggregate market value of over $150 billion. When the cold war ended, there were probably only 100m people on the planet who owned a share or had a pension plan. By 2000 there will be over one billion shareholders in both the industrial and developing countries. The resultant change in world politics is palpable-and wholly for the good. 
China is now so anxious to stimulate consumer spending that its government has begun to talk up the stockmarket. There were editorials in the People's Daily during the summer of 1999 calling upon investors to buy equities. The government is liberalising its rules for bank lending to brokerage firms. Officials also say that private firms, not just former state enterprises, will be able to list on the market. But policy will have to remain supportive of the market for some time if rising equity prices are to buoy the economy. China's market capitalisation is only about 25% of GDP there are only 35m shareholders. 
The growth of retail-share ownership has not reduced the role of institutional investors in the market. In the case of the United States, the expansion of mutual funds to $6 billion of assets has increased the power of large institutions. Firms with more than $100m under management now control equities worth about 51% of America's market capitalisation, compared with 27.6% in 1980. The result of this increasing concentration in market share has been to produce an institutional bias in favour of large companies, which has caused them significantly to outperform smaller companies during the 1990s. This is an unhealthy development. Watch for the start of a correction in 2000. 
The new role of stockmarkets as storehouses of personal wealth and engines of capital formation suggests that they will play a far more important role in the formulation of public policy than ever before. Governments everywhere are being compelled to give their citizens more options for their retirement savings than just government debt. Central banks are increasingly being forced to make judgments about equity markets when determining whether monetary policy should be adjusted. 
There is little doubt, for example, that the Federal Reserve would welcome a modest stockmarket correction in the United States in order to slow the growth rate of domestic consumption. Every January, the Wall Street Journal conducts a survey of United States forecasters to find out their predictions for the year ahead. Since 1994, the consensus has been a projection of only 2.3% output growth compared with an actual outcome of 3.5% a year. 
The task confronting the Federal Reserve in 2000 is to engineer a soft landing in which equity prices do not fall too far. The challenge is unique because the United States has a huge currentaccount deficit. America's households have been on a buying spree that has kept the rest of the world from recession. But this deficit has been financed only by foreigners buying American equity. If the stockmarket were to fall sharply, there is a risk that the dollar could also collapse, with destabilising consequences for bond prices and all financial assets. As a result, both the United States economy and the global economy are now more dependent upon the performance of the New York equity market than at any other time in history. 
David Hale: chief investment analyst, Zurich Financial Services, Chicago.  1999 After a run of several thousand years, it is entirely fitting that 2000 will be marked as the year the tide turned against taxation. Clay tablets recall the taxes of Hammurabi in the Babylon of 2000BC, but the practice is certainly older. People in power have always tried to divert some of the proceeds of economic activity in their own direction. Lords took feudal dues from their vassals; landowners took tolls from merchants; gangsters took protection money from small businesses; governments took taxes from their citizens. Despite the different names, the principle has remained constant: those who do not produce take resources from those who do, and spend it on altogether different things. 
The tide is turning because of the convergence of several factors. In the first place, taxes are becoming harder to collect. Capital is more mobile than ever, and inclined to fly from places that tax to places that do not. Governments do not move their boundaries and jurisdictions as rapidly as companies can change locations. Attempts to establish trans-national tax powers are almost certainly doomed by international competition to attract economic activity. Many businesses will choose to stay out of reach. 
The global economy and the Internet mean that purchases can now cross frontiers. People buy books, clothes and cars from abroad, and any finance minister who likes to tax these items finds his tax base diminishing. It is not only capital and goods which are harder to pin down. Even wages are crossing frontiers. The rise of the service sector means that many income-generating activities can take place across frontiers, causing yet more headaches for overstretched public treasuries. Furthermore, the pace of electronic, hard-to-trace activity is accelerating. 
No less important has been the rise of political resistance. The past quarter century has been marked by a movement led in Britain and America towards tax limitation. It announced itself in California's famous tax-cutting referendum Proposition 13, but saw its fullest expression in the Thatcher and Reagan tax cuts of the 1980s. Britain's Tories entered office in 1979 with the top rate of income tax at 98%, and left office 18 years later with a top rate of 40%. Indeed, their Labour opponents became electable only after a firm promise not to raise it again. In the United States, George W Bush would not make his father's mistake of increasing taxes despite a ""read my lips"" pledge. The plain fact is that electorates these days will not stand for it. They recognise, correctly, that governments spend their money less carefully and less efficiently than they can spend it themselves. 
One of the greatest uses of tax money is to provide pensions. And here a revolution-as important and pervasive as privatisation-is sweeping the world. Fully funded personal pension plans, based on an individual's savings, are sweeping away the poorly funded public pensions promised by governments. The latter take taxes from the young to support the old. The former invest savings from the young to support themselves when old. 
A lead all will follow 
Singapore blazed the trail in the 1950s with individual provident accounts, but it was when Chile pioneered the replacement of state pensions with private funds in 1981 that the world took notice. Their lead set a pattern which has increasingly been followed in South America and, more recently, Poland. Britain itself has largely converted to private 
personal funds, whose total value, well in excess of $1 trillion, exceeds that of all of its EU partners combined. Britain's vestigial state pensions are of ever-diminishing significance. 
Tax-transfer schemes are vulnerable to demographic changes. If the numbers of old people increase, if they require support for more years, or if the numbers in work decrease, the adverse balance can impose unacceptable tax burdens on the young. Belgium, France, Italy and Germany most of all, have yet to face the tax consequences of their profligate promissory notes. Their expensive attempts to do so will provide one of the main economic dramas of the next decade. It is also the case that funded pensions give better value. The fund grows with the economy, aiding it in turn with investment, and achieving better returns than can be relied on from governments. 
Taxes are thus being squeezed from three directions: the increased mobility brought by globalisation, electoral resistance to taxation, and a movement away from tax-funded schemes. All of this will make life difficult for finance ministers. The solution in Britain has been to opt for ""stealth"" taxes which do not show, but few suppose this will be more than a temporary expedient. A more permanent solution will be for finance ministers to recognise their limitations and for governments to live within their means. Money-laundering becomes easy in Brazil with the arrival of 250m plastic banknotes in April.  1999 Uncle Sam's commercial domination is only in its infant stage, asserts Martin Sorrell, chief executive of WPP, an advertising giant. 
Theodore Levitt may have got it wrong. In 1983 he wrote an article in the Harvard Business Review saying that we were all going to market global products and services in the same way everywhere. Twenty years on, the thesis seems wrong in one particular respect: there is not a global way of marketing, rather there is an American way. America's business methods have become the world's. 
If you are going to run or develop a business of global significance, domination of the American market is critical. In almost every category of industry or services, the real winners will be those companies that have strong franchises rooted in the United States. In advertising and marketing services, for example, approximately 45% of the expenditure in this $1 trillion industry originates in the United States. About two-- thirds of this expenditure is controlled or, to be more politically correct, is ""influenced"" from there. 
The same is true of many other industries, particularly for those companies that seek to share information efficiently around the world. Chief executives may devolve power to regional or brand-based business units, but they also want to ensure that wheels are not being needlessly reinvented in international organisations. The controls they put in place are usually rooted in America. 
This economic power and the relative homogeneity of the American market are being exploited ruthlessly as American corporations push their products and services around the world. Thus there is not a global standard, in the Levitt sense, but an American one. It is a standard driven by the need to hit financial targets demanded by shareholders. 
If you tell the Street or the City that you intend to increase your profits or earnings per share or return on capital, by 5% to 15% a year, you can do it only by taking share from a competitor or expanding globally. Expansion is probably easier and more profitable. 
But a decision to expand internationally faces every chief executive with three problems. And the answer to each of these reinforces the conclusion that to be global it is necessary to be American. 
The first is brand. To gain marketshare companies need to brand products ever more strongly; and many of the most powerful brands, of course, are American. 
The second is the web, which threatens to shake up every product and service without exception. The web may be global but its culture and driving force is American. 
The third is the need that every business has to communicate its strategic changes internally as well as externally; if the people within the organisation don't understand policy, then external communication will obviously suffer. This internal communication often follows, or reinforces, an American mind-set. 
If you thought this trend was welldeveloped, just reflect on the fact that the average American-based multinational still derives only 20% of its sales or profits from outside the United States. The average corporation is more like Pepsi-Cola, which still has 80% of its business inside the United States, rather than Coca-Cola, which has 80% outside. So there is still a long way to go. 
If all this were not enough, the dominant position of a strong American market is being reinforced by a strong capital market. Despite a narrowing recently, stockmarket valuations on the American side of the Atlantic are still generally higher. In almost every category this gives American-quoted companies a lower cost of equity capital and hence a lower average cost of capital. As a result, stronger organic growth is being reinforced by stronger growth through acquisitions. Again, this trend will have a long way to go in 2000 and beyond. European-only mergers do not solve the problem. They are purely defensive. If Deutsche Telekom and Telecom Italia had been brought together, what would this have done in the United States, the largest telecoms market in the world? Nothing. 
Similarly, what does the marriage of Carrefour and Promodes do offensively? Defensively, it may be a way of dealing with the arrival in Europe of America's Wal-Mart, the world's largest retailer, but for it to succeed it must exploit the advantages afforded it in Latin America and China. 
Europe isn't global 
A more cohesive European market will risk encouraging European-based multinationals to focus too much on Europe and too little on the United States and beyond. Despite a market of 350m people, 100m greater than the United States, Europe's union lacks the homogeneity of the American market. 
What is the answer? The development of global businesses which are rooted in the strongest and most vibrant market in the world-the United States. You only have to review the car industry, any packaged-goods sector, the computer industry, the new technologies and web companies, high-tech and telecommunications, entertainment, media, and health care. Nor is this confined to making things. It also applies to services. Look at the consultancy industry, investment or commercial banking. 
There are companies that understand. sr Amoco and Vodafone lead the way in the United Kingdom. Vivendi leads the French invasion of the United States as does DaimlerChrysler from Germany. Telefonica looks like it will do the same from Spain although it is focusing on Latin America initially. 
The only reason for caution is that we were talking about Japan in the same terms only a decade ago, and look where Japan is now. Trends such as these can go the other way. Historically, they usually do so. Economic and political domination by one state does not usually last long. 
Reading on paper is so much a part of our lives that it is hard to imagine anything could ever replace inky marks on shredded trees. Since Johannes Gutenberg invented an economical way to make movable metal type in the 15th century, making it possible to produce reading matter quickly, comparatively cheaply and in large quantities, the printed word has proved amazingly resilient. So how could anyone believe that sales of electronic books will equal those of paper books within a decade or so? 
First, it is worth remembering that paper is only the latest in a long line 
of reading ""technologies"" that were made obsolete each time an improved solution emerged. Pictures drawn on rock gave way to clay tablets with cuneiform characters pressed into the clay before it dried. Clay gave way to animal skin scrolls marked with text, and then to papyrus scrolls. By 100An the codex had arrived, but it was not until the ninth century that the first real paper book was produced. In Europe, paper was rare until after Gutenberg's breakthrough. 
It took a few more centuries for ebooks to emerge. They were first envisioned in 1945 by Vannevar Bush, director of the United States Office of Scientific Research and Development. In his classic essay, ""As We May Think"", Bush described a gadget he called a ""memex""=`a device in which an individual stores all his books, records, and communications... Most of the memex contents are purchased on microfilm ready for insertion. Books of all sorts, pictures, current periodicals, newspapers, are thus obtained and dropped into place... Wholly new forms of encyclopedias will appear, ready-made with a mesh of associative trails running through them..."" 
Although science-fiction writers eagerly adopted Bush's ideas-notably on the television show ""Star Trek"", where portable electronic books featured regularly-the real world has remained loyal to paper. Only in the encyclopedia market, which was transformed by CD-ROMS in the mid-1980s, has the e-book made real progress. Far more encyclopedias, from Microsoft's Encarta to Encyclopedia Britannica, are sold on cn-ROM than were ever sold on paper, because they cost a fraction of the price and are easier to search. But attempts to broaden the appeal of e-book technology to ""ludic"" (or pleasure) readers have been unsuccessful. Since the late 1980s the electronic publishing world has seen several failed e-book ventures. 
Why? Most of them used devices that were either too bulky to carry around, or forced users to ""stock up"" their electronic library in inconvenient ways. (One required visits to a ""book bank"", an ATM-- like machine that was to be located in bookstores.) Before widespread adoption of the Internet, there was no universal way to download new reading material. But the most fundamental problem was the lack of a display technology that could compete with paper when it came to ludic reading. 
For paper books, readability depends on many factors: typeface and size, line length and spacing, page and margin size, and the colour of print and paper. But for e-books there are even more factors, including resolution, flicker, luminance, contrast and glare. Most typefaces were not designed for screens and, thanks to a limited number of pixels, are just fuzzy reproductions of the originals. The result is that reading onscreen is hard on the eyes and takes a lot more effort. People do it only for short documents. The longer the read, the more irritating and distracting are all the faults in display, layout and rendering. 
Most of these problems are now being solved. The World Wide Web offers an amazingly flexible way to deliver books in bits-and as investments in broadband infrastructure increase, it will get even easier to stock an e-library. And dozens of companies-including e-book pioneers and established publishing firms such as R.R. Donnelly, Penguin Putnam, Nokia, Barnes & Noble and Microsoft-have joined to create an open e-book standard, so that book-lovers will be able to read any title on any e-book. 
There have also been some incredible technological breakthroughs that will make it much easier to read long texts on a screen. Microsoft has developed a font display technology called ClearType that, by manipulating the red, green and blue sub-pixels that make up the pixels on an Lcn screen, improves resolution by up to a factor of three. Coupled with the latest e-book reading software and hardware, this provides an on-screen reading experience that begins to rival paper. 
But why would anyone prefer an e-- book to a p-book, regardless of improved readability? Because e-books have many other advantages. You will get instant delivery from your web bookshop to your e-book, and be able to store hundreds of novels on a device the size of a paperback. E-book technology enables you to have an entire library in your pocket. Or you can keep it on your PC-a modern laptop can hold more than 30,000 books. You won't have to wait for out-of-stock books to be ordered, and books will never go out of ""print"". Your children will be able to listen to unfamiliar words pronounced for them as they read. You will have unabridged audio synchronised to the text, so you can continue the story in situations where you are unable to read-for example, while driving. 
In addition, e-books promise to revolutionise the way the world reads. Whereas paper books are stand-alone entities, e-books can include hypertext links to additional content, whether it is in other books, databases or web sites. So e-books will not be restricted to a linear structure that is the same for everyone-every reader will be free to make use of the links, images and sounds dif ferently. You will also be able to customise e-books by adding your own notes, links and images. In a paper book, content is fixed; with e-book technology it is flexible. Finally, you will be able to get sound and moving images to support the text, creating an entirely new multimedium. 
The e-book will also revolutionise the economics of the industry. The cost of publishing books will fall dramatically, the result of savings on materials, labour, manufacturing and distribution. In the process, a lot of trees will also be saved and even the most obscure author will be able to self-publish, which means more choice for readers. The retail price of books will fall; sales will explode. 
It is hard to imagine today, but one of the greatest contributions of e-books may eventually be in improving literacy and education in less-developed countries. Today people in poor countries cannot afford to buy books and rarely have access to a library. But in a few years, as the cost of hardware continues to decline, it will be possible to set up ""virtual"" public libraries which will have access to the same content as the Library of Congress. 
An asteroid probably wiped out 
the dinosaurs. Do humans have a 
similar fate? NASA's Near Earth Asteroid Rendezvous spacecraft will start orbiting Asteroid ""433 Eros"", the first of our efforts to know the enemy.  1999 European corporate finance is mid-way through a vast change. The past few years have brought what seemed like a wave of Americanisation. In fact, it was a trickle. The tidal wave arrives in 2000. In the coming years, Europe's biggest companies will swap their equity for debt, changing the whole profile of European finance. 
As with much else in modern economics, the root cause is disinflation. Over the past 30 inflationary years, investors have been interested in little besides equity, because dividends, being variable, can be adapted to rising prices. But equity is risky. Holders are the last to benefit in the event of a liquidation. It is a post-tax cost. It is therefore an expensive form of finance. Debt, by contrast, is less risky and a fixed, pre-tax cost. So the supply of equity is drying up. Companies are either taking themselves off the stockmarket or buying in their equity. 
What about demand? The demographic bulge created by the baby boom after the second world war has generally had a prosperous and satisfying life. It is now approaching the age of retirement. If you wanted to swap a lump sum in savings for a regular cash income, how would you do it? 
The stockmarket? Lucent Technologies, a key supplier of hardware to the Internet and a darling of the stockmarket, produced a capital return of nearly 80% in the 12 months to September 1999. That's a sweet profit. But Lucent's yield-the amount it returns in dividend income per dollar investedis currently a tenth of a cent in the dollar, 0.1%. Microsoft, an even better known success story, yields nothing. 
These cases are exceptional, of course. But they illustrate the lie of markets as a whole. The average British equity yields 2.5%. In the United States it is 1.3% and in Japan 0.7%. Moreover, average equity yields are falling. High-yield stocks are the ones switching to debt. In the United Kingdom in 1999, with few exceptions, new equity was issued exclusively by low-yield, highly valued, new technology companies, the Lucents and Microsofts of the future. 
What about government bonds? They still carry a yield and in many leading markets they are near enough to riskfree. True, but with the end of inflation government yields are increasingly reflecting that lack of risk. The difference in yield between a three-month American dollar deposit and a 30-year Treasury bond is scarcely more than one percentage point. In the United Kingdom, the yield on a 30-year government bond is, crazily, 0.5% lower than the interest rate on a three-month deposit. Meanwhile, a 30-year Japanese government bond currently yields 2.7% in total. 
Over the medium to longer term the yield on government stock is likely to continue to decline. This is because the supply is drying up. With the Republican bill to cut taxes having run into the presidential veto, it seems all but certain that the federal surplus that is currently accumulating in the United States will be used to pay down public debt. More important, the word on the campaign trail is that this is what voters want. The resuit will be a reduction in the Treasury market of nearly a third over the next ten years. Excepting Japan, a similar story can be told of most other rich countries, even including Italy. 
Compare the following. A bond issued by the Halifax, a British mortgage lender, paying interest at 9.4% and with 21 years to run, now yields 6.3%. This is 1.3 percentage points higher than the equivalent government bond and three percentage points above the Halifax's own dividend yield. The Halifax has a double-A credit rating, not much below that of a government. Rupert Murdoch's BSkyB, with a triple-B rating, yields 8.1% on its ten-year bondnearly three percentage points more than the equivalent government bond and 7.6 points above BSkyB's dividend yield. 
The spreads in the United States are equally attractive. A ten-year bond issued by Ford yields 7.3%, compared with less than 6% for the comparable Treasury. A 20-year bond issued by Sprint, a successful telephone company with a credit rating equivalent to BSkyB, yields 9.3%, against the 6% current yield on the 30-year Treasury. But buy Sprint's equity on the stockmarket and you will only get a dividend of about 1%. 
In the first nine months of 1999 some $30 billion went out of the British equity market by way of share buybacks, while about $45 billion was raised in new capital through issues of sterling corporate bonds. This is but a pointer for 2000. The figures for the United States are in similar proportion, but it is in Europe as a whole that there is the potential for enormous growth. Corporate gearing in the United States is above 60%, three-quarters of which is obtained through the bond markets. In Europe, gearing is below 30%, with less than a third of debt sourced through the bond markets. So expect changes in 2000. Less equity. More debt.  1999 Reading on paper is so much a part of our lives that it is hard to imagine anything could ever replace inky marks on shredded trees. Since Johannes Gutenberg invented an economical way to make movable metal type in the 15th century, making it possible to produce reading matter quickly, comparatively cheaply and in large quantities, the printed word has proved amazingly resilient.

The World Wide Web offers an amazingly flexible way to deliver books in bits-and as investments in broadband infrastructure increase, it will get even easier to stock an e-library. And dozens of companies-including e-book pioneers and established publishing firms such as R.R. Donnelly, Penguin Putnam, Nokia, Barnes & Noble and Microsoft-have joined to create an open e-book standard, so that book-lovers will be able to read any title on any e-book. 
There have also been some incredible technological breakthroughs that will make it much easier to read long texts on a screen. Microsoft has developed a font display technology called ClearType that, by manipulating the red, green and blue sub-pixels that make up the pixels on an Lcn screen, improves resolution by up to a factor of three. Coupled with the latest e-book reading software and hardware, this provides an on-screen reading experience that begins to rival paper. 
But why would anyone prefer an a book to a p-book, regardless of improved readability? Because e-books have many other advantages. You will get instant delivery from your web bookshop to your e-book, and be able to store hundreds of novels on a device the size of a paperback. E-book technology enables you to have an entire library in your pocket. Or you can keep it on your Pc-a modern laptop can hold more than 30,000 books. You won't have to wait for out-of-stock books to be ordered, and books will never go out of ""print"". Your children will be able to listen to unfamiliar words pronounced for them as they read. You will have unabridged audio synchronised to the text, so you can continue the story in situations where you are unable to read-for example, while driving. 
In addition, e-books promise to revolutionise the way the world reads. Whereas paper books are stand-alone entities, e-books can include hypertext links to additional content, whether it is in other books, databases or web sites. So e-books will not be restricted to a linear structure that is the same for everyone-every reader will be free to make use of the links, images and sounds dif ferently. You will also be able to customise e-books by adding your own notes, links and images. In a paper book, content is fixed; with e-book technology it is flexible. Finally, you will be able to get sound and moving images to support the text, creating an entirely new multimedium. 
The e-book will also revolutionise the economics of the industry. The cost of publishing books will fall dramatically, the result of savings on materials, labour, manufacturing and distribution. In the process, a lot of trees will also be saved and even the most obscure author will be able to self-publish, which means more choice for readers. The retail price of books will fall; sales will explode. 
It is hard to imagine today, but one of the greatest contributions of e-books may eventually be in improving literacy and education in less-developed countries. Today people in poor countries cannot afford to buy books and rarely have access to a library. But in a few years, as the cost of hardware continues to decline, it will be possible to set up ""virtual"" public libraries which will have access to the same content as the Library of Congress. 
An asteroid probably wiped out the dinosaurs. Do humans have a similar fate? NASA's Near Earth Asteroid Rendezvous spacecraft will start orbiting Asteroid ""433 Eros"", the first of our efforts to know the enemy. 
Bill Gates: chairman of Microsoft.  1999 If you take the game of life seriously, if you take your nervous system seriously, if you take your sense organs seriously, then, over the course of this coming year, you must turn on, tune in and drop out. And buy up too, if you are one of millions of patients now heeding Timothy Leary's advice and turning to complementary medicine. Over two-fifths of Americans will use some sort of unconventional therapy, according to David Eisenberg, at Boston's Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Centre. Almost half of all Germans and perhaps a third of Britons will also try acupuncture, chiropracty, herbal remedies or some other complementary treatment for relief. 
Leary, who knew a thing or two about drugs, would have been pleased. So too are the growing ranks of complementary practitioners and firms producing dietary supplements and herbal compounds. Dr Eisenberg's surveys estimate that Americans paid 629m visits to complementary therapists in 1997, a 46% increase since 1990 and almost two-thirds more consultations than mainstream primary care doctors performed. Americans will spend some $30 billion on complementary treatments, much of it out of their own pockets. In Britain, France and Germany, there will be a similar boom. 
This hardly surprises William Haskell of Stanford University's Complementary and Alternative Medicine Research Programme. Although the popularity of complementary treatments differs from country to country (the French, for example, are keener on homeopathy than Americans, who favour chiropracty), their general success is driven by much the same forces. Patients are increasingly frustrated with the limitations of mainstream, western medicine to deal with their complaints. Conventional medicine is only starting to come to grips with ill-defined chronic ailments, such as memory loss, and lifestyle complaints, among them impotence, which will increasingly plague the world's ageing population. 
Much of complementary medicine, however, from spinal alignment to traditional Chinese herbs, is pitched at just these long-term imbalances; users see them not only as a means of relieving disease in the sick, but of promoting health in the worried well. As America's private medical providers, the health maintenance organisations, try to live up to their name and reduce their costs, Dr Haskell believes they will start to include complementary medicine in their basic coverage, further enhancing its popularity. Although fiscal pressures are forcing some countries, such as France, to question the state's subsidy of complementary therapies, consumer demand is likely to increase government reimbursement in the coming years. 
Of course, the appeal of complementary medicine lies not only in the counter-culture, but in the over-thecounter-culture as well. Many patients, better informed about health and keen for a greater say in their medical treatment, choose complementary therapies precisely because they have the freedom to do so without prescription. In America, almost half of all complementary medicine is do-it-yourself care. When patients do visit a complementary practitioner, many find the interaction far more rewarding than a trip to the general practitioner. Since much of complementary medicine focuses on broad holistic factors, such as diet or emotional state, consultations are usually longer and wider-ranging than a busy primary care physician can afford. 
Western medicine, however, is very nimble in adopting tricks from other disciplines and from different cultures. In America, mainstream multinational prescription-drug companies, such as American Home Products and Bayer, have launched brands of herbal supplements to take advantage of the $2.6 billion market, which is expected to more than double by 2003. Almost two-thirds of American medical schools now teach courses in complementary medicine and older practising physicians, while perhaps not embracing complementary medicine, at least no longer dismiss it. Even in China where traditional and western medical practice have existed side-by-side for years, Dr Eisenberg notes growing moves among practitioners to combine the best elements of both. Indeed, where once complementary medicine was known as ""alternative"" (or worse), watch for the spread of ""integrative"" medical clinics in the coming year. 
Science will drive many complementary therapies into mainstream clinical practice, and others into the bin. At the moment, there are few authoritative clinical trials or laboratory tests to assess the claims of such treatments. That is set to change as a number of large clinical trials, co-ordinated by America's National Centre for Complementary and Alternative Medicine, take place in 2000. They will establish whether, say, St John's Wort is better at relieving mild depression than Prozac or if shark's cartilage is any good for lung cancer. 
Such proof will come in handy as complementary remedies confront the regulators. Unlike conventional drugs, dietary supplements can be sold in America without prior approval from the federal Food and Drug Administration, which strikes many critics as an unsound, unsafe arrangement. 
Some firms, among them Britain's Phytopharm, are trying to rescue herbal mixtures from the hinterland of dietary supplements and establish them as a new class of drug with full regulatory approval. As the ancient Chinese proverb says, ""Real gold is not afraid of the hottest fire."" In 2000, complementary medicine will have to prove its mettle. 
Britain's University for Industry begins full operations. It will run a nationwide network of 1,000 learning centres. 
Shereen El Feki: health care correspondent, The Economist.  1999 And you thought there was only one Internet? Internet2 (I2) is an American university-led venture, which is being used to create the Internet infrastructure of the future. In 2000, campus networks will gain access to a vastly improved form of multicasting and the revolutionary Quality of Service (Qos). What is more, companies will soon begin to enjoy the fruits of these high-tech endeavours. 
The 12 network is named ""Abilene"", after the railhead that opened America's west. It is based on a new protocol, IPv6-you currently use IPv4-and currently wires up 150 universities. This protocol has massive capacity, is super-reliable and is much, much faster than today's congested info-highway. Abilene can transfer data at 2.4 gigabits a second, 45,000 times faster than a typical modem; imagine ten encyclopedias sent around the world in less than a second. 
Multicast technology allows the same packet of information to be sent to multiple locations. It is already used by 3,000 radio stations, which multicast their audio over the Internet. The magic of IPv6 is that it guarantees image and audio transmission without delay, jerkiness or the odd frame getting lost. It opens the way for web-based television. 
IPv6 also lifts the curtain on Qos. This solves an important part of the net congestion problem by guaranteeing reliable broadband width. Crucially, traffic can be prioritised and delivered almost instantly. Abilene may also soon be transmitting holographic images and its creators are working on a sense of touch. 
In 2000, multicasting will be rolled out on to the campus for further testing. Of course, keeping America's big corporations off the systeman Internet purist's dream-is impossible, not least because they are partially funding the experiment. AT&T, Microsoft, isM, Cisco, MCI WorldCom/Sprint and others are contributing around $50m to the project in the hope that they can use the technology in building company intranets. This will ensure America's decisive lead in Internet technology for another decade.  1999 The first ""working draft"" of the human genome-the digital recipe of our genes -is scheduled to be published early in 2000. It represents a critical milestone in the mammoth international project to decode the entire genetic sequence of man. It will also mark the beginning of a new era in personalised medicine in which a patient's genetic make-up is used to predict and treat illnesses with drugs tailor-made for an individual's inherited predispositions. 
Competing organisations are racing to be the first to sequence and decipher the three billion letters that make up the complete genetic code of human DNA. On one side is the combined might of the American government and the Wellcome Trust, the world's largest medical research charity, which are stumping up most of the $3 billion being spent on the Human Genome Project. On the other is a small, select band of privateers who, with highly specialised equipment and computers, are able to carry out ""fast and dirty"" decoding, which they hope to protect with patents and so reap vast sums from pharmaceutical companies that will need the data for the development of new drugs and medicines. 
One such private operation is run by Craig Venter, a maverick scientist who became disillusioned with the official genome project and so established his own operation with the help of venture capital. His company, Celera Genomics, and its sister operation, the Institute of Genomic Research, in Rockville, Maryland, are the most serious competitors to the publicly funded sequencing project. 
Dr Venter has pioneered a quick method of decoding the genome that was famously derided by James Watson-the co-discoverer of the nrra helix and founding father of the Human Genome Project-as work that ""any monkey"" could do. Celera, however, has already sequenced the entire genetic code of several micro-organisms and has promised a full sequence of the human genome by 2001, two years ahead of the final completion date fixed by the Human Genome Project. In order to recoup the investment in the vast number-crunching operation, Dr Venter intends to charge a fee for organisations to access his genetic database of DNA sequences. 
However, in a deft move aimed at undermining the threat posed by Dr Venter and others, the Human Genome Project has established a consortium which over the next couple of years will throw enormous effort into finding the crucial bits of the human genome that are set to become vital elements of the medicine of the 21st century. The Wellcome Trust is spearheading the consortium along with four of America's most prestigious genetics centres- the Whitehead Institute for Biomedical Research, Washington University School of Medicine, Stanford Human Genome Center and the Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory. The backers that will finance the project's initial $45m include the leading pharmaceutical businesses. 
The main goal of the consortium is to find the genetic signposts of disease and to publish them on the Internet as soon as they are decoded, thereby preventing others like Dr Venter from patenting the same information. These particular signposts are known as single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPS, pronounced ""snips""). They represent the smallest change possible in a gene and as such the genetic difference between one person and another is in effect the result of the differences in their stirs. For every 1,000 ""letters"" in the code of a human gene, there is typically one stir. This means that two unrelated people have, very roughly, a million stirs to distinguish between them. 
SNPS are the ultimate genetic landmarks and will enable scientists to navigate the vast open spaces of the human genome. They are the fine-grained physical features that enable the genetic mapmakers to locate their precise position and, in doing so, to decide whether that particular region of human DNa is medically useful or important. 
SNPS have the advantage of being highly stable. They don't change from one generation to another like some other genetic markers. They are evenly and frequently spaced through the genome (a prerequisite of any good signpost), and they are simple (representing the smallest form of genetic change possible). The consortium believes that building up a map of sNPs will be at the heart of personalised medicine, shifting the focus of treatment from what works best for the majority to what works best for each individual, based on their unique genetic inheritance. 
Conventional genetic tests are used on disorders caused by defects in single genes-such as cystic fibrosis or Huntington's disease. New tests based on patterns of stirs will enable doctors to estimate a person's predispositions to a range of other disorders, from asthma and cancer to diabetes and senile dementia, where a number of predisposition genes are thought to be influential. If heart disease tends to run in your family, there should be a set of SNPS that could be used to estimate your risk of heart attack. 
Another, more intriguing, function of an SNP map is in the design, development and use of new drugs. It is well established that some people, for no apparent reason but probably related to their genes, suffer serious side-effects to drugs. sNPS might prove useful in helping to identify those people who will respond best to a certain drug. The new science of pharmacogenomics should make drug prescription less of a hit-or-miss affair. It opens the way for doctors to prescribe more tailor-made medicines that recognise our unique genetic individuality. 
Research under way promises a revolution in medicine. The race between the competitors should, by the end of 2000, decide who picks up the glittering prizes. 
Steve Connor: science editor of The Independent.  1999 Astronomers are currently enjoying a construction boom. The white and silver domes of new telescopes have been popping up like giant mushrooms on otherwise barren mountain-tops in Hawaii and Chile. Many of these will open for business in 2000, causing astronomers' productivity to rise sharply. In the southern hemisphere, in particular, the new observatories will increase the amount of light that astronomers can study by a factor of five. 
It might seem ill-advised, then, to predict that the most surprising (and therefore important) advances in astronomy in 2000 will not be made by studying light. Nevertheless, it is a safe bet. The headline discoveries will belong to those astronomers who study light's shorter-wavelength cousins: x-rays. 
This is not to belittle the new Hawaiian and Chilean telescopes-they are huge. The bigger a telescope's mirror, the dimmer the objects it can see. Each of the new observatories has a primary mirror eight metres in diameter. This makes the previous generation of four-- metre telescopes look puny. 
They are also equipped with the very latest stargazing gadgetry, including the ability to deform their mirrors under computer control, to cancel the blurring and twinkling effects of the atmosphere. This combination of bigness and sharpness makes the new 8-metre class wellsuited to study the remotest objects visible from Earth-the universe's oldest galaxies. By revealing the differences between these ancient galaxies and present-day ones, the new telescopes will help astronomers learn how galaxies change over billions of years, and how galaxies were formed in the first place. 
Impressive as that may be, the new machines are simply bigger and more numerous versions of instruments that already exist. They do not even break any size records-the twin Keck telescopes already sitting on Mauna Kea in Hawaii each measure 10 metres across. 
The real surprises in 2000 will come from celestial x-rays, since two new xray telescopes are about to enter terrain that is almost completely unexplored. An x-ray telescope must be perched in space, rather than on an arid mountaintop, because the atmosphere does not merely blur x-rays; it devours them. This is lucky for humans, who would otherwise be zapped by the sun's x-rays, but it means that x-ray astronomy lags behind that of ordinary light. Each x-ray mission is risky and expensive, but potentially very significant. 
The Chandra X-ray Observatory was launched in July 1999 into a high, lazy orbit taking it one-third of the way to the Moon and back. Throughout 2000 (and for five or ten years more) it will be taking x-ray pictures of the universe with unprecedented clarity. In that sense, Chandra is the x-ray equivalent of the Hubble Space Telescope (and also in the sense that it was paid for by NASA, America's space agency, to the tune of $1.4 billion). Not to be outdone, in early 2000 the European Space Agency will launch the X-ray Multi-Mirror (xMM) telescope, which will have even bigger mirrors than Chandra. 
Many different things in the universe emit x-rays, but they all share one common attribute: they are outrageously hot. Well past red-hot and blue-hot, to be x-- hot requires a temperature of tens or hundreds of millions of degrees. X-rays are produced, for example, when a particularly large star runs out of fuel and explodes. Or, if a black hole is close enough to a star to suck away the star's outer layers, the ripped material gets hot enough to emit x-rays. In short, x-rays mark the spots of celestial violence. 
Chandra and XMM will provide much sharper images of all these phenomena. What appear presently to be nebulous blobs of emission might turn out to contain filaments or spots that will reveal what is really going on. 
Joshua Winn: doctoral student in astronomy at hnr.  1999 Global warming will preoccupy the next generation, predicts Sir John Houghton, of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. 
One hundred years ago Claude Monet painted scenes of London through its smoggy atmosphere. That was local pollution. What is relatively new and more worrying is global pollution-that is pollution emitted by people locally that has global effects. The first example to emerge was damage to the earth's ozone layer. International action was promptly taken through the Montreal Protocol to phase out the use of the chemicals responsible. Although full recovery of the ozone layer will now happen, it will take at least a century. 
Another example is pollution that leads to global warming and climate change. Carbon dioxide and other ""greenhouse"" gases such as methane are released into the atmosphere through the burning of fossil fuels (coal, oil and gas) and also through deforestation. These gases absorb ""heat"" radiation emitted by the earth's surface that would otherwise be lost to space, so maintaining the surface and the lower atmosphere at a warmer level than normal. 
The amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere has already increased by over 30% since 1750 and, if no action is taken to stem the increase, it will reach double its preindustrial value during the second half of the 21st century. As a result, the average rate of warming of the climate is expected to be greater than at any time during the past 10,000 years. This is not of itself necessarily bad; some communities will experience a net benefit. But many ecosystems as well as humans will find it difficult, if not impossible, to adapt. 
Although there is a lot of uncertainty concerning the detail, the basic science underlying global warming and climate change is well understood. It is not in question. Hundreds of scientists from over 50 countries have contributed as authors or reviewers to the assessments of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (trcc). Because of the uncertainties it is easy either to exaggerate the possible impacts to calamitous proportions or to suggest that too little is known to justify any action. What the iPCC has done is explain clearly what is known together with the major uncertainties. Then, taking account of all relevant scientific data, best estimates have been provided of climate change and its impact over the next century. Here are a few of the ipcc's main findings and an outline of the agenda for the years ahead. 
First, largely because of the thermal expansion of ocean water and the accelerated melting of glaciers, sea levels are likely to rise by approximately half a metre by 2100. Therefore, sea defences in many coastal regions will need to be improved, albeit at considerable cost. However, adaptation is just not possible for countries with large river deltas such as Bangladesh, Southern China and Egypt, and for many island states in the Pacific. 
A second major result of global warming will be, on average, a more intense hydrological cycle leading to impacts on water distribution and availability. In many areas heavy rainfall will tend to become heavier while some semi-arid areas will receive less rainfall. There will be more frequent and more intense floods or droughts, especially in sub-tropical areas. Since, in many places, water is rapidly becoming a critical resource and since floods and droughts are the natural disasters that already cause most deaths, misery and economic damage, these could represent the most damaging impacts of global warming. When combined with the rise in sea levels, a recent study has estimated that this could lead to 150m environmental refugees by 2050. 
Three widely accepted principles will govern the international agreements needed to meet this threat. The first is the ""Precautionary Principle"", already clearly imbedded in the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change agreed at the Earth Summit in Rio in 1992. This states that the existence of uncertainty should not preclude the taking of appropriate action. The reason for such action is simply stated as the stabilisation of the concentrations of greenhouse gases (such as carbon dioxide) in the atmosphere in ways that allow also for necessary economic development. The second principle is the ""Polluter Pays Principle"", which implies the imposition of measures such as carbon taxes or carbon trading arrangements. The third is the ""Principle of Equity (both Intergenerational and International)"" which is the most difficult to apply. However, a proposal of the Global Commons Institute that is being widely discussed applies the second and third principles by allowing eventually for the allocation of carbon emissions to nations on an equal per capita basis while also allowing for emissions trading. 
The action agreed at Kyoto in 1997 is a first step. Necessary post-Kyoto action, however, will be more demanding. The rate of increase of global emissions must first be substantially slowed; then there must be reductions in these emissions to well below 1990 levels before the end of the next century. Many of the required technologies to bring about these reductions are already available, but they require adequate resources for investment and development. Studies show that the necessary action may cost around 1% of the total world product, much less than the likely cost of damage and adaptation if there is no action. 
If human communities are to be fulfilled and creative, they not only need goals related to their economic performance but also moral and spiritual goals. Care for the overall health of the planet is such a goal. It demands action by scientists to provide better information about likely climate change, by governments to set the necessary frameworks for change, by business and industry to seize the opportunities for innovation and the introduction of new technologies, and by all world citizens to support the action being taken and contribute to it.  1999 President Clinton was impeached by the House of Representatives on two counts-perjury before a grand jury and obstruction ol justice-arising from his concealment of his affair with Monica Lewinsky. Yet the public continued to support the president: in November's elections, his party, the Democrats, gained House seats midway through a Democratic term for the first time since the 1930s. 
Governor George Bush of Texas won thunderous reelection to position himself for the Republican nomination for president in 2ooo. The worst natural disaster in modern history hit Central America when Hurricane Mitch swept through the region, killing thousands and shattering the economies of Nicaragua, Honduras and Guatemala. 
General Augusto Pinochet, Chile's ex-dictator, was arrested in London at the request of a Spanish magistrate, who is seeking to put him on trial for murder, torture and genocide. The general's arrest made legal history, dividing Chileans and provoking protests from their government. 
In Brazil, President Fernando Henrique Cardoso comfortably won a second term in an election in October despite, or because of, a financial crisis which threatened to undermine the country's new-found price and currency stability. Six years after staging a bloody but failed military coup in Venezuela, Hugo Chavez won his country's presidency through the ballot box, on a populist platform. The separatist Parti Quebecois retained power in provincial elections in Quebec But a lower share of the vote reduced the prospects of a third referendum on independence. 
Bloody street riots caused Indonesia's President Suharto to step down after 32 years. He was replaced by his protege, BJ. Habibie; unrest soon returned. 
A veteran opposition leader, Kim Dae Jung, became president of South Korea and freed 2,300 prisoners. Malaysia's prime minister, Mahathir Mohamad, sacked his deputy, Anwar Ibrahim, and had him tried for corruption and sexual crimes. Mr Anwar claimed it was all a conspiracy. 
A Hindu-nationalist party, the BJP, formed a new government in India. Soon after, both India and Pakistan conducted nuclear tests and tension in Kashmir grew. John Howard was re-elected in Australia with a mandate to introduce a new goodsand-services tax. 
Pol Pot, leader of the Khmers Rouges, died in Cambodia. Devastating floods in China, Bangladesh and South Korea displaced millions. A tidal wave in Papua New Guinea killed 2,ooo people. 
Little change 
After an i8-month IsraeliPalestinian impasse, Bill Clinton stage-managed an interim deal between Binyamin Netanyahu and Yasser Arafat at an American summit in October. Mr Clinton then visited Mr Arafat in Gaza. But opposition to the deal in Israel's cabinet led Mr Netanyahu to decide on an early election next May. 
Two crises between Iraq and the UN arms inspectors were resolved just ahead of American bombing raids. A third one, in December, was not, and the Americans and British carried out a four-day air attack. Saddam Hussein said the inspectors would not be allowed back. 
Congolese rebels, backed by Uganda and Rwanda, set out from eastern Congo to overthrow Laurent Kabila. Angola, Zimbabwe and Namibia sent troops to protect the president. Peace efforts failed and the war became a stalemate. 
The American embassies in Nairobi and Dar es Salaam were bombed, killing 250 people, nearly all African. America blamed Osama bin Laden, a Saudi dissident, and bombed his camps in Afghanistan and a pharmaceuticals factory in Sudan. 
Sani Abacha, Nigeria's military dictator, died of a heart attack. His successor, Abdulsalam Abubakar, released political prisoners and announced elections next February at which new political parties would compete. 
Leftward bent 
By the end of 1998 left-ofcentre parties were in power, usually in coalitions, in 13 out of the European Union's 15 countries. Right-of-centre governments ruled the roost only in Spain and Ireland. 
In Germany Helmut Kohl and his Christian Democrats were beaten in a general election by Gerhard Schroder and the Social Democrats, who formed a coalition government with the Greens. 
Politics and the economy in Russia became ever more chaotic. An ailing Boris Yeltsin sacked two prime ministers and said he would stay as president until mid-2000. Voters north and south of the Irish border approved an agreement intended to bring peace to Northern Ireland But rows continued. 
A fragile peace survived in Bosnia, but its people continued to vote for leaders along largely ethnic lines. Civil war broke out in the south Serbian province of Kosovo, where the ethnic-AIbanian majority demanded independence. 
The Greek-Cypriot government of Cyprus decided not to deploy Russian surface-toair missiles, which Turkey had threatened to blitz. The Basque separatist guerrilla group ETA declared peace in Spain.  1999 To the brink 
Global GDP growth fell by half to less than 2% and the world teetered on the edge of the worst financial crisis since the 193os. Russia defaulted on its domestic debts in August; Long-Term Capital Management, a big hedge fund, nearly collapsed. Fears of a global credit crunch were eased only after America's Federal Reserve cut interest rates three times. 
Deflation surfaced. In dollar terms, commodity and oil prices sank to levels not seen since 1986. In real terms, The Economist industrials commodity price index fell to its lowest since the 193os and oil prices to their lowest in 25 years. Even the prices of finished goods fell in several countries, squeezing the average inflation rate in the G7 economies to a 4o-year low. 
As international capital flows dried up, the emerging economies submerged. Much of East Asia plunged into deep recession; Russia's economy imploded; and, by the end of the year, Brazil's economy was shrinking, after $30 billion had been spent defending its currency. Such was the demand for financial rescues that the IMF almost ran out of money; but at the last minute America's Congress approved new funds. 
Japan's economy went from bad to dreadful. By October, it had contracted for four quarters in a row, despite umpteen fiscal-stimulus packages. The Nikkei average tumbled to 12,880 in October, its lowest level for 13 years. 
Most of the other rich economies flourished. America's economy expanded by an estimated 3.5%, driven by falling import prices and rampant consumer spending on the back of stockmarket gains. Wall Street plunged by 20% during the summer, but it then recovered, to leave the Dow up 17% over the year. 
Asian banks wobbled. In Japan, the passage of a Y60 trillion ($500 billion) bank-aid package allowed the government to nationalise LongTerm Credit Bank and Nippon Credit Bank, two of the duffest lenders. The two insolvent banks had assets equal to 7% of Japan's GDP. In China GITIC, a big investment group, collapsed. 
The urge to merge 
It was the world's biggest ever year for mergers and acquisitions: they surpassed $2.4 trillion, 50% above 1997's total. American companies made two-thirds of the deals. Biggest of all in value terms was the union of two oil giants, Exxon and Mobil, announced in December: it will create the world's biggest company in revenue terms. 
About a quarter of deals by volume were cross-border. Daimler-Benz, a German car maker, joined Chrysler in the largest foreign takeover of an American firm. In drugs, parts of the biggest French and German firms, RhonePoulenc and Hoechst, merged; as did Britain's Zeneca with Sweden's Astra. 
Big banks got even bigger. Citicorp joined Travelers in the largest ever financial-services merger. A week later came news of another whopper: the merger of BankAmerica and NationsBank to form America's second biggest bank. Germany's Deutsche Bank paid $io billion for Bankers Trust, America's ninth biggest, which had been driven into loss by the emerging-markets crisis. 
In the digital world, convergence continued Compaq, a hungry Pc-maker, gobbled Digital Equipment Corporation; and America Online, the best-known Internet service provider, paid $4.2 billion for Netscape, populariser of the web-browser. In telecoms, WorldCom merged with MCI, a long-distance company. A re-energised AT&T bought TCI, America's leading cable operator, and linked with Britain's BT. 
Media mergers went transatlantic. Canada's Seagram, which owns Universal Studios, bought PolyGram, Philips's music-and-films arm, for $10.6 billion. In doing so it destroyed the nearest thing Europe had to a film studio. Bertelsmann, Germany's media giant, bought Random House for a rumoured $1.5 billion, thus becoming the world's largest Englishlanguage publisher. 
Europe came closer to having a single stockmarket when the Frankfurt and London stock exchanges decided to trade jointly Europe's top blue-chip shares. Other European exchanges said they were keen to join. 
Sic transit 
Robert Crandall, tough boss of American Airlines for three decades, stepped down. Alex Trotman, boss of Ford (and now a lord), quit earlier than expected. So did Anna Murdoch, who left her husband Rupert and the board of News Corp. 
Pfizer launched Viagra, a cure for impotence, but later had to attach a warning about side-effects. Gillette launched a sharp new razor, but later had to cut jobs. America's tobacco companies fought suits from state governments in court, but then settled their legal rows and took large charges. 
America's Department of Justice launched an epic antitrust case against Microsoft. Whatever the verdict, an appeal is certain, and the case is doubtless destined for the Supreme Court. 
Switzerland's two largest banks, UBs and Credit Suisse, buckled under a mounting pile of class-action suits and agreed to pay Holocaust survivon $1.25 billion. 
Hong Kong and Malaysia opened new airports, among the world's largest, just as the region's economic crisis cut back air travel. Both suffered expensive teething troubles.  1999 The Economist, 25 St James's Street, London swi iec FAx : 0171 839 2968 E-MAIL : [email protected] 
No apology necessary 
SIR-I have never been able to accept what many Japanese opinion makers never tire of telling us to do: to ""apologise"" to the Chinese for ""crimes"" our fathers and grandfathers committed in China (""Japan in the right"", December 5th). Conveniently they forget to tell us that China's communist leadership far outdid the Japanese imperial army in the killing of their people. They did so to stay in power and, in my view, would not hesitate to do so again. 
Also, they do not discuss how the present Japanese army, just 150,000 strong, could become an aggressive threat to our neighhours, China included. Your point that the Chinese leadership, by seeming outraged at the non-apology of Japan's leaders, is putting Japan on the defensive and extracting a financial concession is clear to see. But again, our opinion makers seem not to see such a simple truth. 
Osaka NAOMI HAGA 
SIR-I disagree strongly with your support of Japan in its refusal to apologise to China for colonial atrocities. Your main argument is that China's rulers are a nasty bunch with no right to lecture anyone about abusing the Chinese people. In some cases it can be hard to separate attitudes towards a government from feelings about the people it represents. But surely this is not such a case. The issue pre-dates the governments and indeed governmental systems of both countries, and is one on which the Chinese leaders do speak for many of their people. 
Japan does recognise and deal with the Chinese regime, in no way regarding it as a pariah state incapable of normal relations. So if we say the Chinese get no apology because we dislike their leaders, we might as well say no one anywhere gets recognition of past wrongs unless we like their government.

Family values 
SIR-Your article on the sale of Icelandic family data (December 5th) clearly summarises the ethical problems. However, some matters need clarifying. Iceland is not inbred: inbreeding occurs when individuals preferentially marry known relatives. The effect is to lose genes, especially rare ones. This makes the remaining genes easier to find but it has little effect on common genes, whose collaborative efforts influence the risk of common disorders. Rather than its depth of ancestral documentation, the value of Iceland in these disorders is that its environment is unusually homogeneous, as are standards of living and standards of medical provision. 
In relatively rare disorders due to single genes, such as cystic fibrosis and the inherited form of breast cancer, deep ancestral studies allow a single common ancestor to be found and the position of genes to be defined through nearby genes. In common disorders many genes are usually involved and these genes may be derived from as many ancestors. 
It is difficult to see how defining more ancestors can provide much information on the common disorders whose decipherment is the main commercial attraction. It was largely the impossibility of making pedigrees both confidential and informative that led the Ethical Committee of the Icelandic Medical Council to state that it was ""completely opposed to the present bill and will advise Icelandic physicians not to participate in the setting up of the data base.""

In the pipeline 
SIR-Your article on Caspian energy (November 28th) asserts that prospects for building a main export pipeline from Baku to Ceyhan in Turkey have rarely looked so doubtful. In fact, prospects for this project have never looked better. 
In the past, many observers thought a pipeline between Baku and Supsa in Georgia could provide the optimal route for exports from offshore Azerbaijan. But during the past 12 months, companies and regional governments have realised the importance of some broader considerations. These include long-term energy security, the viability of shipping large volumes of oil through the Bosporus, and the attractiveness of a large-diameter pipeline to a port like Ceyhan, which is able to handle exports from both sides of the Caspian. 
The contention that the bulk of output from eastern Caspian producers will flow to a Russian terminal on the Black Sea may be true, but only for a limited time. Significant potential exists for boosting the proven oil reserves of Kazakhstan, both offshore and onshore. If fully realised, these additions could exceed the capacity of the Caspian Pipeline Consortium's first- and secondphase pipelines to the Russian Black Sea coast. 
In early December, Kazakhstan and three companiesChevron, Mobil and Shellagreed to study the feasibility of creating a unified system of oil and gas pipelines from western Kazakhstan to Turkey. This will be an important step towards aggregating Caspian output and enhancing the viability of the Ceyhan export route. The Azerbaijan International Operating Company, meanwhile, has said negotiations are continuing with potential transit countries. These developments, plus the likelihood of incentives from regional governments, will ultimately make Baku-Ceyhan the optimal route for Caspian oil exports.

Case for the defence 
SIR-Your special on defence (December 12th) confuses cause and effect. You say that ""the chances of aerial dogfights or naval battles"" are declining and, therefore, large industrial war machines such as ships, submarines and tanks are not worth purchasing. But why are the chances of mechanised land wars, dogfights and sea battles receding? Is it because of a fundamental change in the nature of warfare or because the overwhelming superiority of western militaries makes confrontation impractical? 
It is arguable that there is overinvestment in traditional areas but equally arguable that it is crucial to maintain an overwhelming advantage in these areas, to deter the most destructive forms of warfare. The situation is analogous to the maintenance of a nuclear deterrent to make nuclear attack uneconomical. Tacoma

The Economist, Ill West 57th Street, New York, NY 10019-2211.  1999 WITH every day that passes, matters get worse. The country is drifting along in a state of neglect. Legislative programmes are unheard of. Reformist debate has stopped. The political atmosphere is as poisonous as it has been since the 196os. Iraq is bombed, and half America-as well as much of the worldwonders at the president's motives. When Russia collapses, when markets stumble, when China gets aggressive, when the next terrorist atrocity occurs, the world still hopes America will take the lead. But how can it, when Bill Clinton is about to go on trial before the Senate? 
Everyone wants this horror-and horror is not too strong a word-to end. Had Mr Clinton resigned in August, when he was forced to admit that he had lied to his family, his colleagues and the American people, he could have finished it there. He could still do so; and would do so, if he were capable of shame or had any sense of honour. But Mr Clinton is even less inclined to resign today than he was before his impeachment. The vote to impeach was so partisan that it has rallied even wavering Democrats behind him, and has hitched the polls a few points higher in his favour. Where even the intimation of impeachment shattered Nixon, it has strengthened Bill Clinton. He will cling on to the last. 
How then can the paralysis be broken? At this point, only in two ways. The first would be a quick trial in the Senate which would probably end in acquittal but would not rule out criminal proceedings once Mr Clinton had left office. The second would be a motion of censure: constitutionally doubtful, but not objectionable, as long as it did not include immunity from future prosecution. Two things are vital here. The first is speed, to get America back to work. But more important is the second: that the president should be made to face the consequences of his perjury before the grand jury. He must be made to feel the weight of the damage he has done. 
Penance all round 
To be fair, blame for the damage should also be laid at other doors. America has been so convulsed by this scandal, and the public so revolted, because the process of bringing Mr Clinton to book has been tainted at every stage. The president was dogged by an independent counsel whose powers were excessive and whose tactics were sometimes suspect. The Supreme Court caused much of the paralysis by ruling that the Paula Jones suit against a sitting president should proceed. That suit itself was encouraged by the president's political enemies. The press-including The Economist-leapt into the Monica story with both feet. As a result, although the machinery of impeachment was gleefully cranked up, it soon felt wrong. The sense of shame and sadness that now engulfs many thoughtful Americans comes not so much from sympathy with this particular president-whose lying defiance deserves noneas from worry at the precedents that have been set for political vendettas against elected presidents in future. 
As the newyear dawns, there is some hope that the damage done will not be lasting. In the Senate, at least, there is a desperate urge for civility to undo the grandstanding rudeness shown by Republicans in the House. If the Senate performs its duties with dispatch, and above all with bipartisanship, some of the wounds may start to heal; though it may take months, and even a trouncing in next year's elections, before the Republican zealots in Congress start to grasp the havoc they have caused. 
On a point of detail (though a large one) Congress should review, and consider abolishing in its present form, the office of the independent counsel when the statute comes up for renewal this year. At present, an attorney-general has little choice but to appoint such a counsel when there seems to be evidence of executive-branch wrongdoing. But his brief is open-ended, his funding and his subpoena powers almost limitless. The present statute, a reaction against the powerless prosecutors of the Watergate era, did not envisage a Ken Starr figure let loose on the White House. The office has diminished the importance of Congress (as was seen most clearly in Watergate) in checking the excesses of the president and his men. 
The Supreme Court, too, has not emerged without bruising. As soon as a pretext arises (though America might well hope one would not arise soon), the court should revisit its ruling that sitting presidents are liable to prosecution in civil suits. The justices, like the House Republicans in turn, have sometimes seemed blustered into hardline positions by their distaste for the president's stonewalling. If calmer tempers can prevail, the three main branches of government may be able to deal with each other reasonably again. 
Yet that may take years. Although every arm of government, not merely the president, has behaved in ways they are now beginning to regret, dangerous precedents have been set. The presidency is a weakened and unattractive office, impeachment has become a purely partisan instrument, and marginal groups in Congress will now feel they have the power to overturn the mandate of the people. It is high time everyone drew back, reviewed the damage, and began to restore some of the rules and conventions that have kept America free of such traumas in the past. But the first essential is the brisk, fair and appropriate punishment of the man who, many months ago, might have spared his country all this agony by behaving as an honourable president really should.  1999 Historians may well count January 4th 1999 as an epic moment 
IT WILL happen over a holiday weekend, and in a way which leaves ordinary citizens more or less unaffected, as new notes and coins will not replace old national currencies for a further three years. But the nature of its launch on January 4th should not let anyone underestimate the importance of the creation of the euro, the new single currency for ii European Union members, nor miss its genuinely historic nature. It is the biggest risk the Eu has ever taken, but also an adventure that could transform the economic and political landscape of the continent. It is the first time that countries of anything like this number, size or global economic weight have gathered together to share a currency, and thus to pool their monetary sovereignty. It is arguably the most momentous currency innovation since the establishment of the United States dollar in 1792. 
The superlatives could go on. But is the euro to be welcomed? Yes, it is, and all should hope that it will be a success. The European Union is an imperfect creature, with some of its actions based on fine principles of political economy and some on poor ones. The intentions behind the euro fall clearly into the first category. The EU was founded in 1957 on the desire to avoid war, and many of its best achievements have also been based on another sort of disarmament: policy disarmament. For external trade, for state aids, for the singlemarket rules and others, countries have handed over powers that seemed (though generally weren't) individually desirable but were in practice mutually harmful. A similar transfer is happening now with monetary policy. The ii euro members' rights to inflate, to finance budget deficits by printing money, to boost exports temporarily by currency devaluation are being handed over to the new European Central Bank (ECB) in the most powerful way possible, by treaty. 
As with the other forms of policy disarmament, the transfer of powers to a supra-national body does not guarantee they will be used well. In trade, national protectionism has too often merely been replaced by pan-European protectionism. But the Treaty of Maastricht, which in 1991 paved the way for the ECB and the euro, gives cause for hope. The ECB has a strict and simple task: price stability. It is forbidden by treaty from bailing out a profligate government. Its independence from political interference is well entrenched. 
That said, the risks associated with the euro also begin with the treaty. To paraphrase Keynes's criticisms of the Treaty of Versailles after the first world war, treaties often solve one problem but cause the next. In the case of Maastricht, one risk is that the ECB's task will be carried out too strictly and inflexibly. But the most worrying legacy lies in the treaty's strictures about national budget deficits and in the cementing of those concerns in the later Stability and Growth Pact. As our article argues on pages 19-zz, this deprives governments of the one power which, under a monetary union, they most need: the ability to use national fiscal policy to counteract recessions which affect one member state more than the others. They have not lost this ability altogether, but it will be severely constrained. 
The danger that this raises is that in the event of a sharp recession in one or more countries, there will then be a political reaction against the EU itself The Union as a whole, and other euro members, will be blamed for the victim's inability to moderate its recession. Given that public support for the euro has been thin, to say the least, in most of the member countries (and is unlikely to grow much during the absurdly long, three-year period before people actually get hold of euro notes and coin), this is one helluva hostage to fortune. 
A United States of Europe? 
Such an outcome, if it happens, could cause a political bustup; or it could lead to more power being transferred to the EU in the worst possible circumstances, namely when the Union is deeply unpopular. But there is also a happier way to think about things. Perhaps this nasty outcome will not occur, either because no such ""asymmetric"" recession takes place or because governments, meanwhile, have dismantled the stability pact. In that event, the euro will have proved a success: its members will have achieved low inflation, and the currency will have ridden out the ups and downs of the economic cycle without itself becoming politically unpopular. That is the outcome for which everyone should be hoping during the next decade. 
What then? The answer, most probably, is that a successful euro would give a big impulse to political union between the constituent countries, something close to the founding fathers'-and Winston Churchill's-original dream. The policy disarmament of monetary union would have been shown to have worked, would by then be justifiably popular, and would have encouraged governments to seek new ways to transfer their powers to common institutions. Such a union is not inevitable. And on a decade or two's timetable it would be unlikely to be as full a union as today's United States of America. To those who hate federalism, the very thought of political unity will anyway be anathema. But this would be the right way to arrive at a closer union: after a positive experience, and with popular support. 
Even this Elysian vision must, however, take account of other likely changes. By then the EU will be bigger, with 20-3o members rather than the current 15. That fact, let alone the current division between the ii euro countries and the four, led by Britain, that have not joined, is likely to mean that the Union should become a multi-system entity, with some countries signing up to everything and others opting for a different blend. It may well prove perfectly rational, in the long term, for some EU countries to stay out of even a successful euro. But that, too, is a happy thought: a Europe that is broad as well as deep, that takes account of national differences and is not thought of as a federalising bully. If the euro succeeds in creating such a Europe, its launch on January 4th 1999 will be looked back on as really quite a moment.  1999 Not even Tony Blair can put a positive gloss on the scandal that has just claimed two of his senior ministers 
TONY BLAIR is one of the world's most admired politicians. In Britain, too, his personal popularity has remained unusually high well into the second year of his New Labour administration. But even Mr Blair will find it difficult to emerge unscathed from the scandal that led over Christmas to the abrupt resignation from the cabinet of Peter Mandelson, one of his closest political friends, along with the resignation of Geoffrey Robinson, the paymaster general, who had secretly lent Mr Mandelson 373,ooo ($630,ooo) on easy terms to buy a swanky home in London's Notting Hill. Mr Blair seems genuinely to have been kept in ignorance of this arrangement between his friends. But he has connived in letting Mr Mandelson make light of what he did. 
A letter of resignation is often the last chance politicians have to put a favourable spin on an unfavourable turn of events. If their careers are finished, it does no great harm to let them get away with it. But Mr Blair has told Mr Mandelson that his career is far from over, that he will achieve ""much, much more with us"". To drive the message home, the undisgraced former minister has been consoled by an overnight stay with the Blairs at Chequers. He is to retain various special responsibilities, such as strengthening Britain's relations with Germany. In short, his career is still very much alive. That is why he and Mr Blair cannot be allowed to get away with a truly breathtaking bit of resignation spin. 
To judge by his letter to Mr Blair, Mr Mandelson is a victim of fate, a loyal lieutenant who did nothing seriously wrong in borrowing some money from a friend, but who would sooner fall on his sword than allow the faintest hint of impropriety to taint the high ethical standards which supposedly sets New Labour apart from its Tory predecessor (see page 49). Tojudge byhis letter to Mr Mandelson, Mr Blair sees his former trade and industry secretary as a loyal chum who made a ""misjudgment"" but insisted on doing the honourable thing, paid a heavy price, and so forth. This is not just the usual humbug politicians are expected to spoon out when they get into this sort of fix. It is hypocritical nonsense. 
Far from being a willing martyr, sacrificing a glittering career for a higher cause, Mr Mandelson resigned only after the failure of an energetic attempt to brazen things out, and in the light of further disclosures that he may have been economical with the truth when applying for a mortgage. Above all, it is nonsense to portray Mr Robinson's loan as if it were only something that might look wrong to suspicious minds. It really was wrong-which is why Mr Mandelson strove so hard to keep it secret. 
Consider the sequence of events. Mr Robinson made the loan, on favourable terms, when Labour was in opposition and Mr Mandelson was at the centre of Mr Blair's inner circle. In these circumstances, Mr Mandelson must surely have wondered whether Mr Robinson's generosity was an attempt to buy position in the new government. And yet he said nothing about the loan to Mr Blair. He said nothing after the election, either, when he was made responsible for presenting government policy and Mr Robinson was made paymaster general. He said nothing when Mr Robinson's business affairs later became the stuff of controversy and the subject of scrutiny by Parliament. And, amazingly, he continued to say nothing when, as trade and industry secretary, his own department started an investigation into Mr Robinson's affairs. Not at all holier than thou 
Many people will look at this affair and wonder whether Mr Mandelson's belief that the pursuit of greatness requires a flashy house will set back the modernisers in the Labour Party. That is another story (see Bagehot, page 52). What is already clear is that the party that entered office promising to set higher standards in public life has let itself off far too lightly. Mr Mandelson pretends to see nothing wrong in failing to tell Mr Blair about his personal indebtedness to the beleaguered Mr Robinson. Mr Blair pretends to believe him. As for Mr Robinson himself, Mr Blair says that a blameless minister has been ""hounded out"". But if Mr Robinson is blameless, why did Mr Blair let him go? And if Mr Mandelson had to go, why is he promised a glittering future? It is almost enough to make you nostalgic for John Major.  1999 Taking part, it is said, is just as important as winning. This rule apparently applies as much to economic statistics as to sports 
WHEN a country competes for the first time in the Olympic games or the World Cup, it unleashes a wave of national pride-even if its athletes come last. A less well known mark of national esteem is whether a country is included in The Economists economic indicator pages (see pages 88-90). Our power to delete countries at the mere click of a mouse can, it seems, provoke international disputes. 
Disgruntled government officials and businessmen often demand to know why their country is left out. The answer is simple. New Zealand's economic policies have been more exciting (and more commendable) than Belgium's, but (given our space constraint) the criterion for inclusion in our pages on developed countries is size: Belgium may be uneventful, but its GDP is almost four times that of New Zealand's. 
Some governments wince if their country is listed among the emerging economies. Portuguese officials were cross to see their country in our emerging-markets table. Their yelps, and the fact that Portugal is now part of Europe's single-currency area, persuaded us to move it into the developed world. The unfortunate result is that Portugal has now completely disappeared from our tables. ""Why?"" demands the country's foreign minister. Because although Portugal was important in the emerging-market league (its stockmarket is relatively developed) its economy is too small to include in our league of developed countries for which we publish much more detailed economic statistics. 
Let that be a warning to Greece, which also claims that it is no longer an emerging economy. Better, perhaps, to be a big fish in a pond than a tiddler in an ocean. In the real world, promotion can sometimes lead to an even more serious fate. The IMF promoted South Korea, Hong Kong, Singapore and Taiwan from developing to advanced economy status in May 1997-only months before East Asia's financial collapse. 
Behind such disputes lies a deeper issue: the labels given to countries are out-of-date. So ""industrial economies"" are misnamed now that industrial production accounts for only one-quarter of their output-much less than in the emerging economies. And the ""emerging market"" label-itself created to provide a more positive image for the ""third world""-also looks tarnished. It once conjured up the image of dynamic economies and stockmarkets; now, with countries from Thailand, to Russia, to Brazil in deep recession, cynics have renamed them ""submerging"" markets. 
Name dropping 
Four years ago, The Economist suggested a new set of labels for country groupings: the ""paralysed"" (poor economies, such as those in Africa, that have been standing still); the ""progressing"" (emerging markets); and the ""paranoid"" (the rich countries that are terrified of competition from the progressives). But since then many progressives have become paralysed, and some, such as Malaysia, risk becoming paranoid too as they shelter their economies from global forces. 
Perhaps we should group countries according to their chances of gaining entry to our indicator pages: the puny (too small, no hope) the persistent (governments which pen the most letters of complaints and the persuasive (those with good arguments, of course, not frenetic phrases). But the only sure winners will be the patient: economies that expand by following sound policies.  1999 Only poets can now save mankind from millennium buggery 
SCARCELY a year to go, and still no one can be confident that the stroke of midnight next December 31st will not release a plague of little green bugs to usher in the new millennium. Panic is rising. Every household in Britain has been told to stock up with two weeks' supplies, presumably of spam, margarine and vindaloo curry, the national dish. Some people foresee the lights going out all over the world, as power stations crash. Others say aircraft will go demented, along with cars, trains, traffic lights, hospital equipment and the numberless other bits of high-techery that make modern life worth living (all those computer games of Christmas past). Launch-on-warning missiles will be released, nuclear weapons will start spontaneously to fizz and, if any life at all continues, stockmarkets will go into sullen decline, as a bug-induced recession of apocalyptic proportions takes hold. 
Admittedly, the bugs are not going to have it all their own way. A working-group of ""informatics"" experts, known as Y2K chiefs, has just been convened at the United Nations in New York. They have been instructed to ""address the difficulties, and facilitate a useful exchange of experiences."" 
Reassured? Of course not. It is nerds and geeks and informatics experts who got us into this fix in the first place. With the clock ticking, it is no good looking to them to get us out of it. Bring on the people who really get things done-""the trumpets which sing to battle and feel not what they inspire . . . the unacknowledged legislators of the world."" Yes, Shelley's poets are now the only ones likely to be able to make the world safe for computerised civilisation as we know it. 
And how? Well, by stopping the ticking of the damned clock. Smart-Alicks have come up with their silly ideas, such as telling your computer or microchip that 2ooo is really 1972, the most recent year to have matching dates and days of the week. If it worked, that would buy 28 years in which to solve the problem, or at least address the difficulties, and facilitate a useful exchange of experiences. An alternative would be to say, ""All right, computers, listen up: the calendar has been wrong from the start. Jesus Christ was actually born around 6Bc, so we've really passed the dreaded 2ooo mark and you didn't even notice. It wasn't so bad after all."" Or you could do a Pope Gregory, or at least a variation of his trick, which was to skip the ten days after October 4th 1582 in order to tidy up the Julian calendar, which had been losing a day a century. But whether you go forward or back, you meet this difficulty: why should computers respond any more readily to being fooled about the date than to being told the truth? 
So over to the poets, those unacknowledged legislators of the world and, of course, to those they write about: 
Your face would stop a clock, For it's so passing fair That time itself would like to stop And linger there. 
Forget other proposals, the stopped clock is the only solution to the millennium-bug problem. A pause will do everybody good: the world has been in a dreadful rush for far too long, and in many respects people are really getting ahead of themselves. Properly equipped, the poets can avert something that might be quite unpleasant. Only one thing is missing: the face they need to arrest the ticking. Let the search begin. The world has just 12 months (no little green gremlins need apply.)  1999 Europe's monetary union is neither bound to succeed nor doomed to fail. Leadership, circumstances and luck will combine to decide its fate 
THE architects of the euro, looking back this weekend on what they have achieved, are entitled to feel pleased with themselves. As recently as ten years ago, the idea of merging the European Union's national monetary systems seemed fantastic. A plan for doing it was drawn up nonetheless. Then, with the ink on this blueprint hardly dry, the forerunner of the single currency (the exchange-rate mechanism of the European Monetary System) collapsed, casting new doubt on the whole enterprise. No matter. The prime movers, Helmut Kohl in Germany and Francois Mitterrand in France, carried on regardless. On January 4th their remarkable vision becomes a reality: the currencies of the it participating members of Europe's Economic and Monetary Union will be ""irrevocably"" fused. 
To have come this far is in itself an amazing political feat. Nobody can claim that EMU was forced upon Europe's governments by force of events, still less by popular demand. Events have, if anything, conspired to wreck the plan. Europe's voters, perhaps reflecting the weight of official pro-euro propaganda, are by and large in favour, and opinion has moved further in this direction of late (see table i) However, the balance in Germany, which could prove decisive, is still quite narrow. And it is disturbing that so few voters anywhere consider themselves ""well-informed"" about the project. 
This is an initiative of extraordinary ambition, given that it is to be carried through despite quite shallow support in popular opinion. EMU is an elite project. Europe's governments are saying: Our people may not be convinced of the euro's benefits just yet, but once it is in place and they come to understand it, they will change their minds. Europe's leaders had better be right. Otherwise, when the system comes under strain, its political foundations may prove too weak to sustain it. 
Even before construction of the euro is complete, governments can point to one notable success. The past year has seen extraordinary turmoil in global financial markets. Rich-country stockmarkets and currencies have not been spared. Yet Europe has been, comparatively speaking, a safe haven. Intra-European movements in exchange rates have been tiny. This is something that the euro-ii governments had committed themselves to, but their success could not have been taken for granted a year ago. The fact is, at a time of unprecedented financial turbulence, the foreign-exchange markets regarded the promise to stabilise intra-European exchange rates as credible. Currencies have held steady and interest rates have converged: it augurs well for the transition to the new system. 
The next few years are, after all, transitional. National currencies will continue to circulate until the end of zool, albeit at permanently fixed parities. In the meantime, the European System of Central Banks undertakes to defend those parities. In principle this means that if, say, Italians decide to switch all their lire into D-marks, the supply of D-marks will be expanded without limit to accommodate them. Even now there must be some small doubt as to whether, if push comes to shove, this will happen. But if the markets continue to regard the parities as credible-as they did throughout the exceptionally severe test of the past year-then Germany's offer to finance the early retirement of Italy's currency is unlikely to be called upon. 
That danger aside, and for the moment considering EMU only in its economic aspect, two principal risks remain. The first, which will be most acute during the project's early years, is that economic policy in the euro area as a whole will be ill-judged, leading to a recession that discredits the whole venture. The other, which will remain a threat into the medium term, is that the system will prove too inflexible to cope with local (in the jargon, ""asymmetric"") economic shocks. Consider each in turn. 
Independent to a fault 
In designing EMU, the architects laid great emphasis both on the independence of the European Central Bank (ECB) and on the simplicity and severity of its anti-inflation objective. In statutory terms, at least, the ECB may well be the most independent, and most single-minded, central bank in the world. America's Federal Reserve, for instance, is required by law to take output and employment into account alongside inflation, for which no numerical target is set. In addition, the Fed is accountable to Congress, which periodically questions its top officials and sometimes tries to influence their views. The restraint that Congress and the White House show in this regard is a matter of custom, reflecting the standing which the Fed has won for itself in financial markets over many years, and not a matter of law. 
The position of the ECB is quite different. The Maastricht treaty allows for no clear accountability to any other arm of national or European government. In fact the treaty explicitly forbids the ECB and its decision-making bodies to ""seek or take instructions from Community institutions or bodies, from any government of a member state or from any other body"". It also stipulates that the proceedings of the ECB council's meetings will remain confidential. If he chose, Wim Duisenberg, the first chief of the ECB, could nonetheless announce the outcome of its deliberations, together with a commentary and forecasts justifying it. Mr Duisenberg says he is not against this sort of openness. Time will tell. The point is, everything is left for the ECB to decide: this is independence with a vengeance. 
As to aims, the treaty further stipulates that the ECB'S goal is ""price stability"", leaving the bank to decide what that means. In many other countries with ""independent"" central banks-in Britain, for instance-the government sets a target for inflation and reserves the right to change it as circumstances, in its judgment, dictate. EMU has no such escape-clause. Moreover, the bank is forbidden to balance the goal of price stability against other aims. The treaty directs the ECB to ""support the general economic policies of the Community"" but, crucially, it is to do this ""without prejudice to the objective of price stability"". 
The ECB has now defined ""price stability"" to mean inflation of less than 2% a year. In modern times, no major economy has hit such a target consistently over a run of years. America's inflation rate has averaged 3.3% over the past ten years; Germany's, despite the mighty Bundesbank, has averaged 2.8%. In short, a radically undemocratic institution has been charged to achieve, without compromise, an exceptionally demanding goal of virtually zero inflation. 
Strong evidence suggests that centralbank independence is indeed a good idea: any given level of inflation can be achieved more cheaply, in terms of forgone output and employment, if firms and workers believe that monetary policy is free from undue political pressure. The danger is that En,cu'S architects have gone too far. The European Union, with its weak parliament, is acknowledged in any case to have a ""democratic deficit"" at its centre; the powers of the new central bank will make that deficit all the greater. In economic terms, the danger is simply that the ECB will take its instructions literally-and will try to screw inflation down to nothing regardless of wider economic repercussions. 
As it happens, the circumstances seem likely to prove favourable. Forecasters at the OECD expect that output in the euro zone will grow by 212% in the coming year, with inflation remaining at about its present 12% (see table 2). This assumes that short-term interest rates in the euro area will average 3% in 1999, their current level, a full percentage point lower than the average for 1998. All that would presumably suit the ECB pretty well. But more awkward eventualities cannot be ruled out. 
One is that governments, after years of post-Maastricht squeezing and fudging of budget deficits, will ease fiscal policy too much (despite the rule forbidding it, of which more in a moment). That could put upward pressure on inflation and lead the ECB, with little headroom beneath its inflation target, to assert itself at once and raise interest rates (or delay cutting them). An early conflict of this kind between loose fiscal policy and tight monetary policy would be an extremely discouraging start. 
Another even more awkward possibility for monetary policy in EMu'S first year or two is that the OECD'S forecasts for output may prove too optimistic. This is not implausible. The health of the world economy is far from robust. With Wall Street overvalued on every historical measure, the danger of sharp falls in global equity prices in 1999 needs to be taken seriously. That in turn might prompt a worse slowdown in demand than is allowed for in the OECD's central-case forecasts. The question would then be whether the ECB would cut interest rates soon enough and far enough to avoid recession in Europe. 
If the bank waited for inflation to fall before acting, that would be too late. Yet the bank might be reluctant to act more promptly, responding to forecasts of lower inflation rather than to out-turns, as it should, for fear of undermining its credibility with the markets. 
Mr Duisenberg will prefer to err on the side of caution (that is, on the side of lower inflation and higher short-term unemployment) in any case; he will want to be judged by the euro zone's inflation record, maintaining that unemployment is none of his concern. Adding to his desire to establish a tough reputation at the outset will be his memory of the fiasco surrounding his appointment. France wanted to appoint its own candidate to the job; the other countries resisted. The absurd compromise that was settled upon allowed France to say that Mr Duisenberg will step down early in favour of its man, while Mr Duisenberg says that no such promise was made. When Mr Duisenberg comes to be tested, the price of that squabble may well be higher interest rates and fewer jobs. 
A shocking possibility 
In principle, however, a recession that threatens the euro-ii as a group is not the most difficult scenario for the ECB. Once its reputation is established and any teething troubles overcome, a system-wide problem of that kind can be dealt with perfectly well by the system-wide response of a change in interest rates. Indeed, a single central bank is arguably better equipped to deal with such a case than would be ii separate national banks, acting in an unco-ordinated way. That is why, beyond the transitional period, the larger challenge for the new system will be to deal with fluctuations that are not system-wide. 
The euro zone is not what economists call an ""optimum currency area""-that is, it is not a region whose constituent parts are affected in broadly the same way by typical economic disturbances, or among whose constituent parts labour moves freely. If it were, then no economic purpose would be served by retaining sub-European currencies. Admittedly, few if any national economies meet that ideal standard: regions within the United States often suffer asymmetric shocks because of local concentrations of particular industries, and although American labour migrates comparatively smoothly from one state to another, these shifts are by no means costless. 
The point, though, is that the euro zone is very much further from being an optimum currency area than is the United States. Disparities in relative prices (after allowing for exchange-rate fluctuations) are greater among the euro-ii than among American states; and the mobility of labour within Europe is, according to one study, only one-third of the mobility of labour within America. 
Advocates of monetary union argue that the euro will itself narrow the gap, by encouraging closer economic integration. This is quite true. However, even with the euro, the barriers of culture and language are likely to remain stronger in Europe. One perverse consequence of the euro may be that, precisely because it encourages closer integration, it will also promote greater local specialisation-increasing the chance of asymmetric shocks from that source. In sum, for many years to come, persistent national divergences in growth and unemployment are likely to recur from time to time. 
Europe's governments all acknowledge that one way to reduce the costs of these divergences is to improve the supply-side flexibility of their economies. The price of European over-regulation is a both a higher unemployment rate over time, and a greater susceptibility to a further upward ratcheting of this average or equilibrium rate of unemployment with each serious recession. The trouble is, governments have so far proved better at paying lip-service to the need for deregulation than they have at dealing with the problem. The recent shift to the left in European politics makes this remedy all the less likely to be adopted. 
That leaves macroeconomic policy. When a country with its own currency suffers a recession, it is free to cut interest rates. This stimulates demand twice over: first by lowering the cost of credit, and second by causing the currency to depreciate (which spurs exports). Countries in the euro zone will not have this option. Emigration cannot help much (as it would in the case of Michigan, say). And since Europe has only a tiny central budget, net assistance from faster-growing countries (in the form of bigget inflows of public spending and smaller outflows of taxes) will also play a far smaller part than the equivalent fiscal transactions in the United States. 
All that remains is national fiscal policy. The recession-struck economy is still free to borrow on its own behalf, thus stimulating demand and speeding its recovery. Or it would be, except for EMU'S ""Stability and Growth Pact"". This is a rule that governments agreed to at Germany's insistence, requiring budget deficits to be held to 3% of GDP or less. Violators will be fined, subject to a vote of governments, unless output has fallen by 2% or more in the year in question. 
Despite this purported flexibility, the regime (like the rules defining the ECB's aims and freedoms) is exceptionally severe. Falls in output of 2% or more are extremely unusual; far smaller downturns would cause unemployment to rise quickly and be universally regarded as ""recessions"". And the restriction is too tight in another way: governments that tried to anticipate a downturn by relaxing fiscal policy early, thereby breaching the 3% limit before output fell by 2%, would also face fines. The German doubts that led to the adoption of this procedure were exaggerated, albeit not entirely groundless. The concern was that chronic overborrowers would become even more fiscally irresponsible once they had adopted the euro, because they would no longer face the financial-market sanction of higher interest rates and (in the end) a depreciating currency. Moreover, this overborrowing would henceforth be at least partly at the expense of Germany and the other euro countries, because they would bear some of the cost of default, if it came to that. 
The fear is exaggerated because the Maastricht treaty rightly insists that the central bank cannot bail out national governments. Provided that promise is believed, and so long as the no-bail-out rule applies to other finance ministries as well as to the ECB, the markets would attach a risk premium (in the form of a higher interest rate) to borrowing by heavily indebted governments. That is as it should be-and no further discipline should be necessary. As it is, the stability pact calls that promise into doubt, by making budgets a collective responsibility. Worse, in the meantime it rules out counter-cyclical fiscal policy of the sort that will often be necessary, and for which there is no longer any plausible national substitute. 
The crucial question regarding the stability pact, therefore, is the same as for the ECB: given that the design is so bad, how might it work in practice? Today, budget deficits in many euro economies (including the three biggest) stand at more than 2% of GDP (see table 3). If demand in Europe grows more slowly in 1999 than the forecasters expect, those deficits may rise. (In some cases they will tend to rise regardless, as assorted post-Maastricht fudges are unwound.) Governments may soon be faced with the stability-pact requirement to raise taxes and/or cut public spending-even as their economies slide toward recession. Again, therefore, the hope must be that the rules will be bent, or scrapped. If this does not happen, and one or more countries encounter a downturn that the ECB cannot remedy by means of system-wide monetary policy, there are only two alternatives. 
One is that the countries concerned endure a deeper and longer recession than they are used to, or is necessary. This plainly runs the risk of calling forth mounting protests against EMU itself The other is that the fiscal powers available to the centre-the money gathered and spent by Brusselsmust be greatly enlarged. This would allow automatic fiscal stabilisers to work within Europe as they do within the United States of America. Many in Europe would regard this second alternative as desirable in any case, which (if the stability pact survives) makes it the more probable outcome. In any event, this seems likely to be the issue on which Europe's political future turns. 
Ever closer union 
Judged strictly as an economic venture, EMU will be a success if, over the coming years, the participating countries benefit from closer integration (measured by growing trade and investment in the euro area), satisfactory growth, declining unemployment and low inflation. If the single-currency project had been better designed, the chances of achieving this would have been good. Closer economic integration seems assured in any case. A plan that created a properly directed, properly accountable central bank and provided for adequate freedom in national fiscal policy would have done as much as macroeconomic policy can do to take care of the rest. To be sure, that would still have left governments to carry a heavy burden of supply-side reform-without which Europe cannot expect to cut its unemployment to the levels seen in America. Still, the outlook would have been promising. 
As it is, the chances of success are no better than fair. The central bank will have to rise above its flawed design-winning the popular regard it will one day need both by explaining what it is up to, and by balancing the short-term demands of low inflation, on the one hand, and growth in output and employment, on the other, more intelligently than its statutes require. And governments will have to find a way to make fiscal policy respond far more flexibly to economic circumstances than the Maastricht rules allow. 
Ideally this will be done by changing the rules-perhaps to require that budgets are balanced over the course of the economic cycle, but leaving them free to run further into deficit at times of slowing demand than the 3% of GDP allowed by the stability pact. Needless to say, in this case too, efforts to liberalise Europe's markets for goods, services and labour far more determined than governments have made so far will also be required. 
If EMU can overcome the flaws of its design and prove an economic success after all, Europe's governments (and, preferably, their citizens as well) will be able to weigh the coming political choices on their merits. If it fails in economic terms, those political choices may be severely constrainedand, as a result, far more divisive. Closer political integration built on the solid foundation of an EMU that worked would be one thing. The same course adopted in distress to save EMU from failure, or even outright collapse, would be an entirely different, and much more dangerous, enterprise.  1999 PERHAPS the biggest omission in the Maastricht treaty was the failure to clarify the status of the ""outs""-the countries that decline to take part. (Britain, Denmark and Sweden have chosen to stay out; Greece would love to join but is nowhere near satisfying the Maastricht criteria for membership.) This was not an oversight but a deliberate gap, much in accord with the way Europe's architects have tended to proceed. 
The EU'S members are pledged to move towards ""ever closer union"". Implicitly, the idea is that they will approach this goal (as yet undefined) at about the same speed-so the four countries not taking part in Emu at the outset are expected to join as soon as they can. To have designed a durable relationship between the ins and outs might have encouraged further delay. 
It often happens in European politics that if you do not want a contingency to arise, you ignore it, hoping it goes away. Sometimes it does-and this time-honoured approach may also work in the case of EMU'S outs. If monetary union is a success, the qualifying outsiders will warm to the idea. But the collapse of the ERM in 1992-93 showed that the head-in-the-sand method is not infallible. If EMU works badly, outsiders such as Britain are likely to become even more reluctant. 
There is also the question of EU enlargement. Prospective new members in Eastern Europe may not be ready, or may not choose, to join EMu at the beginning. Indeed, they would be wise to be cautious. Their economies are still struggling with the legacy of socialism. For many years yet they are likely to remain structurally different from their western neighbours, leaving them more exposed to the danger of asymmetric economic shocks. This only adds to the case for lasting arrangements allowing Eu countries to opt out of EMU indefinitely. 
The main economic problem posed by a permanent division of the EU into EMU and non-EMu countries is that the outs will be seen by the others as cheats. It is easy to imagine circumstances in which the euro will strengthen against other European currencies, putting euro countries at a competitive disadvantage in trade. If this happens (as well it might) at a time of slowing growth in the euro zone and briskly expanding output elsewhere in the EU, the euro-zone governments will be obliged to object. 
In due course, therefore, some form of monetary co-operation"" will probably be required of the outs, if only as a mark of good faith. One possibility would be a revived ERM, albeit a looser arrangement than the one that collapsed. (For instance, governments might promise to limit variations in their real, as opposed to nominal, exchange rates: this would preserve a measure of monetary discretion while ensuring that governments did not use it to pursue a policy of competitive devaluation.) Failing some such accord, the discussion may move to other ways of correcting the ""unfair"" advantage of the noneuro countries' depreciated currenciesand that is a discussion that could endanger the EU itself 
A permanent union of ins and outs would also raise a host of day-to-day political difficulties. The outs' great fearand what eventually may force them into EMU-is that the centre of decision-making for the EU as a whole will move to the committee of euro-zone finance ministers. This seems certain to happen if EMU runs into trouble, and the euro-zone countries adopt remedies such as collective fiscal policy and/or increased harmonisation of taxes and economic regulations. Even if all goes well, though, a diminution of the outs' political sway seems likely. The ins will surely want to punish the outs, with or without a show of regret. How better to encourage the laggards to change their minds?  1999 Europe's single currency is here, and out goes the ecu. The euro will operate in tandem with local currencies in ii EU countries (four don't want to know), and the new European Central Bank will begin to flex its muscles-but national central banks will still play their parts. Germany takes on the rotating presidencies of not only the European Council and the Western European Union but also the Group of Seven, and New Zealand takes the chair of the Asia-Pacific Economic Co-operation (APEC) forum.

Compiled with help from Future Events News Service, London. http://www.hubcom.com/fens Tel: +44(o)181 672 3191  1999 THE accused has a seemingly simple choice: to fight it out, or to accept his punishment. But is anything in the world of Bill Clinton, the only elected president in America's history to have been impeached by the House of Representatives, truly straightforward? The president's advisers study every nuance of the opinion polls; his lawyers, like grandmasters with a chess board, plot the consequences of this admission or that; fellow Democrats cringe at his sexual shenanigans, but bask in the glow of his impeachment-defying popularity. Meanwhile, the country prays for an end to the saga. 
At some point the Senate will oblige. Just when is still an open question. The momentum that led to the president's impeachment on December 19th remains remorseless. When the new House meets on January 6th, it must first confirm in office Henry Hyde and the 12 other Republican members chosen to manage Mr Clinton's trial before the Senate. When these worthies present themselves and the articles of impeachment to the Senate, the Senate must meet at 1 pm the next day to consider them. Assume that no witnesses are called, and in theory Bill Clinton's (and the country's) ordeal will be over in a matter of days. 
Maybe so. This week the Republican leader of the Senate, Trent Lott, siad he and Tom Daschle, the Democrats' leader, were agreed that there is no need to hear witnesses. Mr Lott's argument is that ""the record is there to be reviewed, read, presented"" in any way the House prosecutors choose, ""and I think that would be sufficient."" Follow Mr Lott's schedule, and the articles of impeachment will be read in the Senate on January 7th; the trial will begin the following Monday, January ith, and last ""a week or two"". 
Will practice be quite so neat? Perhaps not. After all, most of the House Republicans are gung-ho to see the president squirm; their managers are said to be preparing themselves in the ""expectation"" that witnesses will be called; and in the end many senators may not want to snub the House quite so obviously. 
Moreover, if Mr Clinton chooses to fight, Mr Lott's schedule looks otherworldly. True, the president's team seem to have dropped the idea of a time-consuming challenge against the legality of the incoming House being bound by the decisions of its predecessor. But to accept the trial and plead innocence could likewise exhaust the calendar and the nation's patience: the president could reasonably ask the Senate to grant him time to prepare his defence, and this defence-and Henry Hyde's prosecution-would surely involve the calling of witnesses. 
But what if Mr Clinton does not fight? The president may have struck a defiant tone immediately after his impeachment, but he also talked of ""a reasonable, bipartisan, and proportionate response"" that could be ""embraced in the Senate"" as a ""constitutional and fair means of resolving this matter in a prompt manner"". In other words, the president, having expressed contrition ad nauseam, is willing to accept the public censure of Congress, a solution advocated in various forms over the months by senior members of both parties. 
The attractions of censure are many. For Democrats, it provides an escape from the embarrassment of a trial. For Republicans, given the arithmetic of the Senate, it offers a measure of retribution that a trial would in the end deny (a guilty verdict would need the approval of 67 of the loo senators, an unlikely outcome given that the Senate has 55 Republicans and 45 Democrats). 
But censure on whose terms? Robert Byrd, the Senate's senior Democrat and its leading historian, is adamant that-censure or no censure-a trial must be started. It is commonly agreed that it could be ended at any point on a vote by 51 senators, and the Senate could then vote to censure. Indeed, Daniel Patrick Moynihan, the senior Democratic senator from New York, suggests a subtle refinement: let the continuation of the trial be kept in reserve, ready to be invoked if Mr Clinton suddenly decides not to play ball on censure-and let Mr Clinton give censure the force of law, by signing a censure bill sent to him by both House and Senate. Mitch McConnell, a Republican from Kentucky, believes the Senate has a duty to carry a trial to its end and only then, assuming neither article of impeachment garners the support of 67 senators, do ""you sit down and you negotiate the censure alternative."" 
All of which is probably more easily said than achieved. The Republicans and a great many Democrats are adamant that the president must admit that he committed perjury, lying under oath to a grandjury. The president is so far unwilling to admit anything of the sort, mostly for fear of legal consequences (the talk persists of indictments awaiting both him and the First I adv once he has left the White House). From the president's perspective, censure must surely be accompanied by a binding forgiveness, however reluctantly given. 
Is such a bargain impossible? For some idealists, perhaps. But Mr Clinton may well assume that Congress has at least as many pragmatists and that they, like him, can read opinion polls that show his ratings rising as the Republican Party's fall. Meanwhile, it does no harm to gently remind voters and Congress alike that his state-ofthe-union message is due on January 19th; and that, despite Kenneth Starr and the impeachment votes in the House, the state is still looking pretty good.  1999 THE accused has a seemingly simple choice: to fight it out, or to accept his punishment.

Meanwhile, it does no harm to gently remind voters and Congress alike that his state-ofthe-union message is due on January 19th; and that, despite Kenneth Starr and the impeachment votes in the House, the state is still looking pretty good.  1999 Why learning to fight by computer may not be quite good enough 
IN A sealed room in sprawling Camp Pendleton, a Marine Corps base in California, a young corporal is mastering the use of the most formidable weapon in his arsenal: his brain. A CD-RoM-based simulator takes him through a variety of crises in which he must make split-second decisions and issue instant orders to cope with anything from a sudden burst of enemy gunfire to the approach of a band of thirsty refugees or a roving CNN crew. 
The Camp Pendleton programme is one example of how America is changing the way it trains its armed forces, so that they can handle a post-cold-war world in which charging tank divisions are less common than the chaos of ""low-intensity conflicts"", the jargon for peace-making and peace-enforcement operations. In this new world, the decisions taken by a lg-year-old crouching behind a bush with his finger on the trigger of an M-16 rifle or a laser-aimed missile can have enormous consequences for the foreign policy of the West. 
The Marine Corps, smaller in size and less bureaucratic than its larger cousins of the army, the navy and the air force, is help ing to shape these new training techniques. The 12-day, still-experimental course, of which the CD-ROM simulator is one component, aims to give the young leaders of 12-man sections the decision-making skills and killing authority previously reserved for company or even battalion commanders. Some of the things the marines learn, such as how to stay under cover, are standard military fare. Others, including the counselling skills taught by psychologists, seem to come straight from the world of New Age management gurus; but the young section leaders seem to relish it. 
One aim of the new training system is to enable American soldiers of the 21st century to handle the ""three-block war"". The phrase describes an operation in which they would simultaneously be distributing food and medicine to frantic civilians in one part of a city, quelling rioters and maintaining order in another, and fighting guerrillas in a third. 
Americans have already seen variations of the three-block war in Haiti, Somalia and Bosnia. Memories of the ill-fated rescue operation in Somalia in 1993 still haunt the military planners, especially the ""Ranger ambush"" in which a combined force of Rangers and Delta Force commandos was trapped by Somali gunmen for 18 hours; 18 men were killed and 73 wounded. Although the marines were not involved in that debacle, it is with an eye on the lessons of Somalia that the corps is now putting new emphasis on urban-warfare tactics and the need for first-class leadership of small units. 
The new training goes hand-in-hand with the use of new military instruments, such as the ""non-lethal munitions"" that will help to give American troops a wider range of options when dealing with an adversary than just trying to kill him. At one demonstration held for Camp Pendleton's senior officers, the arsenal of weapons on show included bean-bag projectiles fired from shotguns and grenade-launchers, blinding pepper sprayed from devices the size of fire-extinguishers, ultra-powerful flashlights that can find and dazzle potential snipers, and grenades which explode into a mess of adhesive foam that can block a doorway or goo up a suspected guerrilla. 
But what Americans peering into the future of warfare call the Revolution in Military Affairs, the RMA, also employs sterner weapons than these. In future wars of the Bosnia sort, for instance, small numbers of highly trained men with sophisticated weapons under their control will be ableit is hoped-to defeat much bigger armies of the conventional sort with little or no loss to themselves. Hidden on a hillside miles from the enemy, their fingers on precision-aiming devices, and helped by eyein-the-sky satellites and reconnaissance aircraft, they will be able to steer long-range missiles on to the enemy's tanks or guns; and the enemy will not be able to fire back, because he cannot see them and, even if he could, they are probably out of range. 
In such a fight, the weapons used by the warriors of the RMA will by no means be confined to bean-bags and gluey foam. A look at the equipment on display in Camp Pendleton makes the point. Most of them have two barrels and two triggers: one for firing non-lethal projectiles, the other for delivering the old-fashioned, deadly kind. A switch of the trigger and the kinder, gentler marines of the 21st century instantly become lethal. The advocates of the xn,tR are determined to make sure that America and its allies remain ahead of the rest of the world not only in the military technology they possess but also in the skills needed to use these weapons. 
And what happens when an adversary manages to manufacture, buy or steal a collection of similar weapons, as he doubtless will? Why, by then, say the confident optimists of the RA, America and its trusted allies will be deploying even newer devices that can be fired with equal accuracy from still farther away. 
Some American officers, especially older ones, have their misgivings. They say that a system of war built upon a wish to destroy the enemy without yourself suffering any significant number of casualties is inherently dangerous. Remember that 1993 disaster in Somalia. New kinds of weapons, instructed by satellites and computers, may be able to win future firefights of this sort more swiftly and at less cost to your own men; but the men will still need to be there, to occupy some vital hilltop or essential building, and they will have to be prepared to take the consequences. 
In the end, your soldiers must face the risk of being wounded or killed. Clever and brave guerrillas, fighting in places where they are hard to detect-forests or mountains or city side-streets-have to be pursued by soldiers who are not only expertly trained for such warfare but are also willing to engage the enemy at close quarters. Any adversary, when defeated, leaves behind a region which has to be occupied by your own side, to make sure he does not start the war all over again; and your occupying force is bound to suffer casualties. 
An army that believes it can avoid standing in harm's way is, say the sceptics, liable to prove perilously fragile. The coming century is going to provide plenty of crises in which deadly force, working in both directions, cannot be avoided.  1999 NATURE abhors a vacuum. So do American entrepreneurs. Consider a firm called Autopsy/Post Services (1-800-AUTOPSY), founded in 1988 by Vidal Herrera. The frequency with which autopsies are performed in America has been falling steadily for over three decades, and Mr Herrera has made his mark by leaping in to fill the void. 
Mr Herrera charges $2,000 for a complete autopsy, more if the body has been exhumed or if extra tests are ordered. Many of his customers suspect foul play or malpractice. Others have medical questions that a hospital or insurance company would not pay to have answered. Mr Herrera expects to perform roughly 800 autopsies this year; he has turned away thousands of others across the United States, and in other countries, because he could not handle them from his Los Angeles base. That problem will soon be over; in January, Autopsy/Post Services will begin selling franchises in 72 American cities and 16 countries. 
The success of 1-800-AuTOPSY aside, public-health experts are alarmed by the falling number of conventional autopsies. In 196o, roughly one in two deaths in Chicago area hospitals was followed up with an autopsy; that rate is now about one in ten. Federal data collected since 1972 show the same trend. Indeed, experts note that autopsy rates are falling around the world. 
Autopsies can be used to determine the effectiveness of surgical procedures and drug treatments. They provide accurate vital statistics, teach medical students, uncover new diseases and spot old ones that may be spreading. All the while, they sniff out incompetent medical care and the odd murder that might have passed for a slip in the bathtub. George Lundberg, editor of the Journal of the American Medical Association (AMA), points out that medical conditions such as toxic shock syndrome and congenital heart disease (as well as many others) were discovered by autopsy. Toxic shock has now been pretty much stamped out; congenital heart disease can be treated successfully with surgery. 
An autopsy is perhaps the onlyway for the dead to speak to the living. Why are Americans listening less? One reason is cost. An autopsy can run up a bill from several hundred dollars to several thousand, depending on the methodology. In the days before the health-care system began slimming down, most insurance policies covered the procedure. If not, hospitals politely picked up the tab. No longer. As Hmos, insurance companies and hospitals struggle to distribute scarce resources, they tend to favour the living over the dead. (State and local governments have the right to demand an autopsy in any case where foul play is suspected or the cause of death is unknown.) 
Autopsy, like organ donation, is a difficult subject to broach with grieving families (though the public good associated with both can help the grieving process The attending physician is the logical person to suggest a post-mortem exam; yet all too often a doctor's primary concern is covering his own gluteus maximus. An autopsy may prove a doctor wrong, or even negligent. 
Doctors with better intentions may simply believe that more sophisticated laboratory tests and imaging technology have made the autopsy redundant. Alas, they have not. A study by researchers at Louisiana State University Medical Centre used autopsies to determine that doctors missed 44% of cancerous tumours while patients were alive. Another study at the University of Pittsburgh found a 45% discordance between what clinical doctors diagnosed as the cause of death and what an autopsy later showed it to be. 
In 1988, the JAMA ran an issue round the theme: ""Declaring war on the non-autopsy"". So far, it has been more of a slow retreat. Last month, the Journal took up the torch once again. An editorial proposed a minimum autopsy rate as a condition for hospital accreditation and/or Medicare reimbursement. Meanwhile Mr Herrera, looking ahead to a bulge of dying babyboomers, foresees endless opportunities.  1999 ON AUGUST 15th, Timothy Boomer fell out of his canoe. Naturally, he cursed, using ""loudly and repeatedly . . . a most offensive vulgarity"" together with ""various derivatives"". He was in the middle of nowhere at the time, in a wilderness area of the Rifle River near the Jack Pine Trail in Michigan. Imagine his surprise, therefore, when a deputy sheriff from Arenac County promptly issued him with a ticket for swearing. 
Mr Boomer had failed to note that besides the sheriff, Kenneth Socia, and his buddies sitting on the bank, there were also a woman and two children enjoying the rustic scene within earshot of his oaths. He had therefore infringed a Michigan obscene-speech law, more than a century old, which reads: 
Sec. 337: Indecent, etc, language in presence of women-Any person who shall use any indecent, immoral, obscene, vulgar or insulting language in the presence or hearing of any woman or child shall be guilty of a misdemeanour. 
And being guilty of a misdemeanour, he faces a 90-day jail term or a $100 fine if convicted. Mr Boomer argued for dismissal of the charges, but failed, and now he is about to stand trial. 
The American Civil Liberties Union has leapt in to support him. It argues that cursing is a form of free speech, and that what was unacceptable to delicate 19thcentury ears is now commonplace; so commonplace that, Mr Boomer argues, the four women canoeing with him didn't turn a hair. The prosecutors are less forgiving. Cursing, they say, does not express an idea or a thought. What? Not even the thought that Hell! This water's cold!? Or Damn! The girls are watching!?  1999 THE scholar warms almost instantly to his theme: ""We have been so stable, apart from the Civil War, that we think it natural. Britain and the us are the only countries since 18oo not to have had their form of government changed by violence. You take stability as a given, when in fact it's a rarity."" In other words, let the Senate be wary when it sets about the trial of Bill Clinton. 
It is a good point, seldom heard in the impeachment blather that has filled America's airwaves for the past year. But the scholar is Daniel Patrick Moynihan, the senior Democratic senator for New York, and perhaps his voice, his manner, his lateral leaps of creative reasoning are a shade too eccentric to make him a talk-show regular. True, he has made more than two dozen appearances on NBC's ""Meet the Press""-but over 31 years. Most recently, just after Christmas, he managed to quote off-the-cuff not just from Shakespeare's ""Troilus and Cressida"" (""Lechery, lechery; still, wars and lechery: nothing else holds fashion"") but also from Dr Johnson. These are not the sound-bites of normal television. 
But Mr Moynihan is not a normal politician. Michael Barone, one of America's finest political pundits, describes him as ""the nation's best thinker among politicians since Lincoln and its best politician among thinkers since Jefferson."" Of the thinking, there is no doubt. Most senators stuff their offices with photos of themselves meeting other important people. This senator stuffs his with books-not just his own (18 at the latest count) but also the Encyclopaedia Judaica, the International Encyclopaedia of the Social Sciences, bound volumes of the Public Interest, back issues of Political Science Quarterly, and so on. On the mantlepiece is a lunch invitation from the Maharajah of Jodhpur(Mr Moynihan is, after all, a former ambassador to India, as well as to the UN). In short, the office is a don's delight, and Mr Moynihan-large sherry glass in hand, jaunty bow-tie not quite matching the breast-pocket handkerchief-suits it perfectly. 
But what of the politics? In the age of the professional politician, can the Barone superlative really fit a man whose working life has been spent flitting back and forth between academia (Tufts, Harvard, Oxford, the London School of Economics) and public service (posts under Presidents Kennedy,Johnson, Nixon and Ford)? Is Mr Moynihan not just a clever, witty Jack-of-alltrades, with all that the cliche implies? 
Actually, no. One simple reason is that the best politicians are those who get re-elected, and Mr Moynihan, even though he ""hates"" raising campaign money and presses to reform the system, is now in his fourth term in the Senate. They are also those who get things done, which in Mr Moynihan's case means not just some solid environmental and social legislation but also what is now known as ""Ice-Tea"", the 1991 Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act, which-not by coincidence-has channelled billions of dollars of public spending to New York's road and rail systems. 
But the best justification for the Barone superlative is that, despite appearances, there is an unbroken thread running through the Moynihan career: an interest in governance. The senator is a policy wonk with the political skills, regularly applied across party lines, to put ideas into practice. Witness his far-sighted study of 1965, ""The Negro Family"", in which he emphasised the connection between fatherless families and increased welfare rolls. Although it was largely ignored at the time, that study led to the 1988 Welfare Reform Act, which for the first time recognised a father's duty to support his children (and a mother's responsibility to find a job). 
What, then, does he think of the 1996 ""welfare-to-work"" reforms, which limit federal handouts to a lifetime total of five years? Not a lot, is the short answer: no one knows what will happen when people fall off the ""five-year cliff"". Perhaps his fears of social distress-he points out that 97% of births to teenage mothers in Washington, Dc, are out of wedlock-will prove groundless. But perhaps not. After all, the reason the eccentric Mr Moynihan is so respected is that he has so often been right. He was, for example, the first to mock CIA assessments of the strength of the Soviet Union, arguing that it was bound to disintegrate under the pressure of its ethnic differences. He was possibly the first to apply epidemiological theory to drugs policy (noting that their illegality promotes crime, he coined the phrase ""iatrogenic government"", comparing government to a doctor whose intrusion only makes a patient worse). And he was an early critic of the Clintons' abortive 1993 effort to reform health care, arguing that with five out of six Americans covered by health insurance, and with free or subsidised care provided for the poor and elderly, the true crisis was not in the health system but the welfare system. 
So is he right in his warnings about impeachment? Is it true, as he told ""Meet the Press"", that ""we could so easily mutate into a president of the month"", with a congressional majority ""routinely removing presidents"" and House speakers therefore becoming presidents? He admits the prospect is hard to imagine, but it is still wise to assure institutional stability. The voice rises in volume and, with an exaggerated roll of the ""r"", the senator points out that the founding fathers talked of ""treason"" as a reason to remove a president from office, not the sins of Mr Clinton. 
But it is getting late; the tutorial must end; the second tumbler of sherry must be regretfully declined. Outside, Pennsylvania Avenue-beautified at the senator's initiative-is almost deserted. What a pity, thinks the student, that the professor, risen from a fatherless childhood in New York's Hell's Kitchen to become a seemingly permanent star of the Senate, should be intent on retiring in 2000. Mr Moynihan roars with laughter: ""Good God, man. It's my teeth, my lower back, and it was understood with my wife at the last election that I wouldn't stand again."" But what a pity, all the same.  1999 Forty years of revolutionary fervour have left Cuba's economy in ruins and its future uncertain. But Fidel Castro remains unchallenged 
ON JANUARY 1st, Cubans celebrated not only the beginning of 1999, but the 40th anniversary of Fidel Castro's revolution. There does not seem much to celebrate. The economy is in a mess. Corruption is rife. Prostitution is rampant. Despite police or neighbourhood watchdogs on every street corner, crime is rising. The country's infrastructure is crumbling. The grand promises of the past 40 years are in tatters. In some ways, Cuba seems worse off in 1999 than it was in 1959. And yet, curiously, the chief author of these misfortunes, Mr Castro himself, still retains a place in the heart of most Cubans. 
Mr Castro claims he has no power, only great authority. This is bogus. Outspoken critics end up in jail or exile. And yet Fidelas he is almost universally known-is not loathed as are most other dictators. There are no statues to him, no buildings named after him, no Saddam-style posters. Instead, Fidel's monuments are six-hour speeches and television and radio coverage of his every public word, thought and deed. Most Cubans are inured to this constant stream of bombast, tolerating it with a shrug. Many feel affection for the man who has stood up for so long to the United States. In the countryside, he is even loved by some, especially by older Cubans, despite their country's impoverishment, which can at least be partly blamed on the Yanqui blockade. 
Most people know that Fidel's original socialist dream has long been dead, and they want changes. But they are also wary of what full-blooded western capitalism might bring. They do not want to lose the ""gains of the revolution""-a welfare state, free education and health care. These are real achievements for such a relatively poor country, although the country's dismal economy has now crippled all three. Many would like to see Fidel retire gracefully. Few are keen on a violent overthrow. 
Intelligent, capable, capricious, Mr Castro retains almost total control over every aspect of government-which is the biggest reason why the country is in such a mess. In the words of one restaurant owner: ""As soon as something begins to work, it is halted. As soon as anything becomes profitable, it is stopped."" 
After a series of crackdowns on private sector activity, Cubans have become wary and secretive. Most do not keep bank accounts (because the government would then know how much money they have). The black economy is huge, and more efficient than the state sector. But it corrodes certain values and is undermining the public sector itself. Doctors steal drugs from hospitals to sell for dollars. State stores and markets are surrounded by people selling pilfered goods. 
The sugar harvest in 1998, beset by a series of weather disasters, was 3.zm tonnes: the smallest crop in 50 years. Hit by low prices for sugar and nickel, Cuba's main products, the country's overall exports fell by ii% while imports grew by 6%. Its trade deficit was over $2 billion in 1997. Once the final figures are calculated for 1998, the total trade deficit is likely to be far worse. 
When Mr Castro took power, he based development on the ""three pillars of the Cuban revolution"": health, education and industrialisation. The Cuban economy now rests on just two pillars: tourism-Cuba's biggest hard-currency earner-and Miami. Money sent by Cuban exiles to relations in Cuba is now estimated to bring the island over $1 billion a year in cash alone, more than Cuba earns from sugar exports. 
As the 40th-anniversary speeches drone on, two questions will be on most Cubans' minds: how will the reign of Fidel come to an end, and what will happen when he goes? Of course, most people want a peaceful change of power. This is most likely if Mr Castro hands it over willingly. The ""Pinochet scenario"" is often discussed sotto voce, but it is unlikely to happen largely because Mr Castro is not the kind of man to stand aside. Moreover, General Pinochet's detention in Britain shows that it may no longer be safe to be a former dictator, at least a travelling one. 
It is more likely that Mr Castro, now aged 72, will die in harness, ranting and speechifying to his last breath. Unfortunately for Cuba's future, he is in good health, despite rumours to the contrary. If he does die in office, with no effort at a transition to democratic rule, Cubans could face the violence and political chaos they fear the most. The designated heir is General Raul Castro, Fidel's brother and head of the armed forces. But he is not popular, and is only five years younger than Fidel. Few think he would be able to hold on to power for long. A small group of technocrats who have occasionally succeeded in persuading a reluctant Mr Castro to loosen economic controls might gain power and then ease Cuba towards democracy. But the chances ofthis happening do not look high. With Fidel's passing, such technocrats are likely to lose all authority. 
However Mr Castro departs, his successors will immediately face not only pentup demands at home, but also demands for the return of property seized by the Castro government, or for compensation. Ownership of oil refineries, hotels, farmland, nickel mines-all currently run by foreign investors-is claimed by American citizens or Cuban exiles. Many houses, now occupied by several families, and many buildings that have been turned into schools or hospitals, once belonged to people who are now living in Miami. For this reason alone, the return of the exiles from Miami is dreaded by many Cubans. Their anxiety has been ruthlessly exploited by the regime, but it is real nonetheless. 
Forty years of being dominated by one loquacious, erratic man has left Cubans with a ruined economy, disintegrating public services and an uncertain future. With no plausible political heirs in sight, no credible opposition and an exile community itching not only for return, but revenge, Cubans are right to fear chaos or even civil war after Mr Castro goes. Not much of a legacy, nor much to celebrate.  1999 IT WAS not supposed to be like this. When Fernando Henrique Cardoso persuaded his country's Congress to overturn a constitutional ban on incumbents seeking reelection, he seemed to have the credentials to enter history not just as the man who had vanquished his country's chronic inflation, but as a great modernising leader of a kind Brazil had not seen for three decades. 
He may yet achieve such stature But, as he starts his second term on January 1st, Brazil's prospects are gloomy, and fraught with risk. Mr Cardoso had once hoped that his second term would be devoted to social and political reform-the president is, after all, a social democrat in an unequal and unjust country. Instead, Mr Cardoso must grapple with the pressing unfinished business of his first term: shoring up the country's precarious economic and financial stability. 
That involves swiftly completing the task of getting Congress to approve a huge fiscal squeeze, involving tax increases and spending cuts amounting to 28 billion reais ($23.5 billion) and aimed at cutting the fiscal deficit from 8% of GDP in 1998 to around 4.7% in 1999. That is the main condition of the $41.5 billion rescue package which the IMF agreed to in November, and which the government hopes will restore confidence in Brazil's economic policies. 
Success would mean that in a year's time Brazil might emerge from recession with its economy fundamentally strengthened. Failure would mean not just a forced devaluation of Brazil's currency, but would also damage Mr Cardoso's credibility, perhaps irreparably. Since August, his government has spent over $30 billion in reserves defending the real, and its defence was the platform on which he won the presidential election in October. But even if Mr Cardoso succeeds in making fiscal austerity stick, Brazil is clearly facing a hard year in 1999. 
As expected, Mr Cardoso's team has not radically changed. Of 31 ministers and secretaries, 23 served in the first administration. The dozen front-line ministers to keep their jobs include Pedro Malan, the finance minister and architect of the IMF agreement, whose position has grown steadily stronger as the economy has weakened. 
A sign of this is Mr Cardoso's choice of Celso Lafer to head a new Ministry of Development, which will handle industrial policy. The creation of this ministry is intended to make fiscal austerity more politically palatable. It is seen as a potential source of alternative policies by those, such as FIESP, the Sao Paulo industrialists' federation, who dislike Mr Malan's orthodoxies and would prefer devaluation, lower interest rates and higher tariffs. Yet Mr Lafer is unlikely to oblige them. Though once a director of a family metal-bashing firm, and the cousin of FIESP'S energetic new chairman, Mr Lafer is an academic whose last job was as Brazil's ambassador to the World Trade Organisation. He lacks the political clout, and probably the inclination, to challenge Mr Malan. 
Mr Cardoso has left the main social ministries in the hands of his own Social Democratic Party. Paulo Renato de Souza stays as education minister, a job he has held for four years-a rare and effective example of continuity in a crucial area that is often poorly administered in Latin America. Like Jose Serra, the health minister, his task is now to make a smaller budget go further. A dozen other ministers owe theirjobs to Mr Cardoso's need to satisfy his allies in his four-party, centre-right coalition. The president has made it plain that to keep their jobs they have to deliver votes in Congress for the austerity measures. 
Marshalling its broad but unreliable majority in Congress remains the government's biggest challenge. According to David Fleischer,a political scientist at the University of Brasilia, the big winner in the new team (apart from Mr Malan) is Clovis Carvalho, the presidents chief of staff. A plan to set up a new Ministry of Government, which would have handled political liaison and encroached on Mr Carvalho's turf, has come to nothing. 
But Mr Carvalho is widely disliked in Congress. Already, the government's failings in this area have cost it dearly. Poor liaison with Congress was the main reason for two setbacks in the implementation of the fiscal package. The first was the defeat last month of a law increasing civil servants' pension contributions, an unpopular but essential measure. The second was the government's delay in presenting a bill to extend and increase a tax on bank cheques. These setbacks could cost the government up to to billion reais in 1999, and they have already set off a new round of jitters in the financial markets. 
All is not yet lost. On December 3oth, the government announced emergency tax rises and spending cuts aimed at raising 6.7 billion reais. The new Congress elected in October, which starts work in February, may be more tractable. Mr Fleischer points out that about 50 of the more notorious backsliders in the ruling coalition will not be returning. In due course, the government will try again to get approval for higher pension contributions. 
But time is short. At the end of February, the In.iF will make its first check on Brazil's progress. The financial markets will make their own, and probably more rigorous, judgment. By then, the government must take credible steps to make austerity stick. Otherwise, Mr Cardoso risks going into history as the leader who, by failing to give firm fiscal underpinning to the real, squandered Brazil's best development opportunity in more than a generation.  1999 Facing a strengthened opposition, India's ruling party confronts progress 
MOTHER TERESA was no saint but a Christian zealot who terrorised those who refused to convert. Amartya Sen was slightly more deserving of his Nobel prize (for economics), but the mass literacy he champions would seduce Hindus away from their religion. These startling views come from Ashok Singhal, president of the Vishwa Hindu Parishad (World Hindu Council). That Christians make up a tiny (2.3%) share of India's population makes the remarks even more bizarre. But they count for something. At virtually the same time Mr Singhal was sounding off, Hindu militants were attacking Christians and their churches in the western state of Gujarat. Mr Singhal's group is an influential associate of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS), which leads a family of Hindunationalist groups to which the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), India's ruling party, also belongs. 
The sJP seems embarrassed. It governs Gujarat and the attacks are continuing. On December 3oth mobs set fire to two Roman Catholic prayer halls. Though far from communal violence at its worst, the attacks undermine the party's boast that minorities are secure where it rules and feed the claim of a resurgent opposition that the sJP is the party of intolerance. The sJP-led government has sent officials to Gujarat to investigate. 
All great political parties have wings and fringes, sJs-men point out. Look at New and Old Labour in Britain and America's Republican Party, which encompasses flat-taxers and fundamentalists, internationalists and isolationists. But there is a difference. Most successful parties suborn ideology to the achievement of power. The BJP, on the other hand, is the creation of an ideological brotherhood that regards politics as the handmaiden of culture and religion. It is as if the Republican Party were the political wing of a less benign version of the Christian Coalition. That deformity is hobbling India's government. 
So far, mostly in economic policy. Following the BJP's humiliation in three state elections in November, it briefly looked as if the party's pragmatists would tame the ideologues of the RSS. The prime minister, Atal Behari Vajpayee, shuffled his cabinet and appointed allies not beloved ofthe Rss. The winter session of Parliament was supposed to show that the BJP could govern in spite of tensions within the Rss and among the 18 parties in the ruling coalition. 
It proved no such thing. The government had wanted to pass some 40 bills; in the event just 17 were introduced to the lower house of Parliament and just 14 were passed. Among the casualties were two much-touted economic reform bills, one to open insurance to competition and foreign investment, the other to curb piracy of patented products. Both measures attracted opposition, some of it from trade unionists, who regard competition as a threat to jobs, some of it from left-wing parties allergic to liberalisation. But the opposition that mattered most came from the BjP's own swadeshi (buy Indian) lobby, which takes its cue from the Rss rather than from Mr Vajpayee. Both bills stalled. Though the government now talks of starting the next session of Parliament early to get them passed, it remains to be seen whether the swadeshi lobby will allow this. 
The BJP has had more luck keeping the blandishments of Mr Singhal and people like him from becoming national policy. The large number of parties in the coalition, in most respects a hindrance to good government, have supplied Mr Vajpayee with an excuse. The coalition's governing manifesto drops significant portions of the Hindu-nationalist wish-list, such as the call to end the autonomy granted under the constitution to Jammu & Kashmir, India's only Muslim-majority state. Proximity to power has mellowed even the home minister, LK. Advani, the ideologues' most powerful friend in government. On December 6th, six years after the Babri mosque in Ayodhya was demolished by Hindu militants, he called its destruction ""singularly unfortunate"". His regret is an affront to the RSS'S saffron brigades, whose dearest wish is to build a temple on what they believe to be the birthplace of the god Ram. 
To Christians such sentiments ring hollow. Yet the BJP must at least pretend to disavow the ideologues to retain power. It is not that Hindus reject Hindutva, the notion that India is defined by its Hindu way of life. According to a recent poll in India Today, most Indians support Hindutva nostrums, such as the compulsory singing in schools of ""Vande Mataram"", a patriotic song offensive to some Muslims. But not fervently enough to overlook the BJP's failings in government. Indians fault the BJP for the blundering of the hydraheaded coalition it leads and a rise in the price of onions and other staples. They think the opposition Congress party would provide more stable and competent government. The poll suggested that if an election were called now, Congress would trounce the BJP. 
The BJP cannot recoup by fanning communal tensions. One reason Congress did well in November's state elections was that minorities, especially Muslims, returned to their traditional support of the party after a period of disenchantment. A BJP-inspired outbreak of communal violence would drive many Hindus in the same direction. Most of the party's leaders, though not Rss die-hards, realise that it would confirm the B's inability to govern. 
Achieving such enlightenment on economic reform is harder. There are few votes in promoting the interests of foreign insurers and pharmaceutical firms, the most ob vious beneficiaries of insurance and patent legislation. When the executive committee of the BJP meets in Bangalore on January 2nd and 3rd, Mr Vajpayee will try to persuade his colleagues that such reforms also belong to the compulsions of power. The Hindu-nationalist family is being made to swallow a show of tolerance in Delhi, if not in Gujarat. Can it be forced to swallow progress as well?  1999 YET another government has collapsed in the Himalayan kingdom of Nepal. The latest political crisis arose when the prime minister, Girija Prasad Koirala, resigned after one of his partners pulled out of the ruling coalition. Though Mr Koirala has put together a new coalition and was reappointed to the prime ministership by King Birendra on December 23rd, the new government-the sixth since the last general election in 1994-will not last long either: Mr Koirala hopes to win approval from parliament on January 14th for an election in April. 
Nepal has been struggling to establish a stable form of multi-party government since April 199o, when a pro-democracy movement obliged King Birendra to end his almost absolute rule and become a constitutional monarch. Since no single party has been able to count on a majority, all sorts of ideologically incompatible coalitions have been formed. In order to encompass a wide range of parties, they have often been burdened with huge cabinets (one had 48 ministers). 
Mr Koirala's latest coalition includes one of Nepal's two main communist parties, the United Marxist Leninist Party (which is not really much to the left of the prime minister's centrist Nepali Congress Party). The outgoing partner in the previous coalition was the other main communist group which, confusingly, also calls itself the Marxist Leninists. The coalition also includes the Nepal Sadbhavana, a regional party. The prime minister has managed to keep his cabinet to just ni members-one of them, for the first time in eight years, a nominee of the king. 
Since Nepal has seen so much political paralysis, the euphoria that accompanied the end of the king's rule in one of the world's poorest countries has long faded. ""We are just muddling through,"" says Sridhar Khatri, a professor of political science at Tribhuvan University in Katmandu. ""There is no political architecture emerging."" Some blame a Supreme Court ruling that has prevented several prime ministers from dissolving parliament and holding an election. That has obliged politicians to stay in power on the basis of opportunistic agreements. 
Will the new poll produce a clear winner? Opinion differs. Some people argue that the Nepali Congress Party has a good chance ofwinning a majority because it is now more united. Others foresee yet another hung parliament. 
The result may well depend on how Nepal's communists divide their votes among the various parties. A Maoist group could also disrupt the election. It is involved in an increasingly bloody insurgency, which has claimed over 400 lives since it began in February 1996.  1999 SENIOR Khmer Rouge leaders have apologised, for the first time, for the suffering they caused between 1975 and 1979 when some 1.7m people are reckoned to have died during the movement's reign of terror. Speaking to reporters in Phnom Penh, Khieu Samphan, aged 67, the former nominal leader of the Khmers Rouges, was asked if he had regrets about what they had done. He replied, ""Yes, sorry, very sorry."" Sitting alongside him, looking uneasy, was Nuon Chea, aged 71, the movement's chief ideologue, and Brother Number Two to Pol Pot, who died in the jungle in 1998. Silent for most of the 3o-minute press conference, he offered a rather bizarre apology: for the deaths of animals as well as people. ""They all died because we wanted to win the war,"" he said. 
Suggestions that the pair should stand trial before an international tribunal for crimes against humanity were brushed aside. Mr Samphan said the outside world should let Cambodia solve its own problems. ""Let bygones be bygones,"" he said, repeating the dismissivewords used byprevious Khmer Rouge defectors. He did, however, acknowledge the bitterness felt by many Cambodians whose families had been murdered. He had experienced their anger at first hand in 1991 when he narrowly escaped lynching after returning to Phnom Penh from a meeting in Paris to bring a formal end to the civil war. 
This time there was no lynch mob. The casual observer might have been forgiven for thinking the two men were diplomats enjoying vip treatment. They were warmly welcomed by the prime minister, Hun Sen, on December 29th at his residence on the outskirts of the Cambodian capital, and treated to lunch. They have been staying at a luxury hotel, equipped with a swimming pool, tennis courts and golf range. 
Mr Hun Sen indicated that it was unlikely that the pair would have to face trial for crimes against humanity. He said such a trial would be divisive and might mean a return to civil war. His argument has not been well received by many Cambodians. Allowing rank-and-file former Khmers Rouges to make new lives without punishment is mainly accepted. But there is opposition to such tolerance being extended to Pol Pot's henchmen. Many Cambodians say they are not concerned so much about retribution. But they believe a trial might throw light on why the Khmers Rouges sought to bring such misery to the country. 
King Sihanouk, sensing growing public anger over the soft treatment of the pair, has now said that he would not be willing to grant an amnesty to the two men. In part, that is academic. Neither man has yet been charged with anything. For his part, King Sihanouk has said he believes any international court would have the ""perfect right"" to take up the case of genocide in Cambodia. Two years ago, the king, under pressure from the Cambodian government, pardoned leng Sary, who had once been Pol Pofs foreign minister, but had more recently become a useful go-between in arranging defections. In 1979 he had been sentenced to death, in his absence, for genocide. Prince Sihanouk, as he was, briefly held the office of head of state under the Khmers Rouges. He was virtually a prisoner in his palace but may be embarrassed by the connection to the regime. 
Human-rights groups also believe that Mr Samphan and Mr Nuon Chea should be brought to trial. They bear responsibility for many of the Khmers Rouges' misdeeds, and the groups say it is important to break Cambodia's ""culture of impunity"", where killers go free while petty thieves without protection from powerful people are jailed.  1999 China was supposed to be growing more tolerant of dissent. It isn't 
THE authorities dithered for months, then showed their mailed fist. Orga-, nisers of the first, open opposition to Communist rule, the Chinese Democratic Party, which declared itself last summer by attempting to register in 14 provinces and big cities, were rounded up in late November. On December 21st, Xu Wenli, a veteran of the Democracy Wall movement of 1978-79, began a 13-year sentence for ""attempting to overthrow the state"". At least he was allowed a lawyer, through whom he smuggled out a note declaring that his ""so-called open trial was in truth nothing more than a means for political persecution"". 
Qin Yongmin and Wang Youcai were denied legal defence. Mr Qin, another Democracy Wall veteran, was jailed for 12 years and Mr Wang, a student leader at the time of the Tiananmen protests in 1989, got ii years. In case the message of Communist intolerance was still not clear, on December 27th, Zhang Shanguang was sent to prison for ten years for giving Radio Free Asia, financed by America, details of farmers' protests in central Hunan province. 
Western governments have delivered unusually forceful protests. But anger is overlaid with embarrassment. After all, the same Chinese leaders who decided upon the stiff sentences are those whose backs are slapped at international gatherings for their economic sophistication. And much has been made by Bill Clinton's administration of the new policy of engagement rather than confrontation with China over human rights. For a time, success appeared to be at hand. China's two most prominent jailed dissidents were released into American care, Wei Jingsheng in 1997 and Wang Dan in April 1998. A third, Liu Nianchun, was released on medical grounds to America on December 22th. 
Mr Clinton's state visit last June seemed to coincide with a new air of tolerance in China, a thaw warm enough to be termed a ""Beijing spring"". Just last October China signed (but did not ratify) the United Nations covenant on civil and political rights. Now the engagement scorecard looks less impressive: three dissidents released, but four others newly sent to prison. Though China may well see these as future chips (their exile in return for western concessions in other fields), America will find it harder to justify such Faustian bargains. 
Some in western governments hope a rod can be held to China's back with the annual UN review of its human-rights record. In the past China has dissuaded the Geneva panel from passing judgment. Success this time cannot be assured. But China either thinks that a damning at the UN can be avoided as usual, as western criticism gives way to commercial self-interest, or that a rebuke is worth bearing. 
Either way, China's leaders will not put international outrage above any internal threats to their iron rule. The proletariat and peasantry, whom they claim to represent, pose a restive threat to ""stability"", as iron-rice-bowl jobs are lost and new jobs are hard to find. Some western analysts think that China's economy is through the worst of its troubles. Indeed, on December 3oth the government announced the economy had grown by a remarkable 7.8% in 1998-not far short of the 8% target that China's leaders had ""guaranteed"". But Chinese statistics are not reliable, and the growth figures have been hugely inflated. 
Moreover, the coming year is full of events whose political symbolism the party alone must define, among them the 5oth anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic and the return of Macau, a Portuguese enclave, to the ""motherland"". The jailing of dissidents is just one way the Chinese government is setting the tone. 
President Jiang Zemin has recently given stern speeches promising to nip dissent ""in the bud"". Fresh threats have been issued to workers thinking of organising independently. New rules threaten film directors, singers and software developers with life imprisonment if they ""endanger national security"". And on the edges of China's empire, the rhetoric has been turned up. In the western province of Xinjiang, the party secretary declares that the situation there is getting ""acute and complicated"", justification for hardline vigilance. 
The combination of a new political chill together with evidence of delay in some of China's most pressing economic reforms has shaken the assumptions of many western observers. Some have even begun to wonder aloud whether China's ""reform period"" is drawing to a close. But nothing has really changed. Since the Tiananmen threat to one-party rule, the Communists' determination ought not to have been in doubt: reforms and greater openness of expression, though welcome in principle, will not willingly be allowed at the expense of Communist authority.  1999 More bombast than policy on both sides as America and Britain confront Iraq 
IT IS easier to start a fight with Iraq than to end one. So America and Britain discovered when they called off their four-day bombing campaign against Iraq on December 19th, only to find the Iraqis taking repeated pot-shots at their pilots ten days later amid a row over the ""no-fly zones"" that cover half the country. So, indeed, the past eight years have shown, as successive American and British governments have enforced the sanctions imposed on Iraq after it invaded Kuwait in 199o. Has the latest episode brought a conclusion any closer? 
The bombing did put an end, at least for the time being, to the work of Unscom, the United Nations body charged with disposing of Iraq's deadliest weapons. In the wake of the American and British attack, Iraq announced that the arms inspectors, who had fled the country hours before the bombing began, would not be allowed back. 
Never fear, insisted American officials, their bombs had made a significant dent in Saddam Hussein's weapons programmes. General Henry Shelton, America's top soldier, announced that nine Iraqi missile factories had been put out of operation ""for at least a year"", while his British counterpart proudly described the destruction of special aircraft designed to spray biological and chemical stuff. The two powers also claimed to have blitzed barracks, ministries, presidential palaces and various factories that might otherwise, they said, have been put to nefarious purposes. 
But the Iraqis are dab hands at hiding their assets, as Unscom's inspectors have long complained. They shrugged off the attacks, insisting, quite credibly, that most of the destroyed buildings had already been emptied of men and machinery. One serving Unscom inspector questioned the usefulness of the bombing; he might also have asked why, if America and Britain knew where to find Mr Hussein's secret weapons, they had not let the inspectors know. 
Much of the rest of the world was equally unimpressed. Russia's President Boris Yeltsin called the strikes ""illegal and senseless"" and briefly recalled his ambassadors from America and Britain. France protested by pulling its aircraft out of the force that has been patrolling the no-fly zone over southern Iraq (it had earlier withdrawn from the northern patrol) Arabs took to the streets throughout the Middle East, storming the American embassy in Damascus and demonstrating in Rabat. Their embarrassed governments protested more mutedly, but did complain that the bombing had undermined any hope of persuading Iraq to co-operate with the UN and thus be rehabilitated into the world. 
America and Britain retort that they are as keen as everyone else to sort out the whole mess. After they called off their bombers, they produced a new five-point strategy for dealing with Iraq. They will keep up their threat of force, encourage the Iraqi opposition, try to get inspections under way again, step up patrols of the Gulf against sanctions-busting smugglers and launch a diplomatic offensive to bring the world round to their point of view. 
As energetic as all this sounds, it amounts to almost nothing. Mr Hussein has weathered many bombings, and doubtless thinks he can survive a few more. The Iraqi opposition is laughable, and the $97m earmarked for it by America even more so (each of the 325 cruise missiles fired at Iraq during the bombing campaign cost $1.2m) America's only plan to get the inspectors back into Iraq is to refuse to lift sanctions until they have finished their work. Although smugglers do get round the sanctions, they do so chiefly through Iran and Syria, where America has little influence, or through Turkey, where it winks at the infractions. And America is already trying to persuade the rest of the world to swallow its Iraqi policy, with ever-dwindling success. Essentially, America and Britain plan to let Iraq stew. 
The Iraqis complain that they have been left to stew painfully for eight years under the most all-encompassing sanctions in history, with no hope of a reprieve. All along Mr Hussein has tried to protest and prod until the international consensus on sanctions falls apart. Although frustrating Unscom was his favourite means of attracting attention, he is already testing new methods of challenging America's stranglehold. The current spate of attacks on aircraft in the no-fly zone, or his renewed threat to end the UN's humanitarian programme, could both bring about a new crisis. 
So far, no country has broken ranks and openly defied the sanctions, although several-especially the Arab states-have called for their lifting. But with Unscom out of action, it will become ever harder for the Americans to argue that the unending embargo is designed to enforce the internationally accepted aim of arms control, rather than to serve America's and Britain's interest in keeping Mr Hussein (together with the unfortunate Iraqi people) contained in a cage. Iraq has complained that Arab foreign ministers delayed a meeting to discuss the situation at the behest of such good American allies as Saudi Arabia. They are unlikely to delay for ever.  1999 ISRAEL'S parliament, the Knesset, having deposed Binyamin Netanyahu and dissolved itself, has now decided on a ludicrously long election campaign of nearly five months. The vote will take place on May 17th, with the likely run-off vote for prime minister to be held on June ist. 
The decision to drag it out-the law allows for an election within two monthscame in consultations this week between Mr Netanyahu's Likud and the opposition Labour Party, led by Ehud Barak. Both are seriously rattled by the meteoric rise to the top of the opinion polls of Amnon LipkinShahak, the recently retired army chief of staff. Mr Shahak, blue-eyed and soft-spoken, has yet formally to declare his candidacy for prime minister, at the head of a new centrist party. But he is already attracting defectors from both the big parties, as well as promises of support from businessmen. Mr Netanyahu and Mr Barak both hope that Mr Shahak has peaked too soon and that a long and costly campaign will exhaust his appeal. 
Some in the peace camp, including Israel's convention-flouting president, Ezer Weizman, fear that Mr Barak (also a former chief of staff) and Mr Shahak will exhaust each other, with Mr Netanyahu reaping the benefit. But others argue that Mr Shahak's candidacy could help draw those traditionally opposed to Labour away from the Likud candidate in the first round. Then, if Mr Netanyahu and Mr Barak made it to the run-off, Mr Shahak would urge his supporters to back Mr Barak. If Mr Shahak got through, Mr Barak would obviously support him against Mr Netanyahu. And a strong showing by the centrist party in the vote for the Knesset, say the optimists, might give Mr Barak or Mr Shahak, if either won the prime ministership, the chance to set up a broad coalition without the Likud. 
Mr Barak's need to break down the old voting patterns has prompted him to offer a haven to Mr Netanyahu's former foreign minister, David Levy, one of the many politicians to have become unmoored in the storm.A month ago, Mr Netanyahu suggested that Mr Levy should return to the Likud, and to the cabinet, as minister of finance. But they argued, both over policy and over the reabsorption of Mr Levy's breakaway Gesher faction into the mother-party. Now Mr Levy, once a bricklayer and always a champion of the have-nots, has turned to Labour, saying that Mr Barak is ""the only candidate speaking clearly"" on social issues. 
Mr Barak hopes that Mr Levy's advent will persuade others in the Labour Party not to bolt for the centre-though the Labour air is thick with restless threats. In the Likud, the bolting has begun. Dan Meridor, whom Mr Netanyahu forced out of his cabinet a year ago, has left the party and announced his candidacy for prime minister as a centrist (he and Mr Shahak will eventually decide between them who will be the candidate and who the number two). And Benny Begin, also once a minister under Mr Netanyahu, has proclaimed a new party of the right, loyal to the Likud's nowcompromised belief in Greater Israel, with himself as its leader and candidate for prime minister. 
Mr Netanyahu is now desperately trying to dissuade the popular minister of defence, Yitzhak Mordechai, and the lone woman in his cabinet, Limor Livnat, from joining the centrists. He is also troubled by hints from the foreign minister, Ariel Sharon, his staunchest ally in recent months, that ""in special circumstances"" he would consider standing for prime minister. 
Mr Netanyahu is not done for yet. He surged from behind to defeat Shimon Peres in 1996, and this time he is both the underdog and the incumbent. His brand of raw rhetoric on the hustings and his manipulative skills should thrive in these conditions. 
But his failure to keep Mr Meridor and Mr Begin inside his depleted tent could prove fatal. These two, both princes of the Likud blood (Mr Meridor's father was a comrade-in-arms of Menachem Begin, the party's founder), and both widely respected for their honesty, will be pounding away throughout the campaign at Mr Netanyahu's weakest spot: his credibility. His way of winning power, and then holding together a creaky coalition for 30 months, has been to tell people, all people, whatever they wanted to hear. Now, with elections approaching, they are comparing notes.  1999 ISRAEL'S parliament, the Knesset, having deposed Binyamin Netanyahu and dissolved itself, has now decided on a ludicrously long election campaign of nearly five months.

His way of winning power, and then holding together a creaky coalition for 30 months, has been to tell people, all people, whatever they wanted to hear. Now, with elections approaching, they are comparing notes.  1999 HELL and heaven are separated by a 20minute drive along clogged streets. The centre of Angola's capital, Luanda, is a wasteland of piled-up rubbish, broken pavements and broken people; amputees from the war and its landmines beg at every corner. At the United Nations base on the outskirts of Luanda, freshly watered herbaceous borders run between rows of mobile homes. To keep the UN bureaucrats healthy and happy there are tennis courts and a swimming pool plus an all-American bar where beer can be bought only with dollars. 
The government blames this haven of peace for the resurgence of the country's civil war in early December, venomously attacking the UN Observer Mission in Angola for incompetence. It claims that, if the UN had been doing its job properly, Jonas Savimbi, the UNITA rebel leader, would not have been able to stockpile weapons when, under the terms of the 1994 Lusaka protocol, he should have been handing them in. 
They have a point. The UN's strategy was to make the most of the peace process in order to keep it going. UN officials regularly announced how many weapons had been handed in and how many soldiers and rebels were being demobilised at UN assembly points. No matter that many of the weapons were rusty and many ofthe UNITA ""soldiers"" at the centres were mere boys recruited a few weeks before. 
But if the UN failed to spot Mr Savimbi's shopping habits in the world's arms markets, it also failed to draw attention to the government's crude lack of interest in a true peace. In territory abandoned by UNITA, where people were desperate for food and medicine, the government instead sent in thuggish policemen who, without supplies of their own, stole the last local food stocks. 
On December 5th, the Angolan army attacked UNITA'S strongholds at Andulo and Bailundo in the central highlands. At the same time, the ruling MPLA party, holding its annual congress in Luanda, replaced many veteran members with more military-minded men. The shuffle clearly signalled all-out war: the party bosses were hoping to plant the government flag in the heart of the territory that Mr Savimbi once held. 
Most thought that would be easy. The rebels have no outside allies left. They are supposedly cut off by UN sanctions from both weapons suppliers and diamond buyers, and they have been weakened by attacks on their rear bases in Congo. But Mr Savimbi's forces proved stronger than expected and, by December 9th, UNITA was announcing that the government forces were in retreat ""having been beaten at their own game"". They were sent reeling as far as Kuito, which UNITA seemed on the point of seizing. Except that, at that point, the rebels ran out of petrol. 
Angola makes $2 billion-3 billion a year from oil, and UNITA usually has no difficulty finding supplies. This time, however, the rebels did not expect to find themselves advancing so fast. Like everyone else, they had overestimated government strength, and underestimated their own. 
This gave the government a chance to regroup. The rebels set about shelling Kuito and fierce fighting is reported in Bie and Huambo provinces. On December 26th a uN-chartered flight with four crew and ten UN officials crashed near Huambo. Both sides accuse the other of shooting it down. 
Four days after the crash, the UN'S special representative, Issa Diallo, was still trying to get a local ceasefire to allow a search mission to look for survivors. The government said the aircraft had come down in UNITA-held territory and so it was not their business. The rebels denied having received any request from Mr Diallo until late on December 28th. UNITA also says that the government is carrying out air strikes on its headquarters, making communication impossible. 
In short, neither side has shown the slightest interest in helping Mr Diallo look for the missing 14 people, let alone agreeing to a ceasefire or trying to work out a way of ending the war.  1999 The AIDS virus had infected 47m people, and shows no signs of slowing. It cannot be cured. Can it be curbed? 
IN RICH countries AIDS is no longer a death sentence. Expensive drugs keep Hv-positive patients alive and healthy, perhaps indefinitely. Loud public-awareness campaigns keep the number of infected Americans,Japanese and West Europeans to relatively low levels. The sense of crisis is past. 
In developing countries, by contrast, the disease is spreading like nerve gas in a gentle breeze. The poor cannot afford to spend $lo,ooo a year on wonder-pills. Millions of Africans are dying. In the longer term, even greater numbers of Asians are at risk. For many poor countries, there is no greater or more immediate threat to public health and economic growth. Yet few political leaders treat it as a priority. 
Since HIV was first identified in the 1970s, over 47m people have been infected, of whom 14m have died. Last year saw the biggest annual death toll yet: 2.5m. The disease now ranks fourth among the world's big killers, after respiratory infections, diarrhoeal disorders and tuberculosis. It now claims many more lives each year than malaria, a growing menace, and is still nowhere near its peak. If India, China and other Asian countries do not take it seriously, the number of infections could reach ""a new order of magnitude"", says Peter Piot, head of the UN'S AIDS programme. 
The human immuno-deficiency virus (HiV), which causes acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDs) is thought to have crossed from chimpanzees to humans in the late 19q.os or early 1950s in Congo. It took several years for the virus to break out of Congo's dense and sparsely populated jungles but, once it did, it marched with rebel armies through the continent's numerous war zones, rode with truckers from one rest-stop brothel to the next, and eventually flew, perhaps with an air steward, to America, where it was discovered in the early 1980s. As American homosexuals and drug injectors started to wake up to the dangers of bath-houses and needle-sharing, AIDS was already devastating Africa. 
So far, the worst-hit areas are east and southern Africa. In Botswana, Namibia, Swaziland and Zimbabwe, between a fifth and a quarter of people aged 15-49 are afflicted with HIV or AIDS. In Botswana, children born early in the next decade will have a life expectancy of 40; without AIDS, it would have been nearer 7o. Of the 25 monitoring sites in Zimbabwe where pregnant women are tested for HIV, only two in 1997 showed prevalence below lO%. At the remaining 23 sites, 20-5o% of women were infected. About a third of these women will pass the virus on to their babies. 
The region's giant, South Africa, was largely protected by its isolation from the rest of the world during the apartheid years. Now it is host to one in ten of the world's new infections-more than any other country. In the country's most populous province, KwaZulu-Natal, perhaps a third of sexually active adults are HIV-positive. 
Asia is the next disaster-in-waiting. Already, 7m Asians are infected. India's 930m people look increasingly vulnerable. The Indian countryside, which most people imagined relatively AIDs-free, turns out not to be. A recent study in Tamil Nadu found over 2% of rural people to be Hiv-positive: 500,ooo people in one of India's smallest states. Since lO% had other sexually transmitted diseases (STDS), the avenue for further infections is clearly open. A survey of female STD patients in Poona, in Maharashtra, found that over 9o% had never had sex with anyone but their husband; and yet 13.6% had HIv. China is not far behind. 
No one knows what AIDS will do to poor countries' economies, for nowhere has the epidemic run its course. An optimistic assessment, by Alan Whiteside of the University of Natal, suggests that the effect of AIDS on measurable GDP will be slight Even at high prevalence, Mr Whiteside thinks it will slow growth by no more than o.6% a year. This is because so many people in poor countries do not contribute much to the formal economy. To put it even more crudely, where there is a huge oversupply of unskilled labour, the dead can easily be replaced. Some people argue that those who survive the epidemic will benefit from a tighter job market. After the Black Death killed a third of the population of medieval Europe, labour scarcity forced landowners to pay their workers better. 
Other researchers are more pessimistic. AIDS takes longer to kill than did the plague, so the cost of caring for the sick will be more crippling. Modern governments, unlike medieval ones, tax the healthy to help look after the ailing, so the burden will fall on everyone. And AIDS, because it is sexually transmitted, tends to hit the most energetic and productive members of society. A recent study in Namibia estimated that AIDS cost the country almost 8% of GNP in 6. Another analysis predicts that Kenya's GDP will be 14.5% smaller in zoos than it would have been without AIDS, and that income per person will be lo% lower. 
The cost of the disease 
In general, the more advanced the economy, the worse it will be affected by a large number of AIDS deaths. South Africa, with its advanced industries, already suffers a shortage of skilled manpower, and cannot afford to lose more. In better-off developing countries, people have more savings to fall back on when they need to pay medical bills. Where people have health and life insurance, those industries will be hit by bigger claims. Insurers protect themselves by charging more or refusing policies to HIVpositive customers. In Zimbabwe, life-insurance premiums quadrupled in two years because of AIDS. Higher premiums force more people to seek treatment in public hospitals: in South Africa, HIV and AIDS could account for between 35% and 84% of public-health expenditure by zoos, according to one projection. 
Little research has been done into the effects of AIDS on private business, but the anecdotal evidence is scary. In some countries, firms have had to limit the number of days employees may take off to attend funerals. Zambia is suffering power shortages because so many engineers have died. Farmers in Zimbabwe are finding it hard to irrigate their fields because the brass fittings on their water pipes are stolen for coffin handles. In South Africa, where employers above a certain size are obliged to offer generous benefits and paid sick leave, companies will find many of their staff, as they sicken, becoming more expensive and less productive. Yet few firms are trying to raise awareness of AIDS among their workers, or considering how they will cope. 
In the public sector, where pensions and health benefits are often more generOUS, AIDS could break budgets and hobble the provision of services. In South Africa, an estimated 15% of civil servants are HIVpositive, but government departments have made little effort to plan for the coming surge in sickness. Education, too, will suffer. In Botswana, 2-5% of teachers die each year from AIDS. Many more take extended sick leave. 
At a macro level, the impact of AIDS is felt gradually. But at a household level, the blow is sudden and catastrophic. When a breadwinner develops AIDS, his (or her) family is impoverished twice over: his income vanishes, and his relations must devote time and money to nursing him. Daughters are often forced to drop out of school to help. Worse, HIV tends not to strike just one member of a family. Husbands give it to wives, mothers to babies. This correspondent's driver in Kampala lost his mother, his father, two brothers and their wives to AIDS. His story is not rare. 
Obstacles to prevention 
The best hope for halting the epidemic is a cheap vaccine. Efforts are under way, but a vaccine for a virus that mutates as rapidly as HIV will be hugely difficult and expensive to invent. For poor countries, the only practical course is to concentrate on prevention. But this, too, will be hard, for a plethora of reasons. 
Sex is fun . . . Many feel that condoms make it less so. Zimbabweans ask: ""Would you eat a sweet with its wrapper on?"" e.. . and discussion of it often taboo. In Kenya, Christian and Islamic groups have publicly burned anti-AIDS leaflets and condoms, as a protest against what they see as the encouragement of promiscuity. A study in Thailand found that infected women were only a fifth as likely to have discussed sex openly with their partners as were uninfected women. 
Myths abound. Some young African women believe that without regular infusions of sperm, they will not grow up to be beautiful. Ugandan men use this myth to seduce schoolgirls. In much of southern Africa, HIV-infected men believe that they can rid themselves of the virus by passing it on to a virgin. 
Poverty. Those who cannot afford television find other ways of passing the evening. People cannot afford antibiotics, so the untreated sores from STDS provide easy openings for HIV. 
Migrant labour. Since wages are much higher in South Africa than in the surrounding region, outsiders flock in to find work. Migrant miners (including South Africans forced to live far from their homes) spend most of the year in single-sex dormitories surrounded by prostitutes. Living with a one-in-4o chance of being killed by a rockfall, they are inured to risk. When they go home, they often infect their wives. 
War. Refugees, whether from genocide in Rwanda or state persecution in Myanmar, spread Hiv as they flee. Soldiers, with their regular pay and disdain for risk, are more likely than civilians to contract HIV from prostitutes. When they go to war, they infect others. In Africa the problem is dire. In Congo, where no fewer than seven armies are embroiled, the government has accused Ugandan troops (which are helping the Congolese rebels) of deliberately spreading AIDS. Unlikely, but with estimated HIV prevalence in the seven armies ranging from so% for the Angolans to an incredible 80% for the Zimbabweans, the effect is much the same. 
Sexism. In most poor countries, it is hard for a woman to ask her partner to use a condom. Wives who insist risk being beaten up. Rape is common, especially where wars rage. Forced sex is a particularly effective means of Hiv transmission, because of the extra blood. 
Drinking. Asia and Africa make many excellent beers. They are also home to a lot of people for whom alcohol is the quickest escape from the stresses of acute poverty. Drunken lovers are less likely to remember to use condoms. 
How to fight the virus 
Pessimists look at that list and despair. But three success stories show that the hurdles to prevention are not impossibly high. 
First, Thailand. One secret of Thailand's success has been timely, accurate information-gathering. HIV was first detected in Thailand in the mid-198os, among male homosexuals. The health ministry immediately began to monitor other high-risk groups, particularly the country's many heroin addicts and prostitutes. In the first half of 1988, HIV prevalence among drug injectors tested at one Bangkok hospital leapt from 1% to 30%. Shortly afterwards, infections soared among prostitutes. 
The response was swift. A survey of Thai sexual behaviour was conducted. The results, which showed men indulging in a phenomenal amount of unprotected commercial sex, were publicised. Thais were warned that a major epidemic would strike if their habits did not change. A ""100% condom use"" campaign persuaded prostitutes to insist on protection 90% of the time with non-regular customers. 
By the mid-199os, the government was spending $8om a year on AIDs education and palliative care. In 1990-93, the proportion of adult men reporting non-marital sex was halved, from 28% to 15%; for women, it fell from 1.7% to 0.4%. Brothel visits slumped. Only lO% of men reported seeing a prostitute in 1993, down from 22% in 199o. Among army conscripts in northern Thailand, a group both highly sexed and well-monitored, the proportion admitting to paying for sex fell from 57% in 1991 to 24% in 1995. The proportion claiming to have used condoms at their last commercial entanglement rose from 61% in 1991 to 93% in 1995. 
People lie about sex, so reported good behaviour does not necessarily mean actual good behaviour. But tumbling infections suggest that not everyone was fibbing. The number of sexually transmitted diseases reported from government clinics fell from over 4oo,ooo in 1986 to under 50,ooo in 1995. Among northern conscripts, Hrv prevalence fell by half between 1993 and 1995, from over 7% to under 3.5%. 
Most striking was the government's success in persuading people that they were at risk long before they started to see acquaintances die from AIDS. There was no attempt to play down the spread of HIV to avoid scaring off tourists, as happened in Kenya. Thais were repeatedly warned of the dangers, told how to avoid them, and left to make their own choices. Most decided that a long life was preferable to a fast one. 
Second, Uganda Thailand shows what is possible in a well-educated, fairly prosperous country. Uganda shows that there is hope even for countries that are poor and barely literate. President Yoweri Museveni recognised the threat shortly after becoming president in 1986, and deluged the country with anti-AIDs warnings. 
The key to Uganda's success is twofold. First, Mr Museveni made every government department take the problem seriously, and implement its own plan to fight the virus. Accurate surveys of sexual behaviour were done for only $20,ooo-30,ooo each. Second, he recognised that his government could do only a limited amount, so he gave free rein to scores of non-governmental organisations (NGos), usually foreign-financed, to do whatever it took to educate people about risky sex. 
The Straight Talk Foundation, for example, goes beyond simple warnings about AIDS and deals with the confusing complexities of sex. Its staff run role-playing exercises in Uganda's schools to teach adolescents how to deal with romantic situations. Its newsletter, distributed free, covers everything from nocturnal emissions to what to do if raped. Visiting AIDS workers from South Africa and Zimbabwe asked the foundation's director, Catharine Watson, how she won government permission to hand out such explicit material, and were astonished to hear that she had not felt the need to ask. 
The climate of free debate has led Ugandans to delay their sexual activity, to have fewer partners, and to use more condoms. Between 1991 and 1996, HIV prevalence among women in urban ante-natal clinics fell by half, from roughly 30% to 15%. 
Third, Senegal. If Uganda shows how a poor country can reverse the track of an epidemic, Senegal shows how to stop it from taking off in the first place. This West African country was fortunate to be several thousand miles from HIS origin. In the mid-i98os, when other parts of Africa were already blighted, Senegal was still relatively AIDs-free. In concert with non-governmental organisations and the press and broadcasters, the government set up a national AIDs-control programme to keep it that way. 
In Senegal's brothels, which had been regulated since the early 1970s, condom use was firmly encouraged. The country's blood supply was screened early and effectively. Vigorous education resulted in 95% of Senegalese adults knowing how to avoid the virus. Condom sales soared from 800,000 in 1988 to 7m in 1997. Senegalese levels of infection have remained stable and low for a decade-at around 1.2% among pregnant women. 
Contrast these three with South Africa. On December ist, World AIDS Day, President Nelson Mandela told the people of KwaZulu-Natal that HIV would devastate their communities if not checked. The speech was remarkable not for its qualityMr Mandela is always able to move audiences-but for its rarity. Unlike Mr Museveni, South Africa's leader seldom uses his authority to encourage safer sex It is a tragic omission. Whereas the potholed streets of Kampala are lined with signs promoting fidelity and condoms, this correspondent has, in eight months in South Africa, seen only two anti-AIDs posters, both in the UN'S AIDS office in Pretoria. 
How to dither and die 
South Africa has resources and skills on a scale that Uganda can only marvel at. It even has an excellent AIDs prevention plan, accepted by the new cabinet in 1994. But the plan was never implemented. The government likes to consult every conceivable ""stakeholder"", so new plans are eternally drafted and redrafted. Local authorities cannot act without orders from the central government. NGOS, many of them dependent on the powers-that-be for their finance, waste months making sure that enough of their senior management posts are filled with blacks to satisfy the ruling African National Congress. And they have minimal freedom to experiment. 
""There's an idea that if you disagree with the government, you are betraying the liberation struggle,"" says Mary Crewe, head of the Greater Johannesburg AIDS project. As a result, soldiers in the South African army are so ignorant that they snip the tips off their free condoms, and HIV has spread through South Africa as fast, according to Dr Neil McKerrow of Grey's Hospital in Pietermaritzburg, as if no preventive measures at all had been taken. 
Such bungling is not unique to South Africa. Most governments have been slow to recognise the threat from AIDS. From Bulawayo to Beijing, apathy and embarrassment have hamstrung preventive efforts. 
In anarchic countries, such as Congo and Angola, there have been almost no preventive efforts. Many people believe that the cause-a bid to restrain one of the most basic human instincts-is hopeless. As a Zimbabwean novelist, Chenjerai Hove, puts it with disturbing fatalism: ""Since our women dress to kill, we are all going to die."" But if the sexual drive is basic, so is the desire to live. If governments in poor countries wake up to the need to persuade their citizens that unprotected sex is Russian roulette, Mr Hove could be proved wrong. 
This article is indebted to a number of UNAIDS reports, including AIDS epidemic update (December i998, AIDS in Africa (November i9981 and ""A measure of success in Uganda (May 1998).  1999 1999 will not be just the year the euro was born. With Germany presiding for the next six months, the European Union has a host of other challenges 
JUST as well that the current crop of European Union leaders managed to rub along easily enough at their pre-Christmas summit in Vienna. They will be seeing a great deal more of one another in the year ahead, and in more trying circumstances. Vienna was a holding operation. Difficult questions were left for tackling at further summits in the course of 1999. Now several crunches are coming. 
The main event written into European diplomatic diaries for the first half of 1999 is a special summit in Brussels on March 24th and 25th. Here the 15 national leaders, and the European Commission as their servant, will try to reach agreement on new rules to limit EU spending from 2000 to 2006. All agree that budget reforms are essential, if the EU is to start admitting poorer countries from Central and Eastern Europe within that period. Without reforms, expansion will entail huge new spending obligations. But there are fierce differences of opinion over exactly what changes to make. 
Nobody is quite satisfied with ""Agenda 2000"", the package of tweaks and trims proposed by the commission as the basis for argument. France wants to keep farm subsidies high: it claims they are part of the Eu's ""spirit and heritage"", though the real point is that France happens to be their main beneficiary. Spain opposes cuts in regional subsidies with much the same logic. Germany wants its net contribution of $13 billion to the EU budget to be cut by at least a third. Britain wants to protect the special rebate mechanism won 15 years ago by Margaret Thatcher. Eight countries think that EU spending, roughly $100 billion in 1998, should be frozen in real terms for the foreseeable future, whereas seven are opposed or undecided. 
The main work of finding a compromise in all this will bear on Germany, which holds the Union's presidency during the first half of 1999. The timing is awkward: Germany's new Social DemocraticGreen government is still unsteady on its feet, and prone to send out erratic signals. Some countries doubt that the March deadline for a budget deal can be met, however diligent the presidency's work. 
But Germany's top diplomat in Brussels, Dietrich von Kyaw, refuses even to contemplate a postponement. He fears that failure to reach agreement in March would further set back the already much-delayed business of enlargement. He thinks the impression of a serious row among governments might rock the EU's new-born currency, the euro. And he doubts that they would be more accommodating if given more time. All countries, he says, ""will have to give up certain things to which we have become accustomed, things we feel entitled to get"" And lest finance ministers and foreign ministers appear unequal to the sacrifice, there were mutterings in Vienna about holding yet another meeting of heads of government in Bonn in February, before the Brussels summit, though Germany hopes this ""mini-summit"" will not be necessary. 
If a deal on Agenda 2000 can be reached in March, EU leaders will be spared one another's company until June. That is when they assemble in Cologne for a summit rounding off the German presidency. The agenda is likely to include the adoption of a largely symbolic ""employment pact"" for Europe, an idea pushed hard by France. The Union's leaders may well choose a new president for the European Commission and a new ""high representative"" for foreign policy(see page 48). 
But another item pencilled in for the Cologne agenda may give rise to yet another special summit-to convene a new and certainly gruelling ""inter-governmental conference"" for tidying up the EU'S constitutional arrangements. Finland, which assumes the Union's presidency on July ist, has indicated its readiness to play host to the launch of such a conference in the second half of 1999-hoping, no doubt, that a new constitutional shindig might proceed with more gusto than the one that dragged ineffectually along in the run-up to the Amsterdam summit of 1997. 
As with the financial reforms proposed in Agenda 2000,the constitutional reforms would prepare the way for enlarging the Union. If and when more countries join, for example, a new formula will be needed to fix the number of European commissioners (whose job it is to propose legislation and to run the Eu bureaucracy). The present system, whereby big countries send two commissioners to Brussels and small countries one, means an over-generous 20 commissioners already. Another area for reform concerns the Council of Ministers: countries will have to accept the wider use of majority voting there, if legislation is not to be blocked wholesale by a proliferation of national vetoes. New rules are also needed to make the voting power of each country in the council more proportionate to its size: the present system gives small countries a disproportionately big say. 
All this is delicate business. Other potential sources of tension ahead include a worsening trade row with America (sparked by an argument about bananas); the possibility of renewed fighting in Kosovo; and the pursuit, at Germany's insistence, of more effective tax ""harmonisation"" across Europe. Add to this the arrival of the euro, and elections for the European Parliament in mid-June: the implication is that EU issues will dominate national agendas in 1999 in a way not seen since the signing of the Maastricht treaty almost eight years earlier. So when the Union's leaders assemble yet again, in December in Helsinki to mark the end of the Finnish presidency, do not be surprised if their smiles look just a little strained.  1999 ARUSSIAN'S mental map of the world paints America large and everywhere else small. The United States counts for most in high matters-diplomacy and finance-as well as practical ones: the dollar, for example, is Russians' best-trusted currency for saving and commerce. Though Germany counts for a lot, Western Europe as an entity has never engaged Russian attention. 
Could this be changing? Certainly the European Union has never mattered more to Russian policymakers. The hottest topic is trade. The EU is already Russia's biggest single trading partner, with about 40% of the total. Now Russian exporters want to use the rouble's collapse (by more than two-thirds since August) to sell as much cheap steel, textiles, paper and so on to Western Europe as possible. But they are intimidated by the bureaucracy and protectionism of Brussels. So the government is lobbying on their behalf, with mixed success. ""It would be easier to push the Russians' case on steel if they had fully taken up their existing quota,"" sniffs a sympathetic Eurocrat. 
Russians also fear that EU protectionism may squeeze them out of markets in those bits of the former Soviet empire, such as Poland, now bent on joining the EU. ""There will be direct or indirect pressure for big contracts to go to western suppliers, not eastern ones,"" worries a Russian involved in trade finance. 
The Eu's expansion also has a political price. Central European countries are toughening visa regimes and customs services, making it harder for Russians to go and do business there. If Slovakia, Lithuania and Latvia also join the EU, Russia's remaining influence in the region would be pushed back still farther. 
But there are compensations. Russia sees the Eu as more sympathetic than America: just as rich, but less driven by superpower thinking. ""Europe is a better partner for us, less demanding,"" says Vladimir Ryzhkov, a rising young politician. European socialists' carping at the supposedly heartless policies inflicted on Russia by American neo-liberals strikes a melodious chord in Russian ruling circles. 
Still, for all their talk of a ""missing social dimension"", European governments are still likely to take their cue from Washington when it comes to another bail-out for Russia-of which there is currently no sign. The EU'S own efforts have been mostly unimpressive. The most recent idea, $5oom in food aid, has been a blatantly self-interested move by Europe's farm lobby. Most other EU aid so far has been technical advice, often not followed, and valuable chiefly to the well-paid western consulting firms that deliver it. 
But even this may be changing a bit. The European Parliament is reviewing the technical-aid budget. Lobbying by Germany and Finland, among others, has delayed the food-aid package. There are signs of a new emphasis on dealing with the Russian regions, especially those closest to Western Europe, such as Smolensk. When Finland takes over the EU'S presidency in mid-1999, it will launch a ""northern dimension"", aimed at giving greater oomph to Eu engagement in the Baltic states and north-western Russia. 
For most Russians, the biggest practical change will be the euro. Russian importers and exporters are waking up to the need to keep accounts in euros. When they become available in physical form, Russian savers may start hedging their currency exposure, by stuffing their mattresses with euros as well as greenbacks. Those who move cash in suitcases are especially pleased: the 50o note (worth around $425), they note with approval, will be much handier than four or five of those rather inadequate $too notes.  1999 Gerhard Schroder, the new chancellor, has profited from a row with a colleague to start asserting his authority 
WHEN Gerhard Schroder lets slip a beam of quiet triumph these days, the chances are someone has mentioned Jurgen Trittin. How so? Isn't Mr Trittin the Green environment minister at the centre of a row over atomic power that some pundits claim might even split the coalition with Mr Schroder's Social Democrats? 
So he is. But Mr Trittin has also, more or less unwittingly, given the chancellor an ideal chance to show who is boss. And Mr Schroder, widely deemed indecisive since he took over two months ago, has seized it with relish. Hitherto most of his problems have been with his own party and its powerful chairman, Oskar Lafontaine, who is also finance minister. The Greens are much easier to use as a whipping-boy. 
At first glance, the coalition's nuclear scrap may seem odd. After all, both partners, unlike the previous centre-right government under Helmut Kohl, are pledged to shut down all 19 of Germany's atomic plants, which generate about a third of the country's electricity. But, crucially, they differ on timing and tactics. The Social Democrats have said that, given the political will, Germany could be nuclear-free in ten years; the Greens say five years, and threaten footdraggers with penalties. 
Not so Mr Schroder and the economics minister, Werner Muller, a non-party energy expert. They want the phasing-out to be done with the consent of industry. It would then take much longer than the hardliners believe. Otherwise the government might be hit by demands for vast compensation, not just from the domestic nuclear industry but also from French and British firms with long-term contracts to reprocess German atomic waste. A messy confrontation in the courts could delay plant closures indefinitely. 
Hence a hush-hush meeting between Messrs Schroder and Muller with energy company supremos in Bonn on December 14th, when a long-term deal's outline was sketched. Under it, the utilities would close all nuclear plants by 2019, starting in the next year or two with some of the oldest, provided the government did not flood them with regulations in the meantime. 
The pow-wow not only further upset Social Democratic zealots who have long snarled that Mr Schroder, a former member of Volkswagen's supervisory board, is too close to the bosses. It also infuriated Mr Trittin, who was neither invited nor officially informed of the result, though he is directly responsible for nuclear matters. In an apparent tit for tat, he announced he was sacking the members of two committees responsible for reactor safety and radiation protection on the ground that they were too friendly to the nuclear industry. 
Now it was Mr Schroder's turn to be livid, or at least to seem to be. Out came a statement stressing that Mr Trittin had acted without consulting the chancellery, and that this was no time for ""pompous posturing and party political symbolism"". Old Bonn hands recalled no comparable public dressing-down of a minister since the last days of the centre-left coalition under Helmut Schmidt in 1982. Hence speculation that the Schroder coalition too might be almost on the rocks. 
Probably not. True, ridding Germany of atomic power is even more of a core issue for the Greens than it is for the Social Democrats; but that is exactly why they cannot afford to stomp out of the coalition. So after more huffing and puffing a compromise will probably be hammered out at coalition talks set for January 13th. 
At any rate, Mr Trittin's relations with Mr Schroder can hardly be ""damaged beyond repair"", as some claim. Soon after the chancellor's ""pompous posturing"" charge, the pair were spotted tucking into lunch together at a Hanover restaurant They are, after all, old allies as well as sparring partners, dating back to the early 199os when Mr Schroder was in his first term as premier of Lower Saxony and Mr Trittin was in his red-Green cabinet. 
What the row does show is how Mr Schroder is step by step trying to widen his room for manoeuvre, constrained since September by two events. The first was the election result itself, which gave an unexpectedly clear parliamentary majority of21 seats to a red-Green combination and boosted the influence of the Social Democratic left under Mr Lafontaine. The second was the coalition negotiation, which was too hastily rushed through and which Mr Schroder rashly left too heavily in Mr Lafontaine's acquisitive hands. 
Since then, to jeers of ""Where is Schroder?"" even from newspapers which had been hostile to Mr Kohl, he has been seeking to claw more influence. After a skirmish with Mr Lafontaine, he took away from the finance ministry responsibility for preparing the German position at the G8 rich countries' meetings and gave it to his own economic adviser in the chancellery. Responsibility for planning economic reconstruction in ex-communist eastern Germany has been centred on the chancellery too. And Mr Schroder's chief of staff, Bodo Hombach, has been co-ordinating the ""alliance for work"" talks between government, employers and trade unions to find jobs for Germany's 4m jobless. 
Like Mr Schmidt, Mr Schroder is trying to turn his chancellery into a combination of power-house and think-tank. Like Mr Schmidt, he is running into plenty of opposition from his own party, as well as from his coalition partner. But he is beginning to get his way.  1999 DOUBLE tragedy continues to unfold in Transylvania, the northwestern chunk of Romania that has been a haven for ethnic Germans for some eight centuries. First is the fast disappearance of an extraordinary cultural heritage, expressed partly by the medieval architecture that Germans (known in Romanian as ""Saxons"", though in fact they came from far and wide across the German-speaking world) brought to Transylvania and preserved for centuries against staggering odds. Second, the Germans are withdrawing from the mess that is today's Romania. This means the villages and small towns, which have been a mainstay of Transylvania's rural economy, are themselves falling into ever deeper penury and degradation. 
Some 250,000-strong in 1939, a good tenth of the Germans who survived the second world war were carted off-once the communists took over-to Russian labour camps: almost none returned. Around 180,000 Germans sat tight until the mid-1970s, when Nicolae Ceausescu, Romania's communist dictator, began to let a steady trickle go-at a hefty price in D-marks. Communism's fall in 1989 prompted a huge outward spurt. From 110,000, the number of Germans plummeted to 41,000 in less than two years. Now the figure has shrivelled again-to less than 17,000. The Saxon heritage could vanish. 
What is to be done? Take a little village like Viscri (which Germans still call Weisskirch)Once an almost entirely German hamlet of some 450 people, its population has stayed quite stable. But only 30-odd Germans are left-and the economy, based on farming in the lovely rolling plains around, barely exists. 
The squalor is striking. The village stands seven kilometres (four miles) from the nearest tarmac road. There is no longer a shop, bakery, clinic or garage. Rickety horse-drawn wagons far outnumber cars. There is no modern sewage system or running water. A filthy stream bubbles through the village's wide, rutted, muddy street. A telephone line was fixed up two years ago, but most of the skilled Germans (bakers, butchers, teachers, mechanics) who once kept things ticking over have gone. Fields of hops, once the village's main earner, have been abandoned. Gypsies-the butt of discrimination throughout Romania, and usually ill-educated people with scant farming skills-now count for more than half the population. Ethnic Romanians and a handful of Hungarians make up most of the rest. 
Viscri's glory is its stunning white medieval church (which gives the place its name) within a high-walled 12th-century citadel which-like 100 or so other such German fortifications in Transylvaniafended off Turks and Tatars as well as occasionally warring locals. The village's dynamic mayor, Caroline Femolend, an ethnic German, is trying to prod wellwishers outside Romania, including in the World Bank, to dip into their pockets. Otherwise, the village simply cannot survive-in human or architectural terms.  1999 DOUBLE tragedy continues to unfold in Transylvania, the northwestern chunk of Romania that has been a haven for ethnic Germans for some eight centuries.

Each year the auditors discover all manner of horrors in the accounts. Each year the parliament rubber-stamps them just the same. 
Hence the astonishment when on December 17th the parliament, angered by some ill-conceived prodding from the commission, voted to reject the accounts for 1996. The Socialists who dominate the chamber are arguing now for a vote of censure which, if carried, will oblige the entire commission to resign. 
Probably this vote will fail, as others have done before. But it is the first one to count as something more than a hopelessly empty threat. The parliament is growing in stature, thanks mainly to the powers given and promised it by the Maastricht and Amsterdam treaties. These include the power to approve (or not) the appointment of a new commission, and a de facto veto over the choice of president. And, decidedly, the parliament does not like Jacques Santer, the incumbent. The budget fiasco has probably been enough to end any hopes he might have had for reappointment when his term expires at the end of 1999. 
Not that Eu heads of government were likely to make Mr Santer, a former prime minister of Luxembourg, their first choice anyway. They want someone both tougher and (ideally) more taciturn. They will try to choose someone by June, when they meet for a summit in Cologne. The frontrunner is probably still Romano Prodi, a former Italian prime minister. Felipe Gonzalez, a former Spanish one, was once much-fancied but now looks over-embroiled in controversies back home. A more plausible Spanish contender might be Javier Solana, whose term as NATO'S secretary-general ends in 1999. 
A flurry of gossip in the autumn suggested that Germany might propose its finance minister, Oskar Lafontaine. This ranks as an improbable but thought-provoking idea. The first German to head the commission, Walter Hallstein, retired in 1967. A second German presidency is long overdue. If not Mr Lafontaine, another German could carry the day. 
One early piece of horse-trading already seems to have taken place. A Frenchman, Jean Lemierre, is about to be confirmed as the new president of the EU'S Economic and Financial Committee. This group of top officials from central banks, national treasuries and the European Commission, previously known as the ""monetary committee"", is one of the most powerful behind-thescenes bodies in the Union. Until recently, an Italian, Mario Draghi, was favourite to take over its presidency. Mr Lemierre's upset victory suggests a quid pro quo for Italy, in the form of an understanding that France will not oppose Mr Prodi's candidacy for the commission's presidency. 
But whoever takes over at the commission will have to gird himself (no she is in sight) for a tricky few years. It is an increasingly awkward outfit to run; power is drifting away from it. One practical inconvenience is a top-heavy structure brought about by the EU'S growth from six to 15 members. This already means an unwieldy ""college"" of 20 commissioners jostling for portfolios. A dozen more countries want to join the EU in the next few years. 
Any worthwhile reform will probably mean creating a hierarchy with a few ""super-commissioners"" on top and the rest as deputies or department heads beneath them. But how does one sell that idea to the countries that fail to get a super-commissioner of their own? How does one arrange for the top tier to be chosen on merit, and not by a lottery or quota system? Such internal issues will dog and may even consume the next presidential term. 
The next president will also find other institutions eroding the commission's power and influence. The parliament is one. National governments are another: politicians have mastered the possibilities of European integration to the point at which they, and not the commission, have become the real agenda-setters. Mr Lafontaine has shown as much in the case of tax harmonisation. The launch of the euro has also changed the balance of power profoundly. The Union's economic centre has become the new European Central Bank, which owes the commission no obedience whatsoever. 
The commission is about to be left on the margins of another new project: the development of a common foreign and security policy. The main role here will be played by a new ""high representative"", likely also to be named at the Cologne summit. (Delays on the part of France and others in ratifying the Amsterdam treaty, which provides the legal basis for an Eu foreign-policy apparatus, prevented a high representative from being chosen at the Vienna summit in December.) 
The new high representative will be accountable not to the commission, but to national governments grouped together in the Eu's Council of Ministers. Dick Spring, a former Irish foreign minister, is one plausible candidate. So too is Carlos Westendorp, a Spaniard who has been representing the West in Bosnia. 
It sounds an attractive job. When the world wants to know what ""Europe"" thinks about the latest crisis, the high rep will pop up on television to explain. If the European Parliament has its way, he will be the Union's champion of human rights. One day he may even have some real muscle at his disposal, if governments agree to give the Union more of a say in Europe's defence. 
Contrast that with the lot of Mr Santer's successor, who will have parliament breathing down his neck, the central bank refusing to catch his eye, and the foreign-policy figure treading all over his toes. As the heads of government deliberate over which grandee might be juggled into the commission, anyone whose name is being tossed into the air would be wise to wonder whether that prize is really the one worth having.  1999 Tony Blair insists that there is no comparison between the rows that forced Peter Mandelson and Geoffrey Robinson to resign and the ""sleaze"" scandals that bedevilled the Major government. Is he right? 
FROM the moment that Peter Mandelson resigned from his job as trade and industry secretary on December 23rd, the Labour government has been engaged in a frenzied exercise in damage limitation. The Mandelsonian misjudgment was to accept a 373,ooo ($630,ooo) loan from Geoffrey Robinson, a rich colleague, and then to keep it secret-even when his department was investigating Mr Robinson's business affairs. According to the Blairites, this is quite, quite different from the sleaze that engulfed the Tories. 
Does Labour protest too much? The various scandals that have so far beset Labour combine many of the elements that damaged the Tories (see box) But Labour argue that Tory scandals contained an extra ingredient-outright corruption. The most famous of these was the ""cash-for-questions"" scandal, in which some Tory Mps accepted money in return for asking questions in Parliament. This was certainly blatant misconduct, but Mr Mandelson's sin, too, was a huge conflict of interest. And Mr Mandelson is a much more central figure in the Labour government than any of the Tories caught up in the cash-for-questions affair-who had heard of Tim Smith, or Sir Michael Grylls or Neil Hamilton (who still denies the charges)? 
The sheer quantity of Tory scandal was also impressive. Twelve ministers were forced to resign over various misdeeds; and there were numerous indiscretions from backbench MPs, ranging from affairs with night-club hostesses to dubious business dealings. But even here Labour is doing its best. In the five years of the Major government, two cabinet ministers were forced to resign-the Blair administration has equalled that in a year and a half 
SEX Of the 12 ministerial resignations under the Major government, five were related to sexual behaviour. David Mellor (right) was the first of two cabinet ministers to go. Although the allegations that finally finished him off related to his acceptance of ""foreign hospitality"", it was lurid headlines about an affair (toe-sucking with an actress) that first put him on the ropes. A rash of other stories about Tories with mistresses or strange sexual tastes was especially damaging since Mr Major had championed traditional morality. Tony Blair's first cabinet casualty, Ron Davies (left), who resigned as Welsh secretary in October, was also brought down by sex. He was mugged after apparently cruising for gay sex in a London park. In the subsequent row two other cabinet ministers including Peter Mandelson were revealed to be homosexual. 
COVER-UP The other cabinet minister to resign during the Major years was Jonathan Aitken (right) He resigned to sue the Guardian newspaper after it alleged that he had allowed Saudi businessmen to pay for him to stay at the Ritz Hotel in Paris, whilst he was minister for defence procurement. Mr Aitken lost his libel action and now faces charges of perjury: Mr Mandelson's conflict of interest was initially much less obvious; he accepted a loan from Geoffrey Robinson when both men were still in opposition. It was only when his department began to investigate Mr Robinson's business affairs that trouble loomed. But while Mr Mandelson may not have lied, he did dissemble. He failed to tell the senior civil servant at the Department of Trade and Industry of his obligation to Mr Robinson; he fobbed off journalists who asked him how he could afford to buy his house; and he seems to have failed to tell the Britannia Building Society, from which he obtained a mortgage, about the loan from Mr Robinson. 
AND INFLUENCE PEDDLING Much of the aura of sleaze that surrounded the Tory party arose from its habit of accepting large, often secret, donations from dubious characters and foreigners. Asil Nadir (right), a businessman who subsequently fled Britain to avoid prosecution, donated f440,000 to the Tories; and the family of Ma Sikchun, who fled Hong Kong to avoid drug-running charges, also stumped up f im. But neither of these men bought immunity; Mr Nadir is still a fugitive and the Ma family accused the Tories of ""swindling"" them because charges against the senior Ma were not dropped. Labour's biggest funding scandal has centred on a respectable businessmanBernie Ecclestone (left), who runs Formula One motor racing. Unlike Messrs Ma and Nadir, Mr Ecclestone arguably got something for his Im donation. Shortly after the election the Blair government deferred plans to ban tobacco-advertising in motor racing.  1999 The economy 
Why are British interest rates so much higher than Europe's and America's? 
THREE cuts in interest rates, totalling 1.25 percentage points, brought some cheer to British borrowers in the last three months of 1998. But not all that much. Britain's official interest rates, at 6.25%, remain the highest of any large rich country (see chart on next page). America's Federal Funds rate is 4.75% and the eleven European countries adopting the euro will share a common official rate of a mere 3%. 
Yet Britain begins 1999 with the weakest economy in this group, except Japan's, according to the panel of forecasters polled monthly by The Economist. Indeed, a growing number of economists expect a recession. So why are British interest rates so much higher than those in America and euroland? The simplest answer is that the goal of central bankers is to achieve price stability, and that despite the relative weakness of the economy the Bank of England is still more worried than monetary authorities in other countries about inflation. 
The Bank's monetary-policy committee (MPC), which sets interest rates, has the explicit task of keeping ""RPIX"" inflation (ie, excluding mortgage-interest payments) at 2.5%. Throughout 1998, it fretted that Britain's labour market was tight. There is also the risk that sharper cuts in interest rates would weaken sterling, raising the inflation rate through higher import prices. The pound's 9% drop against the D-mark from its peak in March in effect eased monetary policy a little-the reverse of the role played before then by an appreciating pound. 
Indeed, inflation in Britain has remained higher than elsewhere. It is certainly remarkably low by the country's past standards, the more so after a long economic expansion. Currently RPIX inflation is 2.5%, on target. But American inflation, despite seven years of strong economic growth, is only 1.5%. In Germany, inflation is o.7% and in France a mere o.3%. 
International differences in current inflation rates, however, explain less than you might think. Even by the standards of economic data, they are imprecise, thanks to differences in the measurement of inflation. America's inflation rate has been trimmed by statistical refinements in recent years far more than has Britain's. And on the Eu-wide harmonised index of consumer prices, the gap between British inflation and those of France and Germany is smaller than on national measures. The British rate is 1.4%, compared with 0.2% in France, o.6% in Germany and an average of o.9% in the euro-11. 
More important, however, current inflation rates matter far less to monetarypolicy makers than does expected inflation. The MPC, for example, sets rates with an eye to hitting its target two years ahead. So the nz PC must believe that deeper cuts in interest rates would have risked pushing inflation above target in two years' time. 
There is, however, another possible reason why the Bank has not gone further in cutting rates: inertia. Financial markets see few inflationary dangers in Britain: tenyear government-bond yields are within a point of France's and Germany's, and below America's. In effect, the Mpc has already revised its expectation of inflation, and reduced rates accordingly, three times in the past three months. Most economists expect more revisions in the months ahead. 
In a recent lecture Charles Goodhart, a member of the MPC, argued that central banks were slow to react to changes in economic events, preferring to cut rates in small steps. They were also, he said, sometimes loth to move rates for fear of having to change their minds later. Yet in 1998 America's Federal Reserve cut rates as the global economic weather darkened, even though the domestic economy was still growing healthily. Europe's central bankers surprised the markets by cutting rates last month. Either or both may turn out to have been too eager. Should Britain's central bankers also have been bolder? 
Perhaps; and they might yet be. Most economists expect more rate cuts soon (even if not at the MPC'S next meeting on January 6th-7th). And there is an intriguing discussion in the minutes of last month's gathering, published on December 23rd. Some committee members thought it ""useful"" to consider a ""neutral"" interest rate, which would neither slow the economy nor expand it. Such a rate, they suggested, could lie anywhere between 4.5% and 6.5%-ie, the sum of expected inflation of about 2.5% and a real interest rate of between 2% and 4%. 
Others on the committee think the idea bunk, or at any rate too imprecise to be much use. How should the neutral rate vary with the exchange rate, say? Nonetheless it is noteworthy that British rates are still near the top of this ""neutral"" range with the economy on the edge of recession. Time to draw closer to both Europe and America?  1999 John Prescott needs to sharpen the financial incentives of Britain's privatised rail companies to stop passengers being taken for a ride 
THE ultimatum given to passenger-railway operators to improve their services or face the loss or curtailment of their franchises expires next month. Despite such threats made by the deputy prime minister, John Prescott, there are few signs of improvement. 
Extensive engineering works by Railtrack made travel over the Christmas and new year holiday period a nightmare. With punctuality declining and overcrowding worsening, passenger complaints continue to rise. 
All this poses a problem for Mr Prescott. He began a recent meeting with train operators by pointing out that for the past 18 months he had been able to blame the Tories. The next scapegoats were the train companies, good for perhaps another six months. But after that, he bellowed, ""the shit falls on me."" 
The deputy prime ministers dilemma can be summed up briefly. Does he return to a centrally run railway by imposing much tougher regulation on Railtrack and the train-operating companies? Or is he prepared to allow high profits in return for high levels of investment? The rail structure he inherited means that this choice cannot be delayed much longer. The appointment of the chairman of a new strategic railway authority, to be announced later this month, may provide a clue. Among those shortlisted is Sir Alastair Morton, whose record as Eurotunnel co-chairman shows that he can both knock heads and oversee high-risk operations. 
The Conservatives privatised the railways hurriedly and on the cheap. Though there was nominally a quality threshold, the successful train operators were those submitting the lowest bids for subsidy. As a result, Treasury support for the railways by 2oo4 will be about half the level prior to privatisation. That imposes a squeeze which requires rapid growth in passenger revenues as well as stringent cost cutting. The consequence has been overcrowding and declining punctuality. The task of delivering a satisfactory service is complicated by the split between track and train operations with both sides blaming one another for poor performance. 
The train operators claim that privatising the rail network as a monopoly has given disproportionate power to Railtrack. Shareholders' interests, they complain, have taken precedence over levels of investment, noting that the company's share price has quadrupled since privatisation. 
Railtrack, for its part, points out that it has improved its punctuality and reliability by 45% over the past four years while that of the train operators has deteriorated. Its chief executive, Gerald Corbett, argues persuasively that blame for poor performance is at least in part due to the misalignment of financial incentives. Railtrack, he points out, gains only marginally from increased fare revenues, thus minimising its incentive to invest. The train operators, on the other hand, have benefited so much from passenger growth that financial penalties for poor running have become insignificant. 
The first serious shot in this war was fired by the acting rail regulator, Chris Bolt, last month. Supporting complaints that Railtrack was investing insufficiently to justify its current high rates of return, he threatened to cap the fees it charges train operators for the use of its track. Railtrack immediately retaliated, saying that, if its profits were capped, this would have an immediate impact on its ability to raise capital. ""The key is getting new equity,"" says Mr Corbett. ""Our share price should be regarded as an asset rather than a problem."" 
Railtrack has some strong cards to play in what will be a lengthy negotiation. It has a key role in building the Channel Tunnel fast rail link and it is also a leading contender to take over the infrastructure contract for London Underground. ""Railtrack is Prescott's white knight,"" commented an industry observer. ""He knows he won't get any money out of the Treasury."" 
The government, however, cannot afford to allow a privatised monopoly a soft ride. With passenger numbers growing at around 6% a year to nearly 85om, the need to accelerate investment in track and rolling stock is urgent. Many commuter and peak-hour inter-city routes are now so crowded that passengers are having to stand for long periods, blocking any movement along the train. 
Railtrack says there are at least 30 serious congestion points in the network. This squeeze on capacity explains why punctuality and overcrowding are getting worse. But so far the company has been reluctant to commit itself to dealing with these bottlenecks, blaming the lack of incentives in its regulatory regime. 
In part, current problems are the problems of success. Train operators are running 1,ooo extra services a day while the number of passenger journeys has increased by nearly 100m in the past two years. Railtrack and the train operators are winning back custom from the roads. The question is: will they continue to do so, or will their squabbling bring Britain's rail revival to a screeching halt?  1999 MANY a marriage has come to grief even before the wedding day, as the happy couple and their families squabble over who to invite to the ceremony and the reception; over who will sit where; and over the choice and the cost of dresses, flowers, limousines, food, drinks and photographers. No wonder that increasing numbers of couples choose to get hitched in an exotic place far, far away from their relatives. 
No official figures are kept on the numbers marrying abroad. But Mintel, a market-research firm, estimates that in 1997 around 17,ooo couples went abroad to tie the knot. If so, that is one in 20 of all marriages of British residents. 
Exotic wedding-cum-honeymoon trips have become big earners for the travel trade: the Association of British Travel Agents' website lists 54 firms which claim expertise in arranging weddings abroad. Marrying at a Caribbean beach-side hotel is the most popular choice, though the weddings brochure of Airtours, Britain's second-largest tour operator, also offers the chance to exchange vows on a Canadian ski slope or in an underground cavern in Barbados. 
Whereas a traditional wedding back home typically costs at least L100,000 ($16,900) an exotic wedding abroad can be had for a supplement of a few hundred pounds on top of the cost of the honeymoon package tour. Often, the travel firm throws in many of the usual trimmings, such as a wedding cake and a bottle of bubbly, as well as some unusual ones: couples booking Airtours' wedding package in Jamaica get a massage and a ""commemorative T-shirt""; those choosing to wed at Disney World in Florida get their marriage certificate signed by Mickey and Minnie Mouse. 
To Richard Lampard, a sociologist at Warwick University who studies marriage, it is all part of a trend over several decades in which marriage has ceased to be a ""public institution"" and is now seen as simply a private contract between two people. The wedding ceremony itself is no longer regarded as the ""property"" of the local community in whose midst it is carried out. Increasingly, couples are marrying in their late twenties and paying for the wedding themselves, which means they are more likely to withstand family pressure to do things the traditional way-or to invite Auntie Maude.  1999 IT IS hard to sum up pithily the complex mixture of emotions generated by the dramatic Christmas resignation of Peter Mandelson, one of the chief architects of New Labour, secretary of state for trade and industry, and probably the most interesting (""exotic"" is his own word) man in Tony Blair's cabinet. It is hard, but it is not impossible. Bagehot's impression is that the reaction of many people-and certainly of most of political London-to the rude interruption of this gifted man's sparkling career can be broadly summarised as hahahahah. 
There is seldom a good reason to find pleasure in the misfortune of others. But there can be better reasons and worse reasons. In the case of Mr Mandelson's secret L373,000 ($630,000) loan from Geoffrey Robinson, the paymaster general, people need to sort out exactly what it is that they find so funny. The list is not comprehensive, but here, in descending order of acceptability, are four different flavours of hahahahah. 
It would be consoling to think that the most prevalent sort of hahahahah was the most highminded one, the one that says: ""This is a man who behaved dishonourably and was caught out."" Surely nobody can believe that anything other than self-preservation prevented Mr Blair's most intimate counsellor from telling the prime minister about his vast personal debt to Mr Robinson, once the paymaster general had become the subject of an investigation by Mr Mandelson's own department? Well, the peculiar thing is that some people-Mr Blair included-say not only that they believe him but have chosen to shower him with praise for having reluctantly resigned. And the depressing thing is that most of the people who do not believe him seem to be saying hahahahah for a different reason. 
This second sort of hahahahah has something to do with Greek tragedy. It is a not especially admirable human reaction to a tale of human frailty. Every so often it becomes the fate of a politician to prove all over again the adage that pride comes before a fall. Mr Mandelson was the perfect candidate. If, still knowing nothing about the secret loan he took from Mr Robinson, you had been asked in some pre-Christmas quiz to nominate a prominent member of the present government as a great man ripe for laying low, you would probably have selected Mr Mandelson. Famous for the exquisite sensitivity of his political antennae, he nonetheless made the elementary mistake of letting it be known that he considered himself very great indeed. Here was a man who made friends with Elisabeth Murdoch and Prince Charles but also made the nursing of grievances, the intimidation of journalists and the snubbing of the lowly into something akin to an art form. It is hardly high-minded, but perhaps not so terrible-and (be generous to yourself) maybe even healthy for democracy-to feel, instinctively: ""Hahahahah. He puffed himself up and was overdue for a comeuppance."" 
The third flavour of hahahahah holds some danger for British politics. This is the one that says: ""We knew all along that nothing good would come of this New Labour malarkey."""" Tories say this because Labour mounted a high horse and exaggerated the sleaze of John Major's government. But many traditional Labour people are saying it too, because they dislike many of the aspects of New Labour that Mr Mandelson came to symbolise. How delicious, they say, and how apt, that Mr Mandelson's fatal flaw was a craving to live beyond his means in a posh house at a fashionable address in London. This was the smart cosmopolitan who folded up the red flag and put a red rose in its place, who saw nothing wrong in people becoming ""filthy rich"", and who poked fun last summer at the idea that Labour owed a special debt to ""horny-handed, dirty-overalled people"". Well, just as Mr Mandelson did himself no good by putting himself in hock to the (filthy-rich) Mr Robinson, sohahahahah-no good will come from New Labour continuing to snub the trade unions and cosy up to big business. 
But this reaction has a fatal flaw of its own. It is at the very least based on a non-sequitur. In the matter of his house and loan, Mr Mandelson undoubtedly made a serious mistake. The man may be discredited, his style may be objectionable. But the policies with which he became associated-an end to class war, support for competition and flexible labour markets-have not been discredited at all. On the contrary. New Labour would not have won the last election if it had not ditched the discredited Old Labour ideas which those who rejoice in the exit of Mr Mandelson now see a chance to promote all over again. There are few such people within the government itself, but there are some. In his first interview after Mr Mandelson's resignation, Mr Blair made a point of warning potential revisionists that New Labour was bigger than any individual, and would resist any return to old policies. 
The Tories would love Labour to reopen these battles. One Tory spokesman claimed reports of a new alliance of pro-spending Keynesians between John Prescott, the deputy prime minister, and Gordon Brown, the chancellor, as evidence of the return of ideology to what had so far just been ""intense personal loathing"" between Mr Brown and Mr Blair. But this is wishful thinking on the Tories' part. Both Mr Brown and Mr Prescott see themselves as signed-up members of New Labour. Pardon the understatement, but they just don't like Mr Mandelson. 
And that, by the way, is the fourth flavour of hahahahah. It is the reaction of a handful of ministers and their spin doctors who continue to snipe at one another for no better reason than personal rivalry, and who say: ""Hahahahah, our enemy has fallen."" It is the unfunniest hahahahah of all.  1999 Northem Italy is studded with thriving clusters of manufacturing businesses. Why are they so vigorous? 
BEAUTIFULLY made goods from northern Italy are a part of la dolce vita from Hollywood to Hong Kong. Silk from Como, wool from Biella and gold from Vicenza adorn the fashionable, while on their noses perch glasses shaped and polished in the Dolomites. Ferrari, Ducati and Alfa Romeo are northern Italian names to quicken a motorist's heart. Tiles from Modena grace the grandest kitchens, and in those kitchens the famous cheese of Parma is grated on pasta prepared in the city's factories. 
These glamorous consumer industries are sustained by a second, less visible layer of activity. It consists of the firms that make the machines that make the famous products. Italy's group of machine-tool manufacturers, the bottom layer of the manufacturing pyramid, is the fourth-largest in the world after Japan's, Germany's and America's, with sales of $3.45 billion in 1997. Individual Italian machine makers tend to be small. The average size of the workforce in Italy's 450 machine-tool firms is 70, compared with 200 in Germany's 320 firms. According to Mario Fochi, of Sperotto Rimar, which makes textile-finishing machines, machinery makers spring up around the manufacturing firms like mushrooms amid the roots of big trees. 
Such delicacies are much sought-after among business theorists these days. Excited by the crackling commercial energy of Silicon Valley in California, governments around the world have tried to create their own Silicon Glens, Fens and Parks, Bio Valleys and Villes. They offer cheap buildings, infrastructure and tax breaks as a lure to entrepreneurs. The aim is to boost the productivity and creativity of everyone in the cluster by fostering opportunities for collaboration and the exchange of information, and a critical mass of expertise. 
Something in the air 
Northern Italy's long-standing clusters are proof of the value of collaboration. Elena Ferraro of IECO, which makes machines for melting and electroforming gold, underlines the importance of exchanging information with her customers. Of the firm's sales, 60% are within Italy. Most of those are of customised machines, rather than the off-the-shelf models and complete turn-key factories that IECO sells abroad. The need to keep up with the demands of the more sophisticated Italian goldsmiths has enabled Italian suppliers such as IECO, and nearby Sisma, to dominate their business, supplying about 80% of the total world market for machinery for making gold jewellery. 
Yet northern Italian clusters also contain a more surprising ingredient: the collaborators increasingly compete as well. Easier communications and trade mean that both manufacturers and machinery suppliers can more easily deal with each other's rivals across the world. 
The great fear among Italian industrialists is that this will weaken the country's clusters. Rather than use machines that might be sold to their competitors, some bigger firms prefer to rely on equipment from in-house workshops. Barilla, the world's largest pasta maker, has a 100strong engineering division. Proprietary machines propel every stage of its new lasagne line in Parma, from the floppy curtains of fresh dough dropping on to conveyors to the dealer that stacks the cut, dried sheets like so many playing cards. More important is the computer system the company has designed to control the line. Necessity has been the mother of some of this invention, for Barilla's dominance of its home market-it has 32%, compared with 4.8% for its nearest rival-means it operates on a larger scale than others, giving it needs that cannot be met with standard equipment. 
Other large firms are all too aware that their secrets would be at risk if the machines they use were widely available. Safilo, the second-biggest manufacturer of spectacles in the Veneto, with a turnover of 566 billion lire ($345m) in 1997, also has a research division. Fifty engineers design and build the machines that are humming away in the factory next door. Some of the systems developed within Safilo's workshop are patented-machinery to construct a particularly flexible hinge, for example. More often, the engineers modify standard machines that Safilo buys from outside. Vittorio Tabacchi, the chairman, laughs at the idea of asking the company's suppliers to modify the machines they sell him: that would reveal his firm's secrets and allow them to fall into the hands of competitors. 
Smaller firms do not have the luxury of using machines that are not sold to foreign competitors. Sperotto Rimar, Mr Fochi's firm, sprouted originally because of the sustaining presence in the region of Marzotto and Lanerossi, two textile firms that some 150 years ago found in the steep hills north of Vicenza fast-flowing streams to drive their looms, and sheep to provide wool. 
Today these two firms are one, which gets its wool from Australia and its power from the national grid, and its boss chafes at the restrictions a narrow valley places on floor space in his factory. The machinery in that factory comes from suppliers in other countries as well as its neighbourslooms from Switzerland, bobbin-winders from Germany, washing machines from Britain. Equally, 9o% of Mr Fochi's steam presses and shrinking machines go abroad-up from 6o% in 1985. Many go to Marzotto's growing number of rivals in Asia. Nuovo Pignone, a nearby loom maker that also supplies Marzotto, sold 7o% of its output in 1997 in Asia (and itself is being bought by a Swiss competitors 
Yet the increasing foreign trade also provides things that are good for clusters. Sisma, the world's largest producer of machines used to make gold chains, received 80% of its 30 billion lire ($18m) turnover from exports in 1997. ""Some Italian jewellery firms are unhappy that we sell machinery to their foreign competitors. But if we didn't, others would,"" reasons Fiorenzo Sbabo, Sisma's chairman. 
In this way, international sales prevent would-be foreign competitors from emerging. At the same time, the threat is a stimulus for innovation and the desire to move constantly upmarket. Italy has an edge in quality even in industries where other countries have obvious advantages. Its tile industry is one example (see box). Another is cashmere, which comes from China. Firms there have installed numerous Italian looms, as well as developing equipment of their own, but the finest cashmere clothes still come from Biella. The gap is narrowing, but Italy remains ahead. 
Similarly, South-East Asia dominates the mass market for spectacles, but Italy retains a lock on the top end of the market (where the profit margins are much greater: cheap glasses cost $4 to make and may sell for $15; designer glasses cost $12 and sell for $150). In gold jewellery, leather and tiles, likewise, Italy has hung on to the most lucrative part of the market, even as others have conquered its lower end. 
New technology has permitted the intimacy that used to be possible only within a cluster to take place over long distances. As a result, foreign customers have become a source of feedback in their own right. Flavio Radice, the boss of Pietro Carnaghi, a tool maker in Busto Arsizio, north of Milan, says he and his designers regularly use their video-telephone link to pore over plans with customers for the huge vertical-milling machines his firm makes for turbine builders. Some of these customers are to be found just up the road, part of the dense engineering conglomeration of this most industrious of towns, but others, such as Boeing Aerospace, for which Pietro Carnaghi has built a machine to shape the top of Delta-4 rockets, are in America. 
Nonetheless, there is an advantage in being local. Mr Radice's firm has built a suite of offices complete with a shower alongside its workshop. Customers like to come and spend several weeks consulting with the firm's engineers as their machines take shape. Being there still matters.  1999 TORTELLINI and Lambrusco pushed aside the usual machines and cutting oil last November when LB Officine Meccaniche celebrated 25 years of building machinery for making ceramic tiles at its factory on the outskirts of Sassuolo. There was every excuse for a blow-out: the firm's fortunes have risen with those of the Italian tile industry, which produced 572m square metres in 1997, compared with only 200m square metres in 1973. Over the same period exports have risen too, from 30% to 70% of total production. By egging each other on, both the tile makers and the machinery makers such as LB Officine Meccaniche that cluster together in Sassuo(o's ""tile valley"" have given themselves much to celebrate. 
Success has depended on innovation. LB Officine Meccaniche, for example, has developed systems for handling and mixing materials to make porcelain tiles that look like marble and granite, but are lighter and cheaper than the real thing. Tile makers elsewhere are catching up with the Italians. Ten years ago Spain's production was only one half that of Italy; now it is almost as large. Turkey's production is growing rapidly, and China's is already as large as Italy's. To stay ahead, the Italians must continue to innovatethe pressing concerns today are to reduce fragility and to make elaborate shapes in large quantities-in order to add more value to what is at bottom nothing more than cooked mud. 
Whether Italian tile makers can keep innovating is another matter. After the party, the strains of cluster life soon resurface. Angelo Bore]li, chairman of Assopiastrelle, the tile makers' trade association, says that his members and the machinery makers have a love-hate relationship. He complains that machinery makers sell foreign clients expertise that they acquired through their work in Italy. ""[We] would be much better off if the machines were not sold abroad,"" he grumbles. 
Nearly three-quarters of the machinery makers' 1997 turnover came from exports, with almost one-third going to Asia. But tile makers are getting their own back: problems in Asia have brought harder times for the machinery makers and, according to Filippo Marazzi, chairman of the Marazzi Group, Italy's top tile maker, a chance for their customers to buy cheaply by playing off suppliers against each other. 
Ivanno Ligabue, one of the founders of LB Officine Meccaniche, is uneasy for the region's future. He doubts that tile makers are doing enough to create new products and market them. But out of such insecurity the next wave of innovation is born.  1999 WITH a record like his, there is every reason to think that Lord Simpson, the managing director of Britain's General Electric Company(GEc, will play a big role in the reshaping of Europe's defence industry. Not that he entertains many grand designs himself he wants to pair off his Marconi defence arm with one of four potential partners, two of them in Europe, and two in America. 
When Lord Simpson was boss of Rover, the last big car company in British hands was clinging to life with the help of Japan's Honda, which owned a zoo% stake in the ailing but venerable firm. With a refreshing lack of sentimentality, he sold it to a German firm, BMW, before going on to run Lucas, a British car-parts company. Ere long that too went-to America's Varity. 
True to form, just before Christmas, Lord Simpson confirmed, in effect, that he was proceeding with the dismemberment of GEC, another British industrial institution, which had been built lovingly over 30 years by Lord Weinstock, who was one of the country's most respected industrialists. Lord Simpson had already floated the group's power-engineering joint venture, Alstom. His next move will be to split the civil and military sides of Marconi, its electronics and communications subsidiary, the better to sell or merge Marconi's main defence business. 
At the last count, Lockheed Martin and Northrop Grumman in America, and British Aerospace (sae) and Thomson-csF (French despite the name), were all in discussion with GEC The company confirmed just before the end of 1998 that a deal should be announced in January. 
Lord Simpson is lucky to be in a sellers market. Americans are interested because GEC is respected as a supplier to the Pentagon, and recently snapped up a smallish American company, Tracor, to strengthen its American business. Meanwhile, the European defence industry is poised for rationalisation, so that it can compete better with American giants such as Boeing and Lockheed Martin. Closest to tying the knot are sAe and DASA, the aerospace part of DaimlerChrysler. 
In many ways Lord Simpson might find a merger with Lockheed easiest, building on GEC'S good reputation in America. Or he could seek to become the third leg in the sae/DAsA group, but this would probably have to wait some time until the first two arranged their own deal and worked out a way for GEC to join without turning DASA into the junior partner. A third option would be to join Thomson, which the French government wants to strengthen and privatise. A Marconi-Thomson link-up would create a new powerful defence-electronics company every bit as prestigious as the sAe/DAsA group (which makes the aeroplane platforms that carry the military electronics). 
Whichever Lord Simpson chooses, he will be left with the rump of the industrial and consumer businesses of GEc-which includes such things as weighing machines, telecoms equipment, domestic appliances and medical devices. He would be unlikely to use them as a base for building a GEC Mark Two. So expect rather more disposals and handing back of cash to shareholders. Would the last person to leave GEC please turn out the lights.  1999 South Korean restructuring 
EVEN those who are leery of politicians meddling in industry sense a certain justice in the dressing down that South Korea's government is giving its giant conglomerates, or chaebol. Kim Dae Jung, South Korea's president, is not alone when he blames the chaebol's huge debts and overweening expansion for his country's eceonomic crisis. Yet, however much the chaebol need reining in, President Kim's row with the LG Group appears to be a miscalculation. On December 28th the government cancelled new loans to LG. If it were to go further and call in debts worth $5.6 billion, as it has threatened, it would destroy the firm. And to what end? 
The fight is over the government's plan for LG to merge its semiconductor operations with those of Hyundai. There is an arbitrary, almost numerological, dimension to this-as there is to Mr Kim's other industrial designs. Instead of three main chaebol in most big industries, the government wants two, with the weakest handing its operations to one of the stronger two. 
Ultimately, Mr Kim's aim is to lower the chaebol's soaring debts and to reduce overcapacity. The top five chaebol have already agreed to lower their average ratio of debt to equity to 200% by the end of 1999, from nearly 400% today. Not content for the chaebol to do this in their own fashion, the government is directing the restructuring with enforced swaps, which have come to be known as ""big deals"". With LG refusing to do Mr Kim's bidding, the president is using the state-controlled banking system to starve the chaebol of money. 
Sometimes, as with Samsung's car plant, born ofthe company's mis-timed entry into the car industry in 1998, the rationale for restructuring seems justified, even if the method is heavy-handed. (Samsung agreed to hand the plant to Daewoo in exchange for some second-rate consumerelectronics operations.) But the deal between LG and Hyundai does not even have the advantage of industrial logic 
The argument for the merger rests on the current overcapacity in memory-chip making-the plunging price of which in 6 caused the losses that first harmed the chaebol. Memory-chip making is a cyclical industry. Those that can afford to invest in new technology through the down cycles stand to make huge profits when prices rise. To prosper, therefore, all three South Korean chipmakers (including Samsung, the leader) need to invest huge amounts in 1999 (see chart), which will mean borrowing billions of dollars just when they are supposed to be lowering their debt. The government thinks one big firm formed out of the two smallest (together, iG and Hyundai would be the world's largest memory-chip producer) would enjoy economies of scale. The government hopes that it may also attract a foreign investor, which could take up to a 50% stake and help finance the new investment. 
When the government first dreamed up this scheme in September, LG and Hyundai unenthusiastically agreed, hoping they could find a way to scotch it. But the government pressed on, proposing a 70-30 jointly owned firm, with Hyundai holding the controlling share. When LG demurred, the government asked Arthur D. Little to study the question. After the consultancy confirmed the governments view, LG threatened to sue it. 
Arthur D. Little argues that, because the memory industry is so capital intensive, only the richest firms can survive. ""Secondtier companies like LG and Hyundai are very vulnerable to downturns,"" the firm says; ""Put LG and Hyundai together and they become top-tier almost overnight."" 
In fact the deal makes little sense. It is anyone's guess whether a merger will really do much to make investment more affordable. Bigger, financially sound companies do have access to cheaper capital, which is indeed a competitive advantage in memory-chip making. Yet the combined company would still have far heavier debts than chipmakers elsewhere. The government may force the banks to forgive much of this debt (swapping it for equity, for instance), but it could just as easily do this for the two firms separately. In any case, neither LG nor Hyundai is a tiddler even now, with 12-13% ofthe world memory-chip market each-more than their Taiwanese rivals. 
There may be modest savings in research spending, but the two firms specialise in different types of memory chip. The combined firm would presumably continue to invest in both. Their factories also use different technologies that cannot easily be integrated. And, as ING Barings, an investment bank, points out, a firm the size of the combined LG-Hyundai may be less likely to attract a large foreign investor. Buying a half-share of such a giant would be too expensive for most of the firms that are likley to be interested (Intel, the obvious exception, has already joined Micron, an American memory maker). 
The pity is that South Korea already has rules that could sort out chip making and most other industries without Mr Kim's good offices. The government has banned the sort of loans between subsidiaries that LG and Hyundai used to help get through rough patches in the past. Under the new restrictions, the credit market could determine which operations should merge or close. Could it be that Mr Kim is unwilling to see the lay-offs that would result from such spontaneous restructuring?  1999 BY ADDING an inch to every Chinese shirt-tail, Britain hoped to keep its t9th-century textile mills running. It failed, but the promise of 1.2 billion consumers still lures traders to China. Most are disappointed: China is still largely rural and achingly poor-the average income is just $360 per head a year. 
Yet the rise of an urban economic elite, mobile telephones in hand, proves that there are two Chinas: the huge nation of poor peasants who may never buy a Coke, and a thin layer of free-spending officials, managers and entrepreneurs who are only too keen to splash out. Affluent China today probably amounts to a small nation, barely significant in the global consumer market-but growing too quickly to be ignored. 
It is easy to overestimate the buying power of China's elite consumers. Together they represent no more than 3om people in cities such as Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou and Shenzhen. And for the most part, they are not rich by world standards: according to the latest official government survey, the top lo% of city dwellers have an average annual disposable income of just $1,24o a person. 
On the other hand, if GDP per head is adjusted for purchasing power, the incomes of the top io% of city dwellers is probably closer to $io,ooo a year. The prevalence of wide-screen televisions, fancy stereos and home-karaoke machines in Shanghai apartments suggests that this new upper-middle class has more money than it admits to. Supposing that the real wealth of affluent Chinese lies somewhere between the two estimates, China's potential market must be somewhere between those of Belgium and Australia. 
Put like that, China looks hefty, but not gigantic. But compare China today with China in 1985 (the first year the country conducted comprehensive consumer surveys) and it is clear that China's growth has been rapid. 
Among urban households, fewer than one in five households had a colour television in 1985; today the average such home has more than one. Then, 7% had a refrigerator; now 73% do. Cameras are four times more common. Among richer urban households, more than a half now have a VCR or video CD machine, a pager, air-conditioner and shower, and nearly a third of homes also own a mobile telephone. Every year, millions more Chinese join the ranks of this high-spending elite. 
After three years of declining growth rates (from an unsustainable peak of 4o% a year in 1995), consumer spending started picking up again in 1998 and should come close to matching the country's 7.8% growth in GDP for the year. China is already one of the largest markets for mobile telephones and pagers, personal computers and antibiotics, and accounts for about one-third of global cigarette consumption. All of these industries make lots of money for foreign firms. In boom towns such as Shenzhen and Shanghai, BMWS and Mercedes are now commonplace: after decades of deprivation, the urge to splurge is strong.  1999 SLOVAKIA has not had much to boast of in recent years, but it may produce the biggest corporate default in Central Europe since the collapse of communism. Creditor banks have spent the past few weeks shuffling the management of vsz, Central Europe's largest steelworks, and trying to reach a deal to restructure its debts. The company defaulted in November on a $35m loan arranged by Merrill Lynch, and it is reckoned to have further debts of around $45om that it cannot service. If there is no progress within the coming months, it will go under. 
This mess need not have come about. vsz, which accounts for 8% of Slovak GDP and 14% of Slovak exports, enjoys strong local demand from the booming Central European car industry. Daewoo and Volkswagen, whose Czech Skoda subsidiary is vsz's largest customer, need a range of specialist steels which vsz could be supplying. Although vsz is being undercut in western markets by producers in Asia and the former Soviet Union, in Central Europe it has geography on its side. 
But politics has undermined vsz's business. The usual post-communist problems of overmanning and slack management were exacerbated in 1995 when the company was sold for a fifth of its market value to supporters of the thuggish Vladimir Meciar, who was ousted as prime minister in October 1998. The largest shareholder is now Alexander Rezes, who handed management control to his son in order to run Mr Meciar's re-election campaign. Jan Smerek, head of the supervisory board, is a member of parliament in Mr Meciar's leftwing populist party. He led attempts to put together another Meciar government. 
Instead of investing in vsz's run-down plant, Mr Rezes decided that it needed to diversify away from steel. He bought a heap of companies including a financial newspaper, a football club and some holiday homes in Spain. Fortunately, his attempts to buy Slovakia's largest insurer and thirdlargest bank came to nothing. 
vsz is nowa large political constituency as well as a huge chunk of the economy. It directly employs 25,ooo people, and supports three times that number through its supply chain. Sean Murphy, a steel analyst at Nomura, an investment bank, reckons that the company needs only a quarter of its present workforce. But, he says, ""the company is being run for the benefit of its employees, not its shareholders."" 
When the new government came to power in October, it offered to rescue vsz if the management and supervisory board resigned. They refused. But now that the company faces bankruptcy, they have accepted some changes. Just before Christmas the creditors kicked out Rezesfils and put in two American managers, including Thomas Graham, the ""smiling barracuda"" who has a record of turning around steel mills. What next? Simplest would be to sell the plant to a western firm with plenty of cash and no political agenda.  1999 SLOVAKIA has not had much to boast of in recent years, but it may produce the biggest corporate default in Central Europe since the collapse of communism.

Now it is proving to be its undoing 
BRITAIN'S textile industry is in a mess. Like many of the country's basic manufacturing industries, the textiles business is suffering from falling demand, volatile input prices and the strength of sterling. Much more startling is that a sweatshop industry should matter at all to Britain, one of the world's most developed economies. 
With a workforce of some 354,ooo, textiles and clothing is the sixth-largest employer in British manufacturing-just behind mechanical engineering. Britain and Italy are by far Europe's biggest employers in clothing manufacturing. Though many of its ii,ooo or so textile firms are small and family-run, Britain is also home to some of the publicly traded clothing manufacturers with the largest sales in Europe. 
All of them are having a miserable time. Share prices in the textiles sector have underperformed the -rsE 100 share index by some gn% in the past five years, let down by thinning margins and, in many cases, declining profits. In 1994 Coats Viyella, the largest, was one of the 1oo biggest quoted companies in Britain. On December 21st it suffered the indignity of being demoted from Britain's top 350 companies to its SmallCap Index. Today, the values of Britain's 3o-odd quoted textile firms combined would be less than half that needed to enter the ranking of the top too. 
And things are deteriorating. Clothing sales in Britain are flat and retailers fear that worse lies ahead. Britain's largest and most profitable retailer, Marks and Spencer, recently spoke of a ""bloodbath"" on the high streets. 
The plight of Britain's textile companies has much to do with nM&Ss. In most countries, clothing manufacturers are branded companies in their own right. Many have their own retail outlets-Benetton and Stefanel in Italy, Hugo Boss in Germany, Donna Karan and Tommy Hilfiger in America. In Britain, it is the clothing retailers-MeAS particularly-that enjoy brand status. Consumers shop for and trust in Mas clothes, whereas manufacturers remain faceless. To keep the British public loyal to its ""St Michael"" brand, Mas has tied its main suppliers to its apron strings, encouraging them to keep factories in Britain and to concentrate on supplying M&S. 
There was a time when both Mtas and its suppliers benefited. M&S'S ""Buy British"" policy not only protected local jobs; it also helped boost sales. With short lines of communication to suppliers, the retailer could keep a better check on quality and was more flexible. It could change ranges more quickly than rivals who imported, and was the first to bring innovative materials such as wrinkle-free fabric to the British public. 
Companies that became Me^S's preferred suppliers grew rapidly on the back of its success. Investors rated the big fourCoats Viyella, Courtaulds Textiles, Dewhirst and William Baird, which together supply 60% of nMs,s's clothing-more highly than the rest of the sector. 
Unfortunately, such dependence on one customer has left these companies vulnerable. Some 90% of Dewhirst's business is with M&s, while even William Baird, the least exposed, still sells more than 40% of its output to the retailer. Because the strong pound has made imports cheap, their domestic factories now carry hefty costs. For m&s, too, a British supply base has fewer advantages: quite apart from their higher costs, British suppliers have no particular advantage in servicing the retailer's growing number of overseas stores more efficiently. Faced with falling demand, M&s is suddenly asking its suppliers to shift production abroad. 
Although some are obediently doing so, M&S suppliers are still suffering. Worries that M&s may have too much stock have caused their shares to perform even worse than those of the rest of the British textile industry. In the past two months, M&S clothing suppliers have cut almost 2,300 British jobs. Even so, the industry in Britain may still have 30% too much capacity. 
Mergers could help to reduce capacity in the industry, but few have occurred. In September Courtaulds Textiles bought Claremont Garments for a paltry fom ($17m) plus debt-a mere 5% of Claremont's annual sales. William Baird is trying to persuade a reluctant Coats Viyella to sell its textiles and branded-clothes business for a probable om, including debt. 
Depressed share prices are one reason for inaction: there are few wealthy predators around. Though Baird's plans make sense (not least because Coats has mismanaged its crown jewel,Jaeger women's wear), Coats is unwilling to demerge clothes from its thread business. Though Baird is one of the better-run groups, its market capitalisation of E7m is too small for it to make a bid for the whole of Coats, worth 192m. David Suddens, Baird's chief executive, is frustrated: ""What's the point in being a quoted company? I can't use our paper. Even banks are saying `Christ no-not the retail sector, not the textile sector.' No one wants to know."" 
Anyway, being bigger may not be the answer. Ron McDerment, a textiles analyst at HSBC Securities, a stockbroking firm, argues that good old-fashioned management matters much more. ""[This business] needs managers who can be two things at oncedisciplined cost cutters who can run a tight supply chain and creatives who can get designs and fabrics right."" Sadly, the textiles business finds it hard to attract and retain talent. Like the clothes at M&S, British textiles have lost their appeal.  1999 Economic liberalism is surviving trial by recession, according to the latest worldwide opinion poll by Angus Reid and The Economist 
HISTORICALLY, recession is the midwife of protectionism. In good times, peoples and nations are happy to enjoy the benefits of open trade. Come bad times, they are tempted to minimise short-run pain through protection. 
The great question now is whether the liberal policies that have taken hold in many countries around the world in the 198os and 199os can survive an economic setback. During 1998, such a setback threatened to grow from being merely regional into one that, in 1999, could be more or less global. The Asian ""tigers"" had suddenly turned pussycats in 1997, and in 1998 their recessions proved deep. The Russian economy stubbornly refused to reform itself, and the country defaulted on its debts. Long Term Capital Management, a hedge fund, went dramatically belly-up, prompting a private-sector rescue costing an estimated $4 billion. World stockmarkets turned sharply bearish in the early autumn. Forecasts for 1999 were for little or no growth, worldwide. 
Predictably, the voices ofthe protectionists were raised again. There were those who thought the blame lay in excessively free currency markets. George Soros, who had made his multi-billion-dollar fortune from such markets, published a book, ""The Crisis of Global Capitalism"" (Little, Brown L$17.99; Perseus Books $26, making this case. And there were those who wanted to guard domestic jobs against foreign competition or the pressures of foreign slumps. In both America and Asia, politicians began to raise the protectionist banner. 
Yet as far as public opinion is concerned, they have got nowhere. Amazing as it may seem, there has been no increase in popular support for protectionism worldwide over the last year (see chart on this page). An opinion poll carried out among more than 12,000 adults in 22 countries worldwide by the Angus Reid Group, a Canadian pollster, for The Economist shows that the proportion favouring protection did not change: at 48% last year to 47% this year, the fall is insignificant statistically. The conspicuous point is that the proportion of protectionists has failed to rise. 
The question asked was: ""Which of the following two broad approaches do you think would be the best way to improve the economic and employment situation in this country-protecting our local industries by restricting imports, or removing import restrictions to increase our international trade?"" This was designed to flush out true free traders. To count as one, a respondent had actually to favour lower barriers against imports and not merely to oppose the building of new barriers. It might therefore have been expected to understate the number of anti-protectionists. 
True, on this measure, protectionists do just outnumber free traders (47% to 42% worldwide) In particular, some Asian countries such as Malaysia remain strongly protectionist. Even in traditionally freetrading Asian countries, such as Taiwan, support for free trade has fallen. In 1997, free traders outnumbered protectionists in Taiwan by more than three to one. Now the ratio is two-to-one. 
But protectionism seems to be a lagging indicator rather than a leading one: in other words, bad times must come before it rises, rather than merely being expected to come. For support for free trade amongst the large, and still economically robust European Union economies-Britain, alas, excepted-has grown sharply. Even in Colbertist France, free traders are now only slightly outnumbered by protectionists. 
Nor has America begun to flinch. Not that the American dream of freedom has ever quite extended to international trade. A clear majority of Americans (56% to 37%) are protectionists even today. Yet over the past year, support for protectionism in America has hardly increased. 
The poll also sought to measure support for economic liberalism in a second way, by looking at countries' internal economic policies. Respondents here were asked: ""Which of the following would you prefer? More free and open competition between suppliers of goods and services, or more controls, subsidies and regulations from your government?"" 
Arguably, this question tends to encourage the liberal answer, just as the one on trade tends to encourage the protectionist answer. Even so, the support for competition-within living memory a dirty word to many-is impressive. 
Globally, economic liberals are in a two-to-one majority on this question. In North America, the majority is nearer to four-to-one. In Asia the liberals outnumber their opponents by more than two-to-one. They are now in a clear majority in Western Europe, and a majority, albeit not statistically significant, in Latin America. Globally the majority favouring competition over government control is down slightly compared with last year, by five percentage points. But it remains solid. 
Furthermore, the poll sought to explore a third dimension of economic liberalism: support for the free movement of capital. The question was: ""There's been some discussion recently about whether or not there should be tighter restrictions on the movement of money from country to country. Some say there should be tighter restrictions on this. Others say that is not necessary. What do you think?"" 
Risky capital 
Unlike the other two measures, we were not able to compare views on this with views last year. The question was only devised this year in response to emerging criticism of the workings of free capital markets. However, the results for 1998 are less encouraging for liberals than the results of our questions on trade. 
Worldwide, there is a clear preference for tighter controls. 49% favour them with 37% against. Some 14% don't know. 
Only in Spain and Italy of the 22 countries surveyed do a clear majority of people favour free capital movements. In Asia, liberal Hong Kong now produces only a fivepercentage-point margin against restrictions, and Japan only a two percentagepoint-margin. Public opinion in Indonesia, South Korea, Thailand, and to a lesser extent in Taiwan and China is heavily against free capital movements. 
How might liberals react to these findings? There is a clear majority preferring competition to planning and regulations as a way of running an economy. Opinion on protectionism is divided but it remains stable; resisting it is no harder than it has ever been. Opinion is, however, hostile to free currency movements if not overwhelmingly so. So one way of assuaging public opinion would be to act to curb free currency and capital markets, preserving free markets in goods and services. 
Quite apart from its potential economic costs, however, this would be a risky strategy. Protectionist sentiment has a habit of starting with specific plausible cases and then extending to the general. Once the case is conceded in one area, capital movements, there is no guarantee that a new line could be held. 
A more promising avenue might be to tackle instead what public opinion worldwide seems to see as a major weakness of the international economic order: the weakness of its principal international institutions. The worldwide standing of those institutions is deplorably low. 
Take first the International Monetary Fund (IMF) Its policy of forcing budgetary discipline and market-based reform on member-countries has had the broad support of most pro-capitalist economists, though the developing world has been less enthusiastic. But that support is not mirrored in public opinion. Only one respondent in 20 worldwide says that they have ""a lot of confidence"" in the IMF. Only in India and the Philippines did more than one person in ten have a lot of confidence in the IMF. Internationally, four times as many respondents do not have much confidence at all in it, and those with little confidence outnumber those with confidence by nearly two to one. 
Nor does the IMF's sister organisation for development, the World Bank, fare any better. Again, four people think not much at all of its efforts for every one who has a lot of confidence in it. In only four countries of the 22 surveyed-India, Indonesia, Italy and the Philippines-do those favourable to the World Bank outnumber those unfavourable. Indeed, those questioned by our pollsters have more confidence in the United States to do something about world economic problems than they do for the work of either of the organisations specifically charged with dealing with such problems. For policymakers in 1999, that could prove powerful food for thought. 
The full poll results can be found on our website at www.economist.com  1999 IF THE most urgent question for Republicans in 1998 was why there was so little outrage about Bill Clinton's morals, the most urgent question for protectionists was why there was so little outrage about the surge in foreign takeovers of American companies. 
In the late 198os, when Japanese companies pocketed such American landmarks as the Rockefeller Centre and Columbia Pictures, the country went into a collective funk. A Newsweek cover declared that Japan was ""buying the soul of America""-and Michael Crichton wrote a best-seller, ""Rising Sun"", that was supposed to expose just how dreadful this prospect could be. In 1998, when foreign companies took over Random House, Chrysler, Bankers Trust and Amoco, there was scarcely a murmur of complaint. 
Why? Quite simply, because Americans are now convinced that theirs is the strongest economy in the world. In the 198os Americans hung their heads as the Japanese seized world-leadership in everything from cars to electronics. In the 199os they stood tall again as American companies dominated all the most exciting new industries, from computers to media to finance, and the American economy enjoyed its longest inflation-free expansion since 1945. 
Moreover, American firms are as likely to be the buyers as the bought. In 1989, American investment abroad was about half as much as foreign direct investment in the United States; in 1997, it was more than 25% bigger. Besides, a growing number of Americans-particularly in Silicon Valley and Hollywoodnow see foreign investors less as barbarians at the gates than as cash-rich country cousins who want nothing more than a chance to invest in American success. 
Still, for all their newfound self-confidence Americans remain surprisingly sceptical about free trade: far more sceptical than crisis-battered South Koreans or risk-averse Germans. Despite the booming economy, Bill Clinton has repeatedly failed to win renewal of his ""fast track"" authority to negotiate trade deals, blocking his desires to extend free trade to the whole of Latin America. 
Most of Mr Clinton's fellow Democrats in Congress don't share his enthusiasm for free trade, advocating all sorts of restrictions to do with labour and the environment; and a noisy group of Republican populists is intent on pushing their party in a more protectionist direction. An unholy alliance of these two factions succeeded in holding up the administration's request for $18 billion for the IMF for months, linking the grant to all sorts of time-wasting issues such as dolphin conservation. 
The fact that the IMF got its money in the end suggests that the initiative still lies with the internationalists. But the fact that, eight years into an economic boom, only 37% of Americans claim to support free trade also suggests that economic liberalism would have a harder time surviving trial by recession there than it has in much of the rest of the world.  1999 IF THE most urgent question for Republicans in 1998 was why there was so little outrage about Bill Clinton's morals, the most urgent question for protectionists was why there was so little outrage about the surge in foreign takeovers of American companies.

Despite the booming economy, Bill Clinton has repeatedly failed to win renewal of his ""fast track"" authority to negotiate trade deals, blocking his desires to extend free trade to the whole of Latin America. 
Most of Mr Clinton's fellow Democrats in Congress don't share his enthusiasm for free trade, advocating all sorts of restrictions to do with labour and the environment; and a noisy group of Republican populists is intent on pushing their party in a more protectionist direction. An unholy alliance of these two factions succeeded in holding up the administration's request for $18 billion for the IMF for months, linking the grant to all sorts of time-wasting issues such as dolphin conservation. 
The fact that the IMF got its money in the end suggests that the initiative still lies with the internationalists. But the fact that, eight years into an economic boom, only 37% of Americans claim to support free trade also suggests that economic liberalism would have a harder time surviving trial by recession there than it has in much of the rest of the world.  1999 THE map above sets out, country by country, the balance of opinion in each of the countries surveyed on the respondents' own country's present economic condition, on its prospects for next year, and on the view of its people on global economic prospects. 
Americans are delighted with their own economy. Some 85% of Americans say it is performing well to only 14% who say it is performing poorly. By a majority of more than three to one, Americans say their own standard of living has improved. But they are not so confident about next year. More think that their economy will get worse than think it will get better. This is probably because a plurality of them are pretty pessimistic about the prospects for the world economy. 
By contrast, the Russians beat the Japanese by a short head for the title of the world's most despairing country. Of Russians, 98% think that the country is doing badly, compared with 91% of Japanese. By a four-to-one margin, the Russians expect things to get worse compared with a margin amongst the Japanese of just over three-to-one on the side of pessimism. 
Dissatisfaction with their government's performance is expressed by 87% of Russians; but an eccentric (nay, extraordinary) 9% think that it is doing well. Similarly, 86% of Japanese are dissatisfied with their government's performance, again with a loyalist 9% applauding their rulers' performance. 
Eighteen Russians think their living standard has got worse over the last year for every one who thinks it has improved. Eleven Japanese feel they are worse off for every one who feels better off. But the Japanese are much more pessimistic about the world economy than are the Russians. Barely more Russians expect the world economy to deteriorate than expect it to improve, but 39% of Japanese think it will deteriorate, while only 4% that it will improve. 
In Asia, gloom is not confined to Japan. South Korea is at the bottom of the pessimists' pack with 88% of her people thinking her economy is in poor shape. Indonesia and Thailand are not reckoned by their people to be doing much better, and Hong Kong is not far behind them. But in all four countries most people expect 1999 to be better economically than 1998. Can this be ascribed to an ""Asian value"" of optimism about the future? Well, in Japan the expectation is of a further deterioration. 
In Europe, outside Britain, the mood ahead of the launch of the single currency on January ist is quite buoyant. In France, Germany and Spain, pluralities think their economies are doing well. In Italy, however, slightly more people think it is doing poorly than think it is doing well. People in all four of these European countries think that their countries will do well in 1999 too. 
The United Kingdom is a bit of a European oddity. Britons are quite cheerful about the state of their economy and a higher proportion (58%) is satisfied with the performance of its government than is true in any other country surveyed outside Asia. But when it comes to prospects for next year, Britons are in pessimistic mood. Some 48% of them expect the world economy to deteriorate, with only 14% expecting it to improve. This is the most negative assessment in any country surveyed except Japan. 
While most of the European Union countries have become much keener on free trade and open markets, Britons have become more protectionist. Of those questioned in Britain, 53% now say they favour protection to 37% opposing it. This represents a net increase of IZ percentage points in protectionist sentiment between 1997 and 1998. 
Latin America is particularly gloomy. Amongst Mexicans, 85% think their economy is performing poorly, as do 75% of Brazilians. Only 29% of Latin Americans think their economy will improve next year, while 41% think it will get worse. The rest either don't know, or think it will stay the same. 
Comparing China and India, both think their economies are doing poorly, but the Indians are the more dissatisfied. Both think they will do better next year, with the Chinese much more optimistic Both also think the world economy will recover next year, again with the Chinese rather more optimistic  1999 Financial institutions are rushing to be ready for the euro's launch. The mood is confident, but there is no guarantee that things will follow the script 
THE dress rehearsals are over, the curtain is rising, and the leading players are scurrying to ensure that the performance begins on time-and wins plaudits. At lunchtime on December 31st, European finance ministers announced the rates at which ii national currencies would convert to Europe's single currency, the euro. By the time financial markets reopen on January 4th, banks must be ready to trade in euros. Between those dates lies a ""changeover weekend"", during which bankers, fund managers, securities dealers and regulators will be working around the clock, slurping not champagne but unseasonally sobering coffee. 
This frantic activity follows months of testing and retesting of banks' computer systems and their links to domestic stock exchanges and clearing houses. Some big banks have undergone five separate dry runs, and most claim they are ready. Still, there are plenty of butterflies. ""It's been like a play in which everyone has been rehearsing in separate dressing rooms,"" says Paul Cantwell of Andersen Consulting. ""When they all take the stage together, no one can be sure how the performance will go."" 
Still, there will be no shortage of action. Over the weekend, on top of doing their normal end-of-year accounts, financial firms must also plug the euro conversion rates into all of their software programs, reroute much of their foreign-exchange trading and redenominate bonds, shares, derivatives portfolios and bank accounts previously held in separate euro-zone currencies. Small wonder that, as well as booking up local hotel rooms, Goldman Sachs has taken the precaution of designating special ""rest areas"" for weary staff 
Although Britain is not adopting the euro, the City, as Europe's largest financial centre, has a feverish air of expectation. After three years of military-style planning, some 30,ooo financial folk will work over the new year weekend to guarantee a smooth transition. Fearful for London's financial-centre status, the City of London Corporation, a wealthy local authority run as a benevolent dictatorship, is doing its bit. It is paying to keep open the ""drain"", a short but key commuter line; making all of its 3,500 parking spaces free; and banning noisy construction work over the weekend. 
Regulators too will be missing lots of new year parties. The Bank of England is bringing in 300 staff to oversee internal changes and monitor the banking system. However, in a sign of public-sector austerity, hungry staff will have to pay for their own take-away food outside normal hours (contrast this with one French bank, which for some weeks has had a member of staff testing possible menus for the right balance of nourishment for the overwrought brain). All of Europe's national central banks will be in regular contact with the European Central Bank's changeover committee, which will be on hand to take emergency action. Members of the ECB'S governing council have been asked to stay within reach of a secure telephone. 
Judging by the mood in Frankfurt, they won't be needed. German bankers ooze confidence, scoffing at talk of last-minute panics. Deutsche Borse, which runs the Frankfurt Stock Exchange, has spent six months fine-tuning its trading and settlement systems for the euro, and does not expect its 9o-strong conversion team to be particularly busy at the weekend. So confident is it that it has set up a special web site (www.eurostatus.exchange.de) so the curious can check on its progress hour by hour. 
Not that the Germans are leaving much to chance. At Commerzbank, where 400 employees will be at work or on stand-by, all calls into the bank will be routed directly to mobile telephones, so that everyone can be reached within seconds. Deutsche Bank has conducted 59 separate trial runs, linking its computers with clearing systems around Europe. During the conversion weekend, 2,ooo employees in 40 offices worldwide will be reporting to a ""global control centre"" in Eschborn, just outside Frankfurt. Deutsche claims it will be the only bank able to offer its full range of products in euros from January 4th. 
After a year in which it lost ground in the race to establish itself as a financial centre for Europe, Paris has no intention of missing any tricks over the conversion to the euro. Two years of preparation, and three rehearsals, culminating in a full dry run in November, have left the city's too-odd financial institutions quietly confident that the traditional French mastery of logistics will ensure a smooth meshing of gears over the long weekend. In all, lo,ooo people will play some part in the 9oo steps into which the exercise has been broken down. Banque Nationale de Paris has hung a 4,ooo-piece jigsaw puzzle in its euro control room, to remind the 6o0 people who will be toiling there that every little bit must fit into the bigger picture. 
Technical efficiency is one thing, but no preparations would be complete without making allowance for that other great French tradition-the strike. The French Bankers Association and the unions have duly negotiated special exemptions from the usual limits on working hours and requirements for Sunday rest. 
Attitudes in Italy seem altogether more laid back. Italian banks say they are ready for the euro, but have much smaller changeover teams on hand than their French and German counterparts. And compared with the Germans, the Italians do not seem to mind if everything does not go like clockwork. A senior official from the Bank of Italy, the central bank, says languidly, ""It will not be the end of the world if things go wrong on Monday. Systems will be working fine on Tuesday or Wednesday."" 
For all the confident talk, there are legitimate fears that the conversion process could still be derailed. Never before has so much depended on so many financial institutions doing so many things simultaneously. Michael Foot, the director in charge of euro planning at the Financial Services Authority, Britain's financial regulator, acknowledges three concerns for the weekend: that banks will run out of time; that data will be corrupted; and that some markets will not be able to reopen first thing Monday morning. Moreover, custodians might ""lose"" assets, and thus be unable to release them. 
Beyond the weekend lies much more work, including tests for settlement systems. Mistakes by one bank in paying another-for example by paying into the wrong account-could prevent the payee from settling its own debts, leading to financial gridlock. SHIFT, which runs a network through which many interbank payments are made, has assembled a 150strong team to help banks deal with payments problems. To avoid bottlenecks, it has warned banks against paying in very large batches. ""Like everyone else we are hoping for the best, but planning for the worst,"" says a spokesman. 
For all the gloomy scenarios, no one is much concerned about the big institutions. At least, not directly. All the big banks in Europe are convinced that they have done enough tinkering-or will have done by Monday-to greet the euro with confidence. Merrill Lynch, for example, has set aside around $8om for the total cost of conversion. More worrying are small and middie-sized banks, which are generally much less well prepared, and the knock-on effect their lack of foresight may have on others. As one apparently well-prepared banker from Salomon Smith Barney puts it: ""You can be driving carefully, but if someone comes around the corner and smashes into you, there isn't much you can do.""  1999 HOWEVER much of a challenge the birth of the euro may seem to bankers in Milan, Italy's financial centre, in the Sicilian capital of Palermo it is being seen as a disaster. The Sicilian regional government is gripped by a financial crisis. Its problem is simple: the regional government has run out of cash (it needs 1.7 trillion lire-$i billion-to balance this year's books) and can't persuade anyone to give it more. Franco Piro, Sicily's head of finance, complains that Sicily is owed 3 trillion lire by the central government. ""We are being punished by the criteria of the Maastricht treaty,"" he moans: the central government has been squeezing spending to fit the country's budget deficit into the 3% corset needed to qualify for euro membership. 
The regional government had previously been able to get loans from domestic and foreign banks to plug the hole; but on December 23rd, the 45 banks that it had approached refused to help. Although Mr Piro ascribes bankers' reluctance to the distractions of Christmas and preparations for the euro, there were weightier reasons for it. Some 30% of bank loans in Sicily are non-performing; the regional government itself has run up some 6 trillion lire in unpaid bills. Nasty experiences in Asia and Russia have made banks more wary of such borrowers. 
Above all, Sicily suffers a huge credibility problem, says Pietro Busetta, head of Fon-dazione Curella, a Palermo thinktank. Local politicians have squandered Sicily's annual budget; many have sought office only for personal gain. ""The solution is to pull down the shutters on the regional government, he suggests. Responsibility could be shifted to Sicily's city councils, which in recent years have been strikingly more efficient than the regional tier. 
But this is unlikely to happen soon. In any case, after changes in central and regional governments in November, both the governing coalition and the Sicilian regional government are now of a similar political complexion. Mr Busetta thinks that makes a rescue from Rome more likely. And there's a bonus: having slipped the lira into the euro, the Italian government is now unlikely to give financial rigour a high priority.  1999 HOWEVER much of a challenge the birth of the euro may seem to bankers in Milan, Italy's financial centre, in the Sicilian capital of Palermo it is being seen as a disaster.

China, where few ordinary citizens have a credit card (indeed, where credit-cardstyle revolving consumer lending is illegal), is MasterCard's second-largest market after America. In 1997, the latest year for which figures are available, its turnover in China was an astounding $73 billion. 
How is the circle squared? As in some other countries, MasterCards in China are more debit than credit cards: cardholders must deposit money into their accounts. Purchases are deducted from these funds. MasterCard's success in China is thus more an indictment of the country's dreadful banks than a capitalist celebration of plastic. Almost all transactions are between businesses for big-ticket items such as tractors and trainloads of raw materials. Chinese companies often use credit cards-rather than cheques or wire transfers-to buy goods and services from each other. 
In the mid-198os, when MasterCard entered the market, the clearing system between banks in different cities was (and is) almost non-existent: a cheque could take up to a month to clear, and many sellers would not release goods until it did. The country did not have the nationwide telecommunications networks necessary for an electronic clearing system. Company executives were forced to carry suitcases of cash if they wanted to seal a deal on the spot. MasterCard uses people at the end of a telephone to approve a purchase rather than computerised links, thus making do with what is available. 
But the company's best days in China may be over. In 1999 the government plans a nationwide electronic clearing and settlement system to connect financial institutions. Still, MasterCard may not be too worried. These, after all, are Chinese banks: expect delays.  1999 SHARE prices in much of the world ended 1998 higher than they started it. Oddly, at the same time, the profitability of companies is shrinking, even in the world's leading economies. This begs the question of whether equity prices in rich countries now make any sense at all-but it also gives ominous warning of disappointing economic growth to come in 1999 
Share prices rose, on average, by more than 15% in 1998 in six of the rich world's biggest economies. But in the third quarter, the latest period for which there is data, company profits were 12% lower than a year earlier in those economies (see chart). Much of this is due to the continued sufferings of Japanese firms. But corporate profitability has fallen compared with the previous year in the other big economies as well. 
Continued economic strife in Asia is one cause of slimmer profit margins elsewhere. The devaluation of Asian currencies, and a huge amount of excess productive capacity, have intensified global price competition, especially in homogeneous, tradable goods such as textiles, chemicals and commodities. But in America and Britain, several years of decent economic growth have driven down unemployment to such an extent that labour costs are starting to rise-although the impact of this has been cushioned by higher productivity. 
These factors are unlikely to go away in 1999. And in continental Europe, the launch of the euro may increase price competition by making differences in pricing between countries in the euro-zone more transparent to consumers. 
In the case of corporate profits, the main uncertainty is how fast, if at all, the world's big economies will grow. The frenzied cutting of short-term interest rates by central bankers since the autumn's brief financial-market crisis seems to have averted the worst for now. But yields on corporate bonds, especially American ones, are typically higher now than six months ago, because investors are more worried about the riskiness of these securities. 
Worse, the recent decline in corporate profitability may itself point to slower growth ahead. In the past, changing profitability has been a useful lead indicator of economic trends. One reason is that, when firms earn lower profits, they generally become less optimistic about their future profitability, and vice versa-and so cut (or boost) their investment spending accordingly. Capital spending by companies is an important contributor to economic growth. If there is less of it, growth suffers. In continental Europe, most of the economic growth during the 199os was due to higher spending by companies. 
America's economy is now especially vulnerable to a sharp reduction in investment by firms. Much attention has been lavished on American consumers' alarming recent habit of spending more than they earn. But American companies also have a ""negative savings ratio"", points out David Mackie, an economist at J.P. Morgan, because they have been borrowing so much to invest. British and continental European companies, in contrast, have not paid for capital spending in the 199os by getting deeper into debt. 
Running up debts to finance investment may make sense in conditions of rapid economic growth. But, when growth slows and profitability tumbles, heavy indebtedness will force companies to make ferocious cuts in capital spending. Mr Mackie thinks this could be severe enough to push the American economy into deep recession. A similar thing happened in Japan, that other ""miracle economy"", in the early i99os. Companies had been borrowing and investing as though the economy would grow for ever. Its economy is still paying the price. Japan's problems have mired Asia in recession; if America's economy went down the plughole, the rest of the world would probably follow suit.  1999 Profits of doom

CAR makers have long used sex to peddle their wares. Recently, however, a new twist to this old idea has developed. Or, rather, two twists-the double helix of DNA. For both BMW and Renault have based their latest European marketing campaigns around this icon of modem biology. Their advertising agents, it seems, have decided that genetics is metaphorically, as well as literally, sexy. 
Advertising agents, of course, are paid to be sensitive to subtle shifts in the Zeitgeist, so the two campaigns might be seen as an indication of how the public actually perceives genetics and the related subject of evolutionary theory. Not surprisingly, a few outdated myths are perpetuated. Both advertisements, for instance, play on the popular conception of evolution not just as change, but as progress-something which many biologists would dispute. But the gist of the advertising shows just how much the central concerns of modern biology have indeed entered the popular consciousness. (There is also a surprising popular appetite for mathematics-see box on next page.) 
BMW'S campaign, which launches its new 3-series sports saloon in Britain and Ireland, shows the new creation and four of its earlier incarnations zigzagging around a landscape made up of giant DNA sequences, with a brief explanation that DNA is the molecule responsible for the inheritance of such features as strength, power and intelligence. The Renault offering, which promotes its existing Laguna model, employs evolutionary theory even more explicitly. The company's television commercials intersperse clips of the car with scenes from a lecture by Steve Jones, a professor of genetics at University College London. Besides Dr Jones, who is one of Britain's most media-friendly scientists, the lecture features pictures of fossils of extinct animals called trilobites, and also the cliched ascent of man from ape to human. 
According to Jeremy Hemmings, who heads BMW's campaign at wcRs, a London advertising firm, the advertisement is intended to convey the idea of development allied to heritage. The latest product, in other words, should be viewed as the new and improved scion of a long line of good cars-with the implication that what is true of the car is also true of the driver. 
The advertisement is stark and highly stylised. To the untutored eye, the DNA sequences look like enormous black-runged ladders (they are actually enlargements of the electrophoretic gels used to tease out the individual genetic ""letters"" of which DNA is composed). But the eyes of BMW drivers are not, of course, untutored. The car is a status symbol in a society where success depends on knowledge, and the ad panders to the presumption that its viewers will have the knowledge to understand it. According to Mr Hemmings, they do. It has had one of BMW'S highest awareness ratings-a measure of how well people remember the product, and the message conveyed. 
Renault's message, according to Jonathan Wignall, the head of the Laguna campaign at the company's British subsidiary, is more subtle. It is that evolution works by gradual improvements rather than sudden leaps (in this, Renault is aligning itself with biological orthodoxy). So, although the new car in the advertisement may look like the old one, the external form conceals a number of significant changes to the engine. While these alterations are almost invisible to the average driver, Renault hopes they will improve the car's performance, and ultimately its survival in the marketplace. 
Whether they actually do so will depend, in part, on whether marketeers have read the public mood correctly. For, even if genetics really does offer a useful metaphor for automobiles, employing it in advertising is not without its dangers. 
That is because DNA'S public image is ambiguous. In one context, people may see it as the cornerstone of modern medical progress. In another, it will bring to mind such controversial issues as abortion, genetically modified foodstuffs, and the sinister subject of eugenics. 
In some countries, such as Germany (where the BMW campaign has not run, even though the company is German), people are particularly sensitive to these issues. And when genetics is not merely a metaphor, but the actual product, things can go horribly wrong-as Monsanto, an American biotechnology company, found when it spent L1m ($1.68m) attempting to persuade the British ofthe merits of genetically engineered foodstuffs. The actual effect of the campaign, unluckily for Monsanto, was to alert sceptical consumers to the fact that something they may have thought would be happening in the indeterminate future was about to hit their supermarket shelves. Few liked the idea. 
Car makers are probably standing on safer ground than biotechnology firms. But even they can make mistakes. Though it would not be obvious to the casual observer, some of the DNA which features in BMW'S ads for its nice, new car once belonged to a woolly mammoth-a beast that has been extinct for 10,000 years. Not, presumably, quite the message that the marketing department was trying to convey.  1999 IF AN old rule of thumb from the publishing industry is to believed, every equation included in a book halves the number sold. Yet in recent months several mathematical treatises have become bestsellers. Slim volumes have told the stories of the numbers e, n (which has also had a film named after it) and i (the square root of-1), while other books have explored the nature of infinity, the workings of calculus and, most successfully of all, how Fermat's last theorem was eventually proved after centuries of effort. Given how much schoolchildren hate maths, this is all rather surprising. 
The secret, it turns out, is to stick to the old rule and leave out the dreaded equations-and, indeed, any other scary-looking squiggles likely to remind readers of their school days. Instead, mathematical blockbusters take the form of biographies (often, admittedly, of numbers, not people), histories (of the calendar, for exampie), quests (to prove or disprove things), or coming-of-age tales such as ""Good Will Hunting"", a film in which a young prodigy redeems himself through mathematics. In other words, standard story-telling devices are used to sugar the mathematical pill. 
The resulting books and films are appealing for two reasons, according to Peter Tallack of Weidenfeld & Nicolson, a British publisher. First, they are aspirational: they offer readers the illusion of grappling with mathematical concepts, without having to do the hard work of actually understanding them. A classic example is Simon Singh's book on Fermat's last theorem, which wafts such abstruse ideas as modular forms, elliptic curves, and Galois theory under the reader's nose. 
The second reason is that these mathematical blockbusters provide an attractive and convenient excuse for people who hated maths at school. ""Look,"" they can say, ""I liked this book, so I must simply have had useless teachers."" (Do not ask someone who offers this excuse after reading Dr Singh's book to prove Fermat's last theorem over dinner.)

The Detroit display is, of course, a publicity stunt. It is unlikely that customers will be content to inspect a mere hologram before they buy. But the Zebra system has several serious purposes. When perfected, it will speed up the design process by giving engineers a real sense of what their brainchildren look like, without the need for the clay models they currently employ. And, when a design is completed, the senior executives who make the decision about whether to put it into production will have a much better idea of what it is that they are approving or rejecting. 
If mass produced, Zebra's system could also add a new dimension to poster advertising-and not just in the car industry. The company is planning to market the invention to a wide range of advertising and entertainment firms. So, although the holodeck of the starship Enterprise may still be some way off, the ads for Star Trek movies may soon have their own dimensions of virtual reality.  1999 JOURNALISTS attending the Detroit Motor Show-the American automobile industry's top annual shindig-are used to seeing concept cars. These are vehicles that incorporate the sort of technological wizardry which manufacturers hope to put into their production models a year or two hence. This year, however, Ford will go one better. The star of its stand is the P2000, a car that is not so much conceptual as non-existent. And yet visitors to the stand will be able to walk around it, look inside and underneath it, and do almost everything to it that motoring journalists normally do except kick its tyres and drive off in it. For the P2000 is a hologram. 
Holography, of course, is nothing new. But the technology that has produced the P2ooo is a significant step forward for several reasons. First, it allows holograms to be big (currently, the largest are about a metre, or three feet, across; the P2000 image is printed on ten 6ocm-square panels, making it three metres by two). Second, it abolishes the weird distortions of parallax which normal holograms suffer when examined from the wrong direction. Third, it produces accurate colours. And fourth, you don't actually have to have a real object to photograph. 
This holographic paragon was invented by Michael Klug and his colleagues at Zebra Imaging, in Austin, Texas, when they were students at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology's Media Laboratory. It works by building on a surprising holographic principle-that each bit of the film carrying a hologram actually contains a whole image. (In other words, if you cut a piece of holographic film in two, and look at one half, you will still see a complete picture, albeit with a more restricted view.) 
Zebra's process makes this explicit. Its holograms are, like a television image, composed of numerous elements (called ""hogels"", in imitation of a television screen's ""pixels""), each of which is a complete hologram in its own right, but is taken from a slightly different angle to its neighbours. 
""Taken"" is, perhaps, not quite the right word. Since the P2000 doesn't exist, there is no object to take even a single image of, let alone the 9oo,ooo images that go to make up the Zebra hologram. This deficiency is made up for by the computers in Ford's design department, on which the P200 has been conceived. These machines are able to ""view"" the new car from any angle they like, under any lighting conditions that are programmed into them, and it is these individual views, known as ray traces, that are used to generate the hogels. 
A hologram of a real object is made by splitting a laser beam in two, reflecting one of the two resulting sub-beams off the object of interest, recombining the sub-beams, and exposing a photographic plate or film to the result. The interference between the subbeam that has been reflected off the object and the unaffected (or ""reference"") sub-beam produces a pattern on the plate which, when developed and illuminated, reveals a three-dimensional picture of the original object. 
In the case of the P2,ooo, the object sub-beam is directed through a liquid-crystal screen rather than on to a real object. The screen is under computer control, and the pattern of the liquid crystals is designed to produce the same effect on the passing light that a real P2000 would have. The two subbeams are then recombined in the normal way and the result shone on to a 2mm-wide square on a piece of photosensitive plastic to create a hogel. 
In practice, three lasers-one for each of the primary colours red, green and blueare shone through the screen simultaneously to produce a full-colour hogel. The process is then repeated for a neighbouring hogel using a neighbouring ray trace. 
Making the master image is a time-consuming process. The ray trace for each hogel must be computed separately; even using the latest Silicon Graphics supercomputers, that takes over a second.

So, although the holodeck of the starship Enterprise may still be some way off, the ads for Star Trek movies may soon have their own dimensions of virtual reality.  1999 IN THE next few days the shutters will be coming off the world's biggest scientific mirror. It is 8.3 metres (326 inches) across, and although it sits on a mountain top on the island of Hawaii rather than in Japan itself, it is the pride and joy of Japanese astronomy. It is the heart of the National Astronomical Observatory of Japan's latest toy, the Subaru telescope-a device named after the star cluster known to westerners as the Pleiades. 
National pride was, indeed, an important motive for building the new telescope. That its mirror is 10cm wider than any other telescope's gives Japan's bureaucrats a warm glow that probably makes up for their having to change the law to grant diplomatic privileges to the civil-service astronomers travelling to Hawaii to operate it That it is 6.42 metres wider than the mirror of the country's largest existing instrument-a tiddler located near Okayama, in western Honshugives an even warmer glow to the astronomers themselves. Now they will be able to make some serious observations in the visible and infra-red frequencies, and thus hold up their heads at conferences. 
Such size, however, can bring problems of its own. Big mirrors are expensive, so the modern trend is towards computer-controlled arrays of smaller, cheaper mirrors that can be co-ordinated to mimic the behaviour of a single large one. Big mirrors also tend to sag under their own weight, distorting as they move around to look at different parts of the sky. 
In Subaru's case the sagging is dealt with by making the mirror thin-a mere 20cm from back to front. Though that also makes it more flexible (and makes the ability to grind and polish the glass to create a light-capturing parabolic surface without actually breaking the thing all the more impressive), this flexibility can be exploited to keep the reflective surface in shape. 
That is done by 261 ""actuator"" arms, which push on the mirror from behind to preserve the curvature so precisely that it can distinguish two objects 1/18,000th of a degree apart-the equivalent of being able to spot a tennis ball on the neighbouring island of Maui, 100km away. 
This, combined with a new digital camera developed for it by Mitsubishi Electric, will make it the most powerful groundbased optical telescope around. And when its aluminium coating is replaced with silver in a year or two's time (a huge vacuumchamber housed at the telescope's base will be used to deposit metallic vapour on to the mirror's reflecting surface), it will be able to see into the infra-red with equal clarity, opening up a much neglected area of astronomy. Indeed, at some wavelengths it should out-perform the Hubble space telescope, which does not even have the handicap of looking through the atmosphere. 
But what will it search for? One bothersome thing astronomers have discovered, as they have peered ever deeper into space, has been unexpected regions of sheer emptiness. Like huge bubbles, these so-called ""great voids"", which are hundreds of millions of light-years across, seem to be surrounded by thin films. In this case the films are composed of billions of individual galaxies. The universe, in other words, appears to be made of foam. 
The most likely explanation for this is that gravitational forces from invisible socalled ""dark matter""-perhaps lOO times more abundant than the observable matter in the universe-are tugging that observable matter into odd shapes. By measuring some of these large bubbles, Norio Kaifu, the head of the project in Hawaii, hopes that Subaru will provide astronomers with a clearer idea of what, if it actually exists, the dark matter really is. 
Further out into space, beyond lo billion light-years, Subaru will be able to see the universe in its infancy-not long after the primordial fireball cooled enough to become transparent. While still unable to observe the actual beginning of the universe (signs of which are reckoned to be 15 billion light-years away), the telescope will be able to detect some of the earliest objects to condense from the primordial gas. 
These objects are predicted to be galaxies in their initial star-forming phase, with giant black holes at their centres. Dr Kaifu hopes to find them by using naturally occurring ""gravitational lenses"" to boost Subaru's magnification still further. 
A gravitational lens is a galaxy that lies exactly between a more distant object and the earth. Its gravitational field thus bends and focuses the light from the distant object, making it appear closer than it really is. Such lenses have already been used successfully by the Hubble telescope but, with its longer reach, Subaru ought to be able to employ them to look still further afield. Size, it appears, does matter after all.  1999 The war against drugs is either not working or succeeding at too high a cost, several recent books agree. What should replace it is harder to be certain of

THE Fix By Michael Massing. Simon and Schuster; 335 pages; $25 
WAR is a dirty business, and the war Won drugs involves plenty of filth: deceit, corruption and damage to civil liberties, not to mention outright violence-and that's just from the good guys. Every struggle has to have heroes, and America's antidrugs campaign makes its casting billboard-clear. The white hats are enforcement agents stamping out narcotics at home and abroad, police sweeping dealers and users off the streets,judges jailing drug offenders, not to mention plucky little civilians who ""just say no"". The black hats are shadowy figures: greedy drug barons, mostly foreign, who exploit their own countrymen and corrupt America's children. Congress and Hollywood, spurred on by alarmed parents, have created such a drugs mythology that the good and evil of narcotics is now as distinct, to many, as Mother Teresa and Saddam Hussein. 
Yet today's highly militarised drugs campaign originated in more than medicine and morality. From the start the war has involved political interest and financial gain, as well as frequent misunderstanding-not to mention downright misrepresentation-of the best evidence about drugs' medical and social effects. 
If these were novel or incidental mistakes, the war might be more understandable. But, along with social concern and good sense, modern drug policy has from the start involved fear and unreason, often directed against foreigners or outsiders. It is almost 125 years since authorities in San Francisco launched an early salvo in the western war on drugs by clamping down on opium use among the growing population of Chinese labourers. In the years leading up to the Harrison Act of 1914, which amounted to the first federal ban on nonmedical narcotics, its drafters played on fears of drug-crazed, sex-mad negroes to win support in the South. 
Then 20 years later, the spectre of the sky-high, violent Mexican immigrant was played up to sell the public on the criminalising of marijuana. At several times since the 1930s, governments have used the drug card, whether to lean on dispensible foreign dictators or to brush back homegrown countercultures. 
One thing that has changed, though, are the high stakes that America is willing to play. In 198o, the federal government spent around $1 billion on drug control; federal, state and local spending last year exceeded $30 billion, which includes much expanded programmes of crop eradication, border patrolling and sting operations. Only a third of the federal government's drug-control spending goes on drugs education or drugs treatment. 
How much success this money buys depends on your definition. According to United Nations estimates, Americans are spending almost $60 billion on illegal drugs a year, mainly on the ""soft"" drug, marijuana, and its ""hard"" counterparts, cocaine and heroin. These are, unavoidably, guesstimates. But nobody seriously contests that drugs continue to pour into America and that prices have fallen. Cocaine costs half or less what it did in the early 198os and heroin sells for just under $1,ooo a gram, three-fifths of its price a decade ago. Purity has also increased. In the 198os, street heroin was so adulterated that injecting straight into the blood was the surest way to achieve a high. Now fixes are commonly more than 5o% pure, which means that users who might be deterred by needles can smoke or snort the drug instead. 
A third of all Americans admit to having tried drugs and at least 13m are occasional users. Drug arrests were i.im in 1995, double the 198o figure. There are 400,ooo Americans behind bars for drug offences, eight times the number 19 years ago. 
Those who fight the war on drugs, with its strict penalties at home and sharp punishment abroad, point to seizures of both drugs and their users as victories. In their terms, they are. And if slowing the spread of hard drugs is a sensible goal, which it seems to be, there is indeed good news. Nationwide studies of drug use, such as the University of Michigan survey of high-school students, suggest that although teenage marijuana use has risen in recent years, experimentation with cocaine or heroin among young, first-time users has stayed fairly steady. Those who question or oppose the drugs war, however, reckon that this is the wrong body count. Although casual hard-drug consumption may be dropping, the number of hard-core hard drug users-those most directly associated with the private and collective misery of drugshas scarcely budged since the war began. 
Instead the war's critics propose an entirely new approach that drops or downplays military means and abandons unconditional surrender as the goal. The antiwar doves, as will be seen, form a growing and disputatious camp. Yet whether they favour disapproval or toleration, continued prohibition or legalisation, most doves accept that core drug abuse is not going to be eradicated at an acceptable price, that crusading moralism is counterproductive and that drugs policy should be refocused on education for the young and ""harm reduction"" for habitual users-for example, methadone programmes, needle-exchange centres or prescription heroin. 
It sounds like common sense. But good sense alone will not end the war on drugs. Both the law makers and law breakers have too much invested in the conflict for either to lay down arms easily. Even amid falling prices, drug producers continue to profit from the risk premium that prohibition puts on their multi-billion dollar industry. The anti-drug warriors' jobs and budgets depend on expensive enforcement and lucrative asset seizures. Having demonised their foes, they can only with great difficulty now make peace with the devil. 
Back to the future 
Neither side is above massaging the drugs statistics. But anyone who suspects that the critics of the drugs war are toying with the facts should read ""Drug Crazy"". This book describes the origins and consequences of America's present narcotics policy. It moves from gangland drug busts to Colombian coca plantations to Mexican border patrols. This is reportage from the front line, told with all the verve of an action film, a style which no doubt owes much to the fact that its author, Mike Gray, is a Hollywood screenwriter and producer. 
Mr Gray does not shrink from describing the violence of the drugs war, from shoot-outs in the ghettoes of Chicago to explosions on the streets of Bogota. But the legal burden of America's current drug policy comes through most clearly in his description of how drug dealers are brought to justice. Chicago's county court, which has seen its caseload quadruple in the last 20 years largely because of continued tightening of policy on drugs, now runs round the clock. 
Although most people who take crack cocaine are white, 96% of the crack defendants in federal courts are black or Hispanic. This is largely because white people, being richer, do their deals behind closed doors, while blacks and Hispanics tend to trade on the streets, where they are more easily watched and arrested. 
The night shift at Cook County court catches only the foot soldiers of such drug armies as Chicago's Gangster Disciples. The officers stay out of sight and, generally, out of jail. Justice is summary, and baffling: ten-minute trials lead to five-year sentences for possession of a fifth of an ounce of crack, while the same amount of powdered cocaine lands its owner a few weeks in prison. Crack is cocaine mixed with baking soda to make it smokable and stronger. But concentrating the drug also concentrates the penalty, introduced during the crack scare of the 198os. As blacks use more crack than powdered cocaine, the punishment falls disproportionately on them. Arrest and imprisonment are scarcely deterrents. A young lawyer at the county court is quoted as saying, ""We're not producing justice here. We're manufacturing revolutionaries."" 
On a continent once famous for revolutionaries-Latin America-the tough position of the United States has had mixed effects. The Bush administration spent $2 billion on crop eradication and substitution, spraying the jungle and bribing peasants to plant passion fruit rather than coca plants-with little success. By 1992, cocaine production had grown by 15% and the business had spread across an area the size of the continental United States. It had also become frighteningly efficient, first dominated by Pablo Escobar (a ""ruthless killer"", as Mr Gray describes him, with ""a pleasant side"") in Medellin and then the Rodriguez Orejuela brothers in Cali. The high-tech barriers America erected along its borders have succeeded in diverting entry of South American cocaine from Florida to California and Texas via Mexico, thereby drawing another country into the violence and corruption which has plagued Colombia. And the high premium that the criminalisation of drugs places on them means that South America has turned its eye to heroin, a far more profitable drug than cocaine. 
None of this, as Mr Gray stresses, should come as a surprise. America's last concerted effort at substance control, prohibition of alcohol in the 192os, had similar effects. It inflated prices, drove bootleg suppliers to organise, encouraged the spread of guns and crime, corrupted a quarter of the federal enforcement agents-and doubled the consumption of hard liquor, all within a decade. Nor does ""Drug Crazy"" neglect the influence of stubborn or strong-minded individuals. It is full of outsize characters from the past: Hamilton Wright, for example, an American doctor turned diplomat, who tried to bully the world into drug prohibition, crafted the Harrison Narcotics Act and was later sacked for drinking on the job. Or Harry Anslinger, head of drug enforcement from 1930 to to i962, who perfected the sledge hammer school of narcotics control and invoked every menace from axemen to communism. 
Drugs in history 
Because the drugs war is so noisy and so visible, it is often easy to forget that drugs are not just an American issue. Martin Booth's ""Opium: A History"" charts the rise of heroin from its ancient origins in the poppies of Eastern Europe to modern-day trade on the streets of America. The book's wealth of detail is remarkable: all aspects botanical, political, economic, cultural and pharmacological are discussed (including the unexpected etymology of such slang as ""hip"", ""hype"" and ""junkie""). Unlike ""Drug Crazy"" which is mainly focused on the Americas, much of ""Opium"" is set in Europe and Asia, giving the book a more international perspective and more comprehensive feel. 
Although Mr Booth's accounts of famous addicts, from Clive of India to John Pemberton, the inventor of Coca-Cola, make for interesting reading, the real fascination of ""Opium"" is in its account of the common man's habit through history. Until the Harrison Act, morphine and opium-mainly in the tincture laudanum or as patent medicine-were freely available in America, as they were in Europe. Opium was a sovereign cure in Victorian England for afflictions ranging from diarrhoea to depression. Babies were fed the drug in soothing syrups such as Godfrey's Cordial, leading to claims of physical and mental retardation, exactly the same concerns voiced about today's ""crack babies"". 
In 1868, British public health authorities took most opiates out of the hands of grocers and put them into those of dispensing doctors and pharmacists (as, in America, did the Harrison Act). Starting with the International Opium Commission of 1909, American efforts to curtail world manufacture, sale and distribution of opium and its derivatives met with lively resistance from Europe, India and other countries with a stake in the international trade. Yet from the 1920s to the 198os, a series of international treaties forced countries to clamp down on the production, trade and consumption of opiates, whether for ritual, for fun or as self-administered medicine. In that time, the penalties for peddling and possession tended to climb, especially in America. 
One clear historical lesson that emerges from ""Opium"" is that people will take drugs whether or not they are proscribed, and they will do so for all sorts of reasonsto escape life's burdens, for adventure, for straightforward fun. In 19th-century Britain, Mr Booth tells us, the Fens of East Anglia were awash in opium. Agricultural labourers took their pennyworth of ""elevation"" along with a nightly beer as a lift out of working drudgery. This is not so far from the plight of crack addicts in America's inner cities, boxed in by poverty, deadend jobs and broken families. 
What does vary widely with history, however, are official attitudes towards the drug trade. As Britain followed America's line in the 198os and got ""tough on drugs"", complaints were regularly fired against heroin-producing nations, such as Pakistan. Supply-side control was seen as the solution to the drug problem; if only these people would pull up their poppies, then Western drug use would plummet. Ironically, exactly the same argument was used against the British in the early 19th century, when they foisted opium from India on the Chinese in exchange for tea. When China's then drug czar, Lin Ts-hsu, complained to the British that they were breaking imperial edicts banning opium import and possession, the prime minister, Lord Palmerston, replied that the opium trade was a Chinese problem and that it should be dealt with by controlling consumption. His logic sounds familiar today. 
Such shifts are common in drug debates, according to Richard Rudgley, a University of Oxford anthropologist. Which intoxicants are forbidden and which tolerated has never added up to a very coherent story. How many exasperated parents have lectured teenagers about drugs while pouring themselves a third drink or lighting another fag? Some of the most debilitating and addictive compounds, such as alcohol and tobacco, are permitted while less obviously damaging drugs such as marijuana are widely proscribed. 
In ""The Encyclopedia of Psychoactive Substances"", Mr Rudgley offers a quick history of almost lOO drugs, sacred and profane, from the hallucinogenic mushroom amanita to the zombie mixtures of Haitian folklore. Though dutiful on ordinary drugs, he is gripped when it comes to the exotic or obscure. There are intriguing entries on socalled psychoactive animals. Apparently members of the Humr tribe in south-west Sudan dream vividly of giraffes after taking giraffe liver extract or bone marrow. What heroin taker would swap its orgasmic rush for a giraffe dream? As Mr Rudgley sweeps from soma of the ancient Indo-Iranians to Ecstasy in the British rave scene, he is careful always to put his psychoactive substances into a wider cultural or even ritual context, an aspect that has been largely lost in Western drug use. 
A quick fix 
Common to many of these books is the charge that American administrations have tended to neglect solid evidence which might ease their drug bind. This is most obvious with marijuana, which 7om Americans over the age of 12 have tried, some for medical reasons, but most for fun. Since the 193os, blue-ribbon panels of scientists and doctors have urged its decriminalisation, only to meet rebuttal from influential voices, like Anslinger, that marijuana was a ""gateway"" substance leading users to more damaging drugs such as heroin. Yet the evidence to support marijuana's ""gateway"" status is remarkably thin. Marijuana is not benign. There are legitimate concerns about its effect on memory and on the lungs, among other organs. But by most clinical (and personal) accounts, the drug is no more dangerous than alcohol, a freely-flowing intoxicant. 
Yet marijuana policy in America does appear to be softening. Half a dozen states have voted to legalise the drug for medical purposes. By contrast, the tough official policy on hard drugs shows little sign of change. Nor do the anti-drug-war doves air pear to be making much headway in winning converts where it counts-among elected politicians and in the criminal-justice system. Part of the trouble is that the anti-war camp is divided, not least on something seemingly as basic as the medical effects of hard drugs. This is not their fault: the issues are complex and the evidence is often disputable. Yet given the sheer weight of belief that hard drugs are very dangerous indeed, the burden of disproof rests, politically, on the doves. 
To take a glaring example of where wellinformed, fair-minded people can differ on what you might expect was observable fact: Mr Rudgley describes the bleak prospects of America's 375,ooo crack babies, born to addicted mothers, who face a life of mental and physical retardation. But Mr Gray claims that this figure is grossly exaggerated and that most crack babies grow up to be quite normal and not ""brain-damaged, unteachable monsters"". 
Any sensible approach to hard drugs ought to start with an understanding of addiction. But addiction, too, appears to be a bendable notion. Do drugs give addicts a habit or do addicts make a habit of drugs? Not everyone who takes a hard drug spirals into dependence. How destructive it is to be hooked depends a lot on your circumstances. Cocaine is most certainly addictive for some, but many users manage to limit their intake to the occasional snort. Heroin is much harder to take or leave. But addicts can regularise consumption and do jobs, as heroin-prescription programmes in Switzerland and Britain have shown. 
The best research seems to confirm most people's intuition that addiction depends on a damaging mix of biochemistry and bad social conditions. Much of this research is discussed in ""Buzzed"", a guide to the effects of legal and illicit drugs from coffee to cocaine. The authors wrote it out of concern for what they take to be a growing ""disconnect"" between advances in understanding of the physiology of addiction and public perceptions of drug abuse. ""Buzzed"" describes complex neurochemistry with admirable clarity and its glossary of drug terms will raise smiles. Roche may be a respectable Swiss pharmaceutical company. But ""Roche"" in street slang is Rohypnol, the notorious date-rape drug. ""Prudential"" has nothing to do with insurance but means a crack-user. ""Buzzed"" is less clear about how much cocaine or heroin you can take without risking addiction. This is not its fault. Even the best evidence on this has an elusive, it-depends quality: instant, one-off addiction is rare even with heroin, it seems, but repeated use over a few weeks or less can create dependence. Yes, but what is the connection between that first use and those few repeats? 
Denouncing the war on drugs is the easy part. Finding a different approach is trickier. The more radical anti-war doves believe in sweeping legalisation. Dirk Chase Eldredge is one such and he makes a fact-packed case in ""Ending the War on Drugs"". Unlike ""Drug Crazy"", which views the war from the trenches, this book reads more like a conference report from a chateau general. 
Yet the author is not what you might expect. Mr Eldredge is a life-long Republican and former campaign manager for President Reagan, whose wife, Nancy, sponsored ""Just Say No"". Within the party his is very much a minority view: most Republicans in Congress who speak out on the issue are unblinkingly pro-war and would like to see users and pushers off the streets for good. 
Undaunted, Mr Eldredge spells out how legalisation could be accomplished. His preferred system would include staterun sales, quality-and-price control and a ban on advertising. Revenue from drug sales and a ""peace dividend"" (fewer prisoners and crop eradications to pay for)would, he believes, provide money for anti-drug education, drug treatment and research. 
As a virgin-lands policy, this has strong appeal. Unfortunately, America is not virgin soil and Mr Eldredge's proposal is beset by several layers of difficulty. He himselfacknowledges the problem faced by the constitutional primacyof the states in criminal matters: repealing federal drug laws would do little good if states did not follow in concert. He imagines the black market that would persist if for example one state legalised while its neighbour continued to proscribe. 
A similar difficulty exists at the international level. America has signed several drug treaties that prohibit trade in narcotics and oblige countries to police its use. Either America must persuade much of the world to decriminalise, having spent decades cajoling or coercing other nations into adopting an opposite line. Or America must abrogate treaties and legalise unilaterally, a step which could turn it into a black-market drugs exporter. Politically, neither course looks appetising. 
A third problem is uncertainty about the use- and addiction-effects if cocaine and heroin were decriminalised. It may well be that some people will take drugs whatever the law says. Just as Mr Booth cites history, Mr Eldredge cites recent opinion polls in support of the view that drug laws have little visible effect on drug conduct. There are strict drug laws and most people do not take drugs. But to treat the second as a consequence of the first, he believes, is a mistake. The reasons people give for why they do not take drugs include all sorts of things-health effects, moral scruples, personal dislikes-but the law seldom figures highly among them. 
This is persuasive as far as it goes. But it skirts the main issue: how many people would try hard drugs if they were legally available, and how many new addicts would there be? Prohibitionists point to the Dutch experience. The partial decriminalisation of cannabis there was followed, they point out, by a sharp rise in use by teenagers. Increased availability, in other words, inevitably means some increased consumption. But the marijuana parallel is not relevant, many doves insist, since soft and hard drugs are so different. Cocaine and heroin, they seem to be saying, are their own best deterrent. 
The truth is nobody can say with any confidence what would happen if hard drugs were legalised. No country has yet dared to try and addiction research has not yet given firm enough answers. 
A middle way 
Not surprisingly, many people are looking for a middle way between the diehard warriors and the out-and-out legalisers. Last year, Foreign Affairs published an instructive exchange between Ethan Nadelmann, who favours harm-reduction for illegal hard drugs in a context of marijuana decriminalisation (""Commonsense Drug Policy"";January-February 1998 issue) and Herbert Kleber and Mitchell Rosenthal, who favour continued proscription but think money should also be invested in education, treatment and research on the home front (""Drug Myths from Abroad""; September-October 1998). 
In ""The Fix"", Michael Massing describes in detail one of America's few sustained attempts to relieve or cure addicts rather than punish them. Early in the 197os an estimated 600,ooo Americans regularly used heroin, a number swollen by addicted soldiers returning from Vietnam. President Nixon asked Jerome Jaffe, a psychiatrist from Chicago, to set up methadone centres and abstinence programmes across the country. At their height, such ""demandside"" initiatives received two-thirds of the federal drug budget, and made considerable gains: crime rates fell and fewer addicts died of overdoses. 
But as the heroin crisis abated, so did government interest in the Jaffe programmes. Subsequent administrations, Republican and Democratic, turned to ""sup ply-side"" controls abroad and to locking up users and pushers in America. Mr Massing is particularly critical of a shift in resources under Presidents Reagan and Bush from the dark heart of drug use-hard-core cocaine and heroin addiction-to teenage marijuana use. 
A few methadone treatment centres carry on Dr Jaffe's tradition, but they have room for only 15% of America's 800,ooo heroin addicts. ""The Fix"" takes to the street with one service, New York's Hot Line Cares, as it lives hand-to-mouth trying to get the city's crack addicts into precious treatment slots. The reward is found, not only in Mr Massing's accounts of wasted lives rescued through treatment, but also in hard economics. According to a 1992 study conducted by California's Rand Corporation, treatment is seven times better at reducing cocaine consumption in America than domestic law enforcement and an astonishing 23 times more effective than blasting foreign drug sources. Mr Massing advocates a rebalancing of the nation's drug budget, with half of its resources allocated to treatment and education, out of the pocket of supply-side control. Drug warriors certainly challenge this balance of power. An increased investment in treatment or harm reduction will not singlehandedly solve the drug problem. But at least they will not make matters worse, which the war on drugs very arguably has.  1999 FOR more than five years William Gaddis worked on his first novel, ""The Recognitions"", hoping for, and half expecting, instant success. He would not, he said later, have been ""terribly surprised"" to get the Nobel. Quick fame came to Scott Fitzgerald and Ernest Hemingway. Why not to him? Young writers know the feeling. But ""The Recognitions"" did not even receive the kindness usually accorded to first novels. Those critics that cared to review the book said it was a dud. ""Sprawling, squalling, overwritten,"" wrote one sadist. 
Twenty years later, in 1975, Mr Gaddis ventured to publish a second novel, ""J.R"". It received ecstatic reviews. It was ""inventive and subtle"", ""wildly satiric"", ""dazzling"". Swift himself would have been happy with it. Mr Gaddis became the recipient of numerous literary prizes. ""The Recognitions"" was judged, on rereading, to be one of the most important American novels of the past 50 years. 
How can critics make such a misjudgment? Quite easily, especially if, as in the case of Mr Gaddis's writing, there are a few problems. For one thing, his books are very long. ""The Recognitions"" runs to nearly 1,000 pages, a time-consuming read for a critic whose review has to be in by tomorrow. Then, much of the narrative is in the form of conversation, but without much punctuation to help it along. It is nearer in style to James Joyce than to Jackie Collins. But with a little effort you get used to it. Mr Gaddis was a gentle innovator and against what he called the ""originality of incompetent idiots"" who ""could not do a thing the right way"". He strove to get the right words in every sentence of his mammoth novels. ""There is an obligation not to bore or to be bored yourself,"" he said. 
In the years after Mr Gaddis's appalling start, those who take an interest in new writing had time to read his work and become ""dazzled"". By the time his second book came along, he had acquired, by word of mouth in America and Europe, a reputation as a writer worth watching. The critics, suitably forewarned, read ""J.R"" more carefully. 
The wizard of Wall Street 
""JR"" is about an ii-year-old boy who goes on a school trip to Wall Street and is given a single share in order to experience the charm of ""investing in America"". He invests so astutely that he takes control of a company and makes a fortune. ""The Recognitions"" is about a clergyman's son who becomes a painter. ""Carpenter's Gothic"" is about an evangelical clergyman with an interest in helping exploited people. ""A Frolic of His Own"", is about a motorist who figures out whom to sue after arranging his own car accident. They sound the sort of tales that might be turned into films about American life. But that depends on how you see America. The Disney-sounding financial prodigy is deemed, at ii, to have the mental age of the average American adult. He is without scruples and is motivated solely by greed. The painter becomes a forger and takes the view that everything in life is a fraud. The concerned clergyman epitomises human stupidity. The motorist finds himself caught in the absurdities of American law. 
Mr Gaddis gained a view of the practical world during the years when he was unable to make a living from literature. After leaving Harvard, where he edited the Harvard Lampoon, he had a number of casual jobs, among them checking facts for the New Yorker magazine and working on a lock in the Panama canal; later, more permanently, he was doing publicity for a pharmaceutical company, working on training films for the army and writing speeches for company executives. His speeches were admired for their wit and their elegant exposition of the aims of capitalism, a feature notably absent from ""J.R"", although Mr Gaddis once said that free enterprise, for all its doubtful morality, was the least-dangerous economic system yet devised. 
William Gaddis avoided personal publicity. He gave interviews only to literary magazines that few people read. The experiences of his varied life went into his books, not on to television. An acquaintance recalled seeing him at a writers' conference which was attended by Allen Ginsberg, a selfpublicising poet who declaimed his verse accompanied by an accordion he usually carried. Mr Gaddis, by contrast, ""spoke in measured tones of the small sales that the serious novelist might expect."" It was an austere view, a rejection of the general philosophy of the book trade, which is unconcerned about whether books are read as long as they are bought. 
Even after his critical acclaim, his sales remained modest. He could never be a Hemingway, who happily advertised his colourful life. He never wrote sentimentally about being an American in Paris. He had lived there for a time and dismissed it: ""Age cannot wither, nor custom stale, her infinite vulgarity."" William Gaddis published only four books. He left a fifth, called ""Agape Agape"". Its publication date has yet to be set. There is no hurry. His admirers are a patient lot.  1999 PRICES AND WAGES In November, 12-month consumer-price inflation in the euro-il countries fell slightly, to 0.9%. Danish inflation stayed at 1.7%. Canada's inflation rate edged up to 1.2%, and Japan's to 0.8%. Denmark's producer prices fell by 2.2% in the year to November. Italian workers received a 2.3% pay rise in the year to November, a real rise of 0.8%.  1999 COMMODITY PRICE INDEX 
Our all-items dollar index slumped by 16.5% in 1998 and is now at its lowest level for five years. Both industrial and food prices have been hit by falling demand in the wake of the Asian and Russian financial crises. The metals index has fallen by 45% from its peak in January 1995. A sustained recovery in metal prices is unlikely without cuts in output. Copper is at a lZ-year low, and nickel at an ii-year low. Soft commodity prices subsided as the El Nino weather system faded; the food index is now a third below its peak in May 1997. Surpluses pushed wheat prices to zo-year lows and sugar to ten-year lows.

On the night of February loth, members of a private army called Ranbir Sena shot dead 12 Dalits (formerly called untouchables) in a village not far from the state's capital, Patna. Four of the dead were women and one a 12-year-old girl. A fortnight earlier, in a village nearby, the same band, a militia formed by the land-owning Bhumihar caste, had slaughtered 22 Dalits. The latest outrage gave India's central government the excuse it needed to get rid of Bihar's populist leader, Laloo Prasad Yadav. On February 12th, it obliged the president to dismiss Bihar's government and the following day to dispatch some 16,ooo paramilitaries to restore order. 
If anywhere deserves the smack of direct rule it is Bihar, in eastern India, the country's second most populous state. Its loom people are India's poorest and least literate. They are also among the most violent. Kidnapping, armed robbery and extortion are major activities; many crimes go unreported because victims see the police as accomplices rather than protectors. 
""Harijan hunting""-to Mahatma Gandhi, untouchables were Harijans, people of God-is Bihar at its most horrifying. It is a sport of landowners who have come to fear their landless workers as much as they depend on them. The labourers are full of grievance: they accuse landlords of grabbing more land than the law allows, paying less than the minimum wage and taking their upper-caste status as a licence to rape. Their part has been taken by various Naxalite (radical communist) groups, which employ a mixture of social work, agitation and, sometimes, outright violence to defend them. They have grabbed land back and reduced some landlords to penury by boycotting their fields. Ranbir Sena is the latest in a series of private armies set up to intimidate the labourers and exact revenge. 
Such class warfare affects mainly central Bihar, which has starker inequalities than elsewhere in India. The rest of the state suffers more-ordinary criminality. Both sorts flourish because the state is so badly run that it cannot keep proper land records, let alone jail kidnappers and murderers. ""From top to bottom, the law is ap> plied discriminately,"" says Prabhakar Sinha, of the People's Union for Civil Liberties. Losers take the law into their own hands. 
Will central rule change that? In getting rid of Mr Yadav, the government has thrown out a rotten egg. For nine years he has presided over growing anarchy and a deteriorating economy. In 1997, after being charged with corruption, he resigned as chief minister but installed his wife as a figurehead while remaining head of his Rashtriya Janata party. Although Mr Yadav came to power by championing the ""backward castes"", his critics accuse him of switching sides. When it comes to fighting for power in Bihar, the Yadavs (the name also applies to a caste) are enemies of the upper castes. But they are also relatively rich and upwardly mobile. Pro-Dalit activists say the Yadavs have as little sympathy for them as the Bhumihars do. 
Direct rule has brought temporary power to Mr Yadav's political foes, the Bharatiya Janata Party(BJP), which leads the central government, and the Bihar-based Samata Party, one of the BJP's many coalition partners. Both draw much of their support from upper castes. As a result, ""none will dismantle the Ranbir Sena"", predicts P.V. Srinivas, an official of the Communist Party of India (Marxist-Leninist) Liberation, a Naxalite group. That may be too pessimistic. If both houses of the national Parliament ratify direct rule in Bihar, the government will dissolve the state assembly and hold new elections. To defeat Mr Yadav at the polls, the BJP and Samata parties must make direct rule work. Reports of mass arrests of Bhumihars in Jehanabad, scene of much of the worst violence, suggest the new administration is ready to be tough, if not fastidious. 
A successful crackdown would have other payoffs. The Samata Party's loyalty to the shaky government coalition has been secured, at least temporarily. The coalition should have a better chance of survival if the prime minister, Atal Behari Vajpayee, shows further signs of being able to govern. But squabbles have already broken out over the future of the governor of Bihar, Sundar Singh Bhandari, a former BJP vicepresident. On February i8th, there were reports that as many as six BJP lawmakers from Bihar had threatened to resign if Mr Bhandari were replaced. 
One happier development for Mr Vajpayee may come on February 2oth when, if all goes well, he will board the first passenger-carrying bus to Pakistan since 1965. But Bihar's problems cannot be solved by the truncheon alone. It will take years of enlightened government to replace feudalism with institutions that can deliver economic development and justice. None of the parties contending for power has proved it can provide that. ","BY BIHAR 'S awful standards , it was a medium - sized atrocity .

THERE was something for everyone in Atal Behari Vajpayee's visit to Pakistan last weekend. For sentimentalists, there was the stirring spectacle of an Indian prime minister crossing the border in a humble bus ennobled, South Asian-style, with a touch of gold. For cynics, there was a woolly declaration to debunk. For Islamic fundamentalists, there was a chance to rampage and terrify ambassadors. Most people were probably relieved that India and Pakistan, menacing each other with nuclear weapons for the past nine months, promised so ceremonially to resolve their differences. 
The Lahore declaration and two companion statements oblige neither country to do very much but talk some more. The firmest commitment, to inform the other when one side tests ballistic missiles, requires a treaty of its own to be made permanent. What makes the documents more than pleasant chatter is that taboos have been bent, though not broken. 
Starting in September, when he met his Pakistani counterpart, Nawaz Sharif, at the UN, Mr Vajpayee has edged closer than his predecessors to putting the issue of the disputed Muslim-majority state of Kashmir on the negotiating table. The Lahore declaration singles it out as the main obstacle to peace. No Indian prime minister, least of all the nationalist Mr Vajpayee, would dare suggest that it is anything other than a part of India. Yet, asked about Kashmiris' right to selfdetermination, Mr Vajpayee offered something other than the standard rebuff: ""Wait for the outcome of the talks."" 
It may also be progress that conventional as well as nuclear arms are to be included in working out ""confidence-building measures"" designed to reduce the risk of war. India's army is far stronger than Pakistan's and the gap is widening. India.is thought to be shopping for technology that could neutralise Pakistan's ability to detect a missile attack. The weaker its conventional forces become in relation to India's, the more tempted Pakistan will be to resort to a nuclear first strike. Reducing the threat from conventional weapons reduces the menace of nuclear ones, though the two countries have taken military ""confidencebuilding"" steps before, only to abandon them as rivalries intensified. 
Meanwhile, the Indians can also point to rhetorical victories. Promises to boost trade, ease travel restrictions and resolve minor border disputes represent a defeat for Pakistani hardliners, who want all progress held hostage to a settlement on Kashmir. The Lahore declaration reaffirms the 1972 Simla agreement, which Pakistan does not like because it seems to exclude outside mediators and makes no reference to UN resolutions stipulating a plebiscite in Kashmir. Yet the declaration is less an agreement than a curtain rod on which agreements can be hung. Now the two countries have to start weaving the drapery. 
Mr Sharif is to pay a return visit to India; the countries' two top foreign-service officers are to meet sooner, perhaps by early March. The swiftest progress should come where it is most needed, in steps to reduce the risk of nuclear war. The Lahore declaration appears to delink confidence-building proposals from the vexed Kashmir issue, even though that gets a mention. It promises ""immediate steps"" to reduce the risk of accidental use of nuclear weapons and other useful measures, such as improvements to the lines of communication between the countries' military chiefs. 
The rest of the agenda, which includes a dispute over the western sea border and a small war atop the Siachen glacier in the Himalayas, is no less important to durable peace. But Kashmir is the biggest stumbling-block. Khalid Mahmud, of the Institute of Regional Studies in Islamabad, says Pakistan will not resolve border disputes and the like until India stops insisting that Kashmir is an integral part of India. Mr Vajpayee's conciliatory noises in Lahore did not go that far, he notes. 
That is true. The bonho mie in Lahore did not give India's prime minister licence to suggest that India's sovereignty over Kashmir was negotiable. Nor can Mr Sharif be seen to betray Muslim Kashmiris by making peace with India over their heads. That still leaves room to reduce tensions in the territory. Pakistan could give less aid and comfort to the insurgents who periodically massacre Kashmiri Hindus. India could respond by withdrawing some of its half a million troops from Kashmir. 
As it is, bus diplomacy faces opposition enough. Members of the Jamaat-i-Islami, a fundamentalist Islamic party, harassed visiting dignitaries on February 2oth, and were tear-gassed by police at a peaceful meeting the next day. The commanders of Pakistan's armed forces were less than enthusiastic: rather than greet Mr Vajpayee at the border they kept a previous engagement with China's defence minister in Islamabad. Soldiers and Islamists also hap pen to be the two groups that might topple Mr Sharif if Pakistan's gasping economy gets any worse. Mr Vajpayee is getting an easier ride from India's right, in part because most of it is associated with his own nationalist party. But that could change if he started making real concessions, and no one knows how long his shaky coalition will survive. 
Yet both prime ministers have ample reason to press on. Mr Sharif, who faces stiffer resistance, has the bigger incentive. Any help from rich countries for Pakistan's economy depends largely on progress in peacemaking. Mr Vajpayee wants to repair his relations with the United States, which has yet to lift all the sanctions it imposed after last May's nuclear tests. 
The two prime ministers have apparently convinced each other that India and Pakistan need no longer be enemies; now they must convince their countrymen. The best thing about Mr Vajpayee's bus trip is that it may have begun to win them over. ","Even Kashmir is mentioned as India and Pakistan seek to break taboos

Yet , asked about Kashmiris ' right to selfdetermination , Atal Bihari Vajpayee offered something other than the standard rebuff : "" Wait for the outcome of the talks . "" 
 It may also be progress that conventional as well as nuclear arms are to be included in working out "" confidence - building measures "" designed to reduce the risk of war . India 's army is far stronger than Pakistan 's and the gap is widening . India.is thought to be shopping for technology that could neutralise Pakistan 's ability to detect a missile attack . The weaker its conventional forces become in relation to India 's , the more tempted Pakistan will be to resort to a nuclear first strike . Reducing the threat from conventional weapons reduces the menace of nuclear ones , though the two countries have taken military "" confidencebuilding "" steps before , only to abandon them as rivalries intensified . 
 Meanwhile , the Indians can also point to rhetorical victories . Promises to boost trade , ease travel restrictions and resolve minor border disputes represent a defeat for Pakistani hardliners , who want all progress held hostage to a settlement on Kashmir . The Lahore declaration reaffirms the 1972 Simla agreement , which Pakistan does not like because it seems to exclude outside mediators and makes no reference to UN resolutions stipulating a plebiscite in Kashmir . Yet the declaration is less an agreement than a curtain rod on which agreements can be hung . Now the two countries have to start weaving the drapery . 
 Mr Sharif is to pay a return visit to India ; the countries ' two top foreign - service officers are to meet sooner , perhaps by early March . The swiftest progress should come where it is most needed , in steps to reduce the risk of nuclear war . The Lahore declaration appears to delink confidence - building proposals from the vexed Kashmir issue , even though that gets a mention . It promises "" immediate steps "" to reduce the risk of accidental use of nuclear weapons and other useful measures , such as improvements to the lines of communication between the countries ' military chiefs . 
 The rest of the agenda , which includes a dispute over the western sea border and a small war atop the Siachen glacier in the Himalayas , is no less important to durable peace . But Kashmir is the biggest stumbling - block . Khalid Mahmud , of the Institute of Regional Studies in Islamabad , says Pakistan will not resolve border disputes and the like until India stops insisting that Kashmir is an integral part of India . Atal Bihari Vajpayee's conciliatory noises in Lahore did not go that far , he notes . 
 That is true . The bonho mie in Lahore did not give Atal Bihari Vajpayee's licence to suggest that India 's sovereignty over Kashmir was negotiable . Nor can Mr Sharif be seen to betray Muslim Kashmiris by making peace with India over their heads . That still leaves room to reduce tensions in the territory . Pakistan could give less aid and comfort to the insurgents who periodically massacre Kashmiri Hindus . India could respond by withdrawing some of its half a million troops from Kashmir . 
 As it is , bus diplomacy faces opposition enough . Members of the Jamaat - i - Islami , a fundamentalist Islamic party , harassed visiting dignitaries on February 2oth , and were tear - gassed by police at a peaceful meeting the next day . The commanders of Pakistan 's armed forces were less than enthusiastic : rather than greet Atal Bihari Vajpayee at the border they kept a previous engagement with China 's defence minister in Islamabad . Soldiers and Islamists also hap pen to be the two groups that might topple Mr Sharif if Pakistan 's gasping economy gets any worse . Atal Bihari Vajpayee is getting an easier ride from India 's right , in part because most of it is associated with Atal Bihari Vajpayee's own nationalist party . But that could change if Atal Bihari Vajpayee started making real concessions , and no one knows how long Atal Bihari Vajpayee's shaky coalition will survive . 
 Yet both prime ministers have ample reason to press on . Mr Sharif , who faces stiffer resistance , has the bigger incentive . Any help from rich countries for Pakistan 's economy depends largely on progress in peacemaking . Atal Bihari Vajpayee wants to repair Atal Bihari Vajpayee's relations with the United States , which has yet to lift all the sanctions it imposed after last May 's nuclear tests . 
 The two prime ministers have apparently convinced each other that India and Pakistan need no longer be enemies ; now they must convince their countrymen . The best thing about Atal Bihari Vajpayee's bus trip is that it may have begun to win them over .",750,India,A29-8257,IN TERM,True,Atal Behari Vajpayee 's,18,True

MORE important than the financial details of India's budget is its political message. It signals a shift away from the philosophy of last year's budget, which sought to take India back into the protectionist cocoon of swadeshi (self-sufficiency). The liberal-minded wing of the ruling coalition is now calling the shots, and this makes for better politics as well as economics. 
The budget on February 27th raised income and corporate taxes by one-tenth in an effort to curb the budget deficit. The finance minister, Yashwant Sinha, simultaneously gave generous tax breaks for unit trusts (mutual funds) and housing, and cut interest rates to stimulate industry. This mixed bag helped to send the stockmarket soaring 15% in three days (see chart). Among the buyers were foreign investors who had expected little from the budget. 
The shift from swadeshi has been going on for some time. The industry minister, Sikander Bakht, has refused to curb foreign investment of any kind, even in fast-food outlets, which hardline nationalists regard as a threat to Indian culture (McDonald's and other American chains have come in for most criticism). In opposition, the Bharatiya Janata Party (Bjp) had fought proposals to allow foreign investment in the insurance industry, just as it had opposed plans to tighten patent law to protect international companies. But in December, the BJP, which now leads the ruling coalition, proposed bills to allow foreigners to hold up to 26% of Indian insurance companies, and to strengthen the patent law. This reversal caused a major row between the moderates, headed by the prime minister, Atal Behari Vajpayee, and the hardliners, but the liberals prevailed. Both bills are expected to become law soon. 
Mr Sinha has promised an expanded list of industries for which there is automatic permission for foreign investment, and for other industries where a decision is promised within 30 days. A new foreigninvestment authority, which will include state-government officials, will try to translate approvals into factories more quickly. However, many procedural hassles remain for foreigners investing in infrastructure. The top import duty is down from 45% to 4o%, but various intermediate rates have edged up, so the total take will go up a bit. Defence spending is projected to rise ii% next year, slower than nominal GNP. Actual spending tends to exceed budget estimates, but there is no sign of a defence spending spree after last year's nuclear test. 
The BJP needs the support of almost loo other Mps for a parliamentary majority, so it is hostage to constant demands from its coalition partners. Last year, Mr Sinha was forced to withdraw so many budget proposals in response to coalition pressures that he was nicknamed Rollback Sinha. This time he has crafted his budget to avoid antagonising any strong lobbies, such as trade unions and farmers. No rollbacks this time, he promises. However, weaknesses remain. Mr Sinha could have cut staff(the railways alone are estimated to have 500,ooo surplus workers). 
Given the fragility of the coalition, Mr Sinha's room for manoeuvre has been limited. Indeed, a week ago it seemed the government might fall. It had issued a decree sacking the Bihar state government for its failure to stem the slaughter of low-caste labourers by private armies of landowners, and imposed direct rule from Delhi. The decree needed ratification by Parliament, and the BJP thought it could count on the support of the Congress party, which has also been critical of the state government. But suddenly Congress decided to vote against direct rule, making ratification impossible in the upper house, where the coalition has barely 35% of the seats. Even in the lower house, several of the BJP's allies threatened to vote against the decree. 
Nevertheless, Mr Vajpayee pressed on, daring his allies to bring down the government. In the end they all relented. It was a big victory for the prime minister, who showed he had the courage to stand up to bullying, though he will lose when the matter goes to the upper house. This toughness has changed the political climate. Some say it means that instead of a fragile government on the brink of collapse, India now has a government that looks like lasting. ","DELHI

But this week the nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party(BjP)saw its main coalition partner withdraw its two representatives from the cabinet as the row over the sacking grew worse. The government now risks a no-confidence motion when Parliament reconvenes on April 15th. 
Admiral Bhagwat was sacked after he refused to accept the govemment's choice for the post of his deputy. In late February, he publicly claimed that his dismissal was politically motivated. He also accused the defence minister, George Fernandes, of pandering to an arms lobby and having sympathies for rebel groups. This week Mr Fernandes hit back, accusing the admiral of, among other things, leaking details of a secret defence project. 
The government fumbled the issue from the start. It ignored repeated skirmishes between the defence minister and the admiral, even though they began soon after it came to power just over a year ago. It dismissed Admiral Bhagwat without giving him a hearing and declined to divulge full details, citing national security. Since Admiral Bhagwat went public with his accusations, it has refused demands for a parliamentary inquiry. 
Now the All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazagham (AIADMK), a small party from the state of Tamil Nadu, is saying that the government must back down and hold an inquiry. It also wants the defence minister sacked and Admiral Bhagwat reinstated. The AIADMK has only i8 seats in the 545-seat Parliament, but the BJP has relied on it to help shore up its slim majority. After removing its two members from the cabinet, the AI.DMK now threatens to withdraw its support completely unless the government agrees to its demands. 
Whether it will attempt to bring down the government is unclear. The AK'S leader, Jayalalitha Jayaram, is a controversial former actress who has threatened such action before only to withdraw after winning concessions. This time, however, the prime minister, Atal Behari Vajpayee, seems adamant that he will not give in. He says he is prepared to face a no-confidence vote even without the support of the AIADMK. BJP officials are casting around for new allies and hope to attract the support of other small parties. 
If they fail and the government does fall, the president could ask the opposition Congress party to form a government. Smelling blood, Congress insists on an inquiry into the admiral's allegations. Its leader, Sonia Gandhi, met Miss Jayalalitha at a well-publicised tea party last week. Although this has fuelled speculation that a Congress-led government could be in the making, some analysts believe Congress would rather try to make life as uncomfortable as possible for the BJP for a while yet until its chances of an outright victory in a general election improve. 
If the government does survive, its next job will be to repair the morale of the armed forces. Unlike their counterparts in neighbouring countries, India's generals have never posed a challenge to democracy and enjoy widespread public confidence. After Admiral Bhagwat's dismissal, several retired military chief have added their voices to the concerns about politicians' increased meddling in military appointments and arms procurement.

WHEN India test-fired an upgraded version of its Agni missile on April 11th, Pakistan had a choice of responses: either to make a strong complaint to its neighbour, or to fire a missile of its own to remind India that it too had the latest weapons of war. Simply complaining was a temptation for Pakistan's prime minister, Nawaz Sharif His restraint would have been applauded by the outside world, especially America. Perhaps a few extra millions of dollars might have been forthcoming from donors to help his faltering economy. 
But Mr Sharif, like most political leaders, is mainly concerned to protect his back at home. There are peaceniks in Pakistan, but not many. The army is hawkish, as are some Islamic extremists. They are suspicious that Mr Sharif is becoming too friendly towards Pakistan's old enemy. Not everyone approved of a new bus service between the two countries, inaugurated by the Indian prime minister, Atal Behari Vajpayee. The summer months ahead are likely to see more exchanges of artillery fire in the disputed region of Kashmir. 
Mr Sharif chose the macho option, and launched two missiles. On April 14th, from a site near the city of Jehlum, south of Islamabad, Pakistan test-fired a version of its Ghauri missile. The weapon flew for 12 minutes at a distance of about 1,400km (875 miles), though officials quickly pointed out that its potential range was 2,300km. The following day Pakistan launched a shorter-range Shaheen missile. The upgraded Ghauri is Pakistan's longestrange weapon that could carry a nuclear warhead, and is capable of hitting cities deep inside India. 
The two countries told each other in advance of the tests, in keeping with an agreement to ease tension signed by their respective prime ministers in Lahore in February. But Pakistan was peeved that it was merely included in India's list of notified countries, among them the United States, Russia, China, Britain and France. Pakistan felt that it should have been notified ahead of the others. India, though, suspected that Pakistan would have tipped off America, which would then have leant on the Indians to stop the test. Quite possibly. 
Last year both countries carried out tests on nuclear weapons. Now they have publicly demonstrated that they are capable of delivering such weapons to their enemy's heartland. For Pakistan especially, the cost of the subcontinent's arms race is becoming unbearable. More than a quarter of the budget goes towards defence. The central bank is gloomy about current prospects for economic growth in the wake of a cotton crop failure. The Karachi stock market was depressed following news of the missile tests. The market fears that the country's jingoism will deter investors. 
Mr Sharif seems unwilling to bolster the economy by doing the logical thing and taxing the politically powerful landowners or using a sales tax to get round tax evasion by businesses. Some macho action here would do no harm. ","Pakistan

Bad government is too readily accepted in India. It is frequently shrugged off by Indians as an inevitable consequence of democracy. In truth, it is a consequence of incompetent and often corrupt politicians. 
Thus neither of India's two main parties-the Bharatiya Janata Party (led by the outgoing prime minister, Atal Behari Vajpayee) and the Congress party (led by Sonia Gandhi-argues for the kind of liberal economic change that the country has for so long been denied. Neither has the courage to tell the voters that India needs to devise ways to collect taxes, slash red tape, privatise state industries, encourage foreign investment, free its labour markets, reorganise its banks, lay off civil servants by the thousand, legislate to allow a widespread restructuring of industry-and, moreover, to do it all fast. 
Yet all is not hopeless. Though the sJP-led government has wasted most of the past 13 months congratulating itself that India has not been much affected by East Asia's economic turmoil (no wonder, given the economy's lack of integration with the outside world), it has belatedly started to offer some useful reforms. In doing so, it has abandoned most of the Hindu-nationalist nostrums of swadeshi (self-reliance) that it used to proclaim. However, Congress, though it includes one influential reformer in Manmohan Singh, its current leader in Parliament, is generally addicted to the interventionist economics of the Nehru-Gandhi dynasty, and its likely partners on the left are ideologically more hostile to economic liberalisation than the mostly regional parties that have governed in coalition with the BJP. If Congress is to show that it can act for the country as a whole, not just for interest-groups, it will have to embrace reform wholeheartedly. 
The BJP, too, has to show that it can be a national, not a narrow, sectarian party. The danger now is that the BJP's hardline zealots will argue that the collapse of the government proves the relatively moderate social and economic policies of the past 13 months to have been a failure. They will argue in opposition for a return to the programme of Hindutva (one all-encompassing culture), raising the spectre once again of anti-Muslim and anti-Christian rioting. 
For the rest of the world, and especially for India's neighbours, the main concern is the future of India's newly tested nuclear deterrent. That Mr Vajpayee has reopened a dialogue with Pakistan is welcome, especially if it leads to increased trade and therefore reduced tension. But it is plain that no new government in India (nor therefore in Pakistan) will abandon the bomb. India's next government could, however, do something to allay fears by swiftly signing the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty. There should be no reward for this, least of all a permanent seat on the UN Security Council (that would be an incentive to every country with the same ambition to go nuclear). India's signature would, however, show that it intended to be a good international citizen, which in turn would build confidence, encourage foreign investment and open the country to the wider world from which it has been too long too insulated. India would then find itself accepted, as it often says it wants to be, at the world's top tables. ","Though government instability seems permanent in India , it need not mean political paralysis

Lately, though, the prime minister, Atal Behari Vajpayee, had got a grip. He went on a dramatic peace-making journey to Pakistan. His finance minister presented a budget that did not attract the expected ridicule. Attacks on Christians, inspired if not encouraged by the BJP's right-wing affiliates, had died down. The awful prospect loomed that a popular prime minister might impart some of his popularity to his party and its allies, depriving the opposition of a chance at power for years to come. And so, on April 17th, the plug was pulled. 
What happens now, in a Parliament with nearly 50 parties and independents that felled a government by just one vote, is hard to predict. By mid-week, Congress, the second-largest party with 140 seats in the 545-member lower house, claimed to have enough backing to form a minority government. But several prospective allies were balking; they want a share of power, either as junior members of a Congress-led coalition or as a government that Congress would support from the outside. Neither option appeals to Congress. Its message to potential backers seemed to be: let us rule alone, or face a general election. In the impossible arithmetic of Parliament, nothing, not even a comeback by the BJP, can be ruled out. 
If Congress governs alone, the likely, but far from certain, prime minister will be the party's leader, Italian-born Sonia Gandhi, a political novice with no claim to high office other than as the widow of Rajiv Gandhi, a former prime minister assassinated in 1991. Some of the parties she would depend upon for support have even less reason to make the government look good than did Mr Vajpayee's obstreperous allies. A coalition with them would be even more uncomfortable. Congress had wanted its next turn in power to signal its return as the natural party of government. It could also prove Congress's final undoing. 
Congress had been playing a long game. Mrs Gandhi became its leader last year, restoring to Congress the aura of India's greatest political dynasty. Congress triumphed in state elections last November and was regaining support among Muslims and lower-caste voters in Uttar Pradesh, India's biggest state. The plan was to let Mr Vajpayee's government stagger on, win more state elections and in early 2ooo engineer a new general election and supplant the BJP as the biggest party. 
The fall of Mr Vajpayee's government has scuppered that plan. It is not clear whether that was by accident or whether the ""68-year-olds with bypasses"", as one Congressman calls the party elders, were tempted by a quick return to power. With Mr Vajpayee's government showing signs of life, Mrs Gandhi intensified her flirtation with its most disgruntled member, Jayaram Jayalalitha, a former film star who commands 18 Mps from the southern state of Tamil Nadu. Miss Jayalalitha took that as a sign to withdraw her support from the government, which promptly fell. 
Can Congress, with just a quarter of the seats in Parliament, govern without wrecking its credibility with an electorate that delights in toppling incumbents? Mrs Gandhi's task would be in some ways harder than that faced by Mr Vajpayee. Most of his 17 unruly allies were not intense competitors for power in state and national elections. Any Congress government in the current Parliament would depend on parties which Congress must weaken if it is ever to regain anything approaching a majority. There is an ideological affinity: Congress and most of its allies are resolutely ""secular"". But that is part of the difficulty. Congress is selling virtually the same wares to the same voters as many of its putative allies. As a national party, Congress likes to bill itself proudly as the secularist department store; its competitors are boutiques. 
No one is more worried than Mulayam Singh Yadav, chief of the zo-strong Samajwadi Party, which serves the sort of customers Congress goes after (Muslims and lower castes) in a state (Uttar Pradesh) where Congress is desperate to expand. Mr Yadav, whose support is vital, is determined to be part of the next government, with or without Congress. 
But Mrs Gandhi also needs various leftwing parties, some of which are Congress's electoral enemies and all of which reject its record of tepid economic liberalisation. Then there is the irrepressible Miss Jayalalitha, whose demands have ranged from the unreasonable (shifting the court that would try her for corruption) to the impossible (dismissing the government of her home state, Tamil Nadu). 
No one expects any set-up constructed from the sitting Parliament to last for long. The main business of its architects will be to outwit one another in preparation for the election that will follow its collapse. For Mrs Gandhi, if she becomes prime minister, that will mean coming down to earth but somehow remaining above the mire. Until now she has been all mystique: bride in a family of martyrs, patroness of the disadvantaged, goddess of Indian secularism. Meanwhile, reticence (she rarely gives interviews) has kept light from falling upon the mystery. 
A spell in government would raise those blinds. One potentially troublesome issue was disposed of when, to the relief of the financial markets, Parliament passed the budget of the outgoing government unchanged on April 22nd. That leaves plenty of hazards. There are bills pending to open up insurance to foreign competition and confer patent protection on foreign-invented pharmaceuticals, both of which are reviled by the left. There is the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty, which Mr Vajpayee was moving towards signing. Congress says America and Russia should ratify it first, which could mean a long delay. 
The next prime minister will also have the tricky task of making war and peace with Pakistan simultaneously. That will be doubly difficult if melting snows draw armed separatists into Indian-controlled Kashmir from the Pakistani-controlled part of the disputed state and heavy firing resumes across the line of control. Most of these issues bear in some way on India's relations to the outside world. An avowed nationalist, Mr Vajpayee had more flexibility in dealing with them than the foreign-born Mrs Gandhi might. 
A short lifespan for her first government might be Mrs Gandhi's best hope. She might have enough time to do a few popular things-increase spending on the poor, say, or give primary education a boost, without confronting the knotty issues of economic reform. By the next election, the BJP's best vote-getter, Mr Vajpayee, now 72, might decide not to run. Meanwhile, Mrs Gandhi could burnish Congress's credentials as the only party capable of standing up to the BJP. This is what Mr Yadav and his supporters are afraid of and why they are loth to give Congress a chance to govern on its own. If they do, it will be because they think Congress is more vulnerable in government than on the hustings. ","Congress wants to form India 's next government , but the outlook is uncertain .

In other words, will they vote for Italian-born Sonia Gandhi, widow of a former prime minister, Rajiv Gandhi, who waited more than a decade after her marriage to take out Indian citizenship? Or will they again choose Atal Behari Vajpayee, the (never married) BJP's outgoing prime minister, who is nothing if not a patriot and has exploded five nuclear bombs to prove it? 
It is true that either the Christian widow or the Brahmin bachelor is likely to become the next prime minister. But the incendiary notion that the choice is essentially between a native and a foreigner suggests a political atmosphere more over-heated than it really is. In fact, India's political parties do not disagree deeply about ideology. The election will take place because they felt free in the last parliament to make and break alliances as their whims and parochial calculations dictated. At the ballot box the BjP and Congress will compete to offer stability. The winner may be the party that convinces voters they will not soon have to vote again. 
The outgoing parliament lasted 13 months, making it the shortest-lived in India's history. With only a third of the seats in the 545-member lower house, the BJP had to govern at the head of a fractious 18party alliance. Mrs Gandhi's Congress party, the second-largest, had a quarter of the seats. The president dissolved Parliament on April 26th because, after one party pulled out of the BJP's coalition for narrow political reasons, the opposition parties could not agree on an alternative government for similar reasons. The president is hoping that the next parliament will have one party big enough to be really in charge. The winner will probably still need allies, although it will hope to have fewer and more reliable ones. 
Congress and the BJP will both fight for the centre ground. The Bjp will let its ideological affiliates bash Mrs Gandhi for being a foreigner, but does not want to be accused of bashing anyone else. In general, the party's Hindu-nationalist ideology will be little in evidence. The party may suspend its past manifesto, which calls for the building of a Hindu temple in Ayodhya, where Hindu zealots tore down a mosque in 1992, and other inflammatory measures. If the party's executive gives its approval, it may team up with several of its coalition partners and fight the election on the basis of the National Agenda for Governance, the unobjectionable document used to underpin its past 13 months in office. 
That strategy assumes that Mr Vajpayee's personal popularity, combined with outrage among India's 6oom voters at the manner of his defeat, will overcome the usual hostility to incumbent governments. The last time public opinion was tested, in four state elections in November, the BJP suffered a humiliating defeat at Congress's hands. That had a lot to do with the price of onions, which had shot up then and has since come down. Yogendra Yadav, a psephologist at the Centre for the Study of Developing Societies in Delhi, thinks the mood is still anti-Bjp. Its leaders ""promised government different from 50 years of governance. That is what they failed to deliver."" 
Congress hopes that sentiment still holds, and will offer itself as the real party of stable government. Some voters will back Congress as the party that ruled postindependence India and for the family that has given the country three prime ministers. But Indians are not so nostalgic that Congress can expect to have a majority on its own. It is already signing up allies. 
The most important and least predictable battle-ground will be Uttar Pradesh, the biggest state, which sent no Congress MPS to the last parliament. Congress wants to recapture upper-caste voters, who are thought to be disgruntled at the way the BJP has ruled there, and Muslims, who lost faith in Congress as the protector of minorities and champion of ""secularism"". They have been voting for the Samajwadi Party of Mulayam Singh Yadav. It was CongressSamajwadi rivalry that failed to extend the last parliament: Mr Yadav refused to back a minority Congress government. 
The outcome of the election will depend in part on when it is held. The decision could be made on May 3rd. The BJP wants an early poll, fearing that sympathy for its fallen prime minister will wane. If it is held in the autumn, other issues may loom large. One will be the performance of the BJP led caretaker government. It will no doubt use what powers it has to give sops to the voters, but convention dictates that caretakers take no long-term decisions. On two measures of keen interest to outsiders it probably cannot act: allowing foreigners to enter the insurance market and signing the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty.

SOME said it would be a presidential election. A popular prime minister, Atal Behari Vajpayee, was up against Sonia Gandhi, bearer of India's most revered political name. Now Mrs Gandhi has been wounded, perhaps fatally, not by her rivals but by her supposed friends. Three senior members of her Congress party wrote a letter making the point her opponents have been making since a general election was called earlier this month: that somebody born in Italy is not Indian enough to be prime minister. It became public on May i6th, and on the same day she resigned as head of the party. 
She may not mean it. Many people think she will come back, after sufficiently loudprotestations of loyalty from her followers. The chief ministers of the four Congressgoverned states and most members of the party's top policymaking body have offered their resignations, saying they do not want to return until she does. Yet even if Mrs Gandhi relents, Congress will find it hard to recover in time for an election in the autumn. 
Mrs Gandhi took over Congress a year ago, after it had lost to Mr Vajpayee's Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) in the last general election. She apparently quelled its internal strife, won back disaffected Muslim voters and re-established Congress as the main foe of the Hindu nationalism espoused by the BjP. In November, Congress beat the Bjp in three state elections, which made the party think it could do the same at the centre. 
These achievements are now in jeopardy. The rebellion's ring-leader is Sharad Pawar, leader of the opposition in the lower house until it was dissolved last month and once the youngest ever chief minister of an Indian state. He remains the pre-eminent ""secular"" politician in Maharashtra, which Congress had counted on winning in the forthcoming election. He was never a favourite of Mrs Gandhi, but was too brainy and powerful to be sidelined. 
Gandhi loyalists paint Mr Pawar's revolt as the tantrum of a frustrated underling, a ""cynical, low-down kind of move"", as a party spokesman put it. But it is more than that. It suggests that, in Mr Pawar's view, Congress's renaissance ended with its failure last month to form a government after helping to engineer the collapse of Mr Vajpayee's coalition. The episode made Congress look like the creature of old-timers willing to sacrifice its credibility for a last grab at power. Mr Pawar had little hand in it. 
His betrayal is also a challenge to the popular view that India's fragmented party system is sorting itself into two fronts, one based on Congress, the other on the BJP. Mr Pawar is evidently ready to risk expulsion from his party if that is the price he must pay to be a big shot from Maharashtra, making and breaking (and perhaps even leading) central governments as other regional bosses have been doing. His rebellion has given new heart to the ""third front""-the group of mostly leftish parties that love neither Congress nor the BJP. 
If Mrs Gandhi's resignation is not withdrawn, Congress may have to resign itself to defeat in the election. It has no one else to compete with Mr Vajpayee's national appeal, and will no doubt revert to grubby infighting in her absence. Even if she returns, Congress's task has become harder. It is uncertain whether Mr Pawar can remain in the party, and difficult to see Congress winning in Maharashtra without him. Unless it secures a big chunk of the state's 48 seats in the 545-member Parliament, Congress will be hard pressed to force the BJP into second place, let alone to win a majority. Peacemakers in the party are struggling to hold on both to Maharashtra and to Mrs Gandhi. 
The BJP primly observes that the dispute is an internal Congress matter, but can barely hide its delight. The party has made itself ideologically innocuous by forming a ""National Democratic Alliance"" with several of its coalition partners. It plans to fight the election on a common manifesto free of the minority-baiting ideas that alienated many voters in previous elections. But the multiheaded alliance has still looked vulnerable to Congress's claim that it could give more decisive leadership. With Congress's main leaders now either in rebellion or, at least temporarily, in retirement, voters would have to be credulous indeed to buy that.

Wearing an expression of patriotic hauteur, a red-crowned border guard from each side marches towards the other with perfect synchrony, lowers his national flag and furls it, hoping to outdo the other in speed and precision. This prickly display, reminiscent of a stand-off between peacocks, is a symbol of kinship between the two countries that used to be one. But it is also a reminder that their bloody partition, their three wars and their continuing quarrel over Kashmir remain unforgotten. Their common border is meant to be contemplated rather than crossed. 
Until recently, at least. On February 2oth India's then prime minister (and now caretaker pending elections due in the autumn), Atal Behari Vajpayee, crossed the Punjabi customs post in a gold-coloured bus to meet his Pakistani opposite number, Nawaz Sharif. That bus journey launched a regular service between Delhi, India's capital, and Lahore, the capital of Pakistani Punjab, aimed at encouraging ordinary traffic in people, goods and ideas between estranged neighbours that now brandish nuclear weapons. Whatever their differences, Mr Vajpayee and Mr Sharif promised, they would be settled peacefully. 
That promise seemed to pull India and Pakistan out of a subcontinental tail-spin. Their tit-for-tat nuclear tests in May 1998 had brought them opprobrium and economic sanctions, but they had also made the world sit up and notice them. Although South Asia's seven countries have a population larger than China's, and the biggest concentration of English-speakers outside the United States, their low levels of income and literacy had made them easy to ignore. When people still talked about the Asian century, they rarely thought of South Asiaand when they did, few were optimistic about it. 
South Asia seems one of the likelier places on earth for some sort of Armageddon-if not caused by a nuclear explosion, then perhaps by some population or environmental bomb. Lesser cataclysms happen all the time. Violence, or the threat of it, is part of the ambient noise. Ghazi Salahuddin, a Pakistani journalist, calls India and Pakistan ""two jinxed countries"". 
Mr Vajpayee's bus trip lightened the mood. It made nuclear war seem less likely and offered hope that India and Pakistan would end a rivalry that has distorted the development of both countries. Mr Vajpayee and Mr Sharif seemed to be saying notjust ""Let's be friends"" but also ""Let's be normal."" 
This survey is about the prospects for normality in South Asia's two most populous countries. Normality, of course, is a loaded word. As Samuel Huntington famously argued, what is normal in the West may not be normal in other civilisations. And civilisation is a word that means a lot in India and Pakistan. India's multi-layered culture has a literary and religious history stretching back to the Rig Veda, written about 3,000 years ago; Pakistan has that, plus a national commitment to Islam. These traditions blended and clashed and bumped into others, producing achievements and sensibilities shared with no other part of the world. The last thing India and Pakistan want is the sort of normality that would wash their civilisations away. 
What they do need, this survey will argue, is a normality of norms. These norms are few, basic and ought to be universal, but India and Pakistan have trampled on them too often, compromising the lives and welfare of their people. They include abjuring violence, starting from the assumption that people are equal, and distinguishing public duty from private preference. Both countries are beset by violence, inequality and corruption. 
Such sweeping assertions require immediate qualification. Anything you say about two countries with a total of 1.1 billion people, especially two as diverse as these, will be wrong much of the time for many of the people. It is natural to allow headlines to sum up a place, but in India and Pakistan it is more often than usually wrong. 
All their fault 
To what extent should India and Pakistan blame their woes on each other? They achieved independence and separation in searing circumstances. India's founding fathers, Mohandas Gandhi and Jawaharlal Nehru, were Hindus but wanted India to be a tolerant country embracing all its many religions and peoples. Muhammad Ali Jinnah, Pakistan's founder, did not trust them. India's Muslims, he thought, could achieve equal rights and dignity only in their own homeland. The departing British carved India into Muslim- and Hindu-majority states, bisecting Punjab and Bengal and creating a Pakistan of nearly equal parts a thousand miles apart. It was a bloody business. Muslims in Pakistan turned on Hindus and Sikhs; Hindus and Sikhs in India slaughtered their Muslim neighbours; and victims on both sides retaliated. In all, perhaps a million people died and 17m fled to whichever state offered them the security of majority status. 
South Asians have tried to forget this unforgettable event, says Ashis Nandy, an Indian scholar who is rescuing its memory by recording the testimony of witnesses. ""There is a tremendous silence, and yet it informs public life at every stage."" This is true in some obvious ways. Pakistan devotes a crushing share of its resources to defence, mainly against the threat from India. Pakistan has been on a war footing all its life, and has been ruled by military governments for nearly half of its 52 years. India's obsession with Pakistan is less intense, and its effect on the country's evolution has been subtler. Ayesha Jalal, an historian, argues controversially that the Indian National Congress, which ejected the British from India and ruled the country for most of its first so years of independence, could have stopped Jinnah from breaking away by decentralising (perhaps more than any victorious party would have done). Instead, it took over the state apparatus of the Raj. These insufficiently accountable institutions are responsible for much of what is wrong with India and Pakistan today. 
That each country exists is a reproach to the other. Pakistan was founded on the ""two-nation theory"", which holds that Hindus and Muslims are defined most potently by their religion, making it impossible for them to live together. That idea justifies Pakistan's claim on Kashmir, India's only state with a Muslim majority, and suggests that India's i2om or so Muslims-almost as many as in Pakistan-are living in the wrong country. Indians on the right of the political spectrum cannot forgive Pakistan for rupturing their country; those on the left cannot accept the two-nation logic on which Pakistan was founded. In 1971 India helped Bangladesh break away from western Pakistan. To India, the secession by Bengali-speaking Muslims showed that language and culture are thicker than religion. To Pakistan, it was proof of India's malign intent. 
In Pakistan, the suspicion lingers that India will try again. The smaller country's internal divisions seem an invitation to mischief. Three of its provinces are restive about the dominance of the fourth, Punjab. Fanatics among the Sunni majority are killing members of the Shiite minority, who have their own murderous fanatics. Some people worry that fundamentalists returning from Pakistan-backed jihads in Afghanistan and Kashmir will try to purify Pakistan with their Kalashnikovs. 
India, meanwhile, sometimes wonders whether it really is one nation. Many of its 25 states are big enough and different enough from each other to be large countries in their own right. Bids by various regions for more autonomy were accommodated (most of the time), bought off or suppressed by the Indian government with varying degrees of finesse. Clashes of caste, class and creed periodically undermine order, if not India's territorial integrity. India is pocked with small wars, from the tribal insurgencies of the north-east to the caste wars of Bihar, where upper-caste private armies slaughter dalits (formerly known as untouchables), and Naxalite (Maoist) militias murder landlords in return. 
Only Kashmir, though, could drag India into a wider war. Disgruntled Kashmiris have a powerful patron in Pakistan; a so-year-old UN Security Council resolution accords them the right to choose between India and Pakistan by referendum. Given the chance, they would leave India, demolishing the one-nation theory on their way out. 
Mirror, mirror 
Secular, democratic India v sectarian, coup-prone Pakistan: no question, surely, which would win a political beauty contest? Set India's $30 billion of foreign-exchange reserves against Pakistan's nearbankruptcy, India's world-class software engineers against Pakistan's outdated cotton mills, and awarding the economic prize looks just as easy. Yet the comparison is not as lopsided as it seems at first. Travellers to Pakistan are often surprised to find its people looking more prosperous than Indians. Pakistan's income per head is indeed higher than India's, even leaving aside the giant black-market economy. Pakistan also appears to be a more equal society, even though most members of parliament still belong to the landed elite. India may boast that democracy has churned the social make-up of its political class, yet the caste system, despite half a century of deliberate erosion, still blights Indian society. In Pakistan, you would not see a scene witnessed by your correspondent on a railway platform in Mysore: a small, dark-skinned man being shooed off a bench by a corpulent, lighter-hued woman as though he were a stray dog. As for Pakistan's fabled lawlessness, Delhi's murder rate last year was roughly the same as Karachi's. 
Scholars such as Ayesha Jalal argue that Indian democracy is more formal than real, and there is not much to choose between India's and Pakistan's civil institutions. This is overstated: India has checks and balances and a democratic tradition the absence of which is leading Pakistan astray in increasingly sinister ways. Pakistan's bureaucracy, police and public services are so infested with corruption and political favouritism, and so starved of resources, that few Pakistanis expect anything from government except employment, made gainful by bribe-taking. India's courts are more independent and its press less subject to harassment, but corruption is equally pervasive. What Ronald Reagan, in his presidential days, was fond of calling ""waste, fraud and abuse"" hobbles the state at all levels in both India and Pakistan. Less of it would mean a healthier and better educated population, a more robust infrastructure, more competitive enterprises. 
There could be less of it if India and Pakistan make genuine peace. The sense of siege each instils in the other has the usual effect of threats on nations: making people think that citizens ought to serve the state, rather than the other way around. The governing classes have exploited this sentiment. Again, a qualification is in order. The two countries' mutual obsession with each other recedes in proportion to the distance from Delhi and Lahore. In Tamil Nadu it is not the contest between the Ramayana and the Koran that rankles, but the victory of the northern god Rama over the Dravidian antihero Ravana. Kashmir stings less in North West Frontier Province than it does in Punjab. 
If these two Asian laggards inspire both pity and fear, both also have reservoirs of resilience and sanity that make hope a third option. India has a few leaders who seem to understand that the state should serve its electors rather than its elect. In Pakistan, there are remarkable examples of the private sector taking over the duties of a corroded state and performing them well. Mr Vajpayee's visit in Lahore to the tower marking the spot where Jinnah called for the creation of a Muslim state was a hint that the old arguments over one nation or two nations may be coming to an end. But hope depends on whether Pakistan and India, perhaps without Mr Vajpayee at the helm, are prepared to let the logic of Lahore overrule a half-century of national instinct. 
The story so far 
August 1947: India and Pakistan are partitioned and gain independence from Britain. About a million people die in sectarian violence. 
October 1947: An invasion of Kashmir by Pakistani tribesmen triggers the first war between India and Pakistan. The Hindu maharaja of the Muslim-majority state agrees to accession to India. April 1948: A UN Security Council resolution calls for the withdrawal of Pakistani forces from Kashmir and the holding of a plebiscite, with a choice between 
accession to India or Pakistan. October t962: China invades India and defeats its army. 
October 1964: China conducts its first nuclear test. 
September t965: Pakistan's invasion of Kashmir provokes an Indian counterattack against Pakistani Punjab. December 1971: The third Indo-Pakistani war results in the secession of East from West Pakistan, creating the new state of Bangladesh. 
July 1972: In the Shimla agreement, In
dia and Pakistan promise to maintain the status quo until they settle their differences peacefully. 
May 1974: India tests its first nuclear bomb. 
July 1989: Insurgency against Indian rule breaks out in Kashmir. 
May 1998: India tests five nuclear devices; Pakistan answers by testing six. International sanctions are imposed on both nations. 
February 1999: In the Lahore declaration, India and Pakistan agree to discuss Kashmir and take steps to avoid the risk of nuclear war. ","IF YOU go to the main border crossing between eastern and western ( Indian and Pakistani ) Punjab at sundown any day of the week , you can watch a curious ritual . Wearing an expression of patriotic hauteur , a red - crowned border guard from each side marches towards the other with perfect synchrony , lowers his national flag and furls it , hoping to outdo the other in speed and precision . This prickly display , reminiscent of a stand - off between peacocks , is a symbol of kinship between the two countries that used to be one . But it is also a reminder that their bloody partition , their three wars and their continuing quarrel over Kashmir remain unforgotten . Their common border is meant to be contemplated rather than crossed . 
 Until recently , at least . On February 2oth Atal Bihari Vajpayee's , crossed the Punjabi customs post in a gold - coloured bus to meet Atal Bihari Vajpayee's Pakistani opposite number , Nawaz Sharif . That bus journey launched a regular service between Delhi , India 's capital , and Lahore , the capital of Pakistani Punjab , aimed at encouraging ordinary traffic in people , goods and ideas between estranged neighbours that now brandish nuclear weapons . Whatever their differences , Atal Bihari Vajpayee and Mr Sharif promised , they would be settled peacefully . 
 That promise seemed to pull India and Pakistan out of a subcontinental tail - spin . Their tit - for - tat nuclear tests in May 1998 had brought them opprobrium and economic sanctions , but they had also made the world sit up and notice them . Although South Asia 's seven countries have a population larger than China 's , and the biggest concentration of English - speakers outside the United States , their low levels of income and literacy had made them easy to ignore .

A STRETCH of the main road from Srinagar, Jammu & Kashmir's summer capital, to Anantnag is lined with workshops that fashion the local willow into cricket bats. There is something cheering about these little enterprises making a living from South Asia's favourite pastime in the region's most contested territory. 
The cheer quickly dissipates. Gulam Qadir (not his real name) says he shifted his stock from road level to the first floor of his shop because counter-- insurgents, former anti-Indian militants who have changed sides, have been harassing him. Sometimes they just demand free bats; when angry, they ""take up these sticks and beat us,"" Mr Qadir claims, gesturing towards the stacks of unfinished planks. He wants what almost everyone in the Kashmir Valley seems to want, azadi-independence. But like most businessmen, Mr Qadir has a pragmatic streak. ""Before azadi, we want a relaxed atmosphere,"" he says, ""which is not happening."" 
Mr Qadir and his fellow Kashmiris are caught up in one of the world's most intractable disputes. There is a legal side to it, there is a fiendishly complex issue of self-determination, there is a regional tussle that involves China as well as India and Pakistan, and then there are the realities on the ground, kept rigid by the power of the gun. These forces pull in different directions. But India is happier with the status quo than are the other main players, Pakistan and the Kashmiri people, and it is with India that a solution must start. 
The Kashmir problem is part of the aftermath of partition. The Hindu maharaja of Kashmir wanted independence, but hurriedly acceded to India in 1948 after Pakistani tribesmen invaded his realm. The principle that Kashmiris be allowed to determine their own future was established at the beginning. India's first prime minister, Jawaharlal Nehru, struck a deal with the maharaja, but thought that his (mostly Muslim) subjects should be the the true masters of Kashmir. A 1948 UN Security Council resolution, designed to end the first hostilities between India and Pakistan, calls for the withdrawal of Pakistani forces, followed by a plebiscite allowing Kashmiris to choose between joining India or Pakistan. It never happened. The state remains divided into zones of Indian, Pakistani and-because the Pakistanis let them have it and China occupied a chunk on its own-Chinese control. Pakistan regards union with the rest of Kashmir as ""the unfinished business of partition"". India, for its part, deems the state an integral part of its territory. China says it will talk about its slice once the other two have reached a deal. 
Missed opportunities 
India might have won a plebiscite had it not governed Kashmir so badly. Nehru had an ally in Kashmir's most popular leader, Sheikh Muhammad Abdullah, who thought of himself as a Kashmiri first and a Muslim second, and preferred Indian secularism to Pakistani sectarianism. It was a rocky relationship. Abdullah flirted with independence, and the central government never reconciled itself to the autonomy it had granted Kashmir. India's best friend in the state was imprisoned twice for a total of i8 years between 1953 and 1975. He won Kashmir's first genuinely free election in 1977. Yet in 1984 his son, Farooq, was dismissed as chief minister by Nehru's daughter, Indira Gandhi. There followed a period of obtuse and thuggish rule by the central government, a flawed election in 1987 that gave a more obedient Farooq another spell in power, and the outbreak of violence two years later. 
It has been an ugly war that does none of the parties involved much credit. The 400,000 or so troops that India keeps in Kashmir have often shown the same brutality as their foes. So far, about 24,000 people have died in the decade-long insurgency, say the police. The militants say 60,000. Either way, more have been killed than in all three Indo-Pakistani wars put together. 
Pakistan insists on sorting out the mess by holding the plebiscite as envisaged in the UN resolutions. That would bring more self-determination than at present, but not much. Jammu 8 Kashmir's population of 9m-10m is far from being all Muslim (see map). The Kashmir Valley has become almost all Muslim. Jammu has a Hindu majority and Ladakh a Buddhist one. It is a safe bet that in a plebiscite both would vote to remain with India but be dragged into union with Pakistan by the overall Muslim majority. In that event the Kashmir problem might well go on, with oppressor and oppressed swapping identities. 
More important, the uN-mandated plebiscite does not offer Kashmiris what most of them really want: azadi. A 1995 poll found that 72% of the Valley's inhabitants wanted independence. Being mostly Muslims does not make them Pakistanis. Their separate identity is based on place, kinship and culture as much as on religion. 
In India's view, Kashmiris would become loyal citizens again if only Pakistan would stop interfering. It sees the insurgency as a proxy war, which would end as soon as Pakistan stopped giving militants money and weapons and letting them infiltrate Kashmir across the line of control. Most militants, India claims, are foreign zealots imported from other holy wars, such as that in Afghanistan. It regards separatist political groups, two dozen of which are grouped under the All Parties Hurriyet Conference, as stooges of Pakistan. 
Pending a diplomatic solution, India thinks the war is going well. ""We are happy,"" says C.S Pokharia, deputy inspector-general of the Border Security Force, which keeps order in Kashmir. Fewer militants are infiltrating from Pakistan, and ""the killing of militants during encounters is quite favourable."" 
Mr Pokharia has some grounds for smugness. After a period when militants ruled the roost in big towns like Srinagar and even ran a parallel administration, the government now has the upper hand. Militants have been pushed out of the towns and the bazaars bustle again, though there are still sporadic shoot-outs even in the middle of Srinagar. The security forces are trying harder to target combatants and spare civilians. Elections in 1996, which were boycotted by the separatists, replaced direct rule from Delhi with a government headed by Farooq Abdullah. 
Normality is relative. Srinagar still looks like a city dumped inside a maximum-security prison, with guns poking through piles of sandbags on nearly every corner. Tourism, Kashmir's biggest industry, is still way below its pre-insurrection peak. Without the money spent by soldiers and their families, the economy would be flat on its back. And the war is far from over. The militants lie lower but strike harder, sometimes at the security forces, sometimes at innocents who happen to be Hindus. Casualties among security forces last year just fell short of the 1995 record. 
The security forces have become choosier, but no less brutal. Ravi Nair, head of the South Asian Human Rights Documentation Centre, says that captured foreign militants are summarily executed in faked ""encounters"". Detainees are routinely tortured. Kashmir is still subject to laws that permit security forces to shoot suspects and destroy property. And when they abuse their powers, there is no redress. Parveena Ahanger speaks for the parents of 300 missing children, including her son, who disappeared in 1991 after the National Security Guard arrested him: ""Not one person has been found, not one person has been punished."" 
Why peace is hard to do 
Competing claims of sovereignty and self-determination can never be resolved to everyone's satisfaction. Even modest ambitions, such as a lessening of violence, have been frustrated because every concession has been looked upon as a surrender of principle. It is unlikely that the Indian and Pakistani prime ministers bent their principles in Lahore. Compromises offered by either country always fall short of the other side's minimum demands. Thus India might accept the line of control as the permanent border, and Pakistan is willing to talk about holding a plebiscite in Kashmir by region rather than for the whole state, which would allow the parts populated by Hindus and Buddhists to vote to remain with India. But the crunch issue for both countries remains the disposition of the Muslim-- dominated Kashmir Valley. 
Mr Sharif is as close to being soft on Kashmir as any Pakistani leader is likely to get. Looking over his shoulder are Islamic fundamentalists, who have already branded his meeting with Mr Vajpayee a betrayal of Kashmir; the armed forces, whose budgets depend on continued tension with India; and InterServices Intelligence, the part of the armed forces thought to be arming and training fighters both in Afghanistan and Kashmir. 
In India, there are two distinct schools of thought on Kashmir. The weightier one, to which Mr Vajpayee and probably his electoral rival, Sonia Gandhi, belong, argues that there can be no compromise over the sovereignty of Indian-held Kashmir. But there are others who see merit in giving Pakistan some say in the affairs of the Valley-- though such creative solutions are unlikely to be tried for years to come. 
There need not be a grand settlement for things to improve in Kashmir, but two things will have to happen: Pakistan will have to squeeze the supply of violence and India will have to discourage the demand for it. If violence inside Kashmir goes down, India could reduce its security forces in the interior. 
Will Pakistan rein in the rebels? It denies giving them anything other than moral and diplomatic support, and claims to have limited power to curb them. It probably exaggerates its impotence. It has a large army along the line of control, which it uses selectively. The mujahideen of Lashkar-e-Taiba, one of the main guerrilla groups, mill about their office in Lahore impressively armed in full view of the police. Mr Sharif is under intense pressure from the United States-which controls the flow of money to Pakistan's bankrupt economy-to reduce tensions with India. But he is also on the hit-list of one of the extremist Islamic groups, and may be reluctant to provoke such groups further. India's behaviour towards its Kashmiri citizens should not depend on the number of terrorists infiltrating across the border. Farooq Abdullah's National Conference government in Kashmir, which had a flimsy mandate to begin with, has lost whatever popularity it had because of its clumsy administration and its failure to fulfill its promise to win back some of Kashmir's autonomy. Moreover, Kashmiris feel they are being ruled not by a popularly elected government but by policemen who behave more like an occupation force. Secessionist leaders, who represent an important slice of public opinion, play hardly any part in politics. The All Parties Hurriyet Conference is not an impressive body. Its two dozen members agree on little except opposition to Indian rule. Its leaders, fearing harassment by Indian forces, have little contact with the people they claim to represent. 
Mehbooba Mufti, a member of the state assembly from the Congress party, thinks the government should open an ""unconditional dialogue"" with militant groups and their political representatives. So far the separatists have held out for tripartite talks with India and Pakistan-""the only kind we will accept,"" says Yaseen Malik, leader of the pro-independence Jammu & Kashmir Liberation Front. But Ms Mufti reckons that even hardened separatists would agree to talk to the government on its own. ""Militant boys want a normal life-with honour, not with surrender,"" says Ms Mufti. She may be wrong. But if India is to prevail over the separatists, it will have to persuade rather than simply punish them. ","Why Kashmir remains at daggers drawn 
 A STRETCH of the main road from Srinagar , Jammu & Kashmir 's summer capital , to Anantnag is lined with workshops that fashion the local willow into cricket bats . There is something cheering about these little enterprises making a living from South Asia 's favourite pastime in the region 's most contested territory . 
 The cheer quickly dissipates . Gulam Qadir ( not his real name ) says he shifted his stock from road level to the first floor of his shop because counter-- insurgents , former anti - Indian militants who have changed sides , have been harassing him . Sometimes they just demand free bats ; when angry , they "" take up these sticks and beat us , "" Mr Qadir claims , gesturing towards the stacks of unfinished planks . He wants what almost everyone in the Kashmir Valley seems to want , azadi - independence . But like most businessmen , Mr Qadir has a pragmatic streak . "" Before azadi , we want a relaxed atmosphere , "" he says , "" which is not happening . "" 
 Mr Qadir and his fellow Kashmiris are caught up in one of the world 's most intractable disputes . There is a legal side to it , there is a fiendishly complex issue of self - determination , there is a regional tussle that involves China as well as India and Pakistan , and then there are the realities on the ground , kept rigid by the power of the gun . These forces pull in different directions . But India is happier with the status quo than are the other main players , Pakistan and the Kashmiri people , and it is with India that a solution must start . 
 The Kashmir problem is part of the aftermath of partition . The Hindu maharaja of Kashmir wanted independence , but hurriedly acceded to India in 1948 after Pakistani tribesmen invaded his realm . The principle that Kashmiris be allowed to determine their own future was established at the beginning . India 's first prime minister , Jawaharlal Nehru , struck a deal with the maharaja , but thought that his ( mostly Muslim ) subjects should be the the true masters of Kashmir . A 1948 UN Security Council resolution , designed to end the first hostilities between India and Pakistan , calls for the withdrawal of Pakistani forces , followed by a plebiscite allowing Kashmiris to choose between joining India or Pakistan . It never happened . The state remains divided into zones of Indian , Pakistani and - because the Pakistanis let them have it and China occupied a chunk on its own - Chinese control . Pakistan regards union with the rest of Kashmir as "" the unfinished business of partition "" . India , for its part , deems the state an integral part of its territory . China says it will talk about its slice once the other two have reached a deal . 
 Missed opportunities 
 India might have won a plebiscite had it not governed Kashmir so badly . Nehru had an ally in Kashmir 's most popular leader , Sheikh Muhammad Abdullah , who thought of himself as a Kashmiri first and a Muslim second , and preferred Indian secularism to Pakistani sectarianism . It was a rocky relationship . Abdullah flirted with independence , and the central government never reconciled itself to the autonomy it had granted Kashmir . India 's best friend in the state was imprisoned twice for a total of i8 years between 1953 and 1975 . He won Kashmir 's first genuinely free election in 1977 . Yet in 1984 his son , Farooq , was dismissed as chief minister by Nehru 's daughter , Indira Gandhi . There followed a period of obtuse and thuggish rule by the central government , a flawed election in 1987 that gave a more obedient Farooq another spell in power , and the outbreak of violence two years later . 
 It has been an ugly war that does none of the parties involved much credit . The 400,000 or so troops that India keeps in Kashmir have often shown the same brutality as their foes . So far , about 24,000 people have died in the decade - long insurgency , say the police . The militants say 60,000 . Either way , more have been killed than in all three Indo - Pakistani wars put together . 
 Pakistan insists on sorting out the mess by holding the plebiscite as envisaged in the UN resolutions . That would bring more self - determination than at present , but not much . Jammu 8 Kashmir 's population of 9m-10 m is far from being all Muslim ( see map ) . The Kashmir Valley has become almost all Muslim . Jammu has a Hindu majority and Ladakh a Buddhist one . It is a safe bet that in a plebiscite both would vote to remain with India but be dragged into union with Pakistan by the overall Muslim majority . In that event the Kashmir problem might well go on , with oppressor and oppressed swapping identities . 
 More important , the uN - mandated plebiscite does not offer Kashmiris what most of them really want : azadi . A 1995 poll found that 72 % of the Valley 's inhabitants wanted independence . Being mostly Muslims does not make them Pakistanis . Their separate identity is based on place , kinship and culture as much as on religion . 
 In India 's view , Kashmiris would become loyal citizens again if only Pakistan would stop interfering . It sees the insurgency as a proxy war , which would end as soon as Pakistan stopped giving militants money and weapons and letting them infiltrate Kashmir across the line of control . Most militants , India claims , are foreign zealots imported from other holy wars , such as that in Afghanistan . It regards separatist political groups , two dozen of which are grouped under the All Parties Hurriyet Conference , as stooges of Pakistan . 
 Pending a diplomatic solution , India thinks the war is going well . "" We are happy , "" says C.S Pokharia , deputy inspector - general of the Border Security Force , which keeps order in Kashmir . Fewer militants are infiltrating from Pakistan , and "" the killing of militants during encounters is quite favourable . "" 
 Mr Pokharia has some grounds for smugness . After a period when militants ruled the roost in big towns like Srinagar and even ran a parallel administration , the government now has the upper hand . Militants have been pushed out of the towns and the bazaars bustle again , though there are still sporadic shoot - outs even in the middle of Srinagar . The security forces are trying harder to target combatants and spare civilians . Elections in 1996 , which were boycotted by the separatists , replaced direct rule from Delhi with a government headed by Farooq Abdullah . 
 Normality is relative . Srinagar still looks like a city dumped inside a maximum - security prison , with guns poking through piles of sandbags on nearly every corner . Tourism , Kashmir 's biggest industry , is still way below its pre - insurrection peak . Without the money spent by soldiers and their families , the economy would be flat on its back . And the war is far from over . The militants lie lower but strike harder , sometimes at the security forces , sometimes at innocents who happen to be Hindus . Casualties among security forces last year just fell short of the 1995 record . 
 The security forces have become choosier , but no less brutal . Ravi Nair , head of the South Asian Human Rights Documentation Centre , says that captured foreign militants are summarily executed in faked "" encounters "" . Detainees are routinely tortured . Kashmir is still subject to laws that permit security forces to shoot suspects and destroy property . And when they abuse their powers , there is no redress . Parveena Ahanger speaks for the parents of 300 missing children , including her son , who disappeared in 1991 after the National Security Guard arrested him : "" Not one person has been found , not one person has been punished . "" 
 Why peace is hard to do 
 Competing claims of sovereignty and self - determination can never be resolved to everyone 's satisfaction . Even modest ambitions , such as a lessening of violence , have been frustrated because every concession has been looked upon as a surrender of principle . It is unlikely that the Indian and Pakistani prime ministers bent their principles in Lahore . Compromises offered by either country always fall short of the other side 's minimum demands . Thus India might accept the line of control as the permanent border , and Pakistan is willing to talk about holding a plebiscite in Kashmir by region rather than for the whole state , which would allow the parts populated by Hindus and Buddhists to vote to remain with India . But the crunch issue for both countries remains the disposition of the Muslim-- dominated Kashmir Valley . 
 Mr Sharif is as close to being soft on Kashmir as any Pakistani leader is likely to get . Looking over his shoulder are Islamic fundamentalists , who have already branded his meeting with Atal Bihari Vajpayee a betrayal of Kashmir ; the armed forces , whose budgets depend on continued tension with India ; and InterServices Intelligence , the part of the armed forces thought to be arming and training fighters both in Afghanistan and Kashmir . 
 In India , there are two distinct schools of thought on Kashmir . The weightier one , to which Atal Bihari Vajpayee and probably Atal Bihari Vajpayee's electoral rival , Sonia Gandhi , belong , argues that there can be no compromise over the sovereignty of Indian - held Kashmir . But there are others who see merit in giving Pakistan some say in the affairs of the Valley-- though such creative solutions are unlikely to be tried for years to come . 
 There need not be a grand settlement for things to improve in Kashmir , but two things will have to happen : Pakistan will have to squeeze the supply of violence and India will have to discourage the demand for it . If violence inside Kashmir goes down , India could reduce its security forces in the interior . 
 Will Pakistan rein in the rebels ? It denies giving them anything other than moral and diplomatic support , and claims to have limited power to curb them . It probably exaggerates its impotence . It has a large army along the line of control , which it uses selectively . The mujahideen of Lashkar - e - Taiba , one of the main guerrilla groups , mill about their office in Lahore impressively armed in full view of the police . Mr Sharif is under intense pressure from the United States - which controls the flow of money to Pakistan 's bankrupt economy - to reduce tensions with India . But he is also on the hit - list of one of the extremist Islamic groups , and may be reluctant to provoke such groups further . India 's behaviour towards its Kashmiri citizens should not depend on the number of terrorists infiltrating across the border . Farooq Abdullah 's National Conference government in Kashmir , which had a flimsy mandate to begin with , has lost whatever popularity it had because of its clumsy administration and its failure to fulfill its promise to win back some of Kashmir 's autonomy . Moreover , Kashmiris feel they are being ruled not by a popularly elected government but by policemen who behave more like an occupation force .

PEACE between South Asia's two nuclear powers is based on the premise that their dispute over Kashmir isjust a little local difficulty. However fierce the fight between India and Pakistan over the Himalayan state becomes, it is never again to escalate into a wider war, as it has done twice in the past. Yet, just a year after the two countries made war more dangerous by testing nuclear weapons, that premise is looking shaky. 
On May 26th, India resorted to air strikes to drive out some 600 fighters who had taken up positions well within India's side of the border in Kashmir-the ""line of control"" normally respected by both countries. India attacked again the next day and lost two aircraft. One was hit by a missile fired from the ground, India said; the other had a mechanical failure. Both aircraft crashed on the Pakistani side of the line of control. Pakistan claimed that the aircraft had been flying over Pakistani Kashmir, but this was denied by India. 
Whatever actually happened, the use by India of air power so close to Pakistan's side may be viewed as a threat, if not an act of outright aggression. When scenario-spinners envisage how a nuclear war might start, the opening sequence generally involves some such action. 
Pakistan's foreign ministry says Pakistan does not want the situation to escalate. But the risks of accidents and misunderstanding, and even a new war, are high. 
The shooting season in Kashmir normally begins in the early months of the year, when the snow melts and militants cross the mountain passes to renew their campaign to wrest India's Muslim-majority state from Delhi's control. This spring's violence is unusual for two reasons. It follows a dramatic peace-seeking bus trip to Pakistan that the Indian prime minister, Atal Behari Vajpayee, made in February. That seemed to have put the two countries' relations on a friendlier footing, and Indian officials certainly hoped that a quieter border would be one consequence. Instead, the incursion is more menacing than usual. 
According to India's version of events, 54o-68o militants, most of them under-employed Taliban fighters from Afghanistan, crossed the line of control after an early thaw and took up positions near the towns of Kargil and Drass. In some places, their positions overlook the road that links Srinagar, the capital of Jammu & Kashmir (the formal name for the Indian state), to Leh, the main town of its Ladakh region. The infiltrators have dug into positions up to six kilometres (four miles) inside Indian territory. That looks to India like a Pakistani attempt to redraw the de facto border, in contravention of a 1972 agreement. 
Such high-altitude conquest, India thinks, required help from the Pakistan army, in the form of radar, mortars and snowmobiles, among other things. It also took advance planning, which must have been going on while the two prime ministers were embracing each other in Lahore. India claims that some regular Pakistani army troops are among the invaders. 
Why is war breaking out just three months after Mr Vajpayee and Nawaz Sharif, his Pakistani counterpart, promised peace? Pakistan's official line is that it is not involved. The heights near Kargil are occupied not by imported mujahideen, still less by Pakistani troops, but by indigenous freedom fighters. 
Pakistan accuses India of unprovoked shelling that is killing civilians across the line of control. But Pakistani officials hardly seem to expect their denial to be fully believed. A little-known Pakistan-based militant group has reportedly claimed credit for the infiltration. In the absence of fact, speculation has flourished. India's national-security adviser, Brajesh Mishra, wonders aloud whether Mr Sharif knew what the army was planning. Others think he has embarked on a Kashmiri adventure to distract attention from his crackdown against the press, which has provoked foreign and domestic clamour. 
Another theory is that Pakistan is trying to provoke international intervention in a conflict that India wants to keep strictly bilateral. Then there is guessing that Pakistan might pull back in exchange for an Indian retreat in Siachen, a glacier over which the two countries have been fighting. Whatever the truth, the clash suggests that the talks in Lahore did not resolve the dangerous mismatch between Indian and Pakistani approaches to talking about Kashmir. 
To Pakistan, the Kashmiris' right to ""selfdetermination"" remains the core issue between the two countries. Pakistan accuses India of talking about almost anything but that, which is why it must keep applying the pressure. ""If there is a decline in the level of militancy in Kashmir,"" says Khalid Mahmud, an analyst at the Institute of Regional Studies in Islamabad, ""India will back out of the dialogue."" 
The Indian view is exactly the reverse: progress on Kashmir will start not with dialogue but with a reduction in Pakistan-exported violence. Failing that, India must show that its self-defence can be both ruthless and restricted. That is the point of the air operation. Evicting the intruders from their mountain redoubts with ground forces alone was beginning to look like a protracted and expensive task. 
By May z5th, said officials, 17 Indian soldiers had died and 90 had been injured. Surgical air strikes may have seemed a quicker and safer way to accomplish the job. (They may also be a way of shielding India's Mr Vajpayee, who faces an election this year, from charges by the opposition that military neglect encouraged the incursion in the first place.) Success would allow India to claim that it can be as tough as it needs to be on Kashmir without provoking a wider war. But that is not the same as making peace. 
The incident is likely to harden both countries' positions on Kashmir. Pakistan will continue trying to prove that Kashmir is a big deal while India strives to show that it is a manageable problem. The cycle is likely to go on because the costs have so far been tolerable: about zoo Indian soldiers die every year and the invaders revel in martyrdom. The danger is that each time they clash, even by proxy, they risk turning strategy into war. ","India and Pakistan clash over a territory that has caused two wars

WAR between us is now unthinkable, claimed the two newest nuclear powers last year, as both sought to reassure an anxious world that their newly-tested weapons were in responsible hands. Yet India and Pakistan are now at war, or something close to it, over Kashmir, a disputed state that has been the cause of two full-scale wars in the past halfcentury. India's air force is in action for the first time since 1971, in an attempt to dislodge Pakistani-backed militants from the snowy peaks near Kargil, on India's side of what has become, in effect, the border-the ""line of control"". Both countries say they want peace. Yet neither seems willing to bend for it. Pakistan's foreign minister is due in Delhi on June 12th. He should use the occasion to negotiate a face-saving retreat. Then it will be India's turn to compromise. 
The latest crisis is Pakistan's doing. Springtime always brings violence across this provisional border, which separates Pakistani-administered Kashmir from India's side of the Muslim-majority state. Militants sponsored by Pakistan often cross the line to murder officials and civilians as part of a campaign to wrest control of the territory from India. Routine shelling claims casualties on both sides. This year Pakistan sent well-armed fighters (most of them its own soldiers, India claims) to try to alter the de facto border by force. Pakistan insists that the intruders are ""freedom fighters"" acting on their own, but few believe that. Rather Pakistan seems to be hoping that worries about escalating violence in these potentially fissile times will encourage outsiders to intervene in a dispute that India insists is no one else's business. 
So far the targets of Pakistan's nuclear-backed dare have kept their cool. Foreign powers have wisely avoided interfering. India is trying to confine its counter-offensive to its side of the line of control, hoping to deny Pakistan any pretext for escalation (see page 36). Nuclear weapons have helped to encourage the crisis but are also, for the moment, helping to contain it. In 1965 a similar, albeit bigger, provocation drove India to attack Pakistan's heartland. 
Yet whether the intruders are pulled out by Pakistan or thrown out by India, it will then be India's turn to show flexibility. The prime minister, Atal Behari Vajpayee, promised to turn his attention to the Kashmiri dispute during his peace mission to Pakistan in February. Pakistan's support for the militants does not release India from that promise. 
India has long contended that peace would return to Kashmir if only Pakistan would stop interfering. That is, at best, a half-truth. India has tamed a decade-long insurgency against its rule. There seem to be fewer home-grown insurgents and more foreign infiltrators. But that does not mean Kashmir has returned to normal, or that its people are content to remain under Indian rule. Most Muslims there seem to want independence, rather than rule by India or Pakistan. India adamantly refuses to offer them the choice. But if it is to govern Kashmir peaceably, it needs to rebuild its own legitimacy in the eyes of Kashmiri Muslims, and to talk to Pakistan about Kashmir, even if sovereignty is not on the table. 
Time to talk 
There was a time when even Kashmiri Muslims thought secular India would protect their distinct identity better than avowedly Islamic Pakistan. That trust could be revived. India values Kashmir in part because its Muslim majority bolsters the country's official ideology of ""unity in diversity"". Kashmir is not Kosovo; ethnic cleansing is the last thing on most Indian minds. It is the years of misrule by Delhi that have stoked demands for self-determination. 
Kashmir remains a bullied state. It has lost the autonomy it once enjoyed. Indian policing is venal, oppressive and sometimes brutal. Kashmir's literacy rate is below India's low average. Local elections set for May and June, which officials promised would demonstrate Kashmir's capacity for normal political life, were postponed. India could start to put matters right by opening an unconditional dialogue with the separatists in its part of Kashmir, as some local politicians have suggested. 
That would not automatically reduce tensions with Pakistan, but it might help. Hardliners will not be content until Kashmir is wrested from Indian control. But there are moderates-the prime minister, Nawaz Sharif, may be one-who might settle for something less, or at least later, if India would talk seriously about Kashmir. The problem may not be soluble. But it will not even be manageable unless Pakistan ends its brinkmanship and India responds with statesmanship.

AN AMERICAN general shuttled to Islamabad. A top American diplomat appeared in Delhi. Indian and Pakistani envoys made secret visits to each other's capitals. Pakistan's prime minister was in Beijing. Will this diplomatic flurry end the mini-war between India and Pakistan over Kashmir before it erupts into a wider conflict between the two nuclear powers? 
It offers some hope. India and the major powers are delivering a single message to Pakistan, and some powerful Pakistanis may be listening. Whether they act on what they hear depends largely on Pakistan's murky and unpredictable politics. 
The message is that Pakistan must withdraw its infiltrators, many of them thought to be regular Pakistani troops, from India's side of the line of control, the line that divides Kashmir into Indian and Pakistani zones. Only then can the two countries resume talks over other issues concerning the Muslim-majority state. This is what Anthony Zinni, an American general, told Pakistan's prime minister, Nawaz Sharif, last week. There has also been speculation that America will press Pakistan by asking the IMF to withhold the next $100m instalment of a loan it desperately needs. 
Mr Sharif had hoped to hear a friendlier message from Pakistan's long-standing ally, China. Apparently not. China's statements were studiously neutral; they said nothing about an immediate ceasefire, which would leave Pakistani forces on Indian territory, nor did they link withdrawal to a solution of the wider Kashmir issue. For reasons that were unclear, Mr Sharif cut short his visit and hurried back to Pakistan. 
Isolated diplomatically, Pakistan now faces a choice between continuing its offensive in Kashmir at the risk of provoking a catastrophic war or finding a face-saving way out. The first hint that it is looking for an escape came with a ""secret"" mission to Delhi by a former Pakistani foreign secretary, Niaz Naik. Pakistan at first denied that Mr Naik was its emissary and then admitted that he had carried a message to India's prime minister, Atal Behari Vajpayee. Mr Naik hinted at the message on June z9th when he said that Mr Vajpayee had discussed letting the two countries' directors of military operations prepare a ""schedule of so-called withdrawal""-so-called, presumably, because Pakistan does not admit to having any control over the fighters in Indian Kashmir. The meetings could start within the ""next two or three days"". Mr Vajpayee's response, said Mr Naik, was that negotiations on Kashmir and other issues could be resumed and ""accelerated"" after the Pakistani pull-out. 
These are the outlines of the only deal that makes sense. It is the commitment to resume talks on Kashmir that would offer Pakistan hope of avoiding complete humiliation. India will not negotiate about Kashmir while intruders are on its soil, nor will it accept deadlines for resolving the issue even after they pull out, as Pakistan has also suggested. But there might be a way to organise the talks, which Pakistan could dress up as an Indian concession. 
Both countries are downplaying Mr Naik's visit. Yet India seems willing to give peace a chance. With its army gaining ground against the intruders and foreign powers backing its demand that they must withdraw, India is ""willing to try a course of discussion and dialogue,"" says a western diplomat. India has apparently decided for the time being not to take its counter-offensive to Pakistan's side of Kashmir. 
But will Pakistan go along? Confusion persists over who is in command of a country where the armed forces are used to wielding power, where Islamist fundamentalists pounce on any sign of weakness towards India over Kashmir and where the two groups sometimes overlap. News of Mr Naik's visit to Delhi was leaked, reportedly by people who wanted to scuttle the mission. The chief of Pakistan's army, Pervez Musharraf, has said that there would be ""no unilateral withdrawal"" (a spokesman adding swiftly that this was not an admission of responsibility for the incursion). One theory about why the prime minister cut short his visit to China is that he rushed home to forestall a military coup. Some worry that, even if Mr Sharif wants a way out, the army may block it. 
Talk of peace has not reduced the mayhem in Kashmir. The war over the frigid crags of Ladakh saw its bloodiest day yet on June 29th, when, said the Indian army, zl of its soldiers and 4o of Pakistan's died in the reconquest of two peaks. India has now eliminated most of the threat to a crucial road that links Srinagar, Kashmir's capital, to the main city in Ladakh. Faced with setbacks, Pakistani-backed forces have tried to open new fronts. And terrorism is on the rise. On June 29th, 15 Muslims were killed in the Jammu region. India blames fighting among factions of anti-Indian militants; the militants blame India's security forces. The next day12people,mostly Hindus, were murdered. 
The hoped-for pullout will not end the mistrust between India and Pakistan. Nor will it swiftly resolve their so-year quarrel over Kashmir. India regards the invasion of its territory soon after the two countries' prime ministers had promised peace in their Lahore meeting as a betrayal. India's approach to the next round of negotiations is bound to depend on who emerges on top in Pakistan. If the army is humiliated, Mr Sharif may become a credible negotiating partner; if he is seen as having betrayed Kashmir, zealots may call the shots. For its part, Pakistan is unlikely to trust India to negotiate seriously about Kashmir, especially with an election due in India. 
Indian analysts talk of converting India's military and diplomatic momentum into backing for its favoured resolution to the Kashmir issue: permanent division of the state between India and Pakistan along the line of control. Even a humbled Pakistan is unlikely to accept that, and outsiders are unlikely to push for it. India should not confuse a triumph in Ladakh-if it happens-with victory in Kashmir.

JUST hours after his regular weekend cricket match in Lahore, Nawaz Sharif suddenly dashed off to Washington where, despite the Independence Day holiday, he had a long meeting with Bill Clinton. The result, say Mr Sharif's friends, is that the Pakistani prime minister has averted a fourth war with India, its third over the disputed region of Kashmir. Mr Sharif's critics call it a national sell-out. Even though reality may lie somewhere in the middle, Mr Sharif still has a fight on his hands back home. 
American officials said Mr Sharif essentially agreed to withdraw Pakistan's support for the infiltrators, many of whom are thought to be regular Pakistani troops, who have crossed into India's side of the ""line of control"", which divides Kashmir. Pakistani officials say that Mr Sharif can only appeal to the rebels to withdraw. Pakistan still insists it is not responsible for the incursion. 
Mr Sharif may also have received assurances that, should the withdrawal of the ""freedom fighters"" take place, other benefits would flow. Despite denials from American and Pakistani officials, western diplomats say that, if Pakistan had remained inflexible, America would have considered blocking the next instalment of a $100m loan that has been agreed to by the IMF. But none of that impresses Pakistan's Islamic militants. 
In recent weeks, they have been warning Mr Sharif that any deal he might make over Kashmir they would oppose, even with force. On July 7th, Sayed Salahuddin, the head of the United Jihad Council, an alliance of guerrilla groups, threatened to keep on fighting in Kashmir ""until the last drop of our blood"". Nevertheless, he did indicate that the fighters might leave their positions once the snow begins to fall heavily in October. It might even be earlier. Sartaj Aziz, Pakistan's foreign minister, says that if the guerrillas discerned progress in the dispute they would leave. ""Otherwise they are entitled to do what they wish to do.. until the Kashmir issue is resolved."" 
Despite the militants' fiery words, they have not yet put up much of a show of defiance. A protest called this week by several Islamist parties attracted only a few hundred people rather than the thousands that the organisers had hoped for. But this does not mean Mr Sharif can relax. Although no reliable estimates are available, some Islamic activists claim that they have more than 150,000 students at religious institutions in Pakistan (which are often used as training schools for fighters). In addition, there are the jihad (holy war) volunteers, many of whom are battle-hardened from fighting in Afghanistan, and who might easily mount a war within Pakistan if asked to do so. 
On top of that, Mr Sharif has to worry about other nationalists, including some of his own armed forces. Nevertheless, his commanders have to consider the diplomatic isolation that the incursion has brought Pakistan. Reluctantly, some may be persuaded to take a less hawkish line. The army's chief of staff, General Pervez Musharraf, is reported to have said the guerrillas would be asked to ""change their position"", although he would not guess what their reply might be. 
Clinton's personal interest 
Much will depend on how both Pakistan and India deal with one of the most sensitive issues to emerge after the Washington meeting. That was a statement of Mr Clinton's intention to ""take a personal interest"" in a resumption of bilateral talks between the two countries once the line of control had been fully restored. Those talks, said the Americans, would best take place as part of the dialogue that began in Lahore in February when Mr Sharif met the Indian prime minister, Atal Behari Vajpayee. 
Although Pakistan's Mr Aziz linked a pullout of the militants to progress in resolving the dispute, India's foreign ministry said: ""We reject this linkage completely."" India has always been careful to silence any hint that it would accept outside mediation. It is wary of Pakistan's attempt to internationalise the Kashmir issue. That Pakistan can perhaps claim to have done so may in the end be the only victory it can claim. At any rate, Mr Sharif must hope it will be enough for the militants-at least for now. 
Critics of the Indian government already say that American involvement is implicit from the Washington statement. The opposition Congress party has warned the govemment against any American intervention and demanded to know the contents of a telephone call Mr Clinton made to Mr Vajpayee during the meeting with Mr Sharif. 
So far, say Indian officials, there is no evidence of a withdrawal. An Indian military spokesman said a counter-attack by Pakistani forces had to be repelled this week. Although Indian troops are still buoyed by recapturing some of the craggy heights, casualties are mounting. According to official figures, 217 Indian soldiers have died and over 450 have been wounded. To clear out all the guerrillas would be even more costly in human lives-and probably not possible without crossing the line of control to cut off their supplies. The Washington meeting may well have taken some pressure off India to make that fateful decision. 
Indian analysts are deeply sceptical of Mr Sharif's ability to achieve a Pakistani withdrawal. Even if Pakistan's prime minister can overcome his hardliners and restore some kind of peace to Kashmir, it would still be a long way from settling the 52-year-old dispute. But it just might strengthen Mr Sharif at home. It would also enable India to continue to bask in the glow of international approval for showing restraint in the face of aggression. And it would let Mr Vajpayee get on with fighting an autumn election. ","Can Pakistan 's prime minister get the militants on his side for an American - backed withdrawal from Kashmir ? 
 JUST hours after his regular weekend cricket match in Lahore , Nawaz Sharif suddenly dashed off to Washington where , despite the Independence Day holiday , he had a long meeting with Bill Clinton . The result , say Mr Sharif 's friends , is that the Pakistani prime minister has averted a fourth war with India , its third over the disputed region of Kashmir . Mr Sharif 's critics call it a national sell - out . Even though reality may lie somewhere in the middle , Mr Sharif still has a fight on his hands back home . 
 American officials said Mr Sharif essentially agreed to withdraw Pakistan 's support for the infiltrators , many of whom are thought to be regular Pakistani troops , who have crossed into India 's side of the "" line of control "" , which divides Kashmir . Pakistani officials say that Mr Sharif can only appeal to the rebels to withdraw . Pakistan still insists it is not responsible for the incursion . 
 Mr Sharif may also have received assurances that , should the withdrawal of the "" freedom fighters "" take place , other benefits would flow . Despite denials from American and Pakistani officials , western diplomats say that , if Pakistan had remained inflexible , America would have considered blocking the next instalment of a $ 100 m loan that has been agreed to by the IMF . But none of that impresses Pakistan 's Islamic militants . 
 In recent weeks , they have been warning Mr Sharif that any deal he might make over Kashmir they would oppose , even with force . On July 7th , Sayed Salahuddin , the head of the United Jihad Council , an alliance of guerrilla groups , threatened to keep on fighting in Kashmir "" until the last drop of our blood "" . Nevertheless , he did indicate that the fighters might leave their positions once the snow begins to fall heavily in October . It might even be earlier . Sartaj Aziz , Pakistan 's foreign minister , says that if the guerrillas discerned progress in the dispute they would leave . "" Otherwise they are entitled to do what they wish to do .. until the Kashmir issue is resolved . "" 
 Despite the militants ' fiery words , they have not yet put up much of a show of defiance . A protest called this week by several Islamist parties attracted only a few hundred people rather than the thousands that the organisers had hoped for . But this does not mean Mr Sharif can relax . Although no reliable estimates are available , some Islamic activists claim that they have more than 150,000 students at religious institutions in Pakistan ( which are often used as training schools for fighters ) . In addition , there are the jihad ( holy war ) volunteers , many of whom are battle - hardened from fighting in Afghanistan , and who might easily mount a war within Pakistan if asked to do so . 
 On top of that , Mr Sharif has to worry about other nationalists , including some of his own armed forces . Nevertheless , his commanders have to consider the diplomatic isolation that the incursion has brought Pakistan . Reluctantly , some may be persuaded to take a less hawkish line . The army 's chief of staff , General Pervez Musharraf , is reported to have said the guerrillas would be asked to "" change their position "" , although he would not guess what their reply might be .

The decision by one of the world's poorest countries to spend over $120m to buy the aircraft from Russia has strained relations with the United States, which has publicly questioned the need for the jets. Other foreign donors are equally sceptical. So are critics at home. 
Even before the deal was concluded earlier this month, the opposition parties alleged corruption. They say that, because the Bangladeshi air force lacks the necessary spares and expertise, it will have to rely on India to keep the jets in the air. India is often viewed with suspicion and resentment, fuelled in part by Bangladesh's huge trade deficit with its giant neighbour. 
The two countries are, however, trying to get along better. During a visit last month by the Indian prime minister, Atal Behari Vajpayee, to inaugurate a direct bus service between the Indian city of Calcutta and Bangladesh's capital Dhaka, the prime minister, Sheikh Hasina, reminded people of the decisive role played by India's forces in helping Bangladesh to secede from Pakistan in 1971. Her reference to India's part in what Bangladeshis call the ""liberation war"" was unusual, as the role of the Indian soldiers who fought alongside Bangladeshi independence fighters is seldom mentioned by officials. 
As for the trade deficit, Bangladesh is thought to have large reserves of natural gas that it could use to help narrow the gap. Shell, which operates an offshore field in the Bay of Bengal, reckons Bangladesh's gas reserves could be as big as Indonesia's, which are among the largest in Asia. Multinationals, America and the World Bank all want Bangladesh to export some of its gas to energy-hungry India. A single pipeline taking gas to India could bring in hundreds of thousands of dollars a year. 
So far the government has resisted. Bangladesh's energy reserves may be large, but its gas and power networks are old and decrepit, and the lights regularly go out in Dhaka. The government fears that, if it allows the export of natural gas, the opposition will accuse it of selling out to India, though the leader of the opposition, Begum Khaleda Zia, has actually softened her line on gas exports recently. With business in favour, there is speculation that the government may try to negotiate a deal with India before the Bangladeshi general election in 2001. 
An agreement in 1996 to share water from the Ganges river during the dry season has helped to improve relations with India, although Mr Vajpayee and Sheikh Hasina have so far been unable to agree to share water from another 5o rivers. But after the dry season comes the floods. With torrential rain in Bangladesh and in the rivers' catchment areas in India, the annual deluge has begun. A third of the country normally goes under water each year, but last year Bangladesh suffered its worst flood in a century. Sheikh Hasina won praise for her handling of the emergency, but there are fears that even a small flood this year could create havoc because much of the damage to flood defences from last year has yet to be repaired. 
Another of Bangladesh's perennial problems is political violence, particularly the violence perpetrated by Marxist and Maoist groups. Most abandoned their ideology years ago, and have turned to racketeering and extortion. Last year several thousand people died in attacks and bombings. The government, which was elected after promising to improve law and order, has had more than so,ooo people arrested in the past three months. This has helped to improve security and allay public anger, though many Bangladeshis believe that a series of highly publicised mass surrenders of suspects were more political theatre than a genuine end to a reign of terror. The ringleaders are said to be hiding in India. Not even a squadron of new MiGs is likely to bring them to book.

HE THREW Pakistan out of Indian territory. He revived the economy. Inflation, which turned voters against his Bharatiya Janata Party in state elections last year, has dropped to a record low. The prime minister, Atal Behari Vajpayee, is ""tried, tested, triumphant"", boasts the BJP, which kicked off its campaign for re-election at the centre this week. The opposition Congress party, which helped topple Mr Vajpayee's government last spring, bringing about India's third general election in little more than three years, is on the defensive. 
Early polling and punditry suggest that the election, which takes place in stages from September 5th to October 3rd, will produce a coalition government similar to the last, perhaps with a bit more discipline and cohesion than its unruly predecessor. An opinion poll published in Outlook, a weekly magazine, predicts that the BJP will add modestly to the third of the seats it won in the 1998 election. Together with the 15 other parties in the National Democratic Alliance, it should command a slim parliamentary majority without depending, as in the last parliament, on outside support. For the first time, the poll predicts, the BJP'S share of the popular vote will exceed Congress's. Various non-aligned parties, whose clout depends on a hung parliament, would be disappointed. 
If that happens, not much will change. Stop-go economic reform will probably continue, even though some of the BJP's partners call themselves socialists. The secularism of these allies will continue to temper the party's Hindu-nationalist ideology. India's newly deft foreign policy would also carry on. The biggest changes could come in some of the five states that are holding their own elections at the same time. Three of these states, Karnataka, Maharashtra and Andhra Pradesh, ranked among the top destinations for foreign investment in India last year. 
The BJP has had good luck and, helped by a media operation that one newspaper says ""border[sl on the manipulative"", is exploiting it shrewdly. The victory over the Pakistani-backed guerrillas who infiltrated into Indian territory near Kargil in Kashmir six weeks ago was a political windfall. The Be had anyway planned to build its campaign around the prime minister, who is more popular than his party. Kargil made him a war hero and master diplomat. 
Kargil also allows the BJP to portray itself, for the first time credibly, not as champion merely of India's Hindus but of India itself. Until now the nationalist aura has belonged to Congress, which gave India Mahatma Gandhi, its greatest martyr, and Jawaharlal Nehru, its first prime minister. Now, hints BJP propaganda, Mr Vajpayee is more truly their heir than Sonia Gandhi, Congress's Italian-born leader. ""The history of India is Atal,"" gushed a poem handed to a journalist at the BJP'S rally in Delhi on August 8th. 
Congress's ripostes have so far been weak. Voters do not, yet, buy its claim that India's soldiers deserve all the credit for driving the infiltrators out of Kashmir, and the government all the blame for letting them in to begin with. Though communal violence recently erupted in the capital of Gujarat, a BJPrun state, charges that the BJP is fomenting religious intolerance are not sticking. The BJP is expected to shelve its own Hindu-nationalist manifesto in favour of a common programme for the National Democratic Alliance; Mr Vajpayee's seeming moderation makes Congress's appeals to secularism seem even less compelling. 
Congress's claim to offer a better prospect of stable government than the multiheaded alliance has been dented in two ways: Congress needs allies of its own, among them Jayalalitha Jayaram, the erratic Tamil Nadu politician who triggered the downfall of Mr Vajpayee's last government. And the party itself looked less than stable after Sharad Pawar, the party boss in Maharashtra, which sent more Congress Mps to Parliament than any other state, suggested in May that Indians bom abroad should not hold high office. He then formed his own party, which will drain votes from Congress. 
Fortunes could easily shift in the seven weeks before voting ends. Pakistan-backed militants have stepped up attacks on Indian security forces in Kashmir since withdrawing from the heights above Kargil. And on August loth India shot down a Pakistani reconnaissance aircraft, killing all 16 people aboard. India claimed it had strayed into its airspace. The wrong sort of clash with Pakistan could deflate the air of triumph around Mr Vajpayee. More communal violence, especially in sJP-govemed states, would injure his air of innocence. Considering the euphoria over Kargil, the margin of victory suggested by the Outlook poll was narrow. 
""In the 1970s or 1980s, an issue like Kargil would have won an election,"" says Yogendra Yadav, a political scientist. These days, national polls are the aggregates of 32 largely independent state and regional elections, in which local issues and caste loyalties can trump matters of war and peace. That could hurt the BJP in India's biggest state, Uttar Pradesh, where an unpopular government led by the BJP has been weakened by persistent in-fighting. Gujarat and Punjab are other states where the BJP could be hurt by association with incumbents. 
Just how much Congress will benefit from these various BJP weaknesses is uncertain. Mrs Gandhi wants to rebuild support among Muslims and lower castes in Uttar Pradesh, which sent no Congress Mps to the last Parliament. Her hopes of doing so were bruised this week when a potential ally, a party representing mainly dalits (formerly known as untouchables), said that it would run a candidate of its own in every constituency in the state. 
Congress expects to do well in states where it is the main opposition to a vulnerable incumbent government, for example, in Andhra Pradesh. But gains in such states may not offset losses in Maharashtra, where Congress must now split its vote with Mr Pawar's Nationalist Congress Party. 
Congress suffers, too, from having fewer potential allies than the BJP. That is not because its ideology is off-putting: many of the BJP's friends find Congress's secular outlook more congenial. Rather, Congress lacks allies because it is strong in more states, which means it is a threat to more state-based parties. Many of these are striking seat-sharing deals with the BJP to keep anti-Congress votes together: allies usually grow awkward after elections. The BJP wonders how it will get on with an assertive new grouping of three left-leaning parties, which merged without consulting the leader of the National Democratic Alliance. 
If the BJP has its way, voters will treat this election as an interruption. Mr Vajpayee's masterful prime-ministerial performance will resume, strengthened perhaps by more seats in Parliament. Many people would find that a reassuring outcome, but not everyone. The BJP's diehard foes believe that every success it enjoys brings closer the day when the pro-Hindu party can rule on its own, imperilling India's pluralist culture.

Bollywood movies with titles like ""I Swear by India"" cater to Indians flush with their victory over Pakistani intruders in Kashmir. The prime minister, Atal Behari Vajpayee, who faces a general election next month, is pandering to the same audience. The downing of a Pakistani naval reconnaissance aeroplane last week serves notice that India will punish any breaches of its borders. 
In Pakistan the mood is equally patriotic, but hardly triumphant. Its withdrawal last month from India's side of the line of control in Kashmir was humiliating; the downing of its aircraft, in which 16 people died, infuriating. Nawaz Sharif, the embattled prime minister, said that further aggression would be met with ""a telling response"". He is under pressure to do more than bluster. 
The two prime ministers are trying to exploit the belligerence (in Mr Vajpayee's case) or survive it (in Mr Sharif's) without an allout war. India is savouring a diplomatic victory as well as a military one; it has no wish to jeopardise that by allowing tensions with Pakistan to flare out of control. A senior army officer notes that India's ""self-imposed restraint...was much appreciated"" during the Kashmir mini-war and that it would continue. For its part, Pakistan ""can't afford to annoy the Americans"" by allowing hostilities to rise too much, says Khalid Mahmud of the Institute of Regional Studies in Islamabad. There have even been hints of goodwill. India, for example, offered to release several prisoners-of-war on Pakistan's independence day. Despite the downing of Pakistan's aircraft, Mr Sharif wants to talk peace. 
Yet restraint still allows for plenty of bloodshed. Pakistan has returned to its old strategy of using freelance Islamic militants to destabilise Kashmir, but their tactics have changed. There now seem to be more of them (2,ooo-2,500, the Indian army guesses) and they are concentrating their attacks against Indian security forces. The army says that in the past week or so, 20 of its men have been killed. India also sees a Pakistani hand behind mounting acts of sabotage in Assam, a state in the north-east with a welter of insurrectionary movements. 
The new approach cleverly serves multiple purposes. It promotes Pakistan's traditional policy of making India's possession of Kashmir as painful as possible. It also counters ""Indian propaganda about killing innocent men and women,"" says Mr Mahmud. India is trying not to be bullied by Pakistan's demands or provoked by its violence. Mr Vajpayee says repeatedly that talks cannot resume while Pakistan continues to orchestrate ""terrorism"" in India. The foreign ministry is a mite less categorical: it says that Pakistan must take ""tangible steps"" towards ending terrorism before talking again. Until then, India has little recourse beyond fighting militants on its own territory. ""Everyone expects us to continue to take this,"" says the senior army officer quoted above. His hope is that international pressure will force Pakistan to stop. In any event, no serious talking will be done before India's election. 
Thus, the stalemate looks like continuing. Mr Sharif is unwilling to compound his humiliation in Kashmir by restraining militants there. Mr Vajpayee will continue to respond with shows of strength that attract votes but stop short of provoking war. He used his independence-day speech on August i5th to repeat a pledge to deploy the Agni 2, a long-range missile capable of carrying nuclear warheads. A draft nuclear doctrine, announced two days later, contained little that was new and much that was vague. India promised again not to use nuclear weapons first. It is to have a sophisticated (and very expensive) nuclear arsenal, deployed on land, in the air and at sea, which Pakistan is bound to try to match. It will all be under the control of the prime minister. 
India's national security adviser boasted that the two countries' nuclear arsenals had stopped the war in Kashmir from escalating into something worse.

SIR-Jeffrey Sachs has not considered that more than merely saving lives those lives should be worth living (By invitation, August 14th). Many poor countries are experiencing explosive population growth, far beyond their ability to provide a decent standard of living. Much of this is due to the effect of modem science, for example in health and agriculture. In addition, through a variety of policies, many of these countries encourage large families. The result of unrestrained growth includes poverty, ignorance, starvation, illness and early death. Implementing Mr Sachs's proposals would add to the population problem, and could cause even more misery. 
If poor countries are not willing and able to control their pop ulation growth, and raise living standards, it may not be possible to convince the rich ones to make the effort to save them. 
DAVID SHELDON 
Toronto 
SIR-Both you and my colleague Jeffrey Sachs agree that a lack of access to new medicines, protected by product patents, is a big problem. As you say, it can have dramatic consequences for welfare. While mortality rates for AIDS patients have plummeted in America and Europe, in the poor countries they are at alarmingly high rates, because of lack of access to new AIDS medicines. 
Monopoly prices reap huge rents for multinational firms in rich countries-a major market failure for the poorest of the poor. While Mr Sachs proposes a global incentive fund for future vaccine development there are no ideas on how to expand access to existing new medicines. 
Pharmaceutical companies say that high monopoly rents on new medicines assure incentives for high-risk research on future pathbreaking medicines and pay for past efforts that resulted in failure. But the vast majority of those medicines (successes and failures) have little relevance to the disease patterns in the poorest countries. Where is the ethical justification for charging rich-country prices for the new medicines that are relevant to poor countries when the profits subsidise research on diseases that have little relevance to them? Substantial price reductions or even donations of welfare-enhancing new medicines for poor countries are called for. 
MICHAEL REICH 
Harvard School of Public Health 
SIR-The ""shock"" free market economic policies espoused by Mr Sachs directly contributed to the impoverishment of many in the former Soviet Union and Eastem Europe after the collapse of Communism; having him write on ""helping the world's poorest"" is laden with irony. Mr Sachs's thesis-that impoverishment in highly indebted poor countries (Hipcs) is more a product of climate and recent weather patterns than exploitation by wealthier nations-is quite a piece of theoretical obscurantism. It also does nothing to explain the large gap in high-income countries between rich and poor, with some of the latter living in conditions nearly as bad as those in the HIPCS, despite inhabiting more temperate climes. 
That said, I agree with the four propositions for economic improvement Mr Sachs outlines. After they are instituted, maybe we can stop using developing countries in the way they have been used by colonial economies for hundreds of years: for the mass plunder of resources and labour.

Profiting online 
SIR-In Internet retailing established companies do have certain advantages over pure web companies, including offline brand awareness, market clout, marketing firepower and already existing distribution and fulfilment systems (""The real Internet revolution"", August 2ist). However, a huge problem faced by bricks-- and-mortar companies trying to sell online is that they risk outpricing their other ""real world"" distribution channels. 
You say that the online operation of Toys ""R"" Us is in jeopardy. The problem that it faces is that it is unable to match the markdowns of other Internet upstarts such as eToys (which generally sells below shop prices) because such a strategy would undercut its network of franchisees around the country. Also, preferential pricing could foster resentment by store managers. 
ROY RODRIGUES

Korea's missile 
SIR-At last, someone has asked the obvious question (""Countdown"", August 21st). If this summer we have had weeks of warning that North Korea might test a missile, how could the one it launched a year ago have come as such a surprise? Then as now, American spy satellites watched North Korea's every move. 
Reports at the time claimed that the Japanese government had advance warning of last year's launch and tried to get North Korea to call it off. But why did the Japanese government choose not to alert its citizens? And why did America not shout it from the rooftops, as it has this time? There are two answers. The allies hoped to see what Kim Jong I1 had in his arsenal, and to scare Japanese public opinion out of pacifism and into endorsing closer defence co-operation with America. Both aims have been amply fulfilled. 
As to North Korea's motives, your verdict of ""totally unpredictable"" is too defeatist. Last year, they let off a big firework for their 50th birthday. This year, it is the old North Korean ploy of going out on a limb in order to be rewarded for later backing off. It works every time.

Not to be sniffed at 
SIR-You say that the people of Halifax, Nova Scotia, have ""a useful lesson to teach the world"" about the passive smelling of perfumes and other scented toiletry products in public places (""Sense and non-scents"", August 7th) Unfortunately, your tongue-in-cheek comments suggest that you are unaware of a medical problem known as chemical sensitivity that increasingly complicates the lives of many people. 
For unfortunates who have developed this sensitivity a few seconds of smelling strong perfumes can cause severe physical reactions that may last for hours. A relative disaster might strike if a strongly scented person happens to be sitting in front of a chemically sensitive person on a bus, train or plane, and no alternative seating is available. I sincerely applaud the fine people of Halifax and can only hope that others become more aware that a pleasing scent for them may be anathema for another. 
MICHAEL CLARKE 
Cultus Lake, Canada 
Voting for growth 
SIR-Your ""Politics brief' on direct democracy (August 14th) ignores a crucial aspect, namely its effect on the economy. Over the past decades scholars have carried out serious econometric cross-section studies, using the fact that the voters in the 26 Swiss cantons have different opportunities for undertaking popular referendums and initiatives. In some cantons, for instance, almost any issue can be brought to the vote. In others, the set of issues is more restricted, for example, it excludes the budget. 
The result of more extended participation rights for voters is striking: cheaper and more efficient provision of public services; lower debt per person; higher income per person; and, most importantly, a happier population. The causation does indeed run from direct democracy to these outcomes, not the other way round, and no other factors are responsible. Direct democracy is even more beneficial than you suggest. 
BRUNO FREY 
Zurich 
SIR-Democracy must be a means not an end, and that end is liberty. Untamed democracy is the enemy of liberty. The tyranny of a majority is as oppressive as the tyranny of a central committee. Direct democracy is not a good answer to any of our problems (however, as in California of late, it may be a necessary evil when elected politicians refuse to deal with difficult issues). 
Democracy must be surrounded by non democratic elements-- extraordinary majorities, executive vetoes, judicial review, constitutions, bills of rights, etc, to prevent it from becoming tyrannical. Tempered democracy is the surest instrument we have yet seen to ensure liberty. 
JOHN AHLSTROM 
Cupertino, California 
India's election 
SIR-The days of Jawaharlal Nehru, Indira Gandhi or even Rajiv Gandhi are over for the Congress party; it now exhibits signs of being a spent force (""The battle for India"", August 14th). Instead of being on the offensive during the run-up to the forthcoming parliamentary elections the party is expending lots of time and energy defending its nomination of Sonia Gandhi, a foreigner by birth, as the next prime minister of India. 
Sharad Pawar, a political heavyweight, left the Congress party weakening its stronghold in the premier state of Maharashtra. Ironically, the induction of Jayalalitha Jayaram, the ""erratic Tamil Nadu politician"", into an alliance has further diminished the party's credibility instead of compensating it for the loss of Mr Pawar because of a slew of corruption charges against her and her unprincipled role in bringing down a functioning government on unsubstantiated charges. 
In the final analysis, what works in India during election time is a sort of fuzzy logic not cold analysis. Atal Behari Vajpayee's Bjp-led alliance may win the elections not because of the military and diplomatic victory in Kargil, nor on account of low inflation in the Indian economy, nor even because his party is far less corrupt, but because of his skills as an orator and his frequent dalliance with mellifluous poetry in Hindi when he reaches out to the masses. 
KANGAYAM RANGASWAMY 
Maryland Heights, Missouri 
Youth-hostile 
SIR-I fail to see how America can be seen as having a youth-oriented culture (Lexington, August 14th). The country is dominated by repressive anti-youth politicians who have forgotten what it is like to be young. Too many of the 1960s baby-boomers have turned on their successors; one of them is in the White House. Bill Clinton launched a hysterical and hypocritical ""war on drugs""; supports the wearing of school uniforms and curfews on young people; and has used the power of the federal government against states wanting to lower the drinking age from a ludicrously high 21. 
Personal freedom is more important than the paranoid and petty-minded justifications for these curtailments of liberty. Sixteen-year-olds should be given the same rights as adults. 
MARK TAHA 
London 
SIR-Your article on the horrors of youth could not have been more appropriate at a time when the mainstream media flash stories which portray the youth of America as mysterious criminals with increasingly violent tendencies. As a i7-year-old, I am dismayed by the ongoing search for the causes of this ""new violence"" among children and teenagers. 
Perhaps the tabloids should search for the cause of violence among our adults. The real mystery is the motive behind such policies as America's support of governments who oppress their own people or the bombing of innocent civilians (which is somehow deemed both effective and humane). 
ARISTON-LIZABETH ANDERSON 
Jackson, Mississippi 
Options for change 
SIR-You comment that option-- pricing theory is likely to replace the ""Capital Asset Pricing Model"" only when the majority of managers have doctorates in applied mathematics (Economics focus, August 14th). It would be a pity if this were true, as decision making in business is crying out for better financial tools. 
Much of the apparent complexity of current approaches to ""real-options analysis"" arises from the attempt to fit financial-- option formulae to real-world problems. Usually, this does not work as real-world options are often quite different from financial options. Option-pricing formulae are treated as a procrustean bed by academics: either the real world is simplified beyond recognition or unwarranted assumptions are added to make the facts fit the theory. Neither approach satisfies managers. 
There is an alternative. Simple financial models can capture the essence of option value by directly incorporating managers' existing knowledge of uncertainty and their possible decisions in the future. This approach avoids the dangers of complex formulae and unwarranted assumptions, and gives a lot more management insight than black-box formulae while creating less opportunity for academic publications. 
It seems a pity to dismiss a major advance in financial decisionmaking just because academia has not found ways to make it practical. 
STEPHEN BLACK 
Cambridge 
SIR-In theory, the greater the volatility in the price of an underlying asset, the more valuable the option to buy it. The greater the price variation, the greater the range of choice for the optionholder, and the greater his profit from choosing the right moment to buy. 
The world oil price fell 65% between October 1996 and December 1998. By July 1999 it had risen by i2%. Despite this increase in price variability, the values of various options-unimproved acreage, proved undeveloped reserves, exploration ahead of development-did not rise but apparently kept falling. 
This does not prove option theory wrong, but its limits are severe. When the price variability is not due to chance and may change for unknown reasons, we are, for now, back where we started: more uncertainty means lower values and less investment. 
M.A. ADELMAN 
Cambridge, Massachusetts 
Digital and the BBC 
SIR-Your articles on the BBC (August 7th) fail to mention the most important reason why the additional licence fee for digital TV viewers should be rejected; we already pay extra to view digital TV. It is the analogue viewers who should be taxed; they watch TV free to air (except for the standard licence fee). To charge us more just because we are already paying more defies all logic or justice. 
That digital viewers rarely watch the BBC merely strengthens this sense of injustice. Viewers should have freedom to choose packages that do not include the BBC, and if they cannot receive the BBC they should not have to pay the licence fee. 
CHRISTOPH BLUTH 
Leeds 
SIR-You suggest that the homes most likely to take digital services are more affluent and therefore politically more ""palatable"" for the government to tax. This assumption is misplaced. All the evidence from our tracking of the market shows that the homes most likely to have taken up digital TV (or intending to) are overwhelmingly traditional heavyviewing homes. The view that a digital tax would be largely sourced from the rich, enabling the government to ""get away with it"" is wrong; the tax will be mainly paid by ordinary families.

 SIR - In Internet retailing established companies do have certain advantages over pure web companies , including offline brand awareness , market clout , marketing firepower and already existing distribution and fulfilment systems ( "" The real Internet revolution "" , August 2ist ) . However , a huge problem faced by bricks-- and - mortar companies trying to sell online is that they risk outpricing their other "" real world "" distribution channels . 
 You say that the online operation of Toys "" R "" Us is in jeopardy . The problem that it faces is that it is unable to match the markdowns of other Internet upstarts such as eToys ( which generally sells below shop prices ) because such a strategy would undercut its network of franchisees around the country . Also , preferential pricing could foster resentment by store managers .

 Korea 's missile 
 SIR - At last , someone has asked the obvious question ( "" Countdown "" , August 21st ) . If this summer we have had weeks of warning that North Korea might test a missile , how could the one it launched a year ago have come as such a surprise ? Then as now , American spy satellites watched North Korea 's every move . 
 Reports at the time claimed that the Japanese government had advance warning of last year 's launch and tried to get North Korea to call it off . But why did the Japanese government choose not to alert its citizens ? And why did America not shout it from the rooftops , as it has this time ? There are two answers . The allies hoped to see what Kim Jong I1 had in his arsenal , and to scare Japanese public opinion out of pacifism and into endorsing closer defence co - operation with America . Both aims have been amply fulfilled . 
 As to North Korea 's motives , your verdict of "" totally unpredictable "" is too defeatist . Last year , they let off a big firework for their 50th birthday . This year , it is the old North Korean ploy of going out on a limb in order to be rewarded for later backing off . It works every time .

 Not to be sniffed at 
 SIR - You say that the people of Halifax , Nova Scotia , have "" a useful lesson to teach the world "" about the passive smelling of perfumes and other scented toiletry products in public places ( "" Sense and non - scents "" , August 7th ) Unfortunately , your tongue - in - cheek comments suggest that you are unaware of a medical problem known as chemical sensitivity that increasingly complicates the lives of many people . 
 For unfortunates who have developed this sensitivity a few seconds of smelling strong perfumes can cause severe physical reactions that may last for hours . A relative disaster might strike if a strongly scented person happens to be sitting in front of a chemically sensitive person on a bus , train or plane , and no alternative seating is available . I sincerely applaud the fine people of Halifax and can only hope that others become more aware that a pleasing scent for them may be anathema for another .

 Voting for growth 
 SIR - Your "" Politics brief ' on direct democracy ( August 14th ) ignores a crucial aspect , namely its effect on the economy . Over the past decades scholars have carried out serious econometric cross - section studies , using the fact that the voters in the 26 Swiss cantons have different opportunities for undertaking popular referendums and initiatives . In some cantons , for instance , almost any issue can be brought to the vote . In others , the set of issues is more restricted , for example , it excludes the budget . 
 The result of more extended participation rights for voters is striking : cheaper and more efficient provision of public services ; lower debt per person ; higher income per person ; and , most importantly , a happier population . The causation does indeed run from direct democracy to these outcomes , not the other way round , and no other factors are responsible . Direct democracy is even more beneficial than you suggest . 
 BRUNO FREY 
 Zurich 
 SIR - Democracy must be a means not an end , and that end is liberty . Untamed democracy is the enemy of liberty . The tyranny of a majority is as oppressive as the tyranny of a central committee . Direct democracy is not a good answer to any of our problems ( however , as in California of late , it may be a necessary evil when elected politicians refuse to deal with difficult issues ) . 
 Democracy must be surrounded by non democratic elements-- extraordinary majorities , executive vetoes , judicial review , constitutions , bills of rights , etc , to prevent it from becoming tyrannical . Tempered democracy is the surest instrument we have yet seen to ensure liberty .

 India 's election 
 SIR - The days of Jawaharlal Nehru , Indira Gandhi or even Rajiv Gandhi are over for the Congress party ; it now exhibits signs of being a spent force ( "" The battle for India "" , August 14th ) . Instead of being on the offensive during the run - up to the forthcoming parliamentary elections the party is expending lots of time and energy defending its nomination of Sonia Gandhi , a foreigner by birth , as the next prime minister of India . 
 Sharad Pawar , a political heavyweight , left the Congress party weakening its stronghold in the premier state of Maharashtra . Ironically , the induction of Jayalalitha Jayaram , the "" erratic Tamil Nadu politician "" , into an alliance has further diminished the party 's credibility instead of compensating it for the loss of Mr Pawar because of a slew of corruption charges against her and her unprincipled role in bringing down a functioning government on unsubstantiated charges . 
 In the final analysis , what works in India during election time is a sort of fuzzy logic not cold analysis . Atal Bihari Vajpayee's Bjp - led alliance may win the elections not because of the military and diplomatic victory in Kargil , nor on account of low inflation in the Indian economy , nor even because Atal Bihari Vajpayee's party is far less corrupt , but because of Atal Bihari Vajpayee's skills as an orator and Atal Bihari Vajpayee's frequent dalliance with mellifluous poetry in Hindi when Atal Bihari Vajpayee reaches out to the masses .

 Youth - hostile 
 SIR - I fail to see how America can be seen as having a youth - oriented culture ( Lexington , August 14th ) . The country is dominated by repressive anti - youth politicians who have forgotten what it is like to be young . Too many of the 1960s baby - boomers have turned on their successors ; one of them is in the White House . Bill Clinton launched a hysterical and hypocritical "" war on drugs "" ; supports the wearing of school uniforms and curfews on young people ; and has used the power of the federal government against states wanting to lower the drinking age from a ludicrously high 21 . 
 Personal freedom is more important than the paranoid and petty - minded justifications for these curtailments of liberty . Sixteen - year - olds should be given the same rights as adults . 
 MARK TAHA

 SIR - Your article on the horrors of youth could not have been more appropriate at a time when the mainstream media flash stories which portray the youth of America as mysterious criminals with increasingly violent tendencies . As a i7 - year - old , I am dismayed by the ongoing search for the causes of this "" new violence "" among children and teenagers . 
 Perhaps the tabloids should search for the cause of violence among our adults . The real mystery is the motive behind such policies as America 's support of governments who oppress their own people or the bombing of innocent civilians ( which is somehow deemed both effective and humane ) .

 Options for change 
 SIR - You comment that option-- pricing theory is likely to replace the "" Capital Asset Pricing Model "" only when the majority of managers have doctorates in applied mathematics ( Economics focus , August 14th ) . It would be a pity if this were true , as decision making in business is crying out for better financial tools . 
 Much of the apparent complexity of current approaches to "" real - options analysis "" arises from the attempt to fit financial-- option formulae to real - world problems . Usually , this does not work as real - world options are often quite different from financial options . Option - pricing formulae are treated as a procrustean bed by academics : either the real world is simplified beyond recognition or unwarranted assumptions are added to make the facts fit the theory . Neither approach satisfies managers . 
 There is an alternative . Simple financial models can capture the essence of option value by directly incorporating managers ' existing knowledge of uncertainty and their possible decisions in the future . This approach avoids the dangers of complex formulae and unwarranted assumptions , and gives a lot more management insight than black - box formulae while creating less opportunity for academic publications . 
 It seems a pity to dismiss a major advance in financial decisionmaking just because academia has not found ways to make it practical . 
 STEPHEN BLACK 
 Cambridge 
 SIR - In theory , the greater the volatility in the price of an underlying asset , the more valuable the option to buy it . The greater the price variation , the greater the range of choice for the optionholder , and the greater his profit from choosing the right moment to buy . 
 The world oil price fell 65 % between October 1996 and December 1998 . By July 1999 it had risen by i2 % . Despite this increase in price variability , the values of various options - unimproved acreage , proved undeveloped reserves , exploration ahead of development - did not rise but apparently kept falling . 
 This does not prove option theory wrong , but its limits are severe . When the price variability is not due to chance and may change for unknown reasons , we are , for now , back where we started : more uncertainty means lower values and less investment .

 Digital and the BBC 
 SIR - Your articles on the BBC ( August 7th ) fail to mention the most important reason why the additional licence fee for digital TV viewers should be rejected ; we already pay extra to view digital TV . It is the analogue viewers who should be taxed ; they watch TV free to air ( except for the standard licence fee ) . To charge us more just because we are already paying more defies all logic or justice . 
 That digital viewers rarely watch the BBC merely strengthens this sense of injustice . Viewers should have freedom to choose packages that do not include the BBC , and if they can not receive the BBC they should not have to pay the licence fee . 
 CHRISTOPH BLUTH 
 Leeds 
 SIR - You suggest that the homes most likely to take digital services are more affluent and therefore politically more "" palatable "" for the government to tax . This assumption is misplaced . All the evidence from our tracking of the market shows that the homes most likely to have taken up digital TV ( or intending to ) are overwhelmingly traditional heavyviewing homes . The view that a digital tax would be largely sourced from the rich , enabling the government to "" get away with it "" is wrong ; the tax will be mainly paid by ordinary families .

FOR a country with a billion people and a nuclear bomb, India does not count for much in the world. Its trade accounts for 0.7% of the world total; it gets about one-tenth the foreign direct investment that China attracts. It has no permanent seat on the UN Security Council. When pundits talk about the geo-strategic chessboard of the future, India has figured more often as a bishop or a knight than as a queen. On this view, India is the world's biggest under-achiever. 
There are many ways to count for something, not all them constructive-think of over-achieving Iraq and North Korea. But the sort of influence India aspires to is more positive. It would come from being,an economic power to be reckoned with, a motor of development in a region encompassing a fifth of humanity, much of it living in poverty, and from being a peacemaker in its neighbourhood and beyond. That is what is at stake in the general election that begins on September 5th (see page 29), though you would not know it from the vicious vacuity of the campaign so far. Voters are hoping to end the political instability that has given them five prime ministers in less than four years. If they succeed-a big if-the next incumbent will have more time than his (or her) recent predecessors to ponder why India is performing so far below its potential. But what should be done about it? 
Better but not good enough 
To list the causes of India's inconsequence makes their eradication seem an overwhelming task. A third of the population is poor and just a fifth can be classified, on a loose definition, as middle class; 40% are illiterate. India's infrastructure is a joke, politicians and bureaucrats are as often parasites as public servants, girls are denied equal access to education, subsidies and loss-making firms gobble up public resources...and so on and on. Each problem is an aggregate of myriad others, and each of those is perpetuated by some lobby that would be worse off if it were solved. The prime minister can address only some of these directly. The main parties promise in their manifestos to tackle them all. 
That is, at least, an improvement. India did change during the i99os, under several different prime ministers, breaking taboos that had kept it in unsplendid isolation from the rest of the world. A consensus, more or less, supports the modest relaxation of the state's grip on the economy that has taken place. Recently, there has been political improvement, too. Last year, the government led by the kindly figure of Atal Behari Vajpayee began its tenure by earning nearly universal opprobrium for proclaiming India's nuclear capabilities with a series of blasts. But this year it enlisted widespread support for its successful effort to evict Pakistani invaders from Kashmir, and Mr Vajpayee emerged with his reputation enhanced. 
That mini-war with Pakistan in Kashmir was both reassuring and frightening: reassuring because India understood the risks of nuclear confrontation well enough to avoid escalating the conflict, frightening because nuclear war remains a risk as long as either of the old enemies views war of any kind as an option. The next government will have the job of clarifying its nuclear doctrine (a draft of which was recently announced) to ensure that its deterrent is both safe and affordable. A conventional arms build-up is already on the cards after the flare-up in Kashmir; on top of that, the last thing the subcontinent needs is a nuclear arms race. India has already indicated that it has tested enough nuclear weapons; it should enter the international arms-control regime by signing the comprehensive test-ban treaty. And it must search for a way to put relations with its unstable, aggressive neighbour on a less-perilous footing. 
The second sort of engagement with the world that India needs is economic. India has done well out of the first phase of economic reform, begun in 1991. The ""Hindu rate of growth"" is now no longer 3% but 5-6%. Import liberalisation dramatically improved the terms of trade for agriculture, still the mainstay of the economy. A world-class software industry has sprung up from almost nothing. New opportunities beckon in ""remote services"", like call centres, and traditional industries, like textiles. Both main contenders for power (Mr Vajpayee's Bharatiya Janata Party and Sonia Gandhi's Congress party) have set targets of 7-8% for growth and $10 billion a year, about three times the current total, for foreign direct investment. The aPr has gone quiet about swadeshi (self reliance), except in so far as it applies to politicians of foreign origin, like the Italian-born Mrs Gandhi. Her party promises to cut India's tariffs, which are still high by international standards, to the levels of South-East Asia within three years. 
So far, so promising. There is a big difference, however, between setting a direction and setting the pace, and a still bigger one between making a decision and ensuring that it is carried out. Globalisation involves not just opening an economy but equipping it to take full advantage of opportunities in world markets. In India's case that involves privatising, deregulating, chopping subsidies and a host of other measures that the political parties have shown little stomach for. Without them, the economy will not reach those hoped-for 8% growth rates. Manifesto promises like ""education for all"" and ""universal"" access to drinking water show that the many and various parties understand what is required to spread the benefits of growth to all Indians, but not what it takes actually to make these things happen. 
One of the problems is that politicians do not, as a rule, come to New Delhi burning with impatience to better their country. Election to parliament or appointment to the cabinet and the patronage that this brings are victory enough for their state or caste, many seem to think. That is a shame, and has been a big contributor to India's tragedy. Much has been achieved in India. But the tragedy is that so much more should have been and could have been. Hundreds of millions of poor, stunted lives are the proof. Whoever leads India once the votes have been counted on October 6th must have that firmly in their mind.

WHEN India goes to the polls it is normally a brash, colourful affair, with something of the buzz of a Hindu religious festival. But an air of weariness hangs over the general election that begins on September 5th and stretches through early October. It is the third in little more than three years; people are quite simply tired of voting. As in many countries, ideological strife has died down. Voters face a choice between two blocks--one headed by the Bharatiya Janata Party (Bjp), a Hindu nationalist party which now leads the government, the other by the Congress party-which offer roughly the same things: tolerance towards religious minorities (""secularism"" in Indian parlance promises of mild economic reform coupled with spectacular economic progress, and vigilance in defence of India's borders. Perhaps voters have also concluded that the wielder of power in New Delhi has little effect on their welfare, which seems to depend more on monsoon rains than on politicians they never see. 
Yet the next prime minister chosen by India's 6o5m voters ought to be able to make more of a difference than that. The Chinese president may govern more people, but India's billion also have urgent material needs. A half-dozen countries have more nuclear weapons than India, yet none of the big nuclear powers is as likely to be tempted to use them. In terms of influence on world affairs, probably no other country is so far below its potential. The next prime minister matters to Indians because his policies (or hers) will determine how rapidly their welfare improves. For the rest of the world he will set the pace for India's emergence as more of a power to be reckoned with. 
The new consensus among political parties is basically healthy. It suggests that India has resolved quarrels about the basic thrust of economic policy, though the agreed-upon pace of reform is still too timid. The main parties have set aside-for the time being at least-the sometimes bloody argument over how to balance the rights of the Hindu majority with those of minorities, especially Muslims. The maturity of rhetoric is matched by a maturing of the economy. 
Thanks to liberalisation in the early 1990s, the economy seems capable of sustaining a growth rate of 6% or so. After i8 months in which India proclaimed its nuclear capabilities by exploding several atomic devices and then fought a brief war with Pakistan, there are hints of a new consensus in foreign policy. The traditional mistrust of the United States is fading; relations with China are improving. ""There is a consensus on most things in India,"" says Arun Shourie, one of the Bjp's leading intellectuals. The fight among parties is to ""convince the electorate that you can deliver on that consensus."" 
And that is where India has fallen down. Indian democracy has lately been incapable of producing stable majorities (in the past four years, there have been four non-Congress prime ministers, points out the Congress party manifesto). Its administrative failings are of an older vintage. Inefficiency, corruption, an absence of accountability and other forms of mismanagement have hurt everything from schools to roads to foreign investment. Agreement about policy gives India's next government a chance to concentrate on good management, of everything from its nuclear arsenal and fiscal deficits to railways. Broad consensus does not make it easy: it is one thing to accept the principle of privatisation, another to enrage people by doing it purposefully. The most important battles ahead will be unglamorous ones over implementation. Voters may not look at it that way, but they are choosing India's next manager-in-chief. 
Elector beware 
It is not a job for which either leading candidate looks suited. For the BJP, Atal Behari Vajpayee, the current prime minister, has less than two years of executive experience (though he was foreign minister in a previous government). Sonia Gandhi, the Italian-born president of the Congress party, has none. 
Nor is Indian democracy a breeding ground for managers. The party system is, to oversimplify, an agglomeration of separate party systems in two dozen states. It produces leaders with narrow horizons and little vision. They tend to build followings by forming coalitions among communities, usually castes, and try to hold on to them through patronage. In an era of fractured national parliaments, even a few seats in New Delhi give these regional barons great clout. But this also exposes them to intense temptations. As the fight for a place at the feast becomes increasingly desperate, ""every party has cast all norms to the wind,"" says one MP, who guesses that 70% of politicians in India's various parliaments are on the take. 
All this leads to accusations against many people, like Laloo Prasad Yadav, the rough-and-tumble leader of the biggest party in Bihar, the second most-populous and poorest state, and Jayalalitha Jayaram, from the southern state of Tamil Nadu, whose prima donna-like tantrums tortured then toppled the last government. Both are fighting corruption charges; neither could be accused of being a technocrat. One of the few who could be, Chandrabadu Naidu, chief minister of the southern state of Andhra Pradesh, may lose his job in the state election, to be held at the same time as the national one. 
Yet Indian politics may be settling down to stabler and, eventually, better government. The parliamentary free-for-all seems to be giving way to a two-front system in which majorities will be less breakable, with a growing consensus on issues that used to tear India apart. This is largely the work of the BJP, which realised that to manufacture winning coalitions it would have to move towards the centre. Its current campaign is the culmination of that strategy. 
The BJP began the 1990s as India's most divisive party (bar Shiv Sena, one of its smaller allies). It championed the idea that Hindutva--Hinduness-is the unifying ethos of India. That went along with the belief that India had betrayed its Hindu majority by pandering too much to its minorities, especially Muslims. Hindutva had an economic dimension,too: swadeshi, or self-reliance. In 199o L. K. Advani, now the home minister, proclaimed Hindu unity from a jeep-borne chariot that travelled to,ooo kilometres (6,ooo miles) across India, triggering communal violence in dozens of cities. The Hindu pride campaign peaked in 1992 with the demolition of the Babri mosque in Ayodhya, in Uttar Pradesh, which supposedly trespassed on the birthplace of the god Ram. In the ensuing riots, 1,200 people died. 
The BJP was then not so much a conventional political party as the political division of a many fronted Hindu-nationalist movement led by the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (Association of National Volunteers, or Rss). The BJP won millions of converts by championing the Hindu cause, especially among middle-class city dwellers in the ""cow belt"" of northern states like Uttar Pradesh and Rajasthan. But, especially after the destruction of the Babri mosque, it alienated millions more-Muslims in particular but also members of lower castes, southerners and anyone who believed in the secular ideals of the first prime minister, Jawaharlal Nehru. Hindutva took the BJP only so far. 
Since Ayodhya it has moved towards the political centre, attacking on safe issues like corruption and poor governance. It won the largest number of seats in last year's general election but could govern only with the cooperation of more than a dozen other groupings that wanted no truck with its ""communal"" agenda. It wooed them by stifling its ideology. That coalition collapsed in April, but the sP has lost faith neither in consensus nor coalition. It is campaigning for re-election at the head of a 22-party National Democratic Alliance (NDA). Its own manifesto has been shelved in favour of a joint programme that promises a moratorium on ""contentious issues"" (like building a Hindu temple where the Babri mosque once stood). 
This Faustian decision permits the Bjp to shop, state by state, for alliances with parties that would otherwise split the vote against Congress, its main national rival. In West Bengal, for example, it has hooked up with Trinamul Congress, a breakaway from the Congress party that has substantial Muslim support. In Andhra Pradesh it has come to a seat-sharing arrangement with Mr Naidu's Telegu Desam Party, a regional party whose main rival for power in the state is Congress. And so on across the map. In all, the BJP is expected to contest just 330 of the 543 seats in parliament, leaving the rest this time to fellow members of the NDA and other allies. Hail to the chief 
This is India's characteristic way of building maities from its natchwork of castes. language groups and states. The NDA has added to that a national gloss to attract floating voters and motivate committed ones. It has given the 22-headed alliance a single face, that of Mr Maj payee. He portrays himself as a bulwark against ideologues in the Bjp and has long been more popular than his party. According to a recent poll in India Today, a weekly magazine,just it% of those who support him do so because of his party. All ten photographs in the NDA'S election manifesto are of him. 
That presidential tactic would not work half so well if Mr Vajpayee had not scored a last-minute presidential triumph. He spent much of his first year in power looking like a helpless school teacher trying to instil some discipline in an unruly classroom. That image was buried in July by India's defeat of Pakistani invaders in Kashmir, India's only Muslim-majority state. The BjP-led alliance has exploited this to the hilt, sometimes beyond what the election commission deems proper. It gives the alliance an issue around which it can rally floating voters.It makes raising the issue of Mrs Gandhi's Italian origins seem less xenophobic. It helps the BJP rebrand itself as a party of inclusive nationalism rather than exclusive sectarianism. 
Congress faithful must feel a bit like British Conservatives before their loss to ""New"" Labour in 1997. ""New"" Be has stolen their secular ideology. Mr Vajpayee has acquired the charisma that once belonged to members of Mrs Gandhi's dynasty: her martyred husband, Rajiv, his martyred mother, Indira, and Indira's father, Jawaharlal Nehru. The opinion polls are unanimous in predicting a majority for Mr Vajpayee and the NDA. 
Congress has helped them out with blunders and gaffes. The most damaging came in May, when three Congress leaders, including Sharad Pawar, head of the parliamentary party and its top gun in Maharashtra, said that no one born abroad (like Mrs Gandhi) should become prime minister. The party expelled them. They struck back by forming their own Nationalist Congress Party. That will hurt Congress in Maharashtra, which elected more Congress Mps than any other state last year. Pettier mistakes have followed. Mrs Gandhi tried to throw the media off her scent when she slipped away to the southern state of Karnataka to register her candidacy for one of the two parliamentary seats she is contesting. The Bjp got wind of her plans and sent down a high-profile female candidate to belittle Mrs Gandhi for her Italian birth, while Mr Vajpayee remained above the fray. Such misjudgments are commonly blamed not on Mrs Gandhi herself but on the ""courtiers"" who surround her. ""Sonia has some flair for judgment,"" says one Congressman, ""but it is blunted by limited access."" 
But hold on. Indian elections are not national referendums but summings-up of contests in some two dozen states (plus various territories). Congress is a force in more of them than any other party. ""Don't yet believe the opinion polls,"" says Ashutosh Varshney, a scholar at Columbia University in New York. ""It is likely to be the most competitive election ever:' 
One development that could make it so would be a resurgence of the Bjp's sectarian impulses, despite Mr Vajpayee's efforts to suppress them. Party leaders have lately been reassuring the faithful that shibboleths like the demand for a Hindu temple in Ayodhya will not be abandoned, merely set aside until the BJP can rule on its own. The attempt to reassure Rss activists without upsetting other parties in the National Democratic Alliance or the voters has led to a lot of doubletalk from BJP leaders. Congress hopes these glimpses of the old BjP will scare its traditional supporters back into the fold. 
Congress's campaign is an awkward blend of the old politics and the new. To the N[A'S claim that it is ""the political arm...of the Indian people"", Congress responds that a limb with so many joints is useless. A party of coalitions offers a better prospect of stable govemment than a coalition of parties, runs Congress's pitch. Its biggest test will come in Uttar Pradesh, the most-populous state, where new politics gave Congress a drubbing last time. Upper castes voted mainly for the BjP; another party swept up Muslim and middle-caste votes; dalits (formerly untouchables) backed a party of their own. Congress failed to win a seat. It is hoping that a mix of state issues (disillusionment with Uttar Pradesh's sJP-led government) and national ones (the lure of one-party government and fear of the BJP's Hindu agenda)will restore its traditional coalition. 
Elsewhere, Congress has had to admit that it cannot prosper on its own. It has struck seat-sharing deals with two of the most awkward political partners, Mr Yadav in Bihar and Miss Jayalalitha in Tamil Nadu. Unless Congress does far better than anyone expects, their parties would join Mrs Gandhi in any Congress-led government. 
Less of a third way 
Though government by coalition (or, conceivably, by Congress alone with outside support) looks inevitable, instability is not. There are a few reasons to hope that the next government may last longer than its recent predecessors. One is the decline of the ""third force"", a loose grouping of parties opposed to both the BJP and Congress. Until only recently it might have been able to form a government. Now, despite the creation of Mr Pawar's Nationalist Congress Party, it seems to be unravelling and its presence in parliament has declined. The Janata Dal, once the linchpin of the third force, has merged with two members of the National Democratic Alliance. Jaipal Reddy, a Janata Dal MP less trustful of the Bjp's new-found secularism than his party colleagues, decided to join Congress because ""no viable third front will emerge in the foreseeable future"". 
No one can be sure now how stable the next ruling front is likely to be. It will be more so if its majority is large, and if the main party within it has a big share of the seats. The NDA has been helped by the exit of Miss Jayalalitha; many of its constituents are rivals with Congress for power at state level, and so have little incentive to defect to the Congress-led front. Pran Chopra, a political analyst at the Centre for Policy Research, thinks that ""neither [front] has the credentials to be cohesive, but the N[)A'S chances are slightly better."" 
The alliance is calling for new measures to improve its chances. One of these would bar the premature dissolution of parliament (which might have the unintended effect of encouraging parties to break coalitions secure in the knowledge that they will not face an election). Another reform would require no-confidence motions to be ""constructive"" in the German style, ie, paired to a vote for an alternative government. 
Stability would be a good start, but it is only a start. A government worried about where its next majority will come from will avoid risk. A more secure government would have an opportunity to be bolder. Consensus points India in the right direction. However it will take not just a stable government but a bold and determined one to drive the country where it needs to go. ","India badly needs more stable government and better management . With luck , this month 's general election will open the way 
 WHEN India goes to the polls it is normally a brash , colourful affair , with something of the buzz of a Hindu religious festival . But an air of weariness hangs over the general election that begins on September 5th and stretches through early October . It is the third in little more than three years ; people are quite simply tired of voting . As in many countries , ideological strife has died down . Voters face a choice between two blocks -- one headed by the Bharatiya Janata Party ( Bjp ) , a Hindu nationalist party which now leads the government , the other by the Congress party - which offer roughly the same things : tolerance towards religious minorities ( "" secularism "" in Indian parlance promises of mild economic reform coupled with spectacular economic progress , and vigilance in defence of India 's borders . Perhaps voters have also concluded that the wielder of power in New Delhi has little effect on their welfare , which seems to depend more on monsoon rains than on politicians they never see . 
 Yet the next prime minister chosen by India 's 6o5 m voters ought to be able to make more of a difference than that . The Chinese president may govern more people , but India 's billion also have urgent material needs . A half - dozen countries have more nuclear weapons than India , yet none of the big nuclear powers is as likely to be tempted to use them . In terms of influence on world affairs , probably no other country is so far below its potential . The next prime minister matters to Indians because his policies ( or hers ) will determine how rapidly their welfare improves . For the rest of the world he will set the pace for India 's emergence as more of a power to be reckoned with . 
 The new consensus among political parties is basically healthy . It suggests that India has resolved quarrels about the basic thrust of economic policy , though the agreed - upon pace of reform is still too timid . The main parties have set aside - for the time being at least - the sometimes bloody argument over how to balance the rights of the Hindu majority with those of minorities , especially Muslims . The maturity of rhetoric is matched by a maturing of the economy . 
 Thanks to liberalisation in the early 1990s , the economy seems capable of sustaining a growth rate of 6 % or so . After i8 months in which India proclaimed its nuclear capabilities by exploding several atomic devices and then fought a brief war with Pakistan , there are hints of a new consensus in foreign policy . The traditional mistrust of the United States is fading ; relations with China are improving . "" There is a consensus on most things in India , "" says Arun Shourie , one of the Bjp 's leading intellectuals . The fight among parties is to "" convince the electorate that you can deliver on that consensus . "" 
 And that is where India has fallen down . Indian democracy has lately been incapable of producing stable majorities ( in the past four years , there have been four non - Congress prime ministers , points out the Congress party manifesto ) . Its administrative failings are of an older vintage . Inefficiency , corruption , an absence of accountability and other forms of mismanagement have hurt everything from schools to roads to foreign investment . Agreement about policy gives India 's next government a chance to concentrate on good management , of everything from its nuclear arsenal and fiscal deficits to railways . Broad consensus does not make it easy : it is one thing to accept the principle of privatisation , another to enrage people by doing it purposefully . The most important battles ahead will be unglamorous ones over implementation . Voters may not look at it that way , but they are choosing India 's next manager - in - chief . 
 Elector beware 
 It is not a job for which either leading candidate looks suited . For the BJP , Atal Bihari Vajpayee has less than two years of executive experience ( though Atal Bihari Vajpayee was foreign minister in a previous government ) . Sonia Gandhi , the Italian - born president of the Congress party , has none . 
 Nor is Indian democracy a breeding ground for managers . The party system is , to oversimplify , an agglomeration of separate party systems in two dozen states . It produces leaders with narrow horizons and little vision . They tend to build followings by forming coalitions among communities , usually castes , and try to hold on to them through patronage . In an era of fractured national parliaments , even a few seats in New Delhi give these regional barons great clout . But this also exposes them to intense temptations . As the fight for a place at the feast becomes increasingly desperate , "" every party has cast all norms to the wind , "" says one MP , who guesses that 70 % of politicians in India 's various parliaments are on the take . 
 All this leads to accusations against many people , like Laloo Prasad Yadav , the rough - and - tumble leader of the biggest party in Bihar , the second most - populous and poorest state , and Jayalalitha Jayaram , from the southern state of Tamil Nadu , whose prima donna - like tantrums tortured then toppled the last government . Both are fighting corruption charges ; neither could be accused of being a technocrat . One of the few who could be , Chandrabadu Naidu , chief minister of the southern state of Andhra Pradesh , may lose his job in the state election , to be held at the same time as the national one . 
 Yet Indian politics may be settling down to stabler and , eventually , better government . The parliamentary free - for - all seems to be giving way to a two - front system in which majorities will be less breakable , with a growing consensus on issues that used to tear India apart . This is largely the work of the BJP , which realised that to manufacture winning coalitions it would have to move towards the centre . Its current campaign is the culmination of that strategy . 
 The BJP began the 1990s as India 's most divisive party ( bar Shiv Sena , one of its smaller allies ) . It championed the idea that Hindutva -- Hinduness - is the unifying ethos of India . That went along with the belief that India had betrayed its Hindu majority by pandering too much to its minorities , especially Muslims . Hindutva had an economic dimension , too : swadeshi , or self - reliance . In 199o L. K. Advani , now the home minister , proclaimed Hindu unity from a jeep - borne chariot that travelled to , ooo kilometres ( 6,ooo miles ) across India , triggering communal violence in dozens of cities . The Hindu pride campaign peaked in 1992 with the demolition of the Babri mosque in Ayodhya , in Uttar Pradesh , which supposedly trespassed on the birthplace of the god Ram . In the ensuing riots , 1,200 people died . 
 The BJP was then not so much a conventional political party as the political division of a many fronted Hindu - nationalist movement led by the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh ( Association of National Volunteers , or Rss ) . The BJP won millions of converts by championing the Hindu cause , especially among middle - class city dwellers in the "" cow belt "" of northern states like Uttar Pradesh and Rajasthan . But , especially after the destruction of the Babri mosque , it alienated millions more - Muslims in particular but also members of lower castes , southerners and anyone who believed in the secular ideals of the first prime minister , Jawaharlal Nehru . Hindutva took the BJP only so far . 
 Since Ayodhya it has moved towards the political centre , attacking on safe issues like corruption and poor governance . It won the largest number of seats in last year 's general election but could govern only with the cooperation of more than a dozen other groupings that wanted no truck with its "" communal "" agenda . It wooed them by stifling its ideology . That coalition collapsed in April , but the sP has lost faith neither in consensus nor coalition . It is campaigning for re - election at the head of a 22 - party National Democratic Alliance ( NDA ) . Its own manifesto has been shelved in favour of a joint programme that promises a moratorium on "" contentious issues "" ( like building a Hindu temple where the Babri mosque once stood ) . 
 This Faustian decision permits the Bjp to shop , state by state , for alliances with parties that would otherwise split the vote against Congress , its main national rival . In West Bengal , for example , it has hooked up with Trinamul Congress , a breakaway from the Congress party that has substantial Muslim support . In Andhra Pradesh it has come to a seat - sharing arrangement with Mr Naidu 's Telegu Desam Party , a regional party whose main rival for power in the state is Congress . And so on across the map . In all , the BJP is expected to contest just 330 of the 543 seats in parliament , leaving the rest this time to fellow members of the NDA and other allies . Hail to the chief 
 This is India 's characteristic way of building maities from its natchwork of castes . language groups and states . The NDA has added to that a national gloss to attract floating voters and motivate committed ones . It has given the 22 - headed alliance a single face , that of Mr Maj payee . He portrays himself as a bulwark against ideologues in the Bjp and has long been more popular than his party . According to a recent poll in India Today , a weekly magazine , just it% of those who support him do so because of his party . All ten photographs in the NDA 'S election manifesto are of him . 
 That presidential tactic would not work half so well if Mr Vajpayee had not scored a last - minute presidential triumph . He spent much of his first year in power looking like a helpless school teacher trying to instil some discipline in an unruly classroom . That image was buried in July by India 's defeat of Pakistani invaders in Kashmir , India 's only Muslim - majority state . The BjP - led alliance has exploited this to the hilt , sometimes beyond what the election commission deems proper . It gives the alliance an issue around which it can rally floating voters . It makes raising the issue of Mrs Gandhi 's Italian origins seem less xenophobic . It helps the BJP rebrand itself as a party of inclusive nationalism rather than exclusive sectarianism . 
 Congress faithful must feel a bit like British Conservatives before their loss to "" New "" Labour in 1997 . "" New "" Be has stolen their secular ideology . Mr Vajpayee has acquired the charisma that once belonged to members of Mrs Gandhi 's dynasty : her martyred husband , Rajiv , his martyred mother , Indira , and Indira 's father , Jawaharlal Nehru . The opinion polls are unanimous in predicting a majority for Mr Vajpayee and the NDA . 
 Congress has helped them out with blunders and gaffes . The most damaging came in May , when three Congress leaders , including Sharad Pawar , head of the parliamentary party and its top gun in Maharashtra , said that no one born abroad ( like Mrs Gandhi ) should become prime minister . The party expelled them . They struck back by forming their own Nationalist Congress Party . That will hurt Congress in Maharashtra , which elected more Congress Mps than any other state last year . Pettier mistakes have followed . Mrs Gandhi tried to throw the media off her scent when she slipped away to the southern state of Karnataka to register her candidacy for one of the two parliamentary seats she is contesting . The Bjp got wind of her plans and sent down a high - profile female candidate to belittle Mrs Gandhi for her Italian birth , while Mr Vajpayee remained above the fray . Such misjudgments are commonly blamed not on Mrs Gandhi herself but on the "" courtiers "" who surround her . "" Sonia has some flair for judgment , "" says one Congressman , "" but it is blunted by limited access . "" 
 But hold on . Indian elections are not national referendums but summings - up of contests in some two dozen states ( plus various territories ) . Congress is a force in more of them than any other party . "" Do n't yet believe the opinion polls , "" says Ashutosh Varshney , a scholar at Columbia University in New York .

OF ALL the chief ministers of Indian states, none has more snap, crackle and pop than Chandrababu Naidu of Andhra Pradesh. Whether that will get his party reelected in the coming state election (taking place at the same time as India's general election, see following story) remains to be seen in a country where Kellogg's has failed to find consumer acceptance. Critics say he is just the sort of politician who is loved by foreign investors, lionised by the World Bank and rejected by the voters. 
Although he heads a regional party, the Telegu Desam Party, his vision is global, and he wants computers and globalisation to propel his state to prosperity. He aims to make Andhra Pradesh a world leader in computer software, and has succeeded in attracting several top companies, among them Microsoft. He proposes to link every village in the state by computer to pep up the administration and make it more open. He holds video conferences with his bureaucrats early every morning. 
Admirers say rural computerisation will improve the administration and enable villagers to get information, forms and documents without paying bribes to petty bureaucrats. But critics say it is silly to push for computerisation when rural electricity is scarce and erratic, and illiteracy is high. 
Despite almost a decade of liberalisation, chief ministers in India continue to believe that elections can be won by promising ever-bigger subsidies, jobs reserved for certain castes and other forms of patronage. Mr Naidu is a rare exception. If he is elected, that will show it is possible to stress productivity and decentralisation, rather than subsidies, and still win. What is at stake is not just Mr Naidu's future but a change in the prevailing political thinking among India's states. 
He faces several hurdles. He came to power through manipulation. His father-inlaw, N.T. Rama Rao, a film actor, won a landslide victory in 1994. Mr Naidu organised a party coup and took over. His father-in-law died soon after. Mr Naidu's manipulations did not gain him popularity; in the 1998 general election, his party and its allies won only of the state's 42 seats in the national Parliament. He has a lot of ground to make up. 
His attempt to reduce subsidies is being exploited cynically by his main opponent, the Congress party. Congress was the original liberaliser of 1991, and its finance minister, Manmohan Singh, repeatedly emphasised the need to abandon financial suicide in the form of free power for farmers. Mr Naidu has had the courage to do so. But the local Congress chief has called on farmers to stop paying their electricity dues, promising to waive them the moment he is elected. Manmohan Singh, now a potential prime minister, says blandly that he has no way of enforcing party discipline locally. 
Mr Naidu's plan to provide villages with computers is opposed by many bureaucrats, who fear that it will reduce their powers. Earlier this year they threatened an indefinite strike. Mr Naidu assured them that not a single government job would be cut by computerisation. But what was really at stake for the bureaucrats was not their jobs but their ability to extract bribes. Mr Naidu did not want to risk a paralysing strike in the approach to the election, and settled for a diluted version of computerisation. 
To add to his problems, his alliance with Atal Behari Vajpayee's ruling Bharatiya Janata Party is a double-edged weapon: it will gain him Hindu-nationalist votes but at the expense of the Muslim vote. Mr Naidu will be aware that voters in the state have thrown out every incumbent save one over the past 20 or more years. The state's corrupt bureaucracy has always failed to deliver whatever its chief minister has promised. A poll in Andhra Pradesh last year indicated that more than half the bureaucrats in most departments were thought to be corrupt. In one district, West Godavari, almost all were considered untrustworthy. 
A master manipulator who upended his father-in-law is bound to invite distrust. Critics say that Mr Naidu's rural schemes are simply a way of giving contracts to political cronies; that real rural power is being exercised by his party rather than villagers. However, much the same is said about the Marxist Party's decentralisation in West Bengal, and it has won five elections in a row there. 
Most opinion polls suggest a close fight. Much depends on whether Mr Naidu's computerisation and allied schemes have actually changed the lives of ordinary people. One Hyderabadi puts it this way: ""I entered into a real-estate deal last month. In the old days, I would have had to pay bribes totalling 2% of the land value, and make several visits to various offices. This time I still had to pay the 2%, but thejob was completed in one day."" 
Is that enough to get Mr Naidu elected? Possibly. People expect so little from politicians that one who delivers even a smidgen of what he promises has cause for hope. ","The state election to watch in India

 Austria 's far - right Freedom Party , whose leader , ] org Haider , has praised Hitler , came second in a general election , with 27 % of the vote , behind the Social Democrats with 33 % and a shade ahead of the conservative People 's Party . The ruling coalition of Social Democrats and the People 's Party seemed likely to break , but it was unclear whether the conservatives would let Mr Haider 's party join them in government . 
 Russian forces entered parts of Chechnya , taking about a third of the territory and sending troops to within 20 km of the capital , Grozny . The republic 's president , Aslan Maskhadov , called for a holy war . Some 120,000 refugees fled to Ingushetia , a neighbouring republic within Russia .

ELECTIONS, even when they are freely held and competitively contested, do not always produce the governments that the voters want, and the administration Atal Behari Vajpayee will now try to form in India may well come to disappoint the electorate that seems to have narrowly put his 24party coalition into office (see page 45). It has not been a landslide by any means, which suggests that no single message has been uppermost in the public mind. Even so, India's latest general election-a slow-motion affair that started on September 5th and ended only on Sunday-reveals something of the preferences of the voters, however unsatisfactory the choice of candidates that many of them faced. Indeed, though the campaign was mean-spirited and largely free of issues and ideology, it may be possible to divine the faint outlines of a modest mandate for the incoming government. 
The most prominent feature of this mandate is perhaps the desire for moderation. Mr Vajpayee is the standard-bearer of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), whose roots lie in the sometimes-sinister Hindu-nationalist movement. The BJP rose to national prominence in the early 1990s on a programme of Hindutva-Hinduness-and attracted zealots who wanted to tear down Muslim mosques and erect Hindu temples in their place, notably at Ayodhya in Uttar Pradesh. But, recognising that it could not form a government alone, the BJP fought this election as the leader of the 24-party National Democratic Alliance, whose manifesto promised a moratorium on ""contentious"" issues such as the building of a temple at Ayodhya. Though the BJP has not done as well as it had hoped to, its relative lack of success had nothing to do with any dilution of its Hindu message. 
Incidents of Hindu militancy continue-now directed more at Christians than at Muslims-but the campaign showed no general appetite for the uglier side of Hindu nationalism. It would be tragic if the BJP ignored that. Indeed, Mr Vajpayee's first duty now is to respect India's secular traditions and to ensure that no firebrands seek to strengthen the party's Hindu line and thus excite communal passions. 
Perhaps allied to the broadly tolerant mood in domestic affairs was a marked diminution during the campaign of the nationalist fervour whipped up a few months ago when Pakistani infiltrators succeeded in capturing some windswept mountain-tops in Kashmir. Pakistan's subsequent retreat certainly puffed out Indian chests; and, since the episode came little more than a year after Mr Vajpayee's previous government had cast aside years of restraint and openly conducted a series of nuclear tests, the BJP proudly trumpeted its claims to have made India a power to reckon with. At first, it seemed that the voters would be impressed. In the event, however, they appear to have been more concerned about blocked drains, pitted roads, absent schoolteachers, scarce jobs and predatory officials. 
If these and less local problems are to diminish, the next government must be given the time to tackle them, which its predecessors were not: the new government will be India's sixth in less than four years. The call to go to the polls-the country has had three general elections in the same period, as well as ballots in many states-is becoming a tediously and expensively frequent occurrence for Indians, many of whom are showing their disapproval, or lack of interest, by abstaining. They appear content with coalition government, but not with instability. In Tamil Nadu, certainly, the voters showed no gratitude to the party of Jayaram Jayalalitha, the former film star whose withdrawal of support for the previous government precipitated its collapse in April. 
Oh, for growth 
What the voters would like, no doubt, would be better living standards, and they should be able to have them. Both the BJP and Congress said in the campaign that they wanted to see India's economy expand by 7-8% a year, which would be an improvement on the current 5-6%, never mind the traditional 3%. Here then was a common commitment backed, wittingly or not, by a large majority of the voters. One piece of welcome news came from the state of Andhra Pradesh, where the proenterprise chief minister, Chandrababu Naidu, was reelected. He is one of the few leading politicians who understands the connection between efficiency and development.. 
Unfortunately, not everyone agrees about how to achieve growth, though the BJP, despite its traditional belief in self-- reliance (swadeshi), may be better disposed to opening up the economy than a communist-dependent Congress government would have been. If it does boost foreign investment, and at the same time manages to privatise, deregulate and generally cut red tape, this election may come to be judged more successful than anyone dared to hope. In any event, despite the lack of clear choices, the voters have shown their preferences. The politicians had better not let them down. ","A vote for moderation , stability and a better life

The BJP retains power, but its partners could be even more troublesome IT WAS a victory for the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and its allies, but less a vote of confidence. Most of the way through the counting of votes in India's third general election in little more than three years, it appeared that the slP-led National Democratic Alliance and a few companion parties outside the alliance would win around 295 of parliament's 543 elected seats, a workable majority. Yet the Bjp itself, with a smaller share of a larger coalition, will be even more dependent on its allies than before. The new government looks vulnerable to the instability and intracoalition blackmail that shortened the life of the last one. 
Behind the apparent continuity lies the churning of a restless, fragmented electorate that refuses to deliver a national verdict. There was no ""Vajpayee wave"": Atal Behari Vajpayee, who will remain prime minister, won his seat in Lucknow, the capital of Uttar Pradesh, with a smaller majority than he had last time. India's victory over Pakistani intruders in Kashmir this summer barely seemed to register, except perhaps in Delhi, the capital, which voted early and elected BJP candidates to all its seven constituencies. Voters did not seem to care that Sonia Gandhi, leader of the opposition Congress party, was born in Italy; she won in a southern constituency where the BJP tried to make that the only issue. 
No party, bar those on the left, offered voters a clear-cut ideology or philosophy of government. Instead, voters judged parties mainly on their performance at state level, and often found them wanting. Thus, despite its overall victory, the BjP suffered crushing losses in India's biggest state, Uttar Pradesh, which is ruled by a sjP-led coalition and accounted for nearly a third of the party's seats in the last parliament. In states where its allies were unpopular incumbents, for example in Punjab and in Karnataka, the National Democratic Alliance lost badly to Congress. It gained in states where Congress goofed. One such was in Maharashtra, where a rift between Congress and one of its top leaders split the vote against an unpopular coalition formed by the BJP and Shiv Sena, an ultra-nationalist party. 
The BJP did well where it was on the right side of popular opinion about the state government and shared the spoils with a strong ally. Thus, in Andhra Pradesh, it rode the coat-tails of the chief minister, Chandrababu Naidu, who has tried to make the state a showcase for investment-friendly reform. In Bihar, the second-largest and the poorest state, it appeared to profit from the misrule of populist Laloo Prasad Yadav. 
New stars have emerged (or re-emerged) from the tumult and some old ones have dimmed. The anti-Bjp wave in Uttar Pradesh has meant that parties aligned neither with the BJP nor Congress will have more seats than most analysts expected. The winners include Kumari Mayawati, an opportunistic leader of a party that represents mainly former untouchables but has apparently widened its base. Tamil Nadu's chief minister, M. Karunanidhi, a Dravidian nationalist who once opposed the northem-based, orthodox Hinduism that gave rise to the BJP, has become one of its most important allies. 
The election has humbled other movers and shakers such as Mr Yadav and Jayalalitha Jayaram, a Tamil former film star, whose defection brought down the last govemment. Akali Dal, the mainly Sikh party that dominated Punjab, has been all but wiped out at the national level. Manmohan Singh, who initiated India's economic reforms under the last Congress-led govemment, lost his bid for a Delhi seat to the BJP. Mr Vajpayee's authority over the next coalition will probably be enhanced by the BJP'S relative decline within it. He is the one BJP face acceptable to all its partners; Hindu-nationalist ideologues within his own party will have a harder time pressing their claims. 
But can the coalition work together, and can it last? Already there are signs of trouble. An ally from Haryana, whose party swept the state, is demanding that the new government roll back an increase in diesel prices, enacted just after the polls closed to contain a ballooning subsidy. BjP allies from Tamil Nadu and Karnataka were squabbling before the vote over the distribution of water from the Cauvery river. With Congress taking over the government in Karnataka, though, this may be a smaller problem for the coalition than it might have been. As the results rolled in, Ramakrishna Hegde, the Kamataka-based commerce minister, blamed ""total lack of co-ordination and co-operation"" between his party and the BJP for their poor showing in the state. 
Will it be better in government? The alliance says it will. Its members point out that they have had a year of practice. Miss Jayalalitha, the most troublesome member of the last coalition, is now an ally of Congress. Many others cannot afford to defect, because Congress is their main rival at state level. And the ""third force"" of nonaligned parties does not have enough seats to form an alternative government. Mr Vajpayee's prestige and fear of another election will hold the alliance together, its members say. Perhaps. But India's voters are in an unforgiving mood. They expect the parties in the new coalition not only to govern well at the centre but to improve their performance in the states that brought them to power. ","DELHI

WHEN Pervez Musharraf embarked on a homeward flight from Sri Lanka, he was chief of Pakistan's army. By the time he landed in Karachi, he was ruler of the country. The prime minister, Nawaz Sharif, had apparently sacked the general in mid-flight and ordered the plane diverted from Karachi (without enough fuel, General Musharraf later said). The army, which had got wind of the orders, countermanded them. Now it is Mr Sharif who has lost his job (and his freedom). For the first time in 22 years, Pakistan is under the direct control of its armed forces. Whether this marks a reprieve for South Asia's most mixed-up country or another lurch away from sanity it is still too soon to say. There are plenty of reasons for worry. 
This coup marks the first time in history that a military regime has taken over an avowed nuclear power. Like all Pakistani soldiers, General Musharraf has warlike instincts towards India, the country's giant, nuclear-armed neighbour. He oversaw a diplomatically disastrous invasion of Indian-controlled Kashmir this summer. With the army in power, at least behind the scenes, there is little hope of renewed dialogue soon with India's newly reelected prime minister, Atal Behari Vajpayee, and much fear in India that Pakistan will attack again. Pakistan's beaten-- up constitution has been molested yet again. General Musharraf has not yet said whether and when democracy will be restored (a statement is expected soon), but there is every reason to wonder whether another bout of rule by the army, even if through civilian proxies, will finally establish the rule of law in Pakistan. 
Pakistanis do not like military rule, yet there is more relief than despondency about the takeover. There were spontaneous celebrations at the ousting of Mr Sharif. The deposed prime minister had systematically undermined every institution capable of challenging, or even questioning, him, from the courts to the press to parliament. The economy, which slumped after punitive sanctions were imposed in response to Pakistan's nuclear tests in May 1998, remains on the verge of bankruptcy. 
After Mr Sharif retreated from his Kashmir misadventure, things got worse. Sectarian violence between Sunni and Shia Muslims reignited. Opposition, from religious parties and the smaller provinces, spilled into the streets, making Pakistanis wonder whether fundamentalism or separatism was the greater threat. The coup may not be legal, but there are hopes that it will make Pakistan more liberal. 
How liberal General Mushan af is by inclination is unclear. Reports about him are contradictory, some claiming that he is hostile to the West and close to the most religious elements in the army, others contending that he is a pro-western reformer. Nishat Ahmad, a retired general who seems to support the coup, calls him ""a little hot tempered and impetuous. I would have wished a man in his position to be more thoughtful."" 
It was the state of the army, more than the state of Pakistan, that seems to have triggered the takeover. It had been clashing with Mr Sharif ever since the pull-out from Kashmir, so much so that a month ago the United States publicly warned it not to stage a coup. Sources close to the armed forces say that it was only when Mr Sharif attempted to commandeer the army, as he had every other institution by putting his cronies in charge, that the soldiers drew the line. In his predawn speech on Pakistani television on October 13th, General Musharraf accused him of trying to ""politicise the army, destabilise it and create dissension within its ranks."" General Nishat says the coup ""came as a reaction, not as a planned coup to replace the government That story may be intended to deflect international wrath, but the generals' hesitation in disclosing their plans for a new government suggests it might be true. 
The wrath both emanating from and directed towards Pakistan will do much to shape its immediate future. The army's takeover is, among other things, a slap at the United States, which warned against it and, this summer, leaned on Pakistan to withdraw from Kashmir. Already a big sponsor of the Taliban government in Afghanistan, which the United States regards as a terrorist nursery, and of insurgencies in Indian Kashmir, Pakistan can make plenty more trouble if it wants to. The Indian army is on high alert. The rest of the world, on the other hand, can damage Pakistan, especially by way of its precarious economy. Pakistan is counting on a rescheduling of some $3 billion of debt to western governments and a $280m loan disbursement from the IMF, both of which are now in jeopardy. 
The Fund has to decide whether a loan-which might save ordinary Pakistanis from some further suffering-would be interpreted as approval of the coup. Under American law, a military takeover triggers an aid cut-off. Pakistan's economic isolation would raise the spectre that makes Pakistanis and westerners alike shudder: default, devaluation, inflation, revolution. Asad Durrani, a former general, says that leaders of the coup are ""thinking very hard about how to make it understood better"". That argues for restraint abroad and as little of the jackboot at home as possible. Though the mood in India is one of alarm, pundits take the view that the army will be ""far too busy grappling with internal dynamics"" to threaten India now. 
The Americans may be tempering their first hostile response; if General Musharraf gives military rule a civilian face, outside reaction may well be lenient. At home, General Musharraf has neither imposed martial law nor censored the press. But as The Economist went to press he had yet to say what he would do. Senior military officials say they want to revive faltering economic reforms, such as an overhaul of the tax system and policies to encourage more investment. 
Forward the technocrats? 
Most Pakistani observers expect him to appoint an interim government of civilian technocrats. They disagree about whether it would give way for new elections after the constitutionally mandated three months or whether it would govern long enough-say, two to three years-to restore health to Pakistan's finances, order to its streets and integrity to its administration. Najam Sethi, a prominent joumalist persecuted by the Sharif regime, wants him to do the latter. ""A nondemocratic government can create democratic conditions for decentralisation [and an] economic climate for revival,"" he says. 
But the delay suggests that General Musharraf may be under intense foreign pressure to observe constitutional propriety, perhaps by retaining a government based on the current parliament. Preserving that much of a discredited status quo could undermine reform, some fear. Fresh elections now might simply restore to power the same addicts of corruption and cronyism who have brought Pakistan to its current pass. 
The leader of the biggest opposition party, Benazir Bhutto, has had two disappointing terms in office and has been convicted of corruption. No one else has a national following. Most opposition leaders are not clamouring for early elections. If a govemment of civilian technocrats does good things, says Mr Sethi, ""the international community will come round"". But long-term rule by unelected technocrats also carries risks. Pakistan needs a dispersal of power and responsibility. Soldiers are centralisers by instinct. Technocrats are not immune to the temptations of office. Few unelected governments have ended in anything but disaster. General Musharraf will need to think deeply and act coolly if his political adventure is to end successfully. ","Once again it is the army's turn to govern South Asia's most wobbly state

Following the just-completed general election, The Economist co-sponsored a survey of the electorate by the Centre for the Study of Developing Societies in Delhi. The survey, of 9,069 people in 105 of the 543 parliamentary constituencies, suggests that the BJP's nationalistic campaign had little impact. Yet the party has won over groups that used to be wary of its pro-Hindu ideology 
THE world's largest democracy is also, to outsiders, the most perplexing. About 620m people are eligible to vote and well over half of them do, even though a series of unstable governments at the centre have compelled Indians to go to the polls three times in little more than three years. This vast electorate encompasses the world's largest concentrations of poverty and illiteracy. According to the CsDs survey, 29% of India's voters have no access to any sort of news media. 
And yet Indians are in some ways the world's most politically switched-on people. The official turnout figures (60% in the just-completed election, 62% in the one held just 19 months before) understate the case: if dead people and migrants were dropped from the electoral rolls, turnout would look much higher. The CSDS survey shows that half the voters were visited by a canvasserduring the campaign and that a remarkable 22% attended an election meeting. 
In a country where nearly a third of the people have not heard of the United States, a party like Janata Dal (United) can form up just weeks before the election, spring a new ballot symbol on the voters. and still capture 21% of the vote and a third of the seats in Bihar, the second-biggest state. Indians are capable of stunning feats of tactical voting, as in Uttar Pradesh, the biggest state. The opposition parties there were split, but managed nonetheless to chop the ruling party's strength in parliament by nearly half. 
Indians think their votes matter; 63% of the respondents in the survey said their votes have an effect on the way the country is run. Faith in democracy seems to be strongest where conventional wisdom would least expect it to be. Dalits (ex-untouchables) are more likely to vote than upper-caste Indians; urbanites are much less inclined than country folk. Indians use their votes to demolish barriers to the advancement of their caste or community, to secure protection and patronage and, very often, to punish. Democracy is India's way of prosecuting the struggles V.S. Naipaul wrote about in his 1992 book, ""India: A Million Mutinies Now"". 
The outcome of the 1999 general election, a drawn-out affair that began on September 5th and ended on October 3rd, does not look much like a mutiny. India will have the same prime minister, Atal Behari Vajpayee, as before. The outgoing coalition led by Mr Vajpayee's Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), now 24 parties strong and rechristened the National Democratic Alliance, was re-elected with an expanded majority. It is the first time that a pre-poll alliance has won a clear majority in parliament since 1984, and the first time a prime minister has won back-to-back terms since 1971. The election looked like a ringing endorsement of the status quo. 
Not quite.Just 281 of the 537 seats contested remained with the party that won the constituency in the election of 1998. Parties opposed to the BJP alliance took 88 of its seats away, and nearly half the alliance's seats came from its rivals. Although its majority rose, the share of the popular vote for its constituent parties dipped 1.5 percentage points. The mixed verdict sends several messages: the BJP's mandate is fuzzy and its victory depended on a large element of luck. The opposition Congress party, which got the lowest number of seats ever, is in slightly better electoral shape than the make-up of parliament suggests. The ""third force"" of parties aligned neither to Congress nor the BJP is not dead yet, though it will have little role to play in the current parliament. 
At the same time, the 1999 election marks the BJP's coming of age. What was in the 1980s a party of city-dwelling upper castes mainly in the Hindi-- speaking north has moved deep into new territory, social and geographic, most often through alliances but sometimes on its own. The BJP talks as if India were a single entity, but it understands that India's polity is a network of states in which castes, communities, classes and parties co-operate and compete for the benefits conferred by political power. The BJP wins because it surfs this web better than any other party. Yet, paradoxically, none is better placed to profit as globalisation and prosperity slowly homogenises the world's most diverse country. 
A hung jury 
It looked at first as if the 1999 election would break the pattern of the decade, in which national verdicts have been the sum of nearly independent verdicts in India's as states and seven territories. There were emotive national issues to vote on: India's victory in the ""Kargil war"", in which Indian troops valiantly drove Pakistani intruders off mountain peaks in the disputed state of Kashmir. There was, in Mr Vajpayee, a leader of national stature who had demonstrated, as Indians saw it, something like heroism by driving out the Pakistanis. To a polity drunk on patriotism his chief rival, Sonia Gandhi, president of the Congress party, could look like a villainess, an Italian-born widow cynically exploiting her connection to the Nehru-Gandhi family to achieve supreme political power in a country that is not her own. 
The CSDS survey shows that these themes did have some resonance. Nearly two-thirds (65%) knew of the skirmishes with Pakistan (compared with just 46% who knew about India's nuclear tests); but only 15% said the fighting had affected their vote. Mrs Gandhi's foreign origin offended roughly the same number of people. Mr Vajpayee was the most popular choice, though not an overwhelming one, for prime minister: 37% named him as their preference, compared with 27% for Mrs Gandhi. This election was indeed more ""presidential"" than recent ones. In 1996 47% did not name a preferred candidate; this year i6% demurred. 
Yet the 1999 election did not yield a national verdict akin to that of 1984, when Rajiv Gandhi, Mrs Gandhi's late husband, rode into office on a wave of sympathy after the assassination of his mother, Indira. There were landslides in this election, but they were bounded within states, and several went against the BJP and its allies. The BJP and the Telegu Desam Party, a regional ally, won a big majority of seats in Andhra Pradesh, yet with another ally it lost in neighbouring Karnataka. The BJP combine swept Haryana (in the north) but, in another configuration, collapsed in neighbouring Punjab. Mr Vajpayee triumphed in Bihar but was humiliated in Uttar Pradesh, the BJP's heartland. 
Divided loyalties 
In most states where they mattered, the BJP'S pet national issues seemed to be an excuse for people to vote as they were planning to anyway. In Haryana, 29% said Kargil had affected their vote; in next-door Punjab, slightly less than 15% did. The issue may have swung votes in a couple of states where Congress did less well than it had expected to: in Gujarat, where the slP has been governing without distinction, 25% said they were influenced by it. Overall, though, the 1999 election was, like others this decade, a split decision by a 32-member jury. 
Bombs and birth certificates would have availed the BJP little had it not exploited the two essentials of Indian politics: caste, the most decisive influence over the average voter, and the popularity (or lack of it) of state governments, which accounts for the biggest shifts. And the key to the chamber is alliances, in which like-minded parties back one another's candidates to avoid splitting the vote against a common rival. 
Half the respondents to our survey agreed with the statement: ""We should be loyal to our own region first and then to India."" Just zz% disagreed, a striking result in the wake of the fight with Pakistan. States are divided by language, except in the north, where several of India's most populous states share Hindi. That, along with varying social traditions and caste configurations, has given rise to a political system dominated by regional parties. Although Congress and the BJP are national in scope, 36 of the other 39 parties in parliament are confined mainly to one or two states. Most states have just a few important parties, often only two. Their elections usually produce clear mandates and governments that last their full five-year terms. It is the throng of states in the national parliament that produces India's political cacophony. 
The BJP, a growing party once confined to the north, has had an easier time accepting this than Congress, a shrinking national one. Voters apparently have some sympathy with Congress's claim that only single-party government can give India stable rule. In our survey, 22% of respondents saw ""nothing wrong"" with coalition government and 25% are against it in all circumstances. But the compulsions of state politics overwhelm convictions about what should happen at the centre. 
The BJP, which is more centre-minded than Congress, has no inhibitions about regional tie-ups. They have nothing to do with ideology (few of the 23 other parties in the National Democratic Alliance share the Hindu nationalism of the BJP). Nor have they much to do with overlapping interests among each party's constituency. In Bihar the BJP put together a winning coalition between upper castes and Dalits, who are at war with each other in some parts of the state. What matters most to the electoral success of an alliance is that it be on the right side of public opinion about the reigning state government. Thus the BJP and a regional party triumphed in Orissa against Congress, which leads an unpopular government. And the BJP's alliance in Karnataka bombed because its partner, the Janata Dal (United), was an unpopular incumbent. 
Within states, the main unit of electoral account is caste. It is impossible to generalise about how caste affects voting, because the effect varies from caste to caste, election to election, and state to state. Both of Andhra Pradesh's main parties seek to mobilise voters from all social strata, yet traditional voting patterns persist: 70% of Reddys (a prosperous land-owning caste) voted for Congress, despite the landslide against; 90% of Kammas, a rival group of similar status, backed the Telegu Desam Party of the chief minister, Chandrababu Naidu, himself a Kamma. In other cases a sudden change of caste preference can help swing an election. In Rajasthan 70% of Jats, a small but influential group, contributed to Congress's victory in state elections late last year. After a squabble broke out with the new state government over job reservations for the group, 65% of the Jats voted this time for the BJP, which won the state by a narrow margin. 
To many people there is something sinister or quaint about accidents of birth fixing political behaviour. Yet caste has ceased in most of India to be a hierarchy based on notions of ritual pollution and has become instead a vehicle for disadvantaged groups to press economic and social demands. 
These can be as basic as protection (the rise of a party representing mainly Dalits curtailed violence against them in Uttar Pradesh, the biggest state) or as ambitious as reservations in government jobs, which were introduced in this decade in many states for lower castes (other than Dalits, which already had them). To be lower caste is an advantage in the public sector, which most Indians still regard as the surest path to the middle class. Caste politics do not fracture state boundaries. Caste-based parties rarely matter much beyond one state, even when the caste they represent does. 
The BJP's strategy in Bihar, the second largest state, is a textbook example of how to braid caste, anti-incumbency and alliances into victory. The BJP and its 1998 ally, the Samata party, began with an edge: 30 of the state's seats in parliament against 23 for Latool Prasad Yadav, the state's populist leader, who had an alliance with Congress. This year the Samata party, mainly representing other backward castes (OBCS), melded into the Janata Dal (United) and added a new face, Ram Vilas Paswan, a popular Dalit politician. He transformed the alliance's profile. Support among Dalits more than doubled from li% last year to 33% in 1999, according to the CSDS survey. Its share of lower osc voters jumped from 31% to 41%. The alliance rose to 40 seats. But Laloo's poor record did him no harm among his core supporters: his vote among Yadavs rose from 53% to 63% and among Muslims from 66% to 68%. 
The new catch-all party? 
The BJP may have won a less than overwhelming mandate, but it can claim to have won trust. Less than ten years ago it was almost a pariah party for its role in stirring up tensions between Hindus and Muslims, especially after the 1992 destruction of the Babri mosque in Ayodhya in Uttar Pradesh. Now few parties outside Congress and the communist parties will not consider it as an ally. Though it continues to depend more than others on the support of India's dominant northern males, it is attracting more lower castes, more country folk, more women, more southerners and (surprisingly enough) more Muslims than ever before. 
Its expansion does not always mean shrouding its ideology, or deferring to allies. The BJP became the dominant party in Gujarat by joining, and then devouring, a vulnerable ally. It some day could do the same in Orissa, where the local partner has neither a strong ideology of its own nor a good organisation. The BJP's pro-Hindu bias can still be electorally useful, for example in Assam, which is anxious about an influx of Bangladeshi (Muslim) migrants. 
In the longer term, the BJP is likely to prosper as more Indians come to resemble the well-off urbanites that are its most reliable supporters. According to csos data, for example, Dalits with more than ten years of education are more likely to vote for the BjP alliance than for any other grouping. 
Congress seems to be heading in the opposite direction. Once a catch-all party that embraced the top and bottom of the social pyramid, it no longer knows who its natural supporters are. In states where its main opponent is the BJP itself, it is largely a lower-- caste party. Where its main opposition is a regional party, its profile is mainly upper caste. Its vote base seems to be whatever the opposition leaves over. Yogendra Yadav of the CSDS compares Congress to a pillow, which retains the impression of whoever last sat on it. 
There were glimmers of hope for Congress in this election (such as a 2.7 point rise in its share of the popular vote, most of it in Uttar Pradesh) and shades of doubt for the BJP. Still, it is hard to shake the impression that history is on the side of Mr Vajpayee and his thoroughly pragmatic crusaders. ","DELHI

Democracy is India 's way of prosecuting the struggles V.S. Naipaul wrote about in his 1992 book , "" India : A Million Mutinies Now "" . 
 The outcome of the 1999 general election , a drawn - out affair that began on September 5th and ended on October 3rd , does not look much like a mutiny . India will have Atal Bihari Vajpayee , as before . The outgoing coalition led by Atal Bihari Vajpayee's Bharatiya Janata Party ( BJP ) , now 24 parties strong and rechristened the National Democratic Alliance , was re - elected with an expanded majority . It is the first time that a pre - poll alliance has won a clear majority in parliament since 1984 , and the first time a prime minister has won back - to - back terms since 1971 . The election looked like a ringing endorsement of the status quo . 
 Not quite . Just 281 of the 537 seats contested remained with the party that won the constituency in the election of 1998 . Parties opposed to the BJP alliance took 88 of its seats away , and nearly half the alliance 's seats came from its rivals . Although its majority rose , the share of the popular vote for its constituent parties dipped 1.5 percentage points . The mixed verdict sends several messages : the BJP 's mandate is fuzzy and its victory depended on a large element of luck . The opposition Congress party , which got the lowest number of seats ever , is in slightly better electoral shape than the make - up of parliament suggests . The "" third force "" of parties aligned neither to Congress nor the BJP is not dead yet , though it will have little role to play in the current parliament . 
 At the same time , the 1999 election marks the BJP 's coming of age . What was in the 1980s a party of city - dwelling upper castes mainly in the Hindi-- speaking north has moved deep into new territory , social and geographic , most often through alliances but sometimes on its own . The BJP talks as if India were a single entity , but it understands that India 's polity is a network of states in which castes , communities , classes and parties co - operate and compete for the benefits conferred by political power . The BJP wins because it surfs this web better than any other party . Yet , paradoxically , none is better placed to profit as globalisation and prosperity slowly homogenises the world 's most diverse country . 
 A hung jury 
 It looked at first as if the 1999 election would break the pattern of the decade , in which national verdicts have been the sum of nearly independent verdicts in India 's as states and seven territories . There were emotive national issues to vote on : India 's victory in the "" Kargil war "" , in which Indian troops valiantly drove Pakistani intruders off mountain peaks in the disputed state of Kashmir . There was , in Mr Vajpayee , a leader of national stature who had demonstrated , as Indians saw it , something like heroism by driving out the Pakistanis . To a polity drunk on patriotism his chief rival , Sonia Gandhi , president of the Congress party , could look like a villainess , an Italian - born widow cynically exploiting her connection to the Nehru - Gandhi family to achieve supreme political power in a country that is not her own . 
 The CSDS survey shows that these themes did have some resonance . Nearly two - thirds ( 65 % ) knew of the skirmishes with Pakistan ( compared with just 46 % who knew about India 's nuclear tests ) ; but only 15 % said the fighting had affected their vote . Mrs Gandhi 's foreign origin offended roughly the same number of people . Atal Bihari Vajpayee was the most popular choice , though not an overwhelming one , for prime minister : 37 % named Atal Bihari Vajpayee as their preference , compared with 27 % for Mrs Gandhi . This election was indeed more "" presidential "" than recent ones . In 1996 47 % did not name a preferred candidate ; this year i6 % demurred . 
 Yet the 1999 election did not yield a national verdict akin to that of 1984 , when Rajiv Gandhi , Mrs Gandhi 's late husband , rode into office on a wave of sympathy after the assassination of his mother , Indira . There were landslides in this election , but they were bounded within states , and several went against the BJP and its allies . The BJP and the Telegu Desam Party , a regional ally , won a big majority of seats in Andhra Pradesh , yet with another ally it lost in neighbouring Karnataka . The BJP combine swept Haryana ( in the north ) but , in another configuration , collapsed in neighbouring Punjab . Atal Bihari Vajpayee triumphed in Bihar but was humiliated in Uttar Pradesh , the BJP 's heartland . 
 Divided loyalties 
 In most states where they mattered , the BJP 'S pet national issues seemed to be an excuse for people to vote as they were planning to anyway . In Haryana , 29 % said Kargil had affected their vote ; in next - door Punjab , slightly less than 15 % did . The issue may have swung votes in a couple of states where Congress did less well than it had expected to : in Gujarat , where the slP has been governing without distinction , 25 % said they were influenced by it . Overall , though , the 1999 election was , like others this decade , a split decision by a 32 - member jury . 
 Bombs and birth certificates would have availed the BJP little had it not exploited the two essentials of Indian politics : caste , the most decisive influence over the average voter , and the popularity ( or lack of it ) of state governments , which accounts for the biggest shifts . And the key to the chamber is alliances , in which like - minded parties back one another 's candidates to avoid splitting the vote against a common rival . 
 Half the respondents to our survey agreed with the statement : "" We should be loyal to our own region first and then to India . "" Just zz% disagreed , a striking result in the wake of the fight with Pakistan . States are divided by language , except in the north , where several of India 's most populous states share Hindi . That , along with varying social traditions and caste configurations , has given rise to a political system dominated by regional parties . Although Congress and the BJP are national in scope , 36 of the other 39 parties in parliament are confined mainly to one or two states . Most states have just a few important parties , often only two . Their elections usually produce clear mandates and governments that last their full five - year terms . It is the throng of states in the national parliament that produces India 's political cacophony . 
 The BJP , a growing party once confined to the north , has had an easier time accepting this than Congress , a shrinking national one . Voters apparently have some sympathy with Congress 's claim that only single - party government can give India stable rule . In our survey , 22 % of respondents saw "" nothing wrong "" with coalition government and 25 % are against it in all circumstances . But the compulsions of state politics overwhelm convictions about what should happen at the centre . 
 The BJP , which is more centre - minded than Congress , has no inhibitions about regional tie - ups . They have nothing to do with ideology ( few of the 23 other parties in the National Democratic Alliance share the Hindu nationalism of the BJP ) . Nor have they much to do with overlapping interests among each party 's constituency . In Bihar the BJP put together a winning coalition between upper castes and Dalits , who are at war with each other in some parts of the state . What matters most to the electoral success of an alliance is that it be on the right side of public opinion about the reigning state government . Thus the BJP and a regional party triumphed in Orissa against Congress , which leads an unpopular government . And the BJP 's alliance in Karnataka bombed because its partner , the Janata Dal ( United ) , was an unpopular incumbent . 
 Within states , the main unit of electoral account is caste . It is impossible to generalise about how caste affects voting , because the effect varies from caste to caste , election to election , and state to state . Both of Andhra Pradesh 's main parties seek to mobilise voters from all social strata , yet traditional voting patterns persist : 70 % of Reddys ( a prosperous land - owning caste ) voted for Congress , despite the landslide against ; 90 % of Kammas , a rival group of similar status , backed the Telegu Desam Party of the chief minister , Chandrababu Naidu , himself a Kamma . In other cases a sudden change of caste preference can help swing an election . In Rajasthan 70 % of Jats , a small but influential group , contributed to Congress 's victory in state elections late last year . After a squabble broke out with the new state government over job reservations for the group , 65 % of the Jats voted this time for the BJP , which won the state by a narrow margin . 
 To many people there is something sinister or quaint about accidents of birth fixing political behaviour . Yet caste has ceased in most of India to be a hierarchy based on notions of ritual pollution and has become instead a vehicle for disadvantaged groups to press economic and social demands . 
 These can be as basic as protection ( the rise of a party representing mainly Dalits curtailed violence against them in Uttar Pradesh , the biggest state ) or as ambitious as reservations in government jobs , which were introduced in this decade in many states for lower castes ( other than Dalits , which already had them ) . To be lower caste is an advantage in the public sector , which most Indians still regard as the surest path to the middle class . Caste politics do not fracture state boundaries . Caste - based parties rarely matter much beyond one state , even when the caste they represent does . 
 The BJP 's strategy in Bihar , the second largest state , is a textbook example of how to braid caste , anti - incumbency and alliances into victory . The BJP and its 1998 ally , the Samata party , began with an edge : 30 of the state 's seats in parliament against 23 for Latool Prasad Yadav , the state 's populist leader , who had an alliance with Congress . This year the Samata party , mainly representing other backward castes ( OBCS ) , melded into the Janata Dal ( United ) and added a new face , Ram Vilas Paswan , a popular Dalit politician . He transformed the alliance 's profile . Support among Dalits more than doubled from li% last year to 33 % in 1999 , according to the CSDS survey . Its share of lower osc voters jumped from 31 % to 41 % . The alliance rose to 40 seats . But Laloo 's poor record did him no harm among his core supporters : his vote among Yadavs rose from 53 % to 63 % and among Muslims from 66 % to 68 % . 
 The new catch - all party ? 
 The BJP may have won a less than overwhelming mandate , but it can claim to have won trust . Less than ten years ago it was almost a pariah party for its role in stirring up tensions between Hindus and Muslims , especially after the 1992 destruction of the Babri mosque in Ayodhya in Uttar Pradesh . Now few parties outside Congress and the communist parties will not consider it as an ally . Though it continues to depend more than others on the support of India 's dominant northern males , it is attracting more lower castes , more country folk , more women , more southerners and ( surprisingly enough ) more Muslims than ever before . 
 Its expansion does not always mean shrouding its ideology , or deferring to allies . The BJP became the dominant party in Gujarat by joining , and then devouring , a vulnerable ally . It some day could do the same in Orissa , where the local partner has neither a strong ideology of its own nor a good organisation . The BJP 's pro - Hindu bias can still be electorally useful , for example in Assam , which is anxious about an influx of Bangladeshi ( Muslim ) migrants . 
 In the longer term , the BJP is likely to prosper as more Indians come to resemble the well - off urbanites that are its most reliable supporters . According to csos data , for example , Dalits with more than ten years of education are more likely to vote for the BjP alliance than for any other grouping . 
 Congress seems to be heading in the opposite direction . Once a catch - all party that embraced the top and bottom of the social pyramid , it no longer knows who its natural supporters are . In states where its main opponent is the BJP itself , it is largely a lower-- caste party . Where its main opposition is a regional party , its profile is mainly upper caste . Its vote base seems to be whatever the opposition leaves over . Yogendra Yadav of the CSDS compares Congress to a pillow , which retains the impression of whoever last sat on it . 
 There were glimmers of hope for Congress in this election ( such as a 2.7 point rise in its share of the popular vote , most of it in Uttar Pradesh ) and shades of doubt for the BJP . Still , it is hard to shake the impression that history is on the side of Atal Bihari Vajpayee and Atal Bihari Vajpayee's thoroughly pragmatic crusaders .",750,India,A29-8257,IN TERM,True,"the same prime minister , Atal Behari Vajpayee",7,True

BASKING in the luxury of a comfortable majority, India's re-elected prime minister, Atal Behari Vajpayee, got down tobusiness.

Mr Vajpayee and Mr Singh will be preoccupied with the return of military rule to Pakistan (see page 39). Despite his improved budget, Mr Sinha has a ballooning fiscal deficit to worry about.

The government has promised a ""second generation"" of economic reforms, which are expected to include reform of the labour laws, more privatisation and reductions in subsidies. 
Early signs are that the Be will have an easier time managing its sprawling coalition than it did before. No single party is in a position to bring the government down.

Hinduism can coexist with Catholicism. Hindu nationalists may not want to 
WHEN Pope John Paul arrives in Delhi Won November 5th for his second visit to India, the country plans to be on its best behaviour. The recently re-elected government, led by the Hindu-nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party (Bjp), promises him ""all courtesies and honours""due a head of state. It has muted protests by Hindu groups that object to Christian proselytising. Jawaharlal Nehru Stadium in Delhi, where the pope is to say mass before some 50,000 people, is to be fitted out with a cross-shaped podium decorated with a painted diya, the earthenware lamp used at Diwali, a Hindu festival that coincides with the visit. 
The fusion of Christian spirit and Indian symbol is meant to be a friendly tribute, yet not all Indians will take it that way. Some think the Roman Catholic church and other Christian denominations are bent on subverting Indian culture through making conversions. And many of those have links to the BJP. The pope's first visit in 1986 was a festive, ten-day jaunt that took him across much of India. This one, a two-day stop in Delhi to put the papal imprimatur on the conclusions of a synod of Asian bishops, takes place ""against a backdrop of hate,"" says John Dayal, national secretary of the All India Catholic Union. 
Hatred was evident in 1998 and early 1999, when Hindu gangs attacked Christian churches and congregations in the western state of Gujarat. An Australian missionary, Graham Staines, and his two sons were burnt to death in their car in the eastern state of Orissa. Sporadic attacks continue. In September, a Catholic priest was killed in Orissa by unidentified assailants. 
The pope's visit has stirred Hindu activists who equate Christianity with conversion, which they regard as a latter-day form of colonialism. Conversions ""aimed at enslaving the country once again will destroy our culture and resources,"" says a leader of the National Cultural Forum, which has sent a protest caravan from Goa to Delhi. Protesters say they do not oppose the pope's visit but want him to apologise for forced conversions and other ""crimes"" committed by the Catholic church against the Indian people. Nowhere does Christianity appear to them more threatening than in the north-east, where several states have Christian majorities and Christians have figured among those taking part in the region's many insurgencies and secessionist movements. 
Much of this anxiety seems misplaced. The Christian share of the population had declined to 2.30/. in 1991, according to the census that year, from 2.4% recorded ten years earlier (Hindu and some Christian groups say ""hidden Christians"" make the real number much higher). There is little hard information to back up the accusations and denials about what has happened since. Clearly, many Christian groups would like to win Indian souls, but some go about it offensively by denigrating indigenous religions. Much proselytising is said to result in ""sheep stealing"", luring Christians from one denomination to another. 
Missionaries have had some success in tribal areas, for example in the area of Gujarat affected by anti-Christian violence earlier this year, but they are starting from a low base;in 1991 less than 0.596 of the state's population was Christian. In the north-east, Christianity may feed the sense of alienation among some groups from the dominant culture. But not everyone accepts the idea that Christianity has bred separatism. 
The BJP, with over 20 partners in its coalition and India's image abroad to think about, has to distance itself from the activism of anti-Christian groups, even though some are fellow members of the Hindu-- nationalist umbrella organisation, the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh. The police have arrested five members of a party allied to the BJP to prevent trouble during the pope's visit. 
Yet the BjP has not rejected an ideology that sees conversion, if not Christianity itself, as a threat. Even the prime minister, Atal Behari Vajpayee, suggested he shared it earlier this year when he called for a national debate on conversions. Arun Shourie, a BjP member of the upper house, accuses missionaries of deceit in their insatiable quest for converts. The visit of a pope ""comes and goes"", says Mr Shourie. The struggle against conversion, he makes clear, will go on. ","India and the pope

Economic reform is moving ahead, but slowly 
AS A medium-sized manufacturer of steam engineering products, Forbes Marshall has prospered since India's economy opened up in the early 1990s. Sales have jumped ten-fold in ten years and profits even more, says Naushad Forbes, a director of the family owned company. interaction with the government has changed dramatically, he says. But not enough has changed. Forbes Marshall's wares run a gamut of inspectors, and as a result it takes three days to dispatch goods from the factory in Pune until they are shipped from Mumbai (Bombay), just 175 kilometres (110 miles) away. A competitor in Singapore can have his product on an aeroplane in two hours. 
Power failures interrupt production for one to two hours a week, longer during monsoons. India's constricting labour laws have pushed the company, along with many others, to invest more in machinery than seems natural in a labour-rich country. That begins to tell you why India needs to start a second generation of reforms and to complete the first. The newly re-elected government, led by the Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), has promised to do that, laying out 42 measures, by one count, in the president's speech to Parliament on the government's legislation proposals. it wants to lift economic growth to 7-8% and foreign direct investment from about $3 billion to $10 billion a year. The key, the government seems to recognise, is to fashion for India a less intrusive but more effective state. 
Its first real chance to try began this week, with the opening of the winter session of Parliament on November 29th. With the economy growing at a healthy rate of about 6% and a comfortable majority for the ruling coalition, prospects for reform are brighter than they have been in years. The government wants to begin with a bang, by enacting a raft of bills that were stalled first by dissent and then by the fall of the government in April. The most keenly watched of these will be a measure to open up insurance to private investment and allow foreigners to take minority stakes in insurers. 
Yet delivering the next generation of reform will be harder than giving birth to the first. Rakesh Mohan, director of the National Council of Applied Economic Research in Delhi, describes the early measures, including delicensing of industry and tariff cutting, as ""reforms by announcement"", which could be enacted virtually overnight. What lies ahead are ""process"" reforms, which require ""persuasion, administrative reforms, and changes of mindset of all the main actors in the economic process"". The actors that need to reform themselves include central and state governments as well as the enterprises they own. 
The combined central and state deficits are likely to reach a staggering 9% Of GDP this fiscal year (which ends on March 31st). This has been bearable so far, because the economy has been growing fast enough to generate funds to service the debt. Even with a big pool of domestic savings, though, real interest rates are high enough to discourage private investment. ""Continued high fiscal deficits will raise the government's own debt-servicing burden, and move the country toward an internal debt trap,"" says a recent report by Standard & Poor's, a creditrating agency. 
The borrowed money is largely squandered. The central and state governments embraced a commission's advice to lift bureaucrats' pay, but ignored its call to trim the bureaucracy. States give away services such as electric power to farmers and others or, worse, help people steal it. As a result, they have no money to invest in infrastructure, and the private sector has little incentive to do so. Untargeted subsidies run to about 10% Of GDP. After salaries, subsidies and interest on the mounting debt, little is left over for health and education. Spending by states on such social services has dropped from 5.6% of GDP in 1990-91 to 5.3%. 
The government now recognises that it has been doing many of the wrong things and few of the right ones. ""On the ingredients and content of reform there is a total convergence of view,"" says N.K. Singh, who oversees reform from the prime minister's office. This overstates the consensus. The finance minister, Yashwant Sinha, has suggested liberalising labour laws, which discourage hiring by prohibiting firing, but this found no direct mention in the government's proposals to Parliament. Nor did privatisation of indfficient puvlicly owned bank, which are a drag on enterprise and could become a drain on the exchequer. States, which alone can undertake vital reforms, such as charging sensible prices for electricity, are joining hte consensus under pressure of penury, but rather slowly. 
The opposition Congress party is on board in theory, but may for narrow political reasons shoot down parts of the government's legislative programme in the upper house, whter the government is in a minority. The ""real challenges"" will lie in implementation, says Mr Singh. But this is a loose enough term to hide dissent. Ministers may agree in princi;le to privatise industrial firms; in practice they are loath to see their empires auctioned off. The government is nowhere near reaching its target of raising 100 billion rupees ($2.3 billion) from disinvestment in the current fiscal year (partly, it is true, because of the election). 
Most members of the Disinvestment Commission, which advises the government on privatisation, resigned because their recommendations were being ignored. 
If ministers cannot be tamed, still harder is thejob of disciplining the sort of bureaucrats encountered by Marshall Forbes and every other enterprise in the land. Sloppiness is not stasis, however. Reform will move ahead at different speeds on different fronts. This month the finance ministry announced a deal with states to harmonise sales taxes and introduce a value-added tax in 2ooi. Competition in local telephony should take off now that a dispute over licence fees has been resolved: ruinously for some service industries, though competition in international calling is years away. 
Some reforms, such as giving automatic approval to most types of foreign investment, can still be done by announcement. Mr Singh says that the prime minister, Atal Behari Vajpayee, is establishing ""milestones"" for reform and has asked for monthly status reports on them. The true scope of the reform programme may not be clear until the government presents its budget early next year. Reform will not stop. The risk is that it will not match the rhetoric of the government or lift growth to levels needed to reduce poverty rapidly. Businessmen like Mr Forbes are prospering despite the constraints, and entrepreneurs in fast-growing sectors such as software barely seem to notice what is going on in Delhi. India is likely to remain a cross between the tiger and the dodo. It is for Mr Vaj payee, and those entrepreneurs, to decide how quickly India sheds its feathers and acquires stripes. ","DELHI

With the economy growing at a healthy rate of about 6% and a comfortable majority for the ruling coalition, prospects for reform are brighter than they have been in years. The government wants to begin with a bang, by enacting a raft of bills that were stalled first by dissent and then by the fall of the government in April. The most keenly watched of these will be a measure to open up insurance to private investment and allow foreigners to take minority stakes in insurers. 
Yet delivering the next generation of reform will be harder than giving birth to the first. Rakesh Mohan, director of the National Council of Applied Economic Research in Delhi, describes the early measures, including delicensing of industry and tariff cutting, as ""reforms by announcement"", which could be enacted virtually overnight. What lies ahead are ""process"" reforms, which require ""persuasion, administrative reforms, and changes of mindset of all the main actors in the economic process"". The actors that need to reform themselves include central and state governments as well as the enterprises they own. 
The combined central and state deficits are likely to reach a staggering 9% Of GDP this fiscal year (which ends on March 31st). This has been bearable so far, because the economy has been growing fast enough to generate funds to service the debt. Even with a big pool of domestic savings, though, real interest rates are high enough to discourage private investment. ""Continued high fiscal deficits will raise the government's own debt-servicing burden, and move the country toward an internal debt trap,"" says a recent report by Standard & Poor's, a creditrating agency. 
The borrowed money is largely squandered. The central and state governments embraced a commission's advice to lift bureaucrats' pay, but ignored its call to trim the bureaucracy. States give away services such as electric power to farmers and others or, worse, help people steal it. As a result, they have no money to invest in infrastructure, and the private sector has little incentive to do so. Untargeted subsidies run to about 10% Of GDP. After salaries, subsidies and interest on the mounting debt, little is left over for health and education. Spending by states on such social services has dropped from 5.6% of GDP in 1990-91 to 5.3%. 
The government now recognises that it has been doing many of the wrong things and few of the right ones. ""On the ingredients and content of reform there is a total convergence of view,"" says N.K. Singh, who oversees reform from the prime minister's office. This overstates the consensus. The finance minister, Yashwant Sinha, has suggested liberalising labour laws, which discourage hiring by prohibiting firing, but this found no direct mention in the government's proposals to Parliament. Nor did privatisation of indfficient puvlicly owned bank, which are a drag on enterprise and could become a drain on the exchequer. States, which alone can undertake vital reforms, such as charging sensible prices for electricity, are joining hte consensus under pressure of penury, but rather slowly. 
The opposition Congress party is on board in theory, but may for narrow political reasons shoot down parts of the government's legislative programme in the upper house, whter the government is in a minority. The ""real challenges"" will lie in implementation, says Mr Singh. But this is a loose enough term to hide dissent. Ministers may agree in princi;le to privatise industrial firms; in practice they are loath to see their empires auctioned off. The government is nowhere near reaching its target of raising 100 billion rupees ($2.3 billion) from disinvestment in the current fiscal year (partly, it is true, because of the election). 
Most members of the Disinvestment Commission, which advises the government on privatisation, resigned because their recommendations were being ignored. 
If ministers cannot be tamed, still harder is thejob of disciplining the sort of bureaucrats encountered by Marshall Forbes and every other enterprise in the land. Sloppiness is not stasis, however. Reform will move ahead at different speeds on different fronts. This month the finance ministry announced a deal with states to harmonise sales taxes and introduce a value-added tax in 2ooi. Competition in local telephony should take off now that a dispute over licence fees has been resolved: ruinously for some service industries, though competition in international calling is years away. 
Some reforms, such as giving automatic approval to most types of foreign investment, can still be done by announcement. Mr Singh says that the prime minister, Atal Behari Vajpayee, is establishing ""milestones"" for reform and has asked for monthly status reports on them. The true scope of the reform programme may not be clear until the government presents its budget early next year. Reform will not stop. The risk is that it will not match the rhetoric of the government or lift growth to levels needed to reduce poverty rapidly. Businessmen like Mr Forbes are prospering despite the constraints, and entrepreneurs in fast-growing sectors such as software barely seem to notice what is going on in Delhi. India is likely to remain a cross between the tiger and the dodo. It is for Mr Vaj payee, and those entrepreneurs, to decide how quickly India sheds its feathers and acquires stripes.

THERE was a moment, during the weeklong hijacking of an Indian Airlines flight that began on December 24th, when it looked as if victory might be salvaged from tragedy. The hijackers had murdered one of about igo passengers and crew who were on the flight from Katmandu to Delhi. in Kandahar, where the aircraft finally landed, Afghanistan's radical Islamist government was co-operating with India and threatening to storm the aircraft if more hostages were hurt. There were hopes that the hostages would be freed, that the hijackers would be denied a prize and that Afghanistan's Taliban regime, treated as an international pariah, would begin its journey to respectability. 
But in the end the hijackers got what they wanted. India freed three militants,jailed for fighting Indian rule in Kashmir, in exchange for the 155 remaining hostages (some two dozen were let off at an earlier stop in Dubai). An American official describes the outcome so far as a victory for the terrorists, who ""if they are not captured will have gotten away with murder, literally"". Afghanistan's quest for an end to its isolation made little headway, and India blamed Pakistan for sponsoring and directing the hijacking. Relations between South Asia's two nuclear powers, already soured after a brief war in Kashmir last summer, and a military coup in Pakistan in October, are now even worse. 
In India there is popular relief that the hijacking ended without a bloodbath but also considerable outrage at the government's handling of the crisis. The prime minister, Atal Behari Vajpayee, who recently began a second term in office by vowing he would not tolerate terrorism, ended up sending his foreign minister to Kandahar to deliver personally the freed militants and retrieve the hostages, an act of shuttle diplomacy that one commentator called ""grovelling"". The freed militants include Maulana Masood Azhar, a leading light of Harkat ul-Mujahideen, a group based in Pakistan that operates in Kashmir. The group has twice before kidnapped westerners, demanding the imprisoned leader as their ransom. 
India's crisis managers, from the prime minister down, are being blamed for responding ineptly, especially in allowing the aircraft to take off from Amritsar in Punjab, where it stopped briefly to refuel. Some precedents; may have encouraged the hijackers, such as the 1989 kidnapping of an Indian minister's daughter, who was exchanged for several Kashmiri separatists. No one says India should have sacrificed 155 innocents to blind principle, but there is a widespread feeling that it could have protected them both with greater vigilance against terrorism and with a more decisive response when it happened. India insists it got the best deal possible in the circumstances. 
Anti-Indian militants, who had already stepped up their campaign in Kashmir in the wake of last summer's border battle with Pakistan, may now be further emboldened. on January 3rd a bomb exploded in a market in Srinagar, Kashmir's summer capital, killing at least 17 people. 
Just how the hijacking fits into the tangled drama that pits Islamic zealots, some of whom find shelter in Afghanistan, against foes as diverse as India, the United States and Russia is uncertain. India regards it as a Pakistani plot. Pakistan has long supported militancy in Indian-controlled Kashmir, which it believes ought tobe part of Pakistan, and in other parts of India. it is also the leading foreign patron of the Taliban government. Mr Vajpayee says he will disclose evidence of Pakistan's involvement in the hijacking ""at an appropriate time"". He renewed India's call, mainly to the United States, to blacklist Pakistan as a terrorist state. Pakistan's ruler, General Pervez Musharraf, told Mr Vajpayee to ""play cool"" and said Pakistan had performed a ""very positive role"". 
The United States is reluctant to brand Pakistan. For one thing, it is an erstwhile ally; its military-led government continues to look like a bulwark against the Islamic extremists it sometimes succours. The Americans regard India's case against Pakistan as unproven. Mr Azhar has apparently surfaced in Karachi in Pakistan. Another of the released militants has been reported in Muzaffarabad, capital of the part of Kashmir that is controlled by Pakistan. India says that the hijackers have crossed from Afghanistan into Pakistan, but there is no confirmation of this. America acknowledges that Pakistan bears at least some indirect responsibility for the hijacking by providing ""moral support"" and other kinds of help to groups such as Harkat ul-Mujahideen. it insists that Pakistan arrest the hijackers if it can, as it is obliged to do under a 1970 convention. Pakistan says it will, but few people believe it. 
Afghanistan's role is also murky. The Taliban initially won Indian and international goodwill by taking steps to protect the wellbeing of the hostages.They then lost much of it by being equally protective of the terrorists. They did not press for an unconditional surrender and, after the deal, they allowed the hijackers to flee. 
The more the three governments in the region disclaim responsibility for the hijacking the more they share it. Pakistan and Afghanistan harbour groups that commit such acts. India has mismanaged the terrorist threat and, more damagingly, has failed to make peace with the Kashmiri people, whose grievances are the excuse for terrorism. Five criminals have shown how friendly the region is to terrorism. Sadly but surely, more will follow them. ","A victory for the hijackers of an Indian airliner ; another worry for the region

INDIA paraded its missiles and tanks along with its singers and dancers in the celebrations in Delhi on January 26th to mark its 5oth anniversary as a republic. But there is a grim sense in the capital that the hardware may soon be pointed north and west, towards Pakistan. Relations between the two nuclear powers, never good, have worsened steadily since Pakistan tried unsuccessfully to seize a chunk of Kashmir, a disputed northern state, from India last spring. The general regarded by India as largely responsible for the invasion has since taken power in Pakistan in a coup. A group of terrorists hijacked an Indian Airlines jet in December, an operation planned, India alleges, by Pakistan. 
More battles, real and rhetorical, have since erupted. India and Pakistan have accused each other's armies of crossing the ""line of control"", which divides Indian Kashmir from the part of the state administered by Pakistan. India claims that at least 25 Pakistani soldiers were killed in their unsuccessful raid on a border post. The defence minister said on January 24th that Pakistan's nuclear weapons would not deter India from fighting a limited conventional war in selfdefence. General Pervez Musharraf, Pakistan's ruler, was as blunt: ""We will teach [India] a lesson"" if it crosses the line of control, he said. 
Is the ""ugly stability"" between India and Pakistan about to degenerate into something still uglier? There is a feeling in Delhi that Indian patience with Pakistani provocation is about to snap. Pessimists point out that the prime minister, Atal Behari Vajpayee, was humiliated by the hijacking, which ended with India surrendering three militants who had fought Indian rule in Kashmir in exchange for the passengers' lives. one of the freed men has been touring Pakistan unmolested calling for a jihad (holy war) against India. Another has reportedly slipped back into Indian-controlled Kashmir, where there is already mayhem enough. 
Militancy in Kashmir has become more lethal since Pakistan pulled out in July. Last year was a bleak one for killings of Indian security personnel in Kashmir's decade-long insurgency. An observer says that the ratio of militants to security personnel killed has changed from three to one to two to one. There is a lot of anger in Delhi, says one analyst, and ""anger is not a strategy"". 
Stability has hinged mainly on India's willingness to restrain its anger. Pakistan has long supported insurgency in Kashmir, and possession of nuclear weapons may have made it bolder. You do not have to take India's view of Pakistani perfidy to believe that idea. The United States, for example, says it has no evidence that Pakistan's government planned the recent aircraft hijacking but acknowledges that it has provided ""general support"" to groups active in Kashmir, including Harkat ul-Mujahideen, which has been linked to the hijacking. Certainly, Pakistan's army would not have trespassed so blatantly into Kashmir last spring without the comfort of a nuclear shield. India managed to expel the intruders without crossing into Pakistani territory, winning world sympathy in the process. 
Now parts of India's establishment seem to be arguing that Pakistan's nukes and a desire for world approbation should not inhibit India's response to provocation. General V.P. Malik, chief of India's army, said recently that india's restraint ""may not be applicable to the next war"". 
In contrast with Pakistani soldiers, however, Indian military men take their orders from the civilian government. And until now, at least, Mr Vajpayee has ordered them to fight back only on Indian territory. one western diplomat argues that pressure on Mr Vajpayee to cross the border, say by bombing one of the militants' camps, is less than it was last summer, when Pakistan had occupied Indian territory and a general election in India was in the offing. He believes that Mr Vajpayee and his foreign minister, jaswant Singh, will continue to resist the soldiers and hardliners who want India to retaliate more sharply. 
India's threats may in fact make war less likely. Pakistan's provocations are intended to keep world attention on Kashmir, but it is not in Pakistan's interests to push too far. officials in Pakistan acknowledge that it has nothing to gain from a war, especially when it faces international pressure to restore democracy and to fight terrorism, and needs foreign loans to keep its economy going. 
The most influential outsider of all, Bill Clinton, is about to step into this mess. An announcement is expected any day now, of dates for the first visit by an American president to South Asia in 22 years; it will probably take place in the second half of March. The original idea had been to correct America's neglect of India, a friend of the Soviet Union during the cold war (though Bangladesh is also thought to be on the itinerary). America wants to improve ties to the second-most-populous nuclear power and to get India to uphold international non-proliferation agreements, especially the Comprehensive Test-Ban Treaty. 
After the flare-up between India and Pakistan, the bridge-building visit is in danger of turning into a fire-fighting mission. Mr Clinton's advisers seem undecided whether to put Pakistan on the president's itinerary. India has been hoping that the coup, the hijacking and stem American words about links between agencies of government and Harkat ul-Mujahideen will persuade Mr Clinton to shun Pakistan. But the United States has been reluctant to isolate Pakistan, for example, by branding it a state supporter of terrorism, lest that should set off unrest in which even more objectionable leaders could supplant General Musharraf. 
If, however, Mr Clinton does visit Pakistan, especially without some big concession by the Pakistanis, India is bound to conclude that America is so worried about war that it will try brokering peace. Pakistan would claim that as recognition that Kashmir is dangerous enough to warrant international intervention. India would seethe. 
There is little hope of Pakistan and India making peace on their own any time soon. Amid the sabre-rattling, General Musharraf has been suggesting that they should at least start talking. Like every other Pakistani leader, he insists that Kashmir is the main issue. He recently told the Hindu, an Indian newspaper, that issues of more interest to India could be discussed at the same time. India says there is no point in talking again until Pakistan stops cross-border terrorism. This the general is unlikely to do. South Asia will therefore be lucky to keep the violence at its current horrible pitch. ","Relations have deteriorated , but India and Pakistan may stop short of war

Bill Clinton's visit, beginning on March 19th, is being seen as a proof of the emergence of India as an economic and strategic powerhouse in Asia. There's just one problem-Pakistan 
SHIV NADAR is a bicontinental billionaire. His firm, HCL Technologies, writes Internet software and manages networks for western companies, a business that has Mr Nadar shuttling between Noida, a business park near Delhi, and Sunnyvale, California. A video link between Noida and one of his American customers, a Connecticut-based dot.corn company, is turned offand on as casually as a light switch, says Mr Nadar. Connecticut ""has to feel like the next room."" 
Mr Nadar's high-tech light switch tells you a lot about why Bill Clinton is going to the subcontinent, the first visit by an American president in 22 years. Mr Clinton will spend part of a day in Bangladesh and a tense few hours with Pakistan's new military ruler, Pervez Musharraf, but the focus is India. There he will spend five days celebrating India's democracy, appreciating its high-tech prowess and posing before its monuments. The message will be that India matters in a way it did not when it was merely a democratic but impoverished giant. India is that still, but in the past decade it has opened up its economy and raised its growth rate. More recently it has added the pzazz of high-tech mastery and the chilling majesty of a nuclearweapons capability. A geopolitical orphan for too long, India now seeks a leading role in Asian and global councils. it expects to be recognised as ""a factor for stability in Asia"", says its foreign minister, Jaswant Singh. 
It is not that simple. For India is also fighting a low-level proxy war with Pakistan in Kashmir, a Muslim-majority state that both countries claim. On both sides there are threats of escalation, which could lead to the world's first full-scale war between nuclear powers. Pakistan's military-led government is tolerated by the United States only because it is thought to be an alternative to something far worse, rule by Islamic extremists. As Mr Clinton remarked ten days before heading to Delhi, South Asia is ""the most dangerous place in the world right now."" 
India has more or less told him to shut up in public about the subcontinent's perils. The discontent with Indian rule in Kashmir is an internal matter, the dispute with Pakistan a bilateral one. When Mr Clinton meets General Musharraf, India expects him to dress the general down. The president will not be asked to mediate, and it seems that his appeals for new talks with Pakistan will be resisted. The American Senate's rejection of the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty (CTBT) has undermined efforts to get India to sign it. Most of what Mr Clinton has to say about Kashmir and India's nuclear weapons will have to be said in private. Both sides say the visit is for building trust rather than making breakthroughs. The Americans evidently hope that by biting their tongues now, at least in public, they can make gradual progress on headline issues such as non-proliferation and the Indo-Pakistan conflict. Progress on issues such as energy, health and the environment ""can help create space for constructive activity in other areas over time,"" says the American ambassador to India, Richard Celeste. But can India, Pakistan and the world afford to wait? 
From non-alignment to convergence 
Trust between the United States and India was an early casualty of the cold war. In 1956 the American secretary of state, John Foster Dulles, called India's position of non-alignment ""immoral"", and the United States then went on to find sound geopolitical reasons for cosying up to Pakistan. Unsurprisingly, India became a good friend of the Soviet Union. But since the early 1990s, despite the setback of India's 1998 nuclear tests, Indian and American interests have slowly converged. 
The public reason, about which there will be much hullaballoo during this visit, is economic. Since 1991, when a balance-of-payments crisis threatened, India has been shedding its socialist legacies. It has opened up its economy to world trade and started to privatise, albeit too slowly in both respects. The coming to power two years ago of Atal Behari Vajpayee's Bharatiya Janata Party, which leads the coalition government, has probably hastened that process. Although the Hindu-nationalist party has a xenophobic streak, it has also been friendlier to business and more hostile to communism than the opposition Congress party, which dominated Indian politics for most of its past 50 years of independence. High-tech businesses like HCL Technologies help enormously by showing that India has more to gain than lose from competing in the global marketplace. Perhaps for the first time since inventing the zero, India has a hot product to sell and can keep the profits for itself 
All this is entwining India with the rest of the world, and especially with the United States, in new ways. Software exports are growing at a rate Of 50% a year, and around two-thirds of them go to the United States. much of that is serviced by Indians on temporary work visas; India gets about a third of these, and hopes that Mr Clinton will increase them. Indian companies are listing on American stock exchanges; Indian Americans, an increasingly rich community, are lobbying on behalf of India in their adopted country and investing in their native land. A global bidding war has broken out for Indian brains. 
Increasingly, these days, India is being treated with more respect in economic councils. When new-economy issues, such as e-commerce, come up at the World Trade Organisation, India and the United States find themselves on the same side. On oldeconomy issues, ideological clashes have given way to tough-minded bargaining. India supports a Millennium Round of trade talks, but rejects the United States' linkage of trade to labour standards. The Indians want faster liberalisation of the textile and clothing trades; the United States wants better enforcement of intellectual- property protection. 
Few, if any, of these disputes will be solved during Mr Clinton's visit. There is some heady talk of an Indo-American free-trade agreement, an idea Mr Singh thinks worth exploring. But there are limits to any economic partnership. Like dot.com shares, India's economy is more exciting for its potential than for its current performance. Though it is the world's fifth-largest economy in terms of purchasing power, it accounts for less than i% of world trade and attracted just $2.5 billion in foreign direct investment in 1998, about a twentieth of China's. The United States has a bigger economic stake in India than any other single country, but would barely notice ifthat commerce dried up. 
Eyeing China 
The second point of convergence between Indian and American interests is one that may get no public mention on this visit. it is this: that some strategists are beginning to think of India as a counterweight to China. The world is beginning to notice that India has nearly the same number of people as China, plus a more benign system of government and no designs on its neighbours. China-hawks in both India and America dream of a ""strategic partnership"" between the two great democracies. 
That will not happen, at least not soon. Both countries have reason to be wary of China. It supplied much of Pakistan's nuclear-weapons technology and beat India in a 1962 war; in places their borders are still disputed. China menaces Taiwan, an American friend, and could someday threaten other allies. Yet neither India nor the United States wants their friendship to be seen as the start of an anti-China axis. India is trying to end the chill that set in after 1998, when it declared China to be the main target of its nuclear weapons. The United States wants to ""engage"" China, not isolate it. Some people, such as Richard Haass, of the Brookings institution, a Washington think-tank, wonder whether India and the United States can agree on an approach to Asia, and thus to China. Maybe not. Nonetheless, both must be aware that today's friendship could become tomorrow's alliance if China turns hostile, a relationship ""that's there in time of need"", as Mr Haass obliquely puts it. 
Thanks to its economic and strategic potential, India has become something of a belle at the geopolitical ball less than two years after offending the world by declaring itself a nuclear power. Pascal Lamy, the European Union's new trade commissioner, made India his first stop this month outside the three biggest of the EUS trading partners. Mr Vajpayee is to attend an EU Summit in Lisbon in June. Mr Haass, who is tipped for a top job should the Republicans win the American presidential election, says that the Indo-American relationship ""will be more important to the next administration."" There is speculation that the Republican candidate-apparent, George W. Bush, will visit India before the election. 
India's foreign minister, Mr Singh, would like to parlay this attention into a bigger role for India abroad. India has links to ASEAN and APEC, the two main Asian country groupings, but is a full member of neither. Mr Singh thinks India ought to belong to the ""six-plus-two"" group of countries trying to settle Afghanistan's civil war. And of course he has his eye on the ultimate prize, a permanent seat on the UN Security Council. 
The United States may be amenable to some of this. Mr Haass, for one, thinks councils of ""countries that count"" could be expanded to include India. But the burden of history is not so easily shed. Mr Haass points out that the Indian-American relationship lacks the ""warm, vague feelings"" that sustain older friendships. He expects Japan and Korea to remain the basis of stability in Asia. Many Indians do not see a strategic embrace as a result of this visit. Mr Singh calls the trip ""directional, not so much destinational"". 
Nuclear weapons will remain the biggest inhibition. The two countries have agreed to disagree about India's nuclear status; India will not sign the CTBT quickly (and some scientists are urging more tests, which would be a diplomatic disaster), but it is co-operating with the United States on issues such as the control of nuclear exports. There is much international scepticism about India's ability to manage a nuclear arsenal safely, and it is Indian and Pakistani nukes that stop the Kashmir conflict from being a little local difficulty. These issues will brake India's geopolitical progress. One American diplomat describes permanent membership of the Security Council as a ""very big carrot"". To support India's bid with enthusiasm ""would require a much cooler situation in South Asia."" 
The Kashmir tussle 
President Clinton will be lucky to have any influence on the impasse over Kashmir. This is not Kosovo, where the United States could lead an intervention to end a civil war, nor is it Chechnya, where outsiders can only wring their hands. in the Middle East, Israel has come to value peace more highly than land, and so has been willing to strike bargains with its enemies. That is not so in Kashmir, whose fate is bound up in the founding principles of India and Pakistan. 
India is basically satisfied with the twothirds of the state it held on to after its first war with Pakistan in October 1947. To surrender it would undermine India's idea of itself as a multi-religious, secular state. Pakistan wants ""self-determination"" for the Muslim-majority state, in effect a choice between itself and India (though many Kashmiris might prefer neither). The proxy war it sponsors there is ruinous to its economy, bad for its diplomacy and has little prospect of dislodging India. Yet it perseveres because to stop would mean surrender. 
These contradictions were briefly finessed a year ago, when Mr Vajpayee took a bus to Lahore and agreed with Pakistan's then prime minister, Nawaz Sharif, to settle all their disputes, including Kashmir, peacefully. Whether India really intended to negotiate about Kashmir, which it regards as an integral part of its territory, may never be known because, even before Lahore, Pakistan had secretly sent ""freedom fighters"" and its own troops to occupy positions near Kargil, well inside India's part of Kashmir, in effect shifting the ""line of control"" that had been the provisional border. India dislodged them last summer with a combination of force and diplomatic pressure. Mr Sharif has since been ousted in a coup by General Musharraf, whom Indians regard as the mastermind of the Kargil occupation. 
To Pakistanis, the general is still a cipher. When seizing power last October, he promised to restore ""true democracy"" and to renovate Pakistan's corroded institutions. He has made some progress, by prosecuting corrupt figures from past regimes and moving towards local elections at the end of this year. Civil servants are showing up to work on time, a sign of at least some improvement in administration. But the military-led government often blights its claim to be liberal. This week, for example, it charged the wife of the deposed prime minister with treason for speaking against the government. 
There are worries, as well, about the economy. Although exports and imports are both rising, the government has not done enough, especially on widening the tax base, to attract a long-awaited team from the IMF. Without an IMF imprimatur, Pakistan will face another cash crisis when its current debt-rescheduling agreements run out. Many Pakistanis read Mr Clinton's decision to stop by, however briefly, as a vote of confidence in the government and hence in the economy. That is a mistake. Mr Clinton is more likely to scold General Musharraf, and he could threaten to link IMF funds to regional good behaviour. 
The dislodging of the Kargil fighters has not brought peace. Instead, the Pakistan-sponsored militancy has intensified; more mernbers of India's security forces died in Kashmir last year than in any year since the insurgency began a decade ago. India refuses to talk to Pakistan until it ends its backing for violence. Pakistan is willing to talk, but disclaims responsibility for the violence and has distanced itself from earlier agreements, which pledge the two sides to settle their differences peacefully and bilaterally. 
This looks like a stalemate, but could easily become something worse. Pakistan could step up the insurgency once spring clears the mountain passes of snow, or perhaps even try another Kargil. Or Indian patience could snap. India's defence minister, George Fernandes, who has talked of the possibility of a limited conventional war against Pakistan, says that, at the current level of provocation, India will not cross the line of control. in the case of another Kargil, though, he ""cannot completely rule it out."" other top Indian officials downplay this tough military talk. But the logic of escalation has no certain terminus short of nuclear war. 
Third-party tail-twisting 
Mr Clinton is unlikely to observe strictly the Indian ban on third-party involvement. ""We can facilitate without being facilitators"" and without ""in any way going beyond the wishes of India and Pakistan,"" says one American diplomat. America's fondest wish is to resurrect the Lahore commitment to settle matters with talks, not guns. Failing that, Mr Clinton may push for more limited talks on ways to avoid accidental war,conventional or nuclear. Perhaps he will privately solicit a commitment by India to reduce its armed strength in Kashmir in return for a marked de-escalation of the Pakistanbacked insurgency. He will certainly urge India to maintain its policy of restraint in responding to Pakistan's provocations. 
But no one on the subcontinent can breathe easily as long as those provocations continue. India did not want the president to stop in Islamabad, but his message to General Musharraf is likely to be one India would endorse: rein in the Kashmiri militancy, resume the Lahore process and chart a course for restoring democracy. (Mr Clinton also wants the general to push Afghanistan's Taliban government to hand over an alleged terrorist, Osama bin Laden, an item lower down on India's wish-list.) 
General Musharraf's willingness to do any of this depends partly on his conscience but largely on how he weighs up various threats to his rule. The United States has leverage, largely in the form of western aid to prop up Pakistan's economy, but the country's hawks, including Islamic fundamentalists, seem to have more. They put a quick stop to talk of Pakistan signing the CTBT, for example. General Musharraf seems to be betting that the United States will indulge him because the alternative is worse. As for curbing the Kashmiri insurgency, General Musharraf claims to be unable to (the militant groups do what they want), is probably afraid to (lest the militants take revenge) and probably does not want to. Peace, he realises, can only strengthen India's hold on Kashmir. 
If India were wise, it would seek to reconcile Pakistan and the Kashmiri people to that outcome. instead, the alienation is deepening. According to Ravi Nair of the South Asia Human Rights Documentation Centre in Delhi, incidents of torture and ""extra-judicial killing"" have gone up since Kargil. Cordon-and-search operations, which had been narrowed to spare civilians, have again become less discriminate, says Mr Nair. If General Musharraf had any inclination to discourage insurgency, tales of Indian repression would make it harder. 
There are rumours in Delhi that the government is seeking to open a dialogue with separatist Kashmiri leaders, most of whom are in jail. They are said by Indian sources to be tired of insurgency and of Pakistan's overweening role in it. The idea of a separate peace with the Kashmiri people faces countless obstacles: among them, the Indian government's alliance with a state government widely regarded as corrupt and ineffectual, and the repression-breeding insurgency. The better the atmosphere within Kashmir, however, the harder it will be for Pakistan to justify its reckless proxy war. 
Mr Clinton may well leave the subcontinent uncertain whether to feel hope, anxiety or despair. The challenge of doing justice to India's strengths while curbing, without seeming to, its disruptive impulses would test anyone's acumen. it is even harder to make any headway with Pakistan, a country that is unstable in every sense. The two nuclear neighbours, so keen to show the president their good sides, are locked in a spiral of bad behaviour that Mr Clinton can do very little to change. He will soon know the truth of that at first hand. ","DELHI 
 Bill Clinton 's visit , beginning on March 19th , is being seen as a proof of the emergence of India as an economic and strategic powerhouse in Asia . There 's just one problem - Pakistan 
 SHIV NADAR is a bicontinental billionaire . His firm , HCL Technologies , writes Internet software and manages networks for western companies , a business that has Mr Nadar shuttling between Noida , a business park near Delhi , and Sunnyvale , California . A video link between Noida and one of his American customers , a Connecticut - based dot.corn company , is turned offand on as casually as a light switch , says Mr Nadar . Connecticut "" has to feel like the next room . "" 
 Mr Nadar 's high - tech light switch tells you a lot about why Bill Clinton is going to the subcontinent , the first visit by an American president in 22 years . Mr Clinton will spend part of a day in Bangladesh and a tense few hours with Pakistan 's new military ruler , Pervez Musharraf , but the focus is India . There he will spend five days celebrating India 's democracy , appreciating its high - tech prowess and posing before its monuments . The message will be that India matters in a way it did not when it was merely a democratic but impoverished giant . India is that still , but in the past decade it has opened up its economy and raised its growth rate . More recently it has added the pzazz of high - tech mastery and the chilling majesty of a nuclearweapons capability . A geopolitical orphan for too long , India now seeks a leading role in Asian and global councils . it expects to be recognised as "" a factor for stability in Asia "" , says its foreign minister , Jaswant Singh . 
 It is not that simple . For India is also fighting a low - level proxy war with Pakistan in Kashmir , a Muslim - majority state that both countries claim . On both sides there are threats of escalation , which could lead to the world 's first full - scale war between nuclear powers . Pakistan 's military - led government is tolerated by the United States only because it is thought to be an alternative to something far worse , rule by Islamic extremists . As Mr Clinton remarked ten days before heading to Delhi , South Asia is "" the most dangerous place in the world right now . "" 
 India has more or less told him to shut up in public about the subcontinent 's perils . The discontent with Indian rule in Kashmir is an internal matter , the dispute with Pakistan a bilateral one . When Mr Clinton meets General Musharraf , India expects him to dress the general down . The president will not be asked to mediate , and it seems that his appeals for new talks with Pakistan will be resisted . The American Senate 's rejection of the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty ( CTBT ) has undermined efforts to get India to sign it . Most of what Mr Clinton has to say about Kashmir and India 's nuclear weapons will have to be said in private . Both sides say the visit is for building trust rather than making breakthroughs . The Americans evidently hope that by biting their tongues now , at least in public , they can make gradual progress on headline issues such as non - proliferation and the Indo - Pakistan conflict . Progress on issues such as energy , health and the environment "" can help create space for constructive activity in other areas over time , "" says the American ambassador to India , Richard Celeste . But can India , Pakistan and the world afford to wait ? 
 From non - alignment to convergence 
 Trust between the United States and India was an early casualty of the cold war . In 1956 the American secretary of state , John Foster Dulles , called India 's position of non - alignment "" immoral "" , and the United States then went on to find sound geopolitical reasons for cosying up to Pakistan . Unsurprisingly , India became a good friend of the Soviet Union . But since the early 1990s , despite the setback of India 's 1998 nuclear tests , Indian and American interests have slowly converged . 
 The public reason , about which there will be much hullaballoo during this visit , is economic . Since 1991 , when a balance - of - payments crisis threatened , India has been shedding its socialist legacies . It has opened up its economy to world trade and started to privatise , albeit too slowly in both respects . The coming to power two years ago of Atal Bihari Vajpayee's Bharatiya Janata Party , which leads the coalition government , has probably hastened that process . Although the Hindu - nationalist party has a xenophobic streak , it has also been friendlier to business and more hostile to communism than the opposition Congress party , which dominated Indian politics for most of its past 50 years of independence . High - tech businesses like HCL Technologies help enormously by showing that India has more to gain than lose from competing in the global marketplace . Perhaps for the first time since inventing the zero , India has a hot product to sell and can keep the profits for itself 
 All this is entwining India with the rest of the world , and especially with the United States , in new ways . Software exports are growing at a rate Of 50 % a year , and around two - thirds of them go to the United States . much of that is serviced by Indians on temporary work visas ; India gets about a third of these , and hopes that Mr Clinton will increase them . Indian companies are listing on American stock exchanges ; Indian Americans , an increasingly rich community , are lobbying on behalf of India in their adopted country and investing in their native land . A global bidding war has broken out for Indian brains . 
 Increasingly , these days , India is being treated with more respect in economic councils . When new - economy issues , such as e - commerce , come up at the World Trade Organisation , India and the United States find themselves on the same side . On oldeconomy issues , ideological clashes have given way to tough - minded bargaining . India supports a Millennium Round of trade talks , but rejects the United States ' linkage of trade to labour standards . The Indians want faster liberalisation of the textile and clothing trades ; the United States wants better enforcement of intellectual- property protection .

EVERY time something good happens, such actions take place,"" observed-india's national security adviser, Brajesh Mishra.By ""something good"" he meant Bill Clinton's visit to India, the first by an American president in 22 years. His mission: to warm relations between two giant democracies that have been at odds more often than not. ""Such actions"" are the horrible murder on the eve of Mr Clinton's visit Of 35 Sikh villagers in Kashmir, a Muslim-majority state that India mostly controls and Pakistan covets. The massacre seemed to draw India and the United States closer. 
As Mr Clinton left Delhi to spot tigers in Rajasthan and then to hobnob with entrepreneurs and health workers in Hyderabad and Mumbai, India's prime minister, Atal Behari Vajpayee, was close to being able to claim a diplomatic triumph. Less than two years after earning global opprobrium by testing nuclear weapons, India has bleached, if not erased, two disfiguring stigmas: its status as a rogue nuclear power and its image as the squabbling sibling of its problem neighbour, Pakistan. Mr Clinton showed that neither would stop the United States from treating India as a rising geopolitical power and a potential economic one. on India's explosive relations with Pakistan, which could lead to all-out war between nuclear powers, Mr Clinton came close to endorsing the Indian view that it is up to Pakistan to take the first step toward dialogue. 
That does not mean that America has forgotten its worries about how India will handle its nuclear weapons or its fears that the clash with Pakistan will lead to war, perhaps nuclear war. As Mr Clinton hinted in his speech to the Indian Parliament on March 22nd, Indo-American relations will not reach their full potential until differences on nuclear proliferation are settled. But India's potential-and its prickliness-argue for broadening relations beyond the earlier American obsession with nuclear weapons, and hope that greater trust leads to progress on issues of war and peace. By the end of Mr Clinton's deft speech to Parliament, which managed both to lecture and to flatter, India's lawmakers were smitten. 
The main fruit of Mr Clinton's visit so far is an agreement on ""institutional dialogue"", intended in part to help the new friendship outlast Mr Clinton's dwindling term as president. In addition to summits (Mr Vajpayee will visit Washington before Mr Clinton leaves office) and annual meetings of foreign ministers, India and America will have ""dialogues"" and ""forums"" on terrorism, Asian security, technology, trade and several other subjects. An Asian Centre for Democratic Governance is to be set up in Delhi, to the possible annoyance of undemocratic China, Asia's other potential superpower. This ""dialogue architecture"" is supposed to replace the sporadic contacts of the past with the sort of toing and froing that marks American relations with friends like Germany and big powers like China. 
Agreeing to talk is not the same thing as agreeing. Mr Clinton's visit did not resolve disputes on trade. India rejects the United States' linkage of freer trade to higher labour and environmental standards in developing countries, and turned down an American suggestion that they should jointly call for a resurrection of the millennium round of multilateral trade talks. The United States gave India little satisfaction on its request for more temporary work visas for its growing army of computer programmers. Mr Vajpayee can do more to promote trade and investment by cutting red tape than by talking to Mr Clinton. 
The friendship will also cool if there is disappointment on the nuclear front. in their ""vision statement"", America and India promised to forgo further nuclear tests to cooperate on a treaty to end the production of fissile materials and to control exports of nuclear technology. The United States hopes that in the next few months it will produce something more tangible, such as India's signature on the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty, even though the American Senate has so far refused to ratify it. 
The apparent accord between India and the United States on Kashmir may make that more likely. It also puts the onus for reducing regional tensions squarely on the leader of Pakistan's military government, Pervez Musharraf, whom Mr Clinton will briefly visit on his way home. The United States stopped short of backing India's claim that the massacre of Sikhs was the work of Hizbul Mujahideen and Lashkar-e-Toiba, two Pakistan-linked militant groups ""supported by the government""; Pakistan's foreign minister ""strongly condemned"" the killings. Nor has America endorsed the unofficial Indian view that the best way to solve the Kashmir dispute is to turn the line of control into the permanent border with Pakistan. 
Yet Mr Clinton cheered the Indians by repeatedly calling for the line of control to be respected, which Indians interpret as a demand that Pakistan should end its support for cross-border terrorism. if the United States exerted any pressure on India to improve its treatment of the people in its zone of Kashmir, it did so privately. And, in an apparent shift of American policy, Mr Clinton came close to endorsing India's refusal to talk to Pakistan until it ends its backing for the militancy in Kashmir, saying, ""You cannot expect a dialogue to go forward unless there is an absence of violence."" Madeleine Albright, the secretary of state, denied that the United States had changed its policy on Kashmir. Nonetheless, it is Pakistan that is now on the spot. 
Mr Clinton presumably hopes to elicit from General Musharraf a commitment to rein in the militancy in Kashmir in return for an Indian agreement to resume dialogue on the disputed state. That is not impossible, but neither is it likely. Pakistan publicly denies giving the ""freedom fighters"" material support. General Musharraf is under pressure, both from militant groups and from hardliners within the army, to yield nothing. And he must yield more than a little to tempt India back to the negotiating table; its position is that violence must cease. 
On March 23rd, General Musharraf tried to placate the United States by outlining plans for restoring democracy to Pakistan. He said that a series of district-level elections would start in December and there would be moves ""step by step"" to provincial and national elections ""in due course of time"". That would be pleasing, but it would not be enough. Perhaps the best that can be hoped for is a commitment that would merely stop things from getting worse rather than making them better: that is, to refrain from trying anything like last spring's offensive in Kashmir, which brought India and Pakistan to the brink of all-out war. India held back from attacking Pakistan's territory during the ""Kargil crisis"" and the United States helped by pressing Pakistan to withdraw. But if there is another Kargil crisis, India just might be tempted to rely rather less on diplomacy and rather more on force of arms. ","By making friends with India , the American president has increased the pressure on the military government in Pakistan 
 EVERY time something good happens , such actions take place , "" observed - india 's national security adviser , Brajesh Mishra . By "" something good "" he meant Bill Clinton 's visit to India , the first by an American president in 22 years . His mission : to warm relations between two giant democracies that have been at odds more often than not . "" Such actions "" are the horrible murder on the eve of Mr Clinton 's visit Of 35 Sikh villagers in Kashmir , a Muslim - majority state that India mostly controls and Pakistan covets . The massacre seemed to draw India and the United States closer . 
 As Mr Clinton left Delhi to spot tigers in Rajasthan and then to hobnob with entrepreneurs and health workers in Hyderabad and Mumbai , Atal Bihari Vajpayee's , was close to being able to claim a diplomatic triumph . Less than two years after earning global opprobrium by testing nuclear weapons , India has bleached , if not erased , two disfiguring stigmas : its status as a rogue nuclear power and its image as the squabbling sibling of its problem neighbour , Pakistan . Mr Clinton showed that neither would stop the United States from treating India as a rising geopolitical power and a potential economic one . on India 's explosive relations with Pakistan , which could lead to all - out war between nuclear powers , Mr Clinton came close to endorsing the Indian view that it is up to Pakistan to take the first step toward dialogue . 
 That does not mean that America has forgotten its worries about how India will handle its nuclear weapons or its fears that the clash with Pakistan will lead to war , perhaps nuclear war . As Mr Clinton hinted in his speech to the Indian Parliament on March 22nd , Indo - American relations will not reach their full potential until differences on nuclear proliferation are settled . But India 's potential - and its prickliness - argue for broadening relations beyond the earlier American obsession with nuclear weapons , and hope that greater trust leads to progress on issues of war and peace . By the end of Mr Clinton 's deft speech to Parliament , which managed both to lecture and to flatter , India 's lawmakers were smitten . 
 The main fruit of Mr Clinton 's visit so far is an agreement on "" institutional dialogue "" , intended in part to help the new friendship outlast Mr Clinton 's dwindling term as president . In addition to summits ( Atal Bihari Vajpayee will visit Washington before Mr Clinton leaves office ) and annual meetings of foreign ministers , India and America will have "" dialogues "" and "" forums "" on terrorism , Asian security , technology , trade and several other subjects . An Asian Centre for Democratic Governance is to be set up in Delhi , to the possible annoyance of undemocratic China , Asia 's other potential superpower . This "" dialogue architecture "" is supposed to replace the sporadic contacts of the past with the sort of toing and froing that marks American relations with friends like Germany and big powers like China . 
 Agreeing to talk is not the same thing as agreeing . Mr Clinton 's visit did not resolve disputes on trade . India rejects the United States ' linkage of freer trade to higher labour and environmental standards in developing countries , and turned down an American suggestion that they should jointly call for a resurrection of the millennium round of multilateral trade talks . The United States gave India little satisfaction on its request for more temporary work visas for its growing army of computer programmers . Atal Bihari Vajpayee can do more to promote trade and investment by cutting red tape than by talking to Mr Clinton . 
 The friendship will also cool if there is disappointment on the nuclear front . in their "" vision statement "" , America and India promised to forgo further nuclear tests to cooperate on a treaty to end the production of fissile materials and to control exports of nuclear technology . The United States hopes that in the next few months it will produce something more tangible , such as India 's signature on the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty , even though the American Senate has so far refused to ratify it . 
 The apparent accord between India and the United States on Kashmir may make that more likely . It also puts the onus for reducing regional tensions squarely on the leader of Pakistan 's military government , Pervez Musharraf , whom Mr Clinton will briefly visit on his way home . The United States stopped short of backing India 's claim that the massacre of Sikhs was the work of Hizbul Mujahideen and Lashkar - e - Toiba , two Pakistan - linked militant groups "" supported by the government "" ; Pakistan 's foreign minister "" strongly condemned "" the killings . Nor has America endorsed the unofficial Indian view that the best way to solve the Kashmir dispute is to turn the line of control into the permanent border with Pakistan .

WHEN, 30 years ago, Indira Gandhi cried ""Garibi hatao""-abolish poverty-her slogan electrified India and delivered victory to her Congress party in the 1971 election. Mrs Gandhi's policies, which included spurning imports and wrapping business in red tape, meant that poverty fell less swiftly than it should have done. But her heirs are alive and well, and now they claim to have statistics on their side. Recent evidence suggests that India's decade-old economic reforms have boosted growth without making much of a dent in poverty. The consensus in favour of reform is breaking down, said the finance minister, Yashwant Sinha, recently. 
The sceptics have a case. Although the economy grew at over 7.5% a year in the mid-i99os, the proportion of Indians living in poverty dropped just one percentage point between 1993-94 and 1997, to 34%, according to the World Bank. In rural areas, home to most Indians and most of the poor, there was even less progress. In the country as a whole, the proportion of people living in poverty fell faster before reform, from 54% in 1973-74 to 38% in 1986-87. ""The latest numbers appear to be a vote for Indira Gandhi and a vote against Manmohan Singly"" the father of reform, observed the Times of India. If anyone benefited, runs the indictment of liberalisation, it was the urban rich. The war over that charge is raging from the pages of scholarly journals to the floor of Parliament. 
Reformers offer two ripostes: first, that the data are misleading and, second, that to the extent they are accurate, they reflect the faint-heartedness of reformers to date. There is merit in both arguments. To some extent, the dispute is between two sets of data. The national accounts, produced by the Central Statistical Organisation, have shown consumption shooting up and, because inequality seems to have been stable, poverty falling sharply. When poverty began to look as if it was disappearing, India's powerful states objected-not simply because the appearance was misleading but because their entitlement to central-government aid depended largely on their poverty rates. 
Until the mid-1990s, these were based on the national accounts. Now the official poverty estimate is derived from the National Sample Survey (NSS), which asks households what they consume. The differences between the two calculations are dramatic. The Hss has consumption growing at roughly 1 1/4% a year between 1973-74 and 1993-94; the national accounts say it grew at a rate of 3 1/2%. In the past 30 years, the NSS estimate of consumption has dropped from three-quarters of that in the national accounts to two-thirds. C. P. Chandrashekhar, an economist at Jawaharlal Nehru University in Delhi, argues that the Nss is right for most Indians. What it misses is rising consumption by the very rich, who downplay their extravagance when the survey people come calling. Consumption by the poor was probably depressed during the 1990s by higher food prices, themselves the product of reforms, according to critics. 
Though surveys should yield the more accurate data, there are reasons to think that the NSS nevertheless underestimates both the level of consumption and its rate of growth. Pravin Visaria, the chairman of the Nss's governing council, points out that households are asked what they have eaten over the past 30 days, a relatively long period. He thinks that if the recall period were shortened to a week, reported consumption would be higher. That alone could shave as much as four points off the aggregate poverty rate. 
Nor do the Nss's low estimates of consumption growth match the figures for booming sales during the 1990s, not only of expensive goods such as cars but of simple ones such as toothpaste. In addition, some economists argue against estimating poverty from NSS surveys after 1993-94, since they come from small samples. 
Another possibility is that government statisticians, measuring inflation with consumer-price indices, have raised poverty lines by too much. Using instead the NSS's data on the quantity and value of consumption, Angus Deaton and Alessandro Tarozzi of Princeton University have suggested a smaller adjustment to poverty lines, especially in rural areas. Whereas the rural poverty rate (33% in 1993-94) remains much higher by this reckoning than the urban rate (18%), poverty in both city and country seems to be falling in tandem (by 4 1/2 to 5 1/2 percentage points from 1986-87). In addition, wages for unskilled male farm workers rose about 2.5% a year in real terms during the i99os. That is well below the 4.6% rate in the previous decade, but still suggests something better than stagnation in rural poverty. 
Lastly, the correlation between poverty reduction and growth holds up better at state level. India's poorest states (including, unfortunately, its biggest) both grew more slowly and reduced poverty less than the average in the past two decades. Uttar Pradesh and Bihar, in which about a quarter of India's population live, are generally reckoned to be slower reformers and poorer providers of government services than most rich states. 
The data on which such passions are pinned are inconclusive. Consumption may be growing faster than the Nss suggests, but inequality has probably widened as well, which means that the poor are not benefiting from growth in full measure. Reform has probably been good for poverty, but could have been much better. 
That may be because reform has not gone far enough. Since 1991, India has lowered barriers to imports (though they remain high by international standards) and freed industry from the burden of licensing. Much remains to be done, from curbing public-sector deficits, which keep interest rates high and development spending low, to privatising banks, which would improve their efficiency and boost enterprise. Several potential reforms would directly promote job-creating growth. Abolishing ceilings that limit investment by firms in certain industries, such as shoes and toys, would free them to compete in international markets. Making labour laws more flexible would encourage bigger firms to hire more workers. 
Agriculture has been barely touched by reform. Subsidies (for fertiliser, power and water) promote over-farming and crowd out investment in rural infrastructure, according to the World Bank. Controls on prices and internal trade also blunt investment. 
The prime minister, Atal Behari Vajpayee, and some of his colleagues would like to speed up reforms. The budget announced in February proposes modest but brave cuts in subsidies for fertilisers and food. Mr Vajpayee recently told India's trade unions to prepare for the reform of labour laws. He is said to be eager to speed up privatisation this year to bring down the debt. 
There is little support for this programme among Mr Vajpayee's allies in the coalition government, let alone within the opposition. On April 25th, he hinted that some of the subsidy cuts might be withdrawn. Various ministries are resisting privatisation. The statistics suggest they are doing the poor a favour; experience in most of the world teaches the opposite. ","Has liberalisation helped the poor as much as it should ?

AFTER a brief lull, the battle for Jaffna has resumed. Sri Lanka's 17-year civil war exploded again on May loth when the Tamil Tigers launched a major offensive against the government's forces. The Tigers attacked military units based in villages on the outskirts of Jaffna town, the prospective capital of the Tamil state for which they are fighting. On their own radio station, they warned the town's residents to move to safe places. With 5,000 or so fighters, including women and children, the Tigers are greatly outnumbered by the government's 35,000 or more troops. But the Tigers are fearsome guerrillas and the Sri Lankan army is demoralised, badly trained and under-equipped. Few people in Colombo, Sri Lanka's capital, expect the army will be able to hold on to Jaffna. It may not even keep the local air and sea ports, which it held before capturing Jaffna from the Tigers in 1995. The government would then, for the first time, lose its foothold on the Jaffna peninsula. The rumble of a country about to break up would rock not just Colombo but also Delhi, India's capital. 
It may not come to that. The Sri Lankan army could pull itself together. The Tigers' leader, Velupillai Prabhakaran, will no doubt be tempted to declare independence if he takes Jaffna, but he may think better of it. The Tigers, he knows, are reviled internationally as terrorists; an upstart Tamil state would win virtually no international recognition.Nonetheless, the government's recent reversals have stifled a nascent peace process nurtured by Norway and undermined a search for consensus on the Tamil issue between Sri Lanka's main political parties. 
Colombo is calm, but grim. Last week the government published a 200-page public security act, which imposes blanket censorship and allows the authorities to prohibit demonstrations and confiscate property. Newspapers have taken to publishing white spaces where the censors have mauled their articles. Taxes on cigarettes and alcohol were increased this week to help pay for the military campaign. Sri Lanka, the government has declared, is now on a ""war footing"". 
Fighting resumed after Sri Lanka's president, Chandrika Kumaratunga, rejected an offer by the Tigers of a ceasefire leading to negotiations. She could not afford to accept it, as it entailed surrendering the Jaffna peninsula without a fight. Her defiance does not necessarily improve her position. 
Before the Tigers launched their latest of fensive in April, overrunning Elephant Pass, the link between the peninsula and the rest of Sri Lanka, prospects for a settlement were brightening. Mrs Kumaratunga had survived an assassination attempt, presumably by the Tigers, and had been re-elected in December. Her anger seemed to be mellowing into statesmanship. She began talks with the main opposition leader, Ranil Wickremesinghe, on what sort of autonomy could be of fered to the north and east of the country, the area claimed as the Tamil homeland. The idea was to forge a broad agreement within Sri Lanka's Sinhalese majority, without which no offer to the Tigers would stick. At the same time, Mrs Kumaratunga and Mr Prabhakaran agreed to Norwegian ""facilitation"", which in time might have led to direct negotiations. 
None of that is in prospect now. Citing the crisis, Mrs Kumaratunga has withdrawn from the talks with the opposition party, though they have not been formally broken off. A Norwegian delegation was expected to discuss the crisis with the Indian government in Delhi on May nth, and it may proceed to Colombo after that. But, says a western diplomat, ""the prospects of meaningful discussions at this stage are very, very poor."" 
Fears of a backlash 
It is unclear how much political pressure Mrs Kumaratunga will face to stiffen her line against the Tigers. A parliamentary election is due by October at the latest, which may make it difficult for her to be generous, especially in the face of a military defeat. A new party, Sihala Urumaya (Sinhalese Heritage), has been formed to rally nationalists opposed to compromise with the Tigers. It does not count for much now, but could count for more if Jaffna fell. There is some fear that the Tamils in the south, who are thought to outnumber those in the north and the east, will be attacked. One reason the government gave itself extra powers was no doubt to forestall such chaos breaking out in the south. 
Jehan Perera, the media director of the independent National Peace Council, argues that in some respects the present crisis has improved the chances of peace. The Tigers have been discredited, even among some Tamils, by making war on the eve of peace talks, he believes. And Sri Lankans of all persuasions are now willing to accept international mediation, a prerequisite for a negotiated solution. More than 55,000 people have already been killed in the fighting. No reasonable person wants to see part of Sri Lanka ruled by a force that knows everything about killing and nothing about governing. 
Least of all does India, Sri Lanka's giant neighbour. India has its own separatist worries, especially in the northern Muslim-majority state of Kashmir. It does not want borders in its neighbourhood redrawn along ethnic lines. The Indian government regards Mr Prabhakaran's rise with horror. A battle for Jaffna could send refugees across the Palk Strait to Tamil Nadu, an Indian state with a much bigger Tamil population than Sri Lanka's. Victory in Jaffna could lead to greater Tiger infiltration of Tamil Nadu and the stirring of latent separatism there. 
India has strong reasons to back Mrs Kumaratunga's efforts to keep Sri Lanka whole, but equally strong reasons to be wary. An Indian peacekeeping force in the 1980s antagonised both sides and pulled out after losing 1,000 men. The government is also loth to anger Indian Tamils and their political parties, some of which are part of the ruling coalition, by backing the Sri Lankan government too strongly. India's prime minister, Atal Behari Vajpayee, has so far dodged Sri Lanka's requests for help in evacuating its troops from Jaffna and said no to military assistance. India's government and opposition parties have agreed that Sri Lanka should remain whole and that its minorities should be protected. India has offered to mediate if asked by both sides. 
That balance will be hard to maintain if Mr Prabhakaran conquers Jaffna and evicts the government's forces from the peninsula; even harder if he proclaims a state there. But saying it will not make it so. The Sri Lankan army still controls, at least by day, the main cities claimed by the Tigers in the east. With better connections to the rest of the island, they will not be easily overrun. Indeed, if the army leaves the Jaffna peninsula, its hold on the east could tighten. No matter how stunning their victories, the Tigers will eventually have to come to the negotiating table.

There is some fear that the Tamils in the south, who are thought to outnumber those in the north and the east, will be attacked. One reason the government gave itself extra powers was no doubt to forestall such chaos breaking out in the south. 
Jehan Perera, the media director of the independent National Peace Council, argues that in some respects the present crisis has improved the chances of peace. The Tigers have been discredited, even among some Tamils, by making war on the eve of peace talks, he believes. And Sri Lankans of all persuasions are now willing to accept international mediation, a prerequisite for a negotiated solution. More than 55,000 people have already been killed in the fighting. No reasonable person wants to see part of Sri Lanka ruled by a force that knows everything about killing and nothing about governing. 
Least of all does India, Sri Lanka's giant neighbour. India has its own separatist worries, especially in the northern Muslim-majority state of Kashmir. It does not want borders in its neighbourhood redrawn along ethnic lines. The Indian government regards Mr Prabhakaran's rise with horror. A battle for Jaffna could send refugees across the Palk Strait to Tamil Nadu, an Indian state with a much bigger Tamil population than Sri Lanka's. Victory in Jaffna could lead to greater Tiger infiltration of Tamil Nadu and the stirring of latent separatism there. 
India has strong reasons to back Mrs Kumaratunga's efforts to keep Sri Lanka whole, but equally strong reasons to be wary. An Indian peacekeeping force in the 1980s antagonised both sides and pulled out after losing 1,000 men. The government is also loth to anger Indian Tamils and their political parties, some of which are part of the ruling coalition, by backing the Sri Lankan government too strongly. India's prime minister, Atal Behari Vajpayee, has so far dodged Sri Lanka's requests for help in evacuating its troops from Jaffna and said no to military assistance. India's government and opposition parties have agreed that Sri Lanka should remain whole and that its minorities should be protected. India has offered to mediate if asked by both sides. 
That balance will be hard to maintain if Mr Prabhakaran conquers Jaffna and evicts the government's forces from the peninsula; even harder if he proclaims a state there. But saying it will not make it so. The Sri Lankan army still controls, at least by day, the main cities claimed by the Tigers in the east. With better connections to the rest of the island, they will not be easily overrun. Indeed, if the army leaves the Jaffna peninsula, its hold on the east could tighten. No matter how stunning their victories, the Tigers will eventually have to come to the negotiating table. ",750,India,A29-8257,,False,,0,True

THE solution favoured by the Indian government to its Kashmir problem has taken another knock. It aimed first to use force to make insurrection look hopeless, then to persuade the rebels to accept Indian rule in return for additional autonomy and money. This formula was used successfully in Nagaland and Mizoram, and India hoped it would work in Kashmir too. 
Last week, the chief minister of Kashmir, Farooq Abdullah, upset the Delhi government's plans by demanding autonomy forthwith. The cabinet on July 4th quickly rejected the demand. Autonomy is to be kept in reserve as the ultimate concession to seal a settlement once the Kashmiri militants have been quelled. 
This has put an end to the attempt by Atal Behari Vajpayee, India's prime minister, to launch a peace initiative in the troubled state. To break the impasse, the prime minister had recently sent feelers to the Hurriyat (Freedom), a group of secessionist parties in the state, and released some of its leaders from prison. The Hurriyat has wide popular support but so far has boycotted elections, letting Mr Abdullah's National Conference win with big majorities but govern with little moral authority. 
Mr Abdullah, the Delhi government's local ally in the state, has not been happy with the peace initiative. If the Hurriyat could be persuaded to participate in elections, the National Conference could be wiped out. To counter his reputation among some militants as a quisling of Delhi, Mr Abdullah got the state assembly to pass a resolution demanding autonomy of the sort that existed before 1953. Such a move would mean that the Indian Election Commission, Supreme Court, civil service and government auditors would no longer have any role in the state. Pre-1953 Kashmir had its own constitution and flag and ran almost all of its own services except defence. 
Mr Vajpayee had initially made some noises about autonomy within the Indian union of states being something that could be discussed. But he heads a Hindu-- nationalist party which has long wanted to end even the existing special provisions for Kashmir in the constitution. Hard-liners in the party were livid at Mr Abdullah's ploy. Hence the cabinet's rejection of the plan. Mr Vajpayee said after the cabinet meeting that he would consider any request for more financial and political powers, but there was no going back to the old status. 
This leaves the Hurriyat laughing. It says autonomy is irrelevant and the only solution is azaadi (independence). Mr Vajpayee is looking discomfited. Mr Abdullah is playing the injured innocent, saying he has spoken out for decades on the need for more autonomy. The episode has probably improved his stature in the state slightly. However, he runs such a corrupt and incompetent administration that he cannot become popular merely by standing up to Delhi. 
As soon as the Kashmir assembly asked for autonomy, there were demonstrations against it in two regions of the state, Hindu-- majority Jammu and Buddhist-majority Ladakh. These Hindus and Buddhists fear repression by officials in Srinagar, the state capital, no less than Kashmiri Muslims fear repression by Delhi. It makes a solution even more difficult. Muslims account for twothirds of the population, but are concentrated in the Kashmir Valley, barely one-fifth of the state in area. 
Mr Abdullah's demand for autonomy was promptly echoed by smaller parties in other states with secessionist problems. These included the ruling Asom Gana Parishad in Assam; a hardline faction of the Sikh party in Punjab, the Akali Dal; and a Dravidian party in Tamil Nadu, the MDMK. This fed the fears of those who have long claimed that, if Kashmir is allowed to break away from the Indian union, several other states will go the same way, balkanising the country. The Hurriyat says that such an argument is irrelevant to the rights of Kashmiris. ","India

The Portuguese in Goa, the French in Pondicherry and the British all over the subcontinent found that Hindus and Muslims and other adherents to strong religions were mostly content with their own perceived paths to the Divine. Today, nearly 500 years after the first missionaries arrived, Christians account for fewer than 3% of India's one billion people. Nevertheless, some Indians, Hindus especially, are displeased that there are any Christians in the country at all. Last November, during Pope Paul it's visit to India, he was asked by a Hindu group to apologise for the ""atrocities"" committed by early Roman Catholic priests who, it is now conceded, were overzealous in their proselytising methods. 
The pope on his trips abroad does not submit himself to rude questions by reporters. It fell to Alan de Lastic, archbishop of Delhi, and India's leading Catholic, to make it clear that there would be no apology. ""How far back in history are you going?"" he demanded. Mr de Lastic said he was more concerned about atrocities being committed against Christians in India now. Over the past two years there have been more than 200 reports of attacks on Christians. Thirty churches have been bombed or otherwise damaged. Priests and nuns have been murdered. An Australian missionary and his two young sons were burned to death in his car in Orissa. 
Mr de Lastic said the government was not doing its duty to bring peace and justice to India. ""We are told to fight against Pakistan and be careful about China,"" he said, while the evils at home were being neglected. This was fierce stuff from a senior cleric of a conservative church. But Mr de Lastic was concerned with the earthly problems of his flock, as well as its spiritual needs. India is often lauded as the world's largest democracy, but that grand description flatters a society that tolerates corruption and where life is cheap. Mr de Lastic founded a human rights group, the United Christian Forum, and, to the irritation of non-Christians, saw it as the conscience of the nation. 
Journey of an archbishop 
Alan de Lastic was bom in Burma when it was part of British India. He was partly Burmese, partly Irish and partly French: his paternal grandparents came from Bourg-Lastic, a town in central France. But he was, he said, wholly Indian. He studied marine engineering, and worked for a time in the shipyards of Calcutta. As mystics do, he felt a call to the priesthood. He was spotted as a potential star, and sent to Rome and Dublin for polish. Thereafter he rose rapidly in India's Catholic hierarchy. Mother Teresa (Obituary, September 13th 1997) was a close friend. He was made bishop of Lucknow and, in 1990, archbishop of Delhi. 
The community he led, though relatively small, has been remarkably influential. India's armed forces have had dozens of Christian generals, admirals and air marshals, members either of the Catholic church, or of the 40 or so other Christian denominations in India. Christian groups run thousands of schools and hospitals as well as business enterprises such as rural banks. Missionaries run most leper colonies: many Hindus regard the disease as a punishment for wrongdoing. One way and another, millions of non-Christians benefit from the work of the churches. Why are they being attacked in a country that claims to be tolerant of all religious belief? 
The attacks are usually blamed on members of a militant Hindu group known as Sangh Parivar, or United Family. The group warns Indians of the ""sweet poison"" of Christianity. It complains that Hindus are being converted against their will. Mr de Lastic said that what militant Hindus particularly objected to were Christian schools, especially those in rural areas. Many Hindus acknowledge that they are well run; so much so that they send their own children to them. But by accepting the poorest children as pupils, the Christians are seen as undermining India's Hindu caste system, which remains rigid in many areas. The upper-caste feudal lords fear that, once educated, the previously docile local people would demand new rights and could no longer be treated as near-slave labour. 
The Indian prime minister, Atal Behari Vajpayee, told Mr de Lastic that ""only lunatics can indulge in such acts"". But the government has been reluctant to condemn the lunatics publicly, dismissing the attacks as ""isolated incidents"". Mr Vajpayee is regarded as a moderate, but his government includes fervent Hindu nationalists. Some have links with the Sangh Parivar, whose members may be influential in constituencies the government needs to nurse. 
Mr de Lastic died in a car crash in Poland. The vast congregation at his funeral in Delhi last week included representatives from just about every faith practised in the country. The president and a number of government ministers paid their respects. One said Alan de Lastic was ""a great saint"". For a few hours India experienced religious harmony.

A Hindu-nationalist, India's prime minister, Atal Behari Vajpayee, wants to be remembered not just as the man who flexed his muscles by testing a nuclear bomb, but also as the leader who ushered in the era of information technology. Mr Vajpayee is planning to clear away many of the roadblocks holding up the deregulation of telecoms in India, and with it the growth of the Internet. If he is successful, the wiring of this nation of i billion people will have profound consequences, even for those in some of the remotest villages. 
Mr Vajpayee set out his plans on July i5th while attending a meeting of the chief ministers of India's states in the southern city of Bangalore. This is the heart of the country's flourishing software industry. But concern is growing about the industry's ability to make the transition from being a sweatshop for cheap programming, mostly for foreign companies, to an innovator and major exporter in its own right. Many of the obstacles facing India's budding technology entrepreneurs have been erected by Mr Vajpayee's own ministers and public-sector bosses, each keen to cling to turf and power. 
Proposals to liberalise telecoms have long been opposed by both the labour wing of Mr Vajpayee's party, which runs thecountry's biggest trade union and fears that jobs will be lost, and the cultural wing, which worries that foreigners will end up controlling India's telecoms industry. Now the prime minister feels able to override many of their objections. One reason is that India is falling well behind the rest of Asia in its use of new technologies, such as the Internet, and old ones like the telephone (see chart). 
Mr Vajpayee has found strong allies among some of the chief ministers who are anxious to spur economic growth. From August i5th-India's independence day, and once an occasion for proclaiming its self suF ficiency-long-distance telecoms, formally a public-sector monopoly, will be fully deregulated. India's own telecoms commission had wanted to liberalise only gradually, by allowing just four private operators to bid for licences. But Mr Vajpayee thought the process would be too lengthy and would be plagued by legal challenges. In his view, the aim should be to get the most telephone connections rather than the highest licence fees. Now there will be no limit on the number of licences available. Operators will simply pay the government a fixed fee and a share of their revenue. 
International links will also be opened up. Until now, state-run Videsh Sanchar Nigam has enjoyed monopoly access to undersea cables, which are vital for providing such connections. Mr Vajpayee has ended the monopoly and will allow private Internet service providers to do their own deals with the operators of undersea cables. This could produce a huge increase in capacity, reducing worries that a lack of ""band-width"", a measure of the network's ability to provide more sophisticated services, will strangle India's Internet revolution at birth. 
Dewang Mehta, president of India's National Association of Software and Service Companies, estimates that greater competition for the use of undersea cables will bring the cost of Internet access for companies down by over 50%. But more is needed: many want an optical-fibre backbone to reach every comer of the country. To help create this, Mr Vajpayee and the chief ministers agreed to give unrestricted right of way to companies laying cables along national highways and other major roads. 
The chief ministers also want to. revamp education policy to enourage the rapid expansion of computer skills and allow a much greater role for private colleges. Mr Vajpayee reckons that India already has a good base of technology institutes and regional engineering colleges. He hopes to use them more intensively to double student output within a year and triple it in two. Some chief ministers are also trying to set up new colleges in their states with the help of Indian software billionaires working in America's Silicon Valley. 
Yet some of the chief ministers worry that backward states are being left behind in the information-technology race. To help them, Mr Vajpayee has offered to cut the excise and customs duties on informationtechnology-related equipment to close to zero. The chief ministers say that, for their part, they will waive sales tax. 
Computers, telecoms and the Internet have become all the rage in India, spawning instant millionaires and enthusing politicians everywhere. India's software exports have been growing by 40-5096 a year and were worth almost $4 billion last year. They could amount to $5.7 billion this year. A report by McKinsey, a management consultancy, estimates that India's informationtechnology revenues will be $87 billion by 2008, and the industry will employ z.zm people and export products worth $5o billion. That is more than India's entire merchandise exports today. 
Much of this, however, may benefit only a thin upper crust of Indian society. Far more exciting is the possible use of the Internet to change the lives of hundreds of millions of villagers. In the past, many would sell their produce to traders at whatever price was of fered. Now the telephone and the Internet give them instant information on relative prices in different market towns, greatly improving their bargaining power. 
Villagers also pay hefty bribes to officials to see land records. But the Internet should allow them to download such information instantly and to discover when records have been tampered with. Villagers seeking work abroad sometimes have to pay touts and labour contractors large sums to get a passport. With access to an Internet link, they may be able to download a passport application form and submit it by post. 
Unsurprisingly, state bureaucracies oppose the computerisation of government records because they stand to lose from such openness. Yet the process may now be unstoppable.In some villages, coral-Indian versions of Internet cafes are already springing up. These are telephone booths converted by private operators who charge a small fee for connecting to the Internet. Because power cuts are frequent, many of these entrepreneurs use diesel generators to keep their Internet operations going. 
Chandrababu Naidu, the chief minister of Andhra Pradesh, was among the first to see the potential of the computer. At first, he was jeered by traditional politicians, who felt the computer and the Internet were far too ""elitist"" to win votes. But when Mr Naidu coasted to victory in a state-assembly election last year, politicians all over the country began to take notice. The net has now become part of the political agenda, and Mr Vajpayee wants to exploit it to the full. ","A bold deregulation of the telecoms industry will , with luck , spread the use of the Internet in India and change millions of lives 
 Atal Bihari Vajpayee's , wants to be remembered not just as the man who flexed his muscles by testing a nuclear bomb , but also as the leader who ushered in the era of information technology . Atal Bihari Vajpayee is planning to clear away many of the roadblocks holding up the deregulation of telecoms in India , and with it the growth of the Internet . If Atal Bihari Vajpayee is successful , the wiring of this nation of i billion people will have profound consequences , even for those in some of the remotest villages . 
 Atal Bihari Vajpayee set out Atal Bihari Vajpayee's plans on July i5th while attending a meeting of the chief ministers of India 's states in the southern city of Bangalore . This is the heart of the country 's flourishing software industry . But concern is growing about the industry 's ability to make the transition from being a sweatshop for cheap programming , mostly for foreign companies , to an innovator and major exporter in its own right . Many of the obstacles facing India 's budding technology entrepreneurs have been erected by Atal Bihari Vajpayee's own ministers and public - sector bosses , each keen to cling to turf and power . 
 Proposals to liberalise telecoms have long been opposed by both the labour wing of Atal Bihari Vajpayee's party , which runs thecountry 's biggest trade union and fears that jobs will be lost , and the cultural wing , which worries that foreigners will end up controlling India 's telecoms industry . Now Atal Bihari Vajpayee feels able to override many of their objections . One reason is that India is falling well behind the rest of Asia in its use of new technologies , such as the Internet , and old ones like the telephone ( see chart ) . 
 Atal Bihari Vajpayee has found strong allies among some of the chief ministers who are anxious to spur economic growth . From August i5th - India 's independence day , and once an occasion for proclaiming its self suF ficiency - long - distance telecoms , formally a public - sector monopoly , will be fully deregulated . India 's own telecoms commission had wanted to liberalise only gradually , by allowing just four private operators to bid for licences . But Atal Bihari Vajpayee thought the process would be too lengthy and would be plagued by legal challenges . In Atal Bihari Vajpayee's view , the aim should be to get the most telephone connections rather than the highest licence fees . Now there will be no limit on the number of licences available . Operators will simply pay the government a fixed fee and a share of their revenue . 
 International links will also be opened up . Until now , state - run Videsh Sanchar Nigam has enjoyed monopoly access to undersea cables , which are vital for providing such connections . Atal Bihari Vajpayee has ended the monopoly and will allow private Internet service providers to do their own deals with the operators of undersea cables . This could produce a huge increase in capacity , reducing worries that a lack of "" band - width "" , a measure of the network 's ability to provide more sophisticated services , will strangle India 's Internet revolution at birth . 
 Dewang Mehta , president of India 's National Association of Software and Service Companies , estimates that greater competition for the use of undersea cables will bring the cost of Internet access for companies down by over 50 % . But more is needed : many want an optical - fibre backbone to reach every comer of the country . To help create this , Atal Bihari Vajpayee and the chief ministers agreed to give unrestricted right of way to companies laying cables along national highways and other major roads . 
 The chief ministers also want to . revamp education policy to enourage the rapid expansion of computer skills and allow a much greater role for private colleges . Atal Bihari Vajpayee reckons that India already has a good base of technology institutes and regional engineering colleges . Atal Bihari Vajpayee hopes to use them more intensively to double student output within a year and triple it in two . Some chief ministers are also trying to set up new colleges in their states with the help of Indian software billionaires working in America 's Silicon Valley . 
 Yet some of the chief ministers worry that backward states are being left behind in the information - technology race . To help them , Atal Bihari Vajpayee has offered to cut the excise and customs duties on informationtechnology - related equipment to close to zero .

IT IS interesting, but is it important? On July 24th, Hizbul Mujahideen, a militant group fighting Indian rule in Kashmir, announced a three-month ""unilateral ceasefire"" and of fered talks with the Indian government. India's prime minister, Atal Behari Vajpayee, gave the offer a cautious welcome. Is this merely a tactical ploy by one of more than a dozen anti-Indian militias in Kashmir? Or is it a turning point in a decade-long insurgency that has killed perhaps 30,000 people and keeps India and Pakistan, now both nuclear powers, on the brink of war? 
The proposed truce comes after a series of peaceward lurches, including India's release from jail of several separatist leaders and a proposal by Kashmir's ruling party, an ally of India's governing coalition, for restoration of the state's autonomy. 
Among the throng of guerrilla groups fighting to evict India from its only Muslimmajority state, Hizbul Mujahideen is a heavyweight. It accounts for 1,000 of the estimated 2,500 militants active in Kashmir, guesses Amitabh Mattoo, of Jawaharlal Nehru University in Delhi, and is the only big group dominated by Kashmiri fighters (as distinct from Pakistanis and other foreigners). It has strong political links both to Pakistan and within Kashmir. If India accepts a dialogue with Hizbul Mujahideen, it will be talking to those closest to representing the alienated Kashmiri majority. 
Hizbul Mujahideen has given India few excuses for dodging its offer. Pakistan-sponsored violence was India's main reason for avoiding negotiations with both Pakistan and the separatists. Hizbul Mujahideen's of fer, especially if it is endorsed by Pakistan, makes that harder. The main preconditions seem to be an end to human-rights violations and to violence against Hizbul Mujahideen's guerrillas, and a readiness to allow free political expression by the Kashmiri people. It is unclear whether the group is insisting that Pakistan be a direct party to the talks, an idea anathema to India. 
Other Pakistan-based outfits call Hizbul Mujahideen's offer a betrayal. The United Jihad Council, a grouping of 15 militant organisations, suspended its membership and sacked its leader, Syed Salahuddin, as the council's chairman. Though hardline groups such as Lashkar-e-Taiba and Harkatul Mujahideen have shallower Kashmiri roots than Hizbul Mujahideen, they are thought to be more daring and more lethal. The ceasefire offer brought no immediate cessation of violence. On July 26th the Indian armed forces said it had killed seven ""terrorists"" near the line of control between Indian- and Pakistani-administered Kashmir. 
Less apparent, but perhaps more important, is the attitude of Pakistan's military-led government, probably an important sponsor of the Kashmir insurgency and certainly a beneficiary of it. Pakistan's foreign minister merely said that it is up to Kashmiris to decide ""the manner in which their struggle should be waged."" 
Tacit approval-if that is what this is-- could have several motives. One would be to put India on the spot. Since last year, Pakistan has been in a diplomatic doghouse for trying to conquer territory on India's side of the line of control and risking a wider conflict. Bill Clinton helped force the Pakistanis into a humiliating retreat; India has since refused to talk to them about Kashmir, and basked in international sympathy for its position. Perhaps Pakistan is trying to win back sympathy, and shift to India the onus for resuming dialogue, through Hizbul Mujahideen. If India is forced to talk both to Kashmiris and to Pakistan about Kashmir, Pakistan will have achieved an important aim; if India spurns the bait, it may attract the blame. Even if all sides can agree on a formula for negotiations, it will not be easy for India's security forces to display the humanity and restraint required by a truce, especially a partial one. The truce offer is ""winwin"" for Pakistan, says Mr Mattoo. 
Some Indians hope that Pakistan's ruler, General Pervez Musharraf, is pragmatically giving up the long-standing goal of wresting all of Kashmir from India. If India strikes a deal with the Kashmiri people that keeps Kashmir within India, General Musharraf could claim that they had at last achieved ""self-determination"". Even if that is not his intention, India might be able to work out a deal that would make further resistance to its rule look like the work of foreign fanatics. 
No matter what the reasons, no matter who has approved or disapproved, the ceasefire offer will give a new turn to the insurgency in Kashmir, says Arif Jamal, a Pakistani who is writing a book about jihad (holy war) in Kashmir. It ""will change everything in South Asia."" This is a large claim for a truce offer by just one violent group. The Indian government may be too rigid to respond to it adequately.

DELHI 
TO A warmonger, there is nothing so provoking as the threat of peace. In less than 24 hours, between August ist and znd, more than too people were killed in the Indian state of Kashmir, most of them ordinary Hindus. About 30 pilgrims were killed in one attack, 27 migrant workers in another. It was, said one observer, the ""bloodiest"" day in the decade-long insurgency against India's rule of its only Muslim-majority state. The slaughter came the week after one of the main insurgent groups, Hizbul Mujahideen, had declared a ceasefire and offered talks with the Indian government. 
India's prime minister, Atal Behari Vajpayee, blamed Pakistan, which covets the half of Kashmir that India controls. ""It is clear that...either groups which enjoy Pakistan's protection or militant groups that take instruction from Pakistan have decided to end the peace and kill innocent people,"" he said. Pakistan countered that India itself might be responsible for the attacks. 
The nascent peace process so far survives, but may have grown shakier. Hizbul Mujahideen condemned the attacks. India, promised Mr Vajpayee, would not be ""cowed down by terrorism"". He seems to have backed away from the demand that separatists should swear fealty to the Indian constitution. Meanwhile, talks began. 
Yet the latest violence may be giving Hizbul Mujahideen second thoughts. The group, which is pro-Pakistan, appeared flexible about the insurgents' demand, which India rejects, that Pakistan should be a party to the talks from the start. Yet on August 3rd a spokesman suddenly presented India with an ultimatum: either agree to ""tripartite talks"" (including Pakistan) by August 8th or the ceasefire would be called off. 
Talks will not mean much unless other separatist Kashmiris, represented by the All Party Hurriyat Conference, join in. The 23member umbrella group, which is divided on just about everything except opposition to India, has been cagey. Its newly elected chairman has called the ceasefire declaration ""a hasty step"" and still insists on making Pakistan part of the talks. Whether it softens that position probably depends on the signals it gets from Pakistan itself. 
The assumption until this week's killings had been that Pakistan's military ruler, General Pervez Musharraf, had endorsed Hizbul Mujahideen's ceasefire offer, probably under pressure from the United States and other countries in a position to grant or withhold aid for the beleaguered economy. Despite India's suspicions, that may still be so. In an interview with the sgc on August and, he described the ceasefire as a window of opportunity. The groups responsible for the carnage may be beyond General Musharraf's control. There may be renegade hardliners within his own government. Or perhaps, as India implies, the general is playing a double game, offering peace with one hand while making war with the other. 
India may also be of two minds. Plenty of Kashmiris think that India would rather divide the separatists and rule Kashmir as before than reach a real accord with the disgruntled populace. The Delhi government recently rejected an autonomy plan put forward by the state's elected assembly, which it deems the legitimate representative of the Kashmiri people, even though most Kashmiris do not. That ""enhanced [Kashmiris'] distrust"" of the government's intentions, said Muzaffar Baig, vice-president of the propeace People's Democratic Party. As in Pakistan, the government in India may be split between peacemakers-Mr Vajpayee is thought to be one-and hardliners. 
The warmongers are no doubt hoping that India's security forces will go on a rampage, killing more innocents in the name of punishing those behind the slaughter. Even if they show restraint, they will find it impossible to withdraw from public places and their ubiquitous bunkers, as Hizbul Mujahideen has proposed in the hope of building confidence. The group's ultimatum to India suggests that it may be looking for an excuse to back out of a peace offer that other militants have violently rejected.

AFTER barely a fortnight of frail life, the peace process in Jammu & Kashmir is officially dead. Hizbul Mujahideen, one of the main groups fighting India's rule in its only Muslim-majority state, had on July 24th called a ceasefire and said it would like to talk to the Indian government. Later, it imposed an ultimatum: the talks would have to include Pakistan, which controls a third of Kashmir and regards India's portion as its rightful inheritance, or the ceasefire would be called off India ignored the ultimatum, and on August 8th Hizbul Mujahideen said it would fight on (see page 35). The conflict seems to be back to the same hopeless state in which it has languished for 53 years-except that nowadays, on a whim of either India or Pakistan, it could turn nuclear. 
According to some rumours, Pakistan and India have, despite appearances, already struck a secret deal on the future of Kashmir, making the end of the truce nothing more than a tactical manoeuvre. That seems unlikely, though nothing can be ruled out. Even if the past hopeful fortnight's events turn out to be no more than a feint in the direction of peace, though, they have revealed the contours of how a peace process might evolve. 
First, it should be understood that the stated obstacles to peace are not the real ones. India's prime minister, Atal Behari Vajpayee, dispensed quickly with the main Indian objection to talks with the rebels, who want either independence for Kashmir or union with Pakistan. Though India could not transgress its own constitution, Mr Vajpayee dropped his insistence that the rebels had to accept it as a condition for talks. India should deal with them on the basis of insaniyat (humanity), he said. The speed and flexibility of his response to the ceasefire gave the rebels little excuse for backing out. 
Nonetheless, Hizbul Mujahideen found one, in the form of a demand that Pakistan had to be party to the talks. India rejected that for two reasons. First, it regards Pakistan as the author of violence in Kashmir, whether it was last year's harebrained attempt to grab territory on India's side of the line of control or last week's horrible series of massacres in which over ioo people died. More profoundly, India regards Kashmir as its territory and the discontent of the Kashmiris as an internal matter. Even so, dual talks could have been embarked upon, perhaps by treating them as separate processes. 
The real hurdles to peace are, first, India's bumbling and brutal treatment of a people who have never been certain whether they belonged with India, Pakistan or on their own; and, second, Pakistan's stake in their discontent. While it lasted, the ceasefire offered a glimpse of a way over the first hurdle. India would have started by talking to Hizbul Mujahideen, which, unlike most of the other militant groups, is dominated by Kashmiris rather than outsiders. The talks would have gradually been extended to take in other separatist groups, including at least some of the 23 members of the All-Party Hurriyat Conference. Eventually, they would have encompassed all shades of opinion in the state. Such talks would get nowhere, however, without tangible improvements in India's administration of Kashmir. 
Each stretch of the track would add strain. The state's ruling party, despised by most Kashmiri Muslims, has no wish to make way for pacified militants. Mr Vajpayee's own party, the Hindu-nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party, is ideologically disinclined to make the sort of concessions that might pacify them. Sooner or later, these issues must be faced. 
The massacre and the ultimatum suggest that Pakistan, or groups over which Pakistan's government has some influence, can veto any move towards peace and has strong reason to. But India has, in essence, everything else it wants. Though India formally claims all of Kashmir, including the areas now controlled by Pakistan and China, it would probably settle for the status quo, turning the present line of control into the international border. Pakistan thinks, probably wrongly, that violence can force India to grant Kashmir ""self-determination"". Pakistan's incentive to disrupt any truce is like that of a gunslinger in a poker game who knows he holds low cards. 
The way forward 
Outsiders can help blunt that incentive. In March Bill Clinton, stopping briefly in Pakistan on his way home from India, declared that ""this era does not reward people who struggle in vain to redraw borders with blood:' It is widely believed that behind the scenes America has been cajoling Pakistan to restrain the militants. It had been hoping that the country's military ruler, General Pervez Musharraf, was desperate enough for economic aid to comply. Hizbul Mujahideen's ceasefire proposal looked like the fruit of that pressure. 
Although the truce has broken down, progress need not come to a halt. India should continue with its peace offensive, preaching and practising insaniyat. That means talking to willing Kashmiris, restoring democratic decency to the state and allowing its citizens to be architects of their own future. India will not be chided for refusing tripartite talks at the point of a gun, but it cannot forever dodge talking to Pakistan about Kashmir. At some stage, Mr Vajpayee and General Musharraf will have to meet. Pakistan and Hizbul Mujahideen will have to return to the negotiating table, leaving their guns at the door. They may not win back the rest of Kashmir. But a durable peace that ended the threat of nuclear war would be quite a consolation prize.

That seems unlikely , though nothing can be ruled out . Even if the past hopeful fortnight 's events turn out to be no more than a feint in the direction of peace , though , they have revealed the contours of how a peace process might evolve . 
 First , it should be understood that the stated obstacles to peace are not the real ones . Atal Bihari Vajpayee's , dispensed quickly with the main Indian objection to talks with the rebels , who want either independence for Kashmir or union with Pakistan . Though India could not transgress its own constitution , Atal Bihari Vajpayee dropped Atal Bihari Vajpayee's insistence that the rebels had to accept it as a condition for talks . India should deal with them on the basis of insaniyat ( humanity ) , Atal Bihari Vajpayee said . The speed and flexibility of Atal Bihari Vajpayee's response to the ceasefire gave the rebels little excuse for backing out . 
 Nonetheless , Hizbul Mujahideen found one , in the form of a demand that Pakistan had to be party to the talks . India rejected that for two reasons . First , it regards Pakistan as the author of violence in Kashmir , whether it was last year 's harebrained attempt to grab territory on India 's side of the line of control or last week 's horrible series of massacres in which over ioo people died . More profoundly , India regards Kashmir as its territory and the discontent of the Kashmiris as an internal matter . Even so , dual talks could have been embarked upon , perhaps by treating them as separate processes . 
 The real hurdles to peace are , first , India 's bumbling and brutal treatment of a people who have never been certain whether they belonged with India , Pakistan or on their own ; and , second , Pakistan 's stake in their discontent . While it lasted , the ceasefire offered a glimpse of a way over the first hurdle . India would have started by talking to Hizbul Mujahideen , which , unlike most of the other militant groups , is dominated by Kashmiris rather than outsiders . The talks would have gradually been extended to take in other separatist groups , including at least some of the 23 members of the All - Party Hurriyat Conference . Eventually , they would have encompassed all shades of opinion in the state . Such talks would get nowhere , however , without tangible improvements in India 's administration of Kashmir . 
 Each stretch of the track would add strain . The state 's ruling party , despised by most Kashmiri Muslims , has no wish to make way for pacified militants . Atal Bihari Vajpayee's own party , the Hindu - nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party , is ideologically disinclined to make the sort of concessions that might pacify them . Sooner or later , these issues must be faced . 
 The massacre and the ultimatum suggest that Pakistan , or groups over which Pakistan 's government has some influence , can veto any move towards peace and has strong reason to . But India has , in essence , everything else it wants . Though India formally claims all of Kashmir , including the areas now controlled by Pakistan and China , it would probably settle for the status quo , turning the present line of control into the international border . Pakistan thinks , probably wrongly , that violence can force India to grant Kashmir "" self - determination "" . Pakistan 's incentive to disrupt any truce is like that of a gunslinger in a poker game who knows he holds low cards . 
 The way forward 
 Outsiders can help blunt that incentive . In March Bill Clinton , stopping briefly in Pakistan on his way home from India , declared that "" this era does not reward people who struggle in vain to redraw borders with blood : ' It is widely believed that behind the scenes America has been cajoling Pakistan to restrain the militants . It had been hoping that the country 's military ruler , General Pervez Musharraf , was desperate enough for economic aid to comply . Hizbul Mujahideen 's ceasefire proposal looked like the fruit of that pressure . 
 Although the truce has broken down , progress need not come to a halt . India should continue with its peace offensive , preaching and practising insaniyat . That means talking to willing Kashmiris , restoring democratic decency to the state and allowing its citizens to be architects of their own future . India will not be chided for refusing tripartite talks at the point of a gun , but it can not forever dodge talking to Pakistan about Kashmir . At some stage , Atal Bihari Vajpayee and General Musharraf will have to meet . Pakistan and Hizbul Mujahideen will have to return to the negotiating table , leaving their guns at the door . They may not win back the rest of Kashmir . But a durable peace that ended the threat of nuclear war would be quite a consolation prize .",750,India,A29-8257,IN TERM,True,"India 's prime minister , Atal Behari Vajpayee",7,True

IT IS the second failed peace initiative for India and Pakistan within 18 months. In February 1999 India's prime minister, Atal Behari Vajpayee, visited his Pakistani counterpart and agreed to resolve the two countries' disputes peacefully. That effort collapsed a few months later, when India discovered that Pakistani forces had occupied positions on its side of the line of control. That line divides into Indian and Pakistani zones the state of Jammu & Kashmir, the main source of tension between them. 
The second initiative entailed, at least at first, India talking directly to Indian Kashmiris, most of whom want independence or union with Pakistan. It began on July a4th when Hizbul Mujahideen, one of the main groups fighting Indian rule in Kashmir, announced a unilateral ceasefire and proposed talks with the Indian government. It was the first significant truce in a decade-long insurgency in which some 30,000 people have died. It did not stop the slaughter last week of over ioo Indians, presumably by opponents of the fledgling peace process. 
The truce ended, apparently, on August 8th, after Hizbul Mujahideen imposed-and India ignored-a belated ultimatum: accept Pakistan as a direct party to the talks or forget about the ceasefire. ""India has dilly-dallied in giving peace a chance,"" said the group's leader, Syed Salahuddin, in Pakistan's capital, Islamabad. Hizbul Mujahideen resumed hostilities at once, claiming to have killed is Indian soldiers at an army camp south of Srinagar, Kashmir's summer capital. Police said there were no casualties. A bomb killed nine people and injured 25 more in Srinagar on August loth. Initially, no group claimed responsibility for the blast. 
The fault is more likely to lie on Mr Salahuddin's side of the border. India had responded with uncharacteristic alacrity to the ceasefire. Its officials had met guerrillas in Srinagar, to talk about ground rules for the ceasefire. Mr Vajpayee made clear that he did not expect the separatists to pledge loyalty to India (though he insisted that India would not break its own constitution). Had talks brought tranquillity, India could not have wriggled out of talking to Pakistan directly. The demand for immediate tripartite talks was never going to be met. It had the look of a stratagem for backing out. 
The culprit, India believes, is Pakistan. It was widely regarded as the instigator, or at least as a supporter, of the ceasefire, perhaps as a way to win political credit from America and other countries dismayed by Pakistan's military regime and its support for violence in Kashmir. Pakistan may have had second thoughts when it looked as if the peace process might actually lead somewhere. 
From Pakistan's point of view, no peace process that excludes Pakistan is legitimate. India's attempt to strike a separate deal with one militant group among many thus deserved to fail. ""India thought it could divide the militant camp,"" said Khalid Mahmud, of the Institute of Regional Studies in Islamabad. ""They were sadly mistaken."" 
But the abortive truce seems to have deepened India's resolve to treat its dispute with Pakistan and its argument with the Kashmiris as two separate issues. After last week's killings-in which some of the victims may have died from stray Indian bullets-and the abandonment of the proposed talks, India will be doubly reluctant to consent to a meeting between Mr Vajpayee and Pervez Musharraf, Pakistan's military ruler, at next month's meeting of the uN General Assembly. It refuses to talk to Pakistan until violence in Kashmir and anti-Indian propaganda subside. 
At the same time, India is keen to find Kashmiri partners to replace the now-frosty Hizbul Mujahideen. India had hoped that the group's Kashmir-based members would continue to observe the ceasefire that their leaders in Pakistan had repudiated. In vain, suggests the group's assault on an army installation. But the search for moderates will continue. India's home minister, L.K. Advani, told Parliament that ""India will not deviate from its chosen course of talks with all those in Kashmir who eschew the path of terror and violence."" 
If India couples this with better administration and more democracy in a state where democratic and human rights are routinely flouted, the short-lived peace initiative may have done some good. But it has also shown that peace initiatives are unlikely to get far without Pakistan's co-operation. And unless India-improbably-reconsiders its basic position that its portion of Kashmir will remain an integral part of its territory, Pakistan will have little incentive to co-operate. 
So the world will continue to have reason to tremble at the confrontation between its two newest nuclear powers. According to a report in the New York Times this week, a secret assessment by American intelligence agencies put the chance of conventional war between India and Pakistan at 50:50 after Pakistan's venture into Indian Kashmir last year. The risk has no doubt declined since then, thanks partly to both overt and discreet diplomacy by America and other countries. The short ceasefire means that it is still too high for comfort, especially since the possibility remains that a war might not stay conventional but go nuclear.

""WE HAVE a big bomb now,"" boasted Atal Behari Vajpayee, India's prime minister, shortly after his government tested five nuclear devices in May 1998. With a fresh but shaky mandate from parliamentary elections, Mr Vajpayee blundered into proclaiming India's nuclear status from motives that mixed political calculation with a fear of China, India's nuclear-armed neighbour, and a feeling that India should not be denied the prestige enjoyed by the five declared nuclear powers. 
He has since danced skilfully away from the diplomatic mess created by the tests. Relations with China, briefly rent, have been mostly mended. An incursion by Pakistan into Indian territory last year, followed by a military coup, have helped persuade the world that India is the saner of the battling pair. The United States deplored India's tests, but after reciprocal visits by Bill Clinton and Mr Vajpayee relations are better than they have been in decades. The bomb lobby can argue that its strategy has worked. 
Yet there is now a dilemma. The hard-won goodwill depends partly on India's keeping a low nuclear profile that threatens neither its neighbours nor international efforts to stop the spread of nuclear weapons. India is being harangued by doves at home, and anti-proliferators abroad, who insist that any further development of its nuclear arsenal would weaken, not strengthen, its security. It would anger China, and goad Pakistan, which answered India's tests with its own, to escalate its nuclear buildup. 
Yet India's desire for a deterrent that could survive a first strike and worry China argues for more and bigger nuclear weapons deployed in potentially risky ways. The murkiness of India's nuclear programme makes either choice look possible. ""South Asia is at a nuclear crossroads,"" according to Samina Ahmed, an authority on Asian security at Harvard University. 
It is also the world's likeliest venue for a nuclear war. India and Pakistan have fought three full-scale wars and came close to fighting a fourth last year, when Pakistan-backed forces occupied territory on India's side of the ""line of control"" in the disputed state of Kashmir. Pakistan hinted that it would use its bomb if India crossed into its territory, a threat it repeats with indecent frequency. India put its nuclear forces on alert, according to a recent study. The perils of enmity are compounded by relative proximity and correspondingly abbreviated warnings of any nuclear attack, by India's refusal to talk to Pakistan and by both countries' inexperience in handling nuclear weapons. 
These risks will be heightened if India and Pakistan move beyond the small, lowtech deterrents they are thought to possess now to larger, dispersed forces that could be launched at short notice on missiles as well as by aircraft. The more fully deployed the weapons are, say analysts, the more vulnerable they are to theft or launch by accident or in panic. For such reasons, writes Gregory Jones of RAND, a think-tank in California, America's ""policy to try to stop nuclear weaponisation in India and Pakistan is eminently sensible."" 
India's answer is a mix of reassurance, obfuscation and drift. The two pillars of its policy are a pledge not to be first to use nuclear weapons against any country, and a commitment to a ""minimum credible deterrent"", which could inflict unacceptable damage on any country that strikes first. Much of the edifice, though, is missing or invisible. A body called the National Security Advisory Board published a sketchy draft nuclear doctrine in August 1999, which proposed that India become capable of launching nuclear weapons by land, sea and air. The government has neither accepted nor rejected it. 
A more authoritative statement came from the foreign minister, Jaswant Singh, who told The Hindu newspaper in November 1999 that India would not keep its weapons on hair-trigger alert, though he suggested that they would be dispersed and made mobile to improve their chances of surviving a first strike. India does not need the same number of nuclear warheads as potential nuclear aggressors have, he said, nor a ""triad"" (aircraft, missiles plus submarines or ships) to launch them. 
So far, so reassuring. But India gives the impression that behind such generalities lies not confidentiality but confusion. This is partly because India has done little to upgrade its policymaking structure since becoming a declared nuclear power. 
The National Security Council (Nsc), a body of top ministers formed in April 1999 to plan long-range strategy, has never met; its secretariat consists of the top intelligence-assessment agency, which continues to fulfil that function. The national-security adviser, Brajesh Mishra, doubles as Mr Vajpayee's top aide. K. Subrahmanyam, convenor of the National Security Advisory Board, describes the Nsc as ""stillborn"". If so, then nuclear policymaking may well remain an affair between a few top politicians and the nuclearscience establishment, uninformed by wider security considerations. 
What little is known about command and control, a devilishly complex function that involves everything from who is authorised to push the nuclear button to the telecommunications networks by which his orders are transmitted, does not inspire confidence. Mr Vajpayee's knee surgery last month put out of commission temporarily the one person known to be authorised to launch India's nuclear weapons. 
Indian strategic thinkers retort that the doctrine of no first use answers many of these concerns. Since India would use nuclear weapons only after being attacked, it would have time to assess whether it has actually been the victim of a nuclear attack and to prepare a response. 
Even if India is being prudent, it must do more to convince others, particularly Pakistan. For the moment, India refuses to talk to Pakistan until it ceases ""cross-border terrorism"" in Kashmir. That is understandable, but it means that no one is discussing the sort of confidence-building measures that could lessen the danger that one side might misinterpret action by the other as hostile. There is now ""such an extreme form of opacity that either side has to assume the worst,"" says Scott Sagan, co-director of Stanford University's Centre for International Security and Co-operation. 
There are hints, perhaps, of a thaw. ""Track 2 diplomacy"" (between ex-officials and non-officials) is under way, and India's defence minister, George Fernandes, says that Pakistan's recent decision to back an Indian non-proliferation initiative at the United Nations ""indicates a possibility of discussions"" there. 
The tenor of any accord with Pakistan could depend on the nuclear face India turns to China. This is the biggest mystery. India lost a war to China in 1962 but still holds some territory that China claims, and viceversa. Part of India's proclaimed reason for testing nuclear weapons was to stand up to the region's superpower. Yet Indo-Chinese relations have been improving, and India may fear that nuclear deployment is more likely to provoke China than deter it. 
India may also lack the means. Some analysts contradict its claim that it successfully tested a hydrogen bomb powerful enough to flatten Chinese cities, and question whether India yet has the expertise to load a bomb on to a missile, the only way to threaten China seriously. India's government refutes this scepticism. Its moratorium on further nuclear testing is based on the belief that it has enough data to build H-bombs and nucleartipped missiles. Mr Fernandes says that the medium-range Agni 2, the main means of delivering a nuclear warhead to China, is ""due for testing"". 
Perhaps, though, the confusion surrounding India's nuclear programme is a sign that it has chosen the studied ambiguities of diplomacy over the uncertain benefits of an advanced deterrent. India will ""do everything short of saying our nuclear programme has stopped,"" says V. R. Raghavan, a former director of military operations who now heads the Delhi Policy Group. If true, India's bomb may not be much bigger than it was before it shocked the world by testing. But India, and the world, could be safer.

Last year's peacemaking journey by India's prime minister, Atal Behari Vajpayee, to Lahore in Pakistan was one such; India's economic reforms are studded with Vajpayan promises. And now Mr Vajpayee has made what looks like a characteristic gesture on Kashmir, the Muslim-majority state over which India and Pakistan tussle: a unilateral ceasefire in India's war against separatist guerrillas during the forthcoming holy month of Ramadan. Western powers, thought to have applied pressure for such an offer, have applauded. 
The last time there was talk of truces and negotiations was in the summer, when one of the main militant groups, Hizbul Mujahideen, surprised the world by offering a unilateral ceasefire. That initiative died when Hizbul demanded that Pakistan be party to any talks. India, which regards dialogue with separatists as an internal matter and accuses Pakistan of promoting insurgency in Kashmir, refused. Kashmir returned to its routine of carnage, in which perhaps 30,000 people have died over the past dozen years. Is there any reason to hope for better this time? 
The truce has drawn mixed reviews. Hardline militant groups, based in Pakistan and mostly manned by non-Kashmiris, rejected the truce outright. Pakistan reacted with suspicion, saying the truce ""could be part of India's effort to impose a military solution."" To prove it is not, India would have to end repression. On November zest five people from a lorry convoy were murdered in Kashmir, a sign, perhaps, of the militants' disdain for the offer. 
Groups with deeper roots in Kashmir, caught between their obligations to ordinary Kashmiris and their dependence on and fear of Pakistan, were more cautious. The AllParty Hurriyat Conference, composed of some two dozen separatist groups that are themselves divided over the role of the gun and over whether Kashmir should be independent or part of Pakistan, had prevaricated during the last peace move. This time it is trying to sound more welcoming. Mr Vajpayee's offer shows a ""positive change"" in India's attitude, said a spokesman. To make it work, Hurriyat leaders would have to talk to Pakistan and to leaders of armed groups. Hizbul Mujahideen, which is preponderantly Kashmiri, said it would welcome the ceasefire, but still insists that India acknowledge that Kashmir is a ""disputed"" territory and that the dialogue include Pakistan as well as the Kashmiri people. 
Whether the proposed ceasefire leads anywhere this time depends on whether differences that are reconcilable in theory can be overcome in fact. India removed one obstacle last summer, by dropping its insistence that the separatists accept the Indian constitution at the outset of talks. The stickiest issue now is the role of Pakistan, which administers a large chunk of Kashmir and backs insurgency on India's side of the state. India has spurned dialogue with Pakistan since its abortive attempt last year to grab territory in Kashmir on India's side of the ""line of control"". So frosty is India's attitude that it recently blocked an Indian cricket tour of Pakistan. Separatists and their Pakistani patrons insist on ""tripartite"" talks, including Kashmiris, India and Pakistan. 
The stalemate could be breakable. Mr Vajpayee promised in Lahore to discuss Kashmir with Pakistan; the promise holds, says India, if Pakistan ends ""cross-border terrorism"". A ceasefire, if widely observed, should help do just that. If dialogue begins separately with Kashmiri rebels and with Pakistan, it is not beyond the wit of diplomats to bring the two tracks together eventually, giving the talks the ""tripartite"" character that India's foes seek. 
The problem is that each side sees in small concessions the seeds of ultimate defeat. To Pakistan, suspending insurgency seems tantamount to relinquishing its claim over Kashmir. To India, allowing Pakistan any role in determining the state's future is a short step from granting that claim. ""Triangular engagement [on Kashmir] is out of the question,"" says a spokesman of India's foreign ministry. Pakistan suspects that Mr Vajpayee's offer is nothing more than a ploy to divide Kashmiris and co-opt the more pliable ones. India thinks that Pakistan's armed forces, which run the country, can justify their privileges only by waging their futile war over Kashmir. 
If peace is to advance, both sides will have to be proved wrong. India will have to find a way of talking to Pakistan about Kashmir without believing that means surrendering it. Pakistan will have to decide that the risks of war outweigh those of peace. ","IF THE adjective "" Vajpayan "" were in the dictionary , it would describe gestures that arouse hopes but then recede without quite disappearing , sometimes through no fault of their author 's . Last year 's peacemaking journey by Atal Bihari Vajpayee's , to Lahore in Pakistan was one such ; India 's economic reforms are studded with Vajpayan promises . And now Atal Bihari Vajpayee has made what looks like a characteristic gesture on Kashmir , the Muslim - majority state over which India and Pakistan tussle : a unilateral ceasefire in India 's war against separatist guerrillas during the forthcoming holy month of Ramadan . Western powers , thought to have applied pressure for such an offer , have applauded . 
 The last time there was talk of truces and negotiations was in the summer , when one of the main militant groups , Hizbul Mujahideen , surprised the world by offering a unilateral ceasefire . That initiative died when Hizbul demanded that Pakistan be party to any talks . India , which regards dialogue with separatists as an internal matter and accuses Pakistan of promoting insurgency in Kashmir , refused . Kashmir returned to its routine of carnage , in which perhaps 30,000 people have died over the past dozen years . Is there any reason to hope for better this time ? 
 The truce has drawn mixed reviews . Hardline militant groups , based in Pakistan and mostly manned by non - Kashmiris , rejected the truce outright . Pakistan reacted with suspicion , saying the truce "" could be part of India 's effort to impose a military solution . "" To prove it is not , India would have to end repression . On November zest five people from a lorry convoy were murdered in Kashmir , a sign , perhaps , of the militants ' disdain for the offer . 
 Groups with deeper roots in Kashmir , caught between their obligations to ordinary Kashmiris and their dependence on and fear of Pakistan , were more cautious . The AllParty Hurriyat Conference , composed of some two dozen separatist groups that are themselves divided over the role of the gun and over whether Kashmir should be independent or part of Pakistan , had prevaricated during the last peace move . This time it is trying to sound more welcoming . Atal Bihari Vajpayee's offer shows a "" positive change "" in India 's attitude , said a spokesman . To make it work , Hurriyat leaders would have to talk to Pakistan and to leaders of armed groups . Hizbul Mujahideen , which is preponderantly Kashmiri , said it would welcome the ceasefire , but still insists that India acknowledge that Kashmir is a "" disputed "" territory and that the dialogue include Pakistan as well as the Kashmiri people . 
 Whether the proposed ceasefire leads anywhere this time depends on whether differences that are reconcilable in theory can be overcome in fact . India removed one obstacle last summer , by dropping its insistence that the separatists accept the Indian constitution at the outset of talks . The stickiest issue now is the role of Pakistan , which administers a large chunk of Kashmir and backs insurgency on India 's side of the state . India has spurned dialogue with Pakistan since its abortive attempt last year to grab territory in Kashmir on India 's side of the "" line of control "" . So frosty is India 's attitude that it recently blocked an Indian cricket tour of Pakistan . Separatists and their Pakistani patrons insist on "" tripartite "" talks , including Kashmiris , India and Pakistan . 
 The stalemate could be breakable . Atal Bihari Vajpayee promised in Lahore to discuss Kashmir with Pakistan ; the promise holds , says India , if Pakistan ends "" cross - border terrorism "" .

DELHI 
As A country, India is famous for its contrasts, and its economy is showing that trait in spades. In some quarters the mood is almost panicky. A wave of cheap goods from China is said to be coursing through Indian markets, depressing industrialists and worrying the government. They are bracing themselves for another flood after next March, when India removes the last quantitative restrictions on imports (mostly of consumer and agricultural goods) at the behest of the World Trade Organisation. Import anxiety is said to be largely responsible for an investment drought in manufacturing. Agriculture, the source of livelihood for most of India's people, is expected to perform indifferently after a spotty monsoon. 
Yet plenty of countries would be happy with India's indicators. Economic growth, even after a series of downgrades by forecasters, is expected to be little short of 6% in the current fiscal year. Reserves are enough to cover most of a year's imports. Despite the surge in oil prices, the current-account deficit is expected to be less than 2% Of GDP. Exports, even to dread China, are booming. 
Few people think this is good enough: not stockmarket investors, who have seen share prices fall 20% this year; not industrialists, who are suffering from sluggish domestic demand; and not the government. The prime minister, Atal Behari Vajpayee, has set a cracking growth target of 8%, the minimum needed to reduce poverty at a reasonable pace and to make India an economic player to be reckoned with. China, India's only slightly bigger neighbour, pulls in more than ten times the foreign investment and exports more than five times the merchandise. To get near such targets, India needs to reform further. 
Amit Mitra, secretary-general of the Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce and Industry, points to six burdens that weigh more heavily on Indian companies than on their competitors: the cost of power, which is ""two to three times higher"" than elsewhere; the cost of borrowing; red tape and the corruption that goes with it; onerous sales and local taxes; slow and expensive transport; and inflexible labour markets. Correcting these and a few other deficiencies constitutes much of the government's programme for reform. The impression is that it has promised much, but delivered little. 
Sometimes the government does not get much credit for its accomplishments. Recently, and with little fanfare, it ended its policy of reserving garment manufacturing to small firms, freeing them to grow to a more competitive size. With the Chinese and others challenging Indian toy makers and locksmiths, it may not be long before these industries too are freed from size restrictions. over the past several months, India has largely liberalised its telecoms market, which should speed its emergence as an information-technology power. After last year's opening up of the insurance market, the first private players are appearing. 
The government wants people to believe that the pace is accelerating. ""Major disinvestment lie, privatisation] is around the corner,"" says N.K. Singh, the prime minister's top economic adviser. But the government so far has raised virtually none of the $2 billion it planned from privatisation this fiscal year, though it is still promising to sell a dozen companies, including a state-owned airline. Privatisation would have the triple virtue of reducing the government's debt, attracting foreign investment and making the companies more competitive. 
India needs rapidly to upgrade its infrastructure, both because snarls cost the economy an estimated $12 billion a year and because spending on highways would create jobs and boost growth. But here too the promises exceed the current reality. The government says that contracts to build 2,500 km (1,500 miles) of road will be awarded by March. 
In other areas of concern to Mr Mitra and his members, the government is still dithering. It wants labour markets to work better, but dare not provoke street action by stripping workers of their job security. It recognises that India's combined central and state government deficits-which amount to more than a tenth of GDP-are unsustainable. Yet, even though it plans to introduce a spending-trimming ""fiscal responsibility"" bill, the government is unlikely to make a serious dent in the deficit this year. Its plan for privatising banks is a muddle: it envisages the government stake falling to 33%, but would permit no private investor a stake of more than 1%. 
A reason for urgency is that industry, weary of waiting for its six burdens to be lightened, may begin to push for protection. The panic about Chinese imports is overdone. Imports besides gold and oil fell in the first half of the fiscal year-and (non-smuggled) imports from China account for less than 3% of India's total anyway. Yet the government has raised tariffs on some items and begun a series of anti-dumping investigations. When the last quantitative restrictions fall away next year, industry is hoping for high tariffs to replace them. Omar Abdullah, minister of state for commerce, says the government is resolved to ""bring down the average level of tariffs"". But, he adds that, after a half-century of protection, ""industry needs a bit of breathing space."" ","India's economy

THE month of Ramadan is half over, and with it India's temporary ceasefire in Kashmir and Pakistan's counteroffer of ""maximum restraint"" along the ""line of control"", the de facto border there.

Honour might be satisfied on all sides if Pakistan were to do so at the invitation of the Kashmiris, once a permanent ceasefire had been negotiated between India and Kashmir's political and military groups. Vagueness is all: if both India and Pakistan do not bolt the details down too rigidly, a glimmer of hope would appear for the start of a Kashmiri ""peace process""-not the same thing as peace, but a step away from war.

Too many false dawns have broken over the Vale of Kashmir for optimism to be unconfined, but one happy coincidence is that the leaders of both India and Pakistan now have the means and the motive to move a little further towards such a peace process. The means come from their political positions at home. General Musharraf, as the army chief of staff who organised Pakistan's incursion into Indian Kashmir last year, has an unimpeachable record in most militants' eyes. More than any civilian politician, he now has the ability to take on the wilder-eyed among those militants, many of whom are not Kashmiris at all, and tilt his support towards the moderates. He has already quietly promoted at least seven likeminded generals over the heads of others with closer ties to the most intransigent terrorist groups. 
Atal Behari Vajpayee, India's prime minister, also has the means to explore concessions. He leads a coalition that is proving more robust than most recent Indian governments and, as a lifelong member of the Hindu-nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party, his credentials look pretty solid too. His inflammatory remarks last week over the disputed religious site at Ayodhya (see page 44) may well have been a sop to militant Hindus to prepare them for movement on Kashmir. Mr Vajpayee has cunningly neutralised his own firebrands, winning their approval for his Kashmir diplomacy. 
As for the motives, these are driven by foreign policy. After Bill Clinton's visit in March, which marked the beginning of an end to decades of antagonism between the world's most powerful country and its largest democracy, India looks ever more securely committed to opening itself up to the world, modernising its economy and taking up the place as a great power to which it aspires. It can do none of those things while pursuing a grisly war in Kashmir, and none without America's support, which will depend on progress there. Pakistan looks rather the opposite: an isolated dictatorship with not much of a future at all unless it can rebuild its once-close relations with the West. But by making a historic shift over Kashmir, the general could buff up his image quite a bit. To encourage him in these thoughts, America last week got the imF to extend a much-needed loan to Pakistan. 
No one should expect rapid solutions from peace talks over Kashmir, which, under a formula still being discussed, could start before year's end. But the mere existence of a peace process can be an end in itself, at least for a while. Carefully managed, this one might bring a cessation of violence, if not lasting harmony, for months, or even years. ","India and Pakistan have both made concessions , but still must make more

IN THE past, thaws in relations between India and Pakistan have usually portended avalanches rather than spring. Yet the chances for at least starting talks about the disputed state of Kashmir-such talks to encompass India, Pakistan and separatists from the part of the state ruled by India-are the best they have been in nearly two years. 
In December India's prime minister, Atal Behari Vajpayee, extended until January 26th the unilateral ceasefire in operations against armed separatists in Kashmir that he started in Ramadan, the Muslim holy month. A delegation from the All-Party Hurriyat Conference, the main political grouping of separatists, may soon be allowed to go to Pakistan to obtain the blessings of its government and (less likely) of militant groups based there, most of which oppose a peace process. Talks between the Hurriyat and the Indian government could begin soon after that. ""We shall be bold and innovative designers of a future architecture of peace and prosperity,"" declared Mr Vajpayee in a newspaper article he wrote during his winter holiday in the backwaters of Kerala. 
Pakistan has answered in kind: on December 20th it withdrew some of its troops from the ""line of control"", the unofficial border that divides Kashmir into Indian- and Pakistani-controlled zones. Pervez Musharraf, Pakistan's military ruler, has softened his country's earlier insistence that it should be party to any negotiations from the outset. India rejects ""tripartite"" talks because it regards Kashmiri separatism as an internal matter. Pakistan now says that talks can begin between the Indian government and the Hurriyat; Pakistan can join later. This is a ""shift in Pakistan's focus"", says Khalid Mahmud of the Institute of Regional Studies in Islamabad. ""Kashmiris occupy centre stage for the first time."" 
In Kashmir, there is some relief. The security forces have been ordered to strike only after being struck, and shelling across the border has declined. Roadblocks and cordon-and-search operations, the bane of daily life, have been reduced. Hope is stirring for an end to the violence. 
But the peace process could yet collapse before it gets going. Pakistan-based militant groups, especially those dominated by non-- Kashmiris, are trying to make that happen, with attacks on Indian security forces and others, one of them at the Red Fort in Delhi, where independent India raised its flag for the first time in 1947. Mr Vajpayee says that Pakistan cannot talk to India until it does more to rein in ""terrorist organisations"". The Hurriyat's trip to Pakistan, due in mid-January, is being complicated by Indian hesitation about giving passports to all seven of its leaders, including pro-Pakistan hardliners. Kashmir's pro-Indian state government meanwhile says it will hold local elections this month, an attempt, say the separatists, to scuttle the peace process. 
What makes these obstacles surmountable is that the three main participants want the process to begin. India is keen to talk to disgruntled Kashmiris, and recognises it cannot get far without the co-operation of Pakistan. The Hurriyat, though divided over issues such as whether merger with Pakistan is preferable to independence, is eager for a political solution after years of fruitless war. And Pakistan, internationally reviled for its military government and its failed attempt in 1999 to seize territory on India's side of the line of control, would regard dialogue with India about Kashmir as a diplomatic coup. 
But none of this necessarily means that thinking has changed enough to keep talks going once started, let alone to produce a settlement to a dispute that has brought about two wars and a 12-year insurgency involving some 35,000 deaths. Observers in India and Pakistan doubt that their governments have shed the inhibitions that have stymied any settlement for half a century. Amitabh Mattoo, a scholar at Jawaharlal Nehru University in Delhi, thinks that the most India can offer Kashmir is ""full autonomy"" within India; Pakistan, India hopes, will settle for the portion of Kashmir it already controls. But, says Mr Mahmud in Islamabad, Pakistan's willingness to let the Hurriyat talk to India is ""based on the assumption that Kashmiri leaders will not settle for autonomy."" 
This clash over final results could matter soon, because it bears on how the talks will be structured. The longer India talks separately to Kashmiris and to Pakistanis, the better its odds of striking a deal with the former and presenting it as a fait accompli to the latter. The sooner the two tracks are brought together, the bigger the say Pakistan will have in the final disposition of Kashmir. 
Both sides have powerful reasons to hold fast to their traditional positions. India, which has had to battle many other separatist movements, never stops worrying about its ""territorial integrity"" and about what would happen to its 130m Muslims if the only Muslim-majority state were allowed to secede. Many in Mr Vajpayee's party regret that Kashmir has been given more autonomy than other states, since they fear this may represent a precedent. 
For its part, Pakistan's army owes its privileged position to strife with India. Even if General Musharraf is willing to give that up, he is vulnerable to charges of treachery by Islamic zealots, many of whom are armed and who have friends in the army. The leader of one prominent group recently called him a ""security risk"" to Pakistan. 
The next few weeks may disclose whether inhibitions can be broken. Mansoor Ijaz, a New York-based financier who has helped facilitate the peace process, says that General Musharraf is ""assembling a team of like-minded generals"" who believe that the Kashmiri freedom movement has been hijacked by Islamic fundamentalists. Their backing could help General Musharraf to be flexible. India's foreign minister is expected soon to visit Saudi Arabia, source of much of the money on which the most implacable militants depend. An understanding between the two governments could curb the flow of funds. 
If the zealots are tamed, a formula might be found that gives Kashmiris some form of ""self-determination"", credits Pakistan with a victory on their behalf and preserves India's territorial integrity. India now seems keen to improve the lives of ordinary Kashmiris. The question is whether it can do the same for one worried Pakistani general. ","India and Pakistan are moving towards historic talks on Kashmir . But the hard part is just beginning 
 IN THE past , thaws in relations between India and Pakistan have usually portended avalanches rather than spring . Yet the chances for at least starting talks about the disputed state of Kashmir - such talks to encompass India , Pakistan and separatists from the part of the state ruled by India - are the best they have been in nearly two years . 
 In December Atal Bihari Vajpayee's , extended until January 26th the unilateral ceasefire in operations against armed separatists in Kashmir that Atal Bihari Vajpayee started in Ramadan , the Muslim holy month . A delegation from the All - Party Hurriyat Conference , the main political grouping of separatists , may soon be allowed to go to Pakistan to obtain the blessings of its government and ( less likely ) of militant groups based there , most of which oppose a peace process . Talks between the Hurriyat and the Indian government could begin soon after that . "" We shall be bold and innovative designers of a future architecture of peace and prosperity , "" declared Atal Bihari Vajpayee in a newspaper article Atal Bihari Vajpayee wrote during Atal Bihari Vajpayee's winter holiday in the backwaters of Kerala . 
 Pakistan has answered in kind : on December 20th it withdrew some of its troops from the "" line of control "" , the unofficial border that divides Kashmir into Indian- and Pakistani - controlled zones . Pervez Musharraf , Pakistan 's military ruler , has softened his country 's earlier insistence that it should be party to any negotiations from the outset . India rejects "" tripartite "" talks because it regards Kashmiri separatism as an internal matter . Pakistan now says that talks can begin between the Indian government and the Hurriyat ; Pakistan can join later . This is a "" shift in Pakistan 's focus "" , says Khalid Mahmud of the Institute of Regional Studies in Islamabad . "" Kashmiris occupy centre stage for the first time . "" 
 In Kashmir , there is some relief . The security forces have been ordered to strike only after being struck , and shelling across the border has declined . Roadblocks and cordon - and - search operations , the bane of daily life , have been reduced . Hope is stirring for an end to the violence . 
 But the peace process could yet collapse before it gets going . Pakistan - based militant groups , especially those dominated by non-- Kashmiris , are trying to make that happen , with attacks on Indian security forces and others , one of them at the Red Fort in Delhi , where independent India raised its flag for the first time in 1947 . Atal Bihari Vajpayee says that Pakistan can not talk to India until it does more to rein in "" terrorist organisations "" . The Hurriyat 's trip to Pakistan , due in mid - January , is being complicated by Indian hesitation about giving passports to all seven of its leaders , including pro - Pakistan hardliners . Kashmir 's pro - Indian state government meanwhile says it will hold local elections this month , an attempt , say the separatists , to scuttle the peace process . 
 What makes these obstacles surmountable is that the three main participants want the process to begin . India is keen to talk to disgruntled Kashmiris , and recognises it can not get far without the co - operation of Pakistan . The Hurriyat , though divided over issues such as whether merger with Pakistan is preferable to independence , is eager for a political solution after years of fruitless war . And Pakistan , internationally reviled for its military government and its failed attempt in 1999 to seize territory on India 's side of the line of control , would regard dialogue with India about Kashmir as a diplomatic coup .

DELHI 
INDIA has received little thanks for suspending offensive operations against militants in the part of Kashmir it rules. Since the prime minister, Atal Behari Vajpayee, announced a unilateral ceasefire in late November, to coincide with the Muslim holy month of Ramadan, Pakistan-based militant groups have kept up their war, attacking an airport, buses and other targets. Government sources say they have used the lull in operations against them to rearm and to kill suspected informers. Nonetheless, India decided this week to extend by a further month the unrequited ceasefire, which was due to end on January 26th. 
Its decision keeps alive hopes of talks between the government and the two groups most opposed to its rule: Kashmiri separatists, as represented by the All-Party Hurriyat Conference, and Pakistan, which has backed their cause. But a formula for starting formal negotiations with the Hurriyat has so far eluded India. A Hurriyat team was supposed to visit Pakistan in mid-January to get the blessing of its government and of militant groups for starting a peace process. But India has so far failed to issue passports to all five delegates the Hurriyat wants to send. India's main worry seems to be that Syed Ali Shah Geelani, a pro-Pakistan hardliner on the proposed delegation, will steal the show in Pakistan, pushing the moderates into the wings. 
The Hurriyat is angry. Atrocities and harassment by security forces, mainly the ones controlled locally rather than by the central government, are rising after a respite, claims Yasin Malik, a Hurriyat leader who favours independence rather than union with Pakistan. Moderates in the Hurriyat want Mr Geelani to get his passport. They may not trust him, but they like even less the idea of the Indian government splitting the separatist coalition. 
Rather than stalking out of the bazaar, the two sides are at least still haggling. Mr Malik and some other Hurriyat leaders have welcomed the extension of the ceasefire. Mr Vajpayee seems genuinely keen to talk to the moderates, though other members of his government may be less so. Both parties seem to agree that they cannot jettison hardliners like Mr Geelani, however little they like their views. 
Without Pakistan's co-operation, though, talks between India and the Hurriyat will not get far. India had hoped that Pakistan would respond to its ceasefire by curbing militancy in the Muslim-majority state. That has not happened. Firing across the ""line of control"", the unofficial border that divides Kashmir into zones administered by India and by Pakistan, has diminished after a pull-back of Pakistani troops in December. But violence within Kashmir has remained high. According to official figures from the state, there were 467 incidents in the 55 days before the ceasefire and 456 during the same period afterwards. The number of ""terrorists"" and security forces killed has fallen, but the number of explosions, suicide attacks and civilians killed (including politicians and informers) is up. As it renewed the ceasefire India said that Pakistan ""continues to promote, encourage and abet cross-border terrorism"". It refuses to talk directly to Pakistan about Kashmir until it thinks that support has been curtailed. And India's recent test of its Agni II missile, capable of carrying nuclear warheads, may provoke a copycat test by Pakistan. 
Pakistan's implacability stems from its fear that India's goal is to strike a deal with the Hurriyat, probably giving Kashmir autonomy within India, and force Pakistan to accept it. For peace, India must either convince Pakistan that its fear is unfounded or reconcile Pakistan to the consequences. ","Kashmir

""THE sort of devastation you might expect from a nuclear explosion,"" was one rescue worker's description of what an earthquake had done to parts of the western state of Gujarat on January 26th. The disaster has stunned a country already too well acquainted with natural furies. About 25,000 people died, guesses the state's government; others fear as many as 100,000 could still be lying under the rubble. The United Nations thinks that 60-80% of the 5m people living in Kutch, a largely barren district bordering Pakistan where the quake had its epicentre, and in the five surrounding districts, are ""highly affected"" by the quake. Estimates of the economic cost to one of India's richest and most industrialised states are also colossal and vague: the state's chamber of commerce put property damage at 250 billion rupees (about $5.5 billion) and production losses at 4.5 billion rupees a day. Even on the more conservative estimates, the earthquake is independent India's worst disaster. 
Help is coming. Teams from Britain, Russia, Turkey and elsewhere joined the Indian armed forces in searching for survivors, and celebrated the few they were able to pull out of the rubble. Money, manpower and material are coming from the central government, multilateral bodies such as the World Bank, dozens of foreign governments and NGOs and Gujarat's prosperous business houses. A plane-load of medicines, blankets and tents arrived from Pakistan, India's longstanding antagonist, which India accepted with as much grace as it could muster. A militant group opposed to Indian rule in Kashmir offered ioo pints of blood. Volunteers are bringing in cars full of food. 
The scale of the disaster has muffled, though not silenced, the usual criticism of officialdom. ""All officials are themselves victims,"" points out one foreign helper. It is ""quite remarkable that so many have shown such fortitude."" 
Along with heroism, there is chaos. Supplies are piling up at the airport in Bhuj, the district capital, where there are too few lorries to transport them and too little information to direct them to where they are most needed. Relief agencies say that the hardesthit towns, such as Bhuj, are getting help while outlying villages are being neglected. Four days after the event, small villages just ten kilometres (six miles) from Bhuj had not been reached, says an official of Oxfam, a British-based charity. Some have received rice but no water for cooking it. Relief lorries are being looted by desperate villagers. 
This is happening in part because there is not enough co-ordination among the agencies that have so commendably rushed to help. These include not only the state government, which has the main responsibility for disaster relief, but also foreign and local NGOS, each with its own ideas. The director of one NGo based in Ahmedabad, the commercial capital, says he knows of ""more than four coordinating mechanisms"". ""Everybody is just confused right now,"" says Namrata Bali, of the Self-Employed Women's Association, which has sent teams to help 200,000 members who have been affected. 
The confusion may now begin to clear as the United Nations' Office for the Co-ordination of Humanitarian Affairs, which many NGos expect to co-ordinate the work of non-government agencies, finishes assessing the damage. Attention is now shifting from rescuing people to keeping them healthy, providing shelter and restoring their shattered livelihoods. 
What happens before disaster strikes and long after journalists have forgotten it matters even more than rescue and relief. No one will ever know how many people were killed by shoddily constructed buildings allowed by lax inspectors and inadequate building codes, but the suspicion is that the number is high. Two years ago India's urban-development ministry published a report calling for states to upgrade building codes and promote the strengthening of existing buildings. Almost all state governments ignored it. Experts lament that neither the central government nor most states have agencies dedicated to disaster planning. The agriculture ministry handles disasters for the central government, an arrangement born of the view that farmers and the food supply are most at risk after catastrophes. 
The Gujarat calamity has prompted the usual introspection. The prime minister, Atal Behari Vajpayee, has said he will set upa national disaster agency. Legislation is in the works to encourage states to improve planning and prevention. But the usual fate of such ideas is that they die once the emergency passes, or are ignored even if they survive the journey from proposal to policy. 
Neglect can also halt recovery from disasters. CARE, an International NGo, had wanted to build 5,ooo-io,ooo houses for victims of a cyclone that struck the eastern state of Orissa in November 1999, but has money enough only for 1,400. Its chief in India, Tom Alcedo, guesses that CARE can afford to build only a fifth of the planned i,ooo cyclone shelters, which were to double as schools. ""Funding has all but dried up for Orissa,"" he says. 
The same will happen with the even greater tragedy in Gujarat without the attention of government, the tenacity of private charities and the generosity of donors. it took a minute to destroy Kutch. It will take years to rebuild it-safely. ","The effects of the most destructive earthquake in independent India 's history were made worse by human shortcomings

In announcing a third extension on February 22nd the prime minister, Atal Behari Vajpayee, spiced it up, extending it by three months rather than just one. That should give diplomacy more time to work. At the same time, he gave warning that militant groups flagrantly disregarding the ceasefire would not be spared.
 The peace initiative needs a new twist. It began promisingly in November, with India suspending offensive operations against militants fighting its rule of the mainly Muslim state. Pakistan in turn withdrew troops from the line of control, the unofficial border between the zones run by the rival countries.
 Violence subsided appreciably. In the past couple of months, though, it has mounted again, while diplomacy has stalled. Attacks on Indians, in and out of uniform, by pro-Pakistan guerrillas have not abated. They were widely blamed for the killing of 15 civilians, including seven children, on February 10th. To Kashmiris, India's ceasefire is beginning to appear a mere abstraction. When protesters demonstrated on February 15th against the killing of a suspected militant, said to be in police custody, India's army opened fire, killing five of them.
 The incident prompted curfews, more protests and more killings. By extending the ceasefire, this time with explicit backing from most political parties, India is playing to two galleries: international opinion, which has applauded it, and moderate members of the separatist All-Party Hurriyat Conference, whom India sees as the likeliest partners for peace on terms it can accept. Another less amenable audience is Pakistan, which has helped to keep peace along the line of control.
 As the past few months have shown, not much more can happen without further co-operation from Pakistan and from some militant groups it influences, if not controls. The main idea for getting that was to let a Hurriyat team visit Pakistan. That was supposed to happen in mid-January, but India has so far failed to issue passports to all five members of the delegation. Its fear is that the visit will become an occasion for bashing India and promoting Pakistan's claim to Kashmir.
 India is particularly concerned about the role of Syed Ali Shah Geelani, a pro-Pakistan hardliner who regards the Kashmiri cause more as a religious jihad than a political one. Hurriyat moderates also are keen to keep him in check. India has not yet decided that the Hurriyat is tame enough to go, nor has it managed to initiate talks without the trip.
 The Indian government thinks the ceasefire alone should have reduced export of violence from Pakistan. General Pervez Musharraf, Pakistan's military ruler, has hinted at a willingness to curb radicalism. If peace is to progress, one side or the other will have to make more than a gesture.

 FATALISM is ever present in India, and the government in Delhi seems to be hoping that a popular belief in the inevitability of corruption will help it survive the biggest scandal of recent times. That hope seems well founded. But whether the government will regain the authority it needs to pursue its two main initiatives--economic reform and peace in Kashmir--is much more doubtful.
 The uproar over the release of videotapes last week showing top politicians and officials taking bribes from two Internet news reporters posing as arms dealers has reached a noisy impasse. The defence minister, George Fernandes, has resigned, though he remains ""convener"" of the 18-party ruling National Democratic Alliance. The NDA has lost one member, the Trinamul Congress party of West Bengal, but remains sure enough of its majority to dare the opposition to bring a no-confidence vote in Parliament. The opposition, equally sure of its minority, has declined. Instead, it has blocked parliamentary proceedings for a week, relenting long enough only to allow money to be voted for the state to continue functioning.
 Both sides have converted an occasion for shame into one for self- righteousness. Sonia Gandhi, leader of a suddenly alert Congress party, vowed at its plenary meeting in Bangalore to ""wage every war"" to ""ensure that this country is liberated from the shackles of this corrupt, shameful and communal government"". But she herself was wounded when her own personal assistant came under investigation in a separate scandal. The prime minister, Atal Bihari Vajpayee, has blended penitence with defensiveness. He has promised a judicial probe into the allegations, and a clean-up. But, in a television address on March 16th, Mr Vajpayee reserved the word ""criminal"" to describe the hurling of allegations, not the behaviour alleged.
 It is true that tehelka.com, the enterprising website that armed its reporters with cash and spy cameras, used surreptitious means to persuade a variety of officials, generals and politicians to accept a total of 1.1m rupees (about $24,000) in bribes and gifts. It is also true that some of the most serious allegations made against Mr Fernandes and Brajesh Mishra, the prime minister's top aide, among others, are unsubstantiated gossip. But they have concentrated discussion on how many more heads will roll and when.
 The real import of the tapes is the evidence they give that corruption is the norm, not the exception, at every level of public life. This does not surprise Indians, who are expected to bribe everyone, starting with traffic policemen. India is beset by what some call a crisis of governance, which compromises nearly every public service, from defence to the distribution of subsidised food to the generation of electricity. Tehelka.com has simply rubbed Indians' faces in it.
 Politicians, in honest moments, admit this. Kapil Sibal, a prominent member of Congress, says ""the system is thoroughly corrupt."" Pramod Mahajan, the minister of information technology and a member of Mr Vajpayee's Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), thinks the voters face a choice ""not between good and bad. It is between bad and worse.""
 With turpitude so common, removing one group of parties from power would not solve the problem. Given a chance to fight political corruption, Parliament usually ducks it. It now wants to shear the Central Vigilance Commission, the main body implementing anti- corruption law, of its role overseeing investigations of politicians.
 The problem begins, says N. Vittal, the central vigilance commissioner, with the 40% of the economy that is unaccounted for. Indian democracy runs on this murky money. The total cost of a campaign for a parliamentary election has been estimated at 20 billion rupees (around $430m), which is often paid for by undeclared donations of the sort proffered by tehelka.com. Reformers such as Mr Vittal want such donations to be declared and made tax deductible. Some also want the Election Commission to give the voters information about candidates' criminal backgrounds, as Delhi's High Court has directed. But that reform may also be stopped: the government has appealed against the decision. No one in power seems to back the promised cleansing.
 Mr Vajpayee's immediate concern is the fate of his closest advisers, widely resented for accumulating power in the prime minister's office at the expense of other ministries. On March 19th, Mr Mishra and N.K. Singh, his top economic adviser, called a press conference to defend themselves against claims that they had improperly influenced decisions on deals in telecoms, power and, in Mr Mishra's case, defence equipment. Pressure for their dismissal, from some of Mr Vajpayee's best friends, is mounting. A fiercely right-wing ally of the BJP, the Shiv Sena, is calling for their heads. And although the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (Association of National Volunteers), ideological big brother to the BJP, has withdrawn its calls for their removal, it has done so only for fear of destabilising the government.
 The departure of Mr Mishra and Mr Singh would probably blunt the government's drive for economic reform. Even if they stay, Mr Vajpayee will have trouble enacting the most controversial but valuable elements of the reforms announced along with the budget last month. These include privatisation and making labour law more flexible. The labour reform requires the approval of Parliament's upper house, where the government lacks a majority. The crisis may also strengthen the home ministry, thought to be more reluctant than the prime minister's advisers to make gestures to separatists in Kashmir. If Mr Vajpayee survives the tehelka scandal, he may begin to ask himself what, exactly, he is in power for.","  Though it may well survive the latest corruption scandal , the authority of the leading party in the government is badly dented

 PRESSED by reporters this week to say something that would make a headline, Krishna Chandra Pant, India's new peacemaker for Kashmir, was characteristically cautious. ""Dialogue"", he said, ""is a process, not an event."" So, no quick fix for the 53-year-old Kashmir dispute, the cause of two of India's three wars with Pakistan. Not that anyone was expecting a quick fix, and it does no harm to keep expectations realistic. Mr Pant will try to bring peace, but it will be a long haul.
 Mr Pant was drafted in by the Indian government on April 5th to try to inject some semblance of activity into a peace effort that has made little real progress since last November when Atal Behari Vajpayee, the prime minister, announced a unilateral ceasefire in the government's campaign against militants in the mainly-Muslim state of Jammu & Kashmir. In December, Pakistan pulled troops back from the ""line of control"", the de facto border between Indian Kashmir and Pakistani Kashmir. That helped to ease tension. It brought peace to the border near Kargil, where a battle had taken place between the two countries in 1999 and thereby alerted the world to the risks of another war over Kashmir, this time possibly involving nuclear weapons.
 But elsewhere in Kashmir there has been anything but peace. General Pervez Musharraf, Pakistan's military ruler, last week even called the ceasefire a hoax. That was a strange accusation: Pakistan- supported guerrillas, especially the Lashkar-e-Tayiba, have continued to attack Indian police posts and other government installations, sparking clashes with Indian security forces. Nearly 400 civilians and 200 security officers have been killed since last November.
 For a start, Mr Pant will aim to talk quietly to the main groups in Kashmir, militant and non-militant, and presumably to Pakistan through informal diplomacy, probably at first though intermediaries. He can discuss any aspect of the dispute. But he will be aware of India's determination not to cede sovereignty over Kashmir--though it is probably willing to agree eventually to a form of regional autonomy.
 Mr Pant, who is 69, is one of those respected politicians talked of as a possible prime minister but then ruled out as being too much of a cautious gentleman to make it to the very top of India's rough politics. Over the past 34 years, Mr Pant has held a variety of senior government jobs and has a reputation for quietly achieving results. In the 1980s, he was defence minister in a Congress government, and helped to deal with regional conflicts in north-east India.
 Now he has become a sort of patrician workhorse for Mr Vajpayee's coalition, which, having never held office till it came to power in 1998, is short of experienced elders. He was briefly involved in work for the Congress party in Kashmir nearly 20 years ago, when Indira Gandhi was prime minister, but has had no direct involvement in the state since separatist violence developed in the early 1990s. That may be no bad thing.
 It has to be said that the Indian government gave Mr Pant a rocky start. A statement announcing his appointment annoyed the Kashmir- based All-Party Hurriyat Conference, which comprises more than 20 groups that refuse to recognise India's sovereignty over Kashmir but are divided over the use of violence. The Hurriyat is India's most likely partner in any peace talks, but it refuses to sit down with other Kashmiri groups that tacitly or openly recognise Indian sovereignty. The statement said it hoped that the Hurriyat's participation would be unconditional. But the Hurriyat wants to send delegates to Pakistan before any talks, and has been waiting since January for the necessary Indian passports.
 The statement upset Pakistan by repeating India's insistence that talks between the two countries depended on Pakistan curbing cross- border terrorism and putting an end to anti-India propaganda. Pakistan also wants to be included in any talks with India and the Hurriyat, a proposal India at present rejects. The statement may have said nothing new, but its reception shows how sensitive is anything connected with Kashmir.
 So where does Mr Pant begin? Obviously, with the Hurriyat. It plans to meet this weekend to discuss its stance. If Mr Pant can persuade the group to say some constructive things about the need for talks with the Indian government, he should then get India to issue the much-delayed passports. The most difficult decision will be whether to give one to Syed Ali Shah Geelani, a pro-Pakistan hardliner whom India would like to exclude. But whether Mr Geelani goes or not, India will be faced with what, from its point of view, will be infuriating anti-Indian propaganda during the visit.
 The hope is that, behind the scenes, the Hurriyat would sell the idea of curbing the violence to General Musharraf and to leaders of guerrilla groups such as the Hizbul Mujahideen, which declared a short-lived ceasefire last July. Pakistan could help by endorsing India's wish to talk about soft confidence-building issues such as trade and visas. Mr Musharraf opposed this approach in an interview with India's Asian Age newspaper last week, saying that unless Kashmir was dealt with directly, all other activity would be futile.
 If things move on, Mr Pant could urge the parties to begin with what might be called triangular talks. That would involve three sets of bilateral talks between India, Pakistan and the Hurriyat, thus avoiding India having to sit down jointly with both Pakistan and the Hurriyat. In addition, Mr Pant would have to find a way of making representatives of other groups feel involved, without alienating the main participants. Only later might everyone come together round one table. That, pundits say, might be several years away. But it might at least be a period without the prospect of war.","  India 's new move to end tension in a dispute that has lasted for 53 years

 MAY 10th was a good day for India's opposition parties. Congress, the main foe of the ruling national coalition, unseated local governments in Assam and Kerala. It now controls 12 of 35 states and territories. Jayaram Jayalalitha, a former actress, trounced the government of Tamil Nadu, proving that a corruption conviction need not dim charisma. The Communists will extend their rule of West Bengal to nearly 30 years after winning their sixth straight election there. These parties could, conceivably, gang up on the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), which heads the 17-member National Democratic Alliance (NDA) that runs the country at the national level.
 But will they? No BJP government was up for re-election in the five states, including tiny Pondicherry. Only in Tamil Nadu did a government led by a member of the Alliance face the voters (who were not very happy with it). Yet the NDA may now even add to its majority. Disgruntled MPs from the party of the defeated challenger in West Bengal may be ready to defect to the ruling coalition, which need not face an election until 2004. Even so, for the time being at least, only one party is big enough on its own to bring down the government, the Telegu Desam Party of Andhra Pradesh. But it has good reason not to do so, since that would mean backing Congress, its main rival for power in the state, or facing new national elections.
 The opposition, too, has reason to be circumspect. In 1999 it prematurely toppled a BJP-led government, prompting new elections-- and defeat for the topplers. And many elements of the opposition oppose each other. Although they share a ""secular"" ideology (whereas the BJP is Hindu-nationalist), Congress and the constituents of the centre-left People's Front are rivals for power at state level. Congress and the Communists fought in West Bengal and Kerala. In Uttar Pradesh, the biggest state, Congress is a feeble competitor for the anti-BJP vote.
 Victories in Assam and Kerala have heartened Congress, and quietened talk that its Italian-born leader, Sonia Gandhi, is neither a politician nor an Indian. But in a by-election at the same time, Congress lost one of its few parliamentary seats in the northern state of Uttar Pradesh. The party remains less than a juggernaut.
 And though the elections were not exactly a referendum on the BJP- led government in Delhi, they were a humiliation for it. The prime minister, Atal Behari Vajpayee, campaigned for the ruling parties in Tamil Nadu and Assam, but he evidently did them no good. The BJP performed dismally in states where it fought on its own, winning no seats in Kerala and West Bengal. In Uttar Pradesh the BJP is the ruling party, but in the by-election there it came fourth, a bad omen for the party for next year's state election.
 The election rebuff has knocked the BJP. The party may now lack the courage to move quickly on economic reform, which requires controversial measures, such as liberalising labour laws. Suspicions of corruption have hung over the party since March, when journalists secretly filmed leaders of the BJP and its allies taking money in exchange for help in selling fictitious armaments to the government. The BJP is unlikely to win back support, or be bold, as long as its izzat--Urdu for honour--is draining away.","  Voters in state elections bolster parties outside the national coalition

 IT IS an odd sort of peace initiative that begins with the cancellation of a truce. Yet India's decision on May 23rd to end its six-month unilateral ceasefire against the militants fighting its rule in Kashmir while inviting Pakistan's military ruler for talks could be the best news the region has had in a while. Talks between India's government and the Kashmiri separatists had been going nowhere, partly because Pakistan did not want them to. Enlisting Pakistan to seek peace was the only other option. For the first time since declaring themselves to be nuclear powers, India and Pakistan may be about to discuss their differences seriously.
 India's reversal of policy is dramatic. Its prime minister, Atal Behari Vajpayee, had initiated civilities in February 1999 when he took a bus from Delhi to Lahore, capital of Pakistani Punjab, and embraced his Pakistani counterpart of the day, Nawaz Sharif. The two promised in the Lahore Declaration to resolve their differences peacefully. A few months later India cried betrayal: it discovered that Pakistani troops had seized territory near the town of Kargil on its side of the ""line of control"", which divides Kashmir into zones controlled by Pakistan and India.
 In the mini-war that followed, India ejected Pakistan from its part of Kashmir. It has since refused to talk directly to Pakistan as long as it backed militancy in the state. In October 1999 Pakistan's army chief, Pervez Musharraf, ousted Mr Sharif in a coup. Since India regarded General Musharraf as the mastermind of the invasion, this deepened India's resolve.
 Instead, Mr Vajpayee tried to make peace directly with disgruntled Kashmiris, in the hope that Pakistan could eventually be persuaded to accept the deal. The unilateral ceasefire began promisingly in November, with Pakistan reciprocating by pulling troops back from the line of control. But India failed to tempt the All-Party Hurriyat Conference, the main political grouping of separatists, into talks. Militancy continued unabated and Kashmiris accused Indian security forces of unrelenting brutality.
 With few people mourning the expired ceasefire, Mr Vajpayee is trying to de-emphasise the role of the separatists and move Pakistan to centre stage. He may not have forgiven or forgotten Kargil, but he has decided to finesse it.
 For General Musharraf, Mr Vajpayee's invitation is a triumph. He had long been lobbying for talks, and seemed to regard India's rebuff as an insult to both Pakistan and the legitimacy of his government. Pakistan's standing in the West seemed to reach a new low earlier this month, when the American deputy secretary of state, on a visit to India, came close to calling it a rogue state. Mr Vajpayee's invitation has promoted General Musharraf from pariah to potential participant.
 The new initiative could progress further than the last one, if only because, presumably, Pakistan will not stupidly repeat its prank of seizing Indian-controlled territory while pretending to talk peace. But it is not clear yet whether either side is prepared to concede enough to make it more than a temporary respite.
 India will repeat its demand that General Musharraf should do what he can to stop ""cross-border terrorism"". But at least it does not seem to expect that all violence will end immediately. A spokesman for India's foreign ministry says that India has ""decided to address the issue of terrorism through the security forces"", implying that low-level fighting will go on. Six Muslim militants were shot by Indian forces the day after the ceasefire ended. But an end to violence is no longer a precondition of dialogue but an objective of it. This suggests that General Musharraf will have at least a little time to deal with the anti-Indian militant groups based in Pakistan, which are the most implacable foes of compromise. One, Lashkar-e- Taiba, has reportedly dismissed India's invitation as a ""gimmick"".
 But General Musharraf will pay a price for India's relenting. Mr Vajpayee has in effect turned the clock back to February 1999, when Kashmir was just one of several subjects on a broader agenda for improving Indo-Pakistani relations. General Musharraf may now have to accept what he seemed to reject two years ago: negotiations that do not hold relations with India hostage to developments in Kashmir. This would be good news for the region. Kashmir is by far the most intractable dispute between the two countries, but nuclear confrontation is the gravest danger.
 It is not clear whether talks will work in practice. India's resumption of offensive operations against militant groups in Kashmir risks making a bad human-rights situation worse, despite the foreign ministry's promise that its security forces would take ""maximum care"" to shield civilians from harassment.

 Mr Vajpayee's invitation to General Musharraf has given Pakistan some of what it wants, but it may not be enough. India's formal position remains that Kashmir (including the Pakistan-controlled part) is an integral part of its territory, though most observers think it might agree to divide the state along the line of control. India's notion of dialogue on Kashmir is discussing ways to reduce militancy, whereas Pakistan champions ""self-determination"" for the Kashmiris, in other words Kashmir's accession to Pakistan. Peace requires a quick compromise between these seemingly irreconcilable positions or, more likely, a productive delay.","  India ends its ceasefire , but calls for talks with Pakistan 's leader 
  IT IS an odd sort of peace initiative that begins with the cancellation of a truce . Yet India 's decision on May 23rd to end its six - month unilateral ceasefire against the militants fighting its rule in Kashmir while inviting Pakistan 's military ruler for talks could be the best news the region has had in a while . Talks between India 's government and the Kashmiri separatists had been going nowhere , partly because Pakistan did not want them to . Enlisting Pakistan to seek peace was the only other option . For the first time since declaring themselves to be nuclear powers , India and Pakistan may be about to discuss their differences seriously . 
  India 's reversal of policy is dramatic . Atal Bihari Vajpayee's , had initiated civilities in February 1999 when Atal Bihari Vajpayee took a bus from Delhi to Lahore , capital of Pakistani Punjab , and embraced Atal Bihari Vajpayee's Pakistani counterpart of the day , Nawaz Sharif . The two promised in the Lahore Declaration to resolve their differences peacefully . A few months later India cried betrayal : it discovered that Pakistani troops had seized territory near the town of Kargil on its side of the "" line of control "" , which divides Kashmir into zones controlled by Pakistan and India . 
  In the mini - war that followed , India ejected Pakistan from its part of Kashmir . It has since refused to talk directly to Pakistan as long as it backed militancy in the state . In October 1999 Pakistan 's army chief , Pervez Musharraf , ousted Mr Sharif in a coup . Since India regarded General Musharraf as the mastermind of the invasion , this deepened India 's resolve . 
  Instead , Atal Bihari Vajpayee tried to make peace directly with disgruntled Kashmiris , in the hope that Pakistan could eventually be persuaded to accept the deal . The unilateral ceasefire began promisingly in November , with Pakistan reciprocating by pulling troops back from the line of control . But India failed to tempt the All - Party Hurriyat Conference , the main political grouping of separatists , into talks . Militancy continued unabated and Kashmiris accused Indian security forces of unrelenting brutality . 
  With few people mourning the expired ceasefire , Atal Bihari Vajpayee is trying to de - emphasise the role of the separatists and move Pakistan to centre stage . Atal Bihari Vajpayee may not have forgiven or forgotten Kargil , but Atal Bihari Vajpayee has decided to finesse it . 
  For General Musharraf , Atal Bihari Vajpayee's invitation is a triumph . He had long been lobbying for talks , and seemed to regard India 's rebuff as an insult to both Pakistan and the legitimacy of his government . Pakistan 's standing in the West seemed to reach a new low earlier this month , when the American deputy secretary of state , on a visit to India , came close to calling it a rogue state . Atal Bihari Vajpayee's invitation has promoted General Musharraf from pariah to potential participant . 
  The new initiative could progress further than the last one , if only because , presumably , Pakistan will not stupidly repeat its prank of seizing Indian - controlled territory while pretending to talk peace . But it is not clear yet whether either side is prepared to concede enough to make it more than a temporary respite . 
  India will repeat its demand that General Musharraf should do what he can to stop "" cross - border terrorism "" . But at least it does not seem to expect that all violence will end immediately . A spokesman for India 's foreign ministry says that India has "" decided to address the issue of terrorism through the security forces "" , implying that low - level fighting will go on . Six Muslim militants were shot by Indian forces the day after the ceasefire ended . But an end to violence is no longer a precondition of dialogue but an objective of it . This suggests that General Musharraf will have at least a little time to deal with the anti - Indian militant groups based in Pakistan , which are the most implacable foes of compromise . One , Lashkar - e- Taiba , has reportedly dismissed India 's invitation as a "" gimmick "" . 
  But General Musharraf will pay a price for India 's relenting . Atal Bihari Vajpayee has in effect turned the clock back to February 1999 , when Kashmir was just one of several subjects on a broader agenda for improving Indo - Pakistani relations . General Musharraf may now have to accept what he seemed to reject two years ago : negotiations that do not hold relations with India hostage to developments in Kashmir . This would be good news for the region . Kashmir is by far the most intractable dispute between the two countries , but nuclear confrontation is the gravest danger . 
  It is not clear whether talks will work in practice . India 's resumption of offensive operations against militant groups in Kashmir risks making a bad human - rights situation worse , despite the foreign ministry 's promise that its security forces would take "" maximum care "" to shield civilians from harassment . Mirwaiz Umar Farooq , a Hurriyat leader , claims that they have killed 13 people in custody in the past week , while the ceasefire was still nominally in effect . India 's offer of talks to "" all sections "" in Kashmir remains open . But the separatists will now take their cue from Pakistan .

 YOU do not have to spend much time at the offices of Biocon, a biotechnology firm on the outskirts of Bangalore, to learn a thing or two about the state of India today. A few minutes inside is long enough to ascertain that Biocon is state-of-the-art, part of a high- tech boom that has appeared to lift India above the level of an impoverished third-world giant. Yet a glance at the frenetic construction site outside, hiving with human activity, tells you that although Biocon may be thriving, India remains poor. The rubble is shifted not by bulldozers but by the sari-clad women seen all over India who carry it in baskets on their heads.
 A second glance, however, tells another story. In place of the customary coil of cloth on their heads, these rubble bearers are wearing yellow helmets, a rare precaution in a country that is normally unfussy about safety, especially that of the poor. And what stops the baskets from sliding down the smooth yellow domes? The sort of innovation that emerges from India's mish-mash of eras: each helmet is crowned with a little platform that will steady a rubble- filled basket.
 How Indians interpret scenes like that at Biocon's building site matters to their future. If you ignore the helmets, you might conclude that India's decision, ten years ago this summer, to abandon economic planning and open up to global markets had enriched the privileged but left the poor as wretched as ever. This view is influential. One distinguished commentator, speaking probably for the bulk of India's intellectuals and do-gooders, called Bangalore's high- tech high-flyers ""secessionist"". People who share this view-or merely exploit it-have succeeded in slowing reform to a fitful stagger.
 But the yellow hats imply that they are wrong. The forces pulling India into the global economy, they suggest, are also drawing poor Indians away from the margins and into jobs in which niceties like occupational safety matter. If that is so, politicians who obstruct reform in the name of the poor are repressing them as effectively as any landowner or loan shark.
 If this were blindingly obvious, Indian democracy would dispose of leaders who block liberalisation and install a new set who promote it. But in India, where a river can be a goddess, a laundry and a toilet all at once, nothing is obvious. The country has states such as Gujarat and Maharashtra, which during the past ten years have been growing at the rate of Asian ""tiger"" economies in their better days; but it also has Bihar, with a population the size of Germany's and living standards on a par with Burundi's. Even within Gujarat, the ""golden corridor"" abuts some of the country's poorest areas. India can supply an example of any extreme, and convince you it is the whole story.
 Seekers after economic truth usually turn to numbers, but even India's statistics are less clear-cut than they might be. Recent figures showing that poverty fell sharply during the 1990s were celebrated by advocates of reform-and just as fiercely contested by its opponents. The country's official statistics are subject to frequent and unexpected revisions. India's variety and vagueness conspire to frustrate anyone who tries to be objective in charting the effects of economic reforms over the past decade. The place is all subplot and no plot.
 Happy ending?
 This survey will attempt to trace an unfolding plot and script a happy ending. At first sight, economic reform may seem to have added yet another set of contradictions. In fact, it has launched India in the direction most Indians want to see it go: towards more widely shared prosperity and a position of influence in the world. The momentum is not irreversible, and the new direction raises its own problems: environmental, cultural and social, to name three sorts. These problems are grave, but none of them is an excuse for keeping a billion people poor. The bigger danger is that India will lose the plot by failing to push forward what it began back in 1991.
 When it embarked on reform, the government of the day (formed by the Congress party, now in opposition) threw out 44 years of dogma. It abolished industrial licensing, which told entrepreneurs how much of a particular good they could manufacture and encouraged them to do it badly; it lowered trade barriers, which discouraged India from buying almost anything from or selling to the rest of the world; and it devalued the rupee.
 On most measures, the reform was a triumphant success. Economic growth, after a brief wobble, picked up, making India one of the world's fastest-growing economies in the 1990s. Foreign direct investment rose from next to nothing to well over $2 billion a year (see table 2). India's share of world exports of goods, which had fallen from 2% at independence to 0.4% in 1980, climbed to 0.7% in 2000.
 Having faced the prospect of default on its external debt in 1991, the country has now accumulated $40 billion of foreign-exchange reserves, enough to cover nine months' imports. Consumer-price inflation fell from 14% in 1991 to 4% last year. And a dynamic new export industry was born: software sales went from nowhere to an estimated $8.3 billion last year.
 Liberalisation transformed consumers from supplicants into customers. Any middle-class Indian has a tale about having to wait a decade or more for a car, or lugging back suitcases packed with forbidden goods from foreign trips. Since 1991 the number of serious car makers has jumped from three, making 190,000 old-fashioned vehicles, to ten, making 500,000, some of which would sell anywhere in the world. The number of daily flights between Delhi, India's political capital, and Mumbai, its commercial one, has gone up from three, on one slovenly state-owned airline, to 22, on three competing airlines (including the former monopolist, which has improved its service).
 Not only jet-setters have noticed. Liberalisation has made manufactured goods cheaper relative to farm products, making life a little easier for the farm sector, which still employs more than half the workforce. Manufacturers of consumer goods have discovered rural markets and flooded them with televisions and shampoo in one-rupee sachets.
 Yet India's development is not merely an echo of reform. Agriculture, which accounts for a quarter of economic output, remains tied to the whims of the monsoon rains. The spread of television, to three-quarters of the urban population and a third of country dwellers, owes something to economic reform but also has a life of its own. Ask a manufacturer about the biggest influence on his business in the 1990s, and he is likely to mention television before de-licensing. Kirk Johnson, a sociologist who has studied the effect of its spread on two villages in Maharashtra, found that television not only spurred consumerism, but also made the poor more assertive and encouraged people to mingle more across the boundaries of caste, age and sex.
 Unhappy anniversary
 For all the successes of reform, India is beginning its second decade of economic freedom in a gloomy mood. Growth in fiscal 2000 dropped for the second year running, to an estimated 6.0%, depressed by a truant monsoon and an overhang of industrial capacity built in more buoyant times. A series of scandals-in defence procurement, share trading and customs collection-has temporarily paralysed the government and heightened ordinary Indians' contempt for the institutions that govern them. Indian farmers and industrialists have been spooked by the removal on April 1st of most of the remaining quantitative restrictions on imports, mainly on consumer goods and agricultural products. The only customer of the biggest private power plant, an early symbol of liberalisation, is having trouble paying its bills, and the main shareholder, Enron of Texas, is threatening to pull out.
 These passing maladies point to deeper ills. There are grounds for questioning India's international competitiveness, the integrity of its institutions, the quality of its infrastructure and its zeal for further reform. India's growth since the original reforms were introduced ten years ago looks misshapen: agriculture is shrinking as a share of GDP, as expected, and services are growing rapidly, but industrial growth has been sluggish after an initial spurt. Jairam Ramesh, an independent-minded official of the Congress party, observes scathingly that ""India is the only country in the world which has bypassed industry."" That is partly because industry is especially vulnerable to the whims of the state. Services are fine, but they cannot create the millions of low- and mid-skilled jobs India needs.
 Such worries show up in an investment rate well below what is needed to lift India's growth rate from respectable to spectacular. The appalling deficits of central and state governments have depressed public-sector investment. After a boom in 1994 and 1995, growth in private investment has slowed down. The government wants to quadruple foreign direct investment to $10 billion a year-and China gets $40 billion. The only other population billionaire is achieving growth in GDP and trade, and improvements in the quality of life, that India should envy and emulate (see table 2).
 India's prime minister, Atal Behari Vajpayee, wants to speed up growth to 9%. That is the least he should be aiming for if India is to cope with an expected expansion of the labour force by 2% a year over the next decade. But it will be hard work. Shashanka Bhide of the National Council of Applied Economic Research in Delhi recently calculated that it would require agriculture to grow at an annual rate of 4.5% and non-agricultural sectors at an average of 10%. Even if annual growth in the productivity of land, labour and capital picks up to 3% (after being stuck in the 1990s at close to 2%, according to Mr Bhide), India will need to lift its investment rate from 25% of GDP to 38%. That means, in round figures, $40 billion in extra investment spending every year, including $5 billion from foreign investors.
 As this survey will show, that is unlikely to happen unless the government adopts policies that rekindle the excitement of the early 1990s. And that, in turn, depends on India's leaders at last getting the message that reform is good for India, and ultimately good for them.

Growth in fiscal 2000 dropped for the second year running , to an estimated 6.0 % , depressed by a truant monsoon and an overhang of industrial capacity built in more buoyant times . A series of scandals - in defence procurement , share trading and customs collection - has temporarily paralysed the government and heightened ordinary Indians ' contempt for the institutions that govern them . Indian farmers and industrialists have been spooked by the removal on April 1st of most of the remaining quantitative restrictions on imports , mainly on consumer goods and agricultural products . The only customer of the biggest private power plant , an early symbol of liberalisation , is having trouble paying its bills , and the main shareholder , Enron of Texas , is threatening to pull out . 
  These passing maladies point to deeper ills . There are grounds for questioning India 's international competitiveness , the integrity of its institutions , the quality of its infrastructure and its zeal for further reform . India 's growth since the original reforms were introduced ten years ago looks misshapen : agriculture is shrinking as a share of GDP , as expected , and services are growing rapidly , but industrial growth has been sluggish after an initial spurt . Jairam Ramesh , an independent - minded official of the Congress party , observes scathingly that "" India is the only country in the world which has bypassed industry . "" That is partly because industry is especially vulnerable to the whims of the state . Services are fine , but they can not create the millions of low- and mid - skilled jobs India needs . 
  Such worries show up in an investment rate well below what is needed to lift India 's growth rate from respectable to spectacular . The appalling deficits of central and state governments have depressed public - sector investment . After a boom in 1994 and 1995 , growth in private investment has slowed down . The government wants to quadruple foreign direct investment to $ 10 billion a year - and China gets $ 40 billion . The only other population billionaire is achieving growth in GDP and trade , and improvements in the quality of life , that India should envy and emulate ( see table 2 ) . 
  Atal Bihari Vajpayee's , wants to speed up growth to 9 % . That is the least Atal Bihari Vajpayee should be aiming for if India is to cope with an expected expansion of the labour force by 2 % a year over the next decade . But it will be hard work . Shashanka Bhide of the National Council of Applied Economic Research in Delhi recently calculated that it would require agriculture to grow at an annual rate of 4.5 % and non - agricultural sectors at an average of 10 % . Even if annual growth in the productivity of land , labour and capital picks up to 3 % ( after being stuck in the 1990s at close to 2 % , according to Mr Bhide ) , India will need to lift its investment rate from 25 % of GDP to 38 % . That means , in round figures , $ 40 billion in extra investment spending every year , including $ 5 billion from foreign investors . 
  As this survey will show , that is unlikely to happen unless the government adopts policies that rekindle the excitement of the early 1990s . And that , in turn , depends on India 's leaders at last getting the message that reform is good for India , and ultimately good for them .

 IF INDIA were listed on the stockmarket, it would be a juicy takeover target. A corporate raider would see an enterprise that has raised its game in the past ten years but remains constrained by caution. Surely India's assets could deliver higher returns under new management.
 The new owner's first worry would be an ocean of red ink in which any enterprise might drown. The central government's budget deficit is 5% of GDP; the states' deficits add up to roughly the same again. Fortunately, India finances this shortfall from domestic sources, so it faces no immediate threat of a devastating flight of international capital. Its current-account deficit is less than 2% of GDP. But India pays the price in high real interest rates, which choke off private investment and erode competitiveness.
 The buyer's second concern would be that much of the money is being spent on the wrong things. Wages and salaries, interest payments and subsidies take up an inordinate share of public spending, and the subsidies do little to help the poor. Public investment as a proportion of GDP has been declining. India spends less than 1% of GDP on public provision of health care, well below the average for poor countries. Spending on education is also inadequate, at about 3% of GDP.
 Correcting this requires the draconian pragmatism one expects from a Wall Street raider. Trimming central and state bureaucracy could save nearly 1% of GDP a year, reckon Jeffrey Sachs and Nirupam Bajpai of Harvard University*. Disposing of non-core businesses-virtually all state-owned commercial activities-would help both the public finances and the industries concerned. And the economy would benefit from better-run airlines, hotels and, especially, banks, whose shortcomings are partly responsible for today's high borrowing rates.
 Loss-makers such as electricity, irrigation, railways and universities should not be shut down. On the contrary, they should be revived by allowing them to charge realistic prices and selling off those operations better managed by the private sector, such as electricity distribution. Even schools and health centres can be privately run, as long as the state ensures that they are of acceptable quality and affordable for the poor.
 When it comes to the state's natural monopoly over taxation and law, our acquirer would aim for simplicity and transparency. The current management has made a start. Average import duties have been cut from 87% in 1990 to 34% now. The prime minister's Economic Advisory Council recently recommended that they be lowered further to 12% by 2005. One of the main reasons why the share of taxes in GDP slipped during the reform years, from 11% to 9%, is the unwieldiness of India's indirect tax system. The government has already simplified it, but the raider would go further.
 In the same spirit, he would do away with the thicket of preferences that seek to protect the vulnerable but end up by immobilising them. That category includes laws to stop companies from sacking workers, and therefore from hiring them; the small-sector reservation; bankruptcy procedures that promote neither revival nor liquidation; restrictions on trading agricultural commodities; and rent controls that make low-income housing unviable.
 India is a sprawling conglomerate, best managed not by diktat but by initiative from below. States already have a vital role. Devolution of responsibility to elected village-level government can improve the allocation of resources and monitoring of services such as schools. Decentralisation demands accountability, and the new boss's most urgent job would be to transform India's corporate culture so that officials all the way down to the village administrator embraced the style of governance handed down from the top.
 Getting there
 It may seem callous to apply a Wall Street metaphor to a process as disruptive as economic reform. There is much in the raider's handbook that would help the poor directly, such as shifting funds away from wasteful subsidies towards investment in health and education. But it must also be admitted that some of it would not. Scaling down protection for small handloom units has pushed some weavers to the wall. In Andhra Pradesh, about 40 weavers have committed suicide.
 To alleviate the more painful consequences of reform, the government could spend some of the money it has saved on programmes that simultaneously protect the vulnerable and improve the economy's productive capacity, such as building rural roads. Reform has its casualties, but it is important to recognise how much benefit it has brought India already, and how much more it could bring if pushed further.
 The government knows what to do. Seminars, journals and books by the hundred, often the work of the government's own counsellors, all proffer much the same advice on how to raise India's growth rate from 6-7% to 8-9%. The prime minister, Atal Behari Vajpayee, and the finance minister, Yashwant Sinha, both accept the main points. Their three years in office so far, a record since the 1991 reforms, should have given them the confidence and experience to push through the rest of the reform agenda.
 They have already done several commendable things, such as opening insurance to the private sector and ending telecoms monopolies, and would like to do more. Mr Sinha's most recent budget, presented in February, was unapologetically reformist.
 State governments have not sat still. Madhya Pradesh has an innovative education guarantee scheme that has helped its literacy rate climb nearly 20 points, from 45% in 1991 to 64% this year. Andhra Pradesh has been a pioneer in reforming electricity, transferring control of water usage to farmers and computerising the issuance of government documents, which cuts down on corruption. Tamil Nadu has been a leader in promoting computer education and laying fibre-optic cable. Kerala has the most impressive long-term record, with the highest levels of literacy and life expectancy, and one of the lowest poverty rates in India. Yet no state has succeeded on so many fronts that it can claim to be the model for all others. Kerala, for all its successes, is better known for exporting its well- educated sons and daughters than for importing capital.
 Unfortunately, reformers have even less power to hire and fire than do industrialists. Mr Sinha is stuck with a score of coalition partners, many of whom are suspicious of reform. Parliament, which must approve measures such as liberalising labour legislation, does not seem to grasp that such changes are preconditions for creating jobs. Groups that feel victimised by reform usually shout louder than potential beneficiaries. In Chhattisgarh, carved out from Madhya Pradesh last year, the founding chief minister (a member of the opposition Congress party) has made his reputation by backing a two- month strike at a newly privatised aluminium plant. This may well drive investment away from his fledgling state, but his constituents may never notice.
 Yet countries are not corporations, and no despotic financier is about to seize control of India's democracy. The current managers will keep their jobs, or be replaced by people with a similar outlook. They will persist with reform, pushed a bit faster, perhaps, by straitened public finances and by the progressive liberalisation of imports. But the pace is unlikely to satisfy those who yearn for growth close to double figures, as all Indians should. The Planning Commission recently concluded that 8.7%, the rate needed to double income per head over the next ten years, is out of reach, and has instead proposed 8% as the growth target for 2002-2007. India has gained a plot, but it is unfolding excruciatingly slowly.

 EVEN buttoned-up North Korea talks to its adversary in the south more readily these days than Pakistan and India. Not since February 1999 have these subcontinental foes held a summit meeting. Considering that both are now declared nuclear powers, who have fought three wars in the 54 years since independence and a nasty little battle only two years ago, the failure even to talk is a large part of the reason why their border is often regarded as the world's most dangerous place.
 This weekend, in the shadow of the Taj Mahal-a Muslim monument that should act to remind both sides of their common heritage-Atal Behari Vajpayee, prime minister of India, and General Pervez Musharraf, self-appointed president of Pakistan, aim at least to end the hostile silence. Some good news could well be forthcoming about a possible gas pipeline connecting Iran and India via Pakistan, and India has warmed the temperature in advance with an offer this week to open border-crossings to its west. But all attempts to improve relations between the two countries are liable to founder fast unless progress is made on the most intractable issue: the fact that India controls the mainly-Muslim state of Jammu & Kashmir in apparent defiance of the wishes of its people.
 Kashmir holds all else hostage. It would, in theory, be possible for India and Pakistan to agree to differ over the disputed state and get on with all the other things that urgently need to be talked about: nuclear weapons, troop levels, cross-border trade, water supplies, pipelines and much else. Other countries have managed this. Turkey and Greece have been able to move beyond their differences over Cyprus. Britain's disputes with Spain over Gibraltar and with Argentina over the Falklands are now no obstacle to good relations in other areas.
 But in practice, such a solution is not feasible. Anything that smacks too obviously of acceptance of the status quo would in effect mark a victory for India, and a deep humiliation for Pakistan. Although Pakistan holds a chunk of Kashmir (and China another) which India says it must have back, the reality is that India already possesses the most populous places. Despite its rhetorical demands, India would surely be happy to accept the existing ""line of control"" dividing Indian-held Kashmir from the Pakistani-held bit as a border if that meant Pakistan's abandonment of its claims there. On the last occasion that Pakistan and India met at summit level, in Lahore, something close to setting Kashmir to one side in the interests of the wider relationship was tried: it proved so unpopular with Pakistan's army that three months later it launched an incursion into Indian Kashmir that scuppered the Lahore process.
 India knows that it cannot afford a return to complete breakdown in its relations with Pakistan. America, which has pushed hard for the Agra summit to take place, has enthralled it with the offer of close friendship. But America has also made it clear that India cannot take up the place it thinks it deserves as a regional superpower while it is still fighting a running battle with its neighbour. And the foreign investment India needs would be more likely to flow if the threat of war were removed. So India may now be prepared to make concessions. Pakistan, too, badly needs a deal if only it can be presented as something short of a sell-out; the general is under even greater American pressure than India is, thanks to the far more parlous state of Pakistan's economy (see article).
 The road to peace?
 It is far too early to talk of peace in Kashmir. But there is some reason to hope that the Agra summit may mark the beginning of something that might reasonably be called a peace process. India is already exploring the possibility of talking directly to representatives of Kashmiri groups it formerly considered too militant to touch. There is some reason to hope that Pakistan may be ready to be creative about what was once an inflexible demand that any talks with the Indians should be tripartite, involving the Kashmiris throughout as equal partners.
 And, dimly in the distance, the outlines of a peace deal may be glimpsed: acceptance by Pakistan of something less than Kashmiri secession from India in the form of a much higher degree of autonomy within it, which Pakistan could portray as a kind of victory. The line of control might become a relatively open international border, which would allow the Kashmiris to move freely within their entire state. The Kashmiris might even get recognition of their separate identity in their (Indian) passports. Crucial to this bargain would be a substantial reduction in the number of Indian troops in Kashmir, in return for Pakistan's reining in of the militants it sponsors there. To settle for less than full self-determination for Kashmiris in the face of Indian unwillingness to cede any of its territory would be a bitter cup for Pakistan to drain. But at least the general has no voters to worry about."," This weekend's Indo-Pakistani summit may bring hope of progress on Kashmir

 But in practice, such a solution is not feasible. Anything that smacks too obviously of acceptance of the status quo would in effect mark a victory for India, and a deep humiliation for Pakistan. Although Pakistan holds a chunk of Kashmir (and China another) which India says it must have back, the reality is that India already possesses the most populous places. Despite its rhetorical demands, India would surely be happy to accept the existing ""line of control"" dividing Indian-held Kashmir from the Pakistani-held bit as a border if that meant Pakistan's abandonment of its claims there. On the last occasion that Pakistan and India met at summit level, in Lahore, something close to setting Kashmir to one side in the interests of the wider relationship was tried: it proved so unpopular with Pakistan's army that three months later it launched an incursion into Indian Kashmir that scuppered the Lahore process.
 India knows that it cannot afford a return to complete breakdown in its relations with Pakistan. America, which has pushed hard for the Agra summit to take place, has enthralled it with the offer of close friendship. But America has also made it clear that India cannot take up the place it thinks it deserves as a regional superpower while it is still fighting a running battle with its neighbour. And the foreign investment India needs would be more likely to flow if the threat of war were removed. So India may now be prepared to make concessions. Pakistan, too, badly needs a deal if only it can be presented as something short of a sell-out; the general is under even greater American pressure than India is, thanks to the far more parlous state of Pakistan's economy (see article).
 The road to peace?
 It is far too early to talk of peace in Kashmir. But there is some reason to hope that the Agra summit may mark the beginning of something that might reasonably be called a peace process. India is already exploring the possibility of talking directly to representatives of Kashmiri groups it formerly considered too militant to touch. There is some reason to hope that Pakistan may be ready to be creative about what was once an inflexible demand that any talks with the Indians should be tripartite, involving the Kashmiris throughout as equal partners.
 And, dimly in the distance, the outlines of a peace deal may be glimpsed: acceptance by Pakistan of something less than Kashmiri secession from India in the form of a much higher degree of autonomy within it, which Pakistan could portray as a kind of victory. The line of control might become a relatively open international border, which would allow the Kashmiris to move freely within their entire state. The Kashmiris might even get recognition of their separate identity in their (Indian) passports. Crucial to this bargain would be a substantial reduction in the number of Indian troops in Kashmir, in return for Pakistan's reining in of the militants it sponsors there. To settle for less than full self-determination for Kashmiris in the face of Indian unwillingness to cede any of its territory would be a bitter cup for Pakistan to drain. But at least the general has no voters to worry about.",750,India,A29-8257,,False,,0,True

 PIPING in cheap gas from Iran could solve many of India's pressing energy problems. There is a slight geographical problem, however: the pipeline would have to go through Pakistan, giving India's principal foe a choke-hold on its energy supplies. The very idea provokes nightmares for Indian security experts, who have opposed the idea for a decade. Yet agreement on building such a pipeline-or at least, on conducting a joint feasibility study for one-might be one of the few tangible achievements to emerge from this weekend's meeting in Agra between General Pervez Musharraf, the president of Pakistan, and Atal Behari Vajpayee, India's prime minister.
 Long-term projections suggest that India's demand for gas may increase from 74m cubic metres a day now to 322m a day by 2025. Enormous quantities of cheap gas are available in Iran and Qatar. But, at the moment, transporting it to India is prohibitively expensive. One option is to liquefy the gas and ship it, but calculations suggest that the price of the fuel, once it had been regasified in India, would increase eight-fold. An onshore pipeline across Pakistan, say optimists, could cut that in half.
 A third option, long favoured by India's security experts, would be a sea pipeline from the Gulf to India, bypassing Pakistan's territorial waters. But such a pipeline could cost as much as $5 billion, against a little over $3 billion for the onshore version. Nor would an offshore pipeline be inviolable: it could be hit by submarines or depth charges. Besides, repairing leaks is far more difficult and expensive offshore than onshore.
 However, after a visit to Iran in April, Mr Vajpayee seems to think that the onshore option may be feasible after all. Iran is keen on selling gas to India, and has already commissioned BHP, an Australian company, to do a feasibility study for an onshore pipeline and Snamprogetti, of Italy, to study the offshore option. The Pakistani risk could, perhaps, be diminished if a consortium of multinationals were to build and operate the pipeline, backed by transit guarantees from Pakistan. Besides, the pipeline might yield Pakistan anything from $250m to $600m a year in transit fees, depending on the volume of gas. The country is deep in foreign debt, and would have a strong incentive to keep the tap open.
 But some Indians fear that even this would not be a guarantee of Pakistani compliance. Instead, they would like an agreement whereby the gas pipeline would fuel a huge power plant in India that would also supply electricity to Pakistan, maybe to a big city like Lahore. With that, any disruption of the gas supply by Pakistan would mean a blackout for Lahore as well.","  India and Pakistan hope to agree on a pipeline

 THERE is an old saying among diplomats that ""nothing is agreed until everything is agreed,"" which is why, despite all the goodwill and optimism at the start of last weekend's Indo-Pakistani summit, the ending came with recrimination, deadlock and a midnight dash for the airport (see page 57). Pervez Musharraf, Pakistan's self- appointed president, and Atal Behari Vajpayee, India's prime minister, could not agree on any form of joint statement, or even to hold a press conference explaining what had gone wrong.
 What had gone wrong, of course, was Kashmir. Had a way been found to fudge the Kashmir issue, much else was ready to be approved: joint action on narcotics, confidence-building measures to reduce tension between the two nuclear-equipped military establishments, oil pipelines, trade and, most important of all, regular annual summits, six-monthly foreign ministers' meetings and a host of the lesser official dialogues that form the normal framework for intercourse between neighbours who are not enemies. But Kashmir, as had always seemed likely, held all else hostage.
 On this issue, it is difficult for either side to make any form of concession. In many Indian minds, talk of autonomy, let alone independence, for Kashmir threatens the much wider unravelling of the country. For Pakistan, riddled as it is with tens if not hundreds of thousands of well-armed Islamic militants for whom the Kashmiri jihad is a sacred cause, any hint of backsliding is dangerous. Mr Vajpayee heads a coalition government and faces strong opposition to compromise from hardliners within his own Hindu-nationalist party. General Musharraf may not have a coalition to worry about, but he certainly has two powerful and in practice not entirely distinct groups to keep on the right side of: his own fellow-officers, and the jihadis, who even before they heard of the collapse of the summit were threatening a return to war. That is why both sides often seem so determined to delimit the outcome of any negotiating procedure before they even begin it.
 After the Agra meeting, can there be any picking up of the pieces? Two good consequences, at least, may have emerged from the summit. The first is that, before things got tricky, Mr Vajpayee and General Musharraf had agreed on a return meeting in Islamabad, possibly in December, and that after it collapsed the principle of the visit was reaffirmed. They are also likely to meet in September at the UN General Assembly.
 The second is that India was apparently ready to take at least a step towards acknowledging what is obvious to any non-Indian: that Kashmir is a serious obstacle standing in the way of normal relations between the subcontinent's largest countries and that, without progress on it, there cannot be much progress on anything else. This would have constituted a big shift. India's previous formulation, dating back to the Lahore summit of 1999, was to treat Kashmir as simply one of a large range of questions for the two countries to discuss. To Pakistan, that is problematic. What it fears, reasonably, is that India would scoop up all the benefits of a normalised relationship, while continuing to stall on Kashmir. The status quo suits India better than Pakistan since it currently controls most of the state. With the summit deadlocked, the Indian concession is off the table again: but in Agra it was there in principle.
 The price of progress
 Progress, in any event, seems to have only been on offer at a price. In return for moving closer to an acceptance of the centrality of Kashmir, Mr Vajpayee insisted that Pakistan should agree that the problem of ""cross-border terrorism"" had to be discussed. These are hard words for any Pakistani president, even a dictatorial one, to accept. To Pakistan the activity of the Kashmiri militants is not terrorism but freedom-fighting: and nor is it ""cross-border"", since the ""line of control"" separating Indian- from Pakistan-held Kashmir is not viewed as a border at all, the militants being Kashmiris fighting in their own land. But on this, his first foray to India since he left it as a child in 1947, General Musharraf needed to buttress his authority at home by standing his ground, so it is entirely possible that at a later meeting a form of words may be found to bridge the gap.
 It is true that both sides found it disappointingly hard to resist sounding off in public while the talks were under way, never wise in a sensitive negotiation. But if the two meetings go ahead as planned before the end of the year, and if Pakistan can rein in the militants before they commit the sort of atrocity that would derail the entire enterprise, there is still a chance that the foundations of the Agra summit can be built on.","  The India - Pakistan summit in Agra looked like a disaster .

 JUST before midnight on July 16th, President Pervez Musharraf, Pakistan's military ruler, put a dramatic end to a three-day summit in the Indian city of Agra by walking out of a final meeting with India's prime minister, Atal Behari Vajpayee, and flying home to Islamabad. The summit had begun two days earlier with expansive gestures and well-choreographed symbolism. But it appeared to have broken down so badly over the disputed state of Kashmir and cross- border terrorism that there were immediate fears that the two nuclear powers would be tempted to step up their border skirmishes.
 Yet, a day later, both sides were insisting that there had been no breakdown, just a disagreement over a few words in a proposed declaration, which could be solved when they next met. First, the two foreign ministers held press conferences that mixed recriminations with hopes for the future. More significantly, both Mr Vajpayee and General Musharraf then addressed their top officials and seemed to be trying to sideline their critics and sustain the momentum for talks. Mr Vajpayee even told his Council of Ministers that the summit had been ""successful"".
 It is not yet clear whether this will turn out to be merely an exercise in damage limitation or evidence of a meeting of minds between two leaders who may now be able to pull their countries closer together. Certainly, these two very different men--one a slow- speaking 74-year-old veteran politician, the other a loquacious but tough 57-year-old general who made himself president last month-- seem to have got on unexpectedly well together. They met alone for almost six hours during the summit and it looks as though the eventual failure to reach agreement was caused more by their hardline ministers and advisers than by their own unwillingness to come to terms.
 General Musharraf had set an unexpectedly favourable tone when he arrived in India on July 14th. At the tomb of Mahatma Gandhi, the father of the Indian nation, he praised Mr Gandhi's ""struggle for non- violence and peace"". In the evening he surprised his hosts by admitting at a banquet that there could be ""no military solution"" to the 54-year-old dispute over Kashmir--a significant statement for the chief of army staff who had directed Pakistan's unsuccessful battles with India at Kargil in Kashmir two years ago. He added that the summit should set out to solve the issue ""once and for all"".
 A joint declaration that was readied for signature on Monday provided for annual summits between the two leaders and six-monthly meetings between their foreign ministers. It listed nine points for discussion, including the Siachen Glacier, where the two countries have waged an expensive and inconclusive battle for 17 years, other disputed border issues, narcotics, nuclear safeguards and trade.
 But Kashmir dogged progress. On the second day of talking Sushma Swaraj, India's information minister, pointedly failed to include Kashmir among the topics that she told journalists had been discussed. Pakistan responded with a terse statement stressing Kashmir's centrality to any talks, and General Musharraf next morning went on television for over an hour, repeatedly telling Indian editors over breakfast that ""Kashmir is the main issue"". India, annoyed by such a publicity stunt in the middle of a summit, issued the text of a statement made a day earlier by Mr Vajpayee at the leaders' first meeting, when he had virtually accused Pakistan of sponsoring cross-border terrorism and said this must be included in any talks.
 Some compromises were made. Pakistan had wanted India formally to accept that there was a ""dispute"" over Kashmir. India has consistently resisted this because it has regarded Kashmir as part of India since the two countries were partitioned in 1947 and because it does not want to open the way for possible third-party mediation. General Musharraf compromised by accepting the word ""issue"" instead of ""dispute"", but disagreement continued over how to express what both sides called the ""centrality"" of Kashmir.
 This would probably have been ironed out had there not been a final breakdown over an associated matter--the insertion of the words ""cross-border"" in the declaration. It appears that the two leaders agreed that the declaration should just refer to ""terrorism"", but that hawks on the Indian side, apparently led by L.K. Advani, the home minister, insisted on adding ""cross-border"" in order to nail down Pakistan's responsibility for allowing Islamic militants to cross into India from its territory. This was a deal-breaker for the general.
 The two leaders will probably meet next during the UN General Assembly in New York in September. Mr Vajpayee has also accepted an invitation to visit Pakistan but he may well hang back until there is less risk of hardliners again blocking progress because of the Kashmir and terrorism issues. This means finding a compromise that takes account of the ""centrality"" of the Kashmir question that is required by Pakistan, and of the ""cross-border terrorism"" issue demanded by India. Difficult--but certainly not impossible.","  The Indo - Pakistani summit came close to success , and may yet achieve it if the hardliners on both sides can be restrained

PERVEZ MUSHARRAF, the self-styled president of Pakistan, is widely seen in India as having got the better of Atal Behari Vajpayee, the prime minister, at this month's summit in Agra. He almost got him to sign a draft declaration that omitted all reference to Pakistani-sponsored cross-border terrorism in Kashmir. Lal Krishna Advani, India's home minister, is winning plaudits as the man reputed to have killed the draft. As a result, the nationalist wing of the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) now looks more than ever to Mr Advani to uphold its traditional values, which it feels are being eroded by the liberal wing headed by Mr Vajpayee.
Many in the party want Mr Advani to be made deputy prime minister. He is younger than Mr Vajpayee and in better health. Mr Vajpayee has looked bemused at recent public meetings: on one occasion he could not remember the name of his own foreign minister and had to be prompted. Though he looks likely to serve out the remaining three years of his current term, Mr Advani may well take over after that. That could mean a hardening of policy towards Pakistan. 
Mr Advani was born in 1929 in Karachi, now part of Pakistan. In his youth, he became the local head of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS), a Hindu-nationalist organisation that later gave birth to the BJP. In 1990 he undertook a carriage ride through India to galvanise Hindu opinion in favour of pulling down a mosque at Ayodhya, and erecting in its place a temple to the Hindu god Ram.
The enthusiasm he generated enabled the party to win 120 seats in the 1991 election, and come within striking distance of power for the first time. But most Hindus were repelled by the destruction of the mosque in 1992. They voted the BJP out of power in three major north Indian states in the 1993 state elections, including Uttar Pradesh, the state in which Ayodhya lies. This showed that, though extremism had enabled the BJP to achieve critical mass, it had also become an obstacle to it attaining power in New Delhi.
At that point Mr Vajpayee's liberalism came to its rescue. He too had been a member of the RSS in his youth. But he had consistently opposed the destruction of the mosque at Ayodhya. He saw that the party could never come to power purely on the back of Hindu extremism: it needed to exploit other causes too. The RSS criticised this as dilution of the party ethos; Mr Vajpayee called it evolution. His tactics enabled him to cobble together a coalition government in 1998 and again in 1999.
The RSS now looks to Mr Advani to restore its old influence. Many observers have speculated that the BJP will at some point split, with the liberals and Hindu-nationalists going in separate directions. But the very fact that Mr Advani is now the heir-apparent gives hope to the disgruntled. They now plan to take control of the party from within.

Atal Bihari Vajpayee saw that the party could never come to power purely on the back of Hindu extremism : it needed to exploit other causes too . The RSS criticised this as dilution of the party ethos ; Atal Bihari Vajpayee called it evolution . Atal Bihari Vajpayee's tactics enabled Atal Bihari Vajpayee to cobble together a coalition government in 1998 and again in 1999 . 
 The RSS now looks to Mr Advani to restore its old influence . Many observers have speculated that the BJP will at some point split , with the liberals and Hindu - nationalists going in separate directions . But the very fact that Mr Advani is now the heir - apparent gives hope to the disgruntled . They now plan to take control of the party from within .

 ONE can hardly blame Atal Behari Vajpayee, India's prime minister, for wanting to give up. The economy is sluggish, the recent summit with Pakistan failed to produce a breakthrough and India's biggest savings scheme has all but collapsed. An attempt to widen a ceasefire with one group of separatists in the north-east has foundered on violent opposition from other north-easterners. Mr Vajpayee's government has been pilloried for all this not just by the opposition but by members of his fractious 19-party coalition, including voices within his own Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP). On July 31st he stunned them by offering to resign at a meeting of BJP members of Parliament.
 He relented just as suddenly. ""Party members in one voice said that Vajpayee could not be allowed to leave,"" said the parliamentary- affairs minister. The episode arises from the ineffectiveness of the current set-up, but also points to a certain resilience in it.
 The government has lately suffered many indignities and has few successes with which to counter them. They began in March when several defence officials and top politicians, including the head of the BJP, were caught by journalists on camera accepting bribes in exchange for promoting sales by a fictitious arms manufacturer. The BJP and its allies proceeded to perform dismally in several state elections. Now the ruling party--and in particular the finance minister--is being accused of sharing responsibility for malpractices at India's largest savings scheme, which has hurt 20m investors.
 The carping would matter less if Mr Vajpayee were making progress on the biggest issues: its dispute with Pakistan over the mainly Muslim province of Kashmir and the reform of the economy. His invitation to Pakistan's leader was seen as an act of statesmanship, but Pakistan did better at exploiting the disputation at the summit that followed. Mr Vajpayee showed similar courage in embarking on economic reforms, and similar drift in enacting them.
 Willing as they are to abuse Mr Vajpayee, his friends are not prepared to topple him. The likeliest successor in the sitting parliament would be the home minister, L.K. Advani, who is regarded as too unbending by several coalition partners. Mr Vajpayee's threat to resign may have been calculated to remind them of this. If so, it worked. The day after, the NDA pledged fealty. In some ways, the alliance is growing more secure. A couple of parties that broke with it to fight state elections on their own are now rejoining, or trying to. The main immediate threat to the government may be the 76-year- old prime minister's low morale.","  Atal Bihari Vajpayee's confronts Atal Bihari Vajpayee's many critics

 ANOTHER week, another government bail-out. This time it's the flagship Industrial Finance Corporation of India (IFCI), which had ducked some principal payments on its bonds. IFCI was founded in 1948 and is the third-biggest long-term lender in India. It was made a joint-stock company in 1993, but is still majority government-owned through the Industrial Development Bank of India and other institutions. IFCI has borne the cost of India's history of inefficient industrial development, frequently as a pawn in the game of graft and political patronage. The price today is a bailout costing some 10 billion rupees ($210m), three-fifths to be met by core shareholders, two-fifths in the form of 20-year convertible bonds financed by the government.
 This follows a partial bail-out in July of 20m investors in India's biggest equity savings scheme: US-64, a fund managed by the Unit Trust of India (UTI). The prime minister, Atal Behari Vajpayee, threatened to resign last week, in part because of the UTI affair, but was persuaded to stay.
 Another indignity came on August 7th when India's shaky finances prompted Standard and Poor's, a rating agency, to announce a downgrading of the country's local-currency rating, from BBB to BBB- minus. The reason was India's ""unchecked"" budget deficit and rising domestic indebtedness--close, respectively, to 10% and 70% of GDP. On August 8th Moody's, another agency, downgraded both India's foreign- and local-currency ratings.
 A decade of economic reforms has failed to loosen the government's grasp over the country's biggest banks, insurance companies and mutual funds. They control four-fifths of bank assets, two-thirds of mutual-fund assets and the entire insurance industry. In the days of a centralised economy, these institutions were key agents of state control and capital allocation. They used their near-sovereign ratings (because of an implicit government guarantee on their borrowings) to mop up cheap money and to allocate it as the state wished, often funding budget deficits. After liberalisation in the 1990s, when managing risk became more arduous, and prudential rules were introduced, their health began to fail. Their non-performing loans total over 790 billion rupees, or around 4% of GDP, and their credit ratings are lower than those of top corporate borrowers.
 Following the bail-outs, the government has tightened its control over IFCI and UTI, a setback for liberalisation. The new head of UTI is a bureaucrat, while the post of government nominee to the board-- abolished a few years ago--has been revived. The injection of convertible bonds to bolster IFCI's capital will make the government a direct stakeholder. Politicians will continue to meddle in the running of these institutions, which is the main reason for their problems in the first place.
 The government's handling of UTI, with investigations by three separate groups--a team of parliamentarians, the police and a panel of experts--looks more like an attempt to whitewash politicians rather than to nail the problem. The UTI's former chief, Pavagada Subramanyam, who faces criminal charges over a private deal to buy shares--now worthless--in a software company, will probably be made a scapegoat.
 Industrial Development Bank of India, the country's biggest development bank and a cash-strapped one to boot, came reluctantly to the rescue of both IFCI and UTI. Now it could be next in line for a government bail-out itself, a former finance minister, Manmohan Singh, warns. Crisil, a rating agency, downgraded the development bank last month, concerned by the poor quality of its assets. Meanwhile, the government is still looking for someone to head the bank, six months after the previous chief retired.
 These state institutions hold most of India's household savings, and savers continue to pour money into them in the belief that they enjoy ample government protection. Weaning people from that belief-- which distorts economic decisions--will not be easy. Meanwhile, the market has given its verdict. The shares of Industrial Development Bank of India, for one, trade at one-seventh of their issue price six years ago."," One more bail-out hits India's credit rating

 INDIAN governments have had precious little success in pushing legislation through parliament or implementing economic reforms since 1996, when shifting multi-party coalitions replaced the Congress Party as the dominant force in the country's politics. This year, rows about issues ranging from corruption over defence contracts to the collapse of the country's largest unit trust have continually disrupted parliamentary proceedings and built up a backlog of more than 40 bills. As a result, the government, led by the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), has found it hard to carry out badly-needed changes like cutting subsidies and increasing electricity tariffs, though its privatisation programme is just starting to splutter into life.
 A month-long winter parliamentary session that began this week looks like being another time-waster, because the opposition has a new weapon with which to beat the BJP: the Prevention of Terrorism Ordinance (POTO), which the government introduced in the wake of September 11th. Opponents claim the ordinance, which will lapse unless it is passed this session, infringes human rights and will lead to abuse of minorities. They also claim the Hindu-nationalist BJP's main preoccupation is not to fight terror but to win votes in important state elections early next year by showing that it is prepared to get tough with Muslim extremists.
 Arun Shourie, minister for disinvestment, says that the government's implementation problems inside and outside parliament stem from ""a fractured electorate that leads to a fractured legislature"" and from an opposition that has a ""perverse concept of what it means to be out of office""--a reference to the BJP's 24- party coalition and to the Congress Party which leads the opposition. As a result, says Mr Shourie, ""everyone has enough power to block everything and no one has enough power to see anything through.""
 Mr Shourie's point is that the BJP's economic reforms are restricted by pressures from its coalition partners, often encouraged by vested business and other interests which then encourage bureaucrats to delay implementation of policies. Reforms are also opposed by the Congress Party, even though it started them in 1991 and is still cheerfully implementing them in states where it controls the assembly. Similarly Congress threatens to block POTO in the Rajya Sabha, the upper house of parliament where it holds a majority, even though Congress-run states either have their own versions of the ordinance or have supported similar ones.
 The government believes POTO is needed to make it easier and faster for the authorities to deal with suspected terrorists and to bypass delays in India's tortuous legal system, where over 2m cases are pending in the courts. POTO bans 24 terrorist organisations, widens the definition of terrorism, increases powers of investigation, makes it easier for courts to refuse bail, and requires journalists to hand over sensitive information. It has led to an outcry from lawyers and India's National Human Rights Commission as well as from Congress--which wants to win the Muslim minority vote in state elections.
 The assembly election at the heart of the POTO storm is in Uttar Pradesh. This is India's largest state and has a population of nearly 170m, dominated by Hindus but including a significant Muslim minority. The vote is expected in mid-February and the BJP is likely to lose power. Between now and polling day, all the central government's policies and announcements will be geared to this election. This will affect relations with Pakistan, since the BJP will be wooing the Hindu vote by taking a hard line over Pakistan's encouragement of terrorism in Kashmir.
 Economic reforms that would upset important vote banks such as farmers are also being held back, even though little progress has been made on many of the proposals set out in the annual budget last February. Seen against this general background of inaction, the first signs of progress on privatisation are therefore welcome. After failing to find buyers for Air India and Indian Airlines, and running into flak over privatising a bakery and an aluminium company, the government last month sold controlling stakes in two businesses involved in computers and telecoms equipment--with little opposition.
 In the past two weeks it has found buyers for eight loss-making and heavily over-manned hotels and is now hoping to sell ten more companies in the next four months, including VSNL, the government's international telecoms and internet operator, and two petroleum corporations. But the opposition is not over: two of the hotel sales have been challenged this week in the courts by local managers, and a supreme court ruling on the validity of the aluminium company sale is expected soon. There is also political, bureaucratic and managerial opposition to the sale of VSNL, which could lead to delays. Life in a fractured legislature, it seems, is not much fun."," Having 23 combative coalition partners to please spells chaos for India's prime minister, Atal Behari Vajpayee
 INDIAN governments have had precious little success in pushing legislation through parliament or implementing economic reforms since 1996, when shifting multi-party coalitions replaced the Congress Party as the dominant force in the country's politics. This year, rows about issues ranging from corruption over defence contracts to the collapse of the country's largest unit trust have continually disrupted parliamentary proceedings and built up a backlog of more than 40 bills. As a result, the government, led by the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), has found it hard to carry out badly-needed changes like cutting subsidies and increasing electricity tariffs, though its privatisation programme is just starting to splutter into life.
 A month-long winter parliamentary session that began this week looks like being another time-waster, because the opposition has a new weapon with which to beat the BJP: the Prevention of Terrorism Ordinance (POTO), which the government introduced in the wake of September 11th. Opponents claim the ordinance, which will lapse unless it is passed this session, infringes human rights and will lead to abuse of minorities. They also claim the Hindu-nationalist BJP's main preoccupation is not to fight terror but to win votes in important state elections early next year by showing that it is prepared to get tough with Muslim extremists.
 Arun Shourie, minister for disinvestment, says that the government's implementation problems inside and outside parliament stem from ""a fractured electorate that leads to a fractured legislature"" and from an opposition that has a ""perverse concept of what it means to be out of office""--a reference to the BJP's 24- party coalition and to the Congress Party which leads the opposition. As a result, says Mr Shourie, ""everyone has enough power to block everything and no one has enough power to see anything through.""
 Mr Shourie's point is that the BJP's economic reforms are restricted by pressures from its coalition partners, often encouraged by vested business and other interests which then encourage bureaucrats to delay implementation of policies. Reforms are also opposed by the Congress Party, even though it started them in 1991 and is still cheerfully implementing them in states where it controls the assembly. Similarly Congress threatens to block POTO in the Rajya Sabha, the upper house of parliament where it holds a majority, even though Congress-run states either have their own versions of the ordinance or have supported similar ones.
 The government believes POTO is needed to make it easier and faster for the authorities to deal with suspected terrorists and to bypass delays in India's tortuous legal system, where over 2m cases are pending in the courts. POTO bans 24 terrorist organisations, widens the definition of terrorism, increases powers of investigation, makes it easier for courts to refuse bail, and requires journalists to hand over sensitive information. It has led to an outcry from lawyers and India's National Human Rights Commission as well as from Congress--which wants to win the Muslim minority vote in state elections.

 Ashok Kumar, a star of India, died on December 10th, aged 90
 ANY visitor to India seeking the flavour of the country could do worse than to visit a cinema in one of the big cities. Almost certainly the dialogue will be in Hindi. But never mind, the simple story that unfolds will be readily comprehensible: of love triumphant, of treachery exposed. Whatever the barriers, the forces of good are destined to triumph, urged on by an audience happily showing its emotions: one that claps the hero's entrance, one that sighs for the heroine. This was the India that Ashok Kumar served for nearly 70 years, providing for a few rupees some escape from the grind of life.
 He was known affectionately as Dadamoni, which translates roughly as ""respected elder brother"". The prime minister, Atal Behari Vajpayee, spoke of Mr Kumar's ""emotive appeal"", aware that for many his death was of more importance than that of any politician. Mostly, politicians could only offer promises of a sunnier world. In his films Mr Kumar always delivered. He might have done well in politics, a career pursued in India by a number of former film stars. But he felt that he would have let down his fans. Politicians are not highly regarded in India.
 Mr Kumar liked to recall the days when acting itself was regarded as disreputable. His parents wanted him to become a lawyer, and he dutifully obtained a law degree. When he announced in 1935 that he had the offer of a role in films at a company called Bombay Talkies ""my mother started weeping"" and his engagement to a girl of ""good family"" was broken off. With such a lobby against him he pleaded with Bombay Talkies for a job other than acting. As a director, perhaps? But Mr Kumar was good looking and the film was ready to shoot. Take it or leave it. Rather than join the five other members of his family who had become lawyers, he took it. He was good enough to be kept on and in his third film, ""Achhut Kanya"", a story of love between a Brahmin and a low-caste girl, was a hit. Other successes followed, notably ""Kismet"" which at one cinema ran for three years. Mr Kumar became respectable enough to marry. A suitable bride was found and introduced to him the day before the wedding. The marriage lasted for 50 years, until Mrs Kumar died. It was said to be enduringly blissful. Nothing less was expected of Ashok Kumar.
 Being natural
 India's film industry is the world's biggest measured by the number of films produced, about 800 a year. It has an annual turnover of about $1.3 billion and employs more than 6m people. Few of its films are shown outside India. The late Satyajit Ray, much admired by European and American film critics, was not typical of Indian directors. In India his films tended to be coolly received by the public disappointed by his less than happy stories, however much they were praised in Cannes. ""Lagaan"", directed by Ashutosh Gowariker, set in British India in the 19th century and nearly four hours long, has been getting good reviews this year both in India and internationally. But such films are still the exception to the formulaic quickies of what has come to be known as Bollywood (the B probably stands for Bombay, where films were first made in 1897). Bollywood's productivity can be impressive, with top stars being involved in perhaps a dozen films at a time, moving from set to set and role to role. A feature film in Hindi can be made for as little as $1m, no more than the coffee bill in an American studio.
 Ashok Kumar appeared in so many films that even his admirers lost count; some say 200, others claim almost 300. By film standards he lived modestly. His main indulgence was vintage cars. His regular drink was water, lots of it, a practice to which he attributed a healthy old age. He was modest about his films, many of which were standard Bollywood fare. Some of the early ones, where Mr Kumar suddenly and improbably bursts into song, may best be forgotten. But as he developed, Mr Kumar's acting took on an authority unusual in Indian films. He had been watching films since he was a child, when they were shown on hand-cranked projectors in tents in his native Bihar. Later he watched British and American films, and styled himself on English-speaking actors, especially Humphrey Bogart. He told a reporter, You see, our Indian style of acting was very different. We spoke our lines in a particular way which I didn't much like. I always thought natural was best. Every role is a problem. Enacting them to retain the naturalness: that's the fun of it. There was a scene where I had to rush to work in the early morning. I was not used to rushing to work. I have always had leisurely breakfasts because we work so hard all day. This time I told my wife I wanted breakfast fast. I just gulped the tea down and walked out of the house. When I reached the set I acted out the scene as I had that morning at home.
 Mr Kumar's audiences may not have been familiar with the finer points of acting, but they recognised with pleasure some bit of business that looked right. He had a way of holding a cigarette that was adopted by millions of Indians. It might be dismissed as a mannerism (and in the healthful West perhaps frowned on). But in Indian cinemas the sight of Ashok Kumar coolly lighting up only provoked murmurs of delight.

 THEIR armies continue to menace each other and worries of nuclear hostilities persist, but India and Pakistan now confront each other more as gamblers than as gladiators. The latest crisis in their relations began on December 13th, when terrorists, apparently trained in Pakistan, attacked India's Parliament in an attempt to murder senior politicians, and ended up killing several security officers. India demanded that Pakistan should act against the terrorist groups. It reduced transport and diplomatic links with Pakistan and mobilised its army. Alarmed, the United States and other outside powers sought compliance from Pakistan and cool-headedness from India.
 The pressure has had some effect. Pakistan's military-led government has arrested the leaders of the two groups India blames for the attack, Lashkar-e-Taiba and Jaish-e-Muhammad, along with about a hundred of their followers, and frozen their accounts. India's foreign minister has described the arrests as a ""step in the right direction"". There is talk, though no certainty, of a meeting between Pakistani and Indian officials at a regional summit in Katmandu that begins on January 4th. Neither country wants war. Britain's prime minister, Tony Blair, will try to forestall one in his current, previously planned visit to the region. But while the glaring lasts, India and Pakistan will manoeuvre for advantage in their half-century-old dispute over Kashmir, the Muslim-majority state that is divided between them.
 The crisis is far from over. India does not think Pakistan's crackdown has gone far enough. It wants more, and more-senior, terrorists behind bars, and scoffs at the immobilising of nearly empty bank accounts. It has demanded from Pakistan the extradition of 20 suspected terrorists. Lashkar-e-Taiba and Jaish-e-Muhammad themselves say they have merely shifted their offices from Pakistan proper to Pakistan-administered Kashmir. Worse, the terrorism has not stopped. Three attacks were reported on January 1st, one involving the murder of six civilians in India's part of Kashmir. The next day, grenades tossed near Kashmir's parliament killed a policeman and injured 20 other people. Such attacks could still provoke Indian retaliation inside Pakistan.
 Oddly, though, the persistence of terrorism points to one reason why India and Pakistan may not fight: Pakistan's president, Pervez Musharraf, seems to have limited control over it. The importance of this to Indian thinking is hard to judge because it is new. Groups such as Lashkar-e-Taiba and Jaish-e-Muhammad have been allies of successive Pakistani governments. Their cause of freeing Kashmir from Indian rule has been a primary aim of Pakistan's foreign policy since its founding. Pakistan's military Inter Services Intelligence agency (ISI) has helped them in all sorts of ways.
 The American war on terror has shaken that alliance, if not quite broken it. The militant groups, which share the ideology of the Taliban and al-Qaeda, regard General Musharraf as a traitor for joining the American side. Al-Qaeda's attacks on America have discredited terrorism in international eyes as a means of ousting India from Kashmir, if not the end itself. General Musharraf hoped to preserve a distinction between terrorists and Kashmiri freedom fighters, but India, most foreign governments and the terrorists themselves will not let him. On December 26th the United States branded Lashkar and Jaish terrorist outfits.
 And so General Musharraf must find a way to deal with such groups that mollifies India and satisfies his allies in the international anti-terror coalition without abandoning the cause of Kashmir or provoking an uprising against his rule. This is fiendishly difficult. General Musharraf has been keen to stamp out religious violence within Pakistan; his foreign minister has promised to ""co-operate fully"" with India against terrorism. There is speculation that Pakistan will shift support from groups such as Lashkar-e-Taiba, which mainly recruits Pakistanis, to mainly Kashmiri outfits, such as Hizbul Mujahideen, and encourage them to attack security forces rather than civilians. But India is unlikely to accept this as amounting to a renunciation of terrorism.
 Questions persist about how fully General Musharraf controls the ISI, though he recently replaced its chief. C. Uday Bhaskar, of the Institute for Defence Studies and Analyses in Delhi, calls the agency ""an army within an army"", fired by ideology. Would the general survive a real crackdown on the terrorists? The assassination on December 21st of the brother of Pakistan's interior minister, who is leading the offensive against religious extremists within Pakistan, is being read as a warning. General Musharraf is not Mullah Mohammed Omar, the leader of the Taliban, but his successor might be. ""It is not in our interest to push Musharraf beyond a point,"" says Commodore Bhaskar.
 If this is true, it would make little sense for India to go to war against him. But the threat of military action is India's only means of defending itself, of forcing the general to tackle the militants, and of mobilising other countries to intercede with the general.
 One way out of the maze is to offer Pakistan an incentive to stop terrorism. India's prime minister, Atal Behari Vajpayee, sought to do this in his ""new year reflections"", offering to walk ""more than half the distance"" to resolve disputes with Pakistan, including that over Kashmir. Serious Kashmir talks would make it easier for General Musharraf to curb the insurgents.
 Though it has opened with portents of war, this might just be Kashmir's year. An election to the state's assembly is due in the autumn, and Mr Vajpayee has promised that it will be free and fair, which would make a change. The government has been trying to entice separatist Kashmiris to take part and hints that some form of autonomy will be available in exchange for peace. It is conceivable that the war scare will prompt India to resolve the intractable problem of how to incorporate Pakistan into a dialogue with Kashmiris without implying that India's sovereignty over the state is up for negotiation. The trouble is that Pakistan may deem unserious any process that forecloses this possibility. Mr Vajpayee's ""more than half the distance"" may thus look to General Musharraf not nearly far enough. In this gap, peace can easily go astray.","  But the threat of war may encourage sensible thinking on terrorism and on Kashmir

 DURING a meeting between Pakistan's president, General Pervez Musharraf, and newspaper editors shortly after September 11th, one participant asked the president if he was now prepared to take off the kid gloves and deal with Islamic extremists bent upon stirring up trouble. ""Don't be negative,"" snapped the general. ""I know how to deal with the situation."" But it has taken the threat of a full- scale war with India and telephone calls from President George Bush urging General Musharraf to ""do more against Islamic terrorism"" for the promise to start to become a reality.
 India was provoked by a terrorist attack on its Parliament building in Delhi on December 13th in which 14 people died. Threatening war, it held two Pakistan-based groups--Jaish-e-Muhammad and Lashkar-e-Taiba--responsible. Both had earlier admitted they were conducting guerrilla warfare in Indian-held Kashmir and one had even threatened to carry its attacks to Delhi. General Musharraf ordered the arrest of the leaders of the two groups and scores of their followers when international pressure to crack down on them became unbearable, though he unconvincingly maintains the arrests were not related to Indian accusations.
 ""The iron fist will be revealed soon,"" Major-General Rashid Qureshi, Pakistan's government spokesman, promised this week. He was referring to a planned speech to the nation by General Musharraf over the weekend in which the president is expected to outline stiff measures against religious extremists. Mullahs will not be allowed to use their mosques to preach sectarian hatred or deliver political sermons from the pulpit. Incitement to violence will be strictly dealt with. Military tribunals may even be established to tackle religious terrorism because the judiciary is afraid of taking on the fundamentalists.
 A further idea of what may be in store was provided by General Moinuddin Haider, the interior minister. ""We have decided to bring over 10,000 religious schools and seminaries controlled by the mullahs into the ambit of our mainstream educational system and to subject them to scrutiny,"" he said. ""Every madrassa [religious school] will be asked to furnish details of its income and foreign students."" Mr Haider's brother was assassinated a month ago by unknown terrorists in Karachi, apparently as a warning to him. Even more intriguing, there are reports that General Musharraf has ordered the country's powerful Inter Services Intelligence agency (ISI), which is credited with running covert wars in Afghanistan and Kashmir, to end its backing for Islamic militant groups fighting in Kashmir.
 Hints about the measures that General Musharraf is expected to announce also came from a group of visiting American senators who met the Pakistani president last week. One said the general seemed ready to tackle the scourge of religious extremism. Another thought he was a hero for taking such ""hard and risky"" decisions. An American diplomat said that his forthcoming speech was being billed by government sources as the ""debut of Jinnah II"", a reference to the secular founder of Pakistan, Mohammed Ali Jinnah, whose liberal ideas and modern vision have all but been forgotten by opportunist Pakistani leaders.
 Some observers think it is all too good to be true, noting that most of the reforms have been promised before, and that there have been many false dawns in the past. Others, though, note that the general has no real choice after having sided with the United States over Afghanistan. ""The battle lines are drawn. He must get the mullahs before they get him,"" says one. General Musharraf's personal security has been strengthened. Fortunately for him, no public backlash is expected when he moves to take on the fundamentalists. Most Pakistanis do not like the mullahs, do not vote for their parties in elections and did not in any numbers join the agitation against the government after the American intervention against the Taliban.
 ""The real challenge, however, will come over restructuring the ISI, which has become a state within a state and is running our foreign and domestic policies,"" says a member of General Musharraf's cabinet. But there may be grounds for optimism. According to reliable sources, the general has called a halt to the ISI's external operations, for the time being at least, and got rid of the most belligerent of the old guard. ""The new lot is decidedly liberal and less aggressive than the old one,"" says an insider. Whether all this will persuade India to start peace talks with Pakistan, and move towards a solution to the problem of Kashmir, still remains to be seen.

 DURING a meeting between Pakistan's president, General Pervez Musharraf, and newspaper editors shortly after September 11th, one participant asked the president if he was now prepared to take off the kid gloves and deal with Islamic extremists bent upon stirring up trouble. ""Don't be negative,"" snapped the general. ""I know how to deal with the situation."" But it has taken the threat of a full- scale war with India and telephone calls from President George Bush urging General Musharraf to ""do more against Islamic terrorism"" for the promise to start to become a reality.
 India was provoked by a terrorist attack on its Parliament building in Delhi on December 13th in which 14 people died. Threatening war, it held two Pakistan-based groups--Jaish-e-Muhammad and Lashkar-e-Taiba--responsible. Both had earlier admitted they were conducting guerrilla warfare in Indian-held Kashmir and one had even threatened to carry its attacks to Delhi. General Musharraf ordered the arrest of the leaders of the two groups and scores of their followers when international pressure to crack down on them became unbearable, though he unconvincingly maintains the arrests were not related to Indian accusations.
 ""The iron fist will be revealed soon,"" Major-General Rashid Qureshi, Pakistan's government spokesman, promised this week. He was referring to a planned speech to the nation by General Musharraf over the weekend in which the president is expected to outline stiff measures against religious extremists. Mullahs will not be allowed to use their mosques to preach sectarian hatred or deliver political sermons from the pulpit. Incitement to violence will be strictly dealt with. Military tribunals may even be established to tackle religious terrorism because the judiciary is afraid of taking on the fundamentalists.
 A further idea of what may be in store was provided by General Moinuddin Haider, the interior minister. ""We have decided to bring over 10,000 religious schools and seminaries controlled by the mullahs into the ambit of our mainstream educational system and to subject them to scrutiny,"" he said. ""Every madrassa [religious school] will be asked to furnish details of its income and foreign students."" Mr Haider's brother was assassinated a month ago by unknown terrorists in Karachi, apparently as a warning to him. Even more intriguing, there are reports that General Musharraf has ordered the country's powerful Inter Services Intelligence agency (ISI), which is credited with running covert wars in Afghanistan and Kashmir, to end its backing for Islamic militant groups fighting in Kashmir.
 Hints about the measures that General Musharraf is expected to announce also came from a group of visiting American senators who met the Pakistani president last week. One said the general seemed ready to tackle the scourge of religious extremism. Another thought he was a hero for taking such ""hard and risky"" decisions. An American diplomat said that his forthcoming speech was being billed by government sources as the ""debut of Jinnah II"", a reference to the secular founder of Pakistan, Mohammed Ali Jinnah, whose liberal ideas and modern vision have all but been forgotten by opportunist Pakistani leaders.
 Some observers think it is all too good to be true, noting that most of the reforms have been promised before, and that there have been many false dawns in the past. Others, though, note that the general has no real choice after having sided with the United States over Afghanistan. ""The battle lines are drawn. He must get the mullahs before they get him,"" says one. General Musharraf's personal security has been strengthened. Fortunately for him, no public backlash is expected when he moves to take on the fundamentalists. Most Pakistanis do not like the mullahs, do not vote for their parties in elections and did not in any numbers join the agitation against the government after the American intervention against the Taliban.
 ""The real challenge, however, will come over restructuring the ISI, which has become a state within a state and is running our foreign and domestic policies,"" says a member of General Musharraf's cabinet. But there may be grounds for optimism. According to reliable sources, the general has called a halt to the ISI's external operations, for the time being at least, and got rid of the most belligerent of the old guard. ""The new lot is decidedly liberal and less aggressive than the old one,"" says an insider. Whether all this will persuade India to start peace talks with Pakistan, and move towards a solution to the problem of Kashmir, still remains to be seen.

 AT LAST the Tamil Tigers may be willing to reach an accommodation with the Sri Lankan government to bring peace to the country. Any deal is not likely to be done in a hurry, and there is no certainty that it will be permanent. What is heartening are the signs of a change of mood in the Tigers' leadership that has not been apparent in the past 18 years of civil war.
 The Tigers have been badly wounded; not in a military sense, but diplomatically. Over the past year or two many countries have been losing sympathy with their aim of establishing a separate state in the north and east of the island. In February last year Britain, the former colonial power, shut down the Tigers' office in London. Since the attacks on the United States on September 11th, the Americans and their allies have included the Tigers in the worldwide ragbag of groups regarded as terrorists. In most capitals, the Tigers' sources of money are being tracked down and their bank accounts frozen. The Tigers are desperate to protect the rest of their money, which is mainly collected from sympathisers abroad. They need to strike a deal with the Sri Lankan government that will restore some respectability to their organisation.
 Their change of mood comes at an opportune time for Ranil Wickremesinghe, Sri Lanka's new prime minister, whose coalition, the United National Front, swept to power in December's parliamentary election. As a prelude to hoped-for peace talks, both sides are observing a month-long ceasefire that started on December 24th. As a further gesture, the government has lifted a ban on goods destined for areas controlled by the Tigers.
 At first any talks are unlikely to be attended by the Tigers' leader, Velupillai Prabhakaran. His front man is Anton Balasingham, who, despite Britain's apparently firm line on terrorism, continues to operate in London. This week Mr Balasingham proposed that India should play host to any talks. Madras, he thought, would be a good place for the get-together. India is unlikely to want to be directly involved at this stage. It proscribed the Tigers in 1991, believing that they murdered a former Indian prime minister, Rajiv Gandhi. The present prime minister, Atal Behari Vajpayee, would probably be happy to see Mr Prabhakaran put on trial. Mr Balasingham of course knows this, and his Madras proposal may be a feeler to see whether India, once the Tigers' patron, remains its enemy. Any peace deal giving substantial advantages to the Tigers would have to be approved by India, the regional superpower.
 Norway is likely to be the link to bring the two sides together. An earlier attempt by Norway, when the previous Sri Lankan government was in power, to be the peacemaker ended in failure. But the Norwegians are prepared to try again. A team led by Norway's deputy foreign minister, Vidar Helgesen, arrived in Colombo on January 9th. Norway's interest in a peaceful Sri Lanka is not wholly altruistic. Norsk Hydro, a Norwegian oil and gas company, has a 67% stake in Ceylon Oxygen, whose products include industrial gases and medical equipment. Ceylon Oxygen used to be a state-run concern. Under the Norwegians it is one of the fastest growing companies in Sri Lanka. Norwegians now hope to win a contact in Sri Lanka to build and run a fuel-storage plant for aircraft. It may be just coincidence that the Norwegian peace delegation arrived on the day that a seminar to promote Norwegian business and investment began in Colombo.
 The Norwegians need every encouragement. The Tigers have not dropped their demand for a separate state for Tamils, although these days Mr Prabhakaran prefers to talk of a Tamil ""homeland"" rather than separatism. But whatever it is called, they must be aware that no Sri Lankan government would allow a slab of territory to operate entirely out of its control. A degree of autonomy is what has been proposed in the past. The best that the Tigers can hope for in the near future is that the government will lift the present ban on anyone belonging to or supporting the organisation. The proscription of the formally named Liberation Tigers of Tamil Ealam was declared by the Sri Lankan government in 1998. It had been one of the curiosities of the civil war that for many years no such ban was imposed. Over a long period the Tigers controlled the Jaffna peninsula in the north and ran the civil administration in Jaffna town.
 Even this concession may be difficult for the Buddhists, three- quarters of the population, to stomach. The government does not want peace talks to start until local-government elections, due on March 1st, are out of the way. Meanwhile, the Norwegians and everyone else with goodwill towards Sri Lanka will hope that the ceasefire will be prolonged beyond the end of this month, and well into the future.

 HIS supporters sometimes call him the second Jinnah, meaning that Pervez Musharraf is the man to re-found Pakistan, restore it to its original secular traditions and purge it of the corruption that has brought the country to its knees, and of the extremists that have brought it to the brink of war with India over disputed Kashmir (see pages 21-23). Such talk is an exaggeration: military dictators, after all, tend to attract sycophants. But since September 11th, this one has found the courage to side unequivocally with America against the Taliban regime in Afghanistan, and now to call a halt to the Talibanisation of Pakistan. He knows that Pakistan's survival is at stake.
 His speech on January 12th, nominally to the nation, but in reality also to India and to the world, could well come to be seen as one of the turning-points in Pakistan's brief and unfortunate history. In the bluntest of terms, Mr Musharraf aligned his country with the international mainstream, rejecting terrorism and theocracy, and excoriating those who have perverted Islam for their own ends. Five of the most notorious Islamic groups have now been banned; hundreds of their followers have been rounded up; mosques have been told that they will be monitored and closed down if they allow the pulpit to be used for promoting terror; religious schools are to be brought into the education system.
 Mr Musharraf understands better than anyone how dangerous the Islamic extremists are, and how close they brought Pakistan to disaster with their unsuccessful attempt to blow up India's Parliament last month. ""Every one of us is fed up with it,"" he said, with a military man's directness. And he was right: his speech was applauded across the country. Fears that the army would not support a crackdown are likely to prove as wide of the mark as concerns about the decision to abandon the Taliban. Pakistan's army is nothing if not professional.
 Unwisely conjured into being in the 1980s by General Zia ul-Haq, who flirted recklessly with fundamentalism, the Islamists were nurtured by Pakistan's far-too-powerful Inter-Services Intelligence agency (ISI) throughout the successive weak and corrupt civilian governments of Benazir Bhutto and Nawaz Sharif in the 1990s. Their activities are the reason why Pakistan was increasingly approaching the status of a failed state, a pariah nation the world was ready to give up on. The world is already starting to revise its opinion, as Mr Musharraf's albeit undemocratic political firmness has been matched with competent economic management. At the end of last year, the IMF and the Paris Club of sovereign creditors both pronounced themselves pleased with Pakistan's economic progress, rescheduling much of its debt, and extending fresh credits. Much work remains to be done: Pakistan may be cracking down on the militants themselves, but the general has so far said nothing about purging the ISI, the army, the state-run educational institutes, the judiciary and the civil service of those who have supported, and still support, Islamisation. Until this is done, militant influence will endure.
 Given the world-shaking events occurring in and around his country, it would not have been surprising if Mr Musharraf had taken the opportunity to shelve plans for the restoration of democracy, which he has committed himself to deliver by October. But so far at least he has not, and he and his close associates insist that the deadline will be met. The men in khaki will hardly bow out, though. The general himself will remain as president, a post to which he has no title except might. The government will answer to him, and be dismissed by him. Real power will rest less with parliament than with a beefed-up National Security Council, composed of military men and civilians. If the model sounds reminiscent of Turkey's qualified democracy that is no coincidence. As a child, the future President Musharraf lived for seven years in Ankara, where his father was an embassy attache. Kemal Ataturk's conception of the army as custodian of a secular Islamic democracy must surely appeal to him. Turkey offers a much more attractive model of Islam for Pakistan than do its neighbours, Iran and Afghanistan.
 And then there's Kashmir
 None of this brave experiment will count for anything, however, should Pakistan stumble into war with India. It is a prospect that, thankfully, looks daily more remote, though India has deliberately chosen not to lessen the tension by acknowledging more generously Mr Musharraf's words and deeds. But until India and Pakistan can tackle Kashmir, the root cause of their cross-border animosity, such crises will periodically recur, to the detriment of both countries' stability.
 The outlook there is considerably less cheering. India, as the injured party, seems to be in no mood for negotiation and feels profoundly mistrustful that Pakistan will deliver a genuine end to terrorism. Its soldiers are still spoiling for a fight and its politicians face a sensitive election soon in Uttar Pradesh, the country's largest state, where softness on Pakistan is a sure-fire vote-loser. Behind the relatively moderate figure of the prime minister, Atal Behari Vajpayee, lurk more bellicose ones, such as L. K. Advani, the interior minister.
 Too many Indians subscribe to the view that there are only problems in Kashmir because Pakistan has fomented them. Pakistan does bear a considerable share of the blame. But so, too, does India. It has not ruled Kashmir well, and the root cause of much of the discontent is that it never made good on the undertakings given to Kashmiris at the time of India's independence in 1947, that their accession to India would be confirmed by a plebiscite. Its soldiers have committed appalling human-rights abuses there. It has consistently subverted Kashmiri state governments when they have appeared too sympathetic to separatism, and it has shown no real enthusiasm for a negotiated settlement.
 General Musharraf may be about to confirm the wisdom of the old adage that the worst thing you can do for someone is to grant them their wish. If he does succeed in bringing the terrorists under control, India will lose its best excuse for refusing to tackle the Kashmir question. One day, it might even have to keep its promise of 54 years ago, and let Kashmir vote."," General Musharraf is waging a welcome war at home

 SRINAGAR hardly looks like the capital of a state belonging to the world's largest democracy. Soldiers--helmeted, flak-jacketed and in camouflage--can be seen everywhere, behind sandbags, in open-backed lorries covered by netting against hand grenades, arrayed along pavements like lethal bits of shrubbery. The armour and guns are supposed to protect them from armed insurgents opposed to India's rule in Jammu and Kashmir, its only Muslim-majority state. But the security forces provoke hostility among ordinary Kashmiris that feeds and justifies the insurgency. Nearly every merchant in Srinagar's Maisuma Bazaar claims to have been beaten by them. A man who sells utensils says the security forces arrested him and demanded 100,000 rupees (about $2,100) to let him go. Any provocation turns the bazaar into a battlefield.
 Kashmir has been the cause of two wars between India and Pakistan, in 1947 and in 1965. It is now threatening to cause another, the first since India and Pakistan declared themselves nuclear powers in 1998. On December 13th terrorists attacked India's parliament in an apparent plot to wipe out its leadership. India blamed groups fighting its rule in Kashmir, and Pakistan for harbouring them. It has responded by moving its armed forces into a threatening posture not seen since the last war in 1971 (fought over the breakaway of East Pakistan, now Bangladesh). Pakistan has mobilised in response.
 Tensions have now eased a bit, and Colin Powell, America's secretary of state, hopes to build on that as he visits both countries this week . Under the pressure of India's guns and western diplomacy, Pakistan's self-appointed president, General Pervez Musharraf, went on television on January 12th to denounce religious extremism at home and forswear the use of terrorism to achieve Pakistan's objectives abroad. He banned the two groups India blames for the attack on its parliament, Lashkar-e-Taiba and Jaish-e- Muhammad, and has arrested nearly 2,000 people belonging to those and other groups. India cautiously welcomed General Musharraf's promises and is awaiting further evidence that he intends to carry them out. Meanwhile, its armed forces will remain poised. So tense is the potential front-line that war could well begin by accident.
 It is not obvious why India and Pakistan are prepared to take such risks over a mountainous, landlocked territory with a small population and few natural resources. Kashmir's main asset is the beauty of the Kashmir Valley, which drew tourists until violence in the 1990s drove them away. Investors are equally gun-shy. Agriculture and construction are the mainstays of its economy.
 The state is not of vital strategic significance to India. Pakistan largely satisfied its strategic needs in the first war, when it conquered a third of Kashmir's territory, including the areas closest to Rawalpindi, the headquarters of its army. It is unlikely ever to give up that third, which is nominally independent. Nor do many people seriously dispute India's claim to most of low-lying Jammu, which is inhabited mainly by Hindus, and Buddhist Ladakh. The heart of the conflict is the high Kashmir Valley, inhabited mostly by Muslims, which India is determined to keep.
 Ideology is the germ of the dispute. Pakistan was created in 1947, at a cost of 1m lives, as a homeland for the sub-continent's Muslims. So Kashmir should be ours, say Pakistanis. But if Kashmir's Muslim majority disqualifies it from belonging to India, what becomes of India's identity as a nation based upon shared culture and geography rather than a common religion? The battle between India's ""one- nation"" and Pakistan's ""two-nation"" theories is almost as fierce and as fundamental as that between communism and capitalism.
 Enmeshed in it are struggles between principles more familiar to the rest of the world, which each side uses to press its case. Pakistan's main slogan is ""self-determination"": the people of Jammu and Kashmir have the right to choose which of the two countries to join, a position upheld by non-binding Security Council resolutions. On its side India has democracy (Pakistan is under one-man rule and has been for half its history) and multi-culturalism (Pakistan is avowedly Islamic and has not integrated its own small minority groups).
 Above all, after September 11th, India has the issue of terrorism. The cause of liberating Kashmir from India is kept alive by violence, some of which can only be described as terrorist. Pakistan sponsors such violence by providing refuge and, probably, training and money to the terrorists. India, understandably, is using that sin to bash Pakistan and the whole cause of Kashmiri separatism. Its prime minister, Atal Behari Vajpayee, casts himself as a George Bush on the South Asian front of the international war on terrorism. Unlike Mr Bush, however, Mr Vajpayee cannot go to war without risking the lives of millions of his countrymen.
 The maharajah's bargain
 Despite Pakistan's claims, Muslim Kashmir was not fated to rebel against mainly Hindu India. It opted for India in 1947 because, 100 years before, India's British rulers sold rulership of the Muslim state to a Hindu maharajah for 7.5m rupees ($50m at current prices). When India and Pakistan were split apart, the then-maharajah tried to dodge the obligation of the 562 princely states of the Raj to join one of the two countries. An invasion by Pakistani tribesmen forced his hand: the maharajah acceded to India in return for military help. Pakistan held on to what it had conquered.
 Almost everything about the accession is disputed. Did the maharajah persecute his Muslim subjects? Did the tribesmen leap spontaneously to their defence, or were they agents of Pakistan's new government? Were the British in cahoots with Jawharlal Nehru, Indian's first prime minister, to obtain accession?
 These questions might not have mattered so much if India had continued the policies it started with in Kashmir. In acceding, the maharajah surrendered to India powers in just three areas: defence, foreign affairs and communications. Until 1965 the leader of the state's government was allowed to call himself prime minister. Nehru was eager to get popular ratification for the accession. It was he who brought Pakistan's invasion of Kashmir to the notice of the United Nations, which subsequently called on Pakistan to withdraw its forces in preparation for a plebiscite, which would allow Kashmiris to choose between joining India or Pakistan.
 Nehru had reason to believe that India would win such a plebiscite. Kashmir's pre-eminent leader at the time was Sheikh Muhammad Abdullah, a Muslim who opposed the maharajah's rule but preferred the secular socialism of Nehru's India to the Muslim ideology of Pakistan. He became Kashmir's prime minister in 1948, and could surely have swung a plebiscite India's way. It never happened, partly because the Pakistanis never withdrew and partly because Nehru, feeling that Kashmir was India's anyway, did not see why he should put accession to a vote.
 In 1953, just six years after accession, Sheikh Abdullah was dismissed as prime minister and sent to jail for 11 years on ill- founded suspicions that he was consorting with Pakistan and the United States. Thus began a five-decade fall from grace, during which India progressively integrated Kashmir and alienated it at the same time. In 1957 Kashmir accepted most of the Indian constitution; in 1964 the Indian president's right to dismiss state governments was extended to Kashmir. Sheikh Abdullah made his peace with integration and came back as chief minister in the 1977 elections, the state's first genuinely free ones. But in 1984 his son and successor, Farooq Abdullah, was ousted from power by Indira Gandhi, India's prime minister and Nehru's daughter.
 Kashmiris thus came to associate the central government in Delhi and India's brand of democracy with the thwarting of the popular will. Anti-government groups contested the 1987 state elections under the banner of the Muslim United Front. In some areas their victories were annulled with Delhi's help, returning to power a tamed Farooq Abdullah. The cheated victors became founders of the insurrection. Succour came from Pakistan, which now looked a friendlier partner than India. Although Pakistan does not share Kashmir's culture and has fewer adherents to its Sufist version of Islam, it does profess support for self-determination.
 Sumit Ganguly, who teaches at the University of Texas at Austin, has argued that the insurgency stems from democracy's success in raising popular expectations and its simultaneous failure to build institutions to meet those expectations. This points to the nub of the problem. Most Indians think their democratic constitution, applied faithfully, could provide the liberation Kashmiris seek; to most Kashmiris, that constitution is a prison.
 Who speaks for Kashmir?
 A dozen years of insurgency have left Kashmir with a cast of dazed characters. The Kashmiri people themselves prefer independence to merger with Pakistan but may be (as the Indian government insists) more tired of war than they are eager for either. The militants, who still want a fight, started as a movement of local young men who had ""exfiltrated"" into Pakistan's side of Kashmir for arming and training, became a more lethal force of Pakistanis and other non- Kashmiris acting at Pakistan's bidding, and may now, after Pakistan's crackdown, mutate again. The Kashmiri government, headed by Farooq Abdullah, is deeply unpopular, and must face the voters again this year.
 Separatist politicians, most of them part of the 23-member All- Party Hurriyat Conference, claim to speak for Kashmir's Muslims and probably come closer than anyone else to doing so. But they have yet to test their popularity in elections. Often they are the ventriloquist's dummy for Pakistan, though several would rather have independence than join Pakistan and resent its overbearing role in their struggle. The United States and its allies, which now have troops in the region, are looked upon by many Kashmiris, unrealistically, as potential saviours: when India has finished threatening war, perhaps the big powers can push it to a settlement in Kashmir. Last in this list of actors are the governments of India and Pakistan, the real arbiters of Kashmir's fate.
 Until now, India has vacillated between inaction and ill-fated attempts to talk, either with Pakistan or with the separatists. Two events could now change that pattern. One is the crackdown on terrorism. Most Indians put little trust in General Musharraf's promises, a cynicism fuelled by reports that groups such as Lashkar- e-Taiba are still in business under different names. Indian officials, though, seem hopeful that the crackdown will moderate the militancy. ""A lot of pressure on Pakistan immediately translates itself to Kashmir,"" says a senior Indian official.
 Some speculate that Pakistan will dodge charges of backing cross- border terrorism by shifting support back to mainly Kashmiri outfits, such as Hizbul Mujahideen. That could mean a less lethal militancy, involving fewer suicide attacks and, perhaps, a willingness to talk. Hizbul Mujahideen, or at any rate a faction of it, had announced a short-lived ceasefire in July 2000. India has not spelt out how much and what sort of violence it is prepared to tolerate before demobilising its army and resuming talks with Pakistan. It has demanded an end to ""all infiltration"", but is willing to give General Musharraf ""all due time"" to accomplish this. An end to militant violence could start a hopeful cycle, prompting India to scale back its oppressive 400,000-strong security force in Kashmir, which in turn would lessen the rage that feeds the militants.
 A vital election
 The second event that might bring change is the state election, expected to be held in September. Persuading separatist politicians to participate would be a coup. Candidates proclaim themselves Indians by taking part under the constitution. Demands for secession would thus be converted into less threatening demands for reform within India. The way might then be open to the settlement that many Indian policymakers are thought to favour: the partition of Kashmir into Indian and Pakistani states along the de facto border, called the Line of Control (LoC), plus some degree of autonomy for both sides. Without some separatists, however, the election will be a fiasco: Kashmiri Muslims will mock it again as phoney, and the government it produces will have no mandate to negotiate peace on their behalf.
 The Indian government has made overtures of a sort to the separatists. In 2000 Mr Vajpayee called a unilateral ceasefire during Ramadan, the Muslim holy month, and extended it three times in the hope that the insurgents would respond in kind. They did not, and the ceasefire ended. Mr Vajpayee has promised that Kashmir's next election will be free and fair, and has appointed an intermediary to talk to Kashmiri groups.
 Such efforts are undermined, however, by India's failure to understand how deeply the separatists mistrust it and how vulnerable they are to reprisals by Pakistan and--should they settle too cheaply- -the scorn of Kashmiris themselves. None trusts India's election commission to guarantee the fairness of the forthcoming vote; most want foreign monitors to do that job, a condition they know the Indian government will reject. Separatist leaders suspect every Indian offer may be another betrayal. Yasin Malik, a member of the Hurriyat's executive council, describes the intermediary as ""a clerk who wants to dialogue with 32 parties"", 28 of which are already pro- Indian. Abdul Ghani Lone, another Hurriyat leader, points to the toll of a dozen years of violence: 70,000 Kashmiris dead, he claims (several times the official estimate), 5,000 women ""dishonoured"", 3,000 disappearances. ""How can we participate in elections?"" he asks.
 Many Indian analysts believe that Mr Malik and Mr Lone, who, like most Kashmiris, favour azadi (independence) over merger with Pakistan, would in the end accept some version of ""LoC plus"", Indian shorthand for partition plus autonomy. ""Azadi can be accommodated within India,"" says Amitabh Mattoo of Jawaharlal Nehru University, in Delhi. The harder task may be to persuade Pakistan.
 General Musharraf has conceded much since terrorists attacked America in September. He withdrew support for the Taliban in Afghanistan, and has started to shut down a proxy war against India that is Pakistan's only way of promoting its claim to Kashmir. Yet he has declared that ""Kashmir runs in our blood"" and has called on outside powers to push India into a resolution of the dispute. India rejects outside mediation, as it does a ""triangular"" discussion with Pakistanis and Kashmiris at the same table, because that would suggest that its sovereignty over Kashmir, or at least the part it now controls, is negotiable. India's best offer is, in effect, a more democratic and humane version of the status quo that Pakistan has been fighting for 50 years to overturn.
 Could General Musharraf ever accept this? Indians point to the burden that fighting India has placed on Pakistan's frail economy and to the disfiguring effect on its society of employing Islamic fanatics in that fight. General Musharraf, they hope, would rather modernise Pakistan than continue a futile struggle over Kashmir. Perhaps they are right. But if India is to continue to fly its flag in Srinagar with the consent of Pakistan and the Kashmiri people, democracy and humanity will have to come in torrents. If the drought continues, so will the strife.
Caption: Unpopular Farooq Abdullah","  Pakistan claims Kashmir ; India claims it too . The voices of Kashmiris themselves are hardest to hear 
  SRINAGAR hardly looks like the capital of a state belonging to the world 's largest democracy . Soldiers -- helmeted , flak - jacketed and in camouflage -- can be seen everywhere , behind sandbags , in open - backed lorries covered by netting against hand grenades , arrayed along pavements like lethal bits of shrubbery . The armour and guns are supposed to protect them from armed insurgents opposed to India 's rule in Jammu and Kashmir , its only Muslim - majority state . But the security forces provoke hostility among ordinary Kashmiris that feeds and justifies the insurgency . Nearly every merchant in Srinagar 's Maisuma Bazaar claims to have been beaten by them . A man who sells utensils says the security forces arrested him and demanded 100,000 rupees ( about $ 2,100 ) to let him go . Any provocation turns the bazaar into a battlefield . 
  Kashmir has been the cause of two wars between India and Pakistan , in 1947 and in 1965 . It is now threatening to cause another , the first since India and Pakistan declared themselves nuclear powers in 1998 . On December 13th terrorists attacked India 's parliament in an apparent plot to wipe out its leadership . India blamed groups fighting its rule in Kashmir , and Pakistan for harbouring them . It has responded by moving its armed forces into a threatening posture not seen since the last war in 1971 ( fought over the breakaway of East Pakistan , now Bangladesh ) . Pakistan has mobilised in response . 
  Tensions have now eased a bit , and Colin Powell , America 's secretary of state , hopes to build on that as he visits both countries this week . Under the pressure of India 's guns and western diplomacy , Pakistan 's self - appointed president , General Pervez Musharraf , went on television on January 12th to denounce religious extremism at home and forswear the use of terrorism to achieve Pakistan 's objectives abroad . He banned the two groups India blames for the attack on its parliament , Lashkar - e - Taiba and Jaish - e- Muhammad , and has arrested nearly 2,000 people belonging to those and other groups . India cautiously welcomed General Musharraf 's promises and is awaiting further evidence that he intends to carry them out . Meanwhile , its armed forces will remain poised . So tense is the potential front - line that war could well begin by accident . 
  It is not obvious why India and Pakistan are prepared to take such risks over a mountainous , landlocked territory with a small population and few natural resources . Kashmir 's main asset is the beauty of the Kashmir Valley , which drew tourists until violence in the 1990s drove them away . Investors are equally gun - shy . Agriculture and construction are the mainstays of its economy . 
  The state is not of vital strategic significance to India . Pakistan largely satisfied its strategic needs in the first war , when it conquered a third of Kashmir 's territory , including the areas closest to Rawalpindi , the headquarters of its army . It is unlikely ever to give up that third , which is nominally independent . Nor do many people seriously dispute India 's claim to most of low - lying Jammu , which is inhabited mainly by Hindus , and Buddhist Ladakh . The heart of the conflict is the high Kashmir Valley , inhabited mostly by Muslims , which India is determined to keep . 
  Ideology is the germ of the dispute . Pakistan was created in 1947 , at a cost of 1 m lives , as a homeland for the sub - continent 's Muslims . So Kashmir should be ours , say Pakistanis . But if Kashmir 's Muslim majority disqualifies it from belonging to India , what becomes of India 's identity as a nation based upon shared culture and geography rather than a common religion ? The battle between India 's "" one- nation "" and Pakistan 's "" two - nation "" theories is almost as fierce and as fundamental as that between communism and capitalism . 
  Enmeshed in it are struggles between principles more familiar to the rest of the world , which each side uses to press its case . Pakistan 's main slogan is "" self - determination "" : the people of Jammu and Kashmir have the right to choose which of the two countries to join , a position upheld by non - binding Security Council resolutions . On its side India has democracy ( Pakistan is under one - man rule and has been for half its history ) and multi - culturalism ( Pakistan is avowedly Islamic and has not integrated its own small minority groups ) . 
  Above all , after September 11th , India has the issue of terrorism . The cause of liberating Kashmir from India is kept alive by violence , some of which can only be described as terrorist . Pakistan sponsors such violence by providing refuge and , probably , training and money to the terrorists . India , understandably , is using that sin to bash Pakistan and the whole cause of Kashmiri separatism . Atal Bihari Vajpayee's , casts Atal Bihari Vajpayee as a George Bush on the South Asian front of the international war on terrorism . Unlike Mr Bush , however , Atal Bihari Vajpayee can not go to war without risking the lives of millions of Atal Bihari Vajpayee's countrymen . 
  The maharajah 's bargain 
  Despite Pakistan 's claims , Muslim Kashmir was not fated to rebel against mainly Hindu India . It opted for India in 1947 because , 100 years before , India 's British rulers sold rulership of the Muslim state to a Hindu maharajah for 7.5 m rupees ( $ 50 m at current prices ) . When India and Pakistan were split apart , the then - maharajah tried to dodge the obligation of the 562 princely states of the Raj to join one of the two countries . An invasion by Pakistani tribesmen forced his hand : the maharajah acceded to India in return for military help . Pakistan held on to what it had conquered . 
  Almost everything about the accession is disputed . Did the maharajah persecute his Muslim subjects ? Did the tribesmen leap spontaneously to their defence , or were they agents of Pakistan 's new government ? Were the British in cahoots with Jawharlal Nehru , Indian 's first prime minister , to obtain accession ? 
  These questions might not have mattered so much if India had continued the policies it started with in Kashmir . In acceding , the maharajah surrendered to India powers in just three areas : defence , foreign affairs and communications . Until 1965 the leader of the state 's government was allowed to call himself prime minister . Nehru was eager to get popular ratification for the accession . It was he who brought Pakistan 's invasion of Kashmir to the notice of the United Nations , which subsequently called on Pakistan to withdraw its forces in preparation for a plebiscite , which would allow Kashmiris to choose between joining India or Pakistan . 
  Nehru had reason to believe that India would win such a plebiscite . Kashmir 's pre - eminent leader at the time was Sheikh Muhammad Abdullah , a Muslim who opposed the maharajah 's rule but preferred the secular socialism of Nehru 's India to the Muslim ideology of Pakistan . He became Kashmir 's prime minister in 1948 , and could surely have swung a plebiscite India 's way . It never happened , partly because the Pakistanis never withdrew and partly because Nehru , feeling that Kashmir was India 's anyway , did not see why he should put accession to a vote . 
  In 1953 , just six years after accession , Sheikh Abdullah was dismissed as prime minister and sent to jail for 11 years on ill- founded suspicions that he was consorting with Pakistan and the United States . Thus began a five - decade fall from grace , during which India progressively integrated Kashmir and alienated it at the same time . In 1957 Kashmir accepted most of the Indian constitution ; in 1964 the Indian president 's right to dismiss state governments was extended to Kashmir . Sheikh Abdullah made his peace with integration and came back as chief minister in the 1977 elections , the state 's first genuinely free ones . But in 1984 his son and successor , Farooq Abdullah , was ousted from power by Indira Gandhi , India 's prime minister and Nehru 's daughter . 
  Kashmiris thus came to associate the central government in Delhi and India 's brand of democracy with the thwarting of the popular will . Anti - government groups contested the 1987 state elections under the banner of the Muslim United Front . In some areas their victories were annulled with Delhi 's help , returning to power a tamed Farooq Abdullah . The cheated victors became founders of the insurrection . Succour came from Pakistan , which now looked a friendlier partner than India .

 IN NO democracy is the high calling of government immune from contamination by the rough trade of politics, but in India the contrast is unusually stark. Government's prim face this week was that of Yashwant Sinha, the finance minister, who on February 28th presented to Parliament a budget that struggles to speed up a faltering economy without expanding a deficit that is already ruinous. Meanwhile, freshly elected politicians in India's biggest state pondered whether to defect from their own parties to break an electoral stalemate, tempted, it is said, by cash offers starting at 10m rupees (about $200,000).
 There is a connection. The elections in Uttar Pradesh and three other states in February were a disaster for the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), the party that leads the national coalition government in Delhi and to which Mr Sinha belongs. On top of that comes another crisis: on February 27th a mob attacked a train carrying Hindu activists home from Ayodhya, where they had taken part in a controversial campaign to build a temple on the site of a mosque demolished by Hindus ten years ago. At least 50 died. The prime minister, Atal Behari Vajpayee, cancelled a trip to Australia and told the temple builders to desist. The Hindu groups, which have close links to the Hindu-nationalist BJP, have refused. A confrontation might distract attention from the BJP's electoral humiliation. But it might also sap the political energy required for reforms. Without them, the economy will continue to slow down.
 Disaster still seems distant, but that is part of the problem. This year's good monsoon perked up agriculture and the economy overall, raising the growth of GDP from a dismal 4% last year to an estimated 5.4% in the fiscal year ending on March 31st. India can still boast of having one of the world's fastest growing economies. Wholesale price inflation is barely above 1%. India has little external debt, a current-account deficit of less than 1% of GDP and $50 billion of foreign-exchange reserves.
 But all is by no means well. GDP leapt after a burst of reforms in the early 1990s but, as the finance ministry's new economic survey admits, ""There has been an unmistakable slowdown in subsequent years."" Industry is weighed down by expensive power, high real interest rates and rigid labour practices. Agriculture is trapped by outmoded rules; this year's recovery was a stroll in the prison yard. Behind many of these ills lies bad budgeting of various sorts, from inefficient tax collection to overstaffing to subsidies of food and electricity. Some wonder whether India is heading for a ""growth crisis"", which might trigger another burst of reform.
 That burst did not come in Mr Sinha's budget. That is partly because he is intent on putting into effect and extending reforms already announced, as he should be. Thus he removed 50 more items from the list of industries that are not allowed to grow beyond a certain size. The ""peak"" customs rate has been brought down further, from 35% to 30%. Fertiliser and fuel subsidies were pared. The target for privatisation proceeds is an ambitious 120 billion rupees. In reform-starved areas such as electricity and agriculture it is the states that must take the lead. Mr Sinha sought to cajole them into doing so by linking central government aid to reforms.
 The tax and spend side of the budget is what caught most people's eye. Spending on roads, railways and other infrastructure is to go up substantially. So are taxes: there is to be a net 3% surcharge in income taxes and a tax on dividends was reintroduced. But Mr Sinha's measures will do little to curb the fiscal deficit, which is pushing public debt to unaffordable levels and keeping interest rates high. It is to be an appalling 5.7% of GDP this year; next year's target calls for only a modest drop, to 5.3%.
 The politics of caution
 Mr Sinha's caution may owe something to the drubbing his party has just endured: with an unwieldy and increasingly fractious coalition to manage, the chances of getting tough measures through Parliament are diminishing. The BJP held power or a share of it in all four states that held elections in February. In all cases they lost it. Defeat stings most in Uttar Pradesh, where the BJP was knocked into third place (not counting its allies) by the unexpectedly strong showing of the Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP), which appeals mainly to Dalits (formerly called untouchables). It lost almost half its seats.
 The BJP could yet cling to power in Uttar Pradesh. The apparent winner, the Samajwadi Party, cannot form a government on its own and does not have enough natural allies to form a coalition. In theory it could join forces with the BSP, but many Dalits are at odds with the middle castes that make up the bulk of the Samajwadi Party's support and the two parties' leaders hate each other. The Samajwadi Party is expected to try poaching a group of BSP legislators rather than embracing the party as a whole. If that fails, the state may be run by its governor for several months. Eventually, the upper-caste- dominated BJP and the Dalit-led BSP, odd but willing bed-fellows under the right circumstances, might form a government.
 That might not help the BJP much in Delhi, though. The rebuff in Uttar Pradesh makes Mr Vajpayee, the moderate face of his Hindu- nationalist party, look very feeble, though his 18 allies in the ruling coalition are unlikely to defect soon, because that would mean aligning with the opposition Congress party, their rival in many states, or facing a new election. ""Nothing dramatic will happen,"" predicts Salman Khurshid, a leader of the Congress party, but ""under the surface cracks will appear.""
 The problem for India is that Mr Sinha and other reformers in the government still have so much to do. The widening political cracks, however, now threaten to cut the ground from beneath their feet.","  A series of setbacks for India 's ruling Bharatiya Janata Party means that the chances of real economic reform are starting to recede

 IN THE end, a degree of sanity prevailed. The militant Hindus who had vowed to breach a police cordon and start the work of building a temple to the god Ram at the disputed site of Ayodhya decided to respect a Supreme Court decision barring them from the area. So charged have Hindu-Muslim relations in India become in recent weeks, as the declared deadline of March 15th neared, that a clash at Ram's supposed birthplace might well have provoked bloodshed on an appalling scale across the nation. It has, unfortunately, happened often enough before.
 But the threat has not vanished. The court's decision is only an interim one, and the main Hindu groups have not given up on their quest to build their temple. Extreme religious violence, which seemed in recent years to have faded after the Ayodhya-related explosion of 1992-93, is again a feature of the political landscape. Though faults lie on both sides (it was a Muslim attack on Hindus in a train in Gujarat that started the recent slaughter), the great bulk of victims were, as always, Muslims. Once again, educated Hindus are to be heard inveighing against the ""appeasing"" of Muslims through such concessions as separate constitutional status for Kashmir or the right to practise Islamic civil law. Once again, the police are being accused of doing little or nothing to help Muslim victims of rampaging Hindu mobs. Once again, India's 130m Muslims feel unequal and unsafe in their own country. Far too many Hindus would refuse to accept that it is ""their own country"" at all.
 The wonder of it, perhaps, is that things are not worse. While the world applauds Pakistan for at last locking up the leaders of its extreme religious groups, in India the zealots still support, sustain and to a degree constitute the government. The BJP, which leads the ruling coalition, was founded as a political front for the Hindu movement. It is simply one, and by no means the dominant, member of what is called the Sangh Pariwar, the ""family of organisations"". Other members of the family are much less savoury. There is the VHP, the World Hindu Organisation, which led the movement to build the Ram temple. There is the Bajrang Dal, the brutalist ""youth wing"" of the VHP. There is substantial evidence that members of the VHP and the Bajrang Dal helped to organise the slaughter of hundreds of Muslims in Gujarat after 58 Hindus were killed on a train as they returned from Ayodhya.
 And there is the RSS, a militaristic mass organisation of Hindus whose members drill in khaki at sunrise, and salute the saffron flag. It was a former RSS member, Nathuram Godse, who assassinated Mahatma Gandhi for ""betraying"" India by permitting the creation of Pakistan. The RSS passed a repugnant resolution only last weekend, declaring that the safety of India's Muslims depended on the goodwill of the majority--rather than, say, the rule of law. Most of the BJP's top people, including its moderate leader and prime minister, Atal Behari Vajpayee, have been members of the RSS. In few other democracies is the ruling party so explicitly associated with such unacceptable partners.
 Mr Vajpayee's defenders often claim that he would like nothing better than to ditch the VHP and the Bajrang Dal, and turn the BJP into a modern, secular party. Perhaps: but there is too little evidence of his trying to do it, and even less of his succeeding. Indeed, there are good grounds for worrying that the reverse is true. Faltering in the polls, and having just lost control of Uttar Pradesh, India's largest state, the BJP faces the loss of Gujarat, its last stronghold, in elections next year. Powerful voices within the party insist that the reason for this is that the party has gone soft on its agenda of Hindutva--Hinduness. To them, the solution is obvious: shout about issues such as Ayodhya and bait the Muslims whenever possible. The dismal consequences can be seen on the streets.
 The BJP rode to power in the early 1990s on a tide of religious bigotry, exploiting the Ayodhya issue for electoral gain. One of its senior figures, L.K. Advani, made the Ram campaign his own, and used to give speeches beneath a flag that showed India as a single saffron block--with pre-Partition boundaries and Pakistan swallowed up inside ""India"". Mr Advani is now India's home-affairs minister, and presumptive successor to the ailing Mr Vajpayee. As such, he is responsible for the rule of law in India. After Gujarat, he should be leading a drive to crack down on the people who organised the atrocities.

 HERE is an irony: India's ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) has for several years seemed to treat its Hindu-nationalist ideology as a political liability. Now, when that ideology is showing its dangerous and shameful side, the party has suddenly chosen to reaffirm it. Little more than a month ago, Hindu mobs in Gujarat, a BJP-ruled state, slaughtered hundreds of Muslims. The atrocities began as revenge for an attack by Muslims on a train carrying Hindu pilgrims, in which 58 people burnt to death. More than 800 people have died in violence that still has not ended.
 Last weekend, at a meeting of its executive body in Goa, the BJP not only rejected opposition calls for the sacking of Gujarat's chief minister, who seems to care more for the mainly Hindu murderers than the mainly Muslim victims, but invited him to hold early elections in the state, in effect capitalizing on the carnage. India's prime minister, Atal Behari Vajpayee, whose reputation for tolerance makes the BJP acceptable to most of its 18 coalition partners, shocked India by echoing those who blame Muslims for the violence against them. The massacres are ""condemnable"", he said, ""but who lit the fire and how did it spread?""
 This is a turning point. During its four years in government the BJP has been deferential to fellow members of the National Democratic Alliance, smothering its ideology of Hindutva (""Hinduness"") lest they walk out of the government. Most of the coalition members solicit Muslim votes and have more in common with the ""secular"" opposition than they do with the BJP. The BJP is not ready to part company with them yet, but the deference is falling away. Winning the next series of elections, culminating in the general election to be held by autumn 2004, has become as important as shoring up the coalition.
 The new assertiveness looks to have passed its first test. The alliance's biggest backer, the Telugu Desam Party of Andhra Pradesh, a southern state, threatened to pull out unless the BJP sacked Narendra Modi, Gujarat's chief minister. The BJP said no, perhaps its boldest rebuff yet to a parliamentary ally.
 The BJP has votes to spare. This week it agreed to let a party representing mainly Dalits (formerly called Untouchables) rule in Uttar Pradesh, the biggest state, in exchange for its support at the centre. The Telugu Desam Party is apparently having second thoughts about pulling out; like other coalition members, it is loth to chance elections or to join forces with Congress, its main rival in Andhra Pradesh. The campaign to oust Mr Modi may now be confined to the opposition, which is paralysing parliament but cannot topple the government. Analysts expect the coalition to stumble on for a while longer, though perhaps not to its full term.
 The electoral test may be tougher, though. The BJP has lost a string of state and municipal elections, most recently in Uttar Pradesh and Delhi. Until the horrors of Gujarat, it was set to lose there too. The home minister, L. K. Advani, said in Goa that the BJP had been ""needlessly apologetic"" about its ideology. In future, he suggested, the BJP would sound two themes: the ensemble music of the National Democratic Alliance and its own brassy solo, ""enlightened cultural nationalism"".
 This may work in Gujarat. According to a poll, 52% of urban Gujaratis now expect the BJP to win. There is less chance it will succeed in less polarised states, such as Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan, which are to hold elections next year. And the odds look even longer for the general election, in which the BJP needs allies to win. ""Cultural nationalism"" sounds harmless, maybe even admirable, but not in the mouths of those who find excuses for the pogroms in Gujarat.

The BJP is not ready to part company with them yet , but the deference is falling away . Winning the next series of elections , culminating in the general election to be held by autumn 2004 , has become as important as shoring up the coalition . 
  The new assertiveness looks to have passed its first test . The alliance 's biggest backer , the Telugu Desam Party of Andhra Pradesh , a southern state , threatened to pull out unless the BJP sacked Narendra Modi , Gujarat 's chief minister . The BJP said no , perhaps its boldest rebuff yet to a parliamentary ally . 
  The BJP has votes to spare . This week it agreed to let a party representing mainly Dalits ( formerly called Untouchables ) rule in Uttar Pradesh , the biggest state , in exchange for its support at the centre . The Telugu Desam Party is apparently having second thoughts about pulling out ; like other coalition members , it is loth to chance elections or to join forces with Congress , its main rival in Andhra Pradesh . The campaign to oust Mr Modi may now be confined to the opposition , which is paralysing parliament but can not topple the government . Analysts expect the coalition to stumble on for a while longer , though perhaps not to its full term . 
  The electoral test may be tougher , though . The BJP has lost a string of state and municipal elections , most recently in Uttar Pradesh and Delhi . Until the horrors of Gujarat , it was set to lose there too . The home minister , L. K. Advani , said in Goa that the BJP had been "" needlessly apologetic "" about its ideology . In future , he suggested , the BJP would sound two themes : the ensemble music of the National Democratic Alliance and its own brassy solo , "" enlightened cultural nationalism "" . 
  This may work in Gujarat . According to a poll , 52 % of urban Gujaratis now expect the BJP to win . There is less chance it will succeed in less polarised states , such as Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan , which are to hold elections next year . And the odds look even longer for the general election , in which the BJP needs allies to win . "" Cultural nationalism "" sounds harmless , maybe even admirable , but not in the mouths of those who find excuses for the pogroms in Gujarat .

 ""IT IS just this type of barbarism that the international war on terrorism is determined to stop."" So said Christina Rocca, the top American diplomat for South Asia, of the killing on May 14th of 31 people, most of them soldiers' wives and children, at an army camp in Kaluchak in the Indian state of Jammu and Kashmir. It is also the sort of attack that India has given warning would provoke retaliation against Pakistan, which could spark the first war between nuclear powers.
 Mrs Rocca was already shuttling between the Indian and Pakistani capitals to head off such a war. India's army has been mobilised along its border with Pakistan since December, after a terrorist attack on its parliament. The military threat, coupled with international pressure on Pakistan's president, Pervez Musharraf, was supposed to curtail attacks on India originating from Pakistan. Mrs Rocca's mission may be one of the last chances for this ""coercive diplomacy"" to work.
 It had seemed to be working, for a while. General Musharraf banned several violent Islamist outfits, including groups fighting Indian rule in Kashmir, arrested their leaders and froze their accounts. In January he pledged to crack down on extremism and to prevent terrorists from using Pakistan as a staging post for attacks on India. The Indians never believed him and now, they say, evidence of his perfidy is in. General Musharraf has released three out of every four people he arrested. Terrorist camps have been re- established in the part of Kashmir controlled by Pakistan, with some 3,000 inmates, say Indian officials: their infiltration into Indian Kashmir has not slowed down since last year, and is sure to speed up once snow melts from the mountain passes. And now terrorists have staged the bloodiest attack since Kashmir's parliament was bombed in October.
 There are two ways to avoid retaliation: General Musharraf could convince India that he is serious about reining in the terrorists, or India could continue to answer terrorism with what will come to look like empty threats. General Musharraf may lack either the power or the inclination to do the first; the humiliation of the second is becoming unbearable to India. Its government, looking feeble after mishandling massacres of hundreds of Muslims in the western state of Gujarat, is under increasing pressure to act. The prime minister, Atal Behari Vajpayee, said that India ""will have to counter"" the massacre, but did not say how or when.
 Pakistan has long embraced the cause of freeing Kashmir, India's only Muslim-majority state, from Indian rule while claiming (unbelievably) that it gives only diplomatic and moral support to anti-Indian militants. September 11th and its aftermath twisted that alliance in ways not fully understood. General Musharraf made enemies among jihadi groups by backing the American war against terrorism. He appointed a new chief of the ISI intelligence agency, the main patron of anti-Indian groups, in part to be able to control them. Pakistani analysts reckon attacks such as this week's, possibly assisted by rogue ISI operatives, are directed as much at General Musharraf's rule in Pakistan as they are at India's rule in Kashmir.
 Yet the general also has reasons not to crack down too hard. One is to avoid making terrorists angrier than they already are. Another is that India plans to hold ""free and fair"" elections in Kashmir by the autumn and is trying to entice moderate separatists to participate. If turnout is high and the elected government looks popular, India will no doubt declare that Kashmiris have accepted their lot. Earlier this month General Musharraf described attacks on Indian forces (but not on civilians) as part of a ""legitimate freedom struggle,"" a definition that enrages India.
 He fires from behind multiple shields. Would India attack the Americans' chief ally in the war against al-Qaeda? Pakistan has already complained that India's deployment is diverting its army from that fight. If war starts, many Pakistanis think the United States will step in to stop it. Would India really risk taking on a nuclear-armed adversary? Pakistan has repeatedly stated its willingness to go nuclear in response to a conventional attack.
 But the price of Indian restraint rises with each outrage; the cost of retribution, meanwhile, is starting to look acceptable. Indian strategic thinkers have recently argued that India can wage a ""limited war"" against Pakistan without risking a nuclear exchange. This, they say, is because the adversaries understand each other: India would not push Pakistan so hard that it had to resort to nuclear weapons, and vice-versa. Besides, if Pakistan did deploy its nuclear missiles, says K. Subrahmanyam, a leading strategist, the United States ""would destroy them."" All this sounds to many like dangerously wishful thinking.
 If it gives up on diplomacy, India's likeliest course would be to mount ""surgical"" raids on terrorist camps in Pakistan-controlled Kashmir, which is not formally part of Pakistan. But the risk of escalation is always present. V. R. Raghavan, a former director- general of Indian military operations, argued in a recent paper that any conflict between India and Pakistan could easily spiral out of control. India's aggressive plans for fighting conventional wars are now matched against Pakistan's aggressive doctrine for nuclear ones. An ""escalation from a conventional to a nuclear war, within one or two days of the outbreak of the war, is not implausible,"" General Raghavan writes.
 Indian leaders are aware of such risks, and pray that Mrs Rocca's mission will provide some escape. They are not hopeful.

 HAS Pakistan blinked again? In the past ten days, after a series of particularly ugly attacks, India's war preparations have moved into higher gear. On May 22nd the prime minister, Atal Behari Vajpayee, told soldiers near the front line in the disputed state of Jammu and Kashmir, to prepare for a ""decisive battle"". The first war between nuclear-armed powers looked imminent.
 Hours after Mr Vajpayee's threat Pakistan repeated a promise it made in January, the last time India appeared to be on the verge of attacking. ""No organisation in Pakistan will be allowed to indulge in terrorism in the name of Kashmir,"" the government said. Will India now pull its troops back to peacetime positions? Will the two countries at last begin resolving their dispute over Kashmir, which has poisoned their relations and triggered two wars? Not yet. Mr Vajpayee's initial reaction was to demand deeds, not words.
 And so, until India is convinced, Mr Vajpayee's threat stands. It reverberates far beyond Pakistan. India has no wish for a full- scale war, but the sort of punitive operation it has in mind could turn into one. That would present the gravest risk yet of a nuclear strike by one nuclear-armed power against another. The United States and other outside powers would not be merely bystanders. The United States (though it refuses to confirm this) is said to have hundreds of troops hunting down remnants of al-Qaeda, including perhaps Osama bin Laden himself, in Pakistan. Pakistan's army is helping them. Their mission would be jeopardised by any Indo-Pakistani war. The consequences for the brittle regime of Pakistan's president, Pervez Musharraf, whom the United States sees as the most reliable bulwark available against anti-American terrorists in the region, are incalculable.
 All this gives the outside world a large stake in heading off war. Its emissaries can make a difference if they persuade Pakistan to end its sponsorship of ""cross-border terrorism"" and persuade India that Pakistan means it. But India's indignation is so intense, and the attacks against it so dastardly, that the would-be peacemakers may not arrive in time.
 The latest outrage was the killing on May 21st of Abdul Gani Lone, the most moderate of the Kashmiri leaders demanding independence from India (see box on next page). No group has taken responsibility for the killing, which Pakistan and India have blamed on each other. To India, though, it is a blow. Many Indians admit that they have misgoverned their only Muslim-majority state, and that the militancy which broke out at the end of the 1980s has its roots in the justifiable grievances of ordinary Kashmiris.
 The government has been promising, in effect, to make amends. Mr Vajpayee has said that the state elections due in the autumn will be ""free and fair"", a tacit admission that earlier elections were not. He had hoped that moderate separatists like Mr Lone would participate, or at least use the occasion to open talks with the government about a settlement short of secession. After his slaying, presumably by Islamic militants, who would dare?
 The murder occurred a week after terrorists killed more than 30 people, mostly soldiers' wives and children, at an army camp in Jammu. Smaller assaults have filled the intervening days. Such attacks seem to be aimed at disrupting the forthcoming elections. They also indicate that, despite recent splits among some anti- Indian militias, terrorists can operate freely in the state. To India they are appalling proof that its internal affairs are at the mercy of murderous fanatics.
 The general and the terrorists
 India has no doubt that these attacks originate in Pakistan with at least the tacit consent of General Musharraf. He had promised to crack down on anti-Indian terrorists after they attacked India's parliament on December 13th, prompting India to mobilise its army and threaten retaliation. Since then, say the Indians, terrorist camps have reappeared in the part of Kashmir controlled by Pakistan, and the level of violence on India's side has returned to its former intensity.
 General Musharraf may not be guilty of all the charges against him. The most vicious attacks look as if they are aimed at provoking a war, which the Pakistani president does not want, as well as derailing Kashmir's election, which he would presumably welcome. But India is probably right to believe that Pakistan, at least until this week, saw the militants more as assets than as liabilities. The United States, normally eager to cast its staunchest ally in the war on terrorism in as favourable a light as possible, admits in its annual report on terrorism, published this week, that questions remain about whether Pakistan will honour fully its pledge to oppose terrorism against India.
 Pakistan must now lay those questions to rest. The government's renewal of its promise to do so shows that it takes India's threats of reprisal seriously. Pakistani analysts now expect General Musharraf to follow up immediately by shutting down the camps and blocking infiltration into India's side of Kashmir. This may be something short of an irrevocable break with jihadi militants, who have been the mainstay of Pakistan's half-century-long campaign to claim all Kashmir for itself. But it might persuade India to withdraw its troops from the border and open negotiations. On the other hand, if India fights, the terrorists could be dispatched by Pakistan into India en masse.
 India's war aims would be, as one military analyst put it, to ""raise the cost"" to Pakistan of supporting ""cross-border terrorism"". The probable means would be an attack aimed directly at the problem: the camps on Pakistan's side of Kashmir, which harbour the militants who sneak across the mountains--with the help of Pakistan's army-- and into Indian Kashmir. This might take the form of quick raids, either by air or by teams of ground commandos. A more ambitious tactic would be to capture ground on Pakistan's side of the Line of Control (LoC) to interdict terrorists before they get across.
 Both strategies would have the virtue of confining the hostilities to what Pakistan calls ""Azad (free) Kashmir"", which it regards as disputed ground rather than as an integral part of its own territory. India would hope to inflict on Pakistan a stinging but local defeat. ""We will impose a cost in PoK [Pakistan Occupied Kashmir] and leave the onus of escalation in the international border"" (between India and Pakistan proper) to General Musharraf, advises K.K. Nayyar, a retired admiral.
 The risks are great. One is that raids on terrorist camps, which are close to where people live, could end up killing many civilians. Aeroplanes, too, can be shot down. The bigger risk is that one of the combatants will expand the conflict beyond Kashmir. Pakistan's military chiefs think they have the advantage there. They would hit back with the air force or seize territory somewhere on India's side of the Line of Control. Faced with defeat in a targeted offensive, India would then be the one to open a new front along the international border. That is where India's army can hope to beat Pakistan. Pakistan might counter-attack in a key Indian state such as Punjab, hoping to provoke international intervention to stop the war. ""We can expect a tough and robust response from Pakistan,"" says a western defence analyst. A general-president who doubts his own popularity and is portrayed as a traitor by radical Islamist groups cannot afford to accept defeat at the hands of an enemy that Pakistanis sometimes despise as much as they fear.
 In desperation, Pakistan could resort to nuclear weapons. India has said that it will not be the first country in a conflict to use them. Pakistan has made no such promise. Indian planners think they know Pakistan's threshold of tolerance; India's war aim would not be to dismember Pakistan as it helped to do in 1971, when Pakistan's eastern wing broke away to become Bangladesh. But does Pakistan believe that, and how long would it wait to find out? India's hawkish home minister, L.K. Advani, said in a newspaper this week that India's government would ""win the proxy war like we did in 1971,"" a reference to Pakistan's India-assisted break-up. Pakistan's strategists are likely to have taken note.","  Once again , Kashmir and terrorism bring two nuclear powers to the edge of war

The consequences for the brittle regime of Pakistan 's president , Pervez Musharraf , whom the United States sees as the most reliable bulwark available against anti - American terrorists in the region , are incalculable . 
  All this gives the outside world a large stake in heading off war . Its emissaries can make a difference if they persuade Pakistan to end its sponsorship of "" cross - border terrorism "" and persuade India that Pakistan means it . But India 's indignation is so intense , and the attacks against it so dastardly , that the would - be peacemakers may not arrive in time . 
  The latest outrage was the killing on May 21st of Abdul Gani Lone , the most moderate of the Kashmiri leaders demanding independence from India ( see box on next page ) . No group has taken responsibility for the killing , which Pakistan and India have blamed on each other . To India , though , it is a blow . Many Indians admit that they have misgoverned their only Muslim - majority state , and that the militancy which broke out at the end of the 1980s has its roots in the justifiable grievances of ordinary Kashmiris . 
  The government has been promising , in effect , to make amends . Atal Bihari Vajpayee has said that the state elections due in the autumn will be "" free and fair "" , a tacit admission that earlier elections were not . Atal Bihari Vajpayee had hoped that moderate separatists like Mr Lone would participate , or at least use the occasion to open talks with the government about a settlement short of secession . After his slaying , presumably by Islamic militants , who would dare ? 
  The murder occurred a week after terrorists killed more than 30 people , mostly soldiers ' wives and children , at an army camp in Jammu . Smaller assaults have filled the intervening days . Such attacks seem to be aimed at disrupting the forthcoming elections . They also indicate that , despite recent splits among some anti- Indian militias , terrorists can operate freely in the state . To India they are appalling proof that its internal affairs are at the mercy of murderous fanatics . 
  The general and the terrorists 
  India has no doubt that these attacks originate in Pakistan with at least the tacit consent of General Musharraf . He had promised to crack down on anti - Indian terrorists after they attacked India 's parliament on December 13th , prompting India to mobilise its army and threaten retaliation . Since then , say the Indians , terrorist camps have reappeared in the part of Kashmir controlled by Pakistan , and the level of violence on India 's side has returned to its former intensity . 
  General Musharraf may not be guilty of all the charges against him . The most vicious attacks look as if they are aimed at provoking a war , which the Pakistani president does not want , as well as derailing Kashmir 's election , which he would presumably welcome . But India is probably right to believe that Pakistan , at least until this week , saw the militants more as assets than as liabilities . The United States , normally eager to cast its staunchest ally in the war on terrorism in as favourable a light as possible , admits in its annual report on terrorism , published this week , that questions remain about whether Pakistan will honour fully its pledge to oppose terrorism against India . 
  Pakistan must now lay those questions to rest . The government 's renewal of its promise to do so shows that it takes India 's threats of reprisal seriously . Pakistani analysts now expect General Musharraf to follow up immediately by shutting down the camps and blocking infiltration into India 's side of Kashmir . This may be something short of an irrevocable break with jihadi militants , who have been the mainstay of Pakistan 's half - century - long campaign to claim all Kashmir for itself . But it might persuade India to withdraw its troops from the border and open negotiations . On the other hand , if India fights , the terrorists could be dispatched by Pakistan into India en masse . 
  India 's war aims would be , as one military analyst put it , to "" raise the cost "" to Pakistan of supporting "" cross - border terrorism "" . The probable means would be an attack aimed directly at the problem : the camps on Pakistan 's side of Kashmir , which harbour the militants who sneak across the mountains -- with the help of Pakistan 's army-- and into Indian Kashmir . This might take the form of quick raids , either by air or by teams of ground commandos . A more ambitious tactic would be to capture ground on Pakistan 's side of the Line of Control ( LoC ) to interdict terrorists before they get across . 
  Both strategies would have the virtue of confining the hostilities to what Pakistan calls "" Azad ( free ) Kashmir "" , which it regards as disputed ground rather than as an integral part of its own territory . India would hope to inflict on Pakistan a stinging but local defeat . "" We will impose a cost in PoK [ Pakistan Occupied Kashmir ] and leave the onus of escalation in the international border "" ( between India and Pakistan proper ) to General Musharraf , advises K.K. Nayyar , a retired admiral . 
  The risks are great . One is that raids on terrorist camps , which are close to where people live , could end up killing many civilians . Aeroplanes , too , can be shot down . The bigger risk is that one of the combatants will expand the conflict beyond Kashmir . Pakistan 's military chiefs think they have the advantage there . They would hit back with the air force or seize territory somewhere on India 's side of the Line of Control . Faced with defeat in a targeted offensive , India would then be the one to open a new front along the international border . That is where India 's army can hope to beat Pakistan . Pakistan might counter - attack in a key Indian state such as Punjab , hoping to provoke international intervention to stop the war . "" We can expect a tough and robust response from Pakistan , "" says a western defence analyst . A general - president who doubts his own popularity and is portrayed as a traitor by radical Islamist groups can not afford to accept defeat at the hands of an enemy that Pakistanis sometimes despise as much as they fear . 
  In desperation , Pakistan could resort to nuclear weapons . India has said that it will not be the first country in a conflict to use them . Pakistan has made no such promise . Indian planners think they know Pakistan 's threshold of tolerance ; India 's war aim would not be to dismember Pakistan as it helped to do in 1971 , when Pakistan 's eastern wing broke away to become Bangladesh . But does Pakistan believe that , and how long would it wait to find out ? India 's hawkish home minister , L.K. Advani , said in a newspaper this week that India 's government would "" win the proxy war like we did in 1971 , "" a reference to Pakistan 's India - assisted break - up . Pakistan 's strategists are likely to have taken note .",750,India,A29-8257,IN TERM,True,"the prime minister , Atal Behari Vajpayee",6,True

 ""THE situation is dangerous, but war is not inevitable."" So pronounced Jack Straw, the British foreign secretary, after visiting the leaders of Pakistan and India this week. It may be true, but his careful words hint at more than mere accuracy. The current leash- straining between the nuclear-armed neighbours may be the right climate for outsiders like Mr Straw to propose lasting solutions. War would wreck the atmosphere: but so, too, might a premature peace that could not stick.
 Mr Straw would not say whether Pakistan had bowed to India's main demand: stopping the terrorism that it visits upon India to undermine its rule of Kashmir. To accuse Pakistan's president, Pervez Musharraf, of failure would invite Indian assault, while to absolve Pakistan would pressure India to pull back its army, now poised to strike Pakistan, before a deal is reached. Mr Straw has now left the region, but America's deputy secretary of state, Richard Armitage, is on his way in to refine the peace proposal, if indeed one really does exist.
 Pakistanis insist that General Musharraf is doing as India demands. It will soon be apparent, they say, that the government has blocked infiltration by anti-Indian militants across the line of control, which divides Kashmir into Indian- and Pakistani- controlled zones. A Pakistani newspaper reports that radio links between militants on either side of the line have been cut. General Musharraf is also said to be dismantling camps for terrorists in Pakistan-administered Kashmir. In return, he expects India's prime minister, Atal Behari Vajpayee, to open talks on Kashmir.
 India, though angry and disbelieving, accepts this deal in principle. If General Musharraf keeps his promises, said Jaswant Singh, India's foreign minister, India will ""reciprocate."" This is what outsiders are pushing for. Apart from their nuclear worries, they are desperate to head off an attack by India on the main frontline ally in the fight against al-Qaeda. As conscientious fighters of terror, they are pushing General Musharraf to act first by cracking down on terrorism.
 Plenty could still go wrong. More terrorism, like the May 14th slaughter of soldiers' wives and children or the December 13th attack on India's parliament, could trigger an Indian reprisal. An attack on an Indian police station on May 30th hardly inspired confidence. General Musharraf condemns such attacks, and claims that they are aimed as much at destabilising his government as at India. Yet even if the next big attack is not the doing of Pakistan's government, India may feel that its credibility depends on punishing, rather than merely admonishing, Pakistan.
 A gap remains between what India demands and what General Musharraf says he will do. India wants the machinery of terrorism shut down for good, not merely put in storage. General Musharraf is unlikely to comply in full.
 One reason is that if war does break out, the machinery will come in handy. General Musharraf told the Washington Post that ""hundreds of thousands"" of people are itching to fight India on its side of Kashmir. A second is that India's mistrust of Pakistan is fully reciprocated. India wants to crush Kashmir's resistance and to destabilise Pakistan, General Musharraf told the Post. He also believes that India wants to remove him personally, and it is true that in Delhi his standing approaches zero. India's demand for the liquidation of the outfits that fight India would, in Pakistan's view, amount to unilateral disarmament. India, meanwhile, would go ahead with elections in Kashmir set for this autumn and call the results an endorsement of its rule, leaving Pakistan in the cold and General Musharraf looking like the dictator who lost Kashmir.
 The general can ill-afford this. True, his regime does not look especially shaky. According to a recent poll commissioned by the American State Department, 72% of urban Pakistanis have confidence in him (or did before a widely derided referendum in April that extended his term as president). A large majority backs his banning of the extremist Islamist groups that have caused havoc inside Pakistan. Most also support the government's management of the economy, though, doses of foreign money apart, it is limping along at best. The polls also show that although support for the militants in Kashmir is still strong it shows signs of slipping.
 But it is not the silent majority that threatens the general's rule. Rather, it is a lethal minority. The most dangerous are the extremists, who regard him as an American stooge for joining the war against the Taliban and will brand him an Indian lackey if he chokes off the militancy in Kashmir. Terrorism within Pakistan itself-- such as the bomb that last month killed 11 French engineers in Karachi and is making multinationals, as well as embassies, think very hard about the safety of their staff--is probably their doing.
 Even more alarming is the growing evidence that members of al- Qaeda, displaced from Afghanistan into Pakistan, have been involved in these attacks. The al-Qaeda remnants are now thought to be in hiding not only in Pakistan's north-western tribal areas, but in many of Pakistan's largest cities, where the potential for harm, if they have linked up with Pakistan's own home-grown militant groups, is immense.
 Pakistan's army is disciplined. But even the army harbours people with similar attitudes to some of the militants. On Kashmir, General Musharraf shares some himself. No Pakistani can contemplate surrendering to India: all worry that India, which dismembered Pakistan in 1971, would love to do it again. Yet India cannot accept Pakistan holding in reserve a terrorist weapon that may again be used to press its suit in Kashmir.
 What is needed now is a sequence of steps to dance Pakistan and India away from the brink without allowing one to trip the other up. Outsiders like Mr Straw and, next week, Mr Armitage can help with the choreography."," Diplomacy is at work to talk India and Pakistan back from the brink

 TO THE West, Pervez Musharraf is the indispensable man. Pakistan's president turned over his former Taliban allies to the coalition against terror and is now helping it hunt down al-Qaeda fighters who may have fled into Pakistan from Afghanistan. Though a dictator, he is a modern sort, seemingly more interested in literacy than in jihad. His is the heartbeat between Pakistan's nuclear weapons and people who think like Osama bin Laden.
 India's view is less rosy. This satrap of the anti-terror coalition masterminds terrorism against India, aimed at wresting Kashmir, a mainly Muslim state, from Indian rule. When India threatens to answer this proxy war with conventional war, by mobilising its army along the border, Pakistan brandishes its nuclear weapons. But even Indians admit that if General Musharraf fell, what came after might be worse.
 Worries about the general's longevity colour almost everything that goes on in the region. They are one reason the West is desperate to head off a war between India and Pakistan, which could lead to the general's downfall. These worries have not deterred outsiders from demanding that he end infiltration by terrorists across the line of control (LoC), which divides Kashmir into Indian and Pakistani zones.
 But they may inhibit the general doing so decisively. He has certainly been an accomplice of the anti-Indian militants, but he is also, potentially, their victim. Peace may depend on whether he fears their ferocity more than India's army and international pressure combined. At the moment, he believes he is doing just enough to keep India at bay. He insists that terrorists are not crossing the LoC.
 India's prime minister, Atal Behari Vajpayee, refused to meet General Musharraf at an Asian summit in Kazakhstan this week. Afterwards, though, he suggested joint patrols of the LoC, a hint of reconciliation. Two high-powered Americans, Richard Armitage, the deputy secretary of state, and Donald Rumsfeld, the defence secretary, were on their way to the region to push General Musharraf to keep the terrorists in check, and to urge India to reciprocate. On Wednesday, George Bush urged the Pakistani and the Indian leaders to, as his spokesman put it, ""step back from the abyss"". But even pleas from the world's most powerful man may not halt the path to war, in part because General Musharraf may not do enough to satisfy India.
 Intelligence sources in India say that Pakistan's Inter-Services Intelligence agency (ISI), which orchestrates the militancy, has merely asked terrorists to lay low for four to six weeks. This will be extended, Pakistanis say, if India responds. The fighters in turn have asked for fresh ammunition, if not fresh blood, for the 3,000 militants already in place in Indian Kashmir. Indian intelligence suspects that hundreds of ""porters"" are poised to bring in new supplies from Pakistan's side.
 Why might General Musharraf risk letting them through? Belief in Pakistan's right to rule Kashmir is the marrow of Pakistani patriotism, and no one is less likely to question that than the chief of an army that exists to achieve it. Then there is the risk that respectable people take when they hire hit-men: the thugs may turn on them. The militants operating in Kashmir are part of an underworld in which jihad-waging men of violence, like al-Qaeda members and their ilk, call them a ""mafia"", consort with worthier sorts, like intelligence men, generals, even scientists.
 General Musharraf has convinced the United States that there is no better man available to shut this mafia down; indications are growing that the mafia would like to get rid of him. Divide and rule is the worried general's current policy for dealing with the mafia. Al-Qaeda and home-grown ""sectarian"" groups, which kill Muslims they disagree with, are to be stamped out, even though they are a source of zealous cannon fodder for Kashmir. Kashmir-oriented groups, meanwhile, are to be handled more tactfully, partly to keep pressure on India and partly to discourage them from making common cause with other jihadi groups.
 The backlash has begun. Recent massacres by extremists at a church in Islamabad and a hotel in Karachi, directed mainly at foreigners, are also a warning to the regime. If the Kashmir contingent joined them, General Musharraf could face graver threats. The crunch will come if and when India offers a reasonable solution to the Kashmir dispute. The jihadis are likely to reject it, and the general will have to decide whether to drive them out of business and into the arms of other extremists or to prolong the conflict with India.
 Meanwhile, the general believes, they strengthen his bargaining power with India. On their own, other forces against him are a lesser threat. In three years as Pakistan's leader, General Musharraf has largely bleached out the Islamist colour given to the armed forces by a former dictator, Zia ul Haq. The top ranks have been purged; many lower-level officers with over-zealous views are being discreetly retired. The general can now count on an officer corps that is loyal to him and moderate in ideology. That includes the head of the ISI, Ehsan ul Haq.
 He has handled Pakistan's political parties less deftly. Most of these are moderate by instinct but capable of being vindictive. General Musharraf seized power from politicians and has governed as an anti-politician. He regards Benazir Bhutto and Nawaz Sharif, the exiled former prime ministers who lead the two main political parties, as corrupt, and has made little attempt to work either with them or with their followers. The two parties are likely to win most of the seats in parliament when elections are held in October. Unless he shares power with at least one of them he will find himself politically orphaned, facing a hostile parliament ready to exploit any vulnerability.
 A deal on Kashmir that could be construed as a sell-out would be a perfect opening for the general's foes. Even the army's loyalty might waver. To get a favourable deal, it suits Pakistan's strongman to look powerless. India, though, will remain sceptical. Its view is that the Kashmiri militants depend so heavily on the ISI for equipment, transport and money that it can cut them off anytime it likes. The rest of the world wants the terror to stop, too, but worries more about the consequences for General Musharraf. If he stumbles, the malevolent forces at work in Pakistan might break free.","  As war fever mounts , Pakistan 's leader is negotiating a potentially deadly sequence of domestic constraints

ATAL BEHARI VAJPAYEE, India's prime minister, this week performed his most sweeping ministerial reshuffle since coming to power four years ago, swapping the foreign-affairs and finance portfolios of Jaswant Singh and Yashwant Sinha, and strengthening the leadership of his Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP). But it is another appointment that could have longer-term political significance for India, not to mention for Pakistan and the wider world. The elevation of L.K. Advani (pictured left, with Mr Vajpayee), the home minister and Mr Vajpayee's long-time political comrade and rival, to the additional post of deputy prime minister is a milestone.
Mr Advani's promotion and the lack of dissent from the ruling coalition appears to mean that the coalition's members have accepted him as the prime ministerial heir to Mr Vajpayee, who is 77 and has visibly aged in the past couple of years. This is a coup of sorts for Mr Advani, who is universally seen as the government's leading Hindu-nationalist hardliner, a reputation he first earned ten years ago when he led a movement that demolished an ancient mosque on a disputed religious site in Ayodhya, sparking widespread riots.
Although Mr Advani has since said that he regrets the demolition, there is little doubt that if the government were not constrained by its coalition partners, he would have wanted it to implement the BJP's Hindutva (""Hinduness"") agenda. This would include rebuilding a Hindu temple at Ayodhya and reversing laws that favour India's 12% Muslim minority. A few weeks back, Mr Advani caused alarm by threatening Pakistan with dismemberment, as in 1971. And he has several times clashed with Mr Vajpayee recently, with Mr Advani generally on the side of intransigence towards Pakistan and India's Muslims.
The nervous will see this week's appointment as a sign that the government is swinging to the right and that the BJP will not in future be prepared to see its hawkish Hindu nationalism tempered by political allies. Optimists argue that, for the time being at least, things will not work out like that. Mr Advani is ambitious. He has been softening his hardline image and trying to play down his rivalry with Mr Vajpayee. This week, at his boss's request, he persuaded Narendra Modi, the BJP ideologue who is chief minister of Gujarat, where 2,000 people died in Hindu-Muslim riots in April, to postpone a controversial yatra, or tour of the state, that would almost certainly have exacerbated already deeply worrying religious tensions.
No one believes that Mr Advani--seen in the BJP as Mr Vajpayee's undisputed successor as party leader--has really tempered his nationalist fervour. But he has been careful to make himself appear more acceptable to the BJP's coalition allies. They must reckon that he is here to stay. Although only three years younger than Mr Vajpayee, he has led a more ascetic life, giving him a leaner and sharper look. By contrast, Mr Vajpayee is not expected to remain in active politics much beyond the next general election, due by mid- to late 2004--if he lasts that long.
Mr Vajpayee's administration has anyway been in urgent need of a facelift. Its defeats in elections and its failure to quell the Gujarat riots have helped the opposition Congress Party to look nationally credible again after six years in the doldrums. As well as promoting Mr Advani, this week's cabinet reshuffle is intended to reverse that trend in elections over the next 18 months in Delhi, Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan, as well as in troubled Gujarat.
The Singh-Sinha job swap is, at first glance, puzzling. Both men have had their posts since 1998, when the coalition first came to power. Mr Sinha needed to be moved because he had failed to win much support for reform. This forced him to water down some of the main proposals in his five annual budgets, and he was blamed for adding to the BJP's unpopularity this year when tax increases hit the middle classes. Though presiding over some serious financial-market liberalisation, including opening up the insurance sector, he has failed to tackle the growing fiscal deficit and a stream of market scams. 
By contrast, Mr Singh has beenacclaimed as one of India's most effective foreign ministers, maintaining a strong stand through India's peace bids and crises with Pakistan, and transforming relations with America, where he became popular with senior officials in both the Clinton and Bush administrations. 
Mr Sinha's logical replacement would have been one of the government's younger members, probably Arun Shourie, who has been a successful privatisation minister. But Mr Shourie was regarded as too insensitive a reformer. Mr Singh, Mr Vajpayee's first choice for finance in 1998, emerged as a logical fall-back. It then made sense to replace him with Mr Sinha.
This compromise may yet work out reasonably well for Mr Vajpayee. He now has a staunch ally in charge of the finance ministry. He can also call the shots on foreign policy through Brajesh Mishra, his national security adviser. But all this supposes that the fast-rising Mr Advani is content for the present to be a co-operative deputy prime minister, holding his instincts in check and refraining from encouraging the hardline Hindu nationalists behind the scenes. That is probably going to be the tricky bit.","India 's leading Hindu demagogue moves a step closer to the top 
 Atal Bihari Vajpayee's , this week performed Atal Bihari Vajpayee's most sweeping ministerial reshuffle since coming to power four years ago , swapping the foreign - affairs and finance portfolios of Jaswant Singh and Yashwant Sinha , and strengthening the leadership of Atal Bihari Vajpayee's Bharatiya Janata Party ( BJP ) . But it is another appointment that could have longer - term political significance for India , not to mention for Pakistan and the wider world . The elevation of L.K. Advani ( pictured left , with Atal Bihari Vajpayee ) , the home minister and Atal Bihari Vajpayee's long - time political comrade and rival , to the additional post of deputy prime minister is a milestone . 
 Mr Advani 's promotion and the lack of dissent from the ruling coalition appears to mean that the coalition 's members have accepted him as the prime ministerial heir to Atal Bihari Vajpayee . This is a coup of sorts for Mr Advani , who is universally seen as the government 's leading Hindu - nationalist hardliner , a reputation he first earned ten years ago when he led a movement that demolished an ancient mosque on a disputed religious site in Ayodhya , sparking widespread riots . 
 Although Mr Advani has since said that he regrets the demolition , there is little doubt that if the government were not constrained by its coalition partners , he would have wanted it to implement the BJP 's Hindutva ( "" Hinduness "" ) agenda . This would include rebuilding a Hindu temple at Ayodhya and reversing laws that favour India 's 12 % Muslim minority . A few weeks back , Mr Advani caused alarm by threatening Pakistan with dismemberment , as in 1971 . And he has several times clashed with Atal Bihari Vajpayee recently , with Mr Advani generally on the side of intransigence towards Pakistan and India 's Muslims . 
 The nervous will see this week 's appointment as a sign that the government is swinging to the right and that the BJP will not in future be prepared to see its hawkish Hindu nationalism tempered by political allies . Optimists argue that , for the time being at least , things will not work out like that . Mr Advani is ambitious . He has been softening his hardline image and trying to play down his rivalry with Atal Bihari Vajpayee . This week , at Atal Bihari Vajpayee's request , he persuaded Narendra Modi , the BJP ideologue who is chief minister of Gujarat , where 2,000 people died in Hindu - Muslim riots in April , to postpone a controversial yatra , or tour of the state , that would almost certainly have exacerbated already deeply worrying religious tensions . 
 No one believes that Mr Advani -- seen in the BJP as Atal Bihari Vajpayee's undisputed successor as party leader -- has really tempered his nationalist fervour . But he has been careful to make himself appear more acceptable to the BJP 's coalition allies . They must reckon that he is here to stay . Although only three years younger than Atal Bihari Vajpayee , he has led a more ascetic life , giving him a leaner and sharper look . By contrast , Atal Bihari Vajpayee is not expected to remain in active politics much beyond the next general election , due by mid- to late 2004 - -if Atal Bihari Vajpayee lasts that long .

IF THE militants who killed 28 people, including 13 women, in a slum near the city of Jammu in Indian-administered Kashmir on July 13th had hoped to cause an escalation in military tensions between India and Pakistan, they failed. Pakistan immediately condemned the attack and denied any responsibility, while India carefully avoided blaming Pakistan for aiding the killers. 
This was in contrast to the situation in May, when the two nuclear powers came close to war after terrorists opened fire on a bus outside an army camp in Jammu, killing over 30 people, mostly soldiers' wives and children. Atal Bihari Vajpayee, the prime minister, said India's soldiers should ""prepare for a decisive battle"" against terrorism, and Pakistani officials did not rule out a nuclear response.
But India wanted to avoid war. It gambled that its coercive diplomacy and the risk of a nuclear war would compel the United States and Britain to force Pervez Musharraf, Pakistan's president, to withdraw support for the terrorists by ending infiltration into Indian Kashmir and dismantling terrorist camps near the frontier. The tactic worked, up to a point. Infiltration decreased, but India says it increased again at the end of June. It says Pakistan has not tried to close down the camps and end support for terrorists who are already inside Indian Kashmir. India is also sceptical about Pakistan's denial of responsibility for last weekend's killings. 
So why has India's response to the killings been muted? Officials say they lack firm information about who was responsible. But there are other, bigger reasons. The government knows that it cannot expect international opinion to swing into action against Pakistan every time there is a terrorist attack, and that it will lose credibility if it repeatedly threatens a war that fails to materialise. There was yet another incident this week, when Indian security forces exchanged fire with suspected militants hiding in a mosque in Banihal. 
The government wants to concentrate on state-assembly elections in Jammu & Kashmir planned for September or October, which, it hopes, will lower tensions. A relatively quiet period before the polls will, it is hoped, persuade Kashmir's sceptical political parties to take part, and a credible number of people to vote. Arun Jaitley, a former law minister, was appointed this week to start talks with political parties on giving the state more autonomy. The state government has begun to face up to allegations of human-rights abuses by security forces. It admitted this week that forensic tests have shown that five alleged foreign terrorists, who were killed by security forces two years ago after 35 Sikhs had been massacred, were innocent civilians. But sceptics in Kashmir said the announcement was an electioneering ploy. 
There is a risk that Mr Musharraf will be tempted to allow infiltrators to cross into Indian Kashmir and stage occasional terrorist attacks, on the assumption that India will stay quiet. Bigger attacks could then be staged during and after the elections which, India assumes, Pakistan will want to disrupt. 
This risk is expected to be discussed in talks that Jack Straw, Britain's foreign secretary, is due to have this weekend in Delhi and Islamabad, followed next week by Colin Powell, the American secretary of state. India's line is that it will not agree to talks with Pakistan until infiltration stops and terrorist camps are disbanded. It is sceptical about whether America and Britain are willing to deal firmly with Mr Musharraf while they need his support for tackling al-Qaeda's wider international terrorism. But, India will tell the visitors, it will only be persuaded that Mr Musharraf is trying to stop terrorism if the Jammu & Kashmir elections are relatively free of attacks. Don't expect peace in the subcontinent if the elections are disrupted.","Aftermath of the new attack in Kashmir

SOME trappings of a normal election are there. Buses bristling with megaphones and party flags barrel along the roads; dancers and drummers attend the candidates at village rallies. Lurking nearby, though, are camouflaged men with guns, and they are needed at this time. On September 11th, Mushtaq Lone, a candidate for the ruling party in the elections for the state assembly of Jammu and Kashmir, was shot dead along with six of his companions. 
Mr Lone, the state's law minister, is the most prominent victim yet of Pakistan-based militants who are trying to disrupt the elections. Their ultimate purpose is to wrest India's only Muslim-majority state from its control. Mr Lone's murder raises the risk that the elections, which are to begin on September 16th, will not meet what is probably their most important objective: convincing India to resume talks with Pakistan after a breakdown in relations that pushed the nuclear powers to the brink of war this summer. India has made it clear that it will judge Pakistan's fitness for dialogue by the level of election violence. 
The second electoral goal was already a lost cause: persuading separatist politicians to enter the democratic mainstream, to press their cause from the platform of the state assembly. There is a chance to salvage a final one: to prove that India can hold free and fair elections in a state where vote rigging has come to symbolise everything people hate about its rule. 
Failure would reverberate widely. Colin Powell, the American secretary of state, said in Delhi in July that credible elections could be a first step toward peace in Kashmir and dialogue with Pakistan. In his remarks some Kashmiris saw hope. They have had their fill of war, which began 13 years ago as an indigenous rebellion against Indian rule and is sustained now by imported militants, who often indulge in sheer terrorism. Their crimes provoke brutality by Indian security forces. ""We are facing two guns,"" as a villager in Mr Lone's Kupwara district puts it. Many are also fed up with the National Conference party, which has ruled for the past six years and headed most of the state's elected governments. They think it achieved power through rigging elections and has done little with it but enrich its bosses. 
Most Kashmiris in the Valley, the Muslim dominated part of the state, scorn both India and Pakistan: they want azadi, independence. If cynical Kashmiris turn out to vote, it will be in part because they think the Americans are looking on. ""We are fighting elections on the assurance given by the Americans,"" says Muhammad Amin Khan, a jobless man in a Kupwara village. ""If they don't lead to a solution in Kashmir, there will be bloodshed.""
The United States wields influence only on the governments of Pakistan and India, and they have been resistant. Pakistan's dictator, Pervez Musharraf, condemns election violence, including the murder of Mr Lone, but outfits based in his jurisdiction are its most zealous practitioners. In May Pakistan-based militants murdered Abdul Gani Lone, a moderate separatist who was thinking of taking part. If the Kashmir elections are farcical, as General Musharraf has claimed, it is in part because groups operating under his nose are making them so. If this gets bad enough, India may refuse to talk to Pakistan and might even resume making warlike noises. 
K. Rajendra Kumar, inspector-general of the Kashmir police, insists that infiltration by militants across the line of control, which divides the state into zones controlled by India and Pakistan, is as high as ever, despite General Musharraf's promises to stop it. The government in Delhi had been keeping an open mind about whether to talk to him after the elections, but outrages such as the murder of Kashmir's law minister are bound to shut it. 
India, too, bungled its democratic prep work. It says that the separatists who decided to sit out the elections are beholden to Pakistan, tempted by its cash and frightened of its guns. But India's inducements were niggardly. Three top leaders of the All-Party Hurriyat Conference, the main separatist grouping, are in jail. India hinted that it would suspend the state government during the election to reduce the risk of rigging, then backed away for fear of offending the chief minister, Farooq Abdullah, whose National Conference party is part of the coalition that governs in Delhi. Any separatist who stood for election risked looking like a stooge, which might have been India's hope. 
The Hurriyat is boycotting the polls, though unenthusiastically. A few pro-azadi candidates are contesting, but the bulk of the opposition is a motley, but largely pro-Indian collection of independents, defectors from the National Conference and mainstream parties, such as the Congress party. The voting could thus be perfectly free and fair without reflecting the will of the electorate. That does not mean the election will be a non-event. Resentment against the National Conference may be running high enough to topple it, which could bring in a government that is fractious but on better terms with the electorate. The party is fighting back with a new leader, Omar Abdullah, Farooq's son, who is bright, young and does not have enough of a track record to have disappointed the voters. It is well organised and will benefit if the turnout is low. 
If an Abdullah scrapes back in, the six years of the next assembly might be a lot like the last, especially if the Indian government sticks to its line that it will talk only to Kashmir's elected representatives. There are hints that it may not. A committee of notables, which claims government backing, has lately been talking to Hurriyat leaders. One of them, Mirwaiz Umar Farooq, suggested on September 10th that they might settle for autonomy within India. This does not appeal to most Kashmiris, who have seen autonomy granted and then snatched away before. It seems scant recompense for the 30,000-70,000 Kashmiris who have died in the insurgency. But it might be made palatable by guarantees and amends for past abuses.
The decision, though, rests with India and Pakistan. Both countries' leaders were due to speak to the United Nations' General Assembly this week, General Musharraf on Thursday and India's prime minister, Atal Behari Vajpayee, on Friday. Some new thinking on bringing peace to Kashmir was hoped for. Autonomy would preserve India's territorial integrity, its highest priority; just possibly, it would allow Pakistan to claim credit for securing Kashmiris' self-determination. If they were reasonable, the Indian and Pakistani governments would agree on autonomy in some form. If the governments were honourable they could persuade Kashmiris that they were safe in settling for it. But neither government has displayed much reason or honour on Kashmir.","On the eve of voting, a law minister is shot dead

NO COUNTRY likes to be reduced to the status of a junk bond, so it is not surprising that a particularly proud and basically stable nation such as India was scornful when Standard & Poor's, a rating agency, downgraded rupee-denominated government debt on September 19th from BBB- to BB+. But India's loss of investment-grade status, and ranking with the likes of Costa Rica and Peru, had little impact on the markets. That was partly because the downgrade was seen as over-harsh when there has been no sudden change in economic fundamentals, and partly because 98% of the government's debt is in domestic markets. S&P cited the government's ""growing rupee debt burden"" and its ""inability to staunch the financial weakening of the public sector"". Finance ministry officials replied that India's fiscal deficit had been stable for four years (though it is uncomfortably high at around 11% of GDP, taking central and state budgets together), and that reserves were a record $62 billion.
But S&P did have a point about the public sector. The government has just postponed for three months the sale of its controlling stakes in two refinery and petrol-station companies, BPCL and HPCL. That decision encouraged political opponents of other imminent sales of shipping, aluminium and fertiliser companies to come out of the woodwork, and it now looks as if the government's most active reform initiative may have been halted. Having been ambushed on these sales by his cabinet colleagues, Arun Shourie, the reformist disinvestment minister, shows no signs at present of pursuing plans for privatising these and other corporations. 
Adding to the gloom, the government had decided earlier last week to delay a decision on recommendations made by a planning group that foreign direct investment (FDI) restrictions in telecommunications, aviation and insurance should be relaxed. Atal Behari Vajpayee, the prime minister, had hoped to push through these changes to offset the impact of the privatisation delay. He might try again at a cabinet meeting due on September 28th. 
FDI inflows touched a record $1.35 billion in the first quarter of this year, boosted by several big items such as the $200m purchase by Suzuki, a Japanese motor manufacturer, of the government's stake in its Maruti car joint-venture. The delayed privatisations would have triggered more such foreign purchases. But India's already shaky reputation as a reliable destination for FDI looks like receiving a further knock from a dispute, which the government is allowing to escalate, between BG (British Gas) and the public-sector Oil & Natural Gas Corporation over operating rights in a successful offshore oil and gas field.
Since the privatisation push began at the beginning of 2000, the control of 12 industrial and service companies has been sold (along with a clutch of hotels) to what are called strategic partners such as Suzuki, bringing 113 billion rupees ($2.3 billion) to the government. Sensing increased market value as potential bidders lined up for future sales, the price of minority government stakes in 32 public-sector businesses listed on the stockmarket rose by more than 70% in the first five months of this year, when the sales momentum was picking up, and then fell back 20% after the negative BPCL and HPCL decisions. Pradip Baijal, the official in charge of disinvestment, says that this shows the benefit of selling controlling stakes to strategic partners, who are willing to bid high prices. 
Some critics prefer India's previous practice of floating public sector shares on to the stockmarket because this can delay change and does not pose such an immediate threat to vested interests. That view might prevail. With nine state assembly elections due in the coming year or so, and a general election in 2004, it seems unlikely that the government will be able to do anything very adventurous.

Atal Bihari Vajpayee had hoped to push through these changes to offset the impact of the privatisation delay . Atal Bihari Vajpayee might try again at a cabinet meeting due on September 28th . 
 FDI inflows touched a record $ 1.35 billion in the first quarter of this year , boosted by several big items such as the $ 200 m purchase by Suzuki , a Japanese motor manufacturer , of the government 's stake in its Maruti car joint - venture . The delayed privatisations would have triggered more such foreign purchases . But India 's already shaky reputation as a reliable destination for FDI looks like receiving a further knock from a dispute , which the government is allowing to escalate , between BG ( British Gas ) and the public - sector Oil & Natural Gas Corporation over operating rights in a successful offshore oil and gas field . 
 Since the privatisation push began at the beginning of 2000 , the control of 12 industrial and service companies has been sold ( along with a clutch of hotels ) to what are called strategic partners such as Suzuki , bringing 113 billion rupees ( $ 2.3 billion ) to the government . Sensing increased market value as potential bidders lined up for future sales , the price of minority government stakes in 32 public - sector businesses listed on the stockmarket rose by more than 70 % in the first five months of this year , when the sales momentum was picking up , and then fell back 20 % after the negative BPCL and HPCL decisions . Pradip Baijal , the official in charge of disinvestment , says that this shows the benefit of selling controlling stakes to strategic partners , who are willing to bid high prices . 
 Some critics prefer India 's previous practice of floating public sector shares on to the stockmarket because this can delay change and does not pose such an immediate threat to vested interests . That view might prevail . With nine state assembly elections due in the coming year or so , and a general election in 2004 , it seems unlikely that the government will be able to do anything very adventurous .

IN AN impressive example of what the Indian authorities can achieve when they are determined to prevent riots, the army was staging ""flag marches"" across the state of Gujarat as The Economist went to press. Police and paramilitary security forces were on patrol in major cities and towns throughout the country. All were trying, apparently successfully, to prevent a fresh round of religious violence, after a terrorist siege at a Hindu temple left 30 people dead, and the country's main Hindu fundamentalist group called for a nationwide strike in protest on September 26th. 
The siege started late on the afternoon of September 24th when gunmen entered the Akshardham temple complex at Gandhinagar, throwing grenades and firing on worshippers. Some 500 people were rescued from the sprawling complex. The siege ended in the early hours of the following morning, when security forces killed the gunmen. 
Gandhinagar is the seat of Gujarat's government, which was condemned earlier this year for standing aside during Hindu-Muslim riots, in which more than 2,000 people are believed to have been killed. Those riots started when 58 Hindu pilgrims were burned alive on a train at the Gujarati town of Godhra. Hindus responded by going on the rampage. 
No group has claimed responsibility for the latest attack. But L.K. Advani, India's deputy prime minister, and Narendra Modi, the state's chief minister and a prominent member of the ruling BJP party, both blamed Pakistan--an accusation quickly denied in Islamabad. Letters found on the bodies of a gunman were said to carry the title Tehreek-e-Qassas, an unknown group which Indian officials said could be linked to the Pakistan-based Lashkar-e-Taiba, allegedly involved in an attack on the Indian parliament in New Delhi last December. 
Other Indian ministers were more cautious (though blaming Pakistan probably helped reduce the risk of a backlash against the Muslim minority by suggesting that the attack was inspired by politics, not religion). The siege coincided with elections in India's disputed territory of Kashmir which have drawn unexpectedly large turnouts of 40-50% in the first two rounds of voting. Referring indirectly to Pakistan, India's prime minister, Mr Atal Behari Vajpayee said the siege had been staged because opponents of the elections were ""jealous"" of their success.
Gujarat has been a potential tinderbox since the earlier riots. Mr Modi, one of the country's most controversial politicians, has recently been condemned for making inflammatory remarks against Muslims. He called the relief camps to which they fled during the riots ""baby producing centres"". That was a reference to a view held by hardliners that Muslims have large families in order to increase their religion's population in India. 
Elections are due in Gujarat by the end of the year and the state is fearful of another outbreak of violence. The BJP has been trying to rein in Mr Modi, lest his extreme views costs them more votes than they win. Politicians such as Mr Advani and Mr Vajpayee, who quickly flew to the scene of the siege, made it clear to him that the attack was not to be used as an excuse for a second round of attacks on Muslims. ""This game of violence and counter-violence has to stop,"" Mr Vajpayee said bluntly. Easier said than done.

ELECTION rigging got India into trouble in Jammu & Kashmir, its only Muslim majority state, but it will take more than one relatively fair election to get India out. Kashmiris took up arms against the Indian government after the state's 1987 elections, widely regarded as a stitch-up by the National Conference, the current ruling party. Pakistan, which claims Kashmir as its own, has been fomenting violent opposition to Indian rule there ever since.
Against this history, the state elections that ended this week are a breakthrough. Turnout was a respectable 44%, even though anti-Indian militants assassinated candidates and threatened voters. Independent observers judged the voting the fairest in a quarter-century. The results change the state's political complexion.
As The Economist went to press, the National Conference, led by Kashmir's main political dynasty, the Abdullah family, seemed to have lost power, though it may remain the largest party. Omar Abdullah, the young scion who had recently assumed leadership of the party, could not even win his seat. The gainers are Congress, India's main opposition party, which did well mainly in the Hindu-majority Jammu region, and the People's Democratic Party (PDP), whose base is the Muslim-dominated Kashmir Valley. They are now expected to try to form a coalition government. India can congratulate itself on having held an election capable of evicting an unpopular party.
But it is not certain that the results will quell discontent among Kashmiri Muslims, still less that they will ease tensions between India and Pakistan, whose armies have been mobilised for war since December. The mood will depend on whether the new government can better Kashmir's dismal human-rights record, cut corruption and spur development. 
The central government in Delhi now faces weighty decisions. Does it treat the election as proof that Kashmir is a normal part of India, apart from violence sponsored by Pakistan? That is what hardliners in India's ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) would like to do. Or will it open serious talks on conferring more autonomy on Kashmir, and if so, with whom? The newly elected government may speak for the state's people, but the PDP will argue for involving at least some members of the All Party Hurriyat Conference, the main grouping of separatist parties, which boycotted the vote. A number of candidates linked to one of the Hurriyat's moderate members won seats, bringing pro-independence voices into the assembly.
The second big issue is how to deal with Pakistan. India accuses Pakistan of trying to derail the election through violence, thus failing the test India set for resuming dialogue. Atal Behari Vajpayee, the Indian prime minister, this week mocked Pakistan's president, Pervez Musharraf, as a ""self-annointed king"".
Yet Pakistan was holding elections of its own on October 10th. Three years after staging a coup, General Musharraf is to hand most of his power to an elected government--though probably only in theory. With both elections out of the way, India will now face much greater international pressure to talk. There is speculation that it will soon scale down its military mobilisation. But further progress may have to await yet another election, in the state of Gujarat, where Hindu mobs killed more than 1,000 Muslims earlier this year. The governing Hindu-nationalist BJP hopes its record in a state it controls will help it win the election, due by early next year. Until then, it may not pay to be too soft on Muslims, whether Kashmiris or Pakistanis.

FOR two years the state of Gujarat in western India has been making unhappy headlines: it has suffered an earthquake in January 2001 in which some 40,000 people died; the worst drought in a decade; and, earlier this year, murderous communal violence. Now an election on December 12th for the state's legislature will have nationwide repercussions. Gujarat is back on the front pages. Once again, it is not a good-news story. 
For that, blame Narendra Modi, the acting chief minister. Mr Modi, from the Hindu-nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), which leads India's coalition government, is exploiting communal tensions for hoped-for electoral gain. If he succeeds, the habit may catch on. It could poison Indian politics before the general election that is due by 2004 at the latest, and raise questions about the future of the prime minister, Atal Behari Vajpayee, a BJP moderate. If he fails, the BJP-led government will be weakened, perhaps terminally. Some political observers reckon that Gujarat's is the most important state election for a decade.
Long a controversial figure, Mr Modi has been pilloried for his role in the riots that scarred Gujarat after February 27th. That was when a carriage on a train bringing Hindu activists back from the site of a contentious proposed temple in Ayodhya was set on fire in the town of Godhra. Fifty-eight people, mostly women and children, were killed. 
There followed, in parts of Gujarat, a pogrom against Muslims. More than 2,000 people died. Mr Modi's government is accused, at best, of having failed to stop the bloodshed; at worst, in a report of a recent investigation, of taking a part in leading and sponsoring the violence. 
The state government's alleged motive was electoral. In 1998, the BJP won 117 out of 182 seats in the state legislature with 45% of the vote. But because of its poor performance in office it was losing by-elections to the Congress party, which also forms the main national opposition. 
Congress could attract the votes of Muslims (some 10% of the population), of other minorities, such as tribal groups, and of lower-caste Hindus and Dalits (formerly ""untouchables""). But if the 30m-strong electorate votes on communal Hindu v Muslim grounds rather than for caste or economic reasons, it would benefit the BJP. The violence, much of which pitted Dalits against Muslims, made this more likely. 
In July Mr Modi called an early election. This attempt to capitalise on the communal tension was thwarted, however, by India's independent election commission, which delayed the poll until tempers had cooled. Mr Modi has railed against the election commissioner, J.M. Lyngdoh, joking that he may be Italian (like Sonia Gandhi, Congress's leader, who launched her party's campaign this week with an address to a huge public rally). Now, opinion polls in what seems to be a close contest are divided on whether the Hindu card is proving a trump or not. 
The Congress party in Gujarat is led by Shankersinh Vaghele, who himself comes from the Hindu nationalist movement. He says that his party's campaign will take up issues such as the shortages of electricity and drinking water in the state, and adds that the main theme of the election is the caste of the candidate, rather than the communal divide. 
Mr Vajpayee has said that the Godhra massacre should not be an election issue. The BJP manifesto is dutifully silent. But posters of Mr Modi, defiantly silhouetted against the backdrop of a blazing train, have appeared across Gujarat. The BJP's sister organisations, such as the World Hindu Council (the Vishwa Hindu Parishad, or VHP), have shown little restraint. 
Prawin Togadia, the VHP's international general secretary, says people need to be reminded of Godhra and the threat to Indian civilisation posed by Islamic fundamentalism. Gujarat, he points out, borders on Pakistan, and he alleges that it is Pakistan's next target after Kashmir, where India accuses it of waging a proxy war of terrorism. Mr Togadia says he is on the front line: his own life has often been threatened. On December 3rd, a local leader of the VHP, Jaideep Patel, was shot and wounded on the outskirts of Ahmedabad, the state's largest city. 
He insists that he and Mr Modi both stand for a version of Hindutva, a nationalist creed, that is pluralist, inclusive, democratic and secular. These are the foundations on which independent India's founders sought to build their state. But Gujarat is regarded as a laboratory for Hindutva. It would not just be some upper-class liberals who would see a decisive victory there for Mr Modi as a potentially explosive threat to that underpinning.","Gujarat 's voters could decide the future of the whole country 's government

THE closer you look, the worse it seems. It is bad enough that a hate-filled campaign playing on communal fears propelled Hindu nationalists to a landslide election victory in the western state of Gujarat, despite a bloody pogrom against the Muslim minority earlier this year. More distressing still is the compelling evidence that the violence was actually a vote-winner for the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and its chief minister in Gujarat, Narendra Modi. The implications are worrying both for the tenor of India's domestic politics, and for its relations with the outside world, especially its neighbour and fellow nuclear power, Pakistan. 
The results, announced on December 15th, showed that the BJP, which leads the national coalition government, had increased its share of the 182 seats in the state legislature from 117 to 126, against 51 for Congress, the main opposition. It achieved this despite the anti-incumbency vote so important in Indian elections. (This had not vanished altogether: 12 BJP ministers lost their seats.) Almost all the BJP gains were made in riot-hit constituencies: the party won 53 out of 65 such seats with big majorities, a 19% margin of victory, compared with 5% elsewhere. 
Yet the BJP had been steadily losing control of state governments ever since 1999. In Gujarat, too, it had lost a string of by-elections. It was vulnerable on many counts: water shortages, rising unemployment and the collapse of co-operative banks with some 2m depositors. 
The turning-point came on February 27th. A train carrying Hindu activists back from Ayodhya, where they were campaigning for the construction of a temple on a disputed site, was attacked in the town of Godhra. A carriage was set on fire, and 58 people died. Muslims were blamed, and punished. More than 2,000 people died. By the time of the election, 220,000 people displaced by the riots were still away from home. Few areas are now integrated across communal lines. Even before this year's troubles, Gujarat was becoming a state of ghettos. 
Mr Modi and his government were accused of having done too little to stem the bloodshed, and even of having encouraged it. He became a hate figure for India's English-language press and abroad. The feelings were mutual, and Mr Modi's election campaign unabashedly harped on Godhra, and on Pakistani-sponsored ""terrorism"". As a result of such terrorism, it was claimed, Hindus in Gujarat were in danger from Muslims. A mere 9% of Gujarat's 50m people are Muslim. 
That this tactic has paid off so handsomely is a triumph for Mr Modi and for his hardline brand of Hindutva nationalism. After the election, dejected liberals in Gujarat were blaming themselves and the Congress party for their failure to counter the BJP strategy. Successful efforts to persuade Muslims to vote early were said to have backfired when television showed pictures of Muslims streaming into polling stations. The imam of a famous mosque was criticised for calling on Muslims to vote for Congress, which BJP turned to its own advantage. 
In fact, apparently taking the Muslim vote for granted, Congress fielded only five Muslim candidates, and made its own soft Hindutva pitch for the nationalist vote. The party was disorganised and divided, and fielded too many candidates better known for their parentage than their local knowledge. In an election turned by Mr Modi into a contest between Gujaratis and the rest, it did not help that the Congress party leader, Sonia Gandhi, was born in Italy. But the opposition's shortcomings cannot disguise the success of Mr Modi's divisive campaign. Congress and the BJP now have to grapple with the implications for nine forthcoming state elections and a general election, due in 2004. 
Both Atal Behari Vajpayee, the prime minister, a BJP moderate, and his hardline deputy, L.K. Advani, have said the result will change neither national policy nor electoral strategy. They may mean it. The BJP rules in coalition with 20 or so other parties, some of which might not tolerate an abrupt rightward lurch. And Gujarat is recognised as being a one-off, both in its history of communal violence, and in the local strength of the BJP and its notionally apolitical sister organisations, such as the World Hindu Council (the Vishwa Hindu Parishad, or VHP), which played a big part in mobilising voters. In other states, where the BJP is not in power, the police are likely to be far more effective in nipping communal violence in the bud. 
That will not stop Hindu extremists from trying to replicate their success. Prawin Togadia, a VHP leader, now forecasts an Indian Hindu state within two years. And the success in Gujarat is bound to have an impact on relations with Pakistan, which remain tense and hostile. On December 16th, a court in Delhi sentenced three Indians to death for conspiring with Pakistan in an attack on India's Parliament a year ago, in which nine people were killed. Even if Mr Vajpayee wanted to, he would find it hard to seek rapprochement with Pakistan in the new climate. At home, Hindutva causes will loom large again. 
Mushirul Hasan, of Delhi's Jamia Millia Islamia university, argues that the elections were not a contest between Muslims and Hindus but between bigotry and modernity. This points to a less obvious consequence of Mr Modi's triumph: a subtle shifting of the terms of India's political debate, in which an ugly extreme moves ominously close to the centre.","A Hindu fundamentalist , Narendra Modi ( pictured ) , triumphs in Gujarat 
 THE closer you look , the worse it seems . It is bad enough that a hate - filled campaign playing on communal fears propelled Hindu nationalists to a landslide election victory in the western state of Gujarat , despite a bloody pogrom against the Muslim minority earlier this year . More distressing still is the compelling evidence that the violence was actually a vote - winner for the Bharatiya Janata Party ( BJP ) and its chief minister in Gujarat , Narendra Modi . The implications are worrying both for the tenor of India 's domestic politics , and for its relations with the outside world , especially its neighbour and fellow nuclear power , Pakistan . 
 The results , announced on December 15th , showed that the BJP , which leads the national coalition government , had increased its share of the 182 seats in the state legislature from 117 to 126 , against 51 for Congress , the main opposition . It achieved this despite the anti - incumbency vote so important in Indian elections . ( This had not vanished altogether : 12 BJP ministers lost their seats . ) Almost all the BJP gains were made in riot - hit constituencies : the party won 53 out of 65 such seats with big majorities , a 19 % margin of victory , compared with 5 % elsewhere . 
 Yet the BJP had been steadily losing control of state governments ever since 1999 . In Gujarat , too , it had lost a string of by - elections . It was vulnerable on many counts : water shortages , rising unemployment and the collapse of co - operative banks with some 2 m depositors . 
 The turning - point came on February 27th . A train carrying Hindu activists back from Ayodhya , where they were campaigning for the construction of a temple on a disputed site , was attacked in the town of Godhra . A carriage was set on fire , and 58 people died . Muslims were blamed , and punished . More than 2,000 people died . By the time of the election , 220,000 people displaced by the riots were still away from home . Few areas are now integrated across communal lines . Even before this year 's troubles , Gujarat was becoming a state of ghettos . 
 Mr Modi and his government were accused of having done too little to stem the bloodshed , and even of having encouraged it . He became a hate figure for India 's English - language press and abroad . The feelings were mutual , and Mr Modi 's election campaign unabashedly harped on Godhra , and on Pakistani - sponsored "" terrorism "" . As a result of such terrorism , it was claimed , Hindus in Gujarat were in danger from Muslims . A mere 9 % of Gujarat 's 50 m people are Muslim . 
 That this tactic has paid off so handsomely is a triumph for Mr Modi and for his hardline brand of Hindutva nationalism . After the election , dejected liberals in Gujarat were blaming themselves and the Congress party for their failure to counter the BJP strategy . Successful efforts to persuade Muslims to vote early were said to have backfired when television showed pictures of Muslims streaming into polling stations . The imam of a famous mosque was criticised for calling on Muslims to vote for Congress , which BJP turned to its own advantage . 
 In fact , apparently taking the Muslim vote for granted , Congress fielded only five Muslim candidates , and made its own soft Hindutva pitch for the nationalist vote . The party was disorganised and divided , and fielded too many candidates better known for their parentage than their local knowledge . In an election turned by Mr Modi into a contest between Gujaratis and the rest , it did not help that the Congress party leader , Sonia Gandhi , was born in Italy . But the opposition 's shortcomings can not disguise the success of Mr Modi 's divisive campaign . Congress and the BJP now have to grapple with the implications for nine forthcoming state elections and a general election , due in 2004 . 
 Atal Bihari Vajpayee's , have said the result will change neither national policy nor electoral strategy . Atal Bihari Vajpayee may mean it . The BJP rules in coalition with 20 or so other parties , some of which might not tolerate an abrupt rightward lurch . And Gujarat is recognised as being a one - off , both in its history of communal violence , and in the local strength of the BJP and its notionally apolitical sister organisations , such as the World Hindu Council ( the Vishwa Hindu Parishad , or VHP ) , which played a big part in mobilising voters . In other states , where the BJP is not in power , the police are likely to be far more effective in nipping communal violence in the bud . 
 That will not stop Hindu extremists from trying to replicate their success . Prawin Togadia , a VHP leader , now forecasts an Indian Hindu state within two years . And the success in Gujarat is bound to have an impact on relations with Pakistan , which remain tense and hostile . On December 16th , a court in Delhi sentenced three Indians to death for conspiring with Pakistan in an attack on India 's Parliament a year ago , in which nine people were killed . Even if Mr Vajpayee wanted to , he would find it hard to seek rapprochement with Pakistan in the new climate . At home , Hindutva causes will loom large again .

MORE than four years ago, in 1998, it became clear, following underground nuclear tests, that India could make the bomb. What was not clear was how it should be controlled: what ""command and control"" structure, to use the official term, was being set up. Officials said that they saw little need to hurry what was a sensitive and complex process because there was a de facto command authority in place, with the prime minister, Atal Behari Vajpayee, in charge of the nuclear trigger. But given India's tendency to defer complex decisions till crises arise, this arrangement has looked worryingly inadequate. Although China's nuclear capability is seen by many strategists as India's main long-term concern, the immediate threat is posed by Pakistan's nuclear weapons, which could take only 300 seconds to reach Delhi. What would happen if 79-year-old Mr Vajpayee were sleeping during those precious seconds, or was killed? 
On January 4th, India's cabinet committee on security provided some answers with a statement that a Nuclear Command Authority has been created, comprising political and executive councils, plus a ""strategic forces"" command, to be headed by a senior air-force officer. The Political Council, with the prime minister as its chairman, is the sole body that can authorise the use of nuclear weapons. Its other members include four senior ministers and Brajesh Mishra, India's national security adviser. Mr Mishra heads the Executive Council that includes military officers, scientists and civil servants. Its job is to advise politicians regularly on the risks of a nuclear attack. 
India continues to reassure Pakistan that its policy is not to be the first to use nuclear weapons, hoping to reduce the risk of its neighbour launching a pre-emptive strike. But this week's statement gives warning, for the first time, that India could retaliate with nuclear weapons if it came under a biological or chemical attack. 
What happens if a nuclear strike wipes out Delhi, the prime minister and the rest of the Political Council? Alternative bodies with authority to use the bomb in such circumstances have been set up elsewhere in India. Defence analysts are questioning how effectively the alternative system would work in practice. They suggest that it could take two or three years to install secure links between alternative command centres and India's air force, army and submarines. But India's determination to face down Pakistan is clear, with the threat of massive response to a nuclear attack. 
George Fernandes, India's defence minister and a member of the Political Council, told a business conference on January 7th that, while India would suffer a little in a nuclear war, there would be no Pakistan left after its retaliation. Mr Fernandes was responding to remarks made in December by General Pervez Musharraf, Pakistan's president, who controls the country's nuclear capability. The general appeared to suggest that he would have ordered a nuclear strike last year, if India had attacked Pakistan with conventional forces after terrorist attacks on its Parliament and on Kashmiri civilians. 
This nuclear sabre-rattling is causing concern internationally at a time when Pakistan-backed terrorist attacks are increasing in Kashmir, raising the prospect of confrontations similar to those of last year. This week's statement at least shows that India's leaders are trying to master subcontinental security, even if it has taken them four years to get around to it.

AS PEACE declarations go, that issued on January 11th by Isak Chisi Swu, a leader of the Naga people, who live in India's north-east and in Myanmar, was emphatic enough. There will be no more fighting, he said, between Nagas and Indians. But there were many sceptics. Formal negotiations with the Indian government have not even begun. Yet already rival Naga leaders are complaining of a sell-out of their demand for independence. Other north-eastern groups, fretting that any Naga gain would be their loss, gave warning of renewed unrest. 
There is no denying, however, that progress has been made in resolving a conflict that has lasted on and off for half a century. The Naga insurgency has in turn helped fuel other secessionist wars that sputter on across the north-east. One study lists 58 insurgent groups. Some run shadow governments, or, bluntly, extortion rackets. Nagas say the conflict has cost the lives of some 200,000 of their people, from a Naga population now estimated at 3.5m-4m. The Indian army says it has lost more soldiers in the north-east than in that other quagmire of thwarted separatism, Kashmir. 
Since 1997, a ceasefire has largely held in the Indian state of Nagaland. Indian leaders and officials have held sporadic peace talks with Mr Swu and Thuingaleng Muivah, the other eponymous leader of the Nationalist Socialist Council of Nagaland (Isak-Muivah). By one count, there are 66 Naga tribes. But the Naga resistance is split into three main camps, with the Isak-Muivah group, with some 2,000 fighters, the strongest. Previous talks have taken place abroad, where the rebel leaders long lived in exile. This month, for the first time in four decades, Mr Muivah and his comrade have come to Delhi. They have met the prime minister, Atal Behari Vajpayee, and other bigwigs, as well as delegations of their own people from Nagaland. They have promised not to disrupt state elections to be held in February in Nagaland (and two other north-eastern states). 
Even so, the outlines of a possible settlement remain murky. The Nagas might accept autonomy short of full independence. But it is unlikely they will agree to Nagaland's current borders. As well as in Myanmar, Nagas also live in the neighbouring Indian states of Arunachal Pradesh, Assam and Manipur, and Nagas have always sought a nation incorporating all these homelands. 
Manipur, birthplace of Mr Muivah, presents the biggest hurdles to peace. It is an ethnic patchwork and its non-Naga majority is alarmed at the Nagas' traditional demand for some two-thirds of the land area of their state, which has its own long-standing claim to independence. In June 2001, when the Indian government agreed to extend the truce from Nagaland to all the Naga-inhabited areas, similar fears led to protests in Manipur, in which at least 18 people died. The offending phrase was expunged from the ceasefire agreement. 
Already, the muffled purring noises coming out of the meetings in the capital have provoked politicians in Manipur and elsewhere to utter warnings about the consequences of carving up other states to meet Naga demands. But there is a brighter perspective: that if peace can be reached with the largest Naga group, it might prove as contagious as did the insurgency, showing others weary of hopeless wars that compromise need not mean defeat.

AFTER decades of indifference, India has begun wooing the 20m of its compatriots who live abroad. Legislation to allow some of them to hold dual nationality is to come before the Indian Parliament in the next few months, and the government is to invite their representatives to a conference in Delhi every January. An inaugural get-together this month was attended by more than 2,000 non-resident Indians (NRIs) and others of Indian origin from 66 countries. Among them were two Nobel laureates, Sir V.S. Naipaul (literature) and Amartya Sen (economics). Sir Anerood Jugnauth, prime minister of Mauritius, was there, along with numerous executives from western countries. ""Welcome home,"" said India's prime minister, Atal Behari Vajpayee. 
While countries such as China, Israel and Ireland have habitually welcomed their diasporas, NRIs used to be dubbed ""not required Indians"". Some were regarded as too poor to be bothered with. Those who joined the brain drain of talent to the United States and elsewhere were resented for their success. 
Such attitudes began to change in the mid-1990s when India started to open up its economy and establish itself as a leading software producer, just as NRIs were emerging as software tycoons abroad. The government's interest remains basically economic, hoping that NRIs will invest in India, and work to improve India's reputation in their adopted countries. ""The overseas Indian matters to the mother country only as a cow that can be milked matters to its owner,"" says Lord Parekh, a Gujarat-born professor at the London School of Economics. Progress to milk the diaspora has so far been slow. Whereas overseas Chinese have contributed as much as 70% of China's foreign direct investment over the past 15 years, NRIs have provided less than 10% of a far smaller total for India. 
Mr Vajpayee may feel his interest in the diaspora could be of benefit to the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), with its ties to Hindu nationalism. Lord Parekh reckons that most diasporas tend to be more right-wing than their counterparts at home, which fits in with the party's desire to use the NRIs to help ""mobilise patriotism"" (as well as contribute to its election expenses). That is worrying, given the violence in Gujarat last year. Those clashes were encouraged by the Vishwa Hindu Parishad, an extreme Hindu-nationalist organisation closely associated with the BJP, and which gets money from Indians in America and Britain.","The diaspora is "" discovered ""

TWENTY years ago, in the Sher-i-Kashmir cricket ground in Srinagar, India endured a humiliating rebuke. Its team's defeat by the West Indies in a one-day match was greeted by the Kashmiri crowd with raucous glee. In a Muslim-majority state also claimed by Pakistan, but where many hanker after independence, it was an important step on the path to civil war. Choosing the same venue to become, on April 18th, the first Indian prime minister to address a big public rally in Srinagar since 1987, Atal Behari Vajpayee made a peacemaker's speech, presented as marking another turning-point, this time towards dialogue and reconciliation. 
There was, however, little immediate cause for optimism. The killing continued in a war that has scarred Kashmir for 13 years and claimed nearly 40,000 lives, according to India (twice as many, say its opponents). On April 22nd, six civilians died in an explosion in the Pulwama district of south Kashmir and, elsewhere, Indian forces killed 17 alleged militants.
So the rally was a bold gesture, requiring massive security and bullet-proof glass. That, said Abdul Ghani Bhat, chairman of Kashmir's separatist alliance, the All-Party Hurriyat Conference, ""is how it is in a colony."" The prime minister's audience of some 20,000 had been bused in by the party of Kashmir's chief minister, Mufti Mohammed Sayeed, installed after elections last September. Many were disappointed by the speech, because it contained no offer of aid for a war-crippled economy, and no concrete plan for peace. 
The Hurriyat, which boycotted the elections, staged a ""silent referendum"" on Mr Vajpayee's visit by ordering a hartal, a general shutdown of Srinagar. It was observed almost universally. But the turn-out at the rally allowed both sides to claim victory in the battle for public opinion. Mr Sayeed clucked nervously over the crowd, like a headmaster worried about his school's behaviour on Founders' Day. But Mr Vajpayee was talking far above their heads anyway, to an audience in Islamabad and in Washington, DC. Appealing for talks with Pakistan on all issues, including Kashmir, he held out the ""hand of friendship"", in the hope of better relations between the two neighbours, which last year came close to their third war over Kashmir. 
Mr Vajpayee's speech glossed over India's oft-repeated condition for any improvement in relations: that Pakistan make good its pledges to stop the infiltration of armed militants into Indian-controlled Kashmir from its side of the line of control that divides the state. 
India, however, soon made clear that it has not dropped this demand. It insists--and America accepts--that Pakistan has not stopped ""cross-border terrorism"". As recently as last month, India blamed Pakistan-trained fighters for a particularly cold-blooded massacre of 24 civilians from the Hindu minority in the village of Nadimarg. Its anger at that outrage was fierce enough to draw an unprecedented joint statement from Britain and America, urging Pakistan to restrain the militants, but both sides to resume dialogue.
India's foreign minister, Yashwant Sinha, bridled at the ""gratuitous and misplaced advice"", and caused further alarm by describing Pakistan as more of a fit case for pre-emptive action than was Iraq. Indian spokesmen stressed that he was making a theoretical point, not a military threat. But India and Pakistan are nuclear powers, so this sort of talk rattles nerves.
Although Mr Vajpayee announced no shift in policy in Srinagar, his stress on dialogue rather than terrorism was seen as encouraging. Pakistan rejected the allegations, but responded positively. After all, the purpose, presumably, of its connivance in cross-border terrorism is to exert pressure on India to enter talks.
Mr Vajpayee's deeper message, however, was less welcome in Pakistan. By speaking in Srinagar, he was demonstrating his government's view that Kashmir remains an integral part of India, and that he believed he was talking from a position of strength. Mr Sayeed's government--the outcome, unusually, of an unrigged election--is more popular than previous administrations, having promised to adopt a ""healing touch"" by, for example, freeing some detained separatists.
The fresh approach includes a dialogue with the central government. On April 22nd, Delhi's latest interlocutor for Kashmir, N.N. Vohra, pitched up in Srinagar, and began talks with what India calls ""mainstream"" politicians. There were hints that he might even be open to meeting the Hurriyat. Mr Bhat, however, said there would be no talks ""at gunpoint"", which did not cover the future dispensation of Kashmir--the one topic India will not discuss with the Hurriyat. 
The Hurriyat, in the words of Muzaffar Beg, the finance minister in the new state government, ""takes its cue from Pakistan, even if it does not take dictation."" But moderate separatists, such as Shabir Shah, also see little improvement in the new government, and Mr Vohra's visit as a futile exercise. They question how he, a former top civil servant in the Home and Defence Ministries, can tackle the core issue--Kashmir's demand for self-determination.
Pakistan, too, may find that, even if dialogue with India resumes, there is, on Kashmir, little to talk about. Its ""liberation"" is a central national goal for Pakistan. No government could easily negotiate it away. The present regime, with a tenuous popular mandate and under constant attack from Islamists, would presumably find it even harder than most. As in the past, talks, if they happen, may serve only to sharpen differences. Meanwhile, with the passes into Kashmir now free of snow, violence there is only likely to increase.","To foreign relief but local scepticism , India and Pakistan both talk about talks

WHEN it comes to the vexed trinity of India, Pakistan and Kashmir, things are often the opposite of how they seem. In December 2001, for instance, it looked to much of the world as though the two nuclear powers were at the brink of war. In response to an attack on its parliament building in Delhi, India massed hundreds of thousands of troops along its border with Pakistan. In fact, senior Indian politicians now admit in private, war was never seriously contemplated. The threat of Armageddon, though, had its uses. It concentrated minds, America's included. Pakistan's president, Pervez Musharraf, was pressed hard to crack down--though he did it only partially--on the Islamic groups that carry out violent attacks in Indian-controlled Kashmir and that his government shelters. Now, however, there is a danger of what stockbrokers would call overshoot in the opposite, more optimistic, direction.
To general relief, India and Pakistan have agreed to re-establish full diplomatic relations ()see page 57. There is less to this than meets the eye: until February, relations were being conducted efficiently enough, at deputy-ambassador level, before a rather juvenile row led to a round of expulsions. Potentially much more important is the stated desire of both sides to resume talks over the issues in dispute between them, including Kashmir. There has been no summit meeting between the two countries since General Musharraf and India's prime minister, Atal Behari Vajpayee, met, disastrously, at Agra in July 2001. Also welcome is an apparent agreement to re-open air links between South Asia's two largest countries, severed since the Delhi attack.
The presence in the region this week of Richard Armitage, America's deputy secretary of state, further encourages the view that some sort of co-ordinated rapprochement is under way. But the danger is that this, like every other India-Pakistan initiative, will founder on the rock that is Kashmir. On this issue, there is no real change to be discerned on either side. 
Unbalanced
The asymmetry that bedevils the entire process is that India already has pretty much what it wants. It controls all but a miserable sliver of Kashmir, and it faces no security threat there that it cannot contain--at a price, but one paid mainly in Kashmiri blood. After holding a relatively successful election in Kashmir last year, India believes that its campaign to win hearts and minds, in Kashmir and abroad, is slowly succeeding.
For Pakistan, the position is much more difficult. Kashmir, with its Muslim majority, is integral to the country's view of itself: one version of the derivation of the very name Pakistan is that the K in it stands for Kashmir. For many years, the essence of Pakistan's foreign policy was to bleed India in Kashmir, while securing a friendly neighbour on its other flank, in Afghanistan. Encouraging a network of Islamic jihadists was the method employed to attain both goals. Forced to choose sides in the global war on terrorism after the September 11th attacks, Pakistan abandoned this strategy in Afghanistan. But there is no convincing sign yet that General Musharraf is brave enough to carry through what would be seen by many in Pakistan as a second betrayal, this time in Kashmir.
India's leaders feel badly let down by General Musharraf, who has repeatedly promised to end cross-border terrorism and close down extremist religious groups. Mr Vajpayee is reluctant to commit himself to another summit meeting until more of this ground-work has been laid. And he has again refused to involve third parties--a rebuff to Pakistan, which insists that Kashmiris be involved too. There can be no concessions, he says, until Pakistan keeps its promise on terrorism.
Here is where America can help. While the war in Afghanistan was still going on, America could not afford to push General Musharraf too hard. But that war has now ended. For many months, critics have been sniping at the Bush administration's unsavoury choice of ally. There is growing evidence, too, that Pakistan helped North Korea develop secret uranium-enrichment technology for its nuclear programme, and may also have helped Iran. Mr Armitage had the opportunity this week to apply considerably more of a squeeze on Pakistan than General Musharraf has experienced of late. September 11th turned him overnight from pariah to America's ally, but Pakistan's own actions could yet reverse that transition. If the fight against terrorism is to mean anything, Pakistan must be forced to renounce it too.","But without progress on Kashmir , the good news wo n't last

THE thrill was palpable after the unexpected announcement on May 2nd by Atal Behari Vajpayee, India's prime minister, that he wanted to start a ""decisive and conclusive dialogue"" aimed at ending the decades of hostility between his country and Pakistan. Zafarullah Jamali, Pakistan's prime minister, smartly responded with a ten-minute telephone call to Mr Vajpayee, and a letter which talked about curbing terrorism and proposed a summit in Islamabad. Colin Powell, America's secretary of state, saw a ""moment of opportunity where both sides seem to be reaching out."" Not to be outdone, General Pervez Musharraf, Pakistan's president and Mr Jamali's boss, weighed in, dusting off old ideas for a non-aggression pact and the de-nuclearisation of the subcontinent. 
Suddenly it seemed that these two nuclear powers might be on the verge of substantive talks. By the middle of this week, however, they were already bickering over the details, underlining the sad truth that an early summit is unlikely, and that it could be years before real progress is made. But even such squabbling is an improvement on the stand-off that developed after India blamed Pakistan for helping to facilitate terrorist atrocities, including a suicide attack on its Parliament in December 2001. The main advance is that, as suggested by Mr Vajpayee, both countries are to reappoint high commissioners (the Commonwealth's equivalent of ambassadors) to each other's capitals; and it looks as if air links may be resumed soon.
America insists that the Vajpayee initiative came as a pleasant surprise, not least for Richard Armitage, the deputy secretary of state, who has been in the region all this week on what was planned as a damage-limitation exercise. There have been fears for months that a fresh terrorist attack in India might lead to more sabre-rattling and possibly a border confrontation. At the end of March, both countries tested nuclear-capable missiles a day after India blamed Pakistan for the massacre of 24 Hindus in Kashmir and the assassination of a local moderate political leader. Instead, Mr Armitage's job now has been firstly to encourage Pakistan to respond positively to Mr Vajpayee, while curbing its support for cross-border terrorism in Kashmir, and secondly to urge India to be patient in its dealings with its neighbour. 
In part, both countries have been taking up positions that would put them in a good light before meeting Mr Armitage. In the case of Pakistan, General Musharraf's meeting with President George Bush in Washington next month will also have played a part. But the Indian moves go deeper. They were taken on the personal initiative of Mr Vajpayee, who stunned his listeners on May 2nd when he told the Indian Parliament that he was launching his ""third and final"" effort for peace. His earlier efforts, in February 1999 and July 2001, had ended in failure that did his image no good at all. 
But at 78, Mr Vajpayee, a former foreign minister, wants to carve out a niche in history. Indian diplomats say he believes the international situation has changed since the Iraq war, and that India and Pakistan are obliged to make a fresh bid for peace. Mr Vajpayee also felt that India had painted itself into a corner by refusing to talk to Pakistan until it had put a complete end to cross-border terrorism, and that this stance could not be sustained indefinitely.
Mr Vajpayee consulted very few cabinet colleagues before his statement on May 2nd. He went ahead despite the scepticism of senior ministers such as L.K. Advani, the deputy prime minister. Leaders of his Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) also oppose the initiative, partly because they do not believe anything will be achieved, but mainly because they want to play up what they believe are vote-winning fears of Pakistan-aided terrorism during state elections this autumn and in a general election next year. But Mr Vajpayee's stature is such that opposition has melted away in the past week and, for now, he is free to pursue his initiative, supported even by the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS), the BJP's hardline-Hindu sister organisation.
However, the BJP will quickly lose patience if the initiative does not yield results. These need to include a demonstration by Pakistan that it is serious about stopping terrorists crossing into Kashmir and about closing down their support facilities on its side of the border. India realises that General Musharraf cannot control the terrorists completely. Yet 156 people have been killed (103 militants and 53 Indian forces and civilians) since Mr Vajpayee's trip to Srinagar on April 18th, when he held out ""the hand of friendship"". 
So far, Pakistan's responses have not been sufficient for India to go beyond restoring ambassador-level relations and perhaps air links, though Mr Jamali did say last weekend that Pakistan would not insist on focusing first on resolving the Kashmir dispute. India criticised proposals by Mr Jamali on May 6th for not going far enough on removing restrictions on trade, and for saying nothing significant on cross-border terrorism. 
That gives some idea of the dimensions of Mr Powell's ""moment of opportunity"". As Mr Armitage said when he was asked by the BBC about the prospect of the region becoming nuclear-free, ""let's keep our appetites under control"". Rightly said.","Atal Bihari Vajpayee's bold appeal for peace needs to produce results quickly 
 THE thrill was palpable after the unexpected announcement on May 2nd by Atal Behari Vajpayee , India 's prime minister , that Atal Bihari Vajpayee wanted to start a "" decisive and conclusive dialogue "" aimed at ending the decades of hostility between his country and Pakistan . Zafarullah Jamali , Pakistan 's prime minister , smartly responded with a ten - minute telephone call to Atal Bihari Vajpayee , and a letter which talked about curbing terrorism and proposed a summit in Islamabad . Colin Powell , America 's secretary of state , saw a "" moment of opportunity where both sides seem to be reaching out . "" Not to be outdone , General Pervez Musharraf , Pakistan 's president and Mr Jamali 's boss , weighed in , dusting off old ideas for a non - aggression pact and the de - nuclearisation of the subcontinent . 
 Suddenly it seemed that these two nuclear powers might be on the verge of substantive talks . By the middle of this week , however , they were already bickering over the details , underlining the sad truth that an early summit is unlikely , and that it could be years before real progress is made . But even such squabbling is an improvement on the stand - off that developed after India blamed Pakistan for helping to facilitate terrorist atrocities , including a suicide attack on its Parliament in December 2001 . The main advance is that , as suggested by Atal Bihari Vajpayee , both countries are to reappoint high commissioners ( the Commonwealth 's equivalent of ambassadors ) to each other 's capitals ; and it looks as if air links may be resumed soon . 
 America insists that the Atal Bihari Vajpayee initiative came as a pleasant surprise , not least for Richard Armitage , the deputy secretary of state , who has been in the region all this week on what was planned as a damage - limitation exercise . There have been fears for months that a fresh terrorist attack in India might lead to more sabre - rattling and possibly a border confrontation . At the end of March , both countries tested nuclear - capable missiles a day after India blamed Pakistan for the massacre of 24 Hindus in Kashmir and the assassination of a local moderate political leader . Instead , Mr Armitage 's job now has been firstly to encourage Pakistan to respond positively to Atal Bihari Vajpayee , while curbing its support for cross - border terrorism in Kashmir , and secondly to urge India to be patient in its dealings with its neighbour . 
 In part , both countries have been taking up positions that would put them in a good light before meeting Mr Armitage . In the case of Pakistan , General Musharraf 's meeting with President George Bush in Washington next month will also have played a part . But the Indian moves go deeper . They were taken on the personal initiative of Atal Bihari Vajpayee's "" third and final "" effort for peace . Atal Bihari Vajpayee's earlier efforts , in February 1999 and July 2001 , had ended in failure that did Atal Bihari Vajpayee's image no good at all . 
 But at 78 , Atal Bihari Vajpayee , wants to carve out a niche in history . Indian diplomats say Atal Bihari Vajpayee believes the international situation has changed since the Iraq war , and that India and Pakistan are obliged to make a fresh bid for peace . Atal Bihari Vajpayee also felt that India had painted itself into a corner by refusing to talk to Pakistan until it had put a complete end to cross - border terrorism , and that this stance could not be sustained indefinitely . 
 Atal Bihari Vajpayee consulted very few cabinet colleagues before Atal Bihari Vajpayee's statement on May 2nd . Atal Bihari Vajpayee went ahead despite the scepticism of senior ministers such as L.K. Advani , the deputy prime minister . Leaders of Atal Bihari Vajpayee's Bharatiya Janata Party ( BJP ) also oppose the initiative , partly because they do not believe anything will be achieved , but mainly because they want to play up what they believe are vote - winning fears of Pakistan - aided terrorism during state elections this autumn and in a general election next year . But Atal Bihari Vajpayee's stature is such that opposition has melted away in the past week and , for now , Atal Bihari Vajpayee is free to pursue Atal Bihari Vajpayee's initiative , supported even by the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh ( RSS ) , the BJP 's hardline - Hindu sister organisation .

INDIA'S prime minister, Atal Behari Vajpayee, is something of a poet as well as a devout Hindu. His spiritual and aesthetic reserves will be tested to the full this weekend, as he arrives on a state visit to China. Over the following five days, he will be confronted with the full extent of India's failure to keep pace with its neighbour. Twenty-five years ago, living standards in the two dirt-poor Asian giants were similar, but now the average Chinese is nearly twice as well-off as his Indian neighbour. This huge discrepancy manifests itself at every level: from the glittering new airports and business centres of Beijing and Shanghai, which Mr Vajpayee will have sadly to compare with the outmoded squalor of Delhi and Mumbai, to the rate of adult illiteracy, which is almost three times higher in India than in China, to the awful fact that twice as many Indian as Chinese babies die in infancy.
The world's leaders know it: no American president can afford to stay away from the Middle Kingdom for long, but in 2000, Bill Clinton became the first occupant of the White House to go to India for 22 years, and President Bush has not yet set a date for following him. Pakistan, not India, is back in favour as the partner of choice in South Asia, a tilt so profound as to explain, many insiders believe, the recent early resignation of the American ambassador to Delhi. For Mr Vajpayee, who once said that his life's ambition was to see India take its place as a great nation, it must be very dispiriting.
Discuss this yawning gulf with any Chinese official, and the chances are that he or she will blame it on India's democracy. The chaos and compromise of the legislative process, one will generally hear, militates against the possibility of firm government. Had he depended on a parliamentary majority, or re-election, goes the argument, Deng Xiaoping could never have launched China's economic reforms as he did in 1978, with the consequent sharp increase in unemployment, as rusty old state-owned businesses suddenly faced competition from sprightlier private ones. Even in India, one sometimes hears defeatist talk of this kind ()see page 65. 
Don't blame democracy
Fortunately for democrats, it is not hard to supply a rebuttal. Democracies are not all of a piece, and there are many ways in which India is not a very good one. Corruption in the political and bureaucratic system is endemic. The rule of law is constrained by a creaking and overwhelmed judicial system. The caste system prevents hundreds of millions of Indians from having their needs and demands heard and acted upon. Moreover, until very recently, India didn't even look much like a true democracy at all: it more closely resembled a one-party state, run by the Congress party, whose socialist ideology, laid down by Jawarharlal Nehru, was deeply hostile to free enterprise and interfered in the economic life of the nation to an extent that was almost as destructive as Mao's communism.
None of the weaknesses in India's version of democracy is inherent in the notion of democracy itself, and all of them are perfectly fixable without having to throw the idea of democracy overboard. Besides, it would be unwise to be too starry-eyed about China's economy. India remains streets ahead of China in the lucrative area of software and other information-based services, where the free flow of knowledge matters more, and where the Chinese government's control-freakery is much more of a handicap. Nor, by focusing only on economics, can it be right to ignore the huge disadvantages the Chinese endure by living under totalitarian rule. Among these should be counted the fact that China's political structure is inherently inflexible, and is constantly at risk of falling apart in any number of ways, some of them--remember Tiananmen Square in 1989--quite bloody. Democracies tend to be more resilient, more able to absorb dissent and conflict.
But if democracy or the lack of it is not the root cause of India's divergence from China, what is? Mostly, as already noted, that India simply started the process of opening up later. Indians used to joke that the British raj had given way to the licence raj: even the smallest investment decision by a private firm required government approval, very often all the way from Delhi. The work of dismantling this bureaucratic behemoth started only in 1991 under a reformist finance minister, Manmohan Singh--there was no reason why it could not have started earlier, bar the absence of sufficiently intelligent or brave leadership--and pockets of resistance remain. One particular anomaly is the system that reserves extensive sectors of the economy for small businesses. China's reforms have had 12 years longer to deal with such obstacles.
There are other reasons, too. In the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), India is, for the moment, saddled with an irresponsible government that is better at pandering to religious zealotry than pressing for economic reform, and which is led by people who are hardly in their first flush of enthusiastic youth (Mr Vajpayee will be 80 next year, when he fully intends to fight a general election: his finance minister, who ought to be galvanising the reform process, is 65). The Congress party is little better: it is led by the ineffectual Sonia Gandhi, who has proved incapable of making the case for continuing the reforms her own party started. A well-led Congress government would potentially enjoy all sorts of advantages that the BJP lacks. Because the BJP is primarily a northern-Indian phenomenon, it is forced to rely on an unwieldy coalition, which currently consists of 20-odd parties, to remain in power. That is hardly a recipe for effective leadership.
Beyond this is India's permanent state of near-war, and nuclear war at that, with its neighbour Pakistan, over its benighted possession, Kashmir. India's uneasy relations with China, which prompt it to invest wastefully in nuclear weapons and long-range missiles, do not help either. If Mr Vajpayee is serious about India taking its place, alongside China, as a great nation, he could start with a few bold gestures over Kashmir. It would be greatly to China's advantage to help, by pushing Pakistan, perhaps the closest of all its foreign friends, to make a genuine effort to halt violence there. A billion Indians, as well as the wider region, would be the winners.","India is weaker thanks not to democracy , but to bureaucracy , intolerance and pointless rivalries

FOR the past week, with more to come, the leading hawks of India and Pakistan have been trading accusations while travelling to and from America and Britain. L.K. Advani, India's deputy prime minister, met George Bush and other top politicians in Washington, and then saw Tony Blair in London, where he was followed quickly by General Pervez Musharraf, Pakistan's president. The general, moving in the opposite direction to Mr Advani, is in Washington next week, where he expects to pick up further economic and military rewards in return for his help against al-Qaeda. Meanwhile, Atal Bihari Vajpayee, India's prime minister, who launched a peace initiative with Pakistan in mid-April, will be visiting China, Pakistan's leading international ally, seeking help against Pakistan-aided terrorism in the disputed northern region of Kashmir.
At times, it has sounded as if the Vajpayee initiative is on the rocks. After General Musharraf appeared, a week ago, to threaten a repeat of the mini-war between the two countries at Kargil three years ago, Mr Vajpayee gave warning that Pakistan seemed to be preparing for its ""fourth defeat"" at the hands of Indian troops. Mr Advani accused Pakistan of being an ""epicentre of terrorism"" and a hotbed for al-Qaeda. General Musharraf claimed that Indian Kashmiris did not want to live in India. Both sides also repeated 55-year-old claims for all the other side's territory in Kashmir, ignoring the current focus on the Indian-controlled Srinagar Valley.
Despite all this, some progress is being made. Both sides are still up for reopening an Amritsar-Lahore cross-border bus route on July 1st. Pakistan's new high commissioner is expected to arrive in Delhi by the end of June and India's high commissioner should be in Islamabad by the middle of July. There are exchange visits by delegations of parliamentarians and businessmen planned. But flights between the two countries have not been restored, possibly because Pakistan does not want to help India develop air links with Afghanistan and Iran by granting overflight rights; and there has been no progress on restoring trade or rail links.
India is not willing to move further until it is convinced that Pakistan has stopped helping terrorists cross the ""line of control"" that divides the two countries in Kashmir. India seems unlikely to agree to a formal meeting between foreign secretaries during a South Asian regional conference in Kathmandu next month, which Pakistan would like. India rejects Mr Musharraf's claim that he has put a stop to border-crossing by terrorists, and that their camps have been dismantled. It says that infiltration has not been reduced. The death toll remains high: nearly 450 people, civilians as well as soliders, have been killed since Mr Vajpayee's peace initiative started.
At home in Pakistan, General Musharraf is under pressure both from the increasingly popular Islamic parties and from his own army. He is therefore insisting on what he calls ""reciprocation"" from India. Without it, he told the BBC this week, his critics would blame his government for a ""sell-out"" of Kashmir. He even hinted they might ""turn their guns"" against him.
Perhaps the most hopeful sign is that, in India, Mr Vajpayee seems to have public opinion with him in trying to make peace with Pakistan. Despite scepticism within his Bharatiya Janata Party, and even though there is no prospect of a Kashmir settlement in the foreseeable future, the BJP seems content to let the prime minister's peace initiative continue. There is still every chance that, like so many others, it will not lead anywhere, but its mere existence could improve the party's prospects in the state elections due this autumn and the general election next year.

SOME comparisons are stark enough to generate a national inferiority complex. In 1980, India had about 687m people, 300m fewer than China. Living standards, as measured by purchasing power per head, were roughly the same. Then, as China embraced modernity with a sometimes ugly but burning passion, it left India behind. In the next 21 years, India outperformed its neighbour in almost nothing but population growth. 
By 2001, India had 1,033m people against China's 1,272m. But China's national income per head, according to the World Bank, was $890, nearly double India's $450. Adjusted for purchasing power, the Chinese were still 70% wealthier than Indians were. In the ten years from 1992, India's GDP per head grew at 4.3% a year, China's twice as fast. Some 5% of Chinese now live below the national poverty line, compared with 29% of Indians. 
Economic strength begets strategic clout. An accident of history made China one of the five permanent, veto-wielding members of the United Nations Security Council, but that seat now seems to belong to it as of right. India, feeling it should have one too, is just one of a number of big countries with a claim, and laments its comparative geopolitical weakness. As Raja Mohan writes in a new book on Indian foreign policy*, ""In all the new comparisons between the two Asian neighbours who entered the modern world at around the same time, India appeared to fall behind in every single indicator of national power and social prosperity.""
Many Indian businessmen, politicians and even diplomats now often ask westerners, in an aggrieved tone, why the West is so obsessed with China's economic success. But the obsession is India's, too. Comparison with China has become a distorting mirror in which Indians see their country's shortcomings grotesquely magnified. Many are looking at--often misunderstood--versions of the ""Chinese model"", to see what India can learn. 
For Indians, the ""Chinese threat"" comes in at least three forms: the geopolitical panic that rivalry with China may one day lead to another war between them; the economic nightmare of an India of underemployed farm labourers spending their meagre earnings on imported Chinese goods; and the ideological doubt that maybe India's heroic experiment with democracy has exacted an even higher price than has China's erratic dictatorship.
Bye-bye, Bhai Bhai
This was not the way Jawaharlal Nehru planned it. India's relations with China are still scarred by the bitterness that ended its first prime minister's dream of Hindi-Chini Bhai Bhai, Indo-Chinese brotherhood, sealed in a treaty in 1954. Sibling tension soon surfaced, and sharpened when India gave sanctuary in 1959 to the Dalai Lama and 100,000 of his followers as they fled China's suppression of an uprising in Tibet. It ended, in humiliating betrayal for Mr Nehru and India, in the war of 1962. 
In the late 1950s the Chinese army was found to have built a road across what India regarded as part of Ladakh, in its state of Jammu and Kashmir. It met Indian protests with a territorial claim of its own, far to the east, to what is now the state of Arunachal Pradesh. A brief war fought on three fronts resulted in a comprehensive Chinese victory. China invaded in the east, mostly for effect, before withdrawing a month later to the ""line of actual control"".
It took a quarter of a century for relations to return to something like normal. In 1988 the two prime ministers, Rajiv Gandhi and Li Peng, agreed to set the border dispute to one side. Since then there have been 14 meetings of a joint working group set up to tackle it. Although its energies have been directed mainly to deciding the extent of the dispute--ie, where the line of actual control should run--rather than solving it, the process has allowed what look like cordial relations to develop. Last year Zhu Rongji, then Chinese prime minister, came to India, and his Indian counterpart, Atal Behari Vajpayee, will repay the visit this weekend. On many international issues--such as the war in Iraq--the two countries agree. Bilateral trade has grown from a paltry $338m in 1992 to nearly $5 billion in 2002. 
At times, the mask of mutual respect slips. When India exploded a nuclear bomb in 1998, its defence minister, George Fernandes, let it be known that the arsenal was needed not so much because of Pakistan's nuclear ambitions as because of the long-term threat from China. It was certainly true that India's nuclear programme, started in the mid-1960s, was a response to its defeat in the 1962 war and to China's acquisition of the bomb two years later. Even this year, the present foreign minister, Yashwant Sinha, felt he needed to debunk theories of ""the inevitability of conflict"" between the two countries.
China's rapprochement with India has been complicated by its relations with Pakistan. Mr Vajpayee has now embarked on his ""third and final"" attempt to build a lasting peace with Pakistan, despite the two countries' dispute over Kashmir. He is hoping that China will be a moderating influence on Pakistan's generals. But with India still providing hospitality to the Dalai Lama, and China refusing to recognise India's incorporation of Sikkim in 1975 as a state of the Indian union, there is plenty besides the border wrangle to keep the two countries wary of each other.
Mr Mohan argues that, despite these remaining hang-ups, India is now ready for ""comprehensive engagement"" with China. For some Indian pundits, however, the clouds are still thick. In March, in India's Outlook magazine, Rajinder Puri analysed the peace process aimed at ending the Maoist rebellion in Nepal. His conclusion: ""The Chinese plan to encircle India with its proxies is near completion."" The Maoists, he said, had a ""neat plan to make South Asia China's vassal."" This is an extreme expression of what Uday Bhaskar, of the Institute of Defence Studies and Analyses in Delhi, says is undeniable: that ""Chinese influence on the Indian periphery""--Pakistan, Bangladesh, Myanmar, Nepal and even Sri Lanka--has increased. 
A widely held belief colours Indian analysis of China's economic policies as well as its diplomacy: that Beijing has a grand and cunning plan, which survives all its political turmoil. India, in contrast, is an amiable, bumbling and inconsistent improviser. Mr Puri wound up his column with a little rhyme: ""China moves events; India moves files. China never relents; India only smiles.""
Tell me it isn't true
Many Indian businessmen and policymakers react to evidence of China's superior economic performance first with denial, and then with anger. Denial takes the form of an assault on the factual basis of the comparison: China, it is well known, stir-fries its books, and India, suffering in comparison, is the victim of geopolitical statistical fraud. The two Chinese numbers most subject to suspicion are, first, its spectacular GDP growth rates and, second, the gargantuan amounts of foreign direct investment (FDI) that China claims to attract.
It is true that both sets of figures are highly dubious. For many years, for example, China's growth figures simply have not added up: aggregated provincial data produce a higher annual growth rate than the national one (which, hardly inviting confidence, is usually published before the end of the year in question). Even some national data--on energy consumption, say, or freight volumes--are inconsistent with such rapid growth.
China's and India's relative success in attracting FDI represents the sharpest contrast of all between the two countries. According to the official data, China received $52.7 billion last year; India got just 4% of that amount, $2.3 billion. Again, some Indian economists have cried foul. India's figures are understated, they say, because they exclude foreigners' reinvested profits, the proceeds of foreign stockmarket listings, intra-company loans, trade credits, financial leases and so on. China's, on the other hand, are inflated by ""round-tripping"" of domestic investment through Hong Kong.
On both counts, there is little doubt that the statistics flatter China. Many economists argue that its growth figures overstate the truth by one or two percentage points. As for FDI, Sadhana Srivastava, in an article in India's Economic and Political Weekly, has recalculated both India's and China's figures for the year 2000 to make a fairer comparison. He found that China's FDI fell by half, while India's more than tripled. This meant that, as a percentage of GDP, there was not much difference: 1.7% for India against 2% for China.
However, even on this basis, India was still attracting just 40% of the amount of foreign investment that went to China. Much of the gap is attributable to the activities of overseas Chinese--in Taiwan, Hong Kong, South-East Asia and America. They have ploughed far more of their money back into the motherland than have non-resident Indians, despite Indians' economic success in many countries. 
Making things better
Nor, statistical quibbling aside, can there be much argument about the relative pace of growth fuelled by such investment. Some parts of India--Bangalore and Hyderabad, for example, or the industrial outskirts of Delhi--display the same feverish building that is under way in China. But in comparison with the massive construction site that is China's eastern seaboard, they seem like isolated pockets. China's growth may be patchy, localised and exaggerated. But all the evidence of the senses suggests that it is far faster than India's.
That is especially true of industrial growth, and above all of manufacturing, which in 2002 made up just 15% of India's GDP, compared with 35% of China's. Indian manufacturers scratch their heads in bafflement at China's ability to undercut them. Rahul Gupta, managing director of Phoenix Lamps, a lighting-products firm employing 1,300 people near Delhi, says that whenever he comes up against Chinese competition, he finds that the Chinese price is no more than the cost of Phoenix's raw materials. 
He blames this, in part, on hidden support in the form of subsidised raw materials; ""huge amounts of unpaid receivables""; the absence of any concept of earning a return on capital invested; and export subsidies, which, in his business, he calculates to be worth 17% of the price. Phoenix, he says, simply cannot compete, and has retreated altogether from some products and some markets in Europe and South America. But customers, he thinks, will soon realise how shoddy Chinese products are. 
In a similar vein, another Indian firm, Paper Products, a Pune-based maker of packaging for big Indian companies and multinationals, sees, in the words of its boss, Suresh Gupta, ""zero threat"" from China. The Chinese, he says, are good at selling standardised commodities--which his company buys, causing grief for Indian suppliers--but are poor at ""bespoke"" products, such as unique packaging.
Both firms' experiences are commonplace. A report commissioned by the Confederation of Indian Industry, a national lobby organisation, sought to explode what it said were five widespread Indian myths about China: that its growth stems entirely from investment, not improvements in productivity; that manufacturing is driven primarily by exports; that low Chinese prices are the result of flawed accounting; that exports are priced more or less at cost; and that Chinese products are shoddy{dagger}. Indian industry, it seems, suffers from a curious mixture of panic and complacency about China.
The report found that neither is justified. It explains lower Chinese prices largely in terms of a tedious accumulation of minor cost disadvantages borne by Indian industry (see chart 2 on previous page). The biggest, accounting for as much as half the difference, are sales and excise taxes, followed by the cost of capital. India's much higher import duties--a trade-weighted average of around 24% compared with China's 13%--also push up the cost of inputs. The price of copper, for example, is 25% higher in India than in China.
If the report is right that the roots of Chinese manufacturing superiority lie in the fiscal and legal framework, that might worsen Indian industry's sense of inadequacy. But it also means that policy changes could do much to help India catch up: cutting import duties; simplifying and cutting indirect taxes by introducing a nationwide value-added tax (VAT); reducing the list of industries ""reserved"" for small companies; reforming the power industry by breaking down the state electricity boards into separate generation, transmission and distribution companies; easing labour laws to make hiring and firing and the use of contract workers easier. Indeed some of these reforms are already, slowly, under way, or at least under consideration.
But almost all of them are politically difficult. Bringing in a national VAT, for example, has been postponed three times, most recently this month, after state governments failed to lay the groundwork. In a number of places, the proposed tax was resisted by merchants, who shut shops in protest. With state and general elections looming, the government was loth to antagonise them. Not only do their votes matter; they can also be a vital source of party funds and, with their strike threats, of irritation to other voters. Typical, say reformists, of the political obstacles India faces.
China as a model?
""We must import either Chinese products"", according to one gloomy Indian manufacturer, ""or the Chinese model."" Many Indians believe that a large part of the blame for their country's inferior economic performance must be borne by the political system. China, the argument goes, is a dictatorship where the government and the businesses it favours can do what they want--change laws, build infrastructure, secure licences, fiddle their books--all without brooking any opposition. In India, however, not only does every step require dealing with an inept, corrupt and intrusive bureaucracy, but the democratic system itself also imposes extra costs and delays. For every important and helpful reform, such as VAT, there is a powerful lobby that will oppose it.
Some make this argument in a spirit of pride: slower economic growth is a price worth paying for democratic freedom. For others it is an analysis of despair: what poor, backward India needs is less democracy and more discipline. 
Such a political comparison, however, contains many misperceptions. First, as those who have done business in China know, decision-making there is far less monolithic, far more ponderous, far more erratic and far more prone to profiteering by rent-seeking officials than it appears to some envious Indians. 
Second, much that holds India's economy and businesses back has little to do with democracy as such: corruption, fiscal mismanagement, a lack of international ambition and a history of over-protection at home. Where India overcomes these obstacles, and has a clear competitive advantage--as in software and other information-technology services--it can be a huge success. Indian firms such as Tata Consultancy Services and Wipro leave their Chinese rivals far behind, and are preparing to compete with the best multinationals.
The way India's democracy has evolved has undoubtedly complicated policymaking. Coalition governments give disproportionate power to regional and caste-based minority parties. Worse, the electoral timetable, with many important states holding polls between the national votes, tends to put governments into cautious, electioneering mode for much of their time in office.
Yet these handicaps should not be exaggerated. The political system does offer the hope that a party might aim over the heads of sectoral-interest groups to the aspirations of all Indians for a better life. Already, Indians have the enormous benefit of being able to turf out a government that performs appallingly. India may not have had a Communist Party-led boom, but nor has it endured a Cultural Revolution or a Great Leap Forward. Indians may also have the chance, one day, of being able to elect a government that does the right things. Some of them would involve, in Mr Mohan's phrase, moving from ""envy to emulation"" of China. In terms of the political system itself, however, the envy and emulation should go the other way.

Caption: Democracies can excel, too","As India 's prime minister goes to China , Indians should learn that they have less to fear from their giant neighbour than they think 
 SOME comparisons are stark enough to generate a national inferiority complex . In 1980 , India had about 687 m people , 300 m fewer than China . Living standards , as measured by purchasing power per head , were roughly the same . Then , as China embraced modernity with a sometimes ugly but burning passion , it left India behind . In the next 21 years , India outperformed its neighbour in almost nothing but population growth . 
 By 2001 , India had 1,033 m people against China 's 1,272 m. But China 's national income per head , according to the World Bank , was $ 890 , nearly double India 's $ 450 . Adjusted for purchasing power , the Chinese were still 70 % wealthier than Indians were . In the ten years from 1992 , India 's GDP per head grew at 4.3 % a year , China 's twice as fast . Some 5 % of Chinese now live below the national poverty line , compared with 29 % of Indians . 
 Economic strength begets strategic clout . An accident of history made China one of the five permanent , veto - wielding members of the United Nations Security Council , but that seat now seems to belong to it as of right . India , feeling it should have one too , is just one of a number of big countries with a claim , and laments its comparative geopolitical weakness . As Raja Mohan writes in a new book on Indian foreign policy * , "" In all the new comparisons between the two Asian neighbours who entered the modern world at around the same time , India appeared to fall behind in every single indicator of national power and social prosperity . "" 
 Many Indian businessmen , politicians and even diplomats now often ask westerners , in an aggrieved tone , why the West is so obsessed with China 's economic success . But the obsession is India 's , too . Comparison with China has become a distorting mirror in which Indians see their country 's shortcomings grotesquely magnified . Many are looking at -- often misunderstood -- versions of the "" Chinese model "" , to see what India can learn . 
 For Indians , the "" Chinese threat "" comes in at least three forms : the geopolitical panic that rivalry with China may one day lead to another war between them ; the economic nightmare of an India of underemployed farm labourers spending their meagre earnings on imported Chinese goods ; and the ideological doubt that maybe India 's heroic experiment with democracy has exacted an even higher price than has China 's erratic dictatorship . 
 Bye - bye , Bhai Bhai 
 This was not the way Jawaharlal Nehru planned it . India 's relations with China are still scarred by the bitterness that ended its first prime minister 's dream of Hindi - Chini Bhai Bhai , Indo - Chinese brotherhood , sealed in a treaty in 1954 . Sibling tension soon surfaced , and sharpened when India gave sanctuary in 1959 to the Dalai Lama and 100,000 of his followers as they fled China 's suppression of an uprising in Tibet . It ended , in humiliating betrayal for Mr Nehru and India , in the war of 1962 . 
 In the late 1950s the Chinese army was found to have built a road across what India regarded as part of Ladakh , in its state of Jammu and Kashmir . It met Indian protests with a territorial claim of its own , far to the east , to what is now the state of Arunachal Pradesh . A brief war fought on three fronts resulted in a comprehensive Chinese victory . China invaded in the east , mostly for effect , before withdrawing a month later to the "" line of actual control "" . 
 It took a quarter of a century for relations to return to something like normal . In 1988 the two prime ministers , Rajiv Gandhi and Li Peng , agreed to set the border dispute to one side . Since then there have been 14 meetings of a joint working group set up to tackle it . Although its energies have been directed mainly to deciding the extent of the dispute -- ie , where the line of actual control should run -- rather than solving it , the process has allowed what look like cordial relations to develop . Last year Zhu Rongji , then Chinese prime minister , came to India , and Atal Bihari Vajpayee's , will repay the visit this weekend . On many international issues -- such as the war in Iraq -- the two countries agree . Bilateral trade has grown from a paltry $ 338 m in 1992 to nearly $ 5 billion in 2002 . 
 At times , the mask of mutual respect slips . When India exploded a nuclear bomb in 1998 , its defence minister , George Fernandes , let it be known that the arsenal was needed not so much because of Pakistan 's nuclear ambitions as because of the long - term threat from China . It was certainly true that India 's nuclear programme , started in the mid-1960s , was a response to its defeat in the 1962 war and to China 's acquisition of the bomb two years later . Even this year , the present foreign minister , Yashwant Sinha , felt he needed to debunk theories of "" the inevitability of conflict "" between the two countries . 
 China 's rapprochement with India has been complicated by its relations with Pakistan . Atal Bihari Vajpayee has now embarked on Atal Bihari Vajpayee's "" third and final "" attempt to build a lasting peace with Pakistan , despite the two countries ' dispute over Kashmir . Atal Bihari Vajpayee is hoping that China will be a moderating influence on Pakistan 's generals . But with India still providing hospitality to the Dalai Lama , and China refusing to recognise India 's incorporation of Sikkim in 1975 as a state of the Indian union , there is plenty besides the border wrangle to keep the two countries wary of each other . 
 Mr Mohan argues that , despite these remaining hang - ups , India is now ready for "" comprehensive engagement "" with China . For some Indian pundits , however , the clouds are still thick . In March , in India 's Outlook magazine , Rajinder Puri analysed the peace process aimed at ending the Maoist rebellion in Nepal . His conclusion : "" The Chinese plan to encircle India with its proxies is near completion . "" The Maoists , he said , had a "" neat plan to make South Asia China 's vassal . "" This is an extreme expression of what Uday Bhaskar , of the Institute of Defence Studies and Analyses in Delhi , says is undeniable : that "" Chinese influence on the Indian periphery""--Pakistan , Bangladesh , Myanmar , Nepal and even Sri Lanka -- has increased . 
 A widely held belief colours Indian analysis of China 's economic policies as well as its diplomacy : that Beijing has a grand and cunning plan , which survives all its political turmoil . India , in contrast , is an amiable , bumbling and inconsistent improviser . Mr Puri wound up his column with a little rhyme : "" China moves events ; India moves files . China never relents ; India only smiles . "" 
 Tell me it is n't true 
 Many Indian businessmen and policymakers react to evidence of China 's superior economic performance first with denial , and then with anger .

JUST five years ago, India's defence minister described China as India's biggest threat. The visit to China this week of Atal Behari Vajpayee, the first by an Indian head of government in a decade, suggests a thaw is well under way.
No one was expecting Mr Vajpayee's six-day tour, due to end on June 27th, to make any dramatic breakthrough on the main point of contention, namely the delineation of the 2,200 mile (3,500km) common border. This dispute, aggravated by India's harbouring of Tibet's exiled leader, the Dalai Lama, triggered a brief war in 1962. But the two sides have now appointed senior officials to pep up negotiations. They also expressed eagerness to work on other aspects of the relationship, especially trade. Though rapidly expanding, this amounted to a mere $5 billion last year, compared with $97 billion between China and America, according to China's figures.
The two sides agreed to a new border crossing for trade between Tibet and the Himalayan territory of Sikkim, which India annexed in 1975. China has never recognised India's claim to Sikkim, but the agreement could be construed as a tacit recognition by China that Sikkim is part of India. For its part, India referred to Tibet in writing as the Tibet Autonomous Region--China's name for it--which the Chinese claimed was the first time India had explicitly recognised the ""autonomous region"" as part of China. Both sides insisted their positions had not really changed, though on such sensitive issues, that was no surprise.
India's cosying up to China is unlikely to have much impact on China's close relationship with Pakistan. China may have adopted a more neutral position on the Kashmir issue in recent years, but it still sees Pakistan as an important ally--partly as a buffer against India but also because a hostile Pakistan would be well placed to stir up trouble among restive Muslims in China's far west. Mr Vajpayee did complain that Pakistan was not doing enough to curb insurgents in Kashmir. But not a word has been uttered in public, at least, about China's military aid to Pakistan, including what India suspects was covert support for Pakistan's nuclear-weapons programme. India is not about to let that old grievance ruin a blossoming friendship.

IT ALMOST feels like the old days in Srinagar, the summer capital of the disputed Indian state of Jammu and Kashmir where at least 40,000 people have been killed since an insurgency began 14 years ago. Tourists have returned. Nearly 70,000 have come in the past six months to stay in houseboats on the city's Dal Lake and tour the surrounding mountains, more than double the number in the whole of last year. Troops are slightly less evident in the streets, and the government will soon sanction a mobile-phone service that has been denied for years by security fears. Moderate separatist leaders, as well as mainstream politicians, are talking more positively than before about the need for an end to militancy. People, they say, need to begin to rebuild their lives.
Mehbooba Mufti, president of the People's Democratic Party, which has led the state's coalition government since last October, credits the change partly to a visit in April by Atal Behari Vajpayee, India's prime minister, when he offered a ""hand of friendship"" to Pakistan. The ""jinx was broken,"" says Ms Mehbooba. An unprecedented three-day visit to the state last weekend by India's relaxed president, A.P.J. Abdul Kalam (above), also ""brought a sense of belonging and security.""
But real peace is a long way off. On the day in June when Mr Kalam visited the border that separates Indian and Pakistani Kashmir, known as the line of control (LoC), 12 Indian soldiers were killed in a suicide attack on an army camp at Sunjwan, near Jammu, 400km (250 miles) to the south. The attack triggered memories of the killing of 34 people, soldiers and members of their families, in May last year, when India and Pakistan came close to war. But militants frequently stage atrocities to coincide with important visits, and the government reacted relatively calmly.
George Fernandes, India's defence minister, claimed that Pakistan's Inter-Services Intelligence agency was responsible for the attack, which Pakistan denied. But Mr Vajpayee's peace moves would continue. Senior Indian army and police officers say that militants continue to cross into Indian Kashmir from Pakistan, but they believe that Pakistan is trying to curb major terrorist attacks. The question for India is what it should do next to bring permanent peace. There is a growing desire among Kashmiris for an end to the killings, but also for some autonomy from India's central government. 
The neatest solution would be for Pakistan to accept the LoC, agreed between the two countries in 1972, as the permanent border and for India to restore to Kashmir most of the high degree of regional autonomy that it had for six years after India gained independence in 1947.
But Pakistan says it seeks all of Kashmir, which has a Muslim majority, and India has never seemed willing to move on the autonomy issue. Many observers believe India would prefer to tolerate unrest, and even terrorism, and keep the LoC as a de facto border, rather than risk a settlement that might give ground to Pakistan and the Kashmiri militants whom it supports. 
Significantly, the Pakistan-backed All-Party Hurriyat Conference, a group of 23 Kashmir-based parties with separatist roots, did not greet Mr Kalam with the day-long hartal (strike) they usually call when Indian leaders visit. This was seen to reflect growing moderation in a group that is struggling to re-establish its diminished credibility.

He predicted that ""within a couple of years we'll be back to normalisation of relations between India and Pakistan,"" with ""the resolution of the situation in Kashmir"". That shows rare optimism but, as Miss Saeed put it, ""people are in a mood for change and, if we don't respond, then we miss the bus. There can't be a better chance than this.""","Not yet peace , but something like it 
 IT ALMOST feels like the old days in Srinagar , the summer capital of the disputed Indian state of Jammu and Kashmir where at least 40,000 people have been killed since an insurgency began 14 years ago . Tourists have returned . Nearly 70,000 have come in the past six months to stay in houseboats on the city 's Dal Lake and tour the surrounding mountains , more than double the number in the whole of last year . Troops are slightly less evident in the streets , and the government will soon sanction a mobile - phone service that has been denied for years by security fears . Moderate separatist leaders , as well as mainstream politicians , are talking more positively than before about the need for an end to militancy . People , they say , need to begin to rebuild their lives . 
 Mehbooba Mufti , president of the People 's Democratic Party , which has led the state 's coalition government since last October , credits the change partly to a visit in April by Atal Bihari Vajpayee's , when Atal Bihari Vajpayee offered a "" hand of friendship "" to Pakistan . The "" jinx was broken , "" says Ms Mehbooba . An unprecedented three - day visit to the state last weekend by India 's relaxed president , A.P.J. Abdul Kalam ( above ) , also "" brought a sense of belonging and security . "" 
 But real peace is a long way off . On the day in June when Mr Kalam visited the border that separates Indian and Pakistani Kashmir , known as the line of control ( LoC ) , 12 Indian soldiers were killed in a suicide attack on an army camp at Sunjwan , near Jammu , 400 km ( 250 miles ) to the south . The attack triggered memories of the killing of 34 people , soldiers and members of their families , in May last year , when India and Pakistan came close to war . But militants frequently stage atrocities to coincide with important visits , and the government reacted relatively calmly . 
 George Fernandes , India 's defence minister , claimed that Pakistan 's Inter - Services Intelligence agency was responsible for the attack , which Pakistan denied . But Atal Bihari Vajpayee's peace moves would continue . Senior Indian army and police officers say that militants continue to cross into Indian Kashmir from Pakistan , but they believe that Pakistan is trying to curb major terrorist attacks . The question for India is what it should do next to bring permanent peace . There is a growing desire among Kashmiris for an end to the killings , but also for some autonomy from India 's central government . 
 The neatest solution would be for Pakistan to accept the LoC , agreed between the two countries in 1972 , as the permanent border and for India to restore to Kashmir most of the high degree of regional autonomy that it had for six years after India gained independence in 1947 . 
 But Pakistan says it seeks all of Kashmir , which has a Muslim majority , and India has never seemed willing to move on the autonomy issue . Many observers believe India would prefer to tolerate unrest , and even terrorism , and keep the LoC as a de facto border , rather than risk a settlement that might give ground to Pakistan and the Kashmiri militants whom it supports . 
 Significantly , the Pakistan - backed All - Party Hurriyat Conference , a group of 23 Kashmir - based parties with separatist roots , did not greet Mr Kalam with the day - long hartal ( strike ) they usually call when Indian leaders visit . This was seen to reflect growing moderation in a group that is struggling to re - establish its diminished credibility . Abdul Gani Bhat , the Hurriyat 's chairman , says that "" the noise of politics has taken over from the role of the gun . "" Mirwaiz Omar Farooq , a young religious leader and political leader , wants militants to "" take a back seat "" but "" remain a pressure group "" .

TRIPS to China by Atal Behari Vajpayee, India's prime minister, seem to be jinxed. In 1979, when he was India's foreign minister, he had to cut short a visit to Beijing when China invaded Vietnam. Now it has emerged that, during a trip to China in June, when he signed a ""comprehensive co-operation"" agreement, an Indian security patrol was being detained by Chinese troops on the mountainous border between India's north-eastern state of Arunachal Pradesh and China. 
The diplomatic flap since this confrontation was leaked in an Indian newspaper on July 24th illustrates the two countries' brittle relationship. A Chinese foreign-ministry spokesman repeated a long-standing refusal to recognise that ""the so-called Arunachal Pradesh"" is part of India, and said the Indian forces ""retreated"" after being detained on what he called the Chinese side of the border. India initially tried to maintain the spirit of the Vajpayee visit and responded less bluntly. But this week a government spokesman said that Arunachal's status was a ""historical fact that cannot be changed by anyone"". India's External Affairs Ministry formally summoned a senior Chinese diplomat in Delhi to complain that the Indian patrol's treatment breached a 1993 ""peace and tranquillity"" agreement that there would be no aggressive acts when patrols met. 
""A little bit of toughness is needed and if that leads to them saying 'no border talks', then fine,"" says J.N. Dixit, a former Indian foreign secretary, who believes that India should deal robustly when challenged by its dominant neighbour. Such an escalation is unlikely because the main focus of the Vajpayee visit, apart from boosting trade, was to begin to tackle differences on the two countries' 4,000 km (2,500 miles) mostly-disputed border, known as the ""line of actual control"" (LAC). In the east, China refuses to accept that Arunachal's 90,000 square kilometres (35,000 square miles) were ceded to India in 1913 by the then-independent Tibet, and it has not recognised India's 1975 annexation of the former kingdom of Sikkim. In the west, India claims a remote mountainous area called Aksai Chin (38,000 square kilometres), which China occupied in its 1962 war against India and regards as strategically important. There are also numerous small pockets of disputed territory. 
China might recognise India's control over Sikkim next year, having agreed during the Vajpayee visit that a trade route should open on the state's Tibet border. But little progress has been made elsewhere. Maps showing the two sides' perceptions of where they think the LAC should be were exchanged for one largely undisputed area last November. Other maps will follow for more difficult areas. But neither side will give away significant pockets of Arunachal or Aksai Chin. Equally, a trade-off, with the LAC becoming permanent, would not be acceptable to India because it lost Aksai Chin in the 1962 war. Overall, India is in more of a hurry than China to fix the border because it would like to move troops to its more volatile frontier with Pakistan. But China is showing no sign of letting it force the pace and, with Pakistan as a strong ally, is presumably happy to tie down the Indian troops where they are.","China detains an Indian patrol

AS IN any feuding family, at times there is a clamour to let bygones be bygones. Indians and Pakistanis, separated at birth 56 years ago, have in recent weeks been warmed by the memory of how much they share, rather than, as so often, chilled by the fear of another war. But so far there is more sentiment than substance to the mood of reconciliation.
The latest appeal for constructive amnesia came from Pakistan's president, Pervez Musharraf, on August 12th. ""Forget Kargil,"" he said, in reference to a small war in 1999, sparked by a Pakistani military adventure, at a time when he was merely the army chief, instead of combining the job, as he does now, with running the country. General Musharraf added an offer of a ceasefire, in which the two armies would stop shelling each other across the ""line of control"" dividing Kashmir. But three explosions in Indian Kashmir the next day were a reminder that such a ceasefire would not stop the violence.
General Musharraf was speaking in Islamabad after meeting an Indian delegation, including 34 members of Parliament, that formed part of a recent flowering of ""people-to-people"" diplomacy. Some of the people are unexpected. The star of the Indian team was Laloo Prasad Yadav, former chief minister of the notoriously misgoverned state of Bihar and now husband to the incumbent. He faces corruption charges, and India's Supreme Court had to order prosecutors to return his passport for the trip. But his folksy style--he champions India's lower castes--went down a treat in Pakistan, where politicians are almost invariably patrician, bearded or in uniform.
Of the bearded clerics, Fazlur Rehman has emerged as an unlikely proponent of reconciliation. He heads an alliance of six religious parties that leads Pakistan's opposition. Mr Rehman also paid a much-publicised peace-mongering trip of his own to India last month.
This flurry of ""track two""--unofficial--diplomacy followed the offer in April by India's prime minister, Atal Behari Vajpayee, of the ""hand of friendship"" to Pakistan. This was doubly surprising: twice before Mr Vajpayee has extended his hand, only to have it bitten (once at Kargil, and once at a summit in Agra); moreover, a hard line towards Pakistan was widely seen as popular in India. 
Yet the prime minister seems to have judged the public mood well. Two stories of cross-border humanitarianism have particularly warmed hearts. Last month, Noor Fatima, a two-year-old Pakistani girl, was treated to heart surgery in the Indian city of Bangalore. And this week, a 13-year-old boy, picked up in India in June after inadvertently straying across the border, was bused back to Pakistan.
The reopening of that bus route was itself evidence of improved relations. Air links, which were also severed after a terrorist attack on India's Parliament in December 2001, may also be resumed soon. Already full diplomatic relations are restored. But, these achievements aside, ""track one"", or official, diplomacy is largely non-existent. There have been no ministerial, let alone summit, meetings between India and Pakistan since before the Delhi attack.
India's immediate dismissal of General Musharraf's ceasefire proposal implies official talks will have to wait. India wants any ceasefire in Kashmir tied to a halt to the cross-border infiltration of Pakistan-based militants, which, it says, continues unabated. Its diplomats believe that, while Pakistan does want closer economic ties, General Musharraf remains hostage to Islamists and his own army. These two forces, intimately linked, will never tolerate any softening of Pakistan's claim to Kashmir, and may eventually sabotage any improvement in relations.
Pakistan's deep-rooted suspicions are the precise mirror image: that all Mr Vajpayee's friendly rhetoric is empty, designed to fob Pakistan off without engaging it on the core of the dispute, Kashmir. As violence continues there, an abrupt end to the current friendly atmosphere could occur at any moment.

THE co-ordinated terrorist onslaught on August 25th on Mumbai, India's commercial capital, was devastating. Two bombs, planted in taxis, exploded within minutes of each other at lunchtime, in parts of the city thronged with office-workers, shopkeepers, sightseers, hawkers and beggars. More than 50 people were killed. The longer-term consequences of this remain murky. At worst, the atrocity might spark a new round of communal blood-letting in India itself, and plunge India's thawing relations with Pakistan back into the icy depths.
The first signs were less discouraging on both fronts. Mumbai's citizens responded to the bombs with fortitude, and with more communal solidarity than antagonism. Within a day, the streets were crowded, the traffic jammed and the stockmarket, after a knee-jerk tumble, had staged an impressive rally. In Pakistan, meanwhile, both the foreign ministry and a leading Islamist party were quick to condemn the slaughter. India refrained from immediate finger-pointing. Talks in Islamabad on resuming air links--severed after an earlier terrorist attack, on the parliament in Delhi in December 2001--went ahead as scheduled on August 27th.
However, India's deputy prime minister, L. K. Advani, a hardliner in the ruling, Hindu nationalist, Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), was less restrained. He portrayed the bombings as part of ""our neighbour's war of terrorism against us"", which, he said, was not limited to Kashmir. Some Muslims were outraged at such a provocative accusation made so prematurely, and without supporting evidence.
The police's prime suspects are affiliates of a banned Indian organisation, known as SIMI (Student Islamic Movement of India), and of Lashkar-e-Taiba, a Pakistan-based militant Islamist group, dedicated to the ""liberation"" of Indian-ruled Kashmir. The police link the attacks to five other bombings in Mumbai in the past eight months. 
The driver of one of the latest bomb-carrying taxis survived, and so the police have some information about his passengers, the presumed culprits. But the timing of the latest bombings, and the absence of any claim of responsibility, have given rise to all manner of theories. It was noticed, for example, that they closely followed similar car bombings in Jakarta, Baghdad and the Caucasus. Lashkar has known al-Qaeda links--a senior al-Qaeda member was arrested at one of its houses in Pakistan--but India's counter-terrorist police are not blaming Osama bin Laden for this attack, except perhaps as a role model.
The bombing also preceded by two days a visit to Kashmir by the prime minister, Atal Behari Vajpayee, for a meeting of chief ministers from Indian states. It was meant to flaunt the region's new-found ""stability"", but was greeted by a series of violent incidents before it opened.
Most strikingly, the Mumbai bombs went off just hours after reports that archaeologists had found some evidence of a tenth-century Hindu temple beneath the site of the 16th-century Babri mosque in the northern town of Ayodhya. The destruction of that mosque in December 1992, by Hindu fanatics, prompted some of India's worst communal violence. However, most observers think the bombing was too well planned to have been an instant response to this boost for Hindu nationalism's most cherished cause. 
The police's initial theory is that it was planned by SIMI associates based in Sharjah and Dubai, and that Pakistan's intelligence service, the ISI, may have had a hand. Based partly on the interrogation of 21 people arrested in connection with the earlier bombings (and assuming that the latest bombs are a continuation of them), they blame a campaign of retribution for last year's anti-Muslim pogrom in the state of Gujarat. Up to 2,000 people were killed, and there is evidence of official connivance in the violence. Mumbai's terrorists' targets have been areas with large Gujarati populations. 
The random slaughter of rich and poor, old and young, Muslim and Hindu is a cruel, haphazard way to exact revenge. But Mumbai's residents have seen it before. On March 12th 1993, 257 people were killed by ten co-ordinated bombs. India blamed the ISI, acting through Mumbai's leading Muslim gangster, Dawood Ibrahim, and other thugs. They were allegedly also taking reprisals for anti-Muslim communal rioting: the killing of more than 900 people in Mumbai following the destruction of the Ayodhya mosque the previous year.
The unfulfilled mission of the destroyers--to build a temple on the site they say marks the birthplace of Ram, a model king and incarnate deity--has haunted Indian politics ever since, poisoning communal relations between Hindus and the Muslim minority. Even the Gujarat violence was related to it: it followed the burning to death of several dozen Hindu activists on a train from Ayodhya. 
The archaeologists' report was ordered by the court hearing an ownership dispute--which has been under way since 1949--about the site in Ayodhya. The reaction of interested parties quickly showed it would do little to end the argument. Muslim groups denied it showed evidence of a temple. But the findings will strengthen those voices in the BJP arguing that the government should legislate for the construction of a temple, and that this should become part of its campaign for next year's general elections.
By the same token, with important state as well as national elections looming, some Indian politicians--such as Mr Advani--may think Pakistan-bashing is a vote-winner. He has already reverted to India's claim (which Pakistan denies) that 19 known terrorists, including Dawood Ibrahim and other alleged perpetrators of the 1993 bombings, are living in Pakistan under ISI patronage. He argues that, until they are handed over, Pakistan's condolences over this week's bloodshed cannot be taken as sincere. 
Tension with Pakistan may suit some Indian politicians. But many analysts believe the ISI, too, has an institutional interest of it own in thwarting reconciliation with India. On both sides of the border, the rapprochement of the past few months has been broadly welcomed. But it may not be as resilient as Mumbai's business-as-usual signs.","Another terrorist massacre in India has raised old questions about Pakistan and Hindu - Muslim relations

Two bombs , planted in taxis , exploded within minutes of each other at lunchtime , in parts of the city thronged with office - workers , shopkeepers , sightseers , hawkers and beggars . More than 50 people were killed . The longer - term consequences of this remain murky . At worst , the atrocity might spark a new round of communal blood - letting in India itself , and plunge India 's thawing relations with Pakistan back into the icy depths . 
 The first signs were less discouraging on both fronts . Mumbai 's citizens responded to the bombs with fortitude , and with more communal solidarity than antagonism . Within a day , the streets were crowded , the traffic jammed and the stockmarket , after a knee - jerk tumble , had staged an impressive rally . In Pakistan , meanwhile , both the foreign ministry and a leading Islamist party were quick to condemn the slaughter . India refrained from immediate finger - pointing . Talks in Islamabad on resuming air links -- severed after an earlier terrorist attack , on the parliament in Delhi in December 2001 - -went ahead as scheduled on August 27th . 
 However , India 's deputy prime minister , L. K. Advani , a hardliner in the ruling , Hindu nationalist , Bharatiya Janata Party ( BJP ) , was less restrained . He portrayed the bombings as part of "" our neighbour 's war of terrorism against us "" , which , he said , was not limited to Kashmir . Some Muslims were outraged at such a provocative accusation made so prematurely , and without supporting evidence . 
 The police 's prime suspects are affiliates of a banned Indian organisation , known as SIMI ( Student Islamic Movement of India ) , and of Lashkar - e - Taiba , a Pakistan - based militant Islamist group , dedicated to the "" liberation "" of Indian - ruled Kashmir . The police link the attacks to five other bombings in Mumbai in the past eight months . 
 The driver of one of the latest bomb - carrying taxis survived , and so the police have some information about his passengers , the presumed culprits . But the timing of the latest bombings , and the absence of any claim of responsibility , have given rise to all manner of theories . It was noticed , for example , that they closely followed similar car bombings in Jakarta , Baghdad and the Caucasus . Lashkar has known al - Qaeda links -- a senior al - Qaeda member was arrested at one of its houses in Pakistan -- but India 's counter - terrorist police are not blaming Osama bin Laden for this attack , except perhaps as a role model . 
 The bombing also preceded by two days Atal Bihari Vajpayee . Atal Bihari Vajpayee was meant to flaunt the region 's new - found "" stability "" , but was greeted by a series of violent incidents before Atal Bihari Vajpayee opened . 
 Most strikingly , the Mumbai bombs went off just hours after reports that archaeologists had found some evidence of a tenth - century Hindu temple beneath the site of the 16th - century Babri mosque in the northern town of Ayodhya . The destruction of that mosque in December 1992 , by Hindu fanatics , prompted some of India 's worst communal violence . However , most observers think the bombing was too well planned to have been an instant response to this boost for Hindu nationalism 's most cherished cause . 
 The police 's initial theory is that it was planned by SIMI associates based in Sharjah and Dubai , and that Pakistan 's intelligence service , the ISI , may have had a hand . Based partly on the interrogation of 21 people arrested in connection with the earlier bombings ( and assuming that the latest bombs are a continuation of them ) , they blame a campaign of retribution for last year 's anti - Muslim pogrom in the state of Gujarat . Up to 2,000 people were killed , and there is evidence of official connivance in the violence . Mumbai 's terrorists ' targets have been areas with large Gujarati populations . 
 The random slaughter of rich and poor , old and young , Muslim and Hindu is a cruel , haphazard way to exact revenge . But Mumbai 's residents have seen it before . On March 12th 1993 , 257 people were killed by ten co - ordinated bombs . India blamed the ISI , acting through Mumbai 's leading Muslim gangster , Dawood Ibrahim , and other thugs . They were allegedly also taking reprisals for anti - Muslim communal rioting : the killing of more than 900 people in Mumbai following the destruction of the Ayodhya mosque the previous year . 
 The unfulfilled mission of the destroyers -- to build a temple on the site they say marks the birthplace of Ram , a model king and incarnate deity -- has haunted Indian politics ever since , poisoning communal relations between Hindus and the Muslim minority . Even the Gujarat violence was related to it : it followed the burning to death of several dozen Hindu activists on a train from Ayodhya . 
 The archaeologists ' report was ordered by the court hearing an ownership dispute -- which has been under way since 1949 - -about the site in Ayodhya . The reaction of interested parties quickly showed it would do little to end the argument . Muslim groups denied it showed evidence of a temple . But the findings will strengthen those voices in the BJP arguing that the government should legislate for the construction of a temple , and that this should become part of its campaign for next year 's general elections . 
 By the same token , with important state as well as national elections looming , some Indian politicians -- such as Mr Advani -- may think Pakistan - bashing is a vote - winner . He has already reverted to India 's claim ( which Pakistan denies ) that 19 known terrorists , including Dawood Ibrahim and other alleged perpetrators of the 1993 bombings , are living in Pakistan under ISI patronage . He argues that , until they are handed over , Pakistan 's condolences over this week 's bloodshed can not be taken as sincere . 
 Tension with Pakistan may suit some Indian politicians . But many analysts believe the ISI , too , has an institutional interest of it own in thwarting reconciliation with India . On both sides of the border , the rapprochement of the past few months has been broadly welcomed . But it may not be as resilient as Mumbai 's business - as - usual signs .",750,India,A29-8257,IN TERM,True,"a visit to Kashmir by the prime minister , Atal Behari Vajpayee , for a meeting of chief ministers from Indian states",3,True

BLESSED with non-stop television news, India is cursed by depressing pictures to fill it. Last weekend they included live coverage of a siege and shoot-out in Srinagar, summer capital of the Indian-controlled state of Jammu and Kashmir. One of those killed by the security forces was later identified as ""Ghazi Baba"". His death had an immediate--and bloody--impact in Kashmir. But for India it was a triumph in its anti-terrorist war, which this week intensified on a number of fronts.
Ghazi Baba was allegedly the commander in Indian Kashmir for Jaish-e-Mohammad, an extremist Islamist group fighting for the area's incorporation into Pakistan. India calls him the ""mastermind"" of a number of atrocities, notably murderous attacks in 2001 on the state assembly in Srinagar and the Parliament in Delhi. 
That was not the only success claimed by India's security forces this week. On September 1st, four people were arrested for involvement in a two-bomb attack in Mumbai a week earlier, in which 52 people were killed. The arrests seemed to bolster police theories about the crime: that, like five other, smaller bombings in Mumbai since last December, it was perpetrated by Muslims in revenge for communal violence in the state of Gujarat last year; that much of the planning had been undertaken in Dubai; and that there were links with another extremist group, Lashkar-e-Taiba, and, through it, with the Pakistani intelligence services. 
Those detained, however, were depicted as ""foot-soldiers""--bomb-planters deployed by more sinister conspirators. The police believe Mumbai was not the only target; the plan was for co-ordinated attacks in more than one city. On August 30th, a huge stash of explosives was discovered at Delhi's main railway station.
Surprisingly, this evidence of a concerted terrorist onslaught on Indian civilians did not provoke the usual diatribes against the terrorists' supposed sponsors in Pakistan. Instead, Indian officials privately suggested that the slow crawl towards normalised relations--initiated by India's prime minister, Atal Behari Vajpayee, in April--would be allowed to continue, at least for the time being. Pakistan's arrest this week of three army officers with alleged links to terrorist groups may help.
But ""normalisation"" should not be mistaken for a peace process. Mr Vajpayee has ruled out high-level talks while the violence continues. And, supporting Indian boasts about his importance, Ghazi Baba's death unleashed a new wave of violence in Kashmir. More than 30 people died on the first three days of September. Parts of the main highway linking the north and south of the state were blown up.
Against this backdrop, the prospect of talks between separatist groups and the Indian government has faded. Moderate separatists seem to have been eclipsed. A 14-year old insurgency, which poisons relations with Pakistan and brings the scourge of terrorism to television screens and cities, has been resumed in earnest.

THE Babri mosque in Ayodhya in the north-Indian state of Uttar Pradesh is no more, but it still casts a long shadow. It was demolished by a mob of Hindu fanatics in 1992 because they believed it trespassed on the birthplace of the divine king Ram. Ever since, whenever India has been scarred by large-scale communal violence, it has often been traced back to the wound left by that episode, and its unfinished business: the glorious new Ram temple devotees want to build on the site. The issue may also still fuel a power struggle among the leaders of India's ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), and the ""family"" of Hindu-nationalist organisations to which it belongs.
On October 10th, seven of those leaders will be formally charged for their alleged parts in the 1992 riot. They include Murli Manohar Joshi, the minister for human-resource development, and Uma Bharti, the BJP's candidate for chief minister in the important state of Madhya Pradesh, where elections are due to be held in November. But they exclude the man most associated with the mass campaign that culminated in the dismantling of the mosque: L.K. Advani, now India's deputy prime minister.
Mr Advani was also facing charges from the Central Bureau of Investigation. But the CBI's case against him was curiously flawed and, on September 19th, a court in Uttar Pradesh dismissed it. This saved Mr Advani from having to make an embarrassing choice. On the eve of the court's announcement, Mr Joshi had said he would resign his ministerial job if formally charged. This put pressure on Mr Advani to do likewise, or to reveal himself as less of a true follower of the BJP's ""hindutva"" (""Hindu-ness"") ideology than Mr Joshi himself. 
The dropping of charges both saves Mr Advani from this predicament and boosts his presumed ambitions to succeed Atal Behari Vajpayee as India's prime minister. The BJP rules in coalition with a score of smaller parties, many of which would have found it hard to accept a prime minister facing legal action for fomenting communal hatred.
Mr Joshi, however, has not given up playing to the hardline Hindu-nationalist gallery. As a minister, he burnished his HINDUTVA credentials by overseeing the rewriting of school history textbooks to bring them more into line with the ideology's orthodoxy. Now he has carried through his threat to resign against the wishes of the BJP, which maintains the Ayodhya charges are all political. The BJP's spokesman, Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi, insists that Mr Joshi, ""a very disciplined soldier of the party"", will change his mind.
Even if he does, the unbuilt Ram temple will loom large in Indian politics ahead of a general election due before November next year. Mr Naqvi claims it will not be part of the BJP's campaign. But the party's parent, a mass organisation called the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS), or Association of National Volunteers, has other ideas. Its spokesman, Ram Madhav, says that there are only three possible solutions to the temple dispute. Of these, the first--compromise between Hindus and Muslims--seems distant. The second, a court-imposed judicial solution, is equally remote. A dispute over ownership of the temple land has been dragging on for decades. That leaves legislation. The RSS says it will create a climate where campaigning BJP politicians have no option but to take a stand, and back the passage of a law mandating the construction of a temple.
Climate-creation starts in earnest on October 15th, when another RSS offshoot is holding rallies in Delhi and Lucknow, capital of Uttar Pradesh. Mr Madhav expects 1m people to turn up and to move on to Ayodhya for a peaceful demonstration. ""People needn't worry,"" he chuckles. ""There is nothing to demolish.""

IT LOOKED like the festive spirit. On October 22nd, just ahead of the biggest Hindu holiday, Diwali, a time for families and gift-giving, India produced a sackful of goodies for its neighbours and enemies. First came an announcement that the deputy prime minister, L.K. Advani, was willing to talk to separatists in Kashmir. Within hours there followed the unveiling of an offer of 12 practical steps towards improved relations with Pakistan. Both acts of generosity are of course calculated and not as open-hearted as they seem. But they are startling nonetheless, and even hold some promise.
Mr Advani's agreement to talk to the All-Party Hurriyat Conference, an umbrella group of separatist parties in the Indian-controlled part of Kashmir, marks an about-turn. The government had a standing offer of talks, but with its designated ""interlocutor"", N.N. Vohra, a retired civil servant. The Hurriyat insisted on high-level political talks, and the inclusion of Pakistan, which claims Kashmir as its own, in the dialogue.
Last month, however, the Hurriyat split over its approach to negotiations with India. Of its 25 constituents, 13 broke away into a new hard-line group under the leadership of Syed Ali Shah Geelani. Many saw the hand of India's intelligence services in the machinations that led to the fissure. India's offer is directed at the moderate rump of the Hurriyat, chaired by Maulana Abbas Ansari. Mr Geelani at once rebuffed India's offer. Mr Ansari's supporters, however, were at least prepared to discuss it.
India's new approach may be partly inspired by a recent upsurge in violence in Kashmir, now in one of the bloodier phases of its 14-year insurgency. India probably hopes to entrench the divisions in the Hurriyat. Kashmiri politicians give warning that this might be counter-productive, enabling hard-liners to portray the moderates India needs to cultivate as quislings. But India also wants to keep up the pressure on Pakistan, which it accuses of training, arming and encouraging terrorists in Kashmir. It also hopes that America will come to see Pakistan less as a vital ally in its war against al-Qaeda and the Taliban, and more as a state sponsor of anti-Indian terrorism.
Similarly, the offer of improved relations with Pakistan is also intended to impress Indian and foreign opinion that India is not to blame for continued tension between two nuclear powers, which last year seemed at times on the verge of war. The most dramatic proposal is the least likely to be accepted. India has suggested that a bus link be opened across the ""line of control"" that divides the Pakistani and Indian parts of Kashmir. India's prime minister, Atal Behari Vajpayee, earlier this month restated India's claim to the Pakistani part. But India, ultimately, would probably accept the line of control as its international border. Legalising cross-border travel might help formalise that, which is why Pakistan is likely to reject it, popular as it would be in the divided region.
Many of the other ideas promote ""people-to-people contacts"", which have been expanding since April, when Mr Vajpayee launched his latest peace initiative in a speech in Kashmir. Pakistan will welcome most measures, while regretting that India is still not offering to talk about the dispute at the heart of the two countries' long enmity: Kashmir.
Most important to many Indians and Pakistanis, India has offered to renew sporting ties. Cricket, especially, is a cross-border national obsession. India is also suggesting new transport links to add to the over-booked bus service between Delhi and Lahore, including a ferry from Mumbai to Karachi, and the restoration of air links. Aviation talks have in fact already taken place, but Pakistan's demand for an Indian undertaking not to sever links again has created difficulties. Other proposals, for increased diplomatic representation, links between coast guards, and free medical care for 20 sick Pakistani children, seem less contentious.
""The hand of friendship"" Mr Vajpayee extended to Pakistan in April has achieved few concrete results. India says cross-border infiltration in Kashmir continues; certainly the killing goes on. But the gesture proved very popular in India. With important state elections due in December, and a general election next year, Mr Vajpayee may want to milk that popularity for all its vote-pulling power. But effecting a transformation in India's relations with its neighbour has been a recurrent theme of his term in office. He is a statesman and wants to be remembered as such. But unless India agrees to talk about Kashmir, Pakistan will continue to treat Mr Vajpayee as just another Indian politician.

ELECTION fever is almost a permanent condition in India. But an imminent series of state elections is being followed with even more than usual interest across the country. Not only does it cover some big and important states. The results will also provide a pointer to the timing of the general election that has to be held by October next year, as well as to the plans and prospects of the competing parties. 
The first poll, on November 20th, is in the small north-eastern state of Mizoram. But it is the four that follow, on December 1st, that have national significance: in Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh, Chhattisgarh and Delhi (not a full state, but the ""national capital territory""). All are in India's Hindi-speaking heartland, where nearly half of the country's billion people live and where most general elections are decided. 
Moreover, all four states are held by the Congress party, which, at the national level, forms the main opposition to the ruling coalition led by the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP); and in each case, unlike in many states where regional or caste-based parties are important forces, the battle is between Congress and the BJP. So these elections, in one sense, mirror next year's national poll. This is why the independent election commission upheld a complaint against a national advertising campaign by the BJP boasting of India's ""shining"" recent achievements.
The commission has had local difficulties to deal with, too. In Chhattisgarh, the state administration has proved chronically partisan, stooping even to the distribution of school bags decorated with pictures of the chief minister. Similarly, in Madhya Pradesh, the commission ruled against measures by the state government exempting large numbers of people from paying for electricity. 
Despite the perks of being in power, an abiding feature of Indian elections is the ""anti-incumbency"" factor. Almost every Indian government disappoints most voters, and suffers some electoral consequence. In these four states, however, the picture is more complicated. First, the ""incumbency"" burden is shared by Congress, locally, and the BJP at the national level. Second, it may this time be an advantage. An abundant monsoon, bringing relief and modest prosperity to drought-plagued areas, has lifted optimism about India's economic prospects higher than for several years. Government and private forecasters agree that the economy is likely to grow by 7% or more this fiscal year, ending next March.
Such complications may make it hard to judge which party, at the national level, has actually won these elections. The BJP's spokesman, Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi, stalwartly predicts a clear-cut victory for his party in all four. That, however, seems unlikely. In Delhi, opinion polls put Congress far ahead. One Congress leader claims that, fighting the incumbency handicap, three wins out of four would constitute an ""extraordinary"" success.
""The weak link in the chain"", in his words, is Madhya Pradesh. There, the Congress chief minister, Digvijay Singh, has served two five-year terms already. The BJP candidate to replace him is Uma Bharti, a former government minister and a leading light in the campaign that culminated, 11 years ago, in the demolition of a mosque in the town of Ayodhya. That campaign, to build a temple to the Hindu god Ram on the site, was the BJP's springboard to national power. The 1992 riot also led last month to charges being filed against Miss Bharti for her involvement.
But in neither Madhya Pradesh nor elsewhere have Ayodhya and the other ""cultural"" issues that make up the BJP's Hindu-nationalist agenda played a big role in the election campaigns. Last month an attempt by groups linked to the BJP to revive the Ayodhya movement fizzled out. In Madhya Pradesh, it was Mr Singh who raised another ""Hindu"" demand for a national law banning the slaughter of cows, which Hindus regard as holy. ""The desperate tactics of a loser"", snorts Arun Jaitley, the government minister managing the BJP's campaign in the state. 
Victory in Madhya Pradesh would be a great encouragement for Mr Jaitley and Miss Bharti as the BJP prepares for a generational shift from the leadership of Atal Behari Vajpayee, the prime minister, and his deputy, L.K. Advani, both septuagenarians. In Congress, too, successful state chief ministers, such as Mr Singh or Rajasthan's Ashok Gehlot, may emerge as potential national leaders. In that sense, a clean sweep for Congress might not be entirely good news for its leader, the Italian-born Sonia Gandhi.
A BJP landslide, on the other hand--or at least victories in the big states of Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan--would increase pressure on Mr Vajpayee to call an early general election, and not risk having to face the consequences of a failed monsoon next summer. But Mahesh Rangarajan, one of the best-known political analysts in the country, thinks that is unlikely, for three reasons.
The BJP has still to work out what it wants to do in India's biggest state, Uttar Pradesh. Second, Mr Vajpayee wants his place in history as the first non-Congress prime minister to serve a full five-year term. Third, on November 14th, Chandrababu Naidu, the chief minister in another state, Andhra Pradesh, called for an early election, partly to pick up the sympathy vote after he narrowly escaped a terrorist assassination attempt last month. Mr Naidu's Telugu Desam Party is an important ally of the BJP in the central government. Its campaign for a state election that probably cannot be held before next March provides the cautious Mr Vajpayee with yet another reason to wait and see.","In training for the big match next year 
 ELECTION fever is almost a permanent condition in India . But an imminent series of state elections is being followed with even more than usual interest across the country . Not only does it cover some big and important states . The results will also provide a pointer to the timing of the general election that has to be held by October next year , as well as to the plans and prospects of the competing parties . 
 The first poll , on November 20th , is in the small north - eastern state of Mizoram . But it is the four that follow , on December 1st , that have national significance : in Rajasthan , Madhya Pradesh , Chhattisgarh and Delhi ( not a full state , but the "" national capital territory "" ) . All are in India 's Hindi - speaking heartland , where nearly half of the country 's billion people live and where most general elections are decided . 
 Moreover , all four states are held by the Congress party , which , at the national level , forms the main opposition to the ruling coalition led by the Bharatiya Janata Party ( BJP ) ; and in each case , unlike in many states where regional or caste - based parties are important forces , the battle is between Congress and the BJP . So these elections , in one sense , mirror next year 's national poll . This is why the independent election commission upheld a complaint against a national advertising campaign by the BJP boasting of India 's "" shining "" recent achievements . 
 The commission has had local difficulties to deal with , too . In Chhattisgarh , the state administration has proved chronically partisan , stooping even to the distribution of school bags decorated with pictures of the chief minister . Similarly , in Madhya Pradesh , the commission ruled against measures by the state government exempting large numbers of people from paying for electricity . 
 Despite the perks of being in power , an abiding feature of Indian elections is the "" anti - incumbency "" factor . Almost every Indian government disappoints most voters , and suffers some electoral consequence . In these four states , however , the picture is more complicated . First , the "" incumbency "" burden is shared by Congress , locally , and the BJP at the national level . Second , it may this time be an advantage . An abundant monsoon , bringing relief and modest prosperity to drought - plagued areas , has lifted optimism about India 's economic prospects higher than for several years . Government and private forecasters agree that the economy is likely to grow by 7 % or more this fiscal year , ending next March . 
 Such complications may make it hard to judge which party , at the national level , has actually won these elections . The BJP 's spokesman , Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi , stalwartly predicts a clear - cut victory for his party in all four . That , however , seems unlikely . In Delhi , opinion polls put Congress far ahead . One Congress leader claims that , fighting the incumbency handicap , three wins out of four would constitute an "" extraordinary "" success . 
 "" The weak link in the chain "" , in his words , is Madhya Pradesh . There , the Congress chief minister , Digvijay Singh , has served two five - year terms already . The BJP candidate to replace him is Uma Bharti , a former government minister and a leading light in the campaign that culminated , 11 years ago , in the demolition of a mosque in the town of Ayodhya . That campaign , to build a temple to the Hindu god Ram on the site , was the BJP 's springboard to national power . The 1992 riot also led last month to charges being filed against Miss Bharti for her involvement . 
 But in neither Madhya Pradesh nor elsewhere have Ayodhya and the other "" cultural "" issues that make up the BJP 's Hindu - nationalist agenda played a big role in the election campaigns . Last month an attempt by groups linked to the BJP to revive the Ayodhya movement fizzled out . In Madhya Pradesh , it was Mr Singh who raised another "" Hindu "" demand for a national law banning the slaughter of cows , which Hindus regard as holy . "" The desperate tactics of a loser "" , snorts Arun Jaitley , the government minister managing the BJP 's campaign in the state . 
 Victory in Madhya Pradesh would be a great encouragement for Mr Jaitley and Miss Bharti as the BJP prepares for a generational shift from the leadership of Atal Behari Vajpayee , the prime minister , and Atal Bihari Vajpayee's deputy , L.K. Advani , both septuagenarians . In Congress , too , successful state chief ministers , such as Mr Singh or Rajasthan 's Ashok Gehlot , may emerge as potential national leaders . In that sense , a clean sweep for Congress might not be entirely good news for its leader , the Italian - born Sonia Gandhi .

THE guns fell silent on the long border between India and Pakistan at midnight on November 25th-26th, when the two nuclear powers marked the annual Muslim festival of Eid by beginning their first formal ceasefire for at least 20 years. Proposed on November 23rd by Zafarullah Jamali, Pakistan's prime minister, to apply to the line of control that divides the disputed territory of Kashmir, the ceasefire was extended at India's suggestion to cover the full border, including the remote Siachen Glacier in the Karakoram mountains, which has been a freezing battleground since 1984. 
Mr Jamali's initiative took India and most diplomatic observers by surprise. On October 22nd Atal Behari Vajpayee, India's prime minister, had received short shrift from Pakistan when he proposed 12 practical steps for improving relations. Yet just a month later, Mr Jamali was not only announcing a unilateral ceasefire, but also responded positively to several of Mr Vajpayee's October initiatives, including a cross-border bus service in Kashmir, a road route further south, and a restoration of rail and ferry links. 
Mr Jamali's change of heart has been described by some western diplomats as the most positive development for years in relations between two countries that have fought three wars since they became independent in 1947, two of them over Kashmir. The initiative probably stems from a variety of pressures, including international criticism of Pakistan's negative reaction to Mr Vajpayee's proposals. Pakistan has also faced mounting criticism from America, Britain and (more privately) China for providing refuge for al-Qaeda and Taliban activists, including terrorists who infiltrate across Pakistan's border into Indian Kashmir. 
Pakistan is anxious to ensure that Mr Vajpayee confirms his attendance at a regional South Asian conference in Islamabad early in January. It would however be difficult for Mr Vajpayee to attend the summit without holding bilateral talks--at least with Mr Jamali if not with General Pervez Musharraf, Pakistan's president--and India has been insisting that there can be no such talks till Pakistan stops the cross-border infiltration. 
The immediate future of the current initiative--and the ceasefire--therefore primarily depends on the infiltration, which fortuitously always declines at this time of year, when mountain passes are closed by snow. The Indian government has made it clear that, while it has stopped routine shelling of Pakistan military posts, it will fire on any infiltrators that it spots crossing into Kashmir. That could lead to a resumption of hostilities and reduce the chances of the Vajpayee visit taking place. The visit may also depend on progress being made when the two hold talks, on December 1st, on resuming the aviation links currently blocked because of Pakistani reservations. 
India will now come under pressure to suspend its operations against militants in Indian Kashmir, which it last did alongside a temporary ceasefire almost three years ago. For the current initiatives to have much longer-term significance, and gradually develop into a peace process, it will also have to move ahead on talks with Kashmiri separatist groups who want some form of autonomy from Delhi, if not independence. 
On November 21st, the All-Party Hurriyat Conference, an umbrella organisation of moderate Kashmir separatist groups, agreed unconditionally to attend a first-ever formal meeting with L.K. Advani, India's deputy prime minister, that was offered alongside Mr Vajpayee's October 22nd initiative. This meeting is expected to take place early in December--but is already being criticised by a hardline breakaway Hurriyat faction that, significantly, Mr Jamali has recently recognised. The real proof of Pakistan's new interest in peace would be if it let the Hurriyat moderates make progress with the Indian government without fearing retribution from the hardliners. In the past, moderates have met with assassination. It must be different this time.

LIKE his British counterpart, India's prime minister, Atal Behari Vajpayee, has the power to dissolve parliament when he thinks his party might win an election. On December 4th, he might well have been thinking just that. The results of four important state elections held on December 1st were a big boost for his Hindu-nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), which leads India's governing coalition. But they were probably still not a convincing argument for bringing forward the national vote, which must be held by October next year. 
The elections were all in states held by the Congress party, which is the main national opposition. It kept only one: Delhi itself, where the local administration is thanked for having brought a tangible improvement in citizens' lives, through cleaner air, better transport and less sporadic electricity. 
Congress had already failed to win back another state, Mizoram, in the north-east, where elections were held on November 20th, from the former secessionists now in power. There, the swearing-in of the new assembly was delayed by violence on December 4th.
Local issues dominated all the campaigns. Except in a few areas, the BJP did not make much of ""Hindu"" issues, such as the campaign to build a temple to the god Ram in Ayodhya. The ""anti-incumbency"" factor that tends to handicap all ruling parties worked against Congress. In the biggest of the contests, in Madhya Pradesh, the BJP harped on basic infrastructure, still dismal after ten years of Congress rule, and won a landslide. In Rajasthan, where the state government is generally held to have coped well with a five-year drought that only ended with this summer's monsoon, the BJP also won comfortably, as in Chhattisgarh.
The BJP's best-ever performance in these three states in India's Hindi-speaking belt, where most general elections are decided, is a setback for Congress and its Italian-born leader, Sonia Gandhi. It will strengthen those voices in the BJP calling for early elections. National incumbency seems actually to have helped the party. Its spokesmen credit the current strength of India's economy, expected to grow by at least 7% this year. But the mood of national optimism is partly a consequence of the weather--an exceptionally good monsoon. So it could evaporate in a drought before next October.
Unlike Tony Blair, however, Mr Vajpayee cannot pick the date for an election. That is the job of a fiercely independent election commission, which has several months' leeway. That is one reason why Mr Vajpayee may be deterred from an early dissolution of parliament. Another is that he has unfinished business, both in organising his party for the electoral fray, and in securing his own legacy.
An enduring theme of his term in office has been a frustrating attempt to make peace with Pakistan. Twice before it has gone badly wrong, and last year even led to fears of all-out war between the two nuclear powers. His third peace effort is so far going better. This week it was announced that, after a two-year hiatus, the two countries will resume direct air links from January 1st. Further discussions on rail links are now to follow. Also in January, Mr Vajpayee will attend a regional summit in Islamabad, an opportunity for bilateral talks with Pakistan too. A lasting improvement in relations with Pakistan would ensure the patient Mr Vajpayee the place in history he seems to crave. It might also be a vote-winner.","Encouragement for India 's ruling party to call an early general election

""IT SOUNDS like a movie plot,"" says Shekhar Gupta, editor of the Indian Express, a leading daily newspaper. An earnest young engineer reports poor construction work and corruption on a large-scale project to his bosses. Getting nowhere, he writes to the prime minister, who personally instigated the project but takes no notice. His letter leaks and the engineer is assassinated by the contractors' mafia to silence him and teach others a lesson. The government tries to ignore the issue but a campaigning newspaper takes up the cause. The middle class rise up, with 45,000 letters to the newspaper and signatures on an internet petition. This forces the prime minister to act, as government departments try to avoid blame by publicly attacking each other, and more stories emerge about honest officials being killed by the underworld.
Unfortunately, the plot is not fiction. It is being played out in India, where corruption on substandard construction projects is commonplace. Officials are frequently killed or kidnapped by gangs in Bihar, the country's most lawless state. On November 27th, Satyendra Dubey, a 31-year-old engineering graduate working as a project manager on a Bihar section of India's 5,850km (3,650 mile) Golden Quadrilateral highway project, was shot dead.
The $5.5 billion Quadrilateral project was launched in 1998 by Atal Behari Vajpayee, the prime minister, to improve India's ancient potholed road system with four- and six-lane highways linking major cities. Unusually for India, it is more or less on target for completion in a year's time, and officials say it is within budget--despite poor performance by some foreign companies, notably from China and Russia, and inexperienced local contractors.
The Indian Express obtained a copy of a letter that Mr Dubey had written a year earlier to Mr Vajpayee, providing details of the malpractice and asking for his identity to be kept secret. Mr Dubey's list of dodgy practices included international and other large contractors farming out most of their work on the cheap to inexperienced operators and labour gangs, project plans that were understated so that contractors could bill excessive extras, and companies' providing false evidence of their experience--all done, he said, with the co-operation of officials.
The letter was leaked by a government department to people involved on the contracts, and Mr Dubey received threats, which he reported to officials. They merely reprimanded him for writing. Now they are trying to deflect attention by pointing out that it is quite likely that Mr Dubey was killed by one of several contractors whom he had upset by, for example, forcing them to replace faulty work.
Either way, the saga exposes corruption in India's construction industry and the indifference of officials unused to justifying their actions publicly. The government now insists that procedures are being tightened, and Mr Vajpayee says that those responsible for Mr Dubey's death ""will not be spared"". But, as Mr Gupta puts it, the general government view seems to be that he was too honest for his own good.","A tale of corruption and murder

""HISTORY has been made,"" claimed Pervez Musharraf, Pakistan's president, on January 6th, though ""remade"" would have been nearer the truth. At the summit meeting of a group of South Asian nations in Islamabad this week ()see page 49, General Musharraf and India's prime minister, Atal Behari Vajpayee, clasped hands and put two dreadful years of sabre-rattling and terror behind them. The nuclear neighbours have now arrived, more or less, back where they were in 2001, before the failed Agra summit in July of that year and the attack on India's parliament building in Delhi that December drove them to the brink of Armageddon. The task now is to move beyond that point, and towards lasting peace.
It has been a difficult, gradual process, and one for which many actors deserve credit. Mr Vajpayee started things moving, in April last year, with a speech in which he held out ""the hand of friendship"" to Pakistan. That was pretty easy for him. Since India holds the best half of Kashmir, which lies at the heart of the two countries' differences, it can negotiate from a position of strength. Even so, it took a degree of political courage in the run-up to India's state and general elections. Pakistan-bashing, not handshakes, is what usually wins votes in India. General Musharraf deserves praise too, for eventually taking up that offer. Last week's announcement that he may no longer be insisting on a referendum in Kashmir, though arguably only a recognition of reality, helped a lot as well.
The Americans also deserve congratulation. Fearful of seeing a vital front in their war in terror disintegrate--as it would should India and Pakistan once again come to blows--they have twisted arms, the general's in particular, with vigour. For all that he is a key American ally, General Musharraf is also a big worry: an unstable, nuclear-armed (and proliferation-prone, )see page 50 Pakistan is a threat to the entire region, and potentially to America itself. But after the Americans talked tough last autumn, the general stepped up the pressure on extremist groups and sent his army into remote tribal areas to help with the work of flushing out the remnants of the Taliban and al-Qaeda there. In the past few weeks, he has finally persuaded the Indians that he is worth talking to again.
So now diplomatic links between Pakistan and India are fully restored, as are air links, with rail ones to return shortly and a bus service across the ""line of control"" in Kashmir in the offing. The Islamabad summiteers agreed that senior officials will start meeting in February, to discuss all areas of disagreement, Kashmir included. This is still far from the detailed framework for negotiation that the Agra summit was meant to establish, but it is a big step towards it. All the same, the main question remains just what it always has been: can goodwill and talks be turned into a durable peace?
Always Kashmir
It certainly won't be easy. Pakistan and India have been arguing over Kashmir for close to half a century. Two of the three wars the neighbours have fought have been over this scrap of territory. India now holds about half of what was once a princely state, where a Hindu maharajah held sway over his mainly Muslim subjects, and Pakistan most of the rest, though China has nabbed a little too. Kashmir (India's part of it) is not just extraordinarily beautiful, but of strategic importance. India fears that a Pakistani Kashmir, or an independent one that looked towards its fellow Muslim country, would be an impregnable redoubt menacing its rich northern states. More generally, India fears the principle of self-determination. If it were granted to Kashmir, it might reasonably be demanded right across India's multi-ethnic patchwork.
For Pakistan, though, the stakes are hardly any smaller. The quest to liberate the fellow Muslims of Kashmir started with independence in 1947. So many lives have been shed in pursuit of this aim that surrender would be deeply painful. India would be delighted to turn the existing division, which gives it the heart of the state, into a permanent border. But for Pakistan, this would be a humiliating defeat. The very name Pakistan, a modern invention, includes a ""K"" for Kashmir.
Might it not be possible for talks on the issue to drag ponderously on while other aspects of the relationship between these two powerful countries become a little more normal? At present there is virtually no trade across the long India-Pakistan border--though the hope, expressed at the Islamabad meeting, is that this could now start to change, with a South Asian free-trade zone planned for as early as 2006.
In some parts of the world, it has seemed possible to spin a peace process out forever without encountering a bloody breakdown. Cyprus certainly qualifies, with no hostilities to speak of for a quarter-century--but no resolution either. Northern Ireland looks as though it is sliding into the same category. But talks that drag on for years and years also carry their risks. Palestine provides one counter-example: on both sides are zealots who make compromise all but impossible, and who are prepared to resort to violence to pre-empt any risk of it. Sadly, there is reason to think that Kashmir may fall into this category. The lesson of the past two years or so is that relations between India and Pakistan are extraordinarily sensitive to the actions of violent men.
There are two great dangers. One is that Islamic terrorists, nurtured by Pakistan's intelligence service for the long proxy war with India in Kashmir, will refuse to accept that they have outlived their usefulness. It would take only one large bomb directed against a civilian target in the Indian heartland for all the good work of Mr Vajpayee and General Musharraf to be undone. The other danger is even more chilling. By abandoning the Taliban and siding with America in Afghanistan, by taking on militancy at home, and now by moderating his demands on Kashmir, the general has become the prime target of the terrorist groups that infect his country. Two bomb attempts in December revealed a degree of inside knowledge of the general's movements, and only narrowly missed. Stanley Baldwin warned in the 1930s that ""the bomber will always get through"". Should that happen in Pakistan, the dream of peace with India could well be among the casualties.","The news from Islamabad is hugely heartening . But the gains are hugely vulnerable 
 "" HISTORY has been made , "" claimed Pervez Musharraf , Pakistan 's president , on January 6th , though "" remade "" would have been nearer the truth . At the summit meeting of a group of South Asian nations in Islamabad this week ( ) see page 49 , Atal Bihari Vajpayee's , clasped hands and put two dreadful years of sabre - rattling and terror behind Atal Bihari Vajpayee . The nuclear neighbours have now arrived , more or less , back where they were in 2001 , before the failed Agra summit in July of that year and the attack on India 's parliament building in Delhi that December drove them to the brink of Armageddon . The task now is to move beyond that point , and towards lasting peace . 
 It has been a difficult , gradual process , and one for which many actors deserve credit . Mr Vajpayee started things moving , in April last year , with a speech in which he held out "" the hand of friendship "" to Pakistan . That was pretty easy for him . Since India holds the best half of Kashmir , which lies at the heart of the two countries ' differences , it can negotiate from a position of strength . Even so , it took a degree of political courage in the run - up to India 's state and general elections . Pakistan - bashing , not handshakes , is what usually wins votes in India . General Musharraf deserves praise too , for eventually taking up that offer . Last week 's announcement that he may no longer be insisting on a referendum in Kashmir , though arguably only a recognition of reality , helped a lot as well . 
 The Americans also deserve congratulation . Fearful of seeing a vital front in their war in terror disintegrate -- as it would should India and Pakistan once again come to blows -- they have twisted arms , the general 's in particular , with vigour . For all that he is a key American ally , General Musharraf is also a big worry : an unstable , nuclear - armed ( and proliferation - prone , ) see page 50 Pakistan is a threat to the entire region , and potentially to America itself . But after the Americans talked tough last autumn , the general stepped up the pressure on extremist groups and sent his army into remote tribal areas to help with the work of flushing out the remnants of the Taliban and al - Qaeda there . In the past few weeks , he has finally persuaded the Indians that he is worth talking to again . 
 So now diplomatic links between Pakistan and India are fully restored , as are air links , with rail ones to return shortly and a bus service across the "" line of control "" in Kashmir in the offing . The Islamabad summiteers agreed that senior officials will start meeting in February , to discuss all areas of disagreement , Kashmir included . This is still far from the detailed framework for negotiation that the Agra summit was meant to establish , but it is a big step towards it . All the same , the main question remains just what it always has been : can goodwill and talks be turned into a durable peace ? 
 Always Kashmir 
 It certainly wo n't be easy . Pakistan and India have been arguing over Kashmir for close to half a century . Two of the three wars the neighbours have fought have been over this scrap of territory . India now holds about half of what was once a princely state , where a Hindu maharajah held sway over his mainly Muslim subjects , and Pakistan most of the rest , though China has nabbed a little too . Kashmir ( India 's part of it ) is not just extraordinarily beautiful , but of strategic importance . India fears that a Pakistani Kashmir , or an independent one that looked towards its fellow Muslim country , would be an impregnable redoubt menacing its rich northern states . More generally , India fears the principle of self - determination . If it were granted to Kashmir , it might reasonably be demanded right across India 's multi - ethnic patchwork . 
 For Pakistan , though , the stakes are hardly any smaller . The quest to liberate the fellow Muslims of Kashmir started with independence in 1947 . So many lives have been shed in pursuit of this aim that surrender would be deeply painful . India would be delighted to turn the existing division , which gives it the heart of the state , into a permanent border . But for Pakistan , this would be a humiliating defeat . The very name Pakistan , a modern invention , includes a "" K "" for Kashmir . 
 Might it not be possible for talks on the issue to drag ponderously on while other aspects of the relationship between these two powerful countries become a little more normal ? At present there is virtually no trade across the long India - Pakistan border -- though the hope , expressed at the Islamabad meeting , is that this could now start to change , with a South Asian free - trade zone planned for as early as 2006 . 
 In some parts of the world , it has seemed possible to spin a peace process out forever without encountering a bloody breakdown . Cyprus certainly qualifies , with no hostilities to speak of for a quarter - century -- but no resolution either . Northern Ireland looks as though it is sliding into the same category . But talks that drag on for years and years also carry their risks . Palestine provides one counter - example : on both sides are zealots who make compromise all but impossible , and who are prepared to resort to violence to pre - empt any risk of it . Sadly , there is reason to think that Kashmir may fall into this category . The lesson of the past two years or so is that relations between India and Pakistan are extraordinarily sensitive to the actions of violent men . 
 There are two great dangers . One is that Islamic terrorists , nurtured by Pakistan 's intelligence service for the long proxy war with India in Kashmir , will refuse to accept that they have outlived their usefulness . It would take only one large bomb directed against a civilian target in the Indian heartland for all the good work of Mr Vajpayee and General Musharraf to be undone .

THE leaders of India and Pakistan may both have benefited from their joint announcement on January 6th, at a regional conference in Islamabad, that they are to start talking about issues that have divided the two countries for decades. Atal Behari Vajpayee, India's prime minister, has enhanced his reputation as a peacemaker and international statesman. This appears to have bolstered the already strong position of his Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) as it prepares for the general election now expected in India in April. General Pervez Musharraf, Pakistan's president, has shown that, in spite of two assassination attempts in the past four weeks, he is starting to address worries at home and abroad about his country being a base for terrorism. He can also now claim, though many are still sceptical, that he is genuine about making peace with India. 
The agreement to hold a ""composite dialogue""--which is to start next month--goes further than anyone had expected. The joint statement said General Musharraf had reassured Mr Vajpayee that ""he will not permit any territory under Pakistan's control to be used to support terrorism in any manner."" Talks between the two leaders in Agra in July 2001 foundered on Pakistan's refusal to offer precisely that assurance. In exchange, Mr Vajpayee agreed to say that ""the two leaders are confident that the resumption of the composite dialogue will lead to a peaceful settlement of all bilateral issues, including Jammu & Kashmir, to the satisfaction of both sides."" This implies a recognition by India of Pakistan's interest in any solution to the problem of divided Kashmir, a far cry from its past position that Kashmir was an integral part of India, and that Pakistan should have no say in its resolution.
So far, so good. But the road to peace on the subcontinent has seen many such hopes collapse in anguish. 
In 1989, as young prime ministers, Pakistan's Benazir Bhutto and India's Rajiv Gandhi tried to make peace but failed, and the two countries came to the brink of war in 1990. In 1997, Pakistan's Nawaz Sharif and India's Inder Kumar Gujral agreed to a process of dialogue, but relations soured after the BJP came to power in India in 1998 and both countries tested nuclear weapons. In 1999, Mr Sharif and Mr Vajpayee agreed in Lahore to bury the hatchet, but some months later Pakistan--whose army chief at the time was General Musharraf--launched an assault on India in the Kashmir region of Kargil. In 2001, Mr Musharraf and Mr Vajpayee held a doomed summit in Agra, and relations grew much worse the following December when Pakistani-sponsored militants launched a suicide attack on the Indian parliament in Delhi. That attack provoked another near-war, which some feared could have turned nuclear. This strengthened America's determination to push the two countries into a long-term rapprochement.
The new thrust started last April when Mr Vajpayee announced his readiness to normalise relations with Pakistan on the basis of ""trust and sincerity"". General Musharraf responded by saying he was ready for unconditional talks, but India refused while terrorist attacks continued in Kashmir. In November, India offered confidence-building measures, including the restoration of stalled air, rail and sea links, as well as sporting and full diplomatic ties, which Pakistan, after some hesitation, eventually accepted. 
Both sides then began to make conciliatory statements in advance of a seven-country conference of the South Asian Association for Regional Co-operation (SAARC), which provided the occasion for the talks and itself launched anti-terrorism and regional trade initiatives. General Musharraf announced ""unprecedented flexibility"" in Pakistan's historical attitude toward Kashmir by saying that the United Nations resolutions calling for a plebiscite on its future ""could be set aside in the interests of a realistic compromise"". India approvingly noted that Pakistan's ""mindset seemed to have changed"" and acknowledged that fewer militants were entering Kashmir from Pakistan.
The leaders of the two countries now have to decide how to take the Islamabad agreement forward and thwart the efforts of the extremists on both sides who, General Musharraf admitted, would try to derail the peace process. The general is acting from a position of relative strength, despite the two recent assassination attempts. In the past few weeks, he has brokered a deal with Pakistan's parliamentary opposition to amend the constitution and legitimise his seizure of power in 1999. He has also obtained a vote of confidence from parliament, making him, at last, a legitimate president for five years. 
Mr Vajpayee's BJP is expected to decide at an executive-council meeting on January 11th to call for India's general election, due to be held by September, to be brought forward. Mr Vajpayee will want to keep the Islamabad momentum going in the approach to the polls, but without doing anything that might be criticised by anti-Muslim hardliners in his Hindu-nationalist party. He also has to decide how to balance internal reforms in Kashmir alongside talks with Pakistan. 
In the past, Kashmiris have called either for independence or for a takeover by Pakistan. Extremists still make these demands. But most people in the disputed territory now call, more modestly, for Delhi to give the state of Jammu & Kashmir a high degree of autonomy within India.
Though the Indian government has paid lip-service to this idea, it has made no progress. It is happy enough with the status quo, and has seen little point in making concessions in advance of any negotiations with Pakistan. Nor has it had an obvious interlocutor in Kashmir. The state's present government is regarded as representative neither by the extremists nor by activists in the All-Party Hurriyat Conference, an umbrella organisation of Kashmiri separatist groups. Moderate leaders of the Hurriyat are due to meet L.K. Advani, India's deputy prime minister, soon. But they dare not do so without a nod from Pakistan: two of their leading moderates have been murdered in the past 18 months. Perhaps General Musharraf's next move should be to back this Hurriyat meeting, which could open the way to talks involving more of the interested parties.","Atal Bihari Vajpayee's have turned away from confrontation .

IN THE middle of 2002 Atal Behari Vajpayee, India's prime minister, looked as though he might hobble off the world stage on ailing knees, taking his creaking body into political retirement. Time magazine ran a big story on how this ""ordinary old man"" was spending ""the twilight of his political life where he wants to be--out to lunch"". Nearly two years later, Mr Vajpayee still walks hesitantly on reconstructed knees, often speaks disconcertingly slowly, and enjoys his lunch more than he perhaps should at 79. But he is increasingly recognised as one of the world's most surprising statesmen. Now he is pushing his Bharatiya Janata Party's (BJP) multi-party coalition into an early general election, confident of a victory that few analysts are yet prepared to question. 
In the past fortnight Mr Vajpayee has pulled off a reconciliation with President Pervez Musharraf of Pakistan, setting the two countries on the most promising, if uncertain, path to peace for years. He persuaded President George Bush to announce, on January 12th, a long-awaited co-operation agreement in high technology, space and nuclear products, which will beef up India-American relations. He got Jaswant Singh, his finance minister, to produce not one but two generous pre-election mini-budgets on January 8th and 9th. And L.K. Advani, his deputy prime minister, is to back up planned talks between India and Pakistan by meeting leaders from Kashmir's separatist All-Party Hurriyat Conference on January 22nd for their first-ever formal talks on devolution.
Mr Vajpayee also seems energised by the prospect of the election campaign. At a recent political rally he spoke with the sort of force and clarity that once made him famous as an orator, and said he hoped a new government would be in place by the end of April. 
The prime minister's 2002 low point came when more than 2,000 people were killed in Hindu-Muslim riots in Gujarat. Afterwards, the state's controversial chief minister, Narendra Modi, won a landslide assembly victory for the BJP on an anti-Muslim ticket. That strengthened hardliners within the Sangh Parivar, the Hindu ""family of organisations"" to which the BJP belongs, and led to fears of similarly provocative election campaigning elsewhere. But, following a defeat in a small northern state, Mr Vajpayee tacked to a more moderate line, with campaigns stressing development and stable government. He was rewarded in December with election victories in three key states. 
Mr Vajpayee now seems unlikely to retire before his health compels him to, and certainly not, as was mooted a year or so ago, soon after the coming election. ""If he works at 79, he can work at 84,"" says Pramod Mahajan, a prominent BJP politician. That seems to be accepted by the 76-year-old Mr Advani, who has long been a rival as well as an ally, and whose prospects of becoming prime minister fade the longer Mr Vajpayee remains. Mr Advani is seen as a nationalist hardliner. He cannot mount a challenge now because he knows that he would find it difficult to hold the BJP's National Democratic Alliance coalition together, let alone win an election, if Mr Vajpayee were to depart.
The BJP's election confidence stems partly from disarray in Congress, the main opposition party, which is ineptly led by the Italian-born Sonia Gandhi, widow of Rajiv Gandhi, the former prime minister assassinated in 1991. The BJP plans to campaign on a strong economy (with growth of over 7% last year), stable government and now the prospect of peace with Pakistan. It adds up to a hard act to beat.

 IN THE middle of 2002 Atal Bihari Vajpayee's , looked as though Atal Bihari Vajpayee might hobble off the world stage on ailing knees , taking Atal Bihari Vajpayee's creaking body into political retirement . Time magazine ran a big story on how Atal Bihari Vajpayee was spending "" the twilight of Atal Bihari Vajpayee's political life where Atal Bihari Vajpayee wants to be -- out to lunch "" . Nearly two years later , Atal Bihari Vajpayee still walks hesitantly on reconstructed knees , often speaks disconcertingly slowly , and enjoys Atal Bihari Vajpayee's lunch more than Atal Bihari Vajpayee perhaps should at 79 . But Atal Bihari Vajpayee is increasingly recognised as one of the world 's most surprising statesmen . Now Atal Bihari Vajpayee is pushing Atal Bihari Vajpayee's Bharatiya Janata Party 's ( BJP ) multi - party coalition into an early general election , confident of a victory that few analysts are yet prepared to question . 
 In the past fortnight Atal Bihari Vajpayee has pulled off a reconciliation with President Pervez Musharraf of Pakistan , setting the two countries on the most promising , if uncertain , path to peace for years . Atal Bihari Vajpayee persuaded President George Bush to announce , on January 12th , a long - awaited co - operation agreement in high technology , space and nuclear products , which will beef up India - American relations . Atal Bihari Vajpayee got Jaswant Singh , Atal Bihari Vajpayee's finance minister , to produce not one but two generous pre - election mini - budgets on January 8th and 9th . And L.K. Advani , Atal Bihari Vajpayee's deputy prime minister , is to back up planned talks between India and Pakistan by meeting leaders from Kashmir 's separatist All - Party Hurriyat Conference on January 22nd for their first - ever formal talks on devolution . 
 Atal Bihari Vajpayee also seems energised by the prospect of the election campaign . At a recent political rally Atal Bihari Vajpayee spoke with the sort of force and clarity that once made Atal Bihari Vajpayee famous as an orator , and said Atal Bihari Vajpayee hoped a new government would be in place by the end of April . 
 Atal Bihari Vajpayee's 2002 low point came when more than 2,000 people were killed in Hindu - Muslim riots in Gujarat . Afterwards , the state 's controversial chief minister , Narendra Modi , won a landslide assembly victory for the BJP on an anti - Muslim ticket . That strengthened hardliners within the Sangh Parivar , the Hindu "" family of organisations "" to which the BJP belongs , and led to fears of similarly provocative election campaigning elsewhere . But , following a defeat in a small northern state , Atal Bihari Vajpayee tacked to a more moderate line , with campaigns stressing development and stable government . Atal Bihari Vajpayee was rewarded in December with election victories in three key states . 
 Atal Bihari Vajpayee now seems unlikely to retire before Atal Bihari Vajpayee's health compels Atal Bihari Vajpayee to , and certainly not , as was mooted a year or so ago , soon after the coming election . "" If Atal Bihari Vajpayee works at 79 , Atal Bihari Vajpayee can work at 84 , "" says Pramod Mahajan , a prominent BJP politician . That seems to be accepted by the 76 - year - old Mr Advani , who has long been a rival as well as an ally , and whose prospects of becoming prime minister fade the longer Atal Bihari Vajpayee remains . Mr Advani is seen as a nationalist hardliner . He can not mount a challenge now because he knows that he would find it difficult to hold the BJP 's National Democratic Alliance coalition together , let alone win an election , if Atal Bihari Vajpayee were to depart . 
 The BJP 's election confidence stems partly from disarray in Congress , the main opposition party , which is ineptly led by the Italian - born Sonia Gandhi , widow of Rajiv Gandhi , the former prime minister assassinated in 1991 . The BJP plans to campaign on a strong economy ( with growth of over 7 % last year ) , stable government and now the prospect of peace with Pakistan . It adds up to a hard act to beat .

IT IS all a question of branding. Is Sonia Gandhi, the Italian-born president of Congress, India's main opposition party, marketable as the heiress of the Nehru-Gandhi dynasty, or will her foreign origins turn off India's 650m voters? India's forthcoming general election, now expected in April, will see Mrs Gandhi, an inexperienced politician, competing against Atal Behari Vajpayee, the politically savvy prime minister. His Bharatiya Janata Party certainly intends to make Mrs Gandhi's origins an issue in the election.
Mrs Gandhi is a reluctant recruit to politics, as was her husband Rajiv, assassinated in 1991. But Rajiv Gandhi was the grandson of Jawaharlal Nehru, India's first prime minister, and the son of Indira Gandhi, the prime minister murdered in 1984. He had no difficulty leading Congress to victory after his mother's death. Whether his widow can turn the thousands who come to see her into votes is still uncertain. 
Since she became politically active as Congress president in 1998, Sonia Gandhi has failed to emerge as an effective leader. She has been shielded from public exposure by a coterie of advisers and sycophantic hangers-on. Believing that she might not survive politically in the public glare, party officials hoped that Congress would inherit power by default when Mr Vajpayee's coalition collapsed. But the coalition has not collapsed, and Congress fared poorly in recent local elections.
There has been ""ineffectual communication of what she stands for, so she has been robbed of any equity brand or identity,"" says Suhel Seth of Equus, a Delhi-based branding company, who advises politicians. More simply, ""She is seen as an Italian pretending to be an Indian politician."" It is not even clear whether she expects to become prime minister. Her official line is that this will be decided after the polls. The party's politicians, however, insist they expect her to have the job if Congress wins over 180 seats in parliament--it took 112 out of 545 in the last election, in 1999--and secures enough coalition allies. 
Politicians close to Mrs Gandhi say she has little-known virtues. Kapil Sibal, a Congress spokesman, says she would be ""a more honest, secular and forthright prime minister than Vajpayee."" Ashwani Kumar, a lawyer who runs a party think-tank, says that family members ""are relevant because they are the symbol of sacrifice and continuity in the history of Congress and modern India."" But his argument is unlikely to mean much to India's emerging young middle class.
The line does not end with Mrs Gandhi. Her son and daughter, Rahul and Priyanka, so far not active in politics, have just visited two family-linked constituencies in Uttar Pradesh. Priyanka Gandhi is expected to become a parliamentary candidate there, and her brother may also stand, perhaps in Tamil Nadu in the south. The party believes this would help, especially if Mrs Gandhi becomes more approachable. She has embarked on a rural tour and broken with tradition by visiting potential allies to ask them to join a coalition, instead of waiting for supplicants. But time is short for image-transformation--especially when the marketability of the basic brand is in doubt.

AFTER nearly 60 years of bitter dispute between India and Pakistan over the sovereignty of Kashmir, and 14 years of bloody insurgency in the Indian-administered part of the territory, no one expects a swift resolution. But at least, says Amitabh Mattoo, an Indian expert on the region, ""for the first time in years you can see light at the end of the tunnel."" Two sets of talks--between India and Pakistan, and between the Indian government and moderate Kashmiri separatists--offer negotiation a chance, however slim, of succeeding where violence has failed.
This week India and Pakistan set dates, February 16th-18th, for a first round of promised talks between senior diplomats on all bilateral issues, including Kashmir. Indian officials, meanwhile, were congratulating themselves that a ground-breaking meeting on January 22nd between L.K. Advani, the deputy prime minister, and a group of Kashmiri separatist leaders, had gone better than most had expected. The five-member delegation from the All-Party Hurriyat Conference was rewarded with an audience with the prime minister, Atal Behari Vajpayee. The delegation, according to Umar Farooq, one of its members, found him ""serious and sincere about finding the way out."" 
Little concrete came out of the discussion. The two sides agreed to meet again, in late March; to pursue a ""step-by-step approach"" through dialogue; and India promised to ""examine"" the cases of the hundreds of people detained in Kashmir as suspected militants. But after talking only indirectly or clandestinely, if at all, for so long, this represents progress, even if the shape of an acceptable final compromise remains hard to discern. It looks like the start of something that has not existed until now: a peace process.
But will that process endure? The danger is that the dialogue itself could disqualify the Kashmiri participants as representatives of those struggling for freedom from India. Mr Farooq, the mirwaiz, a hereditary post making him the Kashmir valley's senior Muslim cleric, and the other members of the delegation do have a popular following. But as Mr Mattoo, who is vice-chancellor of the University of Jammu in Indian Kashmir, puts it, ""these are not towering leaders who can carry the population with them.""
They will need to show that the talks are yielding real benefits--such as the release of detainees and a less intrusive and abusive Indian security presence--if they are not to be seen as selling out. Mr Farooq hopes that India is poised to announce a ceasefire towards militants, though Mr Advani has played down that possibility. Mr Farooq would also like India to let the Hurriyat travel to Pakistan to meet leaders there, thereby completing the third side of a ""triangular"" dialogue, and visit the militants running camps in Pakistan-administered Kashmir in order to appeal for a reciprocal truce.
A complete end to violence seems a very ambitious hope. More pressing is the need to protect the limited progress made already from the many onslaughts it could face: the tirades of those pro-Pakistan and pro-independence Kashmiris who have denounced the dialogue; terrorist attacks designed to provoke a violent Indian response and thwart any softening of its army's behaviour; perhaps even the assassination of moderate Hurriyat leaders, which was the sad fate of the father of Bilal Lone, one member of the Kashmiri delegation, in 2002. The previous mirwaiz, too, was murdered in 1990, which may have helped shape his son's view that ""there is no other way"" than dialogue.","At last , what looks like a process

IN THE middle of Srinagar, the main city of the Kashmir Valley, the streets still bustle. The placid waters of the Dal Lake, the city's glory, are plied by lonely tourist-hunting boatmen under a winter sun glinting off snow-streaked mountain peaks. But the shoreline is patrolled by rifle-toting Indian soldiers. Armoured vehicles police the markets, and moderate separatist leaders go surrounded by security guards for fear of assassination. 
""Militancy"", the local euphemism for explosions and other acts of terrorism, persists, as does Indian counter-insurgency. In recent weeks, India's forces have managed to kill several prominent militant leaders. On February 6th, in a traditionally pro-Pakistan area of Srinagar, a demand that police release the body of one leader, Rafiq Dar, turned into a near-riot. A mob pelted the cars of separatist leaders with stones, in protest at their ineffectiveness in resisting India. Three days later, 15,000 people demonstrated against the killing of five civilians in an army operation. 
Among the resisters, who have been struggling bloodily for 15 years, the mood is bitter. ""Everybody knows India has won,"" says one. ""It has used violence to tire people out. Now, there will be no dignified way out."" Others may be less candid, but many share the anger and humiliation. 
Yet this is supposed to be a moment of unprecedented hope in Kashmir's long agony. At a meeting in Islamabad last month, Atal Behari Vajpayee, India's prime minister, and Pervez Musharraf, Pakistan's president and army chief, edged away from long-entrenched positions. India accepted that Kashmir was a ""bilateral issue"" that could be discussed with Pakistan, and needed settlement. For his part, General Musharraf promised to lend no support to terrorism. This was taken as a pledge to stop financing, training and arming the militant infiltrators India blames for fomenting and waging the uprising in Kashmir. Next week, from February 16th-18th, senior diplomats from the two countries will meet, again in Islamabad, to start mapping out plans for a ""composite dialogue"" that will include Kashmir.
Last month saw another hint of a thaw. Mr Vajpayee's deputy, Lal Krishna Advani, held talks in Delhi with a group representing factions of the All-Party Hurriyat Conference, an umbrella for various Kashmiri separatist groups. The delegation visited Mr Vajpayee, too, and declared him serious about achieving peace. 
That so many in Kashmir discount the prospects for peace stems, in part, from the fact that Kashmiris will take no part in next week's talks. But they also say they have seen no improvement in their daily lives. This is not entirely fair. Along the ""line of control"" that divides Indian- from Pakistani-administered Kashmir, a ceasefire declared by Pakistan last November and reciprocated by India has ended the ritual cross-border shooting and shelling. In Srinagar, these days, soldiers spend more time in their bunkers and less frisking passers-by.
A ""healing touch"" was the promise held out to Kashmiris by the new state government that took power after the elections of November 2002. The ballot had been boycotted, as usual, by the Hurriyat, and few people in the Valley voted, but it was generally seen as free and fair. The winning coalition, led by the People's Democratic Party (PDP), freed some detainees, including a few leading separatists, and a much-hated Special Operations Group (SOG) of the Indian police was merged with regular forces.
But Pervez Imroz, a human-rights lawyer in Srinagar, sees no difference between the present government and its predecessors in their inability to hold the security forces to account. Harassment of civilians continues in the countryside. The SOG may have been disbanded in name, but it continues to operate. Many Kashmiris believe that killings in ""encounters"" with the army or police, such as that of Mr Dar, are in fact deaths after torture in custody. 
Disappearances continue, and are blamed on the security forces. The state government suggests that 3,931 people have disappeared since the uprising began. The police deny this, claiming that most of those who have vanished fled of their own accord, some to join militant groups. Mr Imroz believes the true number of the disappeared is around 8,000. Militants, too, abuse human rights, and in some places are more feared than the Indian army. They have a grisly record of mistreating civilians and of killing their own comrades when they show signs of moderation. 
Kashmiris are weary of war, but scepticism about recent ""breakthroughs"" is understandable. It has deep roots in history, in the divisions among Kashmiris themselves, and in the strong arguments against every ""solution"" proposed so far. 
The wavering maharajah
Almost every interview with a Kashmiri politician starts with a history lesson, dating from the partition of India in 1947. India's ""princely states"", which had retained notional independence, were given the option of acceding to India or to Pakistan. One such was Jammu & Kashmir, which had a Muslim majority but a Hindu maharajah. He vacillated, until his hand was forced by a tribal rebellion in part of his kingdom, backed by Pakistani tribesmen and regular soldiers. To secure military help, he acceded to India in October 1947, and the first of three India-Pakistan wars started. India appealed to the United Nations Security Council, which in January 1948 passed the first of its 18 resolutions on Kashmir.
Later that year, the UN called for a plebiscite to ask Kashmiris to choose between India and Pakistan, once Pakistan's forces had withdrawn. Pakistan still demands that the vote be held. But the first war ended in July 1949 with Kashmir divided, as it still is. India, viewing Pakistan as illegally occupying part of its territory, argues that a plebiscite is irrelevant.
The war left India in control of about 45% of the old kingdom's land area. The Indian state of Jammu & Kashmir now incorporates three parts: Ladakh, divided between Buddhists and Muslims; Jammu, with a Hindu majority; and the 130km (80 mile) -long, 55km-wide Kashmir Valley, which has a Muslim majority and more than half the state's population of 10m. Some 3m Kashmiris live under Pakistani rule in ""Azad"" (""free"") Kashmir and the Northern Areas. To complicate things further, some 20% of largely uninhabited historic Kashmir is under Chinese control. 
Under ""temporary provisions"" enshrined in Article 370 of India's constitution, the state of Jammu & Kashmir was promised considerable autonomy. But this has never materialised. After an egregiously rigged state election in 1987, some Kashmiris took up arms. Some of their compatriots from Pakistan-controlled Kashmir began to join their struggle. So too, through the 1990s, did increasing numbers of Pakistanis, Afghans, Chechens and others, seeing in Kashmir a jihad like that in the 1980s against the Soviet occupation of Afghanistan. 
Pakistan's army and intelligence services have helped run the war. The firing over the line of control was seen by India as a device to provide cover for infiltrators. In the winter months, when the high mountain passes into the Kashmir Valley are snowbound, infiltration tails off anyway. This year, says India, it has halted almost altogether. India is waiting to see if the summer brings an expected rise in ""exfiltration"", in implicit fulfilment of General Musharraf's promise.
By Indian estimates, some 40,000 people have died in the war. Leading members of the Hurriyat say 100,000. Even last year, when relations were improving, more than 3,000 people were killed. The Indian army says they included 818 civilians and 1,345 ""terrorists"", 935 of them foreigners. Some 500,000 Indian soldiers, paramilitaries and police are stationed in the territory, fighting an estimated 2,000-3,000 militants. At times the conflict threatens to widen. In 1999, Pakistani incursions in the Kargil area, planned by General Musharraf before he seized power in a coup, led to fighting in which at least 1,000 soldiers died. In 2002, after India blamed Pakistan-backed terrorists for attacks the year before on the assembly in Srinagar and the parliament in Delhi, hundreds of thousands of troops massed on the line of control and the international border. Full-scale--even nuclear--war seemed possible.
As Pakistan sees it
Some proposals for stopping the slaughter date back half a century. Pakistan still demands a plebiscite. It has two fundamental reasons for clinging to its claim. It was founded as the homeland for India's Muslims, and feels incomplete without its neighbouring Muslim-majority state. Kashmir was the ""K"" in the acronym that made up the name Pakistan, which also means ""land of the pure"". Without Kashmir, ""Pakistan"" is literally meaningless. Second, Pakistan's army has long hankered after the ""strategic depth"" Kashmir would give it. It will never feel utterly safe without it. There is a third reason for fuelling the war, however: at a low cost to Pakistan, it keeps half of India's army tied up.
Syed Ali Shah Geelani, the leader in Indian Kashmir of a breakaway, pro-Pakistan faction of the Hurriyat, sees Kashmiris as victims of a global conspiracy against Muslims, cheated of their rightful incorporation into Pakistan. The talks his former Hurriyat colleagues have opened with Delhi are ""meaningless, unnecessary and futile"". Similarly, the India-Pakistan dialogue on Kashmir is doomed to ""utter failure"". ""We are not warmongers, not interested in bloodshed,"" he says, ""but India ignored us for 50 years."" If the insurgency lasts another 30 years, ""it doesn't matter"".
India's official position mirrors Pakistan's: it, too, claims the entirety of the old kingdom. But India has long let it be known that it is ready to discuss the permanent division of the state along the old 1949 ceasefire line--roughly the present line of control, on part of which it is now erecting a fence equipped with high-technology sensors. India also has deep-seated objections to ceding Kashmir. As a secular union, it needs its sole Muslim-majority state, and fears that if Kashmir is granted independence or joins Pakistan, other states may want to leave the union as well. 
Many Kashmiris would favour neither Pakistan nor India, but independence. Even short of that, they are outraged that India and Pakistan could contemplate discussing their future with no Kashmiris there. Yasin Malik, leader of the Jammu & Kashmir Liberation Front, a secular nationalist group, is running a signature campaign to demand Kashmiri participation in the talks. ""This is not a bilateral issue; not a border dispute,"" he says, ""It is related to the people of Kashmir."" He claims to have nearly 1m signatures already, and hopes to secure 2m.
But how many seats at the table? And filled by whom? Sajjad Lone of the People's Conference, a moderate Hurriyat member, says that, in the search for a solution, ""Kashmiris have been reduced to an ornamental role, because India and Pakistan have made up, and because of the inherent fragmentation of the Kashmiri leadership."" The Hurriyat itself is split. Then there is the PDP government elected in 2002, and the other parties that won votes. Umar Farooq, part of the Hurriyat's delegation to Delhi, concedes that these elected politicians too have constituencies to consider. Then there are the Buddhists of Ladakh and the Hindus of Jammu, who would probably prefer complete incorporation into India. There is also the Hindu minority in the Valley itself, the pandits, most of whom--60,000 families by some estimates--have fled the Valley for fear of anti-Hindu pogroms.
Were Kashmir discussed at such an expanded table, every solution would be unacceptable to somebody. Hurriyat leaders such as Mr Farooq rule out ""trifurcation"" of the Indian state into its three component parts--in effect, a division along religious lines. Similarly, they would reject the ""Chenab"" formula, under which the state would be repartitioned along the bed of the Chenab river, which would leave most Kashmiri Muslims in Pakistan. India, rejecting a plebiscite, would be no more amenable to one in which people were asked about the future not of the whole state, but of their own district or sub-district. Nor does it seem ready to contemplate imaginative proposals devised by the America-based Kashmir Study Group. These envisage the reconstitution of part of Kashmir as a ""sovereign entity without an international personality""--ie, just short of full independence. 
Flickers of light
There is no public sign that India is prepared to accept anything other than a solution based on the status quo. And as General Musharraf put it last year, in remarks much quoted in Srinagar: ""The line of control is why we have had three wars. That is the dispute. It can never be the solution.""
So is all the talk of breakthroughs and settlements so much hot air--part of Mr Vajpayee's campaign for victory in elections to be held this spring, and General Musharraf's bid for international respectability? Not quite. Both leaders seem sincere in seeking a peace that is clearly, after all, in both countries' interests. Mr Vajpayee has taken bold political gambles to pursue peace even when unremitting hostility has appeared the safer electoral option. General Musharraf is struggling to prove he is part of America's answer to the scourge of terrorism and not part of the problem. The revelation of Pakistan's involvement in the sale of nuclear secrets to Libya, Iran and North Korea makes it even more imperative to show evidence of good behaviour elsewhere. The general's narrow escapes from two assassination attempts late last year--blamed on extremist Islamists--also highlighted the dangers of pandering to Pakistan's jihadi groups.
In both countries, says Pran Chopra, a veteran Indian journalist and commentator, ""the circle of sanity is widening."" But neither has done much to prepare public opinion for a climbdown. General Musharraf has said that both sides must shift a bit, and has hinted at dropping Pakistan's insistence on a plebiscite. But each country expects concessions from the other. General Musharraf has to contend with elements of his own army and intelligence services and their jihadi clients, who see Pakistan as incomplete without Kashmir. 
Mr Vajpayee heads a Hindu nationalist party, one of whose platforms has long been the revocation of Kashmir's special status under Article 370. The army in India has never had the clout of its Pakistani counterpart, but it too would find it hard to accept concessions after losing so many lives. An opinion poll in Tehelka, a new weekly newspaper, suggests that 87% of soldiers see the Kashmir problem as one of terrorism, not a freedom struggle.
Even if Indians and Pakistanis could be convinced that peace in Kashmir is worth a few concessions, there remains the difficulty of selling a settlement to disaffected Kashmiris. The Hurriyat's Umar Farooq says India must soon adopt measures to persuade them that this is a serious peace effort. A huge step forward would be the promised opening of a bus route across the line of control, between Srinagar and Muzaffarabad. It raises tricky issues, notably over travel documents, but holds out the promise of a gradual ""softening"" of the border, allowing Kashmiris to travel, mingle and trade. People-to-people contacts would slowly lessen the importance of political symbols, and India would grant Kashmir greater autonomy. Eventually, India hopes, politicians such as Umar Farooq, the hereditary spiritual leader of the Valley's Sunni Muslims, might be enticed into mainstream Indian politics.
If it works out that way, it would indeed look like an Indian ""victory"". The difficulty will be to avoid making that look like a Pakistani and Kashmiri defeat.
Caption: For Pakistan, India, or neither, but wanting to be heard","As India and Pakistan begin talks on improving relations , the people of disputed Kashmir are torn between hope , anger and despair 
 IN THE middle of Srinagar , the main city of the Kashmir Valley , the streets still bustle . The placid waters of the Dal Lake , the city 's glory , are plied by lonely tourist - hunting boatmen under a winter sun glinting off snow - streaked mountain peaks . But the shoreline is patrolled by rifle - toting Indian soldiers . Armoured vehicles police the markets , and moderate separatist leaders go surrounded by security guards for fear of assassination . 
 "" Militancy "" , the local euphemism for explosions and other acts of terrorism , persists , as does Indian counter - insurgency . In recent weeks , India 's forces have managed to kill several prominent militant leaders . On February 6th , in a traditionally pro - Pakistan area of Srinagar , a demand that police release the body of one leader , Rafiq Dar , turned into a near - riot . A mob pelted the cars of separatist leaders with stones , in protest at their ineffectiveness in resisting India . Three days later , 15,000 people demonstrated against the killing of five civilians in an army operation . 
 Among the resisters , who have been struggling bloodily for 15 years , the mood is bitter . "" Everybody knows India has won , "" says one . "" It has used violence to tire people out . Now , there will be no dignified way out . "" Others may be less candid , but many share the anger and humiliation . 
 Yet this is supposed to be a moment of unprecedented hope in Kashmir 's long agony . At a meeting in Islamabad last month , Atal Bihari Vajpayee's , and Pervez Musharraf , Pakistan 's president and army chief , edged away from long - entrenched positions . India accepted that Kashmir was a "" bilateral issue "" that could be discussed with Pakistan , and needed settlement . For his part , General Musharraf promised to lend no support to terrorism . This was taken as a pledge to stop financing , training and arming the militant infiltrators India blames for fomenting and waging the uprising in Kashmir . Next week , from February 16th-18th , senior diplomats from the two countries will meet , again in Islamabad , to start mapping out plans for a "" composite dialogue "" that will include Kashmir . 
 Last month saw another hint of a thaw . Atal Bihari Vajpayee's deputy , Lal Krishna Advani , held talks in Delhi with a group representing factions of the All - Party Hurriyat Conference , an umbrella for various Kashmiri separatist groups . The delegation visited Atal Bihari Vajpayee , too , and declared Atal Bihari Vajpayee serious about achieving peace . 
 That so many in Kashmir discount the prospects for peace stems , in part , from the fact that Kashmiris will take no part in next week 's talks . But they also say they have seen no improvement in their daily lives . This is not entirely fair . Along the "" line of control "" that divides Indian- from Pakistani - administered Kashmir , a ceasefire declared by Pakistan last November and reciprocated by India has ended the ritual cross - border shooting and shelling . In Srinagar , these days , soldiers spend more time in their bunkers and less frisking passers - by . 
 A "" healing touch "" was the promise held out to Kashmiris by the new state government that took power after the elections of November 2002 . The ballot had been boycotted , as usual , by the Hurriyat , and few people in the Valley voted , but it was generally seen as free and fair . The winning coalition , led by the People 's Democratic Party ( PDP ) , freed some detainees , including a few leading separatists , and a much - hated Special Operations Group ( SOG ) of the Indian police was merged with regular forces . 
 But Pervez Imroz , a human - rights lawyer in Srinagar , sees no difference between the present government and its predecessors in their inability to hold the security forces to account . Harassment of civilians continues in the countryside . The SOG may have been disbanded in name , but it continues to operate . Many Kashmiris believe that killings in "" encounters "" with the army or police , such as that of Mr Dar , are in fact deaths after torture in custody . 
 Disappearances continue , and are blamed on the security forces . The state government suggests that 3,931 people have disappeared since the uprising began . The police deny this , claiming that most of those who have vanished fled of their own accord , some to join militant groups . Mr Imroz believes the true number of the disappeared is around 8,000 . Militants , too , abuse human rights , and in some places are more feared than the Indian army . They have a grisly record of mistreating civilians and of killing their own comrades when they show signs of moderation . 
 Kashmiris are weary of war , but scepticism about recent "" breakthroughs "" is understandable . It has deep roots in history , in the divisions among Kashmiris themselves , and in the strong arguments against every "" solution "" proposed so far . 
 The wavering maharajah 
 Almost every interview with a Kashmiri politician starts with a history lesson , dating from the partition of India in 1947 . India 's "" princely states "" , which had retained notional independence , were given the option of acceding to India or to Pakistan . One such was Jammu & Kashmir , which had a Muslim majority but a Hindu maharajah . He vacillated , until his hand was forced by a tribal rebellion in part of his kingdom , backed by Pakistani tribesmen and regular soldiers . To secure military help , he acceded to India in October 1947 , and the first of three India - Pakistan wars started . India appealed to the United Nations Security Council , which in January 1948 passed the first of its 18 resolutions on Kashmir . 
 Later that year , the UN called for a plebiscite to ask Kashmiris to choose between India and Pakistan , once Pakistan 's forces had withdrawn . Pakistan still demands that the vote be held . But the first war ended in July 1949 with Kashmir divided , as it still is . India , viewing Pakistan as illegally occupying part of its territory , argues that a plebiscite is irrelevant . 
 The war left India in control of about 45 % of the old kingdom 's land area . The Indian state of Jammu & Kashmir now incorporates three parts : Ladakh , divided between Buddhists and Muslims ; Jammu , with a Hindu majority ; and the 130 km ( 80 mile ) -long , 55km - wide Kashmir Valley , which has a Muslim majority and more than half the state 's population of 10 m. Some 3 m Kashmiris live under Pakistani rule in "" Azad "" ( "" free "" ) Kashmir and the Northern Areas . To complicate things further , some 20 % of largely uninhabited historic Kashmir is under Chinese control . 
 Under "" temporary provisions "" enshrined in Article 370 of India 's constitution , the state of Jammu & Kashmir was promised considerable autonomy . But this has never materialised . After an egregiously rigged state election in 1987 , some Kashmiris took up arms . Some of their compatriots from Pakistan - controlled Kashmir began to join their struggle . So too , through the 1990s , did increasing numbers of Pakistanis , Afghans , Chechens and others , seeing in Kashmir a jihad like that in the 1980s against the Soviet occupation of Afghanistan . 
 Pakistan 's army and intelligence services have helped run the war . The firing over the line of control was seen by India as a device to provide cover for infiltrators . In the winter months , when the high mountain passes into the Kashmir Valley are snowbound , infiltration tails off anyway . This year , says India , it has halted almost altogether . India is waiting to see if the summer brings an expected rise in "" exfiltration "" , in implicit fulfilment of General Musharraf 's promise . 
 By Indian estimates , some 40,000 people have died in the war . Leading members of the Hurriyat say 100,000 . Even last year , when relations were improving , more than 3,000 people were killed . The Indian army says they included 818 civilians and 1,345 "" terrorists "" , 935 of them foreigners . Some 500,000 Indian soldiers , paramilitaries and police are stationed in the territory , fighting an estimated 2,000 - 3,000 militants . At times the conflict threatens to widen . In 1999 , Pakistani incursions in the Kargil area , planned by General Musharraf before he seized power in a coup , led to fighting in which at least 1,000 soldiers died . In 2002 , after India blamed Pakistan - backed terrorists for attacks the year before on the assembly in Srinagar and the parliament in Delhi , hundreds of thousands of troops massed on the line of control and the international border . Full - scale -- even nuclear -- war seemed possible . 
 As Pakistan sees it 
 Some proposals for stopping the slaughter date back half a century . Pakistan still demands a plebiscite . It has two fundamental reasons for clinging to its claim . It was founded as the homeland for India 's Muslims , and feels incomplete without its neighbouring Muslim - majority state . Kashmir was the "" K "" in the acronym that made up the name Pakistan , which also means "" land of the pure "" . Without Kashmir , "" Pakistan "" is literally meaningless . Second , Pakistan 's army has long hankered after the "" strategic depth "" Kashmir would give it . It will never feel utterly safe without it . There is a third reason for fuelling the war , however : at a low cost to Pakistan , it keeps half of India 's army tied up . 
 Syed Ali Shah Geelani , the leader in Indian Kashmir of a breakaway , pro - Pakistan faction of the Hurriyat , sees Kashmiris as victims of a global conspiracy against Muslims , cheated of their rightful incorporation into Pakistan . The talks his former Hurriyat colleagues have opened with Delhi are "" meaningless , unnecessary and futile "" . Similarly , the India - Pakistan dialogue on Kashmir is doomed to "" utter failure "" . "" We are not warmongers , not interested in bloodshed , "" he says , "" but India ignored us for 50 years . "" If the insurgency lasts another 30 years , "" it does n't matter "" . 
 India 's official position mirrors Pakistan 's : it , too , claims the entirety of the old kingdom . But India has long let it be known that it is ready to discuss the permanent division of the state along the old 1949 ceasefire line -- roughly the present line of control , on part of which it is now erecting a fence equipped with high - technology sensors . India also has deep - seated objections to ceding Kashmir . As a secular union , it needs its sole Muslim - majority state , and fears that if Kashmir is granted independence or joins Pakistan , other states may want to leave the union as well . 
 Many Kashmiris would favour neither Pakistan nor India , but independence . Even short of that , they are outraged that India and Pakistan could contemplate discussing their future with no Kashmiris there . Yasin Malik , leader of the Jammu & Kashmir Liberation Front , a secular nationalist group , is running a signature campaign to demand Kashmiri participation in the talks . "" This is not a bilateral issue ; not a border dispute , "" he says , "" It is related to the people of Kashmir . "" He claims to have nearly 1 m signatures already , and hopes to secure 2 m. 
 But how many seats at the table ? And filled by whom ? Sajjad Lone of the People 's Conference , a moderate Hurriyat member , says that , in the search for a solution , "" Kashmiris have been reduced to an ornamental role , because India and Pakistan have made up , and because of the inherent fragmentation of the Kashmiri leadership . "" The Hurriyat itself is split . Then there is the PDP government elected in 2002 , and the other parties that won votes . Umar Farooq , part of the Hurriyat 's delegation to Delhi , concedes that these elected politicians too have constituencies to consider . Then there are the Buddhists of Ladakh and the Hindus of Jammu , who would probably prefer complete incorporation into India . There is also the Hindu minority in the Valley itself , the pandits , most of whom--60,000 families by some estimates -- have fled the Valley for fear of anti - Hindu pogroms . 
 Were Kashmir discussed at such an expanded table , every solution would be unacceptable to somebody . Hurriyat leaders such as Mr Farooq rule out "" trifurcation "" of the Indian state into its three component parts -- in effect , a division along religious lines . Similarly , they would reject the "" Chenab "" formula , under which the state would be repartitioned along the bed of the Chenab river , which would leave most Kashmiri Muslims in Pakistan . India , rejecting a plebiscite , would be no more amenable to one in which people were asked about the future not of the whole state , but of their own district or sub - district . Nor does it seem ready to contemplate imaginative proposals devised by the America - based Kashmir Study Group . These envisage the reconstitution of part of Kashmir as a "" sovereign entity without an international personality""--ie , just short of full independence . 
 Flickers of light 
 There is no public sign that India is prepared to accept anything other than a solution based on the status quo . And as General Musharraf put it last year , in remarks much quoted in Srinagar : "" The line of control is why we have had three wars . That is the dispute . It can never be the solution . "" 
 So is all the talk of breakthroughs and settlements so much hot air -- part of Atal Bihari Vajpayee's campaign for victory in elections to be held this spring , and General Musharraf 's bid for international respectability ? Not quite . Both leaders seem sincere in seeking a peace that is clearly , after all , in both countries ' interests . Atal Bihari Vajpayee has taken bold political gambles to pursue peace even when unremitting hostility has appeared the safer electoral option . General Musharraf is struggling to prove he is part of America 's answer to the scourge of terrorism and not part of the problem . The revelation of Pakistan 's involvement in the sale of nuclear secrets to Libya , Iran and North Korea makes it even more imperative to show evidence of good behaviour elsewhere . The general 's narrow escapes from two assassination attempts late last year -- blamed on extremist Islamists -- also highlighted the dangers of pandering to Pakistan 's jihadi groups . 
 In both countries , says Pran Chopra , a veteran Indian journalist and commentator , "" the circle of sanity is widening . "" But neither has done much to prepare public opinion for a climbdown . General Musharraf has said that both sides must shift a bit , and has hinted at dropping Pakistan 's insistence on a plebiscite . But each country expects concessions from the other . General Musharraf has to contend with elements of his own army and intelligence services and their jihadi clients , who see Pakistan as incomplete without Kashmir . Atal Bihari Vajpayee Vajpayee heads a Hindu nationalist party , one of whose platforms has long been the revocation of Kashmir 's special status under Article 370 . The army in India has never had the clout of its Pakistani counterpart , but it too would find it hard to accept concessions after losing so many lives . An opinion poll in Tehelka , a new weekly newspaper , suggests that 87 % of soldiers see the Kashmir problem as one of terrorism , not a freedom struggle . 
 Even if Indians and Pakistanis could be convinced that peace in Kashmir is worth a few concessions , there remains the difficulty of selling a settlement to disaffected Kashmiris . The Hurriyat 's Umar Farooq says India must soon adopt measures to persuade them that this is a serious peace effort . A huge step forward would be the promised opening of a bus route across the line of control , between Srinagar and Muzaffarabad . It raises tricky issues , notably over travel documents , but holds out the promise of a gradual "" softening "" of the border , allowing Kashmiris to travel , mingle and trade . People - to - people contacts would slowly lessen the importance of political symbols , and India would grant Kashmir greater autonomy . Eventually , India hopes , politicians such as Umar Farooq , the hereditary spiritual leader of the Valley 's Sunni Muslims , might be enticed into mainstream Indian politics . 
 If it works out that way , it would indeed look like an Indian "" victory "" . The difficulty will be to avoid making that look like a Pakistani and Kashmiri defeat .

THE partition of India in 1947 left not so much a scar as an open wound, and Kashmir is where it still bleeds. Two of the three full-scale wars between India and Pakistan were fought over the divided territory, which is claimed by both countries. Just under half is controlled by India, most of the rest by Pakistan. For the past 14 years, the Indian-ruled Kashmir valley has resembled a police state. India has been fighting an insurgency waged partly by Pakistan-trained militants. The dispute has thwarted all attempts at building normal relations between the two countries. 
The most startling of all the hopes kindled in India at the turn of the year was that all this might be about to change. At a regional summit in Islamabad in January, Mr Vajpayee agreed with Pakistan's president and army chief, Pervez Musharraf, that the two countries should start a ""composite dialogue"", which, they hoped, ""will lead to the settlement of all bilateral issues"", including Kashmir.
Such a dream, if realised, would bring enormous benefits to both countries. Most important, it would release Kashmir from its misery, ending a war that has killed at least 40,000 people, possibly many more. Even last year--one of supposedly improving relations and relative peace--the violence cost more than 3,000 lives. A blot on India's international reputation would be removed. Pakistan and India could cut defence spending, a big drain on both their budgets. They could stop frightening the rest of the world with the prospect of a nuclear war: both tested nuclear weapons in 1998, and Pakistan has never ruled out being the first to use them. And they could exploit the almost wholly untapped potential for cross-border trade and investment. 
The breakthrough in Islamabad followed concessions from both sides. India had always resisted even acknowledging the disputed status of Kashmir, and had demanded that Pakistan dismantle ""the infrastructure of terrorism"" before any dialogue opens. Pakistan, for its part, gave assurances that it would not allow its territory to be used to ""support terrorism in any manner""--a reference to its fuelling of the insurgency. If fulfilled, that promise would mean Pakistan's surrendering what it has seen as its only lever over the fate of Kashmir.
This was the culmination of an initiative launched by Mr Vajpayee in April last year in a speech in Srinagar, the summer capital of the Indian state of Jammu & Kashmir. In a remarkable about-turn, he had offered Pakistan the ""hand of friendship"". Ever since terrorists had attacked the Indian parliament in Delhi in December 2001, and India had accused Pakistan of sponsoring the atrocity, India's hand had been brandished only as a fist. In the course of 2002 the two countries came close to war, with hundreds of thousands of soldiers deployed along the border.
But peace-making has been a consistent theme of Mr Vajpayee's term of office. This was his third (and, he said, final) attempt. The first, in 1999, was scuppered by a Pakistani military adventure in the Kargil area of Kashmir, at a time when General Musharraf had not yet staged the coup that made him president. The second came in 2001, when talks broke down because the two sides refused to make these very same concessions on Kashmir. Undaunted, Mr Vajpayee tried again. He wants to be remembered as a statesman. 
He is also, however, an astute politician, and realised that a peace bid would be popular. This was not self-evident. Mr Vajpayee's victory in the most recent general election in 1999 owed much to India's victory in the undeclared Kargil war; in elections in Gujarat in December 2002, his BJP had sailed to victory on a campaign full of vilification of Pakistan. But Mr Vajpayee recognised a national weariness with the constant sparring. Over the summer and autumn of last year, a series of confidence-building measures and of ""people-to-people contacts"" reminded both countries how much they had in common.
Nevertheless, Mr Vajpayee made his offer from what India saw as a position of strength. A state election in Kashmir in 2002 had, unusually, not been rigged, and although the turnout was low, the new state government, committed to a ""healing touch"", had a greater claim to legitimacy than the previous regime. Speaking in Srinagar, the prime minister was reaffirming that this was Indian territory, and would remain so, even if the fighting continued. Debilitating though the war has been, India is a big country and believes that, if necessary, it can fight low-level wars on its periphery indefinitely.
Mr Vajpayee's chief motive in making his friendly overtures was to embarrass Pakistan into reciprocating. Pakistan took its time, but eventually began to respond more enthusiastically to the confidence-building measures, such as the restoration of diplomatic relations and of air, road and rail links, all cut since the attack on parliament. Most significantly, it agreed to discuss the opening of a bus route across the ""line of control"" that divides Kashmir in the absence of an agreed international border (see map, previous page). 
In November, Pakistan offered a ceasefire along the line of control. Indian officials believe shooting over the border is often a cover for infiltration by militant fighters. In the winter the snow in the high mountain passes stops most traffic anyway, but India says that this winter hardly any militants are crossing. General Musharraf has even suggested (and his officials have denied) that Pakistan might ""set aside"" its insistence on the implementation of a United Nations resolution calling for a plebiscite in Kashmir on its future.
Musharraf's gamble
General Musharraf is constrained by popular opinion. Pakistan's Islamist parties, for some of which jihad in Kashmir is a sacred national quest, have been buoyed by a tide of anti-Americanism since the much-resented war in Afghanistan in 2001. The militants also have sympathisers in General Musharraf's own army and intelligence services. Having already taken the risk of backing America in Afghanistan against Pakistan's former allies, to renounce the claim on Kashmir would be suicidal--politically, and perhaps literally as well. In December 2003 General Musharraf narrowly escaped two assassination attempts.
He was also, however, under discreet international pressure from his most important foreign backers--America and China--to prove himself a responsible international citizen. That pressure intensified following revelations that linked Pakistani scientists to nuclear proliferation in North Korea, Iran and Libya. General Musharraf may also see Mr Vajpayee, who is 79, as the only Indian statesman capable of crafting a deal that both allows Pakistan some dignity and placates nationalist hardliners in the BJP. The assassination attempts demonstrated the futility of trying to reconcile the international ""war against terrorism"" with clandestine support for jihadis in Kashmir.
The would-be assassins seem also to have persuaded Indian officials that General Musharraf represents their best hope of a deal. Since the Kargil war, India has never trusted him, but it now believes that were he killed, whoever replaces him is likely to be less accommodating.
So the chances of progress, if not of a resolution, look better than they have done for years. In January, parallel talks opened between the Indian government and the more moderate of Kashmir's separatist leaders. But Indian and Pakistani leaders have been here before. Peace is vulnerable to atrocities by extremists on both sides: a stepping up of infiltration when the snows melt; a Pakistani-sponsored terrorist attack elsewhere in India; or another pogrom directed at India's Muslim minority, like that in Gujarat in March 2002. The process could also be disrupted if assassination, infirmity or an election removes either General Musharraf or Mr Vajpayee from the scene.
Agreeing to talk, moreover, is no more than that. Old habits of thought will be hard to change. Many Indians believe that, sooner or later, Pakistan's soldiers or spies will intervene to thwart peace. Similarly, many Pakistanis believe India wants nothing short of their country's national annihilation. The cynical view is that Mr Vajpayee has bought himself a few months in which he can win an election as a peacemaker, confident that, if his fling with General Musharraf ends in tears, no one will blame him anyway.
In many Indian eyes, a solution to the Kashmir tangle is straightforward: India would drop its claim to Pakistani-occupied Kashmir; Pakistan would do the same for the Indian part; the line of control would gradually become an international border; and India would grant Kashmir greater autonomy. This would deny self-determination to Kashmiris, many of whom want independence from both Pakistan and India. But it would meet India's requirement that no separatist precedent be set for other restive regions, and that its one state with a Muslim majority remain in the Union.
However, such a deal, requiring India to give up only what it does not have, has in the past always foundered on the rock of Pakistani Islamic nationalism. The difficulty will be to keep Kashmir on the agenda, as Pakistan insists, without confronting the hardest issues until a real constituency for peace has been built in both countries.
Coming out
In the cavernous corridors of Delhi's South Block, housing the foreign ministry, Indian diplomats are on a roll. Besides progress towards peace with Pakistan, they are cheering moves towards regional integration and advances in their other two most important bilateral relationships, with America and China.
The breakthrough with Pakistan came at a meeting of the South Asian Association for Regional Co-operation (SAARC), a body rendered largely useless by the unremitting hostility between its two biggest economies. This time, however, it did agree to establish a regional free-trade area from 2006, and Mr Vajpayee is even speaking dreamily about open regional borders, economic union and a single currency, on the model of the European Union. That seems far-fetched. A more modest ambition, however, of a network of co-operative arrangements that raise the price of war, sounds achievable. 
The dreadful punctuation mark left by the September 11th attacks on America interrupted one of the unfolding stories of the post-cold-war world: a gradual shift in American allegiance from one Asian giant--communist, dictatorial, mercantilist China--to another--democratic, liberal, economically unthreatening India. In late 2001, America, to India's bewilderment, found itself locked in an embrace with Pakistan. Yashwant Sinha, India's foreign minister, says India never asks the United States to exert pressure, but that ""if there is a state which is sponsoring terrorism, then the world has a responsibility to the state which is a victim.""
Relations were complicated further when India refused to send soldiers to Iraq. In a country where traditions of anti-imperialism, third-world solidarity and non-violence run deep, the refusal was less surprising than the voices in the BJP arguing for Indian participation, seeing a chance to make common cause with the superpower against terrorist Muslims. On other issues, India has already shown a pragmatic willingness to pursue its perceived national interest at the expense of its ""traditional"" values. Its support for Tibet, for example, whose spiritual leader, the Dalai Lama, has been in exile in India since 1959, has become weaker as relations with China have become more important. And India maintains good links with the generals in Myanmar who throttled the country's democratic movement.
Despite differences over Iraq and Pakistan, however, relations with America are probably, as Mr Sinha boasts, better than ever. Sanctions imposed on India after its nuclear test have been lifted; in January a long-awaited agreement was reached on trade in ""dual-use"" technologies (ie, with a military as well as a civilian application); and co-operation on civilian nuclear technologies, space and missile defence was hailed as taking ""strategic partnership"" to new heights. Similarly, last year saw big strides towards improving the prickly relations with China, which humiliated India in a border war in 1962. Long-running talks on the huge territorial dispute have for the first time gained serious momentum.
""The India that can't say yes"", a phrase used by Stephen Cohen, an American academic, sums up the difficulties foreigners have had in dealing with the place. But now it is recognised, says Mr Sinha, with some justification, as a leading nation on all fronts. As in its early days of independence, India is ""ready once again to engage with the world"". He is optimistic that support is growing for one cherished Indian ambition: a permanent seat on the United Nations Security Council. India, long condescended to as an ""inefficient democracy"", is now earning credit for its achievements and is ready to ""cash the democracy dividend"".

 In November , Pakistan offered a ceasefire along the line of control . Indian officials believe shooting over the border is often a cover for infiltration by militant fighters . In the winter the snow in the high mountain passes stops most traffic anyway , but India says that this winter hardly any militants are crossing . General Musharraf has even suggested ( and his officials have denied ) that Pakistan might "" set aside "" its insistence on the implementation of a United Nations resolution calling for a plebiscite in Kashmir on its future . 
 Musharraf 's gamble 
 General Musharraf is constrained by popular opinion . Pakistan 's Islamist parties , for some of which jihad in Kashmir is a sacred national quest , have been buoyed by a tide of anti - Americanism since the much - resented war in Afghanistan in 2001 . The militants also have sympathisers in General Musharraf 's own army and intelligence services . Having already taken the risk of backing America in Afghanistan against Pakistan 's former allies , to renounce the claim on Kashmir would be suicidal -- politically , and perhaps literally as well . In December 2003 General Musharraf narrowly escaped two assassination attempts . 
 He was also , however , under discreet international pressure from his most important foreign backers -- America and China -- to prove himself a responsible international citizen . That pressure intensified following revelations that linked Pakistani scientists to nuclear proliferation in North Korea , Iran and Libya . General Musharraf may also see Atal Bihari Vajpayee as the only Indian statesman capable of crafting a deal that both allows Pakistan some dignity and placates nationalist hardliners in the BJP . The assassination attempts demonstrated the futility of trying to reconcile the international "" war against terrorism "" with clandestine support for jihadis in Kashmir . 
 The would - be assassins seem also to have persuaded Indian officials that General Musharraf represents their best hope of a deal . Since the Kargil war , India has never trusted him , but it now believes that were he killed , whoever replaces him is likely to be less accommodating . 
 So the chances of progress , if not of a resolution , look better than they have done for years . In January , parallel talks opened between the Indian government and the more moderate of Kashmir 's separatist leaders . But Indian and Pakistani leaders have been here before . Peace is vulnerable to atrocities by extremists on both sides : a stepping up of infiltration when the snows melt ; a Pakistani - sponsored terrorist attack elsewhere in India ; or another pogrom directed at India 's Muslim minority , like that in Gujarat in March 2002 . The process could also be disrupted if assassination , infirmity or an election removes either General Musharraf or Atal Bihari Vajpayee from the scene . 
 Agreeing to talk , moreover , is no more than that . Old habits of thought will be hard to change . Many Indians believe that , sooner or later , Pakistan 's soldiers or spies will intervene to thwart peace . Similarly , many Pakistanis believe India wants nothing short of their country 's national annihilation . The cynical view is that Atal Bihari Vajpayee has bought Atal Bihari Vajpayee a few months in which Atal Bihari Vajpayee can win an election as a peacemaker , confident that , if Atal Bihari Vajpayee's fling with General Musharraf ends in tears , no one will blame Atal Bihari Vajpayee anyway . 
 In many Indian eyes , a solution to the Kashmir tangle is straightforward : India would drop its claim to Pakistani - occupied Kashmir ; Pakistan would do the same for the Indian part ; the line of control would gradually become an international border ; and India would grant Kashmir greater autonomy . This would deny self - determination to Kashmiris , many of whom want independence from both Pakistan and India . But it would meet India 's requirement that no separatist precedent be set for other restive regions , and that its one state with a Muslim majority remain in the Union . 
 However , such a deal , requiring India to give up only what it does not have , has in the past always foundered on the rock of Pakistani Islamic nationalism . The difficulty will be to keep Kashmir on the agenda , as Pakistan insists , without confronting the hardest issues until a real constituency for peace has been built in both countries . 
 Coming out 
 In the cavernous corridors of Delhi 's South Block , housing the foreign ministry , Indian diplomats are on a roll . Besides progress towards peace with Pakistan , they are cheering moves towards regional integration and advances in their other two most important bilateral relationships , with America and China . 
 The breakthrough with Pakistan came at a meeting of the South Asian Association for Regional Co - operation ( SAARC ) , a body rendered largely useless by the unremitting hostility between its two biggest economies . This time , however , it did agree to establish a regional free - trade area from 2006 , and Atal Bihari Vajpayee is even speaking dreamily about open regional borders , economic union and a single currency , on the model of the European Union . That seems far - fetched . A more modest ambition , however , of a network of co - operative arrangements that raise the price of war , sounds achievable . 
 The dreadful punctuation mark left by the September 11th attacks on America interrupted one of the unfolding stories of the post - cold - war world : a gradual shift in American allegiance from one Asian giant -- communist , dictatorial , mercantilist China -- to another -- democratic , liberal , economically unthreatening India . In late 2001 , America , to India 's bewilderment , found itself locked in an embrace with Pakistan . Yashwant Sinha , India 's foreign minister , says India never asks the United States to exert pressure , but that "" if there is a state which is sponsoring terrorism , then the world has a responsibility to the state which is a victim . "" 
 Relations were complicated further when India refused to send soldiers to Iraq . In a country where traditions of anti - imperialism , third - world solidarity and non - violence run deep , the refusal was less surprising than the voices in the BJP arguing for Indian participation , seeing a chance to make common cause with the superpower against terrorist Muslims . On other issues , India has already shown a pragmatic willingness to pursue its perceived national interest at the expense of its "" traditional "" values . Its support for Tibet , for example , whose spiritual leader , the Dalai Lama , has been in exile in India since 1959 , has become weaker as relations with China have become more important . And India maintains good links with the generals in Myanmar who throttled the country 's democratic movement . 
 Despite differences over Iraq and Pakistan , however , relations with America are probably , as Mr Sinha boasts , better than ever . Sanctions imposed on India after its nuclear test have been lifted ; in January a long - awaited agreement was reached on trade in "" dual - use "" technologies ( ie , with a military as well as a civilian application ) ; and co - operation on civilian nuclear technologies , space and missile defence was hailed as taking "" strategic partnership "" to new heights . Similarly , last year saw big strides towards improving the prickly relations with China , which humiliated India in a border war in 1962 . Long - running talks on the huge territorial dispute have for the first time gained serious momentum . 
 "" The India that ca n't say yes "" , a phrase used by Stephen Cohen , an American academic , sums up the difficulties foreigners have had in dealing with the place . But now it is recognised , says Mr Sinha , with some justification , as a leading nation on all fronts . As in its early days of independence , India is "" ready once again to engage with the world "" . He is optimistic that support is growing for one cherished Indian ambition : a permanent seat on the United Nations Security Council . India , long condescended to as an "" inefficient democracy "" , is now earning credit for its achievements and is ready to "" cash the democracy dividend "" .

ONLY a year ago, India seemed in a sorry state. Tension with Pakistan had recently reached such a pitch that nuclear war did not seem inconceivable. An Indian state, Gujarat, had witnessed appalling communal violence between Hindus and Muslims. The economy, after years of drought, was limping along at an annual growth rate of just 4%, not enough to change the fortunes of a nation of a billion people, a quarter of them living in severe poverty.
One year on, in the phrase of its government's propaganda campaign, ""India is shining"". The risk of war seems remote and a historic settlement with Pakistan seems possible. Recent state election campaigns have been marked not by communal antagonism, but voters' mature disgruntlement over bad and corrupt government, pot-holed roads, poisonous water and meagre power supplies. The economy, blessed by a lavish monsoon, is growing by 8% a year or more. Hotels are full of foreigners newly alive to India's potential as both a market and an ""outsourcing"" destination. India fared well in a cricket series in Australia. Indian politicians, businessmen, diplomats and journalists are relishing the new sense of self-confidence. India, said to have been ""emerging"" for years, has at last come out. This is India's decade, crow the optimists; India's century, echo true patriots.
These are big hopes on the back of a solitary good year, and caution is advisable. After a dozen years of opening up and liberalising, India's economy is still relatively small by global measures. With 17% of the world's people, it accounts for less than 2% of global GDP and 1% of world trade. To take the most obvious comparison, China last year saw an increase in its two-way trade with the world of roughly double India's total trade.
Making electoral hay
Indian exuberance is tinged with the rhetoric of an electoral contest. So good are Indians believed to feel about themselves and their government that the prime minister, Atal Behari Vajpayee, has decided to bring forward the general election due by October to this spring. It is only natural that he should be talking up India's prospects, and that his finance minister, Jaswant Singh, should be sprinkling tax cuts and spending promises as if from a bottomless well.
India is a country of extremes, and prone to extreme views about itself. This survey will examine the origins of the present buoyant optimism, and conclude that much of it is overdone: or at least, based on hope rather than achievement. Nor was India in quite such a mess a year ago as the pessimists feared. For a decade, the economy had seen average real growth in GDP of about 6% a year. The hope now is that it is about to take off on a markedly steeper growth path of 8% a year or more, and keep it up.
That sort of acceleration is necessary to provide opportunities for India's growing population and its even-faster-growing workforce. During the present decade, on one estimate India's labour force will expand by 50% more than all of East Asia's (including China's) put together. Without further structural reform, such a growth spurt seems unlikely. But this survey will argue that this is indeed a moment of shining economic opportunity for India, and that if Mr Vajpayee's Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) succeeds in leading its coalition to another election victory, it should be better placed to take advantage of it, and pursue the necessary reform, than has been any government in recent years.
Shining brighter, however, than any GDP growth target is the prospect of some lasting reconciliation with the twin from which India was so bloodily separated at birth in 1947.","After a run of troublesome years , has "" India 's decade "" dawned at last ? Simon Long reviews the prospects

ENTERING India from Pakistan at the Wagah border, in Punjab--the only way across in the absence of direct air links until this January--is a tedious business. A sleepy Pakistani official reads passports in a leisurely way; the customs man searches bags perfunctorily and pesters travellers with offers to change money; porters fight over luggage; a policeman writes names in a big ledger. Then, as if to celebrate an escape from this petty harassment, a big billboard comes into sight: ""India, the world's largest democracy, welcomes you.""
For all the democratic gloss General Musharraf has given his government, it still has a claim to being the world's largest military dictatorship. But the Indian slogan is more than a typical exercise in bilateral point-scoring. India's justified pride in its democratic credentials is an essential part of its international image.
In a federal system with 28 states, it is election season in India most of the time. The season is now at its peak. Mr Vajpayee has announced that he wants to bring forward the general election that, constitutionally, has to be held by October, and hopes to be forming a new government by April. It is, potentially, a decisive moment for India. Mr Vajpayee's ""National Democratic Alliance"" (NDA), a coalition of a score of parties, dominated by the BJP, has been in power since 1998, and looks well placed to win another five-year term. For the opposition Congress Party, which led India to independence and ran it for nearly the next 50 years, that has life-threatening implications.
The election campaign in truth started last year, directed initially at four state polls held on December 1st in which the BJP did well. It regained control of three Congress-held states--Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh--all in the Hindi-speaking belt of northern India, where half of India's people live and general elections are won or lost. Following this success, Mr Vajpayee faced increasing pressure from his party to cash in on the national ""feelgood factor"".
Dynasty
Mr Vajpayee was candid in one explanation he offered for holding an early poll: ""The opposition is in disarray."" Congress is, indeed, in a pickle: there have been bitter intra-party feuds in a number of states, including Kerala in the south and Punjab; and its efforts at finding coalition partners have appeared haphazard and rather desperate. All of this fuels criticism of its Italian-born leader, Sonia Gandhi, the widow of Rajiv Gandhi, a former Indian prime minister assassinated by Sri Lankan Tamil terrorists in 1991.
To the outsider, it seems incredible that Congress, India's oldest and proudest political party, can find no better leader. The BJP will sneer at her foreign origins, though many ordinary voters seem not to mind. More important, despite improving as a public speaker and political operator over the years, she still seems to have little natural appetite or aptitude for the fray. 
Part of the BJP's campaign strategy is to turn the election into a prime-ministerial contest. Mr Vajpayee's stature, for now, is greater than that of any other Indian politician. The opposition has no one to match him, even were Mrs Gandhi to make way for another candidate. She owes her position to a dynastic succession in the family of Jawarhalal Nehru, India's first prime minister, and father of the third, Indira Gandhi, Rajiv's mother. Sonia's daughter, Priyanka, 33, is next in line. Her Indian birth makes her a better long-term bet.
That is, if Congress has a long term. Its leader is not its only handicap. The growth of regional and caste-based parties means that coalition governments seem inevitable for years to come, and compared with the BJP, Congress is an inept coalition-builder--partly because of its arrogance, but also because it is far more of a national party than is the BJP. Often it is one of the two main parties in a state, making it hard to form local alliances. 
So Congress's efforts to form a common front with other parties against the BJP were at first fraught. Left-wing parties such as the Communists, who still run the state of West Bengal, at first preferred to stick with ideological soul-mates. Congress also endured the humiliation of seeking an alliance with the Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK), an opposition party in Tamil Nadu, a big southern state, which it had long shunned for its alleged support for the Tamil Tigers, Rajiv Gandhi's murderers. This heightened the impression that Congress has few principles left.
The party presents itself as the defender of the Nehruvian legacy of secularism against the Hindu-fundamentalist aims of the BJP. Yet it tempers this message when expedient, and it lacks a clear economic policy. The reform process was started by a Congress government in 1991, yet now the party, seeking the votes of the poor, often finds itself taking up populist anti-reform causes.
Wild about saffron
The NDA's reformist credentials are questionable too. The BJP itself, in fact, is at least two parties existing side by side. One is a party of right-of-centre economic liberals, the other is the political wing of a mass social movement called the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS), or Association of National Volunteers, parent of a family of Hindu organisations including the Vishwa Hindu Parishad (VHP) or World Hindu Council.
This BJP has a specific set of policies based on hindutva, or Hinduness. The party rose to national prominence in the early 1990s, on the back of a campaign to rebuild a temple to the god Ram in the town of Ayodhya in Uttar Pradesh. Its supporters claimed the temple had been demolished by Muslim invaders in the 16th century and replaced by a mosque. The campaign culminated in a riot in which the mosque was torn down in December 1992. Terrible communal violence between Hindus and Muslims ensued. 
The temple remains unbuilt, however. The RSS and the BJP both insist they are committed to its construction. However, to attract allies, the BJP agreed to leave the issue to the courts, where cases drag on interminably. Similarly, it has not pursued other hindutva issues, such as the demands for a uniform civil code to supplant the family law applied to Muslims, and the revocation of Kashmir's special status. It has, however, used more subtle ways of painting India saffron, the Hindu holy-man's favourite colour, such as rewriting school history books.
The Gujarat election in December 2002 was a triumph for a BJP following a hardline hindutva campaign. But in the four state elections held a year later, the BJP concentrated on the failings of the incumbent Congress governments. The results were hailed as a vindication of Indian political maturity. 
This is a bit of a stretch. First, it tells only part of the story of the state elections. They were really a victory for the professionalism of the BJP machine, which relies heavily on RSS grass-roots work. Second, ""anti-incumbency"" is always a big factor in Indian elections. The RSS until late last year was saying that it would create a climate where every election candidate had to set out his position on the Ayodhya temple. But it is now talking of the possibility of a negotiated settlement, following a surprising offer to mediate by the Dalai Lama. Ram Madhav, the RSS's spokesman, admits rather sheepishly that the hindutva demands are not central election issues.
Few doubt, however, that the BJP and the RSS would revive them if they looked like vote-winners. The BJP has not, for example, disciplined Narendra Modi, its chief minister in Gujarat, despite compelling evidence that his government connived in the violence in March 2002, in which as many as 2,000 Muslims were murdered. Some suspect that, if the BJP returns to power with more seats, it might step up the pace of ""saffronisation"". 
Sunil Khilnani, of the School of Advanced International Studies in Washington, DC, argues that the BJP is still committed to a ""redrawing of what India is"", including changing the secular constitution. This naturally unsettles minorities, especially Muslims, who make up about 12% of India's population. But it also worries Hindu liberals, who detect an intolerant, xenophobic strain in BJP thought. They point to new restrictions making it harder for Indian non-governmental organisations to receive foreign donations, and new approval procedures for academic conferences on ""political"" subjects. There is also a strain of economic nationalism in the BJP which sits uneasily with the reformists' embrace of globalisation. 
Mr Vajpayee has been adept at holding all these threads together. It is sometimes suggested that without him the NDA might collapse, such is the esteem he enjoys at the moment. BJP rule relies on a motley group of allies. They include Shiv Sena, a right-wing Hindu fundamentalist party with its roots in Mumbai; Samata, a left-wing party strong in Bihar; and the Telugu Desam Party (TDP), a language-based party from Andhra Pradesh known for the modernising zeal of the state's chief minister, Chandrababu Naidu.
Until recently, it had been assumed that Mr Vajpayee might quite soon hand the BJP's reins to his deputy, Lal Krishna Advani, who has been famous as a hardliner ever since he led the Ayodhya campaign in the early 1990s. But the prime minister's recent vigour suggests he hopes to serve another full term, and Mr Advani is also in his mid-70s. So the leadership may eventually pass to a younger generation. Some of the most prominent of these--such as Mr Modi and Arun Jaitley, the law and commerce minister--are both economic liberals and RSS graduates.
Some NDA members and outside supporters, such as the TDP, might find a hardliner difficult to accept as prime minister. But they would probably find it even harder to leave government. Some still hanker, however, after a ""third-force"" government of smaller parties, and an NDA victory is by no means a foregone conclusion. The anti-incumbency vote is not as big in national as in state elections, but the present glow might not erase all memories of what, on average, has been a relatively poor economic performance over the past five years. 
In a number of big states where the NDA did well in the general elections in 1999, it will find it hard to do better. In the biggest state of all, Uttar Pradesh, which has 80 seats (25 of them BJP-held) out of the 545 in the lok sabha, or national parliament, it seems to be relying on the hope of working with the Samajwadi Party after the election. That party currently runs the state government, but its avowedly socialist heritage and its partly Muslim support base preclude a formal alliance. In the south, the BJP's presence is still modest.
The rise of small parties with solid ""vote banks"" in limited geographic, linguistic or caste groups is dispiriting for those hoping for a government with a broad national reformist mandate. So is the quality of elected leadership. J.M. Lyngdoh, until this month head of the independent Election Commission, last year described Indian politicians as a ""cancer"", and said none of them had the greater public good at heart.
Not shepherds but crooks
His gloom resulted from the difficulty of holding free and fair elections. Ruling parties shamelessly bribe voters with, for example, free electricity. In office, politicians switch allegiances as quickly as you can say, ""Join the cabinet"". A new law tightens anti-defection provisions further and, perhaps more usefully, limits the number of ministers a state government can have. At the local level political power is grabbed by strongmen and criminals, and the route to elected office is routinely described as through ""money and muscle"". This can happen anywhere, not just in the wild countryside. Of 70 members of the local legislative assembly in Delhi, 26 face criminal investigation, mostly for ""rioting"".
These details are known because Election Commission rules now require candidates for office to reveal their educational background and criminal record. Along with a free press and an activist Supreme Court, the commission is one of a number of stubbornly independent unelected institutions that help to protect Indian democracy from the elected politicians.

They were really a victory for the professionalism of the BJP machine , which relies heavily on RSS grass - roots work . Second , "" anti - incumbency "" is always a big factor in Indian elections . The RSS until late last year was saying that it would create a climate where every election candidate had to set out his position on the Ayodhya temple . But it is now talking of the possibility of a negotiated settlement , following a surprising offer to mediate by the Dalai Lama . Ram Madhav , the RSS 's spokesman , admits rather sheepishly that the hindutva demands are not central election issues . 
 Few doubt , however , that the BJP and the RSS would revive them if they looked like vote - winners . The BJP has not , for example , disciplined Narendra Modi , its chief minister in Gujarat , despite compelling evidence that his government connived in the violence in March 2002 , in which as many as 2,000 Muslims were murdered . Some suspect that , if the BJP returns to power with more seats , it might step up the pace of "" saffronisation "" . 
 Sunil Khilnani , of the School of Advanced International Studies in Washington , DC , argues that the BJP is still committed to a "" redrawing of what India is "" , including changing the secular constitution . This naturally unsettles minorities , especially Muslims , who make up about 12 % of India 's population . But it also worries Hindu liberals , who detect an intolerant , xenophobic strain in BJP thought . They point to new restrictions making it harder for Indian non - governmental organisations to receive foreign donations , and new approval procedures for academic conferences on "" political "" subjects . There is also a strain of economic nationalism in the BJP which sits uneasily with the reformists ' embrace of globalisation . 
 Atal Bihari Vajpayee has been adept at holding all these threads together . It is sometimes suggested that without Atal Bihari Vajpayee the NDA might collapse , such is the esteem Atal Bihari Vajpayee enjoys at the moment . BJP rule relies on a motley group of allies . They include Shiv Sena , a right - wing Hindu fundamentalist party with its roots in Mumbai ; Samata , a left - wing party strong in Bihar ; and the Telugu Desam Party ( TDP ) , a language - based party from Andhra Pradesh known for the modernising zeal of the state 's chief minister , Chandrababu Naidu . 
 Until recently , it had been assumed that Atal Bihari Vajpayee might quite soon hand the BJP 's reins to Atal Bihari Vajpayee's deputy , Lal Krishna Advani , who has been famous as a hardliner ever since he led the Ayodhya campaign in the early 1990s . But Atal Bihari Vajpayee's recent vigour suggests Atal Bihari Vajpayee hopes to serve another full term , and Mr Advani is also in his mid-70s . So the leadership may eventually pass to a younger generation . Some of the most prominent of these -- such as Atal Bihari Vajpayee and Arun Jaitley , the law and commerce minister -- are both economic liberals and RSS graduates . 
 Some NDA members and outside supporters , such as the TDP , might find a hardliner difficult to accept as prime minister . But they would probably find it even harder to leave government . Some still hanker , however , after a "" third - force "" government of smaller parties , and an NDA victory is by no means a foregone conclusion . The anti - incumbency vote is not as big in national as in state elections , but the present glow might not erase all memories of what , on average , has been a relatively poor economic performance over the past five years . 
 In a number of big states where the NDA did well in the general elections in 1999 , it will find it hard to do better . In the biggest state of all , Uttar Pradesh , which has 80 seats ( 25 of them BJP - held ) out of the 545 in the lok sabha , or national parliament , it seems to be relying on the hope of working with the Samajwadi Party after the election . That party currently runs the state government , but its avowedly socialist heritage and its partly Muslim support base preclude a formal alliance . In the south , the BJP 's presence is still modest . 
 The rise of small parties with solid "" vote banks "" in limited geographic , linguistic or caste groups is dispiriting for those hoping for a government with a broad national reformist mandate . So is the quality of elected leadership . J.M. Lyngdoh , until this month head of the independent Election Commission , last year described Indian politicians as a "" cancer "" , and said none of them had the greater public good at heart . 
 Not shepherds but crooks 
 His gloom resulted from the difficulty of holding free and fair elections . Ruling parties shamelessly bribe voters with , for example , free electricity . In office , politicians switch allegiances as quickly as you can say , "" Join the cabinet "" . A new law tightens anti - defection provisions further and , perhaps more usefully , limits the number of ministers a state government can have . At the local level political power is grabbed by strongmen and criminals , and the route to elected office is routinely described as through "" money and muscle "" . This can happen anywhere , not just in the wild countryside . Of 70 members of the local legislative assembly in Delhi , 26 face criminal investigation , mostly for "" rioting "" . 
 These details are known because Election Commission rules now require candidates for office to reveal their educational background and criminal record . Along with a free press and an activist Supreme Court , the commission is one of a number of stubbornly independent unelected institutions that help to protect Indian democracy from the elected politicians .

INDIANS' mood swings about their economic prospects have an ""eerie cyclicality"" about them, says Suman Bery, head of the National Council for Applied Economic Research, a Delhi think-tank. Glee follows dismay with only the most fleeting halt at guarded optimism. Even now, most of the apparent good news can, to the gloomy, seem reason to worry: the bulging workforce becomes a looming unemployment crisis; the booming IT industry, a dangerously isolated enclave; even subdued inflation and interest rates, signals of weak demand and a lack of investment. 
With a soaring stockmarket, low interest rates and a surfeit of animal spirits, you would expect India to be enjoying an investment boom. It is not. There is some evidence that one might be in the offing. By the end of last year, manufacturing industry was adding fixed assets at a rate of 8.5% a year. The Reserve Bank's Mr Reddy points to increased demand for bank loans; imports of capital goods have also been rising. The Confederation of Indian Industry (CII), a business lobby, says that about 150 manufacturing companies have announced new investment projects, in addition to an expected investment of $7 billion in telecommunications and $2.5 billion in road-building.
However, concerns about the pace of capital spending and about access to credit for enterprises have not dissipated. A Reserve Bank study published in December concluded that corporate investment might actually fall in this fiscal year compared with last. There are two conventional explanations for this. First, that 52% of GDP, and some of its most dynamic components, are in services, which are not capital-intensive. Second, according to one estimate in early 2003, 21% of manufacturing capacity lay unused after the investment splurge of the mid-1990s. Only when this slack is taken up will companies start investing again. In the meantime, banks are pouring far more money into government bonds than statutory liquidity requirements demand. 
Foreigners are helping to drive up the stockmarket, but are still wary of direct investment. Their contribution looks bigger than it did, now that the Reserve Bank has restated the figures in line with international practice. But it still reported only $4.7 billion in foreign direct investment in the fiscal year ending in 2003, less than a tenth of what China attracted in 2002.
The continued caution of foreign and Indian investors alike is not surprising. The structural impediments to investment in India have been eased but not removed. They include restrictive labour laws that make it hard to shed staff. Nor, despite improvements in some areas, have the deficiencies in India's infrastructure--roads, electricity, water supply--been fixed. Laws complicating land transactions, and the labyrinthine intricacies and glacial pace of litigation, are further deterrents. So is a cumbersome and corrupt bureaucracy that adds time and cost to almost any commercial project.
In recent years, investment has tended to make up little more than 20% of India's GDP. To achieve its 8% growth target, India badly needs to increase that proportion and to improve the efficiency with which capital is used.
Don't mention it
The government's ability to do this, however, is limited by the appalling state of its finances. Its budget deficit is now like an embarrassing foul smell. To draw attention to it seems in poor taste. Confronted with the worries voiced by the World Bank and the IMF, officials wearily point out that these organisations have been giving warning of impending crisis for years, and everything is going swimmingly.
The public-sector budget deficit has been running at around 10% of GDP for the past six years (see chart 6), a very high level by international standards. Rather more than half of the deficit is accounted for by the central government; most of the rest by profligate states. The fear is that this might lead to higher inflation, and that the government's demand for funds will push up interest rates, crowd out private investment, weaken the financial system and leave the economy vulnerable if hit by a big macroeconomic shock. 
For the time being, however, there is little sign of an imminent crisis. Neither central nor state governments are likely to default, and the deficit is financed not by foreign borrowing, but by a high savings rate and a compliant banking system (in which state-owned banks account for 90% of deposits). Mr Singh, the finance minister, earlier this month forecast a marked fall in the deficit for the current fiscal year. Elections, however, usually end up widening the gap. Optimists argue that, in the longer term, faster growth will bring higher tax receipts and reduce the deficit.
But the deficit already hampers growth by limiting government spending on infrastructure, education and health. Almost all the money goes on interest payments (some 43% of recurrent expenses), civil-service wages and pensions, defence and subsidies. A fiscal-responsibility law passed last year requires the government to eliminate the revenue deficit by 2008, and gradually to reduce the central-government fiscal deficit as a percentage of GDP. It is hard to see how this is to be achieved. 
Last year, an outcry prevented Mr Singh from fulfilling a budget commitment to lower the government's subsidy of the price of fertiliser. A powerful farmers' lobby in the richer agricultural states blocks reform of an arcane, costly and counterproductive system in which the government both subsidises agricultural inputs and procures wheat and rice at above-market prices, supposedly to sell cheaply to the poor (much gets diverted before it reaches them). 
Mr Singh did, however, push through another unpopular measure: a reduction in the interest rates the government pays on small-savings schemes. These, supposedly designed to encourage thrift, are an expensive source of funds and keep interest rates higher than they need be. They are, however very popular with middle-class voters, and with the state governments who use them to raise money. As Surjit Bhalla of Oxus Fund Management in Delhi has tirelessly pointed out, they have become a national pyramid scheme with a pernicious effect.
Many economists argue, however, that if the deficit is to be tackled, the best hope lies on the revenue side. The ratio of total government tax revenue to GDP, at 9-10%, is actually lower than it was in the early 1990s. A decade of 6% annual GDP growth seems to have been marked by an even faster growth in tax evasion. Since Mr Singh himself has described the tax system as ""suspicion-ridden, harassment-generating, coercion-inclined"", this is perhaps not surprising. It is sometimes said that the ""licence raj"" abolished in 1991 has been supplanted by an ""exemption raj"". 
A simpler, cleaner system, recommended by a government-appointed committee and endorsed by Mr Singh in his budget speech last year, might also generate more revenue. But reform of the tax regime is no easier than any other structural change. For example, harmonisation of India's cascading sales taxes by introducing a uniform national value-added tax has repeatedly been postponed. So the country has the worst of both worlds: indirect taxes push up the price of Indian goods far beyond the level of, for example, comparable Chinese products, yet the government's tax base grows no wider.
As the experience of the past ten years suggests, there is an even chance that the deficit will constrain growth even more than it does at present, rather than that growth will reduce the deficit. If private investment does pick up as hoped, then interest rates might have to rise quite quickly, choking the economy just as it is gathering momentum. Such a ""death by slow strangulation"", in the words of one IMF official, is more of a risk than a sudden crisis.
What is to be done
For the IMF and others, India is a case study proving that economic reform works. Reform has brought faster growth, particularly in those parts of the country and of the economy that have opened up most to competition, and have been least shackled by government. The most obvious example is the IT industry. Yet the arguments for reform have to be rehearsed over and over again, partly because of entrenched intellectual traditions of autarky and socialism, but mainly because reform threatens vested interests.
Mr Singh thinks that there is now a ""broad consensus"" in favour of reform, and that the ""Indian polity has learned a great deal about the merits of liberalisation and the perils of populism."" He admits that, at election time, politicians play to the gallery, but sent an encouraging signal in January by announcing a liberalisation of foreign-ownership rules in banks and retail oil companies.
The privatisation process started in 1999 is likely to speed up this year as the government takes advantage of the stockmarket boom. But many of the ""second-generation"" reforms rely on state governments. These include, for example, turning electricity provision from a loss-making activity of state-owned boards into a commercial business, by unbundling generation, transmission and distribution. 
State-government finances badly need rehabilitation if the rural majority is to get much-needed investment: in roads, where many villages remain cut off; in irrigation, to help free more farmers from the tyranny of the monsoon; in education, where nearly 20% of children receive no education at all and 35% of the population are illiterate; in health, where 70 out of every 1,000 children die in their first year, and at least 4.6m people are infected with HIV, which in some areas has spread from high-risk groups into the wider population.
Some grand schemes are afoot to lift the countryside. Mr Vajpayee's ""Golden Quadrilateral"" project of highways linking Delhi, Kolkata, Chennai and Mumbai is part of a broader road-building campaign to improve village ""connectivity"". There is also a visionary (as well as hugely controversial and, at $120 billion, costly) scheme to end India's floods and droughts by linking rivers and moving water across the subcontinent. More practically, schools are required to provide mid-day meals for their pupils--a boost to nutrition, enrolment and attendance.
In many poverty-stricken areas, the most serious problem is not the lack of funds, or poor policy. It is the bureaucratic inability or unwillingness to deliver. Take India's poorest state, Bihar.","Too little investment ; too big a deficit ; too few jobs

NO ONE could accuse the statement issued by senior diplomats from India and Pakistan on February 18th of being riveting. It was full of the jargon of ""technical-level meetings"", ""expert-level talks"" and ""composite dialogue"". But when you have been to the brink of war, there is a lot to be said for diplomatic routine. In the humdrum lies the breakthrough.
The statement, which followed three days of talks in Islamabad, was a rough schedule for a series of bilateral meetings between officials, leading up to one between the two foreign ministers in August. Fulfilling a promise made by India's prime minister, Atal Behari Vajpayee, and Pakistan's president and army chief, Pervez Musharraf, when they met in January, the talks will cover all the disputes between the two countries, including the bitterest of them all--Kashmir.
Riaz Khokar, Pakistan's most senior diplomat, said there was ""a realisation on both sides that war is not an option"". After three wars since independence in 1947, the testing of nuclear bombs in 1998, a bloody conflict in Kashmir in 1999, and the massing of a million troops along the shared border in 2002, that realisation, if genuine, changes everything.
Cynics point out that, in fact, India and Pakistan have been here before. The ""composite dialogue"" is largely a revival of a process tried and abandoned six years ago, and so far little has been achieved apart from a synchronisation of personal organisers. But the atmosphere is better than anyone can remember. An agreement to hold talks on nuclear confidence-building measures is especially heartening.
The two countries used never to miss a chance to discomfit each other. Yet India has refrained from making political capital from the recent revelations of Pakistan's involvement in spreading nuclear technology to Iran, Libya and North Korea. It also helped that, just before this week' s talks, India confirmed that its cricket team would come to Pakistan in March. The tour was under threat because of worries about the players' safety (or even their performance, given the effects of a bad result on India's imminent elections).
India has also stopped harping on its demand that Pakistan dismantle the camps from which Pakistanis and others have been launched into Indian-administered Kashmir to join the long insurgency there. Pakistan, for its part, did not raise India's much-resented construction of a fence along part of the disputed ""line of control"" that divides Kashmir. Nor has India's continued hunting down of militants in Kashmir interrupted the nascent peace process. Pakistan television, however, continues to broadcast harrowing propaganda on alleged Indian repression in Kashmir. Mr Khokar said it would be ""helpful"" if human-rights violations of this kind stopped.
Many Pakistani analysts suspect India of wanting to string Pakistan along, discussing relatively minor disputes, and making progress on improving transport, economic, cultural and other links, while refusing to engage on the core issue of Kashmir. They may well be right. But it may also be true that Pakistan will ultimately be ready to yield far more on Kashmir than it is suggesting in public. As Tanvir Ahmed Khan, one of Mr Khokar's predecessors as top official in the foreign ministry, puts it, ""there is a grudging recognition that some of the myths that Pakistan has lived by are no longer tenable"". Even the army may have decided that the costs of backing the insurgency in Kashmir now outweigh the probable benefits. 
Pakistani diplomats were privately amazed at how easily the talks had gone. The process is new-born and fragile and has yet to begin the real business of negotiation. But the two countries are glimpsing the remote possibility of a lasting peace. If the goal is that exciting, who cares if the journey is boring?

In strife-racked Kashmir, all four.
The BJP's platform has two main planks: an economy that, this fiscal year, is expected to have grown by more than 8%; and Mr Vajpayee himself, India's most respected politician, and the instigator of popular peace talks with Pakistan.

Its leader, Sonia Gandhi, is the Italian-born widow of Rajiv Gandhi, a Congress prime minister like his mother and grandfather. The BJP makes much of her origins, and Congress's dynastic obsessions.
Both parties know that the next government, like this one, will be a coalition. They are busy forming alliances with regional and caste-based parties. Polls suggest that the BJP's confidence is justified; but it may find itself as dependent as in the last parliament on a motley set of partners.

AS AN American ally, Pakistan is an embarrassment. Its ruler, General Pervez Musharraf, seized power in a bloodless coup in 1999. His efforts since then to legitimise himself have been marred by a farcical referendum, electoral manipulation, and concessions to Pakistan's Islamist extremists. The country has been the launch-pad for terrorist attacks in India. Worse still, it has proved to be the headquarters of a global mail-order business in nuclear-bomb technology, with Libya, Iran and North Korea as its known customers. If not a member of George Bush's ""axis of evil"", Pakistan seems to have been doing its best to meet the eligibility criteria.
So when Colin Powell, America's secretary of state, visits Pakistan on March 17th, he will have some harsh words for his hosts. But only in private. Since September 11th 2001, Pakistan has been an irreplaceable American partner. Its airspace and logistical support were essential for the war against the Taliban in Afghanistan in late 2001. Its co-operation remains vital to the continuing hunt for Mullah Omar, the Taliban's leader, and for Osama bin Laden. In an operation now under way in the remote and lawless areas along the Pakistan-Afghan border, Pakistani soldiers are trying to drive al-Qaeda remnants into the arms of their American allies.
America and Pakistan have strongly denied reports of an explicit deal to allow American troops to operate from Pakistan in return for a lenient approach to Pakistan's proliferation sins. But November's presidential election makes catching Mr bin Laden an ever more important symbolic moment in the ""war against terrorism""--an American general has said it will happen this year. Whether or not Americans are crossing the border, their spyplanes are certainly patrolling it. And as the winter snows melt, the co-ordinated attack has intensified. In what is called a breakthrough, the 70,000 Pakistani soldiers will be helped by hundreds of Zalikhel tribesmen from Waziristan, who agreed on March 7th to join the hunt for fugitives and those harbouring them. 
Policy towards Pakistan lays America open to the charge of hypocrisy. On February 25th, America's State Department issued its annual human-rights report. A damning section on Pakistan noted that the government was dominated by the army and the intelligence services, and its human-rights record remained poor. The next day, Mr Powell appeared before Congress to justify the department's budget for the coming year, including $5.7 billion in assistance for countries ""that have joined us in the war against terrorism"". Top of the list, with $700m, was Pakistan.
Here comes the hero
Behind America's willingness to tolerate Pakistan's undemocratic ways lies the hope that, under General Musharraf, it can deliver not just al-Qaeda fugitives, but stability in the world's only nuclear-armed Islamic Republic. A reminder that Pakistan will not easily relinquish that status came this week when it tested a new missile capable of carrying nuclear warheads to most Indian cities. The fear is that the country might lurch into Islamist extremism, and its nuclear technology fall into even more dangerous hands. This gives rise to a paradox: that the army, the bastion against the fundamentalist threat, has an interest in keeping that threat alive.
The general is supposed to be the man who can resolve these contradictions, as indispensable to Pakistan's future as Pakistan is to America's fight against terrorism. In this version of the story, he plays the hero: paving the way for full restoration of democracy, stemming the slide into Islamic fundamentalism, plugging the leaks in the country's nuclear-technology apparatus, and reaching an historic peace with the old enemy, India.
Attempts on his life have helped foster this image. Would-be assassins last December included two suicide bombers--an Afghan and a Kashmiri. Much seems to hinge on his continued survival. ""It's election year,"" says Samina Ahmed, Islamabad representative of the International Crisis Group (ICG), an independent research outfit, ""and the Americans have put all their eggs in Musharraf's basket."" 
India has distrusted the general since 1999 when, as army chief, he oversaw a military adventure in the Kargil area of Kashmir at a time when peace hopes had been kindled. But it too seems to have come round to the idea that Pakistan's president may be a better partner in peace talks than any likely replacement. Atal Behari Vajpayee, India's prime minister, has expressed concern for his safety. 
Four dangerous perceptions
While acknowledging that he is taking big political and personal risks, many Pakistanis take a less charitable view of General Musharraf. They see him as just the latest in a line of Pakistani soldiers to grow weary of the uncertainties of the democratic process, and to override it. Like one such predecessor, General Zia ul Haq, who ruled from 1977 to 1988, General Musharraf has bolstered his position at home by building up the country's small but passionate extremist Islamist fringe. Yet, to justify his dictatorship to the Americans, he points to the threat posed by these very same Islamists.
This secular, democratic general, photographed cuddling pooches, and said to be partial to a peg of whisky, seems at times more popular with the mullahs than the politicians. On January 17th, he made an inspirational speech to a joint session of the two houses of parliament. Noting that Pakistan's Islamic Republic was perceived overseas as ""intolerant and pro-extremism"", he called for a ""jihad against extremism"". His speech was almost drowned out by the barracking of elected parliamentarians. A month later, undaunted, he took the same message to an even more forbidding audience--a gathering of 2,000 ulemas, or Islamic teachers. From them he received a standing ovation.
""Our generals have been wrong on everything,"" says Pervez Hoodhbhoy, a peace activist and professor of physics at Islamabad's Quaid-i-Azam university. His charge-sheet is convincing. The army's backing of the Taliban ruined Afghanistan, and has left those parts of Pakistan dominated, like the Taliban, by ethnic Pushtuns, deeply disillusioned by the decision to help America's war. The generals' acquiescence or active connivance in the proliferation of nuclear technology (or even, just conceivably, their ignorance of it) may have endangered the whole world. Their provision of money, training and cannon-fodder for the 14-year insurrection against Indian rule in Kashmir brought misery to that land, put Pakistan on the wrong side in the war against terror, and utterly failed in its objectives.
Curiously, General Musharraf seems to share Mr Hoodhbhoy's analysis. Amid the cat-calls in parliament he was citing the very same three issues, along with Islamic extremism, as ""four dangerous perceptions"" to which Pakistan is subject. Correcting them, he suggested, might ""save the country"", and he suggested remedies. Many Pakistanis, however, doubt his seriousness in pursuing these remedies. They see an astute political tactician, who has yet to take the strategic decision to abandon failed policies.
On Afghanistan, the president promised parliament a ""massive operation against those foreign elements in our border areas"". Pakistan is credited with doing much to root out al-Qaeda fugitives, both from its wild fringes and from the cities where some have hidden among the multitudes. But it has done less to help wipe out the vestiges of the Taliban. 
That is perhaps not surprising. The Afghan fundamentalists were, after all, nurtured by Pakistan's spooks, the Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI), and retain much sympathy among their Pushtun ethnic kin across the porous border. But there are also suspicions that Pakistan is playing a double game in Afghanistan, helping the Taliban to survive to insure against the emergence of an unfriendly regime in Kabul. 
In 2001, when General Musharraf dumped the Taliban in favour of America, there was speculation that the switch would provoke such anger among Pakistan's Islamists that he might be swept from power. There were indeed some large and unruly protests, but none that came near to mounting such a challenge. 
Similarly this year, the general weathered another storm: the public humiliation of a great national hero, Abdul Qadeer Khan. The exposure of Mr Khan, a metallurgist, as the hub of a network of nuclear-technology proliferation has left many seeing him as a fall-guy for crimes that could not have been committed without the knowledge of the army top brass. But his televised confession did at least give General Musharraf a prop on which to rest his denials. Some Pakistanis joke that Mr Khan, who brought Pakistan the bomb and so ensured its survival alongside a hostile neighbour, India, has, by taking the rap, saved the country for a second time.
He also saved himself. In deference to the scientist's enormous prestige, the president let him off scot-free (""conditionally""). Remarkably, the American and British governments, in public at least, were happy to treat this as an internal Pakistani affair. Just as remarkable to some observers was the muted reaction in Pakistan to the debunking of a national icon. Strikes called in his support soon fizzled.
But Khurshid Ahmed, chairman of the Institute of Policy Studies, an Islamabad think-tank, argues it would be ""highly superficial"" to say that General Musharraf has escaped a popular backlash. According to Mr Ahmed, who is also a senator for Jamaat-i-Islami, part of the Muttahida Majlis-i-Amal (MMA), an alliance of six Islamist parties, ""A.Q. Khan is loved by the common man. Musharraf is hated.""
That may be true. But it does seem that public opinion allows the generals more leeway than they prefer to admit. ""They put their hands behind their backs"", says Mr Hoodhbhoy, ""and pretend they are tied."" He thinks this may even be true of the policy stance that Pakistanis see as the most fundamental of all: support for the struggle for self-determination of Muslims in Indian-controlled Kashmir. 
Solving Kashmir
Since 1990, one form that support has taken has been the clandestine sponsorship of armed insurgency. General Musharraf has repeatedly promised to stop ""cross-border infiltration"", most recently in a breakthrough meeting with Mr Vajpayee in January. This time, he may just mean it.
He is under pressure from America and from Pakistan's other important ally, China. When he visited Beijing in November, he was left in no doubt that his hosts, who have been vital providers of arms, and of missile and nuclear technology, were fed up with Pakistan's cosseting of jihadis. Besides destabilising Afghanistan and liberating Kashmir, some holy warriors also want to bring down Chinese rule in what was briefly East Turkestan and is now the Chinese region of Xinjiang.
Indian officials are reserving judgment. Infiltration of armed militants from Pakistani- to Indian-administered Kashmir has abated. But in the winter months anyway, Himalayan snow slows it to a trickle. There is little sign yet that Pakistan is dismantling the dozens of militant training camps. 
The way to dispel suspicions about Pakistan's activities in Kashmir, General Musharraf told parliament, is ""to find its just solution"". That is the hope held out by the start last month of a series of meetings on Kashmir and other bilateral issues between senior Pakistani and Indian officials. But a solution will not be possible on Pakistan's terms: a plebiscite in the former kingdom of Jammu & Kashmir, half of which is now under Indian administration, on the region's future. 
It is often argued that Pakistan's room for negotiation is limited by popular opinion, formed by decades of indoctrination, starting in the schoolroom, about the injustice and cruelty of Indian rule in Kashmir. But some Pakistanis dispute this. Outside parts of Punjab province, home to many of the Pakistani soldiers and militants who have died in Kashmir, many people are weary of the whole conflict, realise it cannot be won and hanker after a lasting reconciliation with India. 
Those moderate mullahs
Peace with India is even popular with all but an extremist fringe of Pakistan's Islamist parties. The MMA's Mr Ahmed remains suspicious of Indian intentions, saying that ""Pakistan cannot, must not, will not do a deal that the people of Jammu & Kashmir cannot accept."" But he insists that the MMA wants peace and is a force for moderation, having no sympathy at all for ""the Taliban model"".
The MMA is partly an invention of the army and the ISI. In the October 2002 elections, the generals were keen not to see too strong a performance from the two main secular opposition parties: the Muslim League, led by Nawaz Sharif, whom General Musharraf overthrew in his coup; and the Pakistan People's Party (PPP) of Benazir Bhutto, another former prime minister. So they impeded their campaigns, which already suffered from their leaders' absences in exile, and helped forge a coalition of the usually fractious Islamist fringe.
This unlikely alliance, capitalising on the fury of Pakistan's Pushtun minority at the war in Afghanistan, enjoyed unprecedented success. It won only 11% of the vote. But that was enough to give it 60 out of 342 parliamentary seats, as well as control of one of the four provincial governments, in North-West Frontier, and a share in a coalition (with General Musharraf's loyalists) in another, in Baluchistan.
For a year, the democratic faade the elections were supposed to produce was obscured by parliament's refusal to ratify General Musharraf's self-serving changes to the constitution. These gave him, as president, unprecedented power, and will, through a new National Security Council, entrench the army's role in politics. Last December, he struck a deal with the MMA. In return for his promise to stand down as army chief by the end of 2004, it accepted his presidency until 2007, and his proposed constitutional changes. Not for the first time, a general found a bargain with the Islamists more palatable than making concessions to the secular opposition.
Optimists hope that this was a one-shot deal. Amending the constitution required a two-thirds majority in parliament. Governing does not. But that is to overestimate General Musharraf's faith in his own supporters, and to ignore the frailty of their parliamentary majority. The Pakistan Muslim League (Q) faction that backs him is less a political party than a random gathering of toadies and chancers. Both Mr Sharif and Miss Bhutto face arrest if they return to Pakistan. But they pose more of a real threat to the president than do the Islamists. Miss Bhutto in particular has been vocal in exploiting General Musharraf's nuclear embarrassment. So he continues to need the MMA. 
At the very least that will make it difficult for the government to reverse Islamic legislation, such as a much-abused blasphemy law, or the Hudood ordinances, one effect of which is that 88% of women in Pakistani prisons were convicted of fornication, probably because they had been raped. An ICG report published in January, called ""Unfulfilled Promises"", highlights the government's continued failure to regulate the thousands of religious schools, or madrassas, the most radical of which have spawned the Taliban and Pakistani jihadis. The army's failure to take on Islamic extremism means, in Ms Ahmed's cruel summary, that ""America is backing the military that is backing the mullahs that are backing the jihadis.
That, in essence, is the Pakistani conundrum. At home, it means that General Musharraf deals with Islamist parties in preference to the Muslim League and the PPP, whose policies are far closer to those he professes. The sanguine view is that, because he represents the army, whose senior command he has shuffled in his image, and the army remains the ultimate arbiter of power, he still represents the best chance of achieving the fundamental reforms Pakistan needs. 
A commando still
The present government's economic record, at least, deserves respect. And no civilian leader, none of whom has ever completed a term in office, would be able to make the necessary about-turns on Afghanistan and Kashmir. The gloomy view is that the general's power will fade when he takes off his uniform, bringing a new round of political uncertainty. Or perhaps there will be another constitutional change, or, according to the latest rumour, promotion to ""Field-Marshal"".
Ever since seizing power, General Musharraf has spoken passionately and persuasively of the need to shed the backward-looking, repressive and anti-western influence of extremist Islam. Abroad, his standing rests on his credentials as Pakistan's saviour from that strategic threat. Yet to stay in power, and to burnish those credentials, he needs to offer tactical concessions to the extremists. Modernisers and fundamentalists alike may be disappointed in him. The MMA's Mr Ahmed could be speaking for both sets of critics: ""We gave him the opportunity to become a statesman; he remains a commando.""","One of America's most important partners in the war against terror, Pakistan is also one of its biggest worries

In the October 2002 elections, the generals were keen not to see too strong a performance from the two main secular opposition parties: the Muslim League, led by Nawaz Sharif, whom General Musharraf overthrew in his coup; and the Pakistan People's Party (PPP) of Benazir Bhutto, another former prime minister. So they impeded their campaigns, which already suffered from their leaders' absences in exile, and helped forge a coalition of the usually fractious Islamist fringe.
This unlikely alliance, capitalising on the fury of Pakistan's Pushtun minority at the war in Afghanistan, enjoyed unprecedented success. It won only 11% of the vote. But that was enough to give it 60 out of 342 parliamentary seats, as well as control of one of the four provincial governments, in North-West Frontier, and a share in a coalition (with General Musharraf's loyalists) in another, in Baluchistan.
For a year, the democratic faade the elections were supposed to produce was obscured by parliament's refusal to ratify General Musharraf's self-serving changes to the constitution. These gave him, as president, unprecedented power, and will, through a new National Security Council, entrench the army's role in politics. Last December, he struck a deal with the MMA. In return for his promise to stand down as army chief by the end of 2004, it accepted his presidency until 2007, and his proposed constitutional changes. Not for the first time, a general found a bargain with the Islamists more palatable than making concessions to the secular opposition.
Optimists hope that this was a one-shot deal. Amending the constitution required a two-thirds majority in parliament. Governing does not. But that is to overestimate General Musharraf's faith in his own supporters, and to ignore the frailty of their parliamentary majority. The Pakistan Muslim League (Q) faction that backs him is less a political party than a random gathering of toadies and chancers. Both Mr Sharif and Miss Bhutto face arrest if they return to Pakistan. But they pose more of a real threat to the president than do the Islamists. Miss Bhutto in particular has been vocal in exploiting General Musharraf's nuclear embarrassment. So he continues to need the MMA. 
At the very least that will make it difficult for the government to reverse Islamic legislation, such as a much-abused blasphemy law, or the Hudood ordinances, one effect of which is that 88% of women in Pakistani prisons were convicted of fornication, probably because they had been raped. An ICG report published in January, called ""Unfulfilled Promises"", highlights the government's continued failure to regulate the thousands of religious schools, or madrassas, the most radical of which have spawned the Taliban and Pakistani jihadis. The army's failure to take on Islamic extremism means, in Ms Ahmed's cruel summary, that ""America is backing the military that is backing the mullahs that are backing the jihadis.
That, in essence, is the Pakistani conundrum. At home, it means that General Musharraf deals with Islamist parties in preference to the Muslim League and the PPP, whose policies are far closer to those he professes. The sanguine view is that, because he represents the army, whose senior command he has shuffled in his image, and the army remains the ultimate arbiter of power, he still represents the best chance of achieving the fundamental reforms Pakistan needs. 
A commando still
The present government's economic record, at least, deserves respect. And no civilian leader, none of whom has ever completed a term in office, would be able to make the necessary about-turns on Afghanistan and Kashmir. The gloomy view is that the general's power will fade when he takes off his uniform, bringing a new round of political uncertainty. Or perhaps there will be another constitutional change, or, according to the latest rumour, promotion to ""Field-Marshal"".
Ever since seizing power, General Musharraf has spoken passionately and persuasively of the need to shed the backward-looking, repressive and anti-western influence of extremist Islam. Abroad, his standing rests on his credentials as Pakistan's saviour from that strategic threat. Yet to stay in power, and to burnish those credentials, he needs to offer tactical concessions to the extremists. Modernisers and fundamentalists alike may be disappointed in him. The MMA's Mr Ahmed could be speaking for both sets of critics: ""We gave him the opportunity to become a statesman; he remains a commando.""",750,India,A29-8257,,False,,0,True

Its offer of 10% of the shares in ONGC, an oil exploration and production company, was the last of a hectic spate of six privatisation issues. The offering was fully sold within minutes, and when it closes on March 13th will raise some 100 billion rupees ($2.2 billion).

Like reform itself, the minister has suffered his share of setbacks. One came last September, when the Supreme Court ruled that the privatisation of two state oil companies required a vote in parliament. This had the effect of stalling his favoured method of disposing of the government's assets--selling control to strategic investors, rather than minority chunks to the market. At the time, Mr Shourie vented his frustration by saying the ruling showed the difference between India and China: ""In India, everybody has a veto.""
Mr Shourie was a well-known author and journalist before he was head-hunted into the unelected upper house of India's parliament by the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), which heads India's ruling coalition, in 1998. His last book, ""Courts and their Judgments"", complained about the way India's law courts have extended their roles, because of the shortcomings of India's other institutions.

It will draw on his experience of trying to practise what he used to preach as an economist at the World Bank, since he became minister of ""disinvestment"" in 2001.
Mr Shourie likes to cite a study of the Kuomintang's China in 1936: ""administration degenerates into mere correspondence.""

He found that not one of the 30-odd hotels in the group had the title deed to its lands. Demerging the company to sell the properties individually needed the consent of all the employees, who held 0.5% of the equity. Securing a list of its debts took six months. One Delhi hotel was embroiled in a 15-year lawsuit with another arm of government about its ground rent. Mr Shourie recalls his exasperated plea to his civil servants: ""It must be written in some bloody document.""

""I am a graduate of the Indian Express; we exhaust the other fellows."" Victims of this persistence include not just civil servants and judges, but politicians. After about 20 parliamentary debates on privatisation in the past four years, the most recent were adjourned for want of a quorum.
As this implies, Mr Shourie sees the politicians themselves as obstacles to getting things done. ""The quality of many who people our public life--that is not democracy, it is disarray, it is free-fall."" Yet he refuses to use India's democratic system as an excuse for the country's painfully slow pace of economic progress over the past 20 years compared with China. ""Governance"", he argues, ""is not golf: that we are a democracy does not entitle us to a handicap.""

There often seem to be more stops than starts in the Indian reform process. But much has been achieved since 1991, when the old system of industrial licensing and import controls was overturned in favour of gradual liberalisation. The industries that form his other portfolio--communications and information technology--are cases in point. The government's hands-off approach to the IT business has allowed it to become a world-beater. And in telecoms, liberalisation has sparked a boom--India is adding nearly 2m mobile-phone connections a month.
Yet even there, Mr Shourie is smarting from a setback: his failure in January to gain cabinet approval to open the telecoms sector to majority foreign ownership. He ran into resistance from a wing of his party that is suspicious of globalisation. Mr Shourie and other unelected economic liberals rely heavily on the support of the prime minister, Atal Behari Vajpayee. 
Mr Shourie hopes that the next government will continue reforming--even if Congress, the main opposition party, wins. Congress launched the reforms in government, but now often seems opposed to them. Everybody opposes reform in opposition, argues Mr Shourie, but in office, finds it the only option. The priorities now are to tackle the deficit, by cutting government subsidies, and to devise new formulae for the distribution of funds between states and the federal government. At present, non-performance is rewarded and success penalised. 
But Mr Shourie is also known for his outspoken backing of many of the ""Hindu nationalist"" issues identified with the BJP. This makes him the object of much anger from India's Muslim minority. Mr Shourie, however, claims there is convergence here, too, as any party in power will have to ""accommodate itself to the diversity of India"".

ASK most Indians and Pakistanis what is now the central issue in their two countries' relations, and the answer is simple: cricket. But Pakistan's president, General Pervez Musharraf, takes a more traditional view. The central or ""core"" issue, he insisted on March 13th, is Kashmir, the divided land claimed by both countries. Speaking by satellite to a conference in Delhi organised by India Today, a weekly magazine, this struck a jarring note. It was a reminder that a year-old peace process has made great strides in reducing tension, but none whatsoever in resolving the underlying dispute.
On March 13th in Karachi and March 16th in Rawalpindi, the two national teams played thrilling one-day cricket matches. Hundreds of millions in the two countries huddled in front of their television sets to indulge a shared national passion. This is India's first cricket tour of Pakistan since 1989, the year an insurgency in Indian-administered Kashmir broke out. It is one of a number of ""confidence-building measures"" since India's prime minister, Atal Behari Vajpayee, launched a peace initiative last May. None of the others--such as restoring full diplomatic relations, reopening direct air, road and rail links, and stepping up cultural exchanges--has had such an impact. 
There were some fears that it might actually have counter-productive effects: a terrorist attack on the Indian team, or an outbreak of communal violence in India if Pakistan were to win and some alienated members of India's Muslim minority cheered the victory. But, with the series so far tied at one-all after two closely fought games, the enthusiasm is such that one might think peace had dawned.
It has not. But the cricket does at least provide an encouraging backdrop to eight sets of planned talks between senior officials on bilateral disputes. One set is to discuss Kashmir, but, in a painstakingly wrought diplomatic formula, the issue was accorded no ""central"" role. In insisting on the point, General Musharraf, who has what Salman Haider, a former head of India's diplomatic service, calls ""a horrible habit of unexpected candour"", provoked a tetchy Indian reaction. The two sides were back to the diplomatic sniping they seemed to have renounced. 
In Kashmir, too, old habits linger. A ceasefire along the ""line of control"" between Indian and Pakistani Kashmir has been holding since November, and infiltration by Pakistan-trained militants has dried up. But until the snow melts in the high mountain passes, India will not know if this is a lasting trend. Pakistan has not dismantled the militants' training camps in its territory. Colin Powell, America's secretary of state, who visited Delhi and Islamabad this week, said he would raise the issue with General Musharraf.
Nor is there much to show for a dialogue that began in January between the Indian government and moderate Kashmiri separatists. Even before the first round, the talks had caused a split in separatist ranks. They have since subdivided again, because of complaints that expected gestures of goodwill from India--the release of detainees, an end to abuses by its soldiers, and even, perhaps, a ceasefire--have not materialised. Instead, India has succeeded in killing a number of leading militants. In return, terrorist attacks have persisted, including an attempt to murder the chief minister of the Indian state of Jammu & Kashmir. A second round of talks is still due on March 27th, but the flicker of optimism is extinguished.
This adds to the pressure on General Musharraf, criticised at home for winning no important concessions from India, to take a hard line. ""The task for Indian statesmanship,"" argues Mr Haider, ""is to let Musharraf emerge from this looking good."" Losing at cricket might help.

""A FOREGONE conclusion,"" says Pramod Mahajan, a strategist with India's Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), of the resounding victory he expects in the general election that begins on April 20th. Just what a spin doctor might be expected to say, but opinion polls and analysts all agree that the BJP is likely to emerge again as the largest party in India's parliament, and that the multi-party coalition it has led since 1998, the National Democratic Alliance, is the favourite to form the government. The biggest opposition party, Congress, is expected to remain just that.
The campaign has been, by local standards, a tame affair. Such judgments are, of course, relative. In Kashmir, where separatist militants are boycotting the polls, senior politicians narrowly escaped being among the 11 people killed by a bomb at a rally on April 8th. In Jharkhand, in the east, Maoist guerrillas killed 26 policemen with a landmine explosion on the same day. In Bihar, two days later, three workers for one political party were shot dead in two separate attacks.
But the violence has to be seen in the context of the mind-boggling scale of an Indian election. There are six ""national"" parties, dozens of regional ones, and thousands of candidates. They are vying for the favours of 670m voters, of whom, judging by the past few polls, some 60% will turn out, about ten percentage points more, for example, than in the 2000 American presidential election. There are over 700,000 polling stations, with 1,075,000 electronic voting machines. To enable officials and security forces to get to where they are needed, there will be four rounds of voting, culminating on May 10th, with the results to be announced three days later.
This is the first general election in which all voting and counting will be electronic, by pushing buttons on sturdy-looking plastic boxes the size of a computer keyboard, connected by a cable to a ""control unit"" that resembles a large desktop calculator. They appear tamper-proof--though there are worries that biased electoral officials may hoodwink voters unfamiliar with the gadgets--and promise the remarkable feat of counting all the votes in a matter of hours.
Charged with ensuring a fair election is the fiercely independent Election Commission. The politicians seem intent on finding new ways of breaking the rules. Late last month, for example, Vijai Sharma, the chief electoral officer of the northern state of Uttar Pradesh, banned an 11-tonne sweet. An activist in the state capital, Lucknow, wanted to offer the world's biggest Indian laddoo at a temple, for the good health of India's prime minister, Atal Behari Vajpayee. Since Mr Vajpayee is the local member of parliament and standing for re-election, Mr Sharma ruled that the laddoo had to be seen as part of his campaign. The electoral code bars the use of places of worship for campaigning.
The watchdogs were unable, however, to prevent an apparent exercise in vote-buying that led to a disaster. On April 12th over 20 women and children were killed at a rally in Lucknow, ostensibly to mark the birthday of a leader in Uttar Pradesh of Mr Vajpayee's BJP. They died in a stampede to secure sarees that were being handed out free of charge.
Technical default
This embarrassment for the BJP also highlights how hollow one of its main campaign themes--India's booming economy--rings for poor Indians, ready to risk their lives for an outfit costing about 45 rupees ($1). Perhaps for that reason, this has been a rather passionless campaign. There has been no big issue or event to galvanise it, as, say, in the 1991 election, at the height of the movement to build a temple to the Hindu god Ram on the site of a mosque at his supposed birthplace in Ayodhya. 
The BJP line is that the issues this time are twofold: ""feeling good"", and a ""great leader"", Mr Vajpayee. The party hopes that the voters will credit it with India's present economic growth-rate of 8% a year (fuelled, however, by a lavish monsoon in 2003), and overlook four previous years of lacklustre performance. Mr Vajpayee, though he can seem rather aloof, has a stature these days that no other Indian politician can match, and is basking in the popularity of his latest effort to make peace with Pakistan.
The BJP campaign also tries to exploit prejudice against the foreign birth (in Italy) of the Congress leader, Sonia Gandhi, widow of Rajiv Gandhi, a former prime minister. But, despite its roots in a Hindu fundamentalist movement, the BJP is playing down ""Hindu"" issues, such as the Ayodhya temple, and is fielding more Muslim candidates. It has been restrained in office by its partners in the alliance, many of whom are reluctant to alienate India's 130m-strong Muslim minority. But in another blow for the BJP's image on April 12th, the Supreme Court ordered a retrial in a murder case arising from a pogrom against Muslims in 2002 in the state of Gujarat, where the BJP-run state government is accused of complicity in the terror and of sabotaging the judicial follow-up.
Congress is campaigning as the party of India's secular traditions, as well as of the poor, especially those in the countryside, for whom the fast-growing economy is just a distant rumour. Its economic manifesto, however, offers not so much a radical change of course as a vague hope of increasing the annual growth rate to 10%. 
One Congress leader, Salman Khurshid, argues this is largely a ""technical"" election, less about policies than about forging competing alliances with smaller regional and caste-based parties across India's 28 states and seven ""union territories"", which have less autonomy. 
It is true that the next government will almost certainly be another coalition, and the count will be followed by a bout of frantic political horse-trading. The BJP hopes to improve on its showing in the last election, in 1999, when it won 182 out of 545 seats. But even Mr Mahajan says it would be ""real magic"" were it to get about 200 seats, so it will continue to rely on the National Democratic Alliance, albeit in a revamped form. 
Congress, which ruled India for most of its first half-century of independence, and is still the only truly national party, has shed its traditional aversion to ""pre-poll alliances"" and has already shared seat allocations with a strong local coalition partner in four of the six biggest states, with a total of 169 seats (Andhra Pradesh, Bihar, Maharashtra and Tamil Nadu). It hopes for more than the 112 seats it won last time. But even party strategists say the maximum it can achieve is around 135.
The anvil in the north
One reason for the modesty of this ambition is the dire outlook for Congress in Uttar Pradesh, India's largest state, with 170m people and 80 out of the 545 seats in parliament. Congress holds only nine of them, and may well lose some of those. This state is where, to a large extent, India's general elections are decided. It is home not just to Ayodhya and Mr Vajpayee's constituency. It is also where Congress's Mrs Gandhi is contesting a seat, as did her late husband and her mother-in-law, another former prime minister. For the first time, Mrs Gandhi's son, Rahul, is also standing in a family stronghold.
The state is a case study in many of the ills besetting Indian politics: not just of constituencies handed down like family heirlooms; but also of venal, sometimes thuggish and often outright criminal candidates; of parties appealing not on the basis of policies but of narrow regional or caste interests; of coalitions formed not out of like-minded ideologies but out of naked power-seeking. 
In Uttar Pradesh, there are no election issues, except, in Mr Khurshid's words, ""the one you were born to""--the state's complex web of religion- and caste-based party loyalties. Congress has fallen through the gaps. In crude terms, the state has four blocks of voters, each accounting for 20-30% of the total: Muslims; upper-caste Hindus, such as Brahmins; dalits, the group, once known as untouchables, at the bottom of the Hindu caste system; and ""other backward castes"".
Congress used to rely on the votes of upper-caste Hindus, Muslims and dalits. Many upper-caste Hindus now vote for the BJP, which has 25 seats in the state. This time, Congress dithered over its strategy in Uttar Pradesh, torn between going it alone and seeking an anti-BJP alliance, and ending up with an underprepared campaign. It failed to woo either of two possible partners: the Samajwadi, or Socialist, party, led by Uttar Pradesh's present chief minister, Mulayam Singh Yadav, with a strong support base among other backward castes and Muslims; and the Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) led by Mayawati, a former chief minister, and famous dalit champion. 
Congress's only hope in the state--and perhaps in the country as a whole--is a ""ripple effect"" from the enthusiasm that has greeted Rahul Gandhi and his sister Priyanka, who has also been campaigning. Despite their youth--both are in their early 30s--and inexperience, they have drawn big crowds: their father, grandmother and great-grandfather were all prime minister. Congress contrasts their vitality with Mr Vajpayee, who is 79. Though an old man, he gives no sign of being in a hurry. But neither, for now, do the youthful Gandhis, believing that time, as well as ancestry, is on their side.

The biggest opposition party , Congress , is expected to remain just that . 
 The campaign has been , by local standards , a tame affair . Such judgments are , of course , relative . In Kashmir , where separatist militants are boycotting the polls , senior politicians narrowly escaped being among the 11 people killed by a bomb at a rally on April 8th . In Jharkhand , in the east , Maoist guerrillas killed 26 policemen with a landmine explosion on the same day . In Bihar , two days later , three workers for one political party were shot dead in two separate attacks . 
 But the violence has to be seen in the context of the mind - boggling scale of an Indian election . There are six "" national "" parties , dozens of regional ones , and thousands of candidates . They are vying for the favours of 670 m voters , of whom , judging by the past few polls , some 60 % will turn out , about ten percentage points more , for example , than in the 2000 American presidential election . There are over 700,000 polling stations , with 1,075,000 electronic voting machines . To enable officials and security forces to get to where they are needed , there will be four rounds of voting , culminating on May 10th , with the results to be announced three days later . 
 This is the first general election in which all voting and counting will be electronic , by pushing buttons on sturdy - looking plastic boxes the size of a computer keyboard , connected by a cable to a "" control unit "" that resembles a large desktop calculator . They appear tamper - proof -- though there are worries that biased electoral officials may hoodwink voters unfamiliar with the gadgets -- and promise the remarkable feat of counting all the votes in a matter of hours . 
 Charged with ensuring a fair election is the fiercely independent Election Commission . The politicians seem intent on finding new ways of breaking the rules . Late last month , for example , Vijai Sharma , the chief electoral officer of the northern state of Uttar Pradesh , banned an 11 - tonne sweet . An activist in the state capital , Lucknow , wanted to offer the world 's biggest Indian laddoo at a temple , for the good health of India 's prime minister , Atal Behari Vajpayee . Since Mr Vajpayee is the local member of parliament and standing for re - election , Mr Sharma ruled that the laddoo had to be seen as part of his campaign . The electoral code bars the use of places of worship for campaigning . 
 The watchdogs were unable , however , to prevent an apparent exercise in vote - buying that led to a disaster . On April 12th over 20 women and children were killed at a rally in Lucknow , ostensibly to mark the birthday of a leader in Uttar Pradesh of Atal Bihari Vajpayee's . They died in a stampede to secure sarees that were being handed out free of charge . 
 Technical default 
 This embarrassment for Atal Bihari Vajpayee also highlights how hollow one of Atal Bihari Vajpayee's main campaign themes -- India 's booming economy -- rings for poor Indians , ready to risk their lives for an outfit costing about 45 rupees ( $ 1 ) . Perhaps for that reason , this has been a rather passionless campaign . There has been no big issue or event to galvanise it , as , say , in the 1991 election , at the height of the movement to build a temple to the Hindu god Ram on the site of a mosque at his supposed birthplace in Ayodhya . 
 The Atal Bihari Vajpayee line is that the issues this time are twofold : "" feeling good "" , and a "" great leader "" , Mr Vajpayee . Atal Bihari Vajpayee hopes that the voters will credit Atal Bihari Vajpayee with India 's present economic growth - rate of 8 % a year ( fuelled , however , by a lavish monsoon in 2003 ) , and overlook four previous years of lacklustre performance . Mr Vajpayee , though he can seem rather aloof , has a stature these days that no other Indian politician can match , and is basking in the popularity of his latest effort to make peace with Pakistan . 
 The Atal Bihari Vajpayee campaign also tries to exploit prejudice against the foreign birth ( in Italy ) of the Congress leader , Sonia Gandhi , widow of Rajiv Gandhi , a former prime minister . But , despite Atal Bihari Vajpayee's roots in a Hindu fundamentalist movement , Atal Bihari Vajpayee is playing down "" Hindu "" issues , such as the Ayodhya temple , and is fielding more Muslim candidates . Atal Bihari Vajpayee has been restrained in office by Atal Bihari Vajpayee's partners in Atal Bihari Vajpayee , many of whom are reluctant to alienate India 's 130m - strong Muslim minority . But in another blow for Atal Bihari Vajpayee's image on April 12th , the Supreme Court ordered a retrial in a murder case arising from a pogrom against Muslims in 2002 in the state of Gujarat , where the Atal Bihari Vajpayee - run state government is accused of complicity in the terror and of sabotaging the judicial follow - up . 
 Congress is campaigning as the party of India 's secular traditions , as well as of the poor , especially those in the countryside , for whom the fast - growing economy is just a distant rumour . Its economic manifesto , however , offers not so much a radical change of course as a vague hope of increasing the annual growth rate to 10 % . 
 One Congress leader , Salman Khurshid , argues this is largely a "" technical "" election , less about policies than about forging competing alliances with smaller regional and caste - based parties across India 's 28 states and seven "" union territories "" , which have less autonomy . 
 It is true that the next government will almost certainly be another coalition , and the count will be followed by a bout of frantic political horse - trading . Atal Bihari Vajpayee hopes to improve on Atal Bihari Vajpayee's showing in the last election , in 1999 , when Atal Bihari Vajpayee won 182 out of 545 seats . But even Mr Mahajan says it would be "" real magic "" were Atal Bihari Vajpayee to get about 200 seats , so Atal Bihari Vajpayee will continue to rely on Atal Bihari Vajpayee , albeit in a revamped form . 
 Congress , which ruled India for most of its first half - century of independence , and is still the only truly national party , has shed its traditional aversion to "" pre - poll alliances "" and has already shared seat allocations with a strong local coalition partner in four of the six biggest states , with a total of 169 seats ( Andhra Pradesh , Bihar , Maharashtra and Tamil Nadu ) . It hopes for more than the 112 seats it won last time . But even party strategists say the maximum it can achieve is around 135 . 
 The anvil in the north 
 One reason for the modesty of this ambition is the dire outlook for Congress in Uttar Pradesh , India 's largest state , with 170 m people and 80 out of the 545 seats in parliament . Congress holds only nine of them , and may well lose some of those . This state is where , to a large extent , India 's general elections are decided . It is home not just to Ayodhya and Mr Vajpayee 's constituency . It is also where Congress 's Mrs Gandhi is contesting a seat , as did her late husband and her mother - in - law , another former prime minister . For the first time , Mrs Gandhi 's son , Rahul , is also standing in a family stronghold . 
 The state is a case study in many of the ills besetting Indian politics : not just of constituencies handed down like family heirlooms ; but also of venal , sometimes thuggish and often outright criminal candidates ; of parties appealing not on the basis of policies but of narrow regional or caste interests ; of coalitions formed not out of like - minded ideologies but out of naked power - seeking . 
 In Uttar Pradesh , there are no election issues , except , in Mr Khurshid 's words , "" the one you were born to""--the state 's complex web of religion- and caste - based party loyalties . Congress has fallen through the gaps . In crude terms , the state has four blocks of voters , each accounting for 20 - 30 % of the total : Muslims ; upper - caste Hindus , such as Brahmins ; dalits , the group , once known as untouchables , at the bottom of the Hindu caste system ; and "" other backward castes "" . 
 Congress used to rely on the votes of upper - caste Hindus , Muslims and dalits . Many upper - caste Hindus now vote for Atal Bihari Vajpayee . This time , Congress dithered over its strategy in Uttar Pradesh , torn between going it alone and seeking an anti - Atal Bihari Vajpayee alliance , and ending up with an underprepared campaign . It failed to woo either of two possible partners : the Samajwadi , or Socialist , party , led by Uttar Pradesh 's present chief minister , Mulayam Singh Yadav , with a strong support base among other backward castes and Muslims ; and the Bahujan Samaj Party ( BSP ) led by Mayawati , a former chief minister , and famous dalit champion . 
 Congress 's only hope in the state -- and perhaps in the country as a whole -- is a "" ripple effect "" from the enthusiasm that has greeted Rahul Gandhi and his sister Priyanka , who has also been campaigning . Despite their youth -- both are in their early 30s -- and inexperience , they have drawn big crowds : their father , grandmother and great - grandfather were all prime minister . Congress contrasts their vitality with Mr Vajpayee , who is 79 . Though an old man , he gives no sign of being in a hurry . But neither , for now , do the youthful Gandhis , believing that time , as well as ancestry , is on their side .

The politics of business schools
INDIA'S six Institutes of Management have built international reputations in the past few years. Multinational as well as Indian companies regularly go to them for recruits, with banks like Morgan Stanley offering salaries of $100,000 or more to the best graduates from the best school, in Ahmedabad.
That would seem to be a good example of ""India Shining""-the slogan used by the government in the lengthy general election that is now taking place. Unfortunately, Murli Manohar Joshi, the human resources development minister responsible for education, does not like such elitism-nor is he very keen on foreign companies. He wants to bring the colleges down a peg or two and has been trying to force them to reduce their fees from 100,000-150,000 rupees ($2,???-$?,40?) a year to 30,000 rupees, arguing that they are beyond the reach of the poor. This would make them more dependent on government funding, and thus more susceptible to its control, and has led to a public row.
Mr Joshi, aged 70, is no stranger to controversy. He was one of the three leaders of the Bharatiyajanata Party (bjp) in the early 1990s, ranking alongside Atal Behari Vajpayee, now prime minister of the Bjp-led coalition government, and L. K. Advani, the deputy prime minister. Now rather eclipsed, he has continued to push the bjp's Hindunationalist line. He has had school textbooks re-written by relatively unknown historians sympathetic to his views and has encouraged the introduction of university courses in Vedic astrology.
Mr Vajpayee let him pursue his targets, presumably because it placated the far-right of the Sangh Parivar, the Hindu ""family of organisations"" to which the bjp belongs, at a time when the government was going slow on more controversial issues. But the management institutes are headed by influential top industrialists including Narayana Murthy, founder of Infosys, one of India's biggest it companies. Mr Murthy is chairman of the Ahmedabad institute, and has led a public attack on Mr Joshi's proposals. The row even went to the Supreme Court after Mr Joshi's ministry refused to pledge that it would not interfere with the colleges' autonomy.
This became too controversial for the government during a general election and Mr Joshi has been gently side-lined by his colleagues-even though three or four of the financially weaker and more easily pressured colleges have more-orless fallen into line. A clause was specially drafted in the bjp's manifesto pledging autonomy to ""centres of excellence"". Mr Joshi has got the message and is lying low. A settlement now looks likely after the election, with the institutes offering more scholarships and cheap loans for poorer students-and charging higher fees for their recruits.","India

THE results were still coming in as The Economist went to press on May 13th, but India's government has suffered a stunning reversal. Even the gloomiest of the exit and opinion polls had envisaged that the ruling coalition, led by the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), would lose only a couple of dozen seats, which it was expected easily to make up by wooing a few more small parties into its camp. Nobody expected the Congress party to come out on top--and that goes for Congress's own leadership. Yet this is what has happened. The Congress leader, Sonia Gandhi, relentlessly mocked by the BJP for her Italian origins, could well be the next prime minister of India--though there will be many days of horse-trading to get through first, since Congress is far from being able to form a government on its own, and will need the support of a disparate crew of left-wing and low-caste parties.
The BJP had felt sure of victory. With estimated growth in the year to March 2004 of more than 8%, a seemingly popular leader and greatly improved relations with Pakistan to boast of, its record looked hard to beat: they called it ""India Shining"". In the past year or so, after all, India has increasingly been seen abroad as having become a sort of China-in-preparation, poised to embark on the same sort of foreign-investment-led growth that has transformed that other giant.
To many Indians, though, things did not look like that. The exceptional growth in the year just ended, based in part on a favourable monsoon, followed four years of near-drought which has hit rural voters, still the great majority, hard. Peace with Pakistan is all very well, but comes far down the list of priorities for Indian villagers, below more pressing matters such as supplies of clean water and electricity. The probable cause of the BJP's calamity is a simple old-fashioned anti-incumbency vote. To that, though, one must add something else. The religious riots of 2002, in which up to 2,000 Muslims died, took place in a state, Gujarat, governed by the BJP. Although India's Supreme Court castigated Narendra Modi, the BJP's chief minister, for failing to do anything to prevent the massacre, he has never been disciplined, remains senior in the BJP's leadership and was deployed to campaign in the election. Though it projects itself as a modern, reformist party, the BJP's roots lie in Hindu fundamentalism and the worst sort of intolerance. Atal Behari Vajpayee, the BJP leader and prime minister until he resigned on May 13th, may be widely liked, but behind him lurk Mr Modi and his kind.
Is the BJP's defeat a serious setback for economic reform in India? Not necessarily. The BJP has no monopoly on reform: indeed, the party was, historically, a tardy convert to a cause first championed by Congress's late leader, Rajiv Gandhi, and put into practice by the Congress government that took power after his assassination in 1991. The strongest reason to hope that India is indeed on the path to Chinahood is the bipartisan consensus on the virtues of privatisation, deregulation and opening to the outside world.
The problem, though, is that the consensus is bipartisan, not universal. If Congress does form a government it will have to do so with the aid of various left-wing parties, including the Communists of West Bengal and Kerala, which show little enthusiasm for market economics. Still, the BJP grappled successfully with similar problems. And a big part of India's success has come from devolving power to the country's state governments. What happens at the centre is of correspondingly less importance. The main difficulty may arise not so much over reform in general as over India's budget deficit, which is out of control: a left-Congress coalition may find it hard to cut spending. But if reform is likely to slow a bit, there is unarguably one thing to be happy about, and for which the BJP deserves great credit. Relations between India and Pakistan are better than for many years. Without peace between South Asia's nuclear duo, economic reform would be pretty pointless.","A catastrophe for the ruling party need not spell the end of reform

BAD for the credibility of almost every pundit and pollster; bad for political stability; even perhaps bad for economic reform. But the outcome of India's election has been a triumph for democracy, and the ordinary voter's refusal, after being subjected to months of self-congratulatory government propaganda about ""India Shining"", to accept rhetoric over results. As The Economist went to press on May 13th, some of the 370m votes cast in the protracted three-week election were still to be counted, and the shape of the new government was yet to emerge from the political fog. But the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) had lost. The prime minister, Atal Behari Vajpayee, had visited the president and handed in his resignation.
An alliance led by the main opposition party, Congress, seemed likely to have won nearly 220 out of the 543 contested seats. The BJP-led coalition, the National Democratic Alliance (NDA), would have about 190. A ""Left Front"", dominated by the Communists, had recorded its best-ever performance, and would have more than 60 seats. Since the Left's main priority is to oust the BJP, a coalition grouped around Congress seemed the most likely new government. Congress's leader, Sonia Gandhi, the Italian-born widow of a former prime minister, has been scorned by the BJP for her foreign origins and political cackhandedness. She has, however, had the last laugh. Her party has increased its number of seats from 112 to nearly 150--a number beyond its dreams even a month ago, and probably a few seats more than the BJP won. She is now first in line for a chance to become prime minister.
The prospect of a period of political jockeying and potential instability will worry investors, who also fear that the election will be taken as a popular rejection of the liberalising reforms of the Indian economy, recently championed by the BJP. In two state-assembly elections held simultaneously, well-known reformist leaders have been ousted. 
Chandrababu Naidu, the chief minister of Andhra Pradesh, was a darling of development banks and the press for his commitment to fiscal discipline, social reform in the countryside, and, above all, information technology and e-government. He helped turn the state capital, Hyderabad, into one of India's IT hubs, but was swept out of power in a landslide. Congress's S.M. Krishna, chief minister of neighbouring Karnataka, where the software boom has not spread its benefits far beyond the capital, Bangalore, also lost and quit--so this is not just party politics.
Such is the strength in India of the ""anti-incumbency"" vote that Karnataka is in fact one of the few states where the BJP has fared well. One of its few consolations is to have established this foothold in the south, and to advance progress towards its goal of becoming, like Congress, a truly national party. A lavish monsoon last year was an important contributor to India's soaring rate of economic growth, of more than 8% this year, and to what the BJP misdiagnosed as a national ""feel-good factor"". But Andhra Pradesh and Karnataka suffered yet another year of drought. There, the shortage of water mattered far more to most voters than the latest call-centre.
Similar considerations, on a national level, weighed against the BJP itself. It has lost more than 40 of its 182 seats. Encouraged by a good showing in state elections last December, BJP strategists had persuaded Mr Vajpayee to call elections a few months early. They argued that the BJP should capitalise on the economic boom, and on the unrivalled prestige enjoyed by the prime minister himself. 
His drive to build a lasting peace with Pakistan was hugely popular; but it has weighed little with voters. Indeed, the entire ""India Shining"" campaign had little resonance for the two out of three of India's 670m voters who live in the countryside, and remember the bad years that preceded the last, abundant monsoon. Their disillusionment was reflected in what was by Indian standards a low turn-out of around 55%. Their villages have seen little improvement in roads, electricity and water supply. A quarter of India's people still live in severe poverty. 
The BJP's boosterish rhetoric backfired, and towards the end of its campaign was jettisoned in favour of a stress on the virtues of continuity and stability. 
Before the vote, the NDA lost some important members, and others have fared badly, notably the BJP's biggest ally, Mr Naidu's Telugu Desam Party (TDP) whose 29 seats in parliament have dwindled to just a handful. Another disaster hit the NDA in the southern state of Tamil Nadu, where its former member, the Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK), routed the BJP's coalition partner.
Drawn and quartered
Congress, for its part, traditionally too proud for grubby coalition politics, had this time assembled an impressive haul of allies. But parliament will be hung, and to form a government it will still need the support of the left, and perhaps of one or two other uncommitted parties, of which the biggest are Samajwadi and the Bahujan Samaj, two lower-caste based parties with their strength in India's largest state, Uttar Pradesh. Some of these potential partners may balk at supporting Mrs Gandhi as prime minister. One rumoured alternative from within Congress is Manmohan Singh, a respected former finance minister.
An unstable coalition government, relying on the support of the Communists, is unlikely to prove radical, and may be short-lived. But the presence of Mr Singh in Congress--as a senior policymaker, at any rate, if not in the top job--is one reason for guarded optimism that the election result will not mean the stalling of economic reform. It was Mr Singh who launched the opening up and liberalisation of the economy in 1991. Congress's manifesto commits it to a policy of sustaining and even accelerating current rates of economic growth. That will not be possible without more reform: cutting the fiscal deficit; continuing to foster competition; privatising more state-run enterprises.
There are other reasons for cheer. First, one of Mr Vajpayee's dreams commands consensus support and will surely still be followed: building a lasting peace with Pakistan, a project dear to Congress the last time it was in power. Second, the electoral rebuke for the BJP from rural India might intensify efforts to spread some of the alleged shine to the gloomier parts of the countryside. Properly interpreted, it should not thwart reform, but spur it.","A stunning defeat for the ruling party

They argued that the BJP should capitalise on the economic boom , and on the unrivalled prestige enjoyed by Atal Bihari Vajpayee Bihari Vajpayee . 
 Atal Bihari Vajpayee's drive to build a lasting peace with Pakistan was hugely popular ; but it has weighed little with voters . Indeed , the entire "" India Shining "" campaign had little resonance for the two out of three of India 's 670 m voters who live in the countryside , and remember the bad years that preceded the last , abundant monsoon . Their disillusionment was reflected in what was by Indian standards a low turn - out of around 55 % . Their villages have seen little improvement in roads , electricity and water supply . A quarter of India 's people still live in severe poverty . 
 The BJP 's boosterish rhetoric backfired , and towards the end of its campaign was jettisoned in favour of a stress on the virtues of continuity and stability . 
 Before the vote , the NDA lost some important members , and others have fared badly , notably the BJP 's biggest ally , Mr Naidu 's Telugu Desam Party ( TDP ) whose 29 seats in parliament have dwindled to just a handful . Another disaster hit the NDA in the southern state of Tamil Nadu , where its former member , the Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam ( DMK ) , routed the BJP 's coalition partner . 
 Drawn and quartered 
 Congress , for its part , traditionally too proud for grubby coalition politics , had this time assembled an impressive haul of allies . But parliament will be hung , and to form a government it will still need the support of the left , and perhaps of one or two other uncommitted parties , of which the biggest are Samajwadi and the Bahujan Samaj , two lower - caste based parties with their strength in India 's largest state , Uttar Pradesh . Some of these potential partners may balk at supporting Mrs Gandhi as prime minister . One rumoured alternative from within Congress is Manmohan Singh , a respected former finance minister . 
 An unstable coalition government , relying on the support of the Communists , is unlikely to prove radical , and may be short - lived . But the presence of Mr Singh in Congress -- as a senior policymaker , at any rate , if not in the top job -- is one reason for guarded optimism that the election result will not mean the stalling of economic reform . It was Mr Singh who launched the opening up and liberalisation of the economy in 1991 . Congress 's manifesto commits it to a policy of sustaining and even accelerating current rates of economic growth . That will not be possible without more reform : cutting the fiscal deficit ; continuing to foster competition ; privatising more state - run enterprises . 
 There are other reasons for cheer . First , one of Atal Bihari Vajpayee's dreams commands consensus support and will surely still be followed : building a lasting peace with Pakistan , a project dear to Congress the last time it was in power . Second , the electoral rebuke for the BJP from rural India might intensify efforts to spread some of the alleged shine to the gloomier parts of the countryside . Properly interpreted , it should not thwart reform , but spur it .",750,India,A29-8257,IN TERM,True,"The prime minister , Atal Behari Vajpayee",7,True

SINCE nobody, and certainly not Sonia Gandhi herself, imagined the Congress party would win India's election, it is hardly surprising that the past week has been, to put it mildly, confusing. But on May 19th, a week after the election result and a whole month after polling started, it at last was clear that Mrs Gandhi would not consent to be sworn in as prime minister, all attempts by the party to change her mind having failed. In her place, the new prime minister is to be Manmohan Singh, the architect of India's economic reforms in the early 1990s. He will head a coalition government that is itself in a minority in parliament. Not much else was clear as The Economist went to press: not the make-up of Mr Singh's coalition cabinet; nor the details of the common platform he will be obliged to adhere to if he is to retain the backing of India's Communist parties, on whose support he depends; nor the implications for Pakistan and peace. Little wonder that traders have been making hay, driving the Mumbai stockmarket down a panicky 11% on May 17th, then up a happier 8% the day after.
The worries relate mainly to the fate of India's economic reform under the new management. But the markets should relax a little. In 1991, when Congress last took office, it was in an almost identical position to the one it finds itself in now: short of a majority, and forced to depend on the support of Communists from outside its coalition. Then, as now, Mr Singh was the chief reformer, though the party was led by P.V. Narasimha Rao, a septuagenarian poet with, at the time, no known enthusiasm or aptitude for reform. All the same, the Rao/Singh government lasted five years, during which it smashed the ""licence raj"" that had smothered the economy in regulations and condemned it to the sluggish ""Hindu rate of growth"", a term now happily consigned to history. That government started to privatise, opened India to foreign investment and began to deregulate the country's appalling infrastructure. Over the past six years, the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) merely continued Congress's work, with plenty of backtracking along the way. By the time of this latest election, the BJP's privatisation programme was restricted to selling off minority stakes in profitable businesses to eager buyers.
This suggests that there is plenty of reason to hope for better from the new team. As for the Communists, they should be judged by what they do, not what they say. In West Bengal, where Communists run the state government, 15 state-owned enterprises are being sold off, and IT companies have been designated as ""strategic"", meaning that their workers are banned from striking. Despite dismissing Congress economic policy as no better than the Hindu nationalists of the BJP, the Communists have worked with Congress before, and should have no difficulty doing so again.
The real problem is that the Communists have chosen to remain outside a new government. Joining would have entitled them to cabinet representation and provided a chance to put some of the good ideas they have followed at state level--on local democracy, health care and literacy--into practice throughout India. The policies of these parties need not clash with reform. The proceeds of rapid privatisation could, for example, be invested in the sort of grass-roots human development that has worked so well in Kerala, where the Communists are strong. That would appeal to both sides of the coalition, and to foreign investors as well. Sadly, the Communists put local interests first (they are rivals to Congress in two key states), and so chose to stay out. But with luck, the result could be the same: bolder deregulation, combined with more attention to the 700m Indians who live in rural areas, far from call centres and cappuccino bars. This is precisely Mr Singh's philosophy: that government should remove itself from all of the things it does not do well, which means pretty much anything to do with business, and concentrate its efforts on areas where markets alone do not provide the answers.
As Mr Singh's chances waxed during the week, the Bombay exchange rapidly recovered from its fright. And well it might. Whereas the BJP were always reluctant reformers, Mr Singh is the genuine article, a man who understands better than any other leading Indian politician the scope of what still needs to be done. This needs to include plenty more privatisation, tackling taboos such as the oil companies, the national airline and the banks. The essential but delicate task of chipping away at India's mountain of inefficient subsidies--which would allow vast sums to be spent instead on improving India's physical and human infrastructure--has not even been started. Most pressing of all is the country's fiscal mess: its deficit runs at 10% of GDP and absorbs far too much of its budget. But reducing this will be tough: neither widening the tax base nor cutting spending looks easy, especially with the Communists to convince. Still, Mr Singh has performed miracles before. When he took over as finance minister in 1991, India's foreign exchange reserves had sunk to $1.2 billion, or three weeks of imports. When he left office in 1996, they stood at $18 billion, and the economy had grown by an average of 5.6% during those years, far better than before.
Politics turn sour
Ideally, Mr Singh would be able to rely on help from the BJP, which says that it wants all these things too. In reality, this is highly unlikely. For there is not much doubting that Indian politics have taken a nasty and confrontational turn. The BJP's hysterical reaction to the prospect of Mrs Gandhi's appointment has, if nothing else, revealed just what an unpleasant and xenophobic party it fundamentally is, despite the appearance of moderation in which Atal Behari Vajpayee cloaked it. It is true that in most countries a foreign-born leader would be hard to imagine. In America it would be illegal. But India's constitution explicitly permits it, and the issue had been thoroughly ventilated before the voters had their say.
Nor is Mrs Gandhi just any foreigner: she lost both her husband and her beloved mother-in-law, both prime ministers of India, to assassins. In the recent election campaign she showed herself well able to run rings around the BJP, and its boast of a ""shining"" India, in fluent Hindi. To boycott her swearing-in, as the BJP threatened, shows a contempt for the democracy that is India's proudest achievement. And it was, incidentally, a trifle odd for L.K. Advani, the BJP's leading hard-liner and the former deputy prime minister, to have been part of the boycott planned if she became prime minister. He was born in Karachi (though it was part of British India at the time).
Unfortunately, this may be only the beginning of the BJP's return to bad old ways. Already, voices within the ranks of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh, the Hindu-nationalist mass movement on which the BJP depends, are blaming the loss of the election on insufficient promotion of Hindutva, or ""Hinduness"". What does this actually mean? On past evidence, more revision of school textbooks to deny the contributions that the Muslims have made to India; more pressure to tear down mosques and replace them with temples; an end to the ""special"" autonomous status of Kashmir, for what that is worth; and ultimately, one may be sure, more blood.
Even if the rabid element in the BJP can be restrained on these points, there is reason to fear that another casualty of the election may well be the welcome detente with Pakistan that Mr Vajpayee engineered. If it is to last beyond August, when the two countries' foreign ministers are to meet, and when the status of Kashmir will need to be discussed, Pakistan needs to be given a few concessions. But if hard-liners are ascendant in the BJP it may be difficult for a minority Congress government to grant them. On the other hand, Mr Singh is a Sikh, and Sikhs occupy a special position in the subcontinent, because their religion draws on both Islam and Hinduism. That might just qualify him to make a historic breakthrough. Should Pakistan and India go back to raining abuse, or shells, on each other, the new prime minister's ambition to make this the ""Indian century"" will become very much harder to achieve.","A sequence of unexpected events has given India its most reformist prime minister ever

THE glad confident morning has passed. After the Congress party confounded expectations by winning India's election, and its leader, Sonia Gandhi, compounded the astonishment by turning down the office of prime minister, Indian politics was briefly suffused with notions of noble sacrifice and reformist idealism. Within hours, however, it was back to the murkier business of politics as usual; rewards for the loyal; sops for the proud; portfolios for the power-hungry. 
Mrs Gandhi's nominee to run the government, Manmohan Singh, is dignified and cerebral, and enjoys both a reputation for scrupulous honesty and impeccable reformist credentials. Sadly, those are not the qualities needed for forming, or running, a coalition government. Like sheepdogs corralling an unruly flock only to find that there is always one outside the pen ambling towards a cliff, Congress henchmen are already struggling to keep their new coalition, known as the United Progressive Alliance (UPA), together through its very first challenge: forming the 68-member administration.
First to bolt was Laloo Prasad Yadav, of the Rashtriya Janata Dal, the longest-standing of Congress's coalition partners, and, with 23 of parliament's 545 seats, the biggest. Mr Yadav apparently thought these virtues merited a big job, namely home minister. This would have been embarrassing: he faces a number of charges of involvement in a massive corruption scandal in his state, Bihar. Mr Yadav was placated by being made minister for railways. This, too, is an important job: Indian Railways is by some measures the world's largest commercial organisation (though it would help if passengers in places such as Bihar paid fares). Another Congress ally wanted the post and is now in a huff.
The next biggest coalition partner, the Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam, from the southern state of Tamil Nadu, then threw a tantrum because it was not given the portfolios it had been promised. Its seven ministers refused to be sworn in until this ""mistake"" was corrected, in a shuffle that saw the first appointee as shipping minister, K. Chandrashekhar Rao, stand down. Mr Rao had a price, however: a promise of help for his party's one demand, that a separate state, called Telengana, be carved out of Andhra Pradesh.
Since Congress holds only 145 seats on its own, this wrangling raises doubts about the government's stability. But Shaibal Gupta, an analyst at the Asian Development Research Institute, in Patna in Bihar, argues it is more solid than it looks. It will be held together by a fear of the return of the last government, led by the Hindu-nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party, and by the worry that in a snap election Congress might do even better at its partners' expense. Mrs Gandhi's act of renunciation is thought to be a vote-winner.
Policy differences are another worry, especially since the coalition will rely on the ""outside support"" of a 59-seat-strong Left Front, dominated by the Communists. Mr Singh is seen as the father of India's economic-reform programme ()see page 80 as finance minister in the early 1990s. That portfolio has now gone to another former incumbent, Palaniappan Chidambaram, also known as an ardent reformer. The Communists demanded changes in the UPA's ""common minimum programme"", released on May 27th, even though they are not signatories.
In two areas, the Communists have acted as a brake: radical reform of India's over-protective labour laws, a big deterrent to investment; and the privatisation of most money-making state enterprises. Congress's partners have also secured a commitment to the repeal of much-abused anti-terrorist legislation. On the whole, however, the programme reflects Congress's own agenda. It aims for annual economic growth of 7-8% through continued economic liberalisation.
The surprising strength of Congress's position can be seen in its success in holding on to the finance and three other most important portfolios. This also shows the influence of Mrs Gandhi herself. The foreign, home and defence ministers are all Gandhi-family loyalists. One of them, Shivraj Patil, the home minister, actually lost the election. He will join the prime minister and the new foreign minister, Natwar Singh, in the nominated and indirectly-elected upper house of parliament.
As well as leading Congress nationally, Mrs Gandhi leads the parliamentary party and the UPA, and there have been fears of a confusion between two ""power centres"". However, her new-found prestige and newly-recognised political skills should actually strengthen the government. Still, the fact that only two of the top five positions are held by directly elected politicians may prove a liability. It is worrying, too, that two of the five are septuagenarians, and two more are 68.
Such is Mrs Gandhi's standing that Pakistan's president, Pervez Musharraf, has invited her to visit. Both Natwar Singh and the new national-security adviser, J.N. Dixit, are former diplomats who served in Pakistan. Congress backed the peace initiative launched last year by the former prime minister, Atal Behari Vajpayee. It now has to manage a series of technical talks, leading up to a meeting between foreign ministers in August, covering all issues, including the hardest of all--Kashmir. But Congress insists on taking an agreement signed in Simla in 1972 as a starting-point. That implies legitimising the status quo in Kashmir, and is unlikely to appeal to General Musharraf, a man Natwar Singh last year described as ""a one-dimensional individual, obsessed with Kashmir"". What is needed is a victory for hope over all the bitter experience embodied in India's new foreign-policy team.","Reformist idealism confronts grubby reality

LIKE mourners bickering at a funeral, members of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) are busily apportioning blame for their surprise defeat in the elections held in India in April and May. They are also squabbling over its future direction and leadership, and over how to handle a revolt in the ranks in the state of Gujarat against the leadership of Narendra Modi, the chief minister, and most controversial of all BJP politicians.
On one side are those who think the party needs to broaden its appeal as a moderate, centrist, force. On the other are those who want the BJP to reassert its identity as the champion of India's Hindu majority. The BJP is the political branch of a ""family"" of Hindu organisations, whose parent is the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS). Many within the RSS believe that the election was lost because not enough attention was paid to the movement's core purpose, the promotion of Hindutva, or ""Hinduness"".
The former prime minister, Atal Behari Vajpayee, seen as a moderate, managed to keep these different strands together during the party's six years in government, but he is 79 and retreating from the front line. He will remain chairman of the BJP's parliamentary party and of the National Democratic Alliance, the coalition of a dozen parties it led in the outgoing government. But the formal leader of the opposition--and, as the leader of the BJP's parliamentary group, its most public face--will now be Lal Krishna Advani, who was Mr Vajpayee's deputy prime minister.
Mr Advani is trying to live down his image as a tub-thumping hardliner. In the early 1990s, he dragged the BJP from the political fringes to the verge of national power by leading a divisive campaign for the construction of a Hindu temple in Ayodhya, where a mosque then stood. He is 76 and so presumably cannot hope to be more than an interim leader. But who could succeed him? 
A number of younger politicians, jostling for prominence, have suffered setbacks. Sushma Swaraj, the outgoing health minister, became a figure of fun after promising to shave her head if Sonia Gandhi, the Italian-born leader of the ruling Congress party, became prime minister. Pramod Mahajan, a BJP general secretary, and Arun Jaitley, the former commerce minister, were seen as brilliant political strategists. Yet the BJP's election campaign, boasting of economic successes invisible to many voters, was a disaster. 
Moreover, none of these is an elected politician with a mass power base. Gujarat's Mr Modi, on the other hand, led the BJP to a landslide in state elections in 2002, and has a devoted following among hardcore BJP and RSS activists. However, he is loathed and feared by India's large Muslim minority and by liberals across the country. His government was accused of complicity in anti-Muslim riots in Gujarat in 2002, when perhaps 2,000 people were killed. Not a single murder has since led to a conviction. In April, the country's Supreme Court called Mr Modi's government ""modern-day Neros"", and accused it of having ""sympathies more for the accused than the victims"".
Nationally, although Mr Vajpayee has blamed complacency rather than Gujarat for the NDA's poor electoral showing, not all his alliance partners agree. That, however, is not why Mr Modi is in political trouble. In the parliamentary elections, the BJP's share of Gujarat's 26 seats fell from 20 to 14, and he has since faced a rebellion from 62 of the BJP's 127 members of the state assembly against what Rajendrasinh Rana, the BJP's state president, calls his ""autocratic type of functioning"". 
His problems stem in part not from alleged bigotry but from economic reformism. A powerful RSS-affiliated farmers' organisation has turned on him for raising electricity tariffs. In the past, Gujarat, like some other states, has courted bankruptcy by doling out free power. 
Many observers in Gujarat think Mr Modi is on his way out--if not imminently, then later this year after state elections in neighbouring Maharashtra. He still, however, has loyalists. S.K. Modi (no relation), his authorised biographer, thinks the BJP lost not because of its perceived extremism but its moderation--a policy of ""appeasement"" of minorities such as Muslims--that has made it indistinguishable from the Congress party. 
This, he says, has disillusioned party workers and undermined campaigning. Worse could follow: ""The whole BJP will collapse if Narendra Modi goes."" That is an exaggeration, no doubt. But it highlights the party's real dilemma, for it needs both the votes of moderates and the zeal of the extremists.

 LIKE mourners bickering at a funeral , members of the Bharatiya Janata Party ( BJP ) are busily apportioning blame for their surprise defeat in the elections held in India in April and May. They are also squabbling over its future direction and leadership , and over how to handle a revolt in the ranks in the state of Gujarat against the leadership of Narendra Modi , the chief minister , and most controversial of all BJP politicians . 
 On one side are those who think the party needs to broaden its appeal as a moderate , centrist , force . On the other are those who want the BJP to reassert its identity as the champion of India 's Hindu majority . The BJP is the political branch of a "" family "" of Hindu organisations , whose parent is the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh ( RSS ) . Many within the RSS believe that the election was lost because not enough attention was paid to the movement 's core purpose , the promotion of Hindutva , or "" Hinduness "" . 
 Atal Bihari Vajpayee , managed to keep these different strands together during the party 's six years in government , but Atal Bihari Vajpayee is 79 and retreating from the front line . Atal Bihari Vajpayee will remain chairman of the BJP 's parliamentary party and of the National Democratic Alliance , the coalition of a dozen parties it led in the outgoing government . But the formal leader of the opposition -- and , as the leader of the BJP 's parliamentary group , its most public face -- will now be Lal Krishna Advani , who was Atal Bihari Vajpayee's deputy prime minister . 
 Mr Advani is trying to live down his image as a tub - thumping hardliner . In the early 1990s , he dragged the BJP from the political fringes to the verge of national power by leading a divisive campaign for the construction of a Hindu temple in Ayodhya , where a mosque then stood . He is 76 and so presumably can not hope to be more than an interim leader . But who could succeed him ? 
 A number of younger politicians , jostling for prominence , have suffered setbacks . Sushma Swaraj , the outgoing health minister , became a figure of fun after promising to shave her head if Sonia Gandhi , the Italian - born leader of the ruling Congress party , became prime minister . Pramod Mahajan , a BJP general secretary , and Arun Jaitley , the former commerce minister , were seen as brilliant political strategists . Yet the BJP 's election campaign , boasting of economic successes invisible to many voters , was a disaster . 
 Moreover , none of these is an elected politician with a mass power base . Gujarat 's Mr Modi , on the other hand , led the BJP to a landslide in state elections in 2002 , and has a devoted following among hardcore BJP and RSS activists . However , he is loathed and feared by India 's large Muslim minority and by liberals across the country . His government was accused of complicity in anti - Muslim riots in Gujarat in 2002 , when perhaps 2,000 people were killed . Not a single murder has since led to a conviction . In April , the country 's Supreme Court called Mr Modi 's government "" modern - day Neros "" , and accused it of having "" sympathies more for the accused than the victims "" . 
 Nationally , although Atal Bihari Vajpayee has blamed complacency rather than Gujarat for the NDA 's poor electoral showing , not all Atal Bihari Vajpayee's alliance partners agree . That , however , is not why Mr Modi is in political trouble . In the parliamentary elections , the BJP 's share of Gujarat 's 26 seats fell from 20 to 14 , and he has since faced a rebellion from 62 of the BJP 's 127 members of the state assembly against what Rajendrasinh Rana , the BJP 's state president , calls his "" autocratic type of functioning "" .

CHANGING partners is never entirely easy. The peace process between India and Pakistan has endured something of a rocky patch since its principal architect, Atal Behari Vajpayee, India's former prime minister, lost an election last month. A flurry of meetings with the new Congress-party led government has now reassured Pakistan that India remains committed to the path of dialogue. What remains in doubt is whether that path actually leads anywhere.
On June 20th, officials from the two countries produced a joint statement on measures to build confidence over their respective nuclear arsenals. This was part of a series of talks agreed to in February, covering all bilateral disputes, including the intertwined issues of terrorism and Kashmir, which seemed to bring the neighbours to the brink of war in 2002. 
The day after the talks, India's new foreign minister, Natwar Singh, and his Pakistani counterpart, Khurshid Kasuri, had a chummy lunch on the margins of a regional conference in Qingdao, China. Progress was also being made in talks about a contentious hydro-electric project in Indian-administered Kashmir. On June 27th, the heads of the countries' diplomatic services are to meet and broach the subject of Kashmir. The foreign ministers will meet again next month at another conference, and then, in August, sit down for serious bilateral talks to review progress so far.
In opposition, the Congress party last year supported Mr Vajpayee's offer of the ""hand of friendship"" to Pakistan. Pakistani officials were at first nonetheless suspicious of the new government's foreign-policy team. It is dominated by crusty former diplomats, such as Mr Singh himself, who rattled Pakistan by making repeated references to the 1972 Simla agreement between the two countries. In Islamabad, this was taken to mean that India ruled out any change in its policy on Kashmir. 
Mr Singh has since backed down, or, as his officials prefer it, cleared up the misunderstanding caused by inaccurate reporting of his remarks. After initial misgivings, says Khalid Mahmud of the Institute of Regional Studies, a think-tank in Islamabad, Pakistan has now concluded that Congress may actually prove to be a more consistent partner than was the whimsical Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) with its occasional warmongering.
So the marked improvement in relations seen in the final months of the BJP government persists. The problem is that little concrete has been achieved so far. The risk-reduction agreement covering nuclear weapons is welcomed by foreign governments worried about the risks of nuclear accidents, or of the rapid escalation of a conventional war. But it is largely symbolic. With the exception of an agreement to set up a new telephone hotline between the two foreign ministries (in itself only of symbolic value), it mostly formalises existing practice. This includes a moratorium on further nuclear explosions, and arrangements for one side notifying the other of missile tests. 
Such confidence-building measures will not satisfy Pakistan for long if there continues to be little sign that India is prepared to talk seriously about Kashmir. And, despite weariness with the 15-year long war, the moderate separatists in Kashmir itself, who are prepared at present to talk to India, may also lose patience. 
India acknowledges that far fewer militants are infiltrating Indian-controlled Kashmir, but claims that 4,000 are camped on the Pakistani side ready to cross, now the snows have melted. Even without them, the violence continues. According to India's own figures, 1,000 people were killed in the first five months of the year. The risks taken by moderates were highlighted on May 29th by the killing in a mosque in Srinagar, the state's summer capital, of Mushtaq Ahmed. He was cousin and close adviser to Umar Farooq, a senior cleric and part of a group of separatist leaders who have been engaged in talks with the Delhi government.
That dialogue, started in January, has been stalled because of the elections. India's home minister, Shivraj Patil, has acknowledged that India needs to reward separatists prepared to talk peace. But the government will not want to lay itself open to charges of being soft on terrorism. Already, the BJP has attacked this aspect of its policy. At its national-executive meeting this week in Mumbai, the moderate Mr Vajpayee hinted at retirement, while hardliners reasserted the party's Hindu-nationalist roots. That means promoting ""Hindutva"" or ""Hinduness"". It also usually means bashing Pakistan.

AMONG the mementoes Natwar Singh, India's foreign minister, shows visitors is a photograph taken in Beijing in 1957. It captures him as a young diplomat, alongside Mao Zedong and other Chinese leaders. It is a souvenir of a lost era of third-world solidarity, when India and China devised and embraced their ""five principles of peaceful coexistence"", whose 50th anniversary was celebrated in June. In 1962 they flouted them all by fighting a brief, bloody border war. China routed India, which has sulked ever since. Relations may now be on the point of recovery, though the ""brotherhood"" the giant Asian neighbours asserted in the 1950s remains a distant memory.
In Delhi this week, J.N. Dixit, India's national-security advisor, and Dai Bingguo, a Chinese deputy foreign minister, held two days of talks on the border dispute. Such discussions have a history dating back to 1981. A joint working group on the issue was formed in 1988. It made little progress, but allowed relations to improve in other ways. Last year Atal Behari Vajpayee, then India's prime minister, visited China and gave the talks new momentum. They were elevated from an exercise in cartographic quarrelling by officials to a ""political dialogue"", intended, presumably, to reach a conclusion. This is the third round, but the first since India's new government, led by the Congress party, took office in May.
There was no breakthrough, but China has been reassured that the new government wants to continue a steady improvement in ties. This has been led by business. Just a couple of years ago, Indian firms were fretting about losing market share to China. Now many see opportunities as well as threats. In the first five months of this year, Indian exports to China more than doubled compared with the same period last year, to $3.6 billion, while imports from China grew by more than half, to $1.9 billion. C. Raja Mohan, an analyst at Delhi's Jawarhalal Nehru University, sees vast potential as relations develop. Calcutta (now Kolkata), he points out, was once the port for Lhasa, capital of Tibet.
Regional and global politics also favour closer ties. Both countries, though keen to pursue better relations with America, are wary of its global dominance. China has moderated its traditional backing for Pakistan and its claim on Kashmir. Indeed, China has been exasperated by Pakistani provocations in Kashmir in recent years, and by the Islamic militants who sneak from Pakistan to its own Muslim-dominated western region of Xinjiang.
The outlines of a border deal have been clear for decades. India would cede its claim to an area of Ladakh in Kashmir, almost the size of Switzerland, occupied by China and of strategic importance to it. In return, China would accept Indian sovereignty over an area nearly three times larger, the state of Arunachal Pradesh. In each sector, some adjustments would be made. This would help spare India's blushes at a settlement it fought to thwart, and let China say it had not accepted a border imposed by British imperialists. 
India, a raucous democracy, would have more trouble selling such a trade-off at home. In the military and intelligence establishments some are still thankful for the God-given barrier formed by the Himalayas. They see China as intent on the ""strategic encirclement"" of India through its neighbours, from Pakistan round to Sri Lanka. If India's political opposition, despite Mr Vajpayee's personal stake in relations with China, decides to play the patriotic card, Mr Dixit and Mr Dai may find it more convenient to keep on meeting amicably than to reach agreement.","The principle of peaceful coexistence : keep talking as long as possible

THE scar left by the pogrom directed at the Muslim minority in the Indian state of Gujarat in February and March 2002 has yet to heal. That is partly because not a single murderer has been convicted, although perhaps 2,000 people died. The state government is under pressure from local activists, human-rights groups and India's staunchly interventionist Supreme Court to see that justice is at last done. But it continues to act less like a scourge of illegal violence than its sponsor.
This week, the Supreme Court rebuked the state government's prosecutor for his failure to secure the arrest of ten of 21 Hindus accused in an infamous court case arising from the violence: the burning to death of 14 Muslims in a bakery. The accused have already been acquitted once, after witnesses withdrew their evidence. Prosecutors appealed, but in April the Supreme Court ruled that a fair retrial was impossible in Gujarat and moved the case to the neighbouring state of Maharashtra.
The state government may have reasons for subverting the judicial process. Led by Narendra Modi, a charismatic but demagogic hardliner from the Hindu-Nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), it is accused of having done little to prevent the slaughter. Many think it was complicit.
The government has, however, acted against those accused of the horrific ""crime"" that sparked the carnage. Using the controversial Prevention of Terrorism Act (POTA), it has charged 123 Muslims and detained nearly 100 over a fire in a train compartment, which took place in the town of Godhra. Of the 58 people asphyxiated or burned to death, many were Hindu devotees, returning from a gathering at the contested site of a temple in the holy town of Ayodhya. A Muslim mob was alleged to have doused the carriage with petrol, ignited it and locked the doors. 
Revenge for this massacre was the BJP's explanation for the slaughter that followed. Even Atal Behari Vajpayee, the BJP's leader and, at the time, prime minister, seen as a moderate, asked ""Who lit the fire first?"". That foreigners and the liberal English-language press in Delhi largely ignored the Godhra massacre, concentrating on the killings of Muslims--some 9-10% of Gujarat's 50m population--heightened the sense of grievance. It helped Mr Modi lead the BJP to a landslide victory in state elections in December 2002.
Yet forensic analysis and eyewitnesses have cast doubt on the government's theory of a preplanned arson attack. A hideous accident seems more likely. Last month, the railway minister in the government that came to power in Delhi in May, Laloo Prasad Yadav, announced an enquiry into the Godhra incident. 
Mr Modi's critics were encouraged by the BJP's surprise defeat in the general elections and by its relatively poor showing in Gujarat itself, which they like to interpret as a repudiation of the BJP's communal politics. Local human-rights and social-welfare groups have had a renewed burst of energy, compiling lists of demands of the new central government led by the Congress party. The government this week agreed to one, revoking POTA, but not, as petitioners had hoped, with retrospective effect. 
Harsh Mander, an activist and writer, says that if the government fails to do more it risks ""missing a moment in history"", when it has a chance ""to make amends for past injustices"". It may already be too late, however, to rebuild trust between Hindus and Muslims. The killing accelerated their segregation--a process, says Hanif Lakdawala, a prominent social worker, that is now 90% complete. 
An example is the expanding ghetto behind the Bombay Hotel in Ahmedabad, Gujarat's main city. A warren of crude redbrick houses--much of it, during the present monsoon, under water--it is now home to some 4,000 Muslim families, mostly fugitives from the 2002 violence.
One of them, Yusuf, drives an autorickshaw, a three-wheel taxi. He is still too scared to return to his old home. Just last month, depositing passengers in a Hindu district, he was recognised as a Muslim and locals threw stones at him. Two weeks ago, fresh clashes erupted in Veraval, 320km (200 miles) south-west of Ahmedabad. But in the Bombay Hotel settlement, surrounded by 4km in either direction of exclusively Muslim slum, he feels safe. Muslims complain of a tacit economic boycott; employers put job applications bearing Muslim names to one side. In response, conservative Muslim organisations are gaining influence.
Communal relations in Gujarat raise concerns far beyond the state. This month, India's film censors refused a certificate to ""Final Solution"", a documentary on the 2002 pogrom and its aftermath, which has won prizes at film festivals from Berlin to Zanzibar. The censors accused the film of promoting ""communal disharmony"". Its maker, Rakesh Sharma, says they have become politically partisan.
The BJP itself has been in some disarray since its election defeat. Some members partly blame the setback on the stigma of the Gujarat pogrom. But the BJP's more fervent supporters--who idolise Mr Modi--accuse the party of having compromised its core ""Hindu"" principles to court moderate support. In Gujarat itself, Mr Modi has survived, for now, a rebellion from within the local party. His job was in jeopardy not because of his hardline views but because his high-handed manner has alienated many state legislators. For this reason, many in Ahmedabad still expect him to go later this year. The debate in the BJP over how to assess his rule, however, will go on much longer. So, sadly, will its effects on Gujarat's communal relations.","Truth and justice, like reconciliation, prove elusive in Gujarat

THE calendar of the world's biggest democracy is merciless. Just four months after finding itself--to universal astonishment, including its own--leading a national coalition government, India's Congress party faces another big election. On October 13th, Maharashtra, the country's richest and second most-populous state, goes to the polls. Congress officials are keen to portray the close-fought contest, where a state-level Congress-led coalition risks defeat, as a local one. Yet they also hope that the popularity of their leader, Sonia Gandhi, and of Manmohan Singh, in whose favour she renounced the prime minister's office, will win votes.
The personal standing of Mrs Gandhi and Mr Singh has not, however, afforded the government a honeymoon. Instead, from the day it took office it was beset by doubts: about how the two would share power and manage a disparate coalition; and about whether policymaking would be crippled by the need to retain the support, from outside the formal coalition, of the two Communist parties on which it relies for a parliamentary majority.
Although the stockmarket was quick to overcome its initial panic at the Communists' pivotal role (see chart), this last question has nagged most tenaciously. Far from behaving like a faithful poodle, grateful for a basket near the seat of power, the Communists have snapped terrier-like at the government's heels. Sitaram Yechury, of the bigger of the two Communist parties, even gave warning that the left's bite might be ""worse than its bark"". He says that the government, not the left, has picked all the fights. But all the squabbles revolve around the left's objections to the economic reforms with which Mr Singh and his team are identified. If they are heeded, policy may well be paralysed. 
The contentious issues are more than symbolic. They include privatising airports, raising the cap on foreign investment in the insurance and telecommunications industries and cutting the subsidised interest rates paid to pensioners through a provident fund. This week a new tiff blew up, over the government's intention to abolish a big irritant to potential foreign investors: a rule that gives Indian firms a veto over their foreign joint-venture partners' expansion plans.
The most perplexing storm, however, has been in the teacup of the Planning Commission. It wanted to appoint a few representatives of non-Indian bodies, like the World Bank and McKinsey, a consultancy, to consultative committees assessing the present five-year plan. The left snapped angrily. Mr Yechury says the dispute was not about ideology but the loss of sovereignty implied in inviting foreign entities on to government committees.
Senior Congress officials, however, see the complaints as an attempt by the left to appease the anti-reform instincts of many Communist party workers. A particular target is Montek Ahluwalia, the commission's boss. More than anyone, Mr Ahluwalia, who returned from a senior job at the IMF to join the government, is identified with economic liberalisation. Some Congress officials now question his political wisdom: why take on the left in a pointless battle? The end he sought has now been achieved simply by dissolving the committees, leaving the commission free to talk to everybody.
Congress leaders, however, insist that the Communists are still all bark and no bite. They point to the gulf between the ideologues in Delhi and the reformist Communist government in West Bengal, which mounts roadshows to attract foreign investment, and is closing down loss-making state enterprises. Jairam Ramesh, Congress's chief economic adviser, argues that ""when push comes to shove"", the left will not block some of the biggest planned reforms. Indeed, West Bengal has taken a lead in pushing for one of them: the introduction, at the fourth attempt, of a nationwide value-added tax next April.
This is the first national coalition government Congress has led, and it is not surprising there are teething troubles, especially since Congress is ""cohabiting"" with parties that are its biggest rivals in some states. The Communists and some coalition members need to pander to their constituencies with populist anti-reform rhetoric. But those same constituencies would be aghast if they were to bring about the fall of the government and the restoration of one led by the main opposition Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP). 
For this reason Kamal Nath, the commerce minister, claims that there could be no ""better-bonded"" coalition. It is true it is stronger than it sometimes looks, and stockmarket investors seem to have decided it will be able to deliver decisive policy, including some economic reform. But it has yet to prove that it has the strength to deliver the radical policies and reforms it has promised, as well as merely survive.
At least the division of labour between Mrs Gandhi and Mr Singh--she does the politics while he handles policy--seems to work. There may have been some quiet glee among those close to Mrs Gandhi at the discomfiture of Mr Ahluwalia, one of the prime minister's closest advisers. But, as yet, factional feuding is low-key.
Mr Ramesh argues that the Maharashtra election matters less for Congress than it does for the BJP. Victory would be a big boost, since the state capital Mumbai is India's financial centre and power there gives a fund-raising edge, but Congress could dismiss defeat as the usual anti-incumbent backlash. The BJP, however, is split by a tussle for the succession to its septuagenarian leaders, Atal Behari Vajpayee and L.K. Advani. It needs to win to stem a rapid slide in its fortunes; but victory will not end its internal struggles.","How well is Mahmohan Singh's new coalition government doing?

BEFORE India's general election in April and May, pundits were asking whether the Congress party, then in opposition, was in terminal decline. After its unforeseen victory was repeated on October 13th in an election in the state of Maharashtra, some of the very same pundits are asking the very same question about its main rival for national power, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP).
This was an election that, by the normal rules of Indian politics, the BJP and its local ally, Shiv Sena, should have won. Few governments, if any, are able to make much of a dent in the miserable poverty endured by most Indians, even in Maharashtra, the country's wealthiest state, so incumbency is a disadvantage. In Maharashtra, even Congress leaders admitted that the coalition government the party led there had performed badly. 
Yet the Congress alliance won 141 of the 288 seats, compared with 117 for the BJP and Shiv Sena. For Shiv Sena, which has a vile record of demagoguery and anti-Muslim thuggery, this was a serious setback. The party's rabble-rouser-in-chief, Bal Thackeray, is in poor health and could not campaign. His son and nephew are competing for the succession. Optimists interpret this year's elections as showing that the old message of communal hatred is losing impact in favour of the Indian trinity of livelihood issues--roads, water and electricity.
The BJP, too, is a Hindu-nationalist party, but is increasingly split between moderates, who want it to broaden its appeal, and advocates of sticking close to Hindutva, the party's original Hindu ideology. A few hardliners have already quit, seeking to revive the Jan Sangh, a party from which the BJP is itself descended. The Jan Sangh's Prafull Goradia accuses the BJP of ""giving up its reason for existence"".
Defeat in Maharashtra has now dented the illusion the BJP has clung to since the general election: that the Congress-led coalition would speedily collapse. It has also uncovered the bitterness of the power struggle among its second-rung leaders, those waiting to take over from Atal Behari Vajpayee, prime minister until May, and his deputy, Lal Krishna Advani. Both men are in their late 70s and, surely, unlikely to lead the party into the next election if the present government lasts anything like its full five-year term.
After the Maharashtra result, the party's president, Venkaiah Naidu, resigned. But as Rajdeep Sardesai, of NDTV, a television news channel, cuttingly put it, the old order changeth, yielding place to the older. Mr Advani, the party's battle-hardened war-horse, who led its rapid march to national prominence in the early 1990s, saddled up again, for his third stint as president.
Congress's glee at its main rival's disarray was tempered by troubles of its own. It won fewer seats in Maharashtra than did its coalition partner, the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP), led by Sharad Pawar, the agriculture minister in the central coalition. The two parties then squabbled bitterly about who should lead the new state government. 
The NCP was formed as a breakaway from Congress in 1999 in protest at the ""dynastic and authoritarian"" appointment of Sonia Gandhi, who was born in Italy, as its leader--a post that Mr Pawar had coveted. Some analysts, pointing to Mr Pawar's hostile past relations with Congress, foresee troubles ahead at the centre, as smaller parties, such as his, dream of a ""third front"" coalition without either of the two big parties. For now that is more of an arithmetic possibility than a real threat. That some see it as more of a danger than the BJP is a measure of how fast that party's fortunes have fallen.

LIKE his predecessor, Atal Behari Vajpayee, India's prime minister, Manmohan Singh, came to Kashmir bearing gifts and a message of peace. He spoke on November 17th to a bused-in crowd behind the same bullet-proof glass in the same cricket stadium in the capital, Srinagar, where 19 months earlier Mr Vajpayee had extended ""the hand of friendship"" to Pakistan. Mr Singh tried something no less ambitious: to make friends with the Kashmiris themselves. Their reaction was churlish. But in the chilly autumn sun, prospects for peace seemed brighter than they dreamed possible when Mr Vajpayee spoke through April drizzle.
War was not far away, however. Before Mr Singh's speech Indian soldiers had had a three-hour shoot-out with two militants. They had somehow managed to hide themselves in a derelict building overlooking the stadium. Tens of thousands of Indian soldiers, Kashmiri and foreign militants and civilians have died in 15 years of insurgency against Indian rule.
Mr Singh had delivered his most important gifts in advance. A few days earlier, he had announced that India would withdraw some of its troops from Kashmir. This was the first such public promise from India since the uprising began. There are an estimated 500,000 soldiers, paramilitary forces and police in Kashmir, and the withdrawal may yet turn out to be small and symbolic. But even some separatists admitted it was an important symbol.
Also sparking some Kashmiri hopes, Mr Singh's government had said it would be prepared to consider new proposals for resolving the 57-year dispute with Pakistan over Kashmir if they were formally tabled. This may happen on November 23rd, when Pakistan's prime minister, Shaukat Aziz, will be in Delhi. His boss, General Pervez Musharraf, last month floated some vague but radical-sounding ideas, perhaps heralding big concessions.
The government probably hoped these positive signals would distract Kashmiris from protests over the latest alleged atrocity by Indian forces: the rape of a woman and her ten-year old daughter. It may also have hoped to persuade moderate separatist leaders to meet Mr Singh during his visit. The separatists, however, refused, demanding that the government first allow them to visit Pakistan to talk to militant leaders there. In his speech, Mr Singh made a moving appeal for unconditional dialogue, but did not yield to this demand. 
For some Kashmiris, that was one of several disappointments. They had hoped for other political concessions, such as the release of detainees, or even a unilateral ceasefire from Indian forces. Instead, they heard a promise of massive central-government economic aid and a ""new beginning"" for the territory. Mr Singh ruled out any redrawing of international borders, or anything which smacks of a further division of India along religious lines. 
Yet even separatists such as Umar Farooq, spiritual leader of the Kashmir valley's Sunni Muslims, accept that Mr Singh is a ""decent fellow"", and that there are some grounds for optimism. It was always unrealistic for Kashmiris to expect Mr Singh to come with dramatic political concessions. But the prime minister's advisers were equally over-optimistic if they expected Kashmiris to think much of Mr Singh's undoubtedly sincere pledge of ""peace with dignity"".","India should know better than to expect Kashmiri gratitude

 THEY sounded desperate, and maybe were, but they were right. In the days before the first round of Hungary's parliamentary elections on April 7th, the ex-communist Socialist Party insisted that the opinion polls were wrong. The polls showed Fidesz, the conservative party of the prime minister, Viktor Orban, at least four points-- some said 11--in the lead. Tosh, said the Socialists: the nastiness of the campaign was simply preventing their supporters from declaring themselves.
 Unconcerned, Mr Orban urged his supporters to turn out: this first round could win it for him, he said. It allocates seats in those of the 176 individual constituencies where a candidate wins over 50%. It also decides some of the 210 regional and party-list seats. It duly did--and as voting day closed, the Socialists, in a record turnout of 70%, were ahead. They took 42% of the party-list votes, against 41% for Fidesz, 25 constituency seats against 20, and 69 regional-list seats against Fidesz's 67.
 Fidesz's position is worse than it looks. In 1998, it was behind in the first round. But Mr Orban could turn for help to a number of allies, including the agrarian Smallholders' Party and the conservative Hungarian Democratic Forum. The three parties withdrew various candidates in the second round to make way for each other, securing a centre-right majority. But since then Mr Orban has been busy uniting the right, and this time there are few Smallholders and no Democratic Forum to turn to. The Smallholders collapsed last year amid corruption scandals, and this time took less than 1% of the vote. The Democratic Forum had been absorbed into a joint election list with Fidesz. And Mr Orban's only other hope, the nationalist Hungarian Justice and Life Party, narrowly fell short of the 5% needed to get any seats at all.
 The Socialists and their would-be prime minister, Peter Medgyessy, are better placed than it looks. They lead in 75 of the 131 seats to be decided in the second round, on April 21st. And they are on good terms with the liberal Free Democrats, who took third place in 103 constituencies. The two parties on Wednesday agreed not to fight each other on April 21st: the liberals will withdraw 71 candidates, the Socialists seven. The two are likely to form a coalition after the election, as in 1994.
 The game is not yet up for Mr Orban. Characteristically, he came out fighting on Tuesday evening. Pointing to a sharp rise in the Budapest stock exchange following his party's setback, he said it showed Hungary would be dominated by foreign capital if the Socialists won. The 1994-98 Socialist-led government was indeed more free-market-minded than his has been.
 But it will be an uphill struggle for him, thanks partly to errors of his own. For much of his time in office, Mr Orban has fought the liberal mayor of Budapest and appeared to have a grudge against the city. Its voters, nearly a fifth of the electorate, turned out to vote in even higher numbers than elsewhere. And only 32% voted his way, against 42% for the Socialists.","  Behind in the first - round ballot , the ruling party looks set to lose

 France suffered a political earthquake in the first round of the presidential election: standing on a law-and-order and anti- immigrant platform, Jean-Marie Le Pen, leader of the populist National Front, took almost 17% of the vote and came second to the centre-right's Jacques Chirac.

While its leaders pledged support to Mr Chirac, the left raged in impotent street demos, French-resident Arabs shivered and most of Europe expressed horror. One near- certainty: re-election for Mr Chirac.

 IT LOST, but, even in losing, Fidesz, the conservative party of Hungary's prime minister, Viktor Orban, proved that in Central Europe too nationalist populism pays.
 Before the first round of the elections, on April 7th, the then opposition Socialists said polls were understating their support. Albeit narrowly, a surprise success proved them right: they got more votes than Fidesz, and won more of those seats decided in that round. Before the second one, on April 21st, Fidesz in turn insisted it could bring out enough extra voters to turn the overall result around. Since turnout in the first round had been a record 71%, and details of the figures looked unfavourable, that sounded even more unlikely. Yet turnout on the 21st was 73.5%, and Fidesz managed to end with 189 seats, only five short of a majority in the 386-seat parliament.
 How was it done? In the first round, the voters seemed to have rejected extremism. The Socialists, despite their unpleasant Communist heritage, are now quite like modern European social democrats. Fidesz is to the right of most centre-right parties. And the radical nationalist Hungarian Justice and Life Party did not reach the 5% needed to get any seats at all. So did Fidesz, between the rounds, aim for the centre?
 No, it became more populist and nationalistic. It held big, flag- waving rallies--one attracted several hundred thousand people--and told them that the free-market-minded Socialists would hand Hungary over to big business and (this for the farmers) let foreigners buy their land.
 The result revealed a divided country. The well-off west--well- off, ironically, thanks to foreign investment--favoured Fidesz. The poorer and less populous east mainly voted Socialist. Budapest, home to a fifth of the population, gave Fidesz only four of the city's 32 individual constituencies, and those by narrow margins.
 Peter Medgyessy, the Socialists' prime-ministerial candidate, a former finance minister with experience as an economist and banker, will depend on the support of the liberal Free Democrats, the only other party to have passed the 5% threshold. The two parties co- operated between the first round and the second, to maximise their seats, and on April 22nd began talks on a coalition, as in 1994-98.
 Even before the second round, the two parties were talking about healing the nation's divisions. They may manage a bit of that in parliament. Fidesz's electoral list included a second party, the Hungarian Democratic Forum. This latter, more like a typical Christian Democrat party, had shared in power, but in opposition its now 24 members may break away and be readier to ease the new government's path.
 Even so, Hungary looks set for four years of a government with a majority of only eight. And Fidesz will harry Mr Medgyessy-- especially if, as some Socialists have promised, the new government investigates corruption under the old one.

Budapest , home to a fifth of the population , gave Fidesz only four of the city 's 32 individual constituencies , and those by narrow margins . 
  Peter Medgyessy's will depend on the support of the liberal Free Democrats , the only other party to have passed the 5 % threshold . The two parties co- operated between the first round and the second , to maximise their seats , and on April 22nd began talks on a coalition , as in 1994 - 98 . 
  Even before the second round , the two parties were talking about healing the nation 's divisions . They may manage a bit of that in parliament . Fidesz 's electoral list included a second party , the Hungarian Democratic Forum . This latter , more like a typical Christian Democrat party , had shared in power , but in opposition its now 24 members may break away and be readier to ease the new government 's path . 
  Even so , Hungary looks set for four years of a government with a majority of only eight . And Fidesz will harry Peter Medgyessy especially if , as some Socialists have promised , the new government investigates corruption under the old one .

 A NEW slogan has appeared on walls in Budapest since Viktor Orban's conservative party, Fidesz, lost Hungary's general elections on April 21st: Csaltak (They cheated). It marks a remarkable change in Hungarian politics: Mr Orban is turning the right into a mass movement.
 The graffito reflects one of its basic premises: that the right lost the elections because the Socialists and Free Democrats, then in opposition, rigged them. Just how is unclear: electoral fraud is usually the prerogative of governments. No matter, Mr Orban, unabashed, is backing a referendum initiative aimed at preserving ballot papers so that they can be recounted. Not that he doubts the government's legitimacy, he says carefully; it is simply that, with the margins so narrow, the people should know the truth about the figures.
 Having launched his swing to populism as soon as it became clear he had lost the first round of voting, on April 7th, he has kept the momentum going. He promises to hold regular mass rallies of a new, multi-party, right-wing movement, which he is calling Hajra, Magyarorszag! (Forward, Hungary!), a deliberate echo of Forza Italia! (Go, Italy!), the football cheer that Silvio Berlusconi picked for the name of his political party, which now runs Italy. Mr Orban drew a huge crowd to Buda's castle district on May 7th for a rally where he announced the formation of what he called ""civic circles"", a bit like communist cells of old, to enable his supporters to mobilise at short notice.
 How different from the Socialist Party and its Free Democrat colleagues, now in office under Peter Medgyessy, a far less colourful figure, since May 27th. Mr Orban's team was full of zealots; his rival's is full of technicians, many of them former communists, with little political savvy. Mr Medgyessy was deputy prime minister in the 1988-89 transitional government and finance minister for part of the 1994-98 Socialist-led one, but he is a banker by profession, not a politician. He is still not a member of the Socialist Party.
 His response to Mr Orban's populism has been to set new rules to ensure greater accountability. The Socialists have also started airing allegations of crookery under the previous regime, including the controversial sale of 12 state farms and some fat government publicity contracts won by a company close to Fidesz.
 But blame-casting will not clear up public finance. Thanks to a pre- and post-election spending spree by Mr Orban's government, the budget deficit hit four-fifths of the projected figure for all of this year by the end of May. To match Fidesz's propaganda, the Socialists themselves pledged $750m in new spending in their first 100 days. The finance ministry, under Csaba Laszlo, once a civil servant there, says it can find the money. But there may well (and should) be hard choices to be made between Mr Medgyessy's promises and both men's prudent instincts.","  Voted out of power , the right accuses the left of rigging the election .

Policy over immigration into the European Union was expected to top the agenda at a summit of EU leaders gathering in the Spanish city of Seville on June 21st and 22nd. The European Commission's president, Romano Prodi, suggested that there should be a smaller inner cabinet of commissioners in order to cope with a bigger EU, which could embrace as many as 25 countries in 2004.

AN OFTEN-MENTIONED fault of Peter Medgyessy, Hungary's new prime minister, was that he was boring. No longer. This week, he was pushed to the brink of resignation after being forced to admit that he had worked for five years as an agent of Hungary's communist-era counter-intelligence service. Even in Hungary's turbulent history, it would have been a brief stint at the top. Mr Medgyessy, an economist and former banker, took office only on May 27th.
The news about his past particularly rattled the Free Democrats, a small liberal party which governs in coalition with his Socialists. As former dissidents, most of the Free Democrats' MPs have bleak memories of the various intelligence services. They were very unhappy to have the prime minister's past suddenly aired in front-page articles in Magyar Nemzet, a right-wing newspaper close to Viktor Orban's recently-ousted centre-right government. The new government relies on the Free Democrats' 20 votes for its 10-seat majority.
At least for the moment, nevertheless, the prime minister has slipped off the hook. He started his bid for survival by throwing the Free Democrats something they have long wanted by proposing a new law to ensure that counter-intelligence-agency files will be treated in the same way as other Hungarian communist-era secret-police files. They will be kept separately, in the Institute of History, and not left in the hands of the existing intelligence services. The institute will, in theory, be more open about revealing politicians' pasts. 
Mr Medgyessy denied some of the allegations against him while seeking to put those he admitted in a less ugly light. Certainly, he said, he had worked as a counter-intelligence agent in Hungary's finance ministry from 1977 to 1982. But he had merely protected Hungary's economic secrets from foreign spies and prevented them from spiking Hungary's attempts to join the IMF. Patriotic stuff, really. The countries trying to steal Hungary's economic secrets in those days, his friends explained, would have been other communist countries, such as East Germany. The Russians wanted to stop Hungary from joining the IMF, though it did so in 1982. 
The prime minister fiercely denies, however, that he did anything worse. He has said he will sue Magyar Nemzet over stories suggesting he wrote sneaky reports for the intelligence services on his friends in 1961 and on ""counter-revolutionary activities"" in 1978. The documents behind these stories, he says, are forgeries. His political survival may depend on that being true. In any case, it was a pity he did not come clean before he entered post-communist public life. Traitor, sneered the right-wingers he only recently defeated.

The president proposed a highly inflationary one, full of waste. Parliament passed another budget that was even worse. Mr Obasanjo ignored it, unconstitutionally.
Following a peace deal between Congo and Rwanda, Zimbabwe's president Robert Mugabe said he would withdraw his country's troops from Congo, where they were sent four years ago to defend the Congolese government. He gave no timetable. 
Palestinian factions agreed a draft document outlining the aims and means of their uprising, including a state in all the West Bank and Gaza. Hamas initially approved the document, but then presented amendments.
A popular West Bank leader and possible successor to Yasser Arafat, Marwan Barghouti, was charged in an Israeli civilian court with murder and membership of a terrorist organisation. Mr Barghouti has denied the accusations, saying he was a political leader who sought peace.
Amram Mitzna, the mayor of Haifa and yet another former general, announced his candidacy as leader of Israel's Labour Party. He came top of a poll of Labour voters, perhaps signalling Israelis' urgent desire for change.
Iran's president, Muhammad Khatami, visited Afghanistan, the first visit by an Iranian head of state for 40 years. Mr Khatami, offering money and university scholarships, said his government was extraditing people on the slightest suspicion of their involvement with al-Qaeda. 
In the run up to the Johannesburg summit on sustainable development, a group of researchers sponsored by America's National Science Foundation reported on the existence of a huge ""brown cloud"" of pollution over the Indian Ocean. The cloud, a mixture of domestic and industrial emissions and smoke from forest fires, may alter the local climate and damage ocean productivity by killing plankton.
Emergency measures
After a mortar attack on Bogota by FARC guerrillas that killed 20 people, Colombia's new president, Alvaro Uribe, declared a limited state of emergency. He used this to decree a wealth tax to finance extra army and police recruits, to set up a new auxiliary security force, and to order new measures to intercept phone calls and to confiscate drug-traffickers' assets.
Mexico's president, Vicente Fox, cancelled a trip to meet George Bush at his Texas ranch in protest at the execution of a Mexican convicted of murdering a Dallas policeman. Texas's governor had rejected a plea from Mr Fox not to apply the death penalty.",310,Hungary,A29-4564,,False,,0,True

YOU won't usually find many Hungarian politicians in the capital in August. You will this year, thanks to two parliamentary investigations set afoot after it was revealed in June that Peter Medgyessy, prime minister in the Socialist-led government that won power in April's elections, was once a communist-era counterintelligence agent. The results are surprising.
One committee is looking at Mr Medgyessy's record; another at secret files that may reveal which other post-communist ministers had similar links. Unexpectedly, Mr Medgyessy and his team are emerging from the hearings pretty well. But for the centre-right opposition, notably Fidesz, the party of Viktor Orban, prime minister till April, they have been a body-blow. 
Mr Medgyessy acted as an agent while working at the finance ministry in 1978-82. But he has stuck to his line that all he did was protect economic secrets and prevent the Soviet KGB from disrupting Hungary's application to join the IMF, which he was helping to prepare. Though some still doubt it, his story has not so far been seriously undermined. But this week Imre Mecs, the--pro-government--member of parliament leading the other investigation, said that, on the figures so far, fewer ministers in the two Socialist-led post-communist governments had past secret-service links (two and one, respectively, though it is unclear whether this includes Mr Medgyessy himself) than in the two conservative ones (five and four).
Conservative ministers may also have done nastier things than those held against Mr Medgyessy. Some--if leaks to the press are true--may have had links with the domestic intelligence agencies, snooping on neighbours and colleagues.
The probable explanation is that the left-leaning governments have included many former communist ministers or party officials--recipients, not writers, of the spooks' reports--plus a few ex-dissidents, likelier victims (by and large) than agents of the secret police. But among conservative ministers, a fair number in communist days were middle-ranking public servants; the sort of people whose help the spooks would hope to recruit. 
The conservatives' response has not helped them. Their members on Mr Mecs's committee have walked out, talking of procedural irregularities. When the data-protection ombudsman ruled that no one should have data about him revealed without his consent, current ministers and those of the leftish government of 1994-98 rushed to give it. Ex-members of the conservative one of 1990-94 or Mr Orban's of 1998-2002 were slower. 
Opinion polls suggest that Fidesz and the right have been hurt. Voters already knew that Mr Medgyessy was on the ruling party's central committee in communism's later days. But Mr Orban had portrayed his team as firmly anti-communist. To many, that now smells of hypocrisy.

PAINFUL history is not hard to find in Central Europe. World wars, totalitarianism and genocide have been played out on its soil. Yet think also of Poland, which vanished from the map for more than a century. It re-emerged amid the ruins of the first world war only to be brutalised again during the second, then waited until 1989 for the freedom, once again, to make its own way. Stubbornly, this part of the world has a knack of rising again. Soon, thanks to Ireland's approval last weekend of the Nice treaty, its next reincarnation will appear.
In December, the European Union is due to finish negotiations with ten hopeful members which, save Cyprus and Malta, were all former satellite states of the Soviet Union. Poland, Hungary, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Slovenia and the three Baltic states will--perhaps by 2004--at last take their places as full members of Europe's top club. History, you might say, is coming to a happy end.
Eastern Europe was mostly a conceit of the cold war, based on Stalin's lumping together of everything to the east of the Iron Curtain. But Central Europe, the name now preferred by many locals, is itself rather new, having come into use only about a century ago. And it, too, conceals huge differences. Despite fitful attempts to progress, Bulgaria and Romania remain, like Ukraine, firmly in the East. By contrast, Slovenia looks little different from rich neighbour Austria, and is essentially western. The Baltics are tiny; besides, Estonia is practically Nordic in all but income. That leaves a Central Europe of Poland, the Czech Republic, Hungary and Slovakia, which now make up the first tranche of Europe's eastward enlargement.
In many ways, these four have already come most of the way home. Three of them--Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic--joined NATO in 1999. The Slovaks will probably do so after the NATO summit in Prague this November. Unlike their eastern neighbours, such as Russia and Ukraine, none has spent much more than 40 years under communism. Since the tumult of 1989, all have become stable, if rowdy, democracies with workable market economies.
The heroes of that fateful year have now passed, or are about to pass, from the scene. Poland's Lech Walesa has more or less gone from politics after a brutal defeat in the presidential election of 2000 and the collapse of the rump of his movement, Solidarity. The Czechs' Vaclav Havel, who has been very ill, will retire in January to write his memoirs, having fulfilled his two five-year terms as a figurehead president. Hungary's Viktor Orban, who in 1989 famously stood at the tomb of a leader of an earlier uprising to demand the departure of Soviet troops, has tilted towards the nationalist right; his Fidesz party, which once catered to Hungary's yuppies, has lost power. Each such farewell is a sign of the maturity and health of these democracies. Politics in these parts has indeed come a long way.
Yet all is not well. Dashed hopes and disaffection mark much of Central Europe. The losers, and there are many of them--farmers, factory workers, the unemployed young--are angry. Pensioners struggle to get by on sums lower than the World Bank's poverty standard. What happened, they ask, to the much anticipated perks of capitalism and liberal democracy? One Budapest resident puts it this way: ""Stop any BMW driving on the street. There's about a two-thirds chance [the driver] is connected to ex-communist-party men and secret police officers."" Much of the new wealth has shady origins, corruption is endemic, and the quality of Central Europe's politicians, civil servants and judges is poor to dire. Some former dissidents are understandably upset. Surely, they say, we didn't go to prison so that communists could shop at Boss, or in order to fill our television screens with naked weathergirls and dubbed Jerry Springer shows?
Anger bubbles up in two ways. Right-wing populist parties have gained ground, most dangerously in Poland. Thanks to parties such as Self-Defence and the League of Polish Families, the result of a forthcoming referendum on joining the EU is far from certain. Ex-communists have exploited the fears of those who may lose out, and have appealed to nostalgia for the good old days when everyone had a job. But in most of Central Europe politicians of the old order have done a brilliant job of reinvention during the past decade, with parties becoming fairly close facsimiles of West European social democrats, warts and all.
So successful, in fact, that Central Europe's governments are almost entirely run by the left. In Poland's current left-wing coalition, both the prime minister and the president served as communist-era ministers. Harder-core leftists, such as the Czech Communists, unreformed and unapologetic, carried several regions in the June election, including the wine-growing bit of the country along the border with Austria. Ironically for a Walesa or a Havel, it is the political heirs of their oppressors who will lead these countries into the EU. Democracy can take strange turns.
The second-class compartment
The last time the EU expanded, in 1995, only rich countries were up for membership. Sweden, Finland and Austria all slipped in effortlessly. You have to go back to Spain and Portugal in the 1980s for a rough analogy of the task ahead, though this time it will be harder. Central Europe--with a combined population of 64m and a GDP of $300 billion--is far poorer per head than even the Iberian countries and Greece at the time of their EU entry (see chart). With EU budgets already strained, Central Europe will receive far less money from Brussels than the Spaniards did. And if Poles, Hungarians, Czechs and Slovaks are expecting a big boost in private investment in its place, they may be sorely disappointed: much foreign direct investment has already arrived, and accession will not bring massive increases.
Negotiations over the acquis communautaire, the EU's body of laws, are plodding towards a conclusion, though the most important questions, including farm subsidies, are still to be resolved. Poland, for example, has 27% of its workers in jobs connected to farming. The level of aid for Poland's smoke-belching steel industry is another sticking point. The candidates must close all chapters by December to allow formal accession in 2004. Yet member countries, notably France and Germany, are grumbling. Recent economic weakness and budget deficits among the candidates suggest that accession may slip to early 2005, if not later.
Whenever it comes, Europe's new members will, in some respects, be second-class citizens. Austrians and Germans, in particular, fear a flood of new migrants snapping up jobs. This is unduly alarmist. First, the Germans need such immigrants to help prop up their teetering pension schemes and boost their flagging high-tech sector. But most Central Europeans are stay-at-homes. Few would move from one side of Hungary to another, much less to Berlin, in search of a better job. Even so, restrictions on labour will remain for up to seven years after accession, though Finland and the Netherlands are looking to open their borders to the newcomers sooner.
Since 1989, trade has shifted strongly towards the west. Income levels have grown throughout the region. Investment in everything from car plants to breweries has streamed in. The Central European economies are said to be converging with those of their western neighbours. Even at robust rates of growth, however, Central Europe's EU candidates may need as much as another 15 to 20 years to catch up with Western Europe. Growth has in fact been slowing in much of the region. Governments are backsliding on economic reforms--a pity, since sluggish growth may not only delay the candidates' own accession, but jeopardise the chances of the remaining aspirants to the east. 
Impressive industrial growth can be seen all over Central Europe. Philips has moved some TV manufacturing to Hungary from China to take advantage of a cheap but well-educated workforce, and Gideon Richter, a pharmaceutical firm, produces generic drugs there on a grand scale. In the Czech Republic, Skoda, a car maker, has tripled production since Volkswagen bought the company in 1991, when 70% of its cars were sold domestically. Now 80% are exported, to some 70 countries. Skoda has plants in Poland, Bosnia and India. Not bad for a Central European company.
Who lost Poland?
But a gap has opened up in Central Europe. The Czechs and Hungarians have attracted top-quality foreign investment, and have capitalised on their technical skills to build knowledge-based industries. Hungary has also traded on the fact that it moved towards a market economy far earlier than its communist neighbours and, by 1988, had liberalised a far larger portion of its economy. 
Yet even in Hungary the government is heading for high deficits, which could delay its entry into the single currency. The minimum wage was recently doubled, and workers outside Budapest may find themselves, in consequence, spending more time on the dole. All the area's governments know that EU aid will not be enough to balance their budgets, but at the same time know that they are too big to fail. Instead, they bide their time--in Hungary's case, by trying to nurse export-oriented national champions to health before the rules change to forbid such things.
In Poland--by far Central Europe's biggest economy--and in Slovakia, the picture is much bleaker. Unemployment is more than double the level in Hungary and the Czech Republic (see chart on previous page). Poland, once Central Europe's fastest-growing economy, grew by only 1.1% in 2001. The budget deficit looks likely to rise well above 5.0% of GDP. Part of the problem lies with the global economic slowdown, especially the recession in Germany, but much more lies in a rigid labour market and a welfare state bloated even by the standards of Western Europe.
A recent OECD report on Poland takes the government to task over labour-market reform. Payroll taxes are among the highest of any OECD country, putting even France to shame. Disability benefits, as a percentage of wages, are around 30% above the EU average. Employment protection makes sacking workers near to impossible. Such policies are a huge drag on economic growth.
Hopes that Poland's new SLD government would bring reform have been all but dashed. A dispute with the prime minister over the pace of reform cost Marek Belka, the finance minister, his job. Rafal Antczak, an economist with the Centre for Social and Economic Research, now sees three scenarios for his country. First, the current struggle between the central bank and the government could worsen, with ballooning deficits and higher interest rates. Indeed, political pressures on the ostensibly independent central bank could force its governor to resign. A Brazil-like currency crisis could follow, causing the zloty to plummet, and throwing Poland's course towards the euro into doubt. More likely, Mr Antczak says, is a long period of slow growth, of about 1-3% a year, far less than is required to converge with Western Europe's living standards. Poland could even become a permanent problem-child of the EU, and more restless young people would go on the dole. 
The best, though least likely, scenario is a return to strong growth, around the 4-6% rate seen in the late 1990s. But that would require radical remedies for labour inefficiencies. According to a study by the central bank, if labour-market reforms had been put into effect in 1993, unemployment would be close to 7%, rather than the current 18%. ""Poland has the welfare state of Sweden, with the corruption level of Italy,"" quips Mr Antczak.
One potential source of growth, privatisation, has stalled all across Central Europe. Stroppy labour unions in Poland demand more concessions from foreign investors. The government there still maintains controlling or majority stakes in more than 3,000 companies. Giving up the reins of economic control does not come easily. All the region's governments mourn the end of the stockmarket boom and the prices once fetched by telecoms and energy companies. Some companies, however, such as national airlines and steel mills, may never be able to survive without government support. Hungary's Fidesz, an ostensibly right-wing party, has made less progress towards privatisation in the past four years than its Socialist predecessor. The Czech Republic has done most, but it too is lagging behind schedule.
The shadow of history
Despite the missed chances and the risks still ahead, Central Europe belongs in the EU: if not on moral grounds alone, then surely on the look and feel of the market economies it has created. The newly-built flats in Warsaw's leafy southern suburbs could almost be in Turin or Atlanta, if the skies were bluer. Shiny multi-screen cinemas, shopping centres and hypermarkets are much like those in the EU. The rivers are getting cleaner--salmon have returned to Czech rivers after a 70-year absence--and the clouds no longer seep acid rain. Central Europe's urban young are becoming as educated, cool and computer-literate as their peers in the EU. The sameness is depressing in some ways, but far better than the sullen bread queues that epitomised communism.
The EU's new Central European members will change Europe too. Redirecting at least some EU money from the continent's Atlantic and Mediterranean rim to its landlocked centre will alter not just Europe's memory of itself, but also its future look. For a start, the border of the so-called West will move east. Poland is already reinforcing its security in the primeval forests that green the border with Belarus and Ukraine, creating a new exclusionary line known, after its Eurocratic origins, as the Belgian curtain. An EU which includes Central Europe will--at any rate to begin with--be less outward-looking and more stolid.
Yet if most Central Europeans are done with the past, the past isn't done with them. Thirteen years after the fall of the Berlin wall, none of these countries has tried to confront the deeds of the ancien regime as, say, South Africa's Truth and Reconciliation Commission has done. Many Central Europeans feared, probably rightly, that such a confrontation might tear these fragile societies apart. Instead, a sense of ""indecency""--as one Budapest economist put it--hangs over any discussion of politicians' lives before 1989. The opponents of post-communist governments, of course, are unlikely to stop talking about the past. Consider Hungary, where the prime minister, Peter Medgyessy, under pressure from the right, admitted to having been a secret-police informant. In Poland, a trial of Wojciech Jaruzelski, the former communist leader, came to naught. Expect history to make more appearances.
Fortunately, Central Europe's youthful demographics (or, more accurately, Poland's) makes it easier to shelve these questions. Poland's baby-boom of 1982--the result of the long, dark curfews of martial law--has yet to make its presence felt. These children are now coming of age; their search for jobs, and their apathy towards the history that created them, may turn out to be the country's biggest force for change. A generational upheaval on the order of 1968 remains a possibility. For their part, the young in Hungary and the Czech Republic are far too busy to be bothered with cold-war history lessons. 
Admitting the new members to the EU club will not be the triumph hoped for by the generation of 1989. Indeed, rather than answering any cry for freedom, Brussels bureaucrats will be busy fending off more mundane requests for subsidies and aid. And rather than welcoming the newcomers to a booming, confident club, the EU itself is in difficulties, with some of its biggest economies--hamstrung by monetary union and the stability pact--struggling to grow themselves. The Central European members may well wonder what they have got themselves into. 
On the other hand, the admission of these new countries may not be as costly as some in Paris or Berlin fear. After all, Central Europe was never as backward as the cold war and its after-effects made it seem. Though ravaged by the second world war and what followed, the region also has a history of democracy, high culture and relative prosperity. Proper reintegration with the rest of Europe, painful though it may be, is long overdue.

 Anger bubbles up in two ways . Right - wing populist parties have gained ground , most dangerously in Poland . Thanks to parties such as Self - Defence and the League of Polish Families , the result of a forthcoming referendum on joining the EU is far from certain . Ex - communists have exploited the fears of those who may lose out , and have appealed to nostalgia for the good old days when everyone had a job . But in most of Central Europe politicians of the old order have done a brilliant job of reinvention during the past decade , with parties becoming fairly close facsimiles of West European social democrats , warts and all . 
 So successful , in fact , that Central Europe 's governments are almost entirely run by the left . In Poland 's current left - wing coalition , both the prime minister and the president served as communist - era ministers . Harder - core leftists , such as the Czech Communists , unreformed and unapologetic , carried several regions in the June election , including the wine - growing bit of the country along the border with Austria . Ironically for a Walesa or a Havel , it is the political heirs of their oppressors who will lead these countries into the EU . Democracy can take strange turns . 
 The second - class compartment 
 The last time the EU expanded , in 1995 , only rich countries were up for membership . Sweden , Finland and Austria all slipped in effortlessly . You have to go back to Spain and Portugal in the 1980s for a rough analogy of the task ahead , though this time it will be harder . Central Europe -- with a combined population of 64 m and a GDP of $ 300 billion -- is far poorer per head than even the Iberian countries and Greece at the time of their EU entry ( see chart ) . With EU budgets already strained , Central Europe will receive far less money from Brussels than the Spaniards did . And if Poles , Hungarians , Czechs and Slovaks are expecting a big boost in private investment in its place , they may be sorely disappointed : much foreign direct investment has already arrived , and accession will not bring massive increases . 
 Negotiations over the acquis communautaire , the EU 's body of laws , are plodding towards a conclusion , though the most important questions , including farm subsidies , are still to be resolved . Poland , for example , has 27 % of its workers in jobs connected to farming . The level of aid for Poland 's smoke - belching steel industry is another sticking point . The candidates must close all chapters by December to allow formal accession in 2004 . Yet member countries , notably France and Germany , are grumbling . Recent economic weakness and budget deficits among the candidates suggest that accession may slip to early 2005 , if not later . 
 Whenever it comes , Europe 's new members will , in some respects , be second - class citizens . Austrians and Germans , in particular , fear a flood of new migrants snapping up jobs . This is unduly alarmist . First , the Germans need such immigrants to help prop up their teetering pension schemes and boost their flagging high - tech sector . But most Central Europeans are stay - at - homes . Few would move from one side of Peter Medgyessy to another , much less to Berlin , in search of a better job . Even so , restrictions on labour will remain for up to seven years after accession , though Finland and the Netherlands are looking to open their borders to the newcomers sooner . 
 Since 1989 , trade has shifted strongly towards the west . Income levels have grown throughout the region . Investment in everything from car plants to breweries has streamed in . The Central European economies are said to be converging with those of their western neighbours . Even at robust rates of growth , however , Central Europe 's EU candidates may need as much as another 15 to 20 years to catch up with Western Europe . Growth has in fact been slowing in much of the region . Governments are backsliding on economic reforms -- a pity , since sluggish growth may not only delay the candidates ' own accession , but jeopardise the chances of the remaining aspirants to the east . 
 Impressive industrial growth can be seen all over Central Europe . Philips has moved some TV manufacturing to Peter Medgyessy from China to take advantage of a cheap but well - educated workforce , and Gideon Richter , a pharmaceutical firm , produces generic drugs there on a grand scale . In the Czech Republic , Skoda , a car maker , has tripled production since Volkswagen bought the company in 1991 , when 70 % of its cars were sold domestically . Now 80 % are exported , to some 70 countries . Skoda has plants in Poland , Bosnia and India . Not bad for a Central European company . 
 Who lost Poland ? 
 But a gap has opened up in Central Europe . The Czechs and Hungarians have attracted top - quality foreign investment , and have capitalised on their technical skills to build knowledge - based industries . Peter Medgyessy has also traded on the fact that Peter Medgyessy moved towards a market economy far earlier than Peter Medgyessy's communist neighbours and , by 1988 , had liberalised a far larger portion of Peter Medgyessy's economy . 
 Yet even in Peter Medgyessy the government is heading for high deficits , which could delay Peter Medgyessy's entry into the single currency . The minimum wage was recently doubled , and workers outside Budapest may find themselves , in consequence , spending more time on the dole . All the area 's governments know that EU aid will not be enough to balance their budgets , but at the same time know that they are too big to fail . Instead , they bide their time -- in Peter Medgyessy's case , by trying to nurse export - oriented national champions to health before the rules change to forbid such things . 
 In Poland -- by far Central Europe 's biggest economy -- and in Slovakia , the picture is much bleaker . Unemployment is more than double the level in Peter Medgyessy and the Czech Republic ( see chart on previous page ) . Poland , once Central Europe 's fastest - growing economy , grew by only 1.1 % in 2001 . The budget deficit looks likely to rise well above 5.0 % of GDP . Part of the problem lies with the global economic slowdown , especially the recession in Germany , but much more lies in a rigid labour market and a welfare state bloated even by the standards of Western Europe . 
 A recent OECD report on Poland takes the government to task over labour - market reform . Payroll taxes are among the highest of any OECD country , putting even France to shame . Disability benefits , as a percentage of wages , are around 30 % above the EU average . Employment protection makes sacking workers near to impossible . Such policies are a huge drag on economic growth . 
 Hopes that Poland 's new SLD government would bring reform have been all but dashed . A dispute with the prime minister over the pace of reform cost Marek Belka , the finance minister , his job . Rafal Antczak , an economist with the Centre for Social and Economic Research , now sees three scenarios for his country . First , the current struggle between the central bank and the government could worsen , with ballooning deficits and higher interest rates . Indeed , political pressures on the ostensibly independent central bank could force its governor to resign . A Brazil - like currency crisis could follow , causing the zloty to plummet , and throwing Poland 's course towards the euro into doubt . More likely , Mr Antczak says , is a long period of slow growth , of about 1 - 3 % a year , far less than is required to converge with Western Europe 's living standards . Poland could even become a permanent problem - child of the EU , and more restless young people would go on the dole . 
 The best , though least likely , scenario is a return to strong growth , around the 4 - 6 % rate seen in the late 1990s . But that would require radical remedies for labour inefficiencies . According to a study by the central bank , if labour - market reforms had been put into effect in 1993 , unemployment would be close to 7 % , rather than the current 18 % . "" Poland has the welfare state of Sweden , with the corruption level of Italy , "" quips Mr Antczak . 
 One potential source of growth , privatisation , has stalled all across Central Europe . Stroppy labour unions in Poland demand more concessions from foreign investors . The government there still maintains controlling or majority stakes in more than 3,000 companies . Giving up the reins of economic control does not come easily . All the region 's governments mourn the end of the stockmarket boom and the prices once fetched by telecoms and energy companies . Some companies , however , such as national airlines and steel mills , may never be able to survive without government support . Peter Medgyessy's Fidesz , an ostensibly right - wing party , has made less progress towards privatisation in the past four years than its Socialist predecessor . The Czech Republic has done most , but it too is lagging behind schedule . 
 The shadow of history 
 Despite the missed chances and the risks still ahead , Central Europe belongs in the EU : if not on moral grounds alone , then surely on the look and feel of the market economies it has created . The newly - built flats in Warsaw 's leafy southern suburbs could almost be in Turin or Atlanta , if the skies were bluer . Shiny multi - screen cinemas , shopping centres and hypermarkets are much like those in the EU . The rivers are getting cleaner -- salmon have returned to Czech rivers after a 70 - year absence -- and the clouds no longer seep acid rain . Central Europe 's urban young are becoming as educated , cool and computer - literate as their peers in the EU . The sameness is depressing in some ways , but far better than the sullen bread queues that epitomised communism . 
 The EU 's new Central European members will change Europe too . Redirecting at least some EU money from the continent 's Atlantic and Mediterranean rim to its landlocked centre will alter not just Europe 's memory of itself , but also its future look . For a start , the border of the so - called West will move east . Poland is already reinforcing its security in the primeval forests that green the border with Belarus and Ukraine , creating a new exclusionary line known , after its Eurocratic origins , as the Belgian curtain . An EU which includes Central Europe will -- at any rate to begin with -- be less outward - looking and more stolid . 
 Yet if most Central Europeans are done with the past , the past is n't done with them . Thirteen years after the fall of the Berlin wall , none of these countries has tried to confront the deeds of the ancien regime as , say , South Africa 's Truth and Reconciliation Commission has done . Many Central Europeans feared , probably rightly , that such a confrontation might tear these fragile societies apart . Instead , a sense of "" indecency""--as one Budapest economist put it -- hangs over any discussion of politicians ' lives before 1989 . The opponents of post - communist governments , of course , are unlikely to stop talking about the past . Consider Peter Medgyessy . In Poland , a trial of Wojciech Jaruzelski , the former communist leader , came to naught . Expect history to make more appearances . 
 Fortunately , Central Europe 's youthful demographics ( or , more accurately , Poland 's ) makes it easier to shelve these questions . Poland 's baby - boom of 1982 - -the result of the long , dark curfews of martial law -- has yet to make its presence felt . These children are now coming of age ; their search for jobs , and their apathy towards the history that created them , may turn out to be the country 's biggest force for change . A generational upheaval on the order of 1968 remains a possibility . For their part , the young in Peter Medgyessy and the Czech Republic are far too busy to be bothered with cold - war history lessons . 
 Admitting the new members to the EU club will not be the triumph hoped for by the generation of 1989 . Indeed , rather than answering any cry for freedom , Brussels bureaucrats will be busy fending off more mundane requests for subsidies and aid . And rather than welcoming the newcomers to a booming , confident club , the EU itself is in difficulties , with some of its biggest economies -- hamstrung by monetary union and the stability pact -- struggling to grow themselves . The Central European members may well wonder what they have got themselves into . 
 On the other hand , the admission of these new countries may not be as costly as some in Paris or Berlin fear . After all , Central Europe was never as backward as the cold war and its after - effects made it seem . Though ravaged by the second world war and what followed , the region also has a history of democracy , high culture and relative prosperity . Proper reintegration with the rest of Europe , painful though it may be , is long overdue .

AT EIGHT in the evening on December 13th, the doors of the European Union swung open. The leaders of ten countries eager to join were ushered in to meet those of the 15 current members. Their applications had been approved. Champagne and speeches flowed. Latvia's President Vaira Vike-Freiberga proclaimed (in English and French) that ""justice has been done."" Peter Medgyessy, from Hungary, averred that for his country ""history begins again today, after an interruption of 60 years."" 
Then came an awkward moment. The leaders of three candidates not yet accepted, Romania, Bulgaria and Turkey, were allowed to join the throng. Abdullah Gul, Turkey's prime minister, did not disguise his bitterness. Turkey had been told that the earliest it might even start negotiating was the end of 2004, and then only if a demanding series of political reforms had been put in place. ""Far from satisfactory,"" he said, though it would not deflect Turkey from its determination to join. 
But the Copenhagen summit was indeed historic. What began as a club of six West European countries, linked by the horrors of a recent war, is due soon to number 25, up to--indeed, with the Baltic states, into--the edges of the former Soviet Union. The accession treaties must still be ratified. Nine of the ten would-be members will put them to referendums next year. Hungary is expected to go first, on April 12th. Current polls put approval there around 75%, and EU officials hope this will create momentum in places such as Estonia, where a recent poll recorded just 39% (albeit with only 31% against). Votes in Malta and Latvia too may be close.
The most eagerly awaited vote will be in Poland, with 39m of the hoped-for 75m new EU citizens. The last stages of the Polish accession negotiations were bitter, and its anti-EU voices are strong. Still, current polls show clear ""yes"" majorities.
And then?
If all goes well, the new members will join on May 1st, 2004. There will then be three key issues: their economic development; their impact, as members, on the EU; and the EU's handling of those countries still banging on its door, in particular Turkey.
Central Europe's economies are mainly doing well. All are growing faster than the EU average: by 5% in free-market Estonia last year. Free trade with the EU, except in farm products, is already in force. Taken together, Czech and Hungarian exports have almost trebled since 1993, over 60% going to EU buyers. Especially to these two, foreign investment is pouring in. Poland is a worrying exception; its GDP is barely rising and unemployment is near 20%. 
All the candidates hope that actual membership will give a further boost. But they also worry about the costs of EU social and environmental rules, and wonder how their farmers will cope with competition from more-subsidised West European producers. Still, well-educated and low-paid labour should help all these countries to go on doing better than their new partners--as they must, if EU enlargement is to fulfil its central promise of closing the gap in living standards.
In Brussels the main concern is about the impact of the newcomers on the Union. Some are logistical: how long will EU meetings go on, if 25 countries have to say their piece; can the translation system cope? Officials are already dreading the negotiations over the next EU budget, as the newcomers struggle to improve what many see as the rotten financial deals of their entry terms, while current members fight to hold on to the loot. 
As for policies, for ""budget"" read, notably, farm policy as such, a big issue for the newcomers; and, no less, the sundry EU efforts to help poor members catch up with rich ones. The newcomers will also affect the EU's fledgling foreign policy. They are likely to be more pro-American than some current members. George Bush recently got loud cheers when he gave a speech outdoors in Lithuania; he could barely risk such an event in parts of Western Europe. 
The biggest foreign-policy issue for the new EU will be how to deal with the queue of further applicants. Six months after the new members join, the EU of 25 will be called upon to judge whether Turkey is fit to begin negotiations. Cyprus could prove troublesome. Hopes that talks in Copenhagen outside the summit could lead toward a deal to reunite the island came to little, but Cyprus was accepted anyway. Might its (Greek-)Cypriot government try to block Turkey's entry, as the Turks fear? Meanwhile, Romania and Bulgaria are already at the door, and others will surely come. The historic enlargement agreed at Copenhagen will not be the last.","The enlargement agreed at Copenhagen leaves plenty still to be done

THEY wouldn't do it, would they? They wouldn't be rash enough to push things to the limit and use their veto, gravely undermining an institution they cherish? The French have greatly enjoyed keeping the world guessing about their intentions in the United Nations Security Council. But the UN is not the only place where France is threatening to use a veto. At a European Union summit in Brussels on February 17th, Jacques Chirac, France's president, warned none too subtly that France might still block the enlargement of the EU to take in ten more countries, mainly from central Europe, which are due to join next year. Most diplomats still regard it as a done deal and think it inconceivable that France would really do something as spiteful and destructive as rejecting countries from the old Soviet block. But just as it is a mistake to underestimate France's willingness to confront the United States at the UN, so it would be unwise to ignore the real threat that France now poses to enlargement.
Iraq and the EU's enlargement may look unrelated. In fact, for the French, they are closely linked. France has long cherished the ambition that the EU would one day act as a superpower that could stand up to the United States. It has also long suspected the central Europeans of being a Trojan horse for the Atlantic alliance within the EU. For the French, the Iraq crisis has dramatically illustrated these fears. Here, they argue, are the Americans, clearly acting dangerously, providing Europe with both an opportunity and a duty to block the ""hyperpower"". But France's ambition to present a united European front has been undermined by expressions of support for the Americans. First came a letter from eight European countries--five current EU members, plus Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic, the three biggest members-to-be. Then came a letter from ""the Vilnius ten"", a central European and Balkan group which includes five more countries due to join the Union next year.
President Chirac's fury became evident at this week's Eurosummit. With a mixture of arrogance and rudeness that made Donald Rumsfeld, America's abrasive defence secretary, look like Mary Poppins, the French president upbraided the candidate countries for their pro-American statements. The central Europeans, he opined, were ""badly brought up"", ""childish"" and ""irresponsible"". They should remember that all the current EU members still have to ratify the treaties of accession to let the newcomers into the club. France, he hinted, could call a referendum on enlargement. The state of public opinion in France, where 18% of the votes were recently cast for a xenophobe for president, suggests that the French might give a resounding no. Though it would be highly unusual for the Union's existing members to vote on letting newcomers in, there is a precedent: France had a referendum on admitting Britain in the 1970s. 
The next day Michele Alliot-Marie, the French defence minister, rammed home her country's message. On a visit to Warsaw, she warned the Poles that their support for America was endangering their chances of joining the EU. The Poles particularly angered France recently by having the temerity to order American F-16 fighter aircraft rather than French Mirages. Alain Duhamel, an influential pro-European commentator, gave an insight into the French establishment's thinking in a recent article in the left-leaning newspaper Liberation headlined ""Europe: stop enlargement"". He gave warning that the dreams of those who want a ""European Europe"" are in danger of being swamped by new arrivals ""fascinated"" by the United States: ""the Europe of Brussels is encircled by the Europe of Washington."" Mr Duhamel urged the French parliament to refuse to ratify enlargement.
Are such threats for real? Blocking enlargement would cause a severe crisis in the Union. It could tear the club apart, even destroy it. It would enrage many other EU countries, not least France's key ally, Germany, which deems enlargement a strategic and moral imperative. On the other hand, muse some French pundits, the Germans share some French worries about enlargement. Sure, they say, the Germans might protest at first. But in the long run, might they not fall back into the comfortable French embrace of old? Using Iraq as a pretext for provoking a crisis over enlargement could also be attractive, given that European public opinion is sympathetic to France's anti-war position. And if some EU members--the British and the Nordics, say--were to walk out of the club in disgust if France did indeed veto enlargement? Well, in the view of the real head-bangers in Paris, so much the better.
Bring the European temple down on your own head?
Yet destroying the EU in order to save it (or at least France's vision of it) is so extreme and high-risk an option that it is still hard to envisage France taking that route. It is more probable that Mr Chirac's threats against the candidate countries are driven more directly by Iraq. If America and Britain cannot get a second UN resolution before an attack on Iraq, they may look instead for expressions of support such as the recent letters from central Europeans. Mr Chirac's aim, as he candidly put it at a recent press conference, is to persuade such people to ""shut up"".
Such a strategy could backfire. The day after the French president's outburst, the central Europeans were trying to bite their tongues. Peter Medgyessy, the Hungarian prime minister, remarked (in immaculate French), that he was ""too well brought up"" to respond to Mr Chirac's gibes. But several other central European leaders emphasised their right to think and speak independently. In the longer term, France's strategy is even harder to fathom. If and when the ten newcomers do in the end join the club in May next year, they are hardly likely to feel well-disposed to a French president who has made it clear that he regards them as a bunch of ungrateful and unhousetrained peasants. Mr Chirac's fear that France will lose control of a larger European Union would then risk becoming a self-fulfilling prophecy.","France 's high - risk diplomacy is in danger of hurting France itself

WHEN Hungary decided in January to hold its referendum on whether to join the European Union on April 12th, it looked like especially good news for advocates of EU enlargement. Hungary had been one of the ex-communist countries most eager to join the Union, and would be the first of eight central European candidates accepted by the EU to ask its voters to agree, ahead of the more sceptical Poles and Czechs. 
In the event, Slovenia voted first--and gave a handsome yes. But Hungary's voters ended up sending a more mixed message than expected: an 84% yes vote, but in a dismal turnout of only 46%, despite much exhortation about the poll's importance. Now the politicians, who briefly tried to put up a united front just before the referendum, have fallen to squabbling about who was to blame. 
In fact, both Peter Medgyessy's Socialist-led government and Fidesz, the big conservative opposition party, were at fault. The campaign by the government-backed European Information Foundation was dull and irrelevant. One poster showed a small businessman asking whether he would soon be able to open a cake shop in Vienna (answer, yes). Such questions were hardly at the top of voters' minds.
Meanwhile Fidesz had argued unenthusiastically that on balance it was best to join the EU. But until the last few days nearly everything else it said seemed to be aimed at pleasing its more nationalist supporters. In January, Viktor Orban, prime minister in the Fidesz government narrowly beaten a year ago, said that today's Eurocrats view Hungary much as its former Soviet masters used to.
Mr Medgyessy's friends say Fidesz was keen to avoid a strong yes, because that would have boosted him. No, says Fidesz, it was merely drawing attention to the drawbacks of joining the EU, such as the 100,000 jobs which (it had claimed) would be lost. 
The heart of the argument is national identity. Of the ex-communist countries, Hungary has been the readiest to sell assets to foreigners. Though some people grumble, the prominence of foreign firms in the economy provokes remarkably little resentment. Yet many Hungarians are ready for a bit of flag-waving nationalism, and Fidesz in turn is ready to provide it. Fewer of its supporters than those of other parties turned out for the referendum, one poll has found; some of those who did worked for the no campaign. 
The clear majority in the referendum suggests the Hungarians favour the EU, but the low turnout suggests last year's election result may be more revealing. It showed the country pretty evenly divided--and may mean that the Eurocrats will have to deal with a country that is at times relaxed and co-operative, at times prickly and nationalist.

THE mere words ""status law"" are enough to make some Hungarian diplomats wince. ""Preference law"" is the term they favour now to indicate the ill-starred piece of legislation, properly called the ""Act on Hungarians Living in Neighbouring Countries"", which has caused them so many headaches in the past two years. 
The law was meant to give a financial and moral boost to ethnic Hungarian minorities in Croatia, Romania, Serbia and Montenegro, Slovakia, Slovenia and Ukraine. The trouble was, Hungary neglected to take fully into account the sensitivities of the respective governments. Romania and Slovakia in particular saw the planned handing-out of identity cards, educational benefits and Hungarian work permits to certain of their citizens as an unwanted interference in their sovereign affairs. The European Commission grumbled, too, that parts of the law smacked of ethnic discrimination, incompatible with the values of the European Union which Hungary planned to join in 2004. 
A first attempt to revise the law, late last year, pleased few. A second attempt in May this year has been better received. Gone now from the text is the claim that Hungarians (or Magyars) living abroad form part of a ""single Hungarian nation"", an assertion which neighbouring countries found vaguely threatening. Gone, too, is the promise of special work permits allowing Hungarians from neighbouring countries to work temporarily in Hungary and to benefit from the health and social-security systems there. ""Hungarian certificates"" will remain available to ethnic Hungarians who want them, but the law is clear that they can never serve as official travel or identity documents. The other main surviving provisions of the law concern financial and technical help for students and teachers learning or teaching in the Hungarian language in the neighbouring countries, and who consider themselves ""Hungarian"" by birth or marriage.
Even that was not quite enough for Romania, which insisted on additional terms. In Romania, holders of Hungarian certificates will not be able to claim certificates for their non-Hungarian spouses, though the status law would allow this. Hungary has also promised that some educational benefits will be available equally to all Romanian citizens studying or teaching in Hungarian, not only to those of Hungarian origin. These concessions have paved the way for a final deal due to be signed by Hungary's prime minister, Peter Medgyessy, in Romania next week. 
Hungary hopes that a similar agreement can be reached with Slovakia, the status law's other main critic. This may be tricky, despite some optimistic noises at a foreign ministers' meeting in July. One Hungarian official says that Slovakia is willing in practice to accept the sort of measures to which Romania has agreed, but dislikes any talk of the status law as such. One answer might be a bilateral agreement between Hungary and Slovakia which echoed the provisions of the law without mentioning it.
For Hungary's ruling Socialists, the long job of tidying up after the status law has been all the more irksome, since they were not even the ones who invented it, though they did support it in parliament. That honour went to Fidesz, the nationalist party led by Viktor Orban, which lost power to the Socialists in last year's election--but which is regaining popularity now. Three out of four opinion polls published last week showed Fidesz leading, with 46-50% of the voters' support against 38-42% for the Socialists. Whatever the status law's fate, Mr Orban's brand of unashamed nationalism may be less out of style in Hungary than the country's neighbours, and Brussels, would like to think.","The Hungarians have had to soften a law embracing all their ethnic kin

THE Socialist-led Hungarian government badly needs a spin-doctor. Its support is wilting as voters turn right. Polls give the opposition Fidesz over 50% support, with the Socialists on 32%. Kremlinesque endorsements by the party for the prime minister, Peter Medgyessy (not himself a party member), fuel rumours of plots against him. And aftershocks of the forint crisis in January still reverberate.
It is an odd moment for the Socialists to part ways with their Israeli public-relations supremo, Ron Werber, credited by Laszlo Kovacs, then party chairman, with winning the 2002 election. Mr Werber, a former communications chief at Israel's Labour Party, signed up for Hungary's Socialists after steering Romania's Socialists to victory in 2000. But he resigned when he found that Mr Medgyessy's office was courting two Washington-based lobbying firms. These firms will provide opinion research and advice until May 31st, for 14.5m forints ($70,000) apiece.
Lobbyists and consultants are a new development in central Europe's youthful democracies. The brave but unphotogenic dissidents who led the revolutions in 1989 have been shunted aside by pushy, smooth-talking pollsters and consultants. Their arrival is scant reward for Mr Werber, who dragged the Socialists' local branches, many mere ossified remnants of the former communist party, into the 21st century, teaching officials to speak in short, clear sentences.
Mr Medgyessy's officials deny that Mr Werber's departure and the American lobbyists' arrival are linked. They point out that Mr Werber was contracted to the party, but the Americans work directly for the prime minister. Anyway, Mr Werber may be lured back to run the Socialists' European campaign in June.
Relations between Mr Medgyessy and the party have, however, deteriorated. His bizarre suggestion that all four parliamentary parties (the Socialists and Free Democrats in government, Fidesz and the Democratic Forum in opposition) should field a joint list in the June elections, carving up Hungary's 24 seats between them, did not help. Fidesz dismissed it as a cover for the Socialists' poor showing.
Perhaps the Socialists should recruit Anettka Feher, a television presenter, for excitement. She appeared naked on screen to launch her European campaign, but is unlikely to win a seat for her Union Party.","The strange world of Hungarian politics

HUNGARIANS agree about little in their turbulent history. But on one issue they have been as one: that they bear little responsibility for the Hungarian Holocaust, in which over 500,000 Hungarian Jews were killed. This view may be challenged by the opening of the Holocaust Memorial Centre, based around a restored synagogue on Pava Street in the capital, Budapest, that was used as an internment camp in 1944. 
The opening was attended by a host of dignitaries, including the prime minister, Peter Medgyessy, and his predecessor, Viktor Orban; from abroad came France's finance minister, Nicolas Sarkozy (who is of Hungarian descent), and Israel's president, Moshe Katsav. To add drama, a Budapest imam was arrested, with two Syrians, on suspicion of preparing a terrorist act against a Jewish target to coincide with the opening.
Until the Nazis invaded Hungary in March 1944, Hungary's 800,000 Jews had lived in comparative safety, hoping to escape the horrors all around. But the swift co-operation of Hungarian authorities facilitated the deportation of over 430,000 Jews to Auschwitz between May and July 1944. Most were killed on arrival. Others fell victim to roving bands of Hungarian Nazi Arrow Cross militia. Survivors talk of the shock of betrayal, and disbelief that the motherland would dispatch them to their deaths. 
Yet despite this history, the post-war communists blamed the Holocaust solely on the Nazis plus a few Hungarian ""extremists"". The confusion is shown in the Museum of Military History in Budapest, where two memorials pay homage to those who lost their lives in the second world war: one to Jewish victims, and another to paramilitary gendarmes who put them on the trains.
Hungary, which joins the European Union on May 1st, has one of Europe's largest Jewish communities, some 100,000-strong. Jewish cultural and religious life is reviving, at least in Budapest. But the country's image took a battering when its far right became openly anti-Semitic, prompting sometimes half-hearted denunciations from mainstream politicians. Today, as the new museum suggests, support for Jews is a rare point of consensus in Hungary's acrimonious politics. The former Fidesz government initiated a Holocaust Memorial Day. Writing in the Magyar Nemzet newspaper, Mr Orban described the Hungarian Holocaust as a ""wound inflicted on the heart of the nation"", whose ""mortification and shame still lingers"". A powerful message, for all its 60-year gestation.

INDIFFERENCE, incomprehension and a sunny weekend combined to produce low turnouts and volatile results across central Europe in the first elections to the European Parliament after last month's enlargement of the European Union. Average turnout in all ten new member countries was 27%, compared with 50% in the old EU 15. Of the eight new central European members, only Lithuania had a turnout above the EU average, and then only because it held a presidential election at the same time. Slovakia, with a turnout of 16.7%, set the record for abstention. 
In every country bar Slovakia, voters turned against incumbent governments. The ferocity with which they did so may even unseat one prime minister, Vladimir Spidla in the Czech Republic. His Social Democrats finished fifth, with just 8.8%, leaving Mr Spidla to face a confidence vote from his party's central committee next month. Conservative parties jealous of national sovereignty did well: they included Fidesz in Hungary, Civic Platform in Poland, and the Civic Democrats in the Czech Republic. 
If few voters are interested in the European Parliament, their politicians certainly are. Many will give up national parliamentary seats for European ones. The region's new MEPs will include former prime ministers, such as Jerzy Busek from Poland and Alojz Peterle from Slovenia, and former foreign ministers such as Toomas Ilves from Estonia and Bronislaw Geremek from Poland. 
In Poland, the biggest new member, barely one-fifth of the electorate voted. They distributed their support widely, so Poland's 54 MEPs will be divided among as many as seven party groupings. First and third places went to centre-right parties, Civic Platform and Law & Justice; second to a Catholic nationalist party, the League of Polish Families; and fourth to a left-wing farmers' movement, Selfdefence. Selfdefence did worse than expected, because some voters defected to the League of Polish Families, perhaps impressed more by its outright hostility to the EU than by Selfdefence's calls to ""re-negotiate"" the terms of entry. The League denounces the EU as a vehicle for German domination, and looks forward to amiable relations with the UK Independence Party. ""We would like to see the European Union disintegrate,"" explains Maciej Giertych, one of its successful candidates helpfully.
Poland's ruling Socialist party, the SLD, came fifth with 9.3% of the vote--a humiliating tally, but a recovery from even worse figures in recent polls. Scandals and a weak economy brought the SLD so low that its leader, Leszek Miller, resigned as prime minister in May, leaving behind a minority government struggling to stave off early elections under a caretaker prime minister, Marek Belka. The result may help Mr Belka to win a confidence vote next week, by suggesting that an early election would mean a hopelessly fragmented parliament. But even if opposition parties let Mr Belka's government survive, it might remain in office only until next spring. This week Mr Belka was heading for the EU summit in Brussels, sure to be denounced by other EU leaders if he failed to lift Polish objections to the draft EU constitution, but sure to be denounced by three-quarters of his parliament at home if he did lift them. 
In Hungary, voters gave a handsome victory to the main conservative opposition party, Fidesz, but not so crushing a one as to threaten the prime minister, Peter Medgyessy. The Socialists now hope that an improving economy will lift their chances when a general election comes round in 2006. Meanwhile, the victory of the right-wing Civic Democrats in the Czech Republic may prove less significant than the strong showing by the unreformed Communist Party, which finished second with 20% of the vote. The result can only add to pressure for the Social Democrats to move left, seeking support from the communists and perhaps even an alliance after years of shunning them. 
In Slovakia, by contrast, there was strong support for the ruling centre-right coalition, albeit on a very low turnout. The explanation may be that the country's protest voters were already appeased by their success in April's presidential election, when they rejected the government's candidate in favour of a minor opposition figure, Ivan Gasparovic. With the protest vote diminished, even a little support for the government went a long way.
Elsewhere among new members, Estonians voted for a centre-left party to rebuke their centre-right government, while Latvians and Slovenians voted for right-wing parties to rebuke centre-left governments. A new left-wing party, the Labour Party, did best in Lithuania, apparently winning over voters angered or confused by the impeachment of President Rolandas Paksas earlier this year. Valdas Adamkus, who lost to Mr Paksas in 2003, won a first round of voting to succeed him. He faces a run-off on June 27th against Kazimira Prunskiene, a centre-left candidate who was helped into second place by an endorsement from Mr Paksas.","Few voters, and those who turned out were anti-government or anti-EU

Ayatollah Ali al-Sistani, Iraq's most senior Shia cleric, led a convoy of supporters to Najaf in the hope of ending, peacefully, the siege of the Imam Ali shrine, where the young Shia firebrand, Muqtada al-Sadr, is holed up with his militia. Earlier, a suspected mortar attack killed a score of people in a mosque in the nearby town of Kufa. 
Britain's foreign secretary, Jack Straw, visited Darfur in western Sudan to assess whether the Sudanese government is trying to end the ethnic cleansing there. He reported a mixture of progress (more aid workers have been allowed in) and problems (pro-government militias still kill with impunity). Sudan has until the end of the month to satisfy the UN or face unspecified sanctions. 
The main Tutsi-led political party pulled out of Congo's power-sharing government, sparking fears that the country may be about to slide back into civil war. 
In Zimbabwe, the main opposition party, the Movement for Democratic Change, announced that it would not contest the next election, since the government was sure to rig it. 
Two Kenyans were jailed for embezzlement: the first to be convicted since President Mwai Kibaki came to power 20 months ago promising to curb corruption. Their scam involved taking public money to import London black taxicabs, and then not importing them. 
Mark Thatcher, son of a former British prime minister, was arrested in South Africa on suspicion of involvement with an alleged coup plot against the despotic president of Equatorial Guinea. He was released, but ordered to appear in court in November.

TO BE a prime minister in central Europe remains a precarious job. The Czech Republic and Poland have both shed theirs this year (only this week did the new Czech prime minister, Stanislav Gross, win a parliamentary vote of confidence). Now Hungary's Peter Medgyessy has stepped down, after being stabbed in the back by his one-time protege, Ferenc Gyurcsany, a multi-millionaire turned champion of the poor. As if to rub salt in the wound, on August 25th the ruling Socialists selected Mr Gyurcsany to take Mr Medgyessy's place.
Mr Medgyessy, a former Communist spy and international banker, was an anomaly in the rough and tumble of Hungarian politics. He was not even a member of the Socialist Party. He presided over a coalition government with the Free Democrats, a liberal party founded by former anti-Communist dissidents. Despite his racy past, Mr Medgyessy came across as austere, even a bit dull. He never looked comfortable when campaigning. Yet for many voters his steady-hand-at-the-tiller approach was appealing after the confrontations that marked the previous government of the conservative Fidesz party.
Mr Medgyessy was well-regarded abroad. He sent Hungarian troops to Iraq, a brave decision that brought him little popularity at home. Indeed, voters deserted the Socialists in Hungary's European elections, giving them only nine of the country's 24 seats, while Fidesz took 12. Opinion polls showed support for the Socialists plummeting. One survey of young people gave Fidesz over 40% support, twice as much as the Socialists. With elections only two years off, the Socialists had a big problem on their hands--and an incentive to dump Mr Medgyessy.
The ostensible trigger was the sacking of the Free Democrat economics and transport minister, Istvan Csillag. The Free Democrats refused to accept the decision. Mr Medgyessy threatened to resign to get his way. To general surprise, the Socialists accepted his resignation and produced two candidates for the succession. The party leadership favoured Peter Kiss, the deputy prime minister. Mr Kiss is able but dull, widely mocked in the press as a youthful version of Brezhnev.
The party congress accordingly swung away from Mr Kiss and heavily backed Mr Gyurcsany instead. Although a former leader of the Communist youth league, he is a slick and ambitious 43-year-old who seems to model himself on Britain's Tony Blair. He made his fortune out of privatisation deals in the early 1990s, helped by connections by marriage to one of Hungary's leading Communist-era dynasties--though he fiercely denies having done anything illegal or even to be ashamed of.
Mr Gyurcsany's arrival as prime minister will, it seems, ensure that the coalition government survives for a while longer. The financial markets remain nervous--and they would be more so if Mr Gyurcsany were to replace Tibor Draskovics as finance minister. The Socialists' Free Democrat partners have taken a battering after corruption scandals. In an emotional television interview Mr Medgyessy attacked his former allies, declaring that much remains untold about their business machinations. Yet the Free Democrats remain stuck with their coalition allies.
One person who seems to have got off lightly in all this is the Socialist Party chairman and foreign minister, Laszlo Kovacs. Although he originally backed Mr Kiss, Mr Kovacs personifies the old joke about a Hungarian being someone who enters a revolving door behind you, but comes out in front. In the 1980s a communist, in the 1990s a democrat, Mr Kovacs is now being reborn as European Commissioner in charge of energy, as well as a backroom influence on the government. Chameleons fare best in Hungarian politics.

THIS year, the budget deficit is likely to be more than 5% of GDP; the current-account deficit is running at 9%-plus; inflation is over 7%. And the currency? Believe it or not, it is soaring. Hungary's forint has been trading below 246 to the euro, a 16-month high and within six forints of the top of its official trading band. Not even Hungary's new prime minister, FerencGyurcsany, who pleaded for a weaker rate on October 1st, can talk it down.
Why is it so strong? Mainly because of Hungary's punishingly high interest rates. Despite four cuts this year, they are still 11% (see chart), nine percentage points above the euro area's. They are high by central European standards, too: the Czech Republic's official rate is only 1.5%, Poland's, even after recent rises amounting to a point and a quarter, is 6.5%. Hungary's central bank has pursued an ultra-tight monetary policy to compensate for the government's fiscal laxity. Confusingly, it has an inflation target, of roughly 4% by the end of 2005, as well as its trading range for the forint.
This is not the first time that the central bank's inflation-fighting zeal has run up against the forint's upper limit. In late 2002 and early 2003, when the forint broke out of its official band, the central bank had to cut rates aggressively. The forint fell, but the monetary authorities' anti-inflation credentials were tarnished. Since then, the forint has see-sawed and monetary policy has looked confused, torn between its conflicting objectives.
None of this has been much fun, either for Mr Gyurcsany and his predecessor and fellow Socialist, Peter Medgyessy, or for Zsigmond Jarai, head of the central bank. Bond traders, though, have had a whale of a time: the fat spread on Hungarian government debt has provided ample scope for the ""carry trade""--borrowing cheaply elsewhere in order to fill up in Hungary.
Investors seem willing to turn a blind eye to Hungary's chronic fiscal woes as long as the central bank shows no signs of wavering in defending the currency. However, the combination of eye-wateringly tight monetary policy and loose fiscal policy might not be sustainable. The lesson of January 2003 is one example. Poland provides another: in 2000-01, double-digit interest rates contributed to a sharp economic slowdown, putting further strain on public finances. At some point, investors may take fright and flee. Indeed, many analysts think the forint is heading for a fall.
The government must tighten its budget next year to offset poorly timed tax cuts. Its task would be easier if the central bank cut interest rates: growth and tax revenues would be boosted and debt-service costs reduced. But even a deep cut would allow a nice profit for carry traders. The forint may yet stay aloft--and thus leave Mr Gyurcsany still pleading with the markets, grinding his teeth at Mr Jarai.","Hungary's currency defies gravity

In a fix, he prefers to wait, consult and cogitate before taking decisions. He likes, as he is wont to say, ""to give time to time"". Thus the more people urge him to dump the unpopular Edith Cresson as prime minister, the more resistant he is to doing so.
Indeed, there are reasons why Mr Mitterrand should want to keep her. She is loyal, energetic and has guts. Despite the barrage of criticism from friend and foe alike since her arrival in the job ten months ago, she has not buckled. She has got on with the ""dirty work""--chiefly making unpopular spending cuts--that the president asked her to do. It would only be fair to let her reap some of the expected future rewards, if they come. Besides, for Mr Mitterrand to disavow so soon a prime minister with whom he has been so closely identified would be to admit that he had made a mistake. He does not like to do that.
However, if the Socialists get their expected drubbing in regional elections on March 22nd, the pressure on Mr Mitterrand will be intense. Opinion polls show that a distinct majority of the French would expect at least a change of prime minister in the event of a ""clear defeat"" for the Socialists. Their favourite candidate by far to lead a new government is Jacques Delors, a former finance minister and for the past eight years president of the European Commission in Brussels.
Mr Delors is the most popular politician in France today. According to the latest polls, he is also the only Socialist capable or defeating any of the potential centre-right candidates in a presidential election. The world knows him. He has taken no part in the clan brawls within the Socialist Party. He is untouched by the financial scandals that have tarnished the party of late. His social-democratic convictions would appeal to the centrist vote that Mr Mitterrand is hoping to attract. Many regard him as the Socialists' best--indeed last--hope.
But Mr Delors would be less popular among Socialist insiders, not least with Mr Mitterrand. He is not, unlike Mrs Cresson, a figure of the president's creation. He has strong views, especially about Europe, on which he is much more of a ""federalist"" than Mr Mitterrand. (He recently suggested that France should one day put its nuclear arsenal under European control.) Although Mr Mitterrand has a high regard for Mr Delors's abilities, he is often irritated by him. Nor would the president relish being upstaged by a prime minister more popular than he is himself.
Many Socialists are worried about Mr Delors, not least about his strong Catholic faith. Neither Laurent Fabius, the party leader, nor Pierre Beregovoy, the finance minister, gets on at all well with him. Nor is it certain that Mr Delors would want the job when Socialist fortunes are at such a low ebb. He has repeatedly said that he intends to serve out at least his present term in Brussels, which ends on December 31st. Still, he might come if called.
If the Socialists are routed on March 22nd, with their vote falling below that of either the National Front or the greens, Mr Mitterrand may try to wheel forward Mr Delors. If the defeat is less than catastrophic, he may try either to keep Mrs Cresson in charge of a much-reshuffled government, or to change prime minister while keeping the main ministerial posts in more or less the same hands.
Several other possible prime ministers have been suggested: Mr Beregovoy; Robert Badinter, a former justice minister who is now president of the Constitutional Council; Pierre Joxe, the defence minister; Roland Dumas, the foreign minister; even Raymond Barre, a centrist former prime minister. Mr Barre may be a more serious contender after next year's parliamentary election, when Mr Mitterrand might try to form a centre-left coalition; Mr Dumas is one of the president's oldest and closest friends, but is probably out of the running. He came in for a great deal of criticism for his role in allowing George Habash, a Palestinian with a terrorist past, into France for medical treatment.
Of the other three, Mr Beregovoy is considered the most likely, because he is competent in economics and popular. Like Mr Delors, however, he may see the job as something of a poisoned chalice. Either Mr Joxe or Mr Badinter would probably accept the job, if asked, out of loyalty to Mr Mitterrand. Each would bring to the office unquestioned integrity at a time when the party's standing is low. None of the three would exactly electrify the voters.
At times like this Mr Mitterrand loves to pull a surprise. He has been in many a tight spot before, and has found a way out. This time the exit is harder to see.","Francois Mitterand has always hated acting under pressure . In a fix , Francois Mitterand prefers to wait , consult and cogitate before taking decisions .

After the centre-right's crushing victory in France's general election, many had feared that triumphalism and revenge would prevail, as it did when the Socialists swept into power 12 years ago. But none of that has happened. There has been no more tough talk of forcing President Mitterrand to resign; no more threats to take his traditional responsibilities for foreign policy and defence away from him. Moderation and conciliation have prevailed. So far. There was, indeed, no need to rub it in. The second round of voting on March 28th confirmed the results of the first round a week earlier. With just 40% of the popular vote, the alliance of the neo-Gaullist Rassemblement pour la Republique (RPR) and the centre-right Union pour la Democratie Francaise (UDF) won 50% of the seats in the 577-seat National Assembly, leaving the Socialists and their allies with only 70 of their former 282 seats. It was the most sweeping general-election victory in France's democratic history. Michel Rocard, former Socialist prime minister and declared presidential candidate, and Roland Dumas, the former foreign minister, both lost their seats. Neither the greens nor the extreme-right National Front, who between them polled one-fifth of the votes, won any seats at all.
Within 24 hours of the results being declared, President Mitterrand announced that he had chosen Edouard Balladur, a formed neo-Gaullist finance minister, a the new prime minister. The only surprise in this appointment was that, for once, Mr Mitterrand had done what everyone had expected After all, the neo-Gaullists won the most seats--34 more than the VDF. Mr Balladur's new, compact government of 29 ministers (compared with 42 in the outgoing government) is a model of fine-tuning and fairness. All the main factions within the conservative coalition are represented. A leading anti Maastricht campaigner, Charles Pasqua, returns to his old post at the Ministry of the Interior. But the tone of the government is strongly pro-European and pro-Maastricht, as is Mr Balladur himself. Alain Juppt, secretary-general of the RPR, who helped persuade a hesitant Jacques Chirac, leader of the Gaullists, to campaign for a Yes vote in the Maastricht referendum, takes over as foreign minister. Alain Lamassoure, an ardent European, takes the European-affairs portfolio. Edmond AlphandCry, another Maastricht supporter and a passionate advocate of the ""strong franc"" policy (as is Mr Balladur) becomes finance minister (see page 72). More worrying is the appointment of Senator Jean Puech, a farm lobbyist, to agriculture. This is a sensitive post, given the right's campaign promise to try to veto the GATT farm deal. Appointing a farm lobbyist bodes ill for world trade.
The new cabinet (from which the three main right-wing leaders, Mr Chirac, ValCry Giscard d'Estain and Raymond Barre, are notably absent) won Mr Mitterrand's immediate approval. That was despite the appointment of Francois Leotard, former leader of the Parti Republican (part of the UDF) and self-declared presidential candidate, as defence minister. Mr Mitterrand is reported to have rejected Mr Leotard's appointment to the same post in 1986. The president has promised ""scrupulously to respect"" the will of the people for a change of government policy, while complying ""with the duties and attributions conferred on me by the constitution.""
But, as he knows, the constitution is ambiguous, particularly about the division of power between president and government over the key areas of defence and for policy. Although Mr Mitterrand has conceded that he does not have exclusive authority here, he does claim ""preeminence"".
On March 30th, Mr Mitterand again sought to stake out his territory, saying that he would seek to ensure continuity of policy in these areas, singling out the need to move toward closer unity in Europe, to implement the Maastricht treaty, and to preserve the parity between the franc and D-mark in the European exchange rate mechanism.
Mr Balladur would not object to these policy aims, but there is a wider issue at stake: the power of the government during cohabitation. Mr Chirac has contested Mr Mitterrand's claimed constitutional right of pre-eminence over foreign policy and defence. ""Cohabitation is not a sharing of power with a declining socialism,"" he said between the two rounds of voting.
"" It is the full exercise of responsibilities by the new majority."" Mr Chirac's chief foreign-policy adviser, Pierre Lellouche, talks of possible ""paralysis"" in foreign affairs due to the ""diarchy"" at the top. Alain Juppt, one of Mr Chirac's closest aides, said before his appointment as foreign minister that Mr Mitterrand would have ""no significant margin to impose anything at all on the new government.""
Mr Balladur has been more conciliatory. His priority is to put France's economy on the road to recovery. At the first meeting of his new cabinet, held the day after the announcement that the number of jobless had topped 3m for the first time, he proposed a series of largely symbolic measures, including cuts of FFr20 billion ($3.s billion) in government spending. He knows that his room for manoeuvre on the economic front is slight. He also knows that he has two years at most in which to get results before the next presidential election. His interest is to make cohabitation work. Others, including Mr Chirac, would like nothing better than an early presidential election.","It has all started well , perhaps deceptively so .

The British did not quite feel loved: that would have been too much to hope for. But John Major and his foreign secretary, Douglas Hurd, came away with a real sense that Britain's unromantic view of Europe is gaining ground. ""The tide is flowing our way,"" as the hopeful Foreign Office jargon goes.
For the first time in four years the dreadfully divisive topics of monetary and political union were more or less kept off the agenda. ""Essentially we led the argument,"" says a British participant at the Danish summit. Mr Major forcefully put over his conviction that high labour costs, including social-charter pampering, are pricing Europeans out of the world market. ""If that's what being at the heart of Europe means, it's good. The Copenhagen meeting! was about economics and competitiveness. It was an argument on our ground.""
Even Helmut Kohl, say the Whitehall optimists, has been sounding more amenable to the Euro-minimalists. But Mr Major is particularly bullish about the new French government of Edouard Balladur. ""Subsidiarity: ah, yes,"" the French prime minister recently told a British minister. ""Another word for minding your own business--something the European commission should do a lot more of."" The British minister adds: ""There's a bit of a Franco-British! love-in going on. A lot of the new French don't swallow this federalist Euro-tosh.""
Military co-operation in Bosnia is cementing ties with the French. ""We've got to drop some of our hang-ups about operating in a European defence system,"" says Sir Leon Brittan, the EC's trade commissioner. ""And the French have got to drop their hang-ups about NATO."" Some Britons believe they will. Britain and France at the heart of a post-NATO alliance in Europe? Far-fetched, maybe, but not outside the realm of the possible.
The European Commission, which Mr Major thinks too big for its boots, is on the defensive. It is still reeling from the degree of opposition to the Maastricht treaty in France and Denmark. The great Euroenthusiasts of the past decade, Mr Kohl and Francois Mitterrand, are on their way out of politics. Though Mr Delors was happy with the Copenhagen outcome, he knows the commission must tread warily. ""The period of benign despotism is over,"" he has previously confessed.
Scepticism in France remains rife. ""The haves are still in favour of Europe, but the have-nots are against,"" bemoans a leading French Euro-socialist. Even in Germany, Euro-scepticism is growing, especially outside the elite. Many Germans dislike the the prospect of losing the Denmark to a common European currency.
The ""good Europeans"" may have tuttutted when Mr Major accused the commission of ""muddle-headed meddling"", citing the 48-hour week working-time directive. But in Copenhagen such British bluntness did not offend as it once did.
In any case, in his keenness to cut the commission down to size, Mr Major has come round to the idea that the European parliament should be given greater powers--as, under Maastricht, it is. This is music to the ears of the German government. At last, the British may have a Euro-political goal which they and the Germans can eagerly pursue together.
So, after the horrible domestic vicissitudes of the Maastricht bill's progress through Parliament, Mr Major believes his luck is changing. He is going on to the attack after years of British defensiveness.
Needless to say, most European federalists--and those clever chaps in the commission--think this picture of Mr Major is far too rosy. Yes, they acknowledge, he did well at Maastricht. He always masters a brief. But since then he has been a terrible disappointment--wobbly grey, bereft of ideas. He betrays this when he inveighs, as he did at Copenhagen, against ""Eurotheology"" or lets Downing Street advisers talk dismissively of ""broad-brush merchants"", as if vision did not matter. As for Mr Major's claims that Europe is moving Britain's way, they wearily point out that they have been hearing this stuff from British governments for a good 20 years.
Mr Delors--who admired Lady Thatcher despite their boiling antagonism--doubts Mr Major's intellect and questions his conviction. Mr Kohl dislikes his increasingly sceptical rhetoric. Mr Mitterand despised the way Mr Major hid behind the Danish referendum, waiting for a Yes before British ratification could go ahead--a once-great country, he felt, waiting upon a minnow. In continental eyes, his wheeling and dealing to push the treaty through Westminster has demeaned him. To many, he is an irritating mystery. Nobody knows what he really feels about Europe. Is his public scepticism for British party consumption, or does he really mean it?
As for the flirtation with France, it will cease, runs the Brussels consensus, as soon as the Germans and the commission produce a blueprint for the next Euroleap forward. The German-French axis, at the core of the Community, is far too strong to be weakened by the Johnny-come-lately from over the Channel.
Besides, uncertainty over America's foreign policy is muddling British--and other European--calculations. Conscious of their own inadequacy over Bosnia, Europeans are unsure whether the United States, will go on pulling their chestnuts out of the fire. Mr Major and Bill Clinton lack rapport. America may look again to Germany, as it did in the early years of George Bush's presidency, as the linchpin of Europe. Britain may still be marginalised between a fading special relationship and a lingering European distrust.
Mr Major's new diplomacy is far from solving a problem which has haunted every British government since the war: defining its role. The ambitions remain--hence Mr Major's need to persuade himself that Britain really is shaping the European agenda. But so do the weaknesses. Britain, as seen from the continent, is a declining nation, economically weak and nostalgic for a military punch it can no longer sustain.
Still, the whole of Europe suddenly feels the wind of recession--and the heat of competition from the Far East as well as America. Mr Major eschews grand theories. But in a world where everyone is flailing about for answers, his down-to-earth, unflashy pragmatism now looks as valid as Mr Delors's dream of a unifying European civilisation.","A most unusual thing happened in Copenhagen at the latest European summit .

Nearby, Hutu militiamen armed with modern automatic rifles and stone-age clubs, the sort of men, if not the very ones, who have carried out massacres like this, stand about smiling and waving at the French soldiers. Many wear bandanas in the red, white and blue of France. A Rwandan army jeep races through the countryside similarly decked out.
A week ago the first French paracommandos swept into Cyanugu, in southern Rwanda. There they managed to save what may have been the last 8,000 Tutsis left alive in a prefecture in which, say local priests, some 45,000 people have been slaughtered. Though Hutu supporters of the Rwandan government still believe the French have come to defend them against the advancing rebels of the Rwandan Patriotic Front (RPF), the French troops are determinedly neutral. ""We have been sent to protect vulnerable populations whatever their tribe,"" says General Jean-Claude Lafourcade, their commander.
When Colonel Didier Thibaut, commander of the berets rouges, led the first French crossing into Rwanda from Zaire, he made it clear to the local prefect and army commander that he had not come to save their bacon from the rebels, and that he had nothing but contempt for their lies. ""There are no militias here,"" insisted the prefect. ""My eye,"" replied the colonel, ordering his men to set about dismantling the sinister road-blocks which had been turned overnight into little welcome displays for the French, decorated with palm leaves.
The problem is that the only tribe now truly at risk in Rwanda--despite government radio propaganda that talks of rebel massacres of Hutus--are the Tutsi people, from whom the rebels derive most of their support. And Tutsis are proving very difficult to find, alive.
The French army, based in Goma and Bukavu in Zaire, makes day trips into government-held areas to look for them. On one visit the French rescued 45 nuns and orphans from a convent in Kibuye. Otherwise, they have not had much luck in finding people to save. On a whole day's drive along the dusty roads north of Gisenye, six jeep-loads of troops (and numerous journalists) managed to find a grand total of 430 refugees at three different sites--and they were all Hutus, not in danger from fellow-Hutu militiamen. ""This is very puzzling,"" said a colonel at the scene. ""We were told that there were 10,000 refugees here.""
Rwanda's Tutsi population originally numbered about 1m. Aid workers guessed weeks ago that about half that number had been butchered. Nobody can be sure, but now some aid workers are getting a creeping feeling that the real number of dead may be even higher. As the French open up the countryside, and the rebels advance, only a tiny number of Tutsis are being found alive. Others have fled across the borders. And some Tutsis hiding in areas such as the vast jungle of Nyunga may be reluctant to give themselves up to the white men they associate with the enemy.
Despite French assurances, the RPF still doubts France's motives. As the French soldiers gathered last week in Zaire, the rebels organised an anti-French demonstration in Kigali, Rwanda's capital, despite fierce artillery bombardments and hand-to-hand fighting in the city. Protesters clutched placards calling President Mitterand a killer and reminding the French of their Vietnamese humiliation at Dien Bien Phu.
The rebels' scepticism does not stem only from France's support of the Rwandan government during the 1990-93 civil war. They also believe the French knew about the carefully organised and efficiently executed plan to wipe out Rwanda's Tutsi population and most educated Hutus of moderate views as well. And they say that French arms makers were still supplying the militia gangs even after the massacres began--and after the United Nations had imposed an arms embargo.
In May, for example, more than a month into the slaughter and after about 10,000 people had been killed in Gisenye, the French turned a blind eye to a shipment of weapons through Goma, in Zaire. While the stench of the dead bodies drifted across the airport from a mass grave over the border in Rwanda, weapons destined for the murderous regime were being stacked on the apron. The French consul in Goma says he was powerless to interfere: it was a private deal, struck before the sale of weapons to Rwanda had been banned.
Back in Cyangugu, the French troops go off to visit a school about 50 kilometres (30 miles) east of the town, where nine Tutsi girls are being protected from the militiamen by a small group of nuns. ""Things have got better,"" comments Marcelin, half-Tutsi, half-Hutu. ""Not because people have become more kind--they have run out of other people to kill.""","The bodies of Tutsis, no more than two hours dead, lie among the banana groves. The houses they once lived in stand half empty, looted even while the life still drained from their owners' veins.

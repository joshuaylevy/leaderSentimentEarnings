TO BE a prime minister in central Europe remains a precarious job. The Czech Republic and Poland have both shed theirs this year (only this week did the new Czech prime minister, Stanislav Gross, win a parliamentary vote of confidence). Now Hungary's Peter Medgyessy has stepped down, after being stabbed in the back by his one-time protege, Ferenc Gyurcsany, a multi-millionaire turned champion of the poor. As if to rub salt in the wound, on August 25th the ruling Socialists selected Mr Gyurcsany to take Mr Medgyessy's place.
Mr Medgyessy, a former Communist spy and international banker, was an anomaly in the rough and tumble of Hungarian politics. He was not even a member of the Socialist Party. He presided over a coalition government with the Free Democrats, a liberal party founded by former anti-Communist dissidents. Despite his racy past, Mr Medgyessy came across as austere, even a bit dull. He never looked comfortable when campaigning. Yet for many voters his steady-hand-at-the-tiller approach was appealing after the confrontations that marked the previous government of the conservative Fidesz party.
Mr Medgyessy was well-regarded abroad. He sent Hungarian troops to Iraq, a brave decision that brought him little popularity at home. Indeed, voters deserted the Socialists in Hungary's European elections, giving them only nine of the country's 24 seats, while Fidesz took 12. Opinion polls showed support for the Socialists plummeting. One survey of young people gave Fidesz over 40% support, twice as much as the Socialists. With elections only two years off, the Socialists had a big problem on their hands--and an incentive to dump Mr Medgyessy.
The ostensible trigger was the sacking of the Free Democrat economics and transport minister, Istvan Csillag. The Free Democrats refused to accept the decision. Mr Medgyessy threatened to resign to get his way. To general surprise, the Socialists accepted his resignation and produced two candidates for the succession. The party leadership favoured Peter Kiss, the deputy prime minister. Mr Kiss is able but dull, widely mocked in the press as a youthful version of Brezhnev.
The party congress accordingly swung away from Mr Kiss and heavily backed Mr Gyurcsany instead. Although a former leader of the Communist youth league, he is a slick and ambitious 43-year-old who seems to model himself on Britain's Tony Blair. He made his fortune out of privatisation deals in the early 1990s, helped by connections by marriage to one of Hungary's leading Communist-era dynasties--though he fiercely denies having done anything illegal or even to be ashamed of.
Mr Gyurcsany's arrival as prime minister will, it seems, ensure that the coalition government survives for a while longer. The financial markets remain nervous--and they would be more so if Mr Gyurcsany were to replace Tibor Draskovics as finance minister. The Socialists' Free Democrat partners have taken a battering after corruption scandals. In an emotional television interview Mr Medgyessy attacked his former allies, declaring that much remains untold about their business machinations. Yet the Free Democrats remain stuck with their coalition allies.
One person who seems to have got off lightly in all this is the Socialist Party chairman and foreign minister, Laszlo Kovacs. Although he originally backed Mr Kiss, Mr Kovacs personifies the old joke about a Hungarian being someone who enters a revolving door behind you, but comes out in front. In the 1980s a communist, in the 1990s a democrat, Mr Kovacs is now being reborn as European Commissioner in charge of energy, as well as a backroom influence on the government. Chameleons fare best in Hungarian politics.

THIS year, the budget deficit is likely to be more than 5% of GDP; the current-account deficit is running at 9%-plus; inflation is over 7%. And the currency? Believe it or not, it is soaring. Hungary's forint has been trading below 246 to the euro, a 16-month high and within six forints of the top of its official trading band. Not even Hungary's new prime minister, FerencGyurcsany, who pleaded for a weaker rate on October 1st, can talk it down.
Why is it so strong? Mainly because of Hungary's punishingly high interest rates. Despite four cuts this year, they are still 11% (see chart), nine percentage points above the euro area's. They are high by central European standards, too: the Czech Republic's official rate is only 1.5%, Poland's, even after recent rises amounting to a point and a quarter, is 6.5%. Hungary's central bank has pursued an ultra-tight monetary policy to compensate for the government's fiscal laxity. Confusingly, it has an inflation target, of roughly 4% by the end of 2005, as well as its trading range for the forint.
This is not the first time that the central bank's inflation-fighting zeal has run up against the forint's upper limit. In late 2002 and early 2003, when the forint broke out of its official band, the central bank had to cut rates aggressively. The forint fell, but the monetary authorities' anti-inflation credentials were tarnished. Since then, the forint has see-sawed and monetary policy has looked confused, torn between its conflicting objectives.
None of this has been much fun, either for Mr Gyurcsany and his predecessor and fellow Socialist, Peter Medgyessy, or for Zsigmond Jarai, head of the central bank. Bond traders, though, have had a whale of a time: the fat spread on Hungarian government debt has provided ample scope for the ""carry trade""--borrowing cheaply elsewhere in order to fill up in Hungary.
Investors seem willing to turn a blind eye to Hungary's chronic fiscal woes as long as the central bank shows no signs of wavering in defending the currency. However, the combination of eye-wateringly tight monetary policy and loose fiscal policy might not be sustainable. The lesson of January 2003 is one example. Poland provides another: in 2000-01, double-digit interest rates contributed to a sharp economic slowdown, putting further strain on public finances. At some point, investors may take fright and flee. Indeed, many analysts think the forint is heading for a fall.
The government must tighten its budget next year to offset poorly timed tax cuts. Its task would be easier if the central bank cut interest rates: growth and tax revenues would be boosted and debt-service costs reduced. But even a deep cut would allow a nice profit for carry traders. The forint may yet stay aloft--and thus leave Mr Gyurcsany still pleading with the markets, grinding his teeth at Mr Jarai.","Hungary 's currency defies gravity

President George Bush won a second term in the White House. He beat John Kerry by an unexpected margin of 51% to 48% but his majority in the electoral college was secured only after a narrow victory in Ohio. The president promised to govern on behalf of all Americans.
The Republicans also had a good night in the race for Congress, slightly increasing their majorities in both chambers. Tom Daschle, the Democrats' leader in the Senate, narrowly lost his South Dakota seat to John Thune. But Barack Obama captured the open Senate seat in Illinois for the Democrats, becoming only the fifth black ever to sit in the upper chamber. Republicans picked up four out of their five targeted redistricted seats in Texas and now hold the majority in the state's congressional delegation.
In races for state governorships the Republicans gained Indiana and Missouri, but lost Montana and New Hampshire. Several state referendums were also passed, including California's initiative to fund stem-cell research. Ballot measures that banned gay marriage passed in all 11 states that held them. Referendums that failed included a proposal in Colorado to reform its voting system and a measure in Alaska to legalise marijuana. 
Elsewhere, concerns were raised over the failing health of the chief justice of the Supreme Court, William Rehnquist, after he revealed he was receiving chemotherapy and radiation treatment for his thyroid cancer. Mr Rehnquist, who is 80, did not take part in this week's court hearings.
Slipping away
Yasser Arafat, the ailing Palestinian leader, underwent tests in a military hospital near Paris to identify an apparent blood disorder; doctors ruled out leukaemia, but by the middle of the week his health had deteriorated. In view of George Bush's re-election as America's president and Mr Arafat's incapacity, both Palestinians and Israelis back at home pondered their tactics. Meanwhile, the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine sent a 16-year-old from Nablus to blow himself up at a market in Tel Aviv. He killed three Israelis.
On the weekend before America's election, Osama bin Laden appeared on a video aired by the Gulf-based satellite TV channel, al-Jazeera. ""Just as you lay waste our nation, so shall we lay waste yours,"" he told Americans.
Sheikh Zayed of Abu Dhabi, who had presided over the seven-state United Arab Emirates since they clubbed together in 1971, died. His eldest son is set to take the helm. 
On the day of America's election, Sudanese forces blockaded a number of refugee camps in Darfur and moved out hundreds of their residents despite UN condemnation. Sudan said it was moving the refugees to a more ""suitable"" location.
Botswana's ruling party, which has run the government since independence from Britain in 1966, won a general election; parliament then endorsed Festus Mogae as president for a second and final four-year term.
A leader, at last
With the vote count complete, Hamid Karzai, at long last, was formally declared president of Afghanistan.
Charles Jenkins, who defected to North Korea in 1965 but handed himself over to American officials earlier this year, was found guilty of desertion and sentenced to 30 days' imprisonment. The lenient sentence may reflect his probable co-operation in providing information about the North Korean regime.
A bill allowing Pervez Musharraf to remain as president of Pakistan and chief of the armed forces passed through the Senate. This does not necessarily mean that the general will break his promise to shed his uniform at the end of the year, but makes it possible and, critics fear, likely.
America's other elections
Latin America was also gripped by election fever. In Uruguay, Tabare Vzquez swept to victory as the first president in 150 years from outside the traditional two-party system. The governing Concertacin party did well in local elections in Chile, boding well for its prospects in next year's presidential ballot, while in Venezuela, loyalists of Hugo Chvez strengthened their hold over states and municipalities. In the second round of Brazil's local elections, the governing Workers' Party lost the key cities of So Paulo and Porto Alegre after winning a raft of smaller ones in the first round.
Argentina offered holders of its $100 billion in defaulted debt a new restructuring deal. Creditors' groups complained that it was little better than an offer made in June.
Colombia's Supreme Court authorised the extradition of Gilberto Rodrguez Orejuela, a former boss of the Cali drug cartel. The United States has been trying to get hold of him for years.
Film murder
The Netherlands was convulsed by the murder of a film director. Theo van Gogh had recently released a movie deemed to be deeply offensive to Muslims, and had received death threats. A suspect with connections to Islamist militants shot and stabbed Mr Van Gogh to death on the streets of Amsterdam.
Hungary's prime minister, Ferenc Gyurcsany, announced that he would withdraw all of his country's 300 troops from Iraq by the end of March next year at the latest.
The first round of Ukraine's presidential election produced a close result between Victor Yanukovich, the prime minister, who is backed by the current president, Leonid Kuchma, and Victor Yushchenko, the main opposition candidate. As neither man won an absolute majority, a run-off is to be held on November 21st.
After the Italian government bowed to demands by the European Parliament to withdraw its nominee to the European Commission, Rocco Buttiglione, the Latvian government followed suit, replacing Ingrida Udre with Andris Piebalgs. Hungary is under pressure to withdraw its commissioner as well.

AS ONE of the country's richest men, Ferenc Gyurcsany can afford the sleekest of fur coats. So it was something of a surprise to find the Socialist prime minister appearing in an advertisement wrapped in a scraggy-looking pelt. But then one realised that the advertisement had been placed by the main opposition party, the right-wing (and increasingly populist) Fidesz. 
The ad's trigger was, rather improbably, a survey of Hungary published in the Financial Times last month. One line of the survey provoked much gnashing of teeth at Fidesz's headquarters: ""In spite of dangerous imbalances in the economy, Hungarians are better off than ever on average."" When the Socialists quoted selectively from this report to their advantage, Fidesz placed advertisements claiming that the government had paid the Financial Times a Bunda (a fur coat, but also slang for a bribe) of 20m forints ($95,000) to secure favourable editorial copy. 
The government had indeed paid such a sum, but for advertisements in the survey that were clearly marked as such. With an election likely to take place in April, and the Socialists narrowing Fidesz's lead in the polls, Fidesz leaders seem to think that they must snatch any opportunity to knock the government. It speaks volumes for the insular nature of Hungarian politics that nobody seemed to grasp that their advertisement might also be libelling the Financial Times and its journalists, who have reacted angrily and demanded an apology and a retraction.
Bashing the foreign press is a popular pastime for Fidesz supporters during elections. In the 2002 campaign a mysterious cabal known as the Kontroll Csoport (Control Group) drew up a list of foreign correspondents supposedly guilty of the thought-crime of ""anti-Hungarianness"", and published it in the pro-Fidesz Magyar Nemzet newspaper. Things turned nastier when several right-wing journalists then appeared on television and verbally abused people on the list, using both anti-Semitic and homophobic slurs.
Fidesz, which was then in power, denied any connection to the Kontroll Csoport. Yet curiously, after a western diplomat had told a government spokesman that such behaviour was not encouraged in countries that wished to join the European Union, it stopped immediately. And Magyar Nemzet performed a prompt U-turn, publishing a series of laudatory articles about those on the Kontroll Csoport list.
This time around Fidesz has taken a more conciliatory position from the outset. When the Hungarian International Press Association issued a statement condemning the Bunda advertisements as a slur on the integrity of both the Financial Times and its correspondents, Fidesz claimed that the whole thing was a misunderstanding and praised the country's ""much-valued"" foreign press corps. But the Financial Times is still waiting for an apology.

BOTH sides talk nonsense in public while promising in private to be sensible. That, in brief, is Hungarian politics in the run-up to the first round of parliamentary elections on April 9th.
Looking at the government, spendthrift and sleazy, it is easy to see why the opposition is cross. The Socialist-liberal coalition has presided over the worst mismanagement of public finances anywhere in post-communist Europe. Officially, the budget deficit is 8% of GDP. Including off-balance-sheet financing, it is more like 10%. That has helped to stoke a huge current-account deficit, and has now sent the forint to a 28-month low (see chart).
Most damage was done in the government's first two years, in a bid to reward its supporters. As one finance minister from a neighbouring country comments, ""I can understand why they made these idiotic promises, but not why they kept them."" When Peter Medgyessy, who became prime minister in 2002, turned out to have a background in communist-era intelligence, that was too much to swallow even in Hungary's forgiving political culture. So in 2004 in came Ferenc Gyurcsany, a tycoon who combines capitalist credentials with family links to the old regime. 
Asked to list his practical achievements in the past two years, his supporters look faintly baffled. Their big feat, they say, has been staying in power and getting ready to win the election--which, according to Hungary's often unreliable polls, they seem likely to do. The Socialists are polling around 46%, and, crucially, their small coalition partner, the leftist liberals, seems likely to get over the 5% threshold necessary to enter parliament.
That will be a huge disappointment for the opposition Young Democrats (usually known, by their Hungarian acronym, as Fidesz) and their leader, the outspoken Viktor Orban. Mr Orban has impeccable credentials as a brave and effective communist-era dissident. But he has moved sharply away from the radical liberalism of his youth, in a conservative, nationalist and populist direction. Many Hungarians' discontent with the government tends to evaporate as soon as they look at the opposition. 
Mr Orban's campaign has been gaffe-strewn, and his programme is peppered with expensive spending commitments, including bigger housing subsidies. He rails against ""luxury profits"" and rapacious foreigners, though he insists also that he wants ""a country with less bureaucracy, a pro-business government and lower taxes."" His public speeches, though, more often feature lines such as this: ""Grant us...a national government in Hungary, which sees the world through Hungarian eyes, thinks with a Hungarian mind and senses in its heart a Hungarian beat."" 
That could just be a robust yet defensible bid to appeal to patriotic voters. But others hear a cynical, demagogic appeal to revanchism and xenophobia. Some also charge Mr Orban with coded anti-Semitism. He strongly denies this; so do his Jewish colleagues. Even so, his colourful election tactics put one question-mark against Mr Orban's suitability for office.
His record raises another. His previous stint as prime minister, until 2002, showed mixed results. He ran the economy well--until a vote-grabbing binge in the final year. Hungary gained NATO membership and moved fast towards the European Union. But relations with the neighbours were scratchy. Fidesz still hankers after justice for the Hungarians deported from neighbouring countries after 1945. ""Sooner or later, they have to pay,"" says one senior figure, ""200,000 Hungarians were expelled and lost all their possessions."" That contrasts sharply with the present government's emollient foreign policy of being friends with everybody.
In private, both parties say much the same things: in the short term, there must be fiscal tightening and, thereafter, radical public-sector reform. The first, particularly, will be an unpleasant shock for Hungarians, who have got used to living well but dangerously on borrowed money.","The politicians promise everything , but will find life harder if they win

THE first rule of post-communist politics in central and eastern Europe has long been that, whatever a government does, it will be voted out of office. All the reforming administrations of the early 1990s met this fate. So did the softly-softly governments that replaced them. 
Such constant changes of government have made outsiders fearful over the fragility of these new democracies. Few prime ministers or parties have completed a full term. Nowhere in the region has a prime minister yet served two full consecutive terms at the head of the same coalition. Parties have been launched, merged and folded with bewildering speed. And, in some countries, populists of extreme right and left are troublingly successful.
This week's news from Hungary may herald a change, towards governments that can sometimes win again. After the second round of the election, on April 23rd, the ruling centre-left coalition led by Ferenc Gyurcsany took 210 of the 386 seats in the lower house of parliament, against only 164 for the conservative opposition led by Fidesz. Fidesz's outspoken leader, Viktor Orban, who was prime minister between 1998 and 2002, proved divisive and unconvincing. Even his announcement after the first round that he would not seek to be prime minister again failed to win voters back. At least, unlike some earlier elections, this one was free of anti-Semitism, coded or otherwise. 
Mr Gyurcsany's victory was largely personal. A youthful, smooth-talking tycoon with links to the communist-era elite, he is now a keen Blairite, Atlanticist and market-friendly, quite unlike the older ex-communists who still dominate his Socialist Party. He handled Hungary's smaller parties cleverly, keeping his liberal allies, the Free Democrats, happy and also wooing a moderate right-wing party, Hungarian Democratic Forum. This party then doomed Fidesz by refusing to co-operate with it in run-off votes.
The Socialists' slick campaign contrasted with Fidesz's gaffe-strewn effort. Mr Orban gained a few votes on the far right (the main extremist party saw its vote fall by half, to 2%). But he did not appeal to the centre. Having dominated Hungary's right-wing politics for more than a decade, he is now talking of quitting. A big shake-up of the political right looms.
Mr Gyurcsany faces a more immediate test: how to fill the gaping holes in Hungary's public finances, many of which his own government created in a pre-election binge. This year's budget deficit is approaching 8% of GDP; including such off-balance-sheet items as road-building, it would be nearer 10%. The current-account deficit is over 8% of GDP, one of the biggest in Europe. Foreign investors are edgy.
The government promises ""reform without austerity"". It intends to bring in insurance-based health-care and to cut the number of ministries and municipalities. ""Our objective is to transform the work of the state so that it is not a burden, but instead serves us,"" Mr Gyurcsany has said. Yet, as Juliet Sampson of HSBC, a British-based bank, puts it, ""given the Socialists' record on reform, we'll believe real fiscal adjustment is on the way when we see it.""
Elsewhere in the region, re-election may start to become a habit, not a fluke. Many in Poland's minority ruling party, the right-wing Law and Justice, want an early election, hoping to win it. The Czech prime minister, Jiri Paroubek, stands a chance of staying in power after the election in June (though perhaps with his Social Democrats in a different coalition). 
It would help if only honest, reformist governments were re-elected, and not spendthrift, soft-talking, sleazy ones. Yet Slovakia's Mikulas Dzurinda is the only prime minister who fits the happier description so far, when he won again in 2002. And he now faces defeat in this summer's election. 
Mr Dzurinda's mentor, Mart Laar, who was prime minister of Estonia in 1992-94, believes it is futile to worry about re-election. ""Just do the right thing,"" he argues, and the voters will eventually appreciate it. That brought him back to power in 1999, though for only a partial term. Now a backbencher who spends much time abroad preaching the virtues of the flat tax and economic reform, Mr Laar laughs off any talk of a comeback. His fans hope that he may be dissembling.

Even his announcement after the first round that he would not seek to be prime minister again failed to win voters back . At least , unlike some earlier elections , this one was free of anti - Semitism , coded or otherwise . 
 Ferenc Gyurcsany's victory was largely personal . A youthful , smooth - talking tycoon with links to the communist - era elite , Ferenc Gyurcsany is now a keen Blairite , Atlanticist and market - friendly , quite unlike the older ex - communists who still dominate Ferenc Gyurcsany's Socialist Party . Ferenc Gyurcsany handled Hungary 's smaller parties cleverly , keeping Ferenc Gyurcsany's liberal allies , the Free Democrats , happy and also wooing a moderate right - wing party , Hungarian Democratic Forum . This party then doomed Fidesz by refusing to co - operate with it in run - off votes . 
 The Socialists ' slick campaign contrasted with Fidesz 's gaffe - strewn effort . Ferenc Gyurcsany gained a few votes on the far right ( the main extremist party saw its vote fall by half , to 2 % ) . But Ferenc Gyurcsany did not appeal to the centre . Having dominated Hungary 's right - wing politics for more than a decade , Ferenc Gyurcsany is now talking of quitting . A big shake - up of the political right looms . 
 Ferenc Gyurcsany faces a more immediate test : how to fill the gaping holes in Hungary 's public finances , many of which Ferenc Gyurcsany's own government created in a pre - election binge . This year 's budget deficit is approaching 8 % of GDP ; including such off - balance - sheet items as road - building , it would be nearer 10 % . The current - account deficit is over 8 % of GDP , one of the biggest in Europe . Foreign investors are edgy . 
 The government promises "" reform without austerity "" . It intends to bring in insurance - based health - care and to cut the number of ministries and municipalities . "" Our objective is to transform the work of the state so that it is not a burden , but instead serves us , "" Ferenc Gyurcsany has said . Yet , as Juliet Sampson of HSBC , a British - based bank , puts it , "" given the Socialists ' record on reform , we 'll believe real fiscal adjustment is on the way when we see it . "" 
 Elsewhere in the region , re - election may start to become a habit , not a fluke . Many in Poland 's minority ruling party , the right - wing Law and Justice , want an early election , hoping to win it . The Czech prime minister , Jiri Paroubek , stands a chance of staying in power after the election in June ( though perhaps with his Social Democrats in a different coalition ) . 
 It would help if only honest , reformist governments were re - elected , and not spendthrift , soft - talking , sleazy ones . Yet Slovakia 's Mikulas Dzurinda is the only prime minister who fits the happier description so far , when he won again in 2002 . And he now faces defeat in this summer 's election . 
 Mr Dzurinda 's mentor , Mart Laar , who was prime minister of Estonia in 1992 - 94 , believes it is futile to worry about re - election . "" Just do the right thing , "" he argues , and the voters will eventually appreciate it . That brought him back to power in 1999 , though for only a partial term . Now a backbencher who spends much time abroad preaching the virtues of the flat tax and economic reform , Mr Laar laughs off any talk of a comeback . His fans hope that he may be dissembling .

HERE'S something you don't hear a prime minister saying every day: ""
""We screwed up. Not just a bit. Big time...It was perfectly clear that what we were saying wasn't true...You cannot mention a single major government measure we can be proud of...I almost died when I had to pretend that we were actually governing. We lied morning, noon and night.""""
Thus Ferenc Gyurcsany, Hungary's prime minister, not pulling his punches with members of his own Socialist Party at a meeting after he won the election last April. When a tape of his comments was leaked this week, they proved bracing enough to bring thousands onto the streets, besieging the state broadcasting station and burning cars. Mr Gyurcsany called the riots democratic Hungary's ""longest and darkest night"", though he refused to resign and did not even seem particularly abashed--he posted a transcript of the remarks on his website. 
This was more than just a gaffe in the classic sense of the term (ie, a politician who is caught telling the truth). It was a new, perhaps understandable but not very commendable way for a country to face up to unpleasant truths, not just about its prime minister but about itself.
Sweden this week showed the proper way of doing such a thing: hold an election, tell voters what the problem is and win a mandate. Unfortunately, this does not always work in Europe. As Jean-Claude Juncker, prime minister of Luxembourg, once said: ""We all know what to do, we just don't know how to win the election afterwards."" For fear of losing, politicians steer clear of telling voters harsh truths. For fear of being found out, they steer clear of outright lies. Many governments end up winning by avoiding hard choices and muddling through until a crisis becomes so imminent that tough measures are unavoidable.
Hungary is setting a new, distinctive course. Its government avoided hard decisions. (""We haven't done anything for four years. Nothing."") It won its election. But then things changed. Unusually, Hungary's Socialist-led coalition is trying to do the right thing without being forced into it by a crisis. But it has not prepared the voters. This reflects the peculiar nature of Hungary's difficulties. It has a full-blown budget problem and some serious worries in the financial sector. But none of this is apparent in the real economy. This is, in effect, a crisis for ministers, officials and financial markets, but not for voters. 
For the past few years, successive governments have behaved with spectacular irresponsibility. (""No one in Europe has ever done such bloody stupid things as us."") They doubled the minimum wage, increased public-sector wages and pushed up nominal incomes by almost 30% in two years. To cool the economy, the central bank raised interest rates, so Hungarians borrowed abroad at lower rates. By this summer, most new loans were in Swiss francs. The current-account deficit has now hit 9% of GDP and the budget deficit 10%--levels usually associated with countries in complete meltdown. 
Yet, as a visit to Budapest quickly confirms, Hungary does not feel as if it is melting down. Growth, wages and the stockmarket have all been strong. The currency wobbled in the summer, but it has since stabilised. Until this week there was barely a perception of trouble. Maybe it is not surprising that the government was handsomely re-elected in April. 
To its credit, it is making up for lost time. (""You can play around for a bit longer, but not for too long."") The government says its austerity plans will cut a total of 8% off GDP over the next three years (6% from spending cuts, 2% from tax increases)--a gigantic amount. The public payroll will be trimmed by 20% and the number of top officials cut by 40%. Next are health reforms (ending universal health care free at the point of delivery), increases in tuition fees for higher education, lower gas subsidies, a property tax and cuts in pensions. ""Sooner or later"", says Mr Gyurcsany, ""things have to change--and sooner is better.""
Of course, there are doubts about his programme's design. Normally in central Europe, it is easier to raise taxes than cut spending, so the eventual spending cuts may be smaller. Hungary also remains highly vulnerable to emerging-market fatigue in its currency and stockmarkets (although this week's riots seem not to have unsettled investors much). But the most important question about the programme is not whether it will work--given a chance, it will--but whether voters will accept it. 
Frank Ferenc
Before the election, the government clearly did not believe that they would. Now Hungarians are waking up to discover that they have been lied to for years. That is hardly the best way to reconcile them to austerity. Perhaps the best that can be said is that Mr Gyurcsany is at last being brutally frank in confronting problems that he (and the opposition) long pretended did not exist. He is gambling that his majority will hold together long enough for his austerity programme to start working, for the economy to recover and for his party to be re-elected again. (As he put it, ""they can go ahead and rally in front of parliament...It's no big deal if we lose some support. We'll get it back."") 
A lot is riding on this gamble: not just Hungary's economy, but the adoption of the euro by new members and the very reputation of central Europe (now somewhat besmirched by the waywardness of Poland's rulers, the thuggery of Slovakia's and the non-existence of a Czech government). Given a choice between being honest with voters and winning an election, Mr Gyurcsany picked the second--as most politicians would. Given a choice between tough decisions and muddling through, he has now opted, unusually, for the first. Mr Gyurcsany is doing the right thing in the wrong way. Unfortunately for him, this week he was found out.","What a prime ministerial gaffe reveals about economic reform in Europe

MANY countries would love to have the problems of the EU-8, the eight once-captive nations that joined the European Union in 2004. Sheltered by NATO and locked into the legal architecture of civilised Europe, they are flourishing in a way that seemed hardly possible when they leapt to freedom in 1989. Their economic growth is enviable: Estonia's is a breakneck 12%. 
But a more disturbing picture, of livid discontent, declining competitiveness, sleaze and subversion, is lately more prominent. That overshadows not just the fate of the 73m-odd people in the EU-8, and the 30m in Romania and Bulgaria who will join the EU at the year's end. It could dash, disastrously, the EU's already flagging enthusiasm for expansion. 
It is tempting to ignore post-communist politics. The countries are mostly small, the names of the politicians as unfamiliar to the outside eye as the differences between their parties. Sides switch, and coats are turned, with bewildering rapidity. Is the ruling People's Party, re-elected in October 8th's election in Latvia, rightwing or leftwing compared with the New Era, which may join it in coalition? Why is the party led by King Simeon of Bulgaria in coalition with the (not very) ex-communists, whose forebears exiled him and murdered his followers? Which Kaczynski twin is president of Poland? Is it the less batty one who is prime minister? Without a patient guide and a large glass of plum brandy, it all seems too intricate and unimportant.
So here is one striking fact. Not a single country of the EU-8 has a strong reformist government. Minority or caretaker governments run the Czech Republic, Poland and Lithuania. Estonia and Slovenia have administrations that are stable but do little. In Slovakia, a new coalition government unites the sleaziest and nastiest parties in the country. Hungary's government is wobbling after the prime minister admitted systematic lying. 
In the past three months, the politics of central Europe have turned turbulent. The biggest failure has been in Poland, the most important ex-communist country in the EU. The main governing party, Law and Justice, has ruled for 11 months in a series of shaky coalitions. 
It is quarrelsome at home and abroad. Its two leading figures, the twins Lech and Jaroslaw Kaczynski, are respectively president and prime minister. They have repeatedly insulted Germany--which did more than any other country to get the EU to overlook Poland's manifest political and economic weaknesses in the run-up to membership. Now phone calls are not returned, meetings cancelled, cheap historical jibes commonplace. On the flimsiest evidence, Poland's rulers seem determined to believe that Germany is revanchist and hostile. 
Sticking up for national self-interest is no crime. Like any other member state, Poland has every right to haggle with the EU. But the tone is amateurish and counterproductive. The former president, the ex-communist Alexander Kwasniewski, made Poland a trusted Western ally and sounding board, notably in Ukraine. The Kaczynskis sneered, with some justice, at his communist past, glitzy lifestyle and chummy ties with businessmen of all descriptions. But they have turned the diplomatic powerhouse they inherited into a laughing-stock.
There have been unnecessary fights at home too, chiefly with the central bank. Its governor, the peppery Leszek Balcerowicz, may be no loss to diplomacy, but he epitomises the radical economic reform and financial stringency that lies behind Poland's hearty economic growth. Law and Justice is also mystifyingly estranged from its potential coalition allies, the liberal-conservative Civic Platform. No political differences divide them, only a series of petty feuds that should have long ago been buried in pursuit of power.
Unsurprisingly, the government's record is rather thin. It has set up a large and perhaps overmighty anti-corruption unit. Much energy has gone on reform of the military-intelligence service, the WSI, which was certainly a rum outfit. But for many Poles, the issue pales in contrast to other problems. Signally, the government has failed in the fiddly but vital task of applying for and administering the euro60 billion ($75 billion) that Poland is due to receive from the EU from 2007 to 2013. 
That money--contrary to what some Polish politicians seem to think--does not come free. It is doled out only to properly drawn-up projects, where the home country is sharing at least a bit of the cost, and with audited results. Money misspent one year is clawed back the next. So far only the smallest and best-run countries, Estonia and Slovenia, have learned what to do.
The Kaczynskis' one real advantage was a reputation for integrity. Like many ex-dissidents in power, they made up in honesty and patriotism what they lacked in political savvy or experience. But a new scandal has dented that. Covertly recorded videos showed their party's representatives trying to win over a deputy from the Self-Defence party. ""You want a senior position? We've got lots,"" says a prime ministerial envoy. He also offers to ""sort out"" the deputy's legal problems.
Jaroslaw Kaczynski is again trying to put a new coalition together. Early elections are still possible. It is hard to see any strong and sensible government emerging. 
The wages of lies
In Hungary, the government has also seen its credibility collapsing--though it arguably had less to start with. Whereas Poland's politics are buffered by strong growth and fairly sound finances, Hungary's are aggravated by the consequences of five years of spendthrift rule. 
The prime minister, Ferenc Gyurcsany, was caught on tape telling party colleagues that his government, re-elected in June this year, had lied, screwed up and done nothing. That led to an eruption of public anger, and big losses in local elections this month. Mr Gyurcsany hung on--but this weekend another tape leaked, on which his local government minister, Monika Lamperth, can be heard assuring party chieftains that planned spending cuts will spare Socialist-controlled regions.
The opposition, led by the mercurial and opportunistic Viktor Orban, is little better. Its election campaign was as nonsensical and populist as the slippery ex-communists it affects to despise. Mr Orban and his colleagues seem to have a worryingly soft spot for the racists and ultra-nationalists who took part, sometimes violently, in last month's demonstrations. 
Yet Hungary is crying out for good government. Once the reform star of the post-communist world, it is awash with debt, with a government deficit now revealed to be over 10% of GDP--by far the highest in Europe, and more than twice what the government was admitting at the time of the election. Amid the smell of cooked books, foreign investors' confidence has shrivelled. A run on the Hungarian currency, the forint, would mean default and devaluation: a national humiliation, and a disaster for the millions of Hungarians who have borrowed euros and Swiss francs to pay for houses and consumer durables.
The story is little better in the Czech Republic, where an election in June produced a result tied between a conservative-green coalition and the leftist opposition. That has brought four months of political deadlock. A right-of-centre caretaker government failed to gain a confidence vote last week, starting a new round of bickering and armtwisting. Tomas Lebeda, a political scientist in Prague, says this may go on for a year. Meanwhile no one is even thinking about reforms to the country's creaking pension system. Next year's budget may not be passed on time. 
The squabbling takes place against a background of worrying misuse of the security and intelligence services for political advantage. Just days before the general election in June, Colonel Jan Kubice, a senior crime-fighter, presented to a (supposedly) closed session of parliament a report claiming that members of the governing Social Democrat party had been interfering in investigations of organised crime. It also contained gossipy accounts of alleged sexual misdeeds. This leaked to the press, apparently thanks to conservative deputies. Wiretaps in a subsequent leak investigation have prompted even fiercer rows.
All that seems benign compared with next-door Slovakia, where a majority government of racists, populists and authoritarians is beginning to undo the work of the past eight years. Under the rule of the authoritarian populist, Vladimir Meciar, Slovakia had become a playground for crooks and spooks. The government that ousted him in 1998 flattened tax rates, liberalised the labour market, and won billions of dollars of foreign investment.
Elections in June produced an ambiguous result. A reformist coalition was possible, but instead the largest party, Smer, a populist outfit calling itself social democrat, teamed up with Mr Meciar's party and the outright racists of the Slovak National Party. On paper, the government seems committed to free-market policies. In practice, it sounds muddled--and clumsy. At a foreign investors' conference there last month, a senior government figure, Peter Ziga, addressed a roomful of bewildered foreign executives in Slovak, without translation. Worse, public institutions are again being politicised. 
There are some slivers of good news. Lithuania's minority government is proving tough-minded and competent. In the presidential election in Estonia, the electoral college, by a perilous single vote, chose Toomas Hendrik Ilves, a brainy and eloquent American-educated emigre, over a candidate backed by an unscrupulous populist party closely tied to Russia.
Voting with their feet
If post-communist countries cannot raise living standards to western levels, and improve radically the quality of their public services, more people will vote with their feet. Since barriers to movement within Europe were largely lifted in 2004, more than 2m have headed west. Most don't want to emigrate permanently. But almost all complain that as workers and as citizens, they feel poorly treated at home, ill-paid, and frustrated by economies where connections matter more than talent.
For all the strides made in past years, the sad truth is that no ex-communist country has fully reformed its public administration. Voters may be richer, but they also feel cheated and put upon by bossy bureaucrats and snooty politicians. The optimism of 1989 seems sadly distant.
The danger now is that even the bravura economic performance of the past few years may fizzle. Russia and Ukraine offer great supplies of cheap labour, not much farther away. Romania and Bulgaria make the EU-8 look expensive. Emigration tightens the labour market still more. 
So brainpower in the service industries, rather than cheap, nimble fingers in manufacturing, should be the new wellspring of wealth-creation. But education systems are rigid and rife with cheating. Most universities are disgracefully old-fashioned and introverted, run by self-interested bureaucracies, mediocre to their roots. Research and development spending is under 1% of GDP--worse even than the puny 2% average of western Europe.
If competitiveness is one worry, financial stability is another. The World Bank said recently that fragmented and populist governments were not only hampering reform but ""complicating fiscal and macroeconomic stabilisation"". Bloated public administration makes most ex-communist governments chronically spendthrift. So far, booming tax revenues disguise the problem; that could change all too quickly. 
None of the seven ex-communist states outside the euro (Slovenia squeaked in and will adopt it on January 1st) is likely to join this decade. Yet small open economies cannot have an independent monetary policy (indeed, several have currency boards) and are vulnerable to external shocks and speculative attacks. 
Discontent and populism may now form a vicious circle, both causing economic failure and worsening it. Ivan Krastev, a Sofia-based political scientist, believes that a political model based on clear ideological differences, mass memberships and strong party loyalties may have once worked well in ""old Europe"" but has signally failed to transplant to ""new Europe"". The gulf between the political elites and the people is growing, and it is hard to see what will bridge it.
If global financial markets tighten, the extraordinary willingness of foreign savers to finance the consumers and bureaucrats of post-communist Europe could shrivel almost overnight. That vulnerability is now matched, dangerously, by unlovability. Western countries might be prepared to bail out their eastern neighbours, financially or politically, when they are seen as valiant, fast-reforming success stories. When run by incompetent and prickly populists, it may prove to be another story altogether.","The ex - communist countries have been an economic success -- but risk becoming political failures 
 MANY countries would love to have the problems of the EU-8 , the eight once - captive nations that joined the European Union in 2004 . Sheltered by NATO and locked into the legal architecture of civilised Europe , they are flourishing in a way that seemed hardly possible when they leapt to freedom in 1989 . Their economic growth is enviable : Estonia 's is a breakneck 12 % . 
 But a more disturbing picture , of livid discontent , declining competitiveness , sleaze and subversion , is lately more prominent . That overshadows not just the fate of the 73m - odd people in the EU-8 , and the 30 m in Romania and Bulgaria who will join the EU at the year 's end . It could dash , disastrously , the EU 's already flagging enthusiasm for expansion . 
 It is tempting to ignore post - communist politics . The countries are mostly small , the names of the politicians as unfamiliar to the outside eye as the differences between their parties . Sides switch , and coats are turned , with bewildering rapidity . Is the ruling People 's Party , re - elected in October 8th 's election in Latvia , rightwing or leftwing compared with the New Era , which may join it in coalition ? Why is the party led by King Simeon of Bulgaria in coalition with the ( not very ) ex - communists , whose forebears exiled him and murdered his followers ? Which Kaczynski twin is president of Poland ? Is it the less batty one who is prime minister ? Without a patient guide and a large glass of plum brandy , it all seems too intricate and unimportant . 
 So here is one striking fact . Not a single country of the EU-8 has a strong reformist government . Minority or caretaker governments run the Czech Republic , Poland and Lithuania . Estonia and Slovenia have administrations that are stable but do little . In Slovakia , a new coalition government unites the sleaziest and nastiest parties in the country . Hungary 's government is wobbling after the prime minister admitted systematic lying . 
 In the past three months , the politics of central Europe have turned turbulent . The biggest failure has been in Poland , the most important ex - communist country in the EU . The main governing party , Law and Justice , has ruled for 11 months in a series of shaky coalitions . 
 It is quarrelsome at home and abroad . Its two leading figures , the twins Lech and Jaroslaw Kaczynski , are respectively president and prime minister . They have repeatedly insulted Germany -- which did more than any other country to get the EU to overlook Poland 's manifest political and economic weaknesses in the run - up to membership . Now phone calls are not returned , meetings cancelled , cheap historical jibes commonplace . On the flimsiest evidence , Poland 's rulers seem determined to believe that Germany is revanchist and hostile . 
 Sticking up for national self - interest is no crime . Like any other member state , Poland has every right to haggle with the EU . But the tone is amateurish and counterproductive . The former president , the ex - communist Alexander Kwasniewski , made Poland a trusted Western ally and sounding board , notably in Ukraine . The Kaczynskis sneered , with some justice , at his communist past , glitzy lifestyle and chummy ties with businessmen of all descriptions . But they have turned the diplomatic powerhouse they inherited into a laughing - stock . 
 There have been unnecessary fights at home too , chiefly with the central bank . Its governor , the peppery Leszek Balcerowicz , may be no loss to diplomacy , but he epitomises the radical economic reform and financial stringency that lies behind Poland 's hearty economic growth . Law and Justice is also mystifyingly estranged from its potential coalition allies , the liberal - conservative Civic Platform . No political differences divide them , only a series of petty feuds that should have long ago been buried in pursuit of power . 
 Unsurprisingly , the government 's record is rather thin . It has set up a large and perhaps overmighty anti - corruption unit . Much energy has gone on reform of the military - intelligence service , the WSI , which was certainly a rum outfit . But for many Poles , the issue pales in contrast to other problems . Signally , the government has failed in the fiddly but vital task of applying for and administering the euro60 billion ( $ 75 billion ) that Poland is due to receive from the EU from 2007 to 2013 . 
 That money -- contrary to what some Polish politicians seem to think -- does not come free . It is doled out only to properly drawn - up projects , where the home country is sharing at least a bit of the cost , and with audited results . Money misspent one year is clawed back the next . So far only the smallest and best - run countries , Estonia and Slovenia , have learned what to do . 
 The Kaczynskis ' one real advantage was a reputation for integrity . Like many ex - dissidents in power , they made up in honesty and patriotism what they lacked in political savvy or experience . But a new scandal has dented that . Covertly recorded videos showed their party 's representatives trying to win over a deputy from the Self - Defence party . "" You want a senior position ? We 've got lots , "" says a prime ministerial envoy . He also offers to "" sort out "" the deputy 's legal problems . 
 Jaroslaw Kaczynski is again trying to put a new coalition together . Early elections are still possible . It is hard to see any strong and sensible government emerging . 
 The wages of lies 
 In Hungary , the government has also seen its credibility collapsing -- though it arguably had less to start with . Whereas Poland 's politics are buffered by strong growth and fairly sound finances , Hungary 's are aggravated by the consequences of five years of spendthrift rule . 
 Ferenc Gyurcsany was caught on tape telling party colleagues that Ferenc Gyurcsany's government , re - elected in June this year , had lied , screwed up and done nothing . That led to an eruption of public anger , and big losses in local elections this month . Ferenc Gyurcsany hung on -- but this weekend another tape leaked , on which Ferenc Gyurcsany's local government minister , Monika Lamperth , can be heard assuring party chieftains that planned spending cuts will spare Socialist - controlled regions . 
 The opposition , led by the mercurial and opportunistic Viktor Orban , is little better . Its election campaign was as nonsensical and populist as the slippery ex - communists it affects to despise . Mr Orban and his colleagues seem to have a worryingly soft spot for the racists and ultra - nationalists who took part , sometimes violently , in last month 's demonstrations . 
 Yet Hungary is crying out for good government . Once the reform star of the post - communist world , it is awash with debt , with a government deficit now revealed to be over 10 % of GDP -- by far the highest in Europe , and more than twice what the government was admitting at the time of the election . Amid the smell of cooked books , foreign investors ' confidence has shrivelled . A run on the Hungarian currency , the forint , would mean default and devaluation : a national humiliation , and a disaster for the millions of Hungarians who have borrowed euros and Swiss francs to pay for houses and consumer durables .

The Hungarian uprising has inspired a new generation of books
ANYONE puzzled by the recent violence in Budapest, the worst since the failed revolution of 1956, should look at the plaque concealed behind a curtain in a building on Republic Square. Once the headquarters of the Communist Party, it now houses the communists' successors, the ruling socialists, who are led by the youthful multi-millionaire and prime minister Ferenc Gyurcsany. The plaque commemorates victims of 1956: not those killed fighting Soviet tanks or hanged after the revolution was crushed. Rather, it venerates the communist functionaries who were beaten, lynched and set on fire when the rebels captured the building. 
Looking at the powerful photographs in Erich Lessing's book, it seems as if what happened in Budapest was less an uprising against the Soviets than a civil war. His pictures show the corpses laid out in a row, covered with pictures of Hungary's hated dictator, Matyas Rakosi. Mr Lessing's work also illustrates how surreal urban warfare can be. During the worst of the fighting everyday life continued: housewives shopping for food delicately stepped around dead Soviet troops, passers-by stopped to watch an insurgent reload his rifle. 
If Mr Lessing shows what the uprising looked like, Viktor Sebestyen, Charles Gati and Michael Korda seek to explain its causes and its course. All have excellent credentials: Mr Sebestyen is a British journalist of Hungarian origin; Mr Gati, also a native Hungarian, witnessed the revolution at first hand before fleeing west. Mr Korda, nephew of the more famous Alexander, a film-maker, drove to Budapest from Oxford University, bringing a car-load of medicines. His lively eyewitness account recalls the chaos and excitement of revolutionary Budapest. 
Mr Sebestyen's book should become the standard work on the uprising. His early chapters set the scene and he is especially strong on the terror of the early 1950s, the Rakosi era that helped trigger the events. Politics in Stalinist Hungary operated a revolving door: officials were beaten near to death one day, returned to power another, dragged back to the prison cell the next. Mr Sebestyen uses multiple points of view to bring added perspectives from both Moscow and Washington, DC. Deft portraits of major characters--the tragic Imre Nagy, the duplicitous Janos Kadar and Yuri Andropov, the chilling Soviet ambassador to Budapest--bring the human drama alive and make for a gripping read.
""Failed Illusions"" sheds new light on American policy, especially the controversial role of Radio Free Europe as it encouraged the rebels. Published by Stanford University Press as part of the Cold War International History Project, the book draws heavily on newly declassified archives in Budapest, Moscow and America, and extensive interviews by the author.
Mr Gati is strong on Nagy, the leader of the doomed revolution. The nationalist right in Hungary has sought to appropriate Nagy as an anti-communist figurehead, But as both Mr Sebestyen and Mr Gati show, Nagy was as much a communist as he was a Hungarian patriot. Nagy's dithering in the early days of the fighting, hiscontinuing loyalty to the Soviet Union, hisinability to break out of the Marxist mindset and move decisively helped seal the fate of the revolution. Yet perhaps that is not so surprising: Mr Gati tells in detail how, in Moscow during the 1930s, Nagy became an NKVD informant known as Agent Volodya. Mr Gati's excellentfootnotes, several quite personal andpoignant, give added depth to the story. 
In the end, Nagy acquitted himself, at least in history's eyes, at his show trial before his execution in 1958. He neither submitted nor confessed and his courage made clear the dark farce of communist justice. The man who decided Nagy would die was Janos Kadar, his former comrade and Hungary's leader from 1956 until1988. Roger Gough's admirable life ofKadar, aptly entitled ""A Good Comrade"", untangles many of the contradictions around his life. 
Mr Gough skilfully traces Kadar's development from illegitimate child of a poor countrywoman to idealistic young worker to cynical apparatchik. Yet Kadar invented ""goulash communism"", turning Leninist logic on its head by proclaiming ""All those who are not against us are with us."" It worked, after a fashion, and Hungary was the most peaceful, prosperous nation in the Communist bloc. As for the old party headquarters on Republic Square, Socialist officials whisper that they plan to demolish it soon, sensitive plaque and all. Even that may not be enough to banish the ghosts of JanosKadar and his old comrade Imre Nagy.

HISTORY is perhaps on their side after all. At their annual conference next month, delegates from 70-odd Communist parties will be in a buoyant mood. Memories of Soviet crimes are fading, America's stock is falling and the injustices of global capitalism make an increasingly easy target. Communists always had good songs. Their political tunes of justice and solidarity may still sound hollow to some, but they now resonate more widely. 
The comrades' label has become remarkably elastic. Some retain both a monopoly of power and a belief in socialism (eg, Cuba); some are dictatorial, but enthusiastic capitalists (China, Vietnam). Those that had a monopoly of power but lost it sometimes stay true to old beliefs (like the Czech party). Others have kept the name but dumped everything else (Moldova's Communists, uniquely for eastern Europe, regained power through the ballot box, promised to create another Cuba, and then turned pro-Europe and anti-Kremlin). 
Another group spent much of their lives as the persecuted opposition to an undemocratic regime, and retain an aura of heroism as they operate out in the open (South Africa, Iraq). Lastly come those who have simply won a share of power in an established democracy (Italy, India).
Without a Soviet Union to act as ideological enforcer, the communist tribe is more scattered than ever, and differences matter much less. Boundaries that were once stark are now fuzzy. India's once-warring Communist parties are now electoral allies and coalition partners. Babis Angourakis, the international officer of Greece's party, the KKE, says that origins are no longer an issue: any party ""still fighting for a socialist transformation of society and defending the proletarian revolution described by Marx, Engels and Lenin"" is welcome at the annual gatherings that his party launched in 1998. Eurocommunists can rub shoulders with Stalinists who would once have called them traitors; even different brands of Maoists turn up, ranging from the Chinese party to former admirers of Albania's Enver Hoxha.
Friendship has its limits. Nepal's Maoists, who have taken power in large parts of the country after a lengthy rebellion, have little to do with their nominal mentors in China. They will not be present at this year's get-together; other parties view their armed struggle with distaste. 
One difficulty is which model to defend. Almost all communists praise Cuba, the last outpost of what was once the Soviet empire. But North Korea's bizarre mixture of personality cult and paranoia is a harder sell: most defend it as a victim of American imperialism; only a small minority insist that it is a workers' paradise. The world's biggest communist country, China, looks like the sort of society Marx criticised, not the one that he wanted to create. Libero Della Piana, the national organiser of America's Communist Party, says dryly that the Chinese enthusiasm for profit ""is a source of discussion in the world movement"".
But the biggest problem, history, is no longer such a vote-loser. Many who lived in their shadow may regard the hammer and sickle as akin to the swastika, but elsewhere communism prompts not revulsion but an attractive frisson of naughtiness. It is a good way of annoying conservatives, Atlanticists and plutocrats. European communists such as Mr Angourakis are cock-a-hoop about their success in blunting an attempt by the centre-right parties in the European Parliament last year to equate communism with Nazism. 
No more tradition's chains shall bind us
In much of the former Soviet empire, relabelled former communists plus their intelligence officers and other henchmen hold power. The Hungarian prime minister, Ferenc Gyurcsany, infuriates his anti-communist opponents (who boycotted this week's official commemoration of the 1956 uprising) with his close family ties to the old Soviet-installed regime. Nobody else seems to care.
Some of that hold on power is fuelled by communist slush funds adeptly recycled into capitalist business. Hundreds of millions of dollars of such money have been flooding into Romania and Bulgaria as they prepare to join the European Union. ""They're not stupid, these guys"", says one Balkan security official. ""They got the money out to Austria before they lost power. And now they are sure that it will be a safe investment here, they are bringing it back again.""
The most spectacular example of the erosion of the anti-communist taboo is in Italy, historically the home of the most powerful communists in an advanced economy. No fewer than three parties with communist roots are part of Romano Prodi's left-of-centre government. Giorgio Napolitano, Italy's president, and Massimo D'Alema, the foreign minister, were both leading members of the old Italian Communist Party. 
Its Eurocommunist members mostly re-emerged as the Democrats of the Left, the biggest party in Mr Prodi's coalition. But two groups of hardliners are also in the government. Communist Refoundation, the bigger of the two, got its best result for years in the parliamentary election in April, 7.2% in the election to the Senate, giving it 27 seats out of 315. Its leader, Fausto Bertinotti, is a strikingly patrician figure (a habitual feature of Italian proletarianism). He successfully appealed to a generally leftist constituency of pacifists, anti-globalisers and gay and lesbian campaigners. The party's most flamboyant lawmaker is a transvestite actor and singer. All very different from the puritan spirit of traditional communism.
The Refounded Communists have muscles to flex. Mr Bertinotti took from the Democrats of the Left the speakership of the lower house, a post that brings prestige and influence over the parliamentary timetable. Italy's tax-and-spend budget shows his influence, as does the halt to privatisation, which would have hurt his core constituency of public-sector employees.
In South Africa, by contrast, leading members of the Communist Party have turned into stern fiscal conservatives in the African National Congress-led government. But the rank and file, often active in the trade-union movement, is blocking labour-market reform, and chafing at an orthodox economic policy that it sees as too harsh on the poor and unemployed. The party is threatening to stand on its own in future elections, an option that would look more realistic if the ANC were to split.
India's two Communist parties are more powerful and more contradictory. Both use communist symbolism, but in practice support the mixed economy and rule of law. Their nationwide appeal means that they are an important electoral force at national level; their block of 50-odd seats forms a key part of the governing coalition led by the Congress party. They also run three states: Kerala, Tripura and West Bengal. This latter state has been ruled by the Communist Party of India (Marxist) for 29 years, with a remarkable mixture of strong party discipline and ruthless electoral tactics. Traditional left-wing policies such as land reform have now been supplemented under the state's chief minister, Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee, by a keen search for foreign investment, and support for privatisation--ideas that the party shuns at a national level. 
Solid pragmatism in south Asia does little to excite the comrades in the wider world. Mr Angourakis reserves his greatest enthusiasm for the onward march of radical leftism in South America. In Nicaragua, Daniel Ortega, once a hardline leader of the Soviet-backed Sandinista regime, is the favourite in the presidential election on November 5th. Venezuela's Hugo Chavez calls himself a ""21st century socialist"" but is adored by communists round the world, and returns the favour with subsidies for Cuba and comrades elsewhere in Latin America, especially Nicaragua. 
Mr Angourakis says prospects are at their brightest since the ""collapse"" of 1991. The fate of hundreds of millions of people has worsened since the ""counter-revolution"" of that year, he says. Now the failure of ""imperialist wars"" in Afghanistan and Iraq creates new opportunities.
Hang on--the Iraqi and Afghan Communist parties were among the most determined foes of Saddam Hussein and the Taliban respectively; America's invasion has put the Iraqi Communists in government. But on another point, most communists are clear; they eschew any alliance with jihadism or Islamic fundamentalism. Such opportunism, says one true believer disdainfully, is only for Trotskyists.
Caption: Give me that old-time religion","Fifty years after the crushing of the Hungarian uprising , communism is thriving 
 HISTORY is perhaps on their side after all . At their annual conference next month , delegates from 70 - odd Communist parties will be in a buoyant mood . Memories of Soviet crimes are fading , America 's stock is falling and the injustices of global capitalism make an increasingly easy target . Communists always had good songs . Their political tunes of justice and solidarity may still sound hollow to some , but they now resonate more widely . 
 The comrades ' label has become remarkably elastic . Some retain both a monopoly of power and a belief in socialism ( eg , Cuba ) ; some are dictatorial , but enthusiastic capitalists ( China , Vietnam ) . Those that had a monopoly of power but lost it sometimes stay true to old beliefs ( like the Czech party ) . Others have kept the name but dumped everything else ( Moldova 's Communists , uniquely for eastern Europe , regained power through the ballot box , promised to create another Cuba , and then turned pro - Europe and anti - Kremlin ) . 
 Another group spent much of their lives as the persecuted opposition to an undemocratic regime , and retain an aura of heroism as they operate out in the open ( South Africa , Iraq ) . Lastly come those who have simply won a share of power in an established democracy ( Italy , India ) . 
 Without a Soviet Union to act as ideological enforcer , the communist tribe is more scattered than ever , and differences matter much less . Boundaries that were once stark are now fuzzy . India 's once - warring Communist parties are now electoral allies and coalition partners . Babis Angourakis , the international officer of Greece 's party , the KKE , says that origins are no longer an issue : any party "" still fighting for a socialist transformation of society and defending the proletarian revolution described by Marx , Engels and Lenin "" is welcome at the annual gatherings that his party launched in 1998 . Eurocommunists can rub shoulders with Stalinists who would once have called them traitors ; even different brands of Maoists turn up , ranging from the Chinese party to former admirers of Albania 's Enver Hoxha . 
 Friendship has its limits . Nepal 's Maoists , who have taken power in large parts of the country after a lengthy rebellion , have little to do with their nominal mentors in China . They will not be present at this year 's get - together ; other parties view their armed struggle with distaste . 
 One difficulty is which model to defend . Almost all communists praise Cuba , the last outpost of what was once the Soviet empire . But North Korea 's bizarre mixture of personality cult and paranoia is a harder sell : most defend it as a victim of American imperialism ; only a small minority insist that it is a workers ' paradise . The world 's biggest communist country , China , looks like the sort of society Marx criticised , not the one that he wanted to create . Libero Della Piana , the national organiser of America 's Communist Party , says dryly that the Chinese enthusiasm for profit "" is a source of discussion in the world movement "" . 
 But the biggest problem , history , is no longer such a vote - loser . Many who lived in their shadow may regard the hammer and sickle as akin to the swastika , but elsewhere communism prompts not revulsion but an attractive frisson of naughtiness . It is a good way of annoying conservatives , Atlanticists and plutocrats . European communists such as Mr Angourakis are cock - a - hoop about their success in blunting an attempt by the centre - right parties in the European Parliament last year to equate communism with Nazism . 
 No more tradition 's chains shall bind us 
 In much of the former Soviet empire , relabelled former communists plus their intelligence officers and other henchmen hold power . Ferenc Gyurcsany infuriates Ferenc Gyurcsany's anti - communist opponents ( who boycotted this week 's official commemoration of the 1956 uprising ) with Ferenc Gyurcsany's close family ties to the old Soviet - installed regime . Nobody else seems to care . 
 Some of that hold on power is fuelled by communist slush funds adeptly recycled into capitalist business . Hundreds of millions of dollars of such money have been flooding into Romania and Bulgaria as they prepare to join the European Union . "" They 're not stupid , these guys "" , says one Balkan security official . "" They got the money out to Austria before they lost power . And now they are sure that it will be a safe investment here , they are bringing it back again . "" 
 The most spectacular example of the erosion of the anti - communist taboo is in Italy , historically the home of the most powerful communists in an advanced economy . No fewer than three parties with communist roots are part of Romano Prodi 's left - of - centre government . Giorgio Napolitano , Italy 's president , and Massimo D'Alema , the foreign minister , were both leading members of the old Italian Communist Party . 
 Its Eurocommunist members mostly re - emerged as the Democrats of the Left , the biggest party in Mr Prodi 's coalition . But two groups of hardliners are also in the government . Communist Refoundation , the bigger of the two , got its best result for years in the parliamentary election in April , 7.2 % in the election to the Senate , giving it 27 seats out of 315 . Its leader , Fausto Bertinotti , is a strikingly patrician figure ( a habitual feature of Italian proletarianism ) . He successfully appealed to a generally leftist constituency of pacifists , anti - globalisers and gay and lesbian campaigners . The party 's most flamboyant lawmaker is a transvestite actor and singer . All very different from the puritan spirit of traditional communism . 
 The Refounded Communists have muscles to flex . Mr Bertinotti took from the Democrats of the Left the speakership of the lower house , a post that brings prestige and influence over the parliamentary timetable .

RUSSIA'S president, Vladimir Putin, must be feeling smug. His strategy of using the country's vast natural resources to restore the greatness lost after the break-up of the Soviet Union seems to be paying off. If power is measured by the fear instilled in others--as many Russians believe--he is certainly winning.
The Soviet Union relied on its military machine for geopolitical power: its oil and gas were just a way to pay for it. In today's Russia, energy is itself the tool of influence. To use it the Kremlin needs three things: control over Russian energy reserves and production, control over the pipelines snaking across its territory and that of its neighbours, and long-term contracts with European customers that are hard to break. All three are in place. For all the talk of a common strategy towards Russia, the EU is divided and stuck for an answer.
Gazprom, Russia's energy giant, cherished by Mr Putin as a ""powerful lever of economic and political influence in the world"", has long-term supply contracts with most European countries, including France, Germany, Italy and Austria. It also has direct access to these countries' domestic markets. The EU reckons that half its gas imports now come from Russia. Newer EU members, such as Hungary and the Czech Republic, are almost entirely dependent on Russian gas. Moreover, a pipeline network that it inherited from the Soviet Union gives Russia control over gas imported from Central Asia.
The EU has few ideas for how to deal with its chief energy supplier. ""We know we should do something about Russia, but we don't know what,"" one Brussels official says. ""In the EU we negotiate on the rules, whereas Russia wants to do deals."" The deals are coming thick and fast. Last month, Russia secured one to build an oil pipeline from Bulgaria to Greece that will bypass the Bosporus. Symbolically, it will be the first Russian-controlled pipeline on EU territory. The pipeline will carry Russian and Central Asian oil straight to the EU, avoiding Turkey.
Oil can at least be bought from elsewhere. The bigger worry is about the EU's dependence on Russian gas. The flow of natural gas depends on the routes and control of pipelines, as European consumers were reminded when Russia switched off the gas supply to Ukraine just over a year ago and Ukraine started to steal Russian gas that was destined for the EU. Russia's pipeline routes encircle the EU from the north and south.
Russia and Germany have teamed up to build a gas pipeline under the Baltic Sea, bypassing Ukraine and Poland (see map on next page). Gerhard Schroder, a former German chancellor signed up by Mr Putin to preside over this Nord Stream pipeline, claims that it will make Europe safer. But a study by Sweden's Defence Research Agency concludes that it will divide the EU and increase dependence on Russia. It will let the Kremlin turn off gas supplies to Ukraine, Poland and Belarus without affecting ""more important"" customers. Understandably, Poland is anxious. The pipeline will increase the flow of gas to Germany and hook in countries that do not yet consume much Russian gas, including the Netherlands and Britain.
In the south, Russia has a pipeline across the Black Sea which supplies gas to Turkey. Now Russia wants to extend this Blue Stream pipeline to Hungary. That would compete directly with Europe's own plan to build a pipeline called Nabucco from Turkey to Austria. Nabucco has been one of the EU's few concerted responses to Russian domination of its gas supplies: it would be filled up with gas from Central Asia and thus bypass Russia altogether. But it is now creating more friction than unity.
Hungarian rhapsody
Last month Hungary's prime minister, Ferenc Gyurcsany, called Nabucco a ""long dream"". Instead, he suggested that Hungary would support the extension of Blue Stream. Gazprom already supplies 80% of Hungary's gas and has promised to build a large gas-storage facility that could be a hub for central Europe. ""Blue Stream"", enthused Mr Gyurcsany, ""is backed by a very strong will and a very strong organisational power."" (When Hungary was accused of undermining the EU's common energy policy, the tart response was that it was impossible to undermine something that did not exist.)
As well as controlling pipelines, Gazprom has also been busy buying up pieces of Europe's gas infrastructure. It owns 35% of Wingas, a German distribution company, and also has stakes in the Baltic countries' distributors. It has 10% of the interconnector pipeline between Belgium and Britain and wants a similar share of a British-Dutch link. It is also muscling its way into electricity, oil and liquefied natural gas (LNG) projects. ""It is not enough for us to meet 25% of global gas consumption. We want to be the biggest energy company in the world,"" Alexander Medvedev, Gazprom's deputy head, has said of his company's modest ambition.
Most European governments have been careful not to alienate Russia. As long as Gazprom plays by the rules, they say, it should be allowed to invest in their markets. Belgium recently said it had no problems with Gazprom owning parts of its infrastructure. Russia, in contrast, has a big problem with foreign companies owning, let alone controlling, any of its natural resources. It has bullied Royal Dutch Shell into ceding control of the Sakhalin-2 project in the far east of the country; it has blocked BP's plan to develop a gas field in eastern Siberia; and it has kept foreign companies out of the development of the giant Shtokman field in the Barents Sea, saying that it will go it alone.
In the same spirit, the Kremlin has flatly ruled out ratifying the EU's energy-charter treaty, which would require it to open up its gas pipelines to other countries and other suppliers. The Russians have made a mockery of a joint declaration on energy issued at the G8 summit they chaired in St Petersburg last July. The declaration called for more honesty, competition and transparency. Yet just two days later, Mr Putin enshrined into law Gazprom's monopoly position as the sole exporter of gas.
Then there is the talk of creating a gas equivalent to the OPEC oil-exporters' cartel. On April 9th Russia joined other gas producers in Qatar to discuss the possibility, and offered to lead a study into gas pricing. The next meeting of the group will be in Moscow. With almost 60% of the world's gas concentrated in just three countries --Russia, Iran and Qatar--the notion of a cartel sounds appealing. But fixing prices for a commodity that is not traded on world markets will prove much harder than it has been for oil. Even so, as Mr Putin said earlier this year, ""it would be a good idea to co-ordinate our activities.""
Gazprom has already signed a memorandum of understanding with Algeria's Sonatrach to co-operate in gas production. This has unnerved European consumers, as Algeria is their third-largest supplier of gas, after Russia and Norway. America, too, is nervous. ""Russia's commercial and political shadow over the governments in central Europe makes it harder for us to deal with our allies,"" says a senior State Department official.
The EU's dependence on Russian energy is hardly new. Nor is tension between Russia and America. ""The Americans were constantly telling us we were too dependent on Russian gas in the 1970s and 1980s,"" says Sir Rodric Braithwaite, a former British ambassador to Moscow. Yet, throughout the cold war, Russia remained a reliable gas supplier. Why should things be different now?
First, says, Cliff Kupchan, director of the Russian programme at Eurasia Group, a consultancy in Washington, DC, the Soviet Union was politically more predictable than its successor. ""It was run by geriatrics, but we knew that one geriatric would succeed another."" Russia's political stability is ephemeral. It relies on Mr Putin's will, not on an institutional transfer of power. With nationalism on the rise, it is anybody's guess who will be in charge of Russia in ten years' time.
A second difference is that the energy relationship between the Soviet Union and the West stopped at the border--albeit the border of the Soviet block. The oil and gas ministry, Gazprom's predecessor, did not try to take over any of western Europe's infrastructure. Gazprom has no scruples about using its muscle to buy such assets. Gazprom's desire to control their pipelines has been central to Russia's recent clashes with Ukraine and Belarus.
Third, the Soviet energy business was run by technocrats who implemented centrally planned decisions. Today, it is controlled by former KGB men obsessed with money and power. Gazprom has several ex-KGB members on its board of directors. Rosneft, the state-controlled oil champion, is chaired by a former agent who is now deputy chief of the Kremlin staff. ""People in Europe have a natural apprehension about their homes being heated by these people,"" says one commentator on Russia.
Yet dependence cuts both ways. Europe may depend on Russia for half its gas imports, but Russia is dependent on Europe for the bulk of its export revenues. Repeated threats by the Kremlin to divert the flow of gas to China mean little without pipelines that it would take many years to build. Switching off gas to Europe will never make commercial sense for Gazprom. The fear in some EU countries is that commercial interests may one day become secondary to political ones. Of 55 cut-offs, explicit threats or coercive price actions by Russia since 1991, only 11 had no political underpinnings, according to the Swedish defence study.
Running on empty
If all this is not worrying enough, there is another, more immediate source of concern for the EU: that Russia may be physically unable to produce enough gas to satisfy demand. Even worse than being dependent on a company like Gazprom may be to be dependent on a Gazprom that is short of gas.
The output of Gazprom's three super-giant fields, which account for three-quarters of its production, is declining at a rate of some 6-7% a year. Output from a new gas field brought on stream in 2001 has already peaked. Last year, Gazprom decided to develop a massive field in the Yamal peninsula--frozen and barren Arctic land--but that will take years. Meanwhile, Russia's domestic demand for gas is growing by more than 2% a year. For all its swagger, Russia is short of gas, a problem that is already affecting its electricity-generation capacity. This does not reflect any lack of reserves--Russia has the world's biggest--but rather a longstanding failure to invest enough in their development.
Gazprom has argued that it will invest in new fields only if it can pre-sell the output to Europe. Instead it has been spending lavishly on pipelines and downstream assets. This has a certain monopolistic logic. Raking in the middleman's profits from exports is easier and more lucrative than investing billions in developing new fields for a domestic market which, although it consumes two-thirds of Gazprom's production, generates hardly any profits, as regulated Russian gas prices are much lower than most European ones.
Meanwhile, Gazprom relies on Central Asia, especially Turkmenistan, to plug the gap in gas supplies, which makes many investors and consumers nervous. A study by UBS, a bank, concludes that Turkmenistan may have signed contracts to supply twice as much gas after 2009 as it can actually produce. The nervousness over potential shortages of gas, though, plays in Gazprom's favour: as with talk of a gas OPEC, it prods the Europeans into striking special deals with Gazprom.
Gazprom's position is reliant on support from Europe's national energy champions such as Gaz de France, ENI of Italy and Ruhrgas of Germany. Companies such as Ruhrgas and Gazprom have each other's interests at heart. Indeed, Ruhrgas owns about 7% of Gazprom, worth some $17 billion,and has a seat on Gazprom's board. ENI and Enel of Italy this month acted directly for Gazprom when they bought the expropriated gas assets of the bankrupt Yukos company in a controversial auction. Under a pre-arranged deal, the two Italian companies agreed to cede control of these assets to Gazprom, which was too cautious to bid in its own name. In return ENI and Enel were given a foothold in Russia's gas fields and possibly a seat on the board of Gazprom's oil company. Gazprom also has long-term gas contracts with ENI, which gives it direct access to Italian consumers.
Gazprom has similar arrangements in Germany and France. Vladimir Milov, the head of the Institute of Energy Policy in Moscow, says that the links between Gazprom and its European counterparts amount to a cartel between wholesale buyers and sellers. The losers in this game are European consumers who are forced to pay gas prices that are several times higher than the wholesale price which their national companies pay to Gazprom.
Trying to persuade Russia to break up Gazprom's monopoly is a futile task. The best way to increase the EU's energy security would be for it to liberalise its own market and unbundle its national utilities. This would cut profit margins in gas distribution, and thereby reduce Gazprom's appetite for European domestic assets. It would encourage European network operators to invest in interconnectors between electricity grids and pipeline networks, weakening Russia's ability to play off one customer against another. No wonder Gazprom does not warm to the idea of European energy liberalisation, which it has called ""the most absurd idea in the history of the world economy"".
Break it up
The European Commission has been urging EU members to break up their vertically integrated energy companies, but France and Germany are resisting. The problem, says the commission, is that national governments do not understand the link between liberalisation and greater energy security. ""New member states equate security with nationalism. But the only alternative to integration is isolation,"" says one senior EU official.
At the most recent EU summit in Brussels, heads of governments pledged to separate their energy supply and production activities from transport networks, which will be managed independently. This falls short of an ownership break-up but it should increase competition. EU leaders accepted the need to link their energy networks, allowing more cross-border trade and thus both boosting competition and reducing Gazprom's power. Europe is also talking of building more LNG terminals that can be stocked by other suppliers.
The EU's imports of LNG will certainly rise in coming years. The International Energy Agency (IEA) estimates that European imports of gas from Africa and the Middle East, mainly in the form of LNG, will quadruple by 2030. But LNG is expensive, and generally involves inflexible long-term sales contracts. Moreover, the IEA's projections assume that the Europeans overcome their squeamishness about building ugly LNG terminals. Equally improbably, they assume that Russia will not find some way to impede the emergence of rival exporters.
Getting direct access to Central Asian and Caspian gas is vital to European energy security. The Russians are well aware of this, as are the Americans, who have been active in the region and brokered the deal to build the twin oil and gas pipelines that now run from Azerbaijan to Turkey via Georgia. The Americans would like this gas to be carried on from Turkey to central Europe via the Nabucco pipeline, rather than the extension of Blue Stream.
But Azerbaijan's resources are not enough to make a material difference to European energy security. The big strategic battle now will be over gas-rich Central Asia.The Americans have revived their old plans to build a trans-Caspian pipeline and are actively courting the region's politicians, however dictatorial and disreputable. A change of government in Turkmenistan has given these efforts new impetus. But transporting Central Asian gas to the EU without Russian involvement will be testing. Apart from the unpalatable option of building a pipeline through Iran, the only way to get Turkmen gas to Europe would be across the bottom of the Caspian Sea. But a long unresolved dispute over the ownership of the Caspian between Iran, Kazakhstan, Azerbaijan and Russia makes this option explosive.
Russia has been jealously guarding its control over the Central Asian markets. It has more than doubled the price it pays for Turkmen gas and now claims to have a deal to buy all the gas the country can produce for the next 25 years. Last week Sergei Lavrov, Russia's foreign minister, went to Turkmenistan to promote ""close co-operation"", which means rejecting any American overtures. Russia cannot afford to lose control over gas exports from Central Asia because that would severely undermine its power over Europe.
The Kremlin's determination to keep a grip on their gas supplies should be an obvious worry for Europeans. But it could carry dangers for Russia too. If the EU ever manages to find an alternative to Russian energy, in the form of more LNG, Iranian gas, renewable energy or a pipeline under the Caspian, Russia would lose control of its key market. Even if it does not, the Russian economy will become ever more dependent on natural resources.
As Mr Putin contemplates a gas OPEC, he should remember that although the 1973 OPEC oil shock extended the life of the Soviet regime, it also left a Russian economy trailing behind its Western peers. ""Basing national power and prosperity on an inadequate monoculture is as risky as basing them on rockets in the cold war,"" argues Sir Rodric Braithwaite. Still, Russia's ability to cause harm to itself and to others in the cause of proving its greatness should never be underestimated.","The European Union is belatedly grasping the riskiness of its dependence on Russian gas , but it is disunited and short of ideas for how to reduce it

This has unnerved European consumers , as Algeria is their third - largest supplier of gas , after Russia and Norway . America , too , is nervous . "" Russia 's commercial and political shadow over the governments in central Europe makes it harder for us to deal with our allies , "" says a senior State Department official . 
 The EU 's dependence on Russian energy is hardly new . Nor is tension between Russia and America . "" The Americans were constantly telling us we were too dependent on Russian gas in the 1970s and 1980s , "" says Sir Rodric Braithwaite , a former British ambassador to Moscow . Yet , throughout the cold war , Russia remained a reliable gas supplier . Why should things be different now ? 
 First , says , Cliff Kupchan , director of the Russian programme at Eurasia Group , a consultancy in Washington , DC , the Soviet Union was politically more predictable than its successor . "" It was run by geriatrics , but we knew that one geriatric would succeed another . "" Russia 's political stability is ephemeral . It relies on Mr Putin 's will , not on an institutional transfer of power . With nationalism on the rise , it is anybody 's guess who will be in charge of Russia in ten years ' time . 
 A second difference is that the energy relationship between the Soviet Union and the West stopped at the border -- albeit the border of the Soviet block . The oil and gas ministry , Gazprom 's predecessor , did not try to take over any of western Europe 's infrastructure . Gazprom has no scruples about using its muscle to buy such assets . Gazprom 's desire to control their pipelines has been central to Russia 's recent clashes with Ukraine and Belarus . 
 Third , the Soviet energy business was run by technocrats who implemented centrally planned decisions . Today , it is controlled by former KGB men obsessed with money and power . Gazprom has several ex - KGB members on its board of directors . Rosneft , the state - controlled oil champion , is chaired by a former agent who is now deputy chief of the Kremlin staff . "" People in Europe have a natural apprehension about their homes being heated by these people , "" says one commentator on Russia . 
 Yet dependence cuts both ways . Europe may depend on Russia for half its gas imports , but Russia is dependent on Europe for the bulk of its export revenues . Repeated threats by the Kremlin to divert the flow of gas to China mean little without pipelines that it would take many years to build . Switching off gas to Europe will never make commercial sense for Gazprom . The fear in some EU countries is that commercial interests may one day become secondary to political ones . Of 55 cut - offs , explicit threats or coercive price actions by Russia since 1991 , only 11 had no political underpinnings , according to the Swedish defence study . 
 Running on empty 
 If all this is not worrying enough , there is another , more immediate source of concern for the EU : that Russia may be physically unable to produce enough gas to satisfy demand . Even worse than being dependent on a company like Gazprom may be to be dependent on a Gazprom that is short of gas . 
 The output of Gazprom 's three super - giant fields , which account for three - quarters of its production , is declining at a rate of some 6 - 7 % a year . Output from a new gas field brought on stream in 2001 has already peaked . Last year , Gazprom decided to develop a massive field in the Yamal peninsula -- frozen and barren Arctic land -- but that will take years . Meanwhile , Russia 's domestic demand for gas is growing by more than 2 % a year . For all its swagger , Russia is short of gas , a problem that is already affecting its electricity - generation capacity . This does not reflect any lack of reserves -- Russia has the world 's biggest -- but rather a longstanding failure to invest enough in their development . 
 Gazprom has argued that it will invest in new fields only if it can pre - sell the output to Europe . Instead it has been spending lavishly on pipelines and downstream assets . This has a certain monopolistic logic . Raking in the middleman 's profits from exports is easier and more lucrative than investing billions in developing new fields for a domestic market which , although it consumes two - thirds of Gazprom 's production , generates hardly any profits , as regulated Russian gas prices are much lower than most European ones . 
 Meanwhile , Gazprom relies on Central Asia , especially Turkmenistan , to plug the gap in gas supplies , which makes many investors and consumers nervous . A study by UBS , a bank , concludes that Turkmenistan may have signed contracts to supply twice as much gas after 2009 as it can actually produce . The nervousness over potential shortages of gas , though , plays in Gazprom 's favour : as with talk of a gas OPEC , it prods the Europeans into striking special deals with Gazprom . 
 Gazprom 's position is reliant on support from Europe 's national energy champions such as Gaz de France , ENI of Italy and Ruhrgas of Germany . Companies such as Ruhrgas and Gazprom have each other 's interests at heart . Indeed , Ruhrgas owns about 7 % of Gazprom , worth some $ 17 billion , and has a seat on Gazprom 's board . ENI and Enel of Italy this month acted directly for Gazprom when they bought the expropriated gas assets of the bankrupt Yukos company in a controversial auction . Under a pre - arranged deal , the two Italian companies agreed to cede control of these assets to Gazprom , which was too cautious to bid in its own name . In return ENI and Enel were given a foothold in Russia 's gas fields and possibly a seat on the board of Gazprom 's oil company . Gazprom also has long - term gas contracts with ENI , which gives it direct access to Italian consumers . 
 Gazprom has similar arrangements in Germany and France . Vladimir Milov , the head of the Institute of Energy Policy in Moscow , says that the links between Gazprom and its European counterparts amount to a cartel between wholesale buyers and sellers . The losers in this game are European consumers who are forced to pay gas prices that are several times higher than the wholesale price which their national companies pay to Gazprom . 
 Trying to persuade Russia to break up Gazprom 's monopoly is a futile task . The best way to increase the EU 's energy security would be for it to liberalise its own market and unbundle its national utilities . This would cut profit margins in gas distribution , and thereby reduce Gazprom 's appetite for European domestic assets . It would encourage European network operators to invest in interconnectors between electricity grids and pipeline networks , weakening Russia 's ability to play off one customer against another . No wonder Gazprom does not warm to the idea of European energy liberalisation , which it has called "" the most absurd idea in the history of the world economy "" . 
 Break it up 
 The European Commission has been urging EU members to break up their vertically integrated energy companies , but France and Germany are resisting . The problem , says the commission , is that national governments do not understand the link between liberalisation and greater energy security . "" New member states equate security with nationalism . But the only alternative to integration is isolation , "" says one senior EU official . 
 At the most recent EU summit in Brussels , heads of governments pledged to separate their energy supply and production activities from transport networks , which will be managed independently . This falls short of an ownership break - up but it should increase competition . EU leaders accepted the need to link their energy networks , allowing more cross - border trade and thus both boosting competition and reducing Gazprom 's power . Europe is also talking of building more LNG terminals that can be stocked by other suppliers . 
 The EU 's imports of LNG will certainly rise in coming years . The International Energy Agency ( IEA ) estimates that European imports of gas from Africa and the Middle East , mainly in the form of LNG , will quadruple by 2030 . But LNG is expensive , and generally involves inflexible long - term sales contracts . Moreover , the IEA 's projections assume that the Europeans overcome their squeamishness about building ugly LNG terminals . Equally improbably , they assume that Russia will not find some way to impede the emergence of rival exporters . 
 Getting direct access to Central Asian and Caspian gas is vital to European energy security . The Russians are well aware of this , as are the Americans , who have been active in the region and brokered the deal to build the twin oil and gas pipelines that now run from Azerbaijan to Turkey via Georgia . The Americans would like this gas to be carried on from Turkey to central Europe via the Nabucco pipeline , rather than the extension of Blue Stream . 
 But Azerbaijan 's resources are not enough to make a material difference to European energy security . The big strategic battle now will be over gas - rich Central Asia . The Americans have revived their old plans to build a trans - Caspian pipeline and are actively courting the region 's politicians , however dictatorial and disreputable . A change of government in Turkmenistan has given these efforts new impetus . But transporting Central Asian gas to the EU without Russian involvement will be testing . Apart from the unpalatable option of building a pipeline through Iran , the only way to get Turkmen gas to Europe would be across the bottom of the Caspian Sea . But a long unresolved dispute over the ownership of the Caspian between Iran , Kazakhstan , Azerbaijan and Russia makes this option explosive . 
 Russia has been jealously guarding its control over the Central Asian markets . It has more than doubled the price it pays for Turkmen gas and now claims to have a deal to buy all the gas the country can produce for the next 25 years . Last week Sergei Lavrov , Russia 's foreign minister , went to Turkmenistan to promote "" close co - operation "" , which means rejecting any American overtures . Russia can not afford to lose control over gas exports from Central Asia because that would severely undermine its power over Europe . 
 The Kremlin 's determination to keep a grip on their gas supplies should be an obvious worry for Europeans . But it could carry dangers for Russia too . If the EU ever manages to find an alternative to Russian energy , in the form of more LNG , Iranian gas , renewable energy or a pipeline under the Caspian , Russia would lose control of its key market . Even if it does not , the Russian economy will become ever more dependent on natural resources . 
 As Mr Putin contemplates a gas OPEC , he should remember that although the 1973 OPEC oil shock extended the life of the Soviet regime , it also left a Russian economy trailing behind its Western peers . "" Basing national power and prosperity on an inadequate monoculture is as risky as basing them on rockets in the cold war , "" argues Sir Rodric Braithwaite . Still , Russia 's ability to cause harm to itself and to others in the cause of proving its greatness should never be underestimated .",310,Hungary,A29-4567,IN TERM,True,"Hungary 's prime minister , Ferenc Gyurcsany ,",3,True

The justice minister, Jozsef Petretei, has resigned, as has the head of the domestic security service, Lajos Galambos.
The two police chiefs were dumped after scandals. Five police officers were detained after the alleged rape of a 21-year-old woman in Budapest, who said they had first demanded money and that one of them had then raped her and another forced her to perform oral sex, as the other three looked on. In another case, a police officer was convicted of robbing a bank after he was sent to deal with an armed robbery. And 13 traffic policemen have been charged with taking kickbacks from breakdown rescue services.
Confidence in the police force has plummeted. As so often, the authorities were reluctant to take the young woman's claims of rape seriously. ""Cries Unheard"", a recent report from Amnesty International, cited a Hungarian police adviser saying that 85% of women who claimed to be raped were ""whores"" who could not agree on a price. The report also quoted a female judge with 20 years' experience saying she would be reluctant to report it if she were raped: ""It is very difficult because of the procedures, the attitudes and social conventions. It is the victim who has to defend and prove everything.""
Human-rights groups say that Hungary's police have not been properly reformed since the collapse of communism. Less than 10% of reports of police violence filed to prosecutors lead to charges. Corruption is widespread, especially among traffic police. Many drivers can recount demands for on-the-spot payments that go straight into a policeman's pocket; drunk drivers can sometimes buy their freedom for only 20,000 forints ($110).
Andras Kadar, of the Hungarian Helsinki Committee, says there is a culture of impunity among police officers, who are loyal to each other and reluctant to investigate alleged wrongdoing. In April the European Court of Human Rights ruled against Hungary for not looking into claims made by a Briton of police brutality. The opposition Fidesz party has been calling for new leaders to head the police force since riots last autumn saw unprecedented police violence. Some 40 officers are under investigation for their role in those events. Fidesz is demanding a parliamentary investigation into the latest scandals.
Apologists argue that a new generation of officers is coming up through the ranks. Western advisers working with the police report progress against organised crime. The security services, with agents trained by Western experts in counter-terrorist techniques, are valued for their expertise in the Balkans. Yet that did not save Mr Galambos when spooks harassed a journalist investigating a new villa for Gyorgy Szilvasy, head of the prime minister's office; or when it emerged that officers were involved in a dodgy charity importing food from East Asia. According to the customs service, a rare institution untainted by scandal, the food was not donated, but sold. Tellingly, Jozsef Bencze, who is replacing Mr Bene as national police chief, comes from the customs service.","Efforts to clean up Hungary's police and security forces

OPTIMISTS hope that Valdis Zatlers, an orthopaedic surgeon, will grow into his new job as Latvia's president. But even his doughtiest supporters doubt that he will fill the exquisite shoes of his predecessor, Vaire Vike-Freiberga, a steely-minded emigre polyglot who ushered her small Baltic country into both the European Union and NATO.
Dr Zatlers was at least good at something: he admits collecting thousands of dollars in tips from grateful patients, on which he is now hurrying to pay tax. But he has no experience of statecraft or even of public life. His sole asset is the backing of Latvia's political chieftains, who foisted him on the country in a secret backroom deal. That may be unfortunate for Latvia. But the sadder aspect of the story is that the doctor fits so neatly into the region's increasingly dull political landscape.
Post-communist leaders were once big, internationally known figures. Lech Walesa of Poland and the Czech Republic's Vaclav Havel remain world famous. Poland's Aleksander Kwasniewski was widely admired abroad for his diplomatic skills. Reformist politicians such as Estonia's Mart Laar, Russia's Yegor Gaidar and Slovakia's Mikulas Dzurinda wowed the policy wonks with their zealous embrace of flat taxes and free-marketry.
Now things are different. Only two leaders really stand out: the presidents of Russia and Estonia. Russia's Vladimir Putin has many critics, but when he speaks, people listen. Estonia's president, the Swedish-born and American-educated Toomas Hendrik Ilves, now speaks up for all the Kremlin's former European satellites. The brainy Mr Ilves is the only senior politician in the region with real experience of Brussels (he was once a member of the European Parliament) and Washington, DC. He has the ear of George Bush: both are keen farmers (although on rather different scales), and both like the same make of Stihl brush-cutter.
Elsewhere, foreign statesmen find few weighty senior people to engage with. Ukraine's politicians are enmeshed in seemingly endless and exasperating clan warfare. Romania's president, Traian Basescu, is an ardent Atlanticist and European, but is bogged down in a spat with his country's old-guard government. Poland's ruling twins are refreshingly honest, but prickly and provincial. Vaclav Klaus of the Czech Republic enjoys talking but not listening. Mikhail Saakashvili of Georgia presides over rapid growth and reform, but even friends find that he is better when taken in small doses.
A lot more typical are such political leaders as Slovakia's prime minister, Robert Fico, or Hungary's Ferenc Gyurcsany: wily political operators with good business ties and a populist touch. They show little interest in restarting reforms or in foreign policy. Most other leaders in the region are either past it or a bit dull.
Yet central and eastern Europe desperately needs strong government to catch up with the continent's older democracies. Unreformed public services gobble money and produce poor outcomes. The demographic decline in prospect, especially in the poorest countries, is scary; emigration is now making it worse.
The Kremlin's habitual divide-and-rule tactics also tend to work best on weak, opportunist leaders. That may prove to be a problem in Latvia, where the country's business barons are unnervingly keen to show they can work with the Russians.
When western Europe was led by burnt-out leaders such as Jacques Chirac, Silvio Berlusconi and Gerhard Schroder, the contrast was less striking. But the arrival of Angela Merkel in Germany, Nicolas Sarkozy in France and (next week) Gordon Brown in Britain casts a harsh light on the steppe to the east. It would be nice if new impressive politicians were climbing the ladder there. Sadly, the antics of the current lot seem not to inspire energetic newcomers, but to deter them.","Few of Europe 's ex - communist countries have strong leaders

THESE should be halcyon days for Viktor Orban, leader of Fidesz, Hungary's main opposition party. Fidesz leads the ruling Socialists by 20 points in the polls. That is mainly because of the government's austerity measures, but also reflects aftershocks from the riots after a notorious speech by Ferenc Gyurcsany, the prime minister, over a year ago, in which he admitted to lying about the economy before the 2006 election.
Yet Fidesz is in disarray. Its new bugbear is the Magyar Garda (Hungarian Guard), a self-styled civil-defence group. The Garda, whose members wear black uniforms emblazoned with nationalist insignia, is organised by the far right Jobbik party. It was inaugurated last month by Lajos Fur, a former defence minister. Several churchmen attended, as did Maria Wittner, a veteran of the 1956 revolution--and a Fidesz member of parliament. The Garda has only 56 members, but plans for 2,000 more.
Most political parties have been quick to condemn it. ""Fascists are gathering,"" declared Mr Gyurcsany, accusing Fidesz of making common cause with Jobbik. Jobbik is not represented in parliament, but it co-operates with Fidesz in some localities. Fidesz's initial response was to defend the Garda's right of free association, and accuse Mr Gyurcsany of whipping up hysteria. Yet Jewish and Roma (gypsy) groups have called for action against the Garda. An American congressman, Tom Lantos, who is a Hungarian Holocaust survivor, has promised that no member would be let into the United States, and added that any party that fails to condemn the Garda cannot be a serious partner.
Here lies Mr Orban's dilemma. Fidesz's leaders have condemned anti-Semitism; it was Mr Orban's government in 2001 that instituted a Holocaust memorial day. The party's leaders have written to Hungary's Jewish leaders to reassure them. But Mr Orban also wants to court far-right votes. Although his lieutenants have now distanced Fidesz from the Garda, Mr Orban himself has refused to condemn it, beyond telling diplomats that it is the wrong answer to Hungary's problems. Such equivocation angers allies abroad: Fidesz has links with German Christian Democrats and wants ties with British Conservatives.
Direct support for the far right remains small, at only 2-3%. Yet similar parties are gaining elsewhere: one has just got into Greece's parliament. Activists in Hungary are newly confident. Masked skinheads disrupted a recent Budapest Gay Pride parade. Protesters dog Mr Gyurcsany, screaming abuse at him. Most analysts reckon that courting the far right has cost Fidesz support in the centre, helping it to lose in both 2002 and 2006. Mr Orban may again be the Socialists' best electoral asset.

FINANCIAL markets are jumpy about several east European countries. One of the more vulnerable is Hungary, notorious for its budget and current-account deficits. Once the local wonder child, Hungary is limping, its government outmanoeuvred by the opposition, its economy sclerotic and its population resentful. Earlier this month voters hammered the government in a referendum, when over 80% rejected charges for doctors' visits, hospital stays and tuition fees in higher education. The sums involved are small (300 forints, or some $2, for a doctor's appointment), but they still caused anger, pushing turnout over 50%.
Poverty and decades of state provision make Hungarians reluctant to pay again for services they already finance through taxes. The result was a triumph for Fidesz, the right-wing opposition party, which campaigned against the charges on a platform of patriotism and generous state provision. Fidesz cut deep into the ruling Socialists' voter base. Around 3.3m voters rejected the charges, almost 1m more than had voted for Fidesz in 2006.
The prime minister, Ferenc Gyurcsany, promised to scrap the charges, but added that no new funds would be available to make up for them. Other problems remain. Hungary has the heaviest tax burden in the region. Some 20% of workers pay four-fifths of income tax. Employers pay over 30% in social-security contributions, on top of taxes paid by employees, and the tax rules keep changing. Many Hungarians game the system: the black economy may account for 18% of GDP.
Foreign investment has fallen behind levels in neighbouring countries. A high-tax regime and an unstable business environment have caused a significant fall in reinvestment of profits, says Eszter Gargyan, an economist at Citigroup. As a result, Hungary now has the lowest growth in the European Union: just 1.3% in 2007. Unemployment is 8.1%. Romania and, even more humiliating, Slovakia, with their flat-tax regimes, look more attractive.
The next election is due in 2010. Fidesz's poll ratings are almost 40%, against some 15% for the Socialists. Mr Gyurcsany, a former communist youth leader turned multi-millionaire, has a year to turn round the economy--and with it his party's poll ratings. If he fails, he may be dumped. His reputation has never fully recovered from his confession to lying about Hungary's economic problems in 2006. Not all the news is bad: the budget deficit is likely to drop from 9.4% in 2006 to 5.6% in 2007, and it may fall again this year. But the referendum has dashed hopes of more reforms, and Fidesz has the initiative. The government may suspend plans to allow private health insurers into the state system.
In short, Hungary's politicians are doing what they do best: squabbling for short-term advantage, while leaving structural problems untouched.

Hungary will not get in before 2014 at the earliest.","Hungary may soon be overtaken by its neighbours 
 FINANCIAL markets are jumpy about several east European countries . One of the more vulnerable is Hungary , notorious for its budget and current - account deficits . Once the local wonder child , Hungary is limping , its government outmanoeuvred by the opposition , its economy sclerotic and its population resentful . Earlier this month voters hammered the government in a referendum , when over 80 % rejected charges for doctors ' visits , hospital stays and tuition fees in higher education . The sums involved are small ( 300 forints , or some $ 2 , for a doctor 's appointment ) , but they still caused anger , pushing turnout over 50 % . 
 Poverty and decades of state provision make Hungarians reluctant to pay again for services they already finance through taxes . The result was a triumph for Fidesz , the right - wing opposition party , which campaigned against the charges on a platform of patriotism and generous state provision . Fidesz cut deep into the ruling Socialists ' voter base . Around 3.3 m voters rejected the charges , almost 1 m more than had voted for Fidesz in 2006 . 
 The prime minister , Ferenc Gyurcsany , promised to scrap the charges , but added that no new funds would be available to make up for them . Other problems remain . Hungary has the heaviest tax burden in the region . Some 20 % of workers pay four - fifths of income tax . Employers pay over 30 % in social - security contributions , on top of taxes paid by employees , and the tax rules keep changing . Many Hungarians game the system : the black economy may account for 18 % of GDP . 
 Foreign investment has fallen behind levels in neighbouring countries . A high - tax regime and an unstable business environment have caused a significant fall in reinvestment of profits , says Eszter Gargyan , an economist at Citigroup . As a result , Hungary now has the lowest growth in the European Union : just 1.3 % in 2007 . Unemployment is 8.1 % . Romania and , even more humiliating , Slovakia , with their flat - tax regimes , look more attractive . 
 The next election is due in 2010 . Fidesz 's poll ratings are almost 40 % , against some 15 % for the Socialists . Ferenc Gyurcsany has a year to turn round the economy -- and with it Ferenc Gyurcsany's party 's poll ratings . If Ferenc Gyurcsany fails , Ferenc Gyurcsany may be dumped . Ferenc Gyurcsany's reputation has never fully recovered from Ferenc Gyurcsany's confession to lying about Hungary 's economic problems in 2006 . Not all the news is bad : the budget deficit is likely to drop from 9.4 % in 2006 to 5.6 % in 2007 , and it may fall again this year . But the referendum has dashed hopes of more reforms , and Fidesz has the initiative . The government may suspend plans to allow private health insurers into the state system . 
 In short , Hungary 's politicians are doing what they do best : squabbling for short - term advantage , while leaving structural problems untouched . As if to illustrate this , Slovakia , the one - time laggard turned reforming star , hopes to join the euro as soon as next year . Hungary will not get in before 2014 at the earliest .",310,Hungary,A29-4567,IN TERM,True,"Mr Gyurcsany , a former communist youth leader turned multi - millionaire ,",6,True

A WHIFF of cold-war menace hung over the European Union summit on March 1st. A ""new iron curtain"" threatens to divide rich western Europe from the east, declared Ferenc Gyurcsany, Hungary's prime minister, as he pleaded for a EUR 180 billion rescue plan for the countries of central and eastern Europe. Mr Gyurcsany had a second plea: for eastern countries to secure early membership of the single currency. Neither idea found favour.
Germany's Angela Merkel said aid should be given on a ""case by case"" basis, as eastern countries had ""very different"" needs. As for speeding up euro membership, she thought not, though newcomers might get faster entry into a scheme to peg currencies to the euro. The Poles, Slovaks and Czechs were also hostile to the Hungarian plan. Their economies are in better shape than debt-laden Hungary or credit-crunched Latvia, and they fear contagion from the belief that eastern Europe is uniformly troubled.
But there is another reason why Mr Gyurcsany's cold-war rhetoric failed to resonate: another period, the 1930s, haunts Europe even more. This year violent anti-government protests in Greece, Latvia, Bulgaria and Lithuania have spooked leaders across the EU. The European elections are in June. This time, extremists on right and left may do well--including in Hungary, home to some of Europe's least savoury political groups. Could 1930s economics lead Europe back to 1930s politics?
There are reasons to hope that liberal, multiparty democracy is in pretty good shape across the EU. For a start, everybody knows how the 1930s ended. Europe then was a more dangerous place: its poorest citizens were starving and welfare safety-nets were non-existent or inadequate. At times, Italians in Sardinia ate wild plants to survive. In Denmark unemployment topped 40%, and the government bought surplus cattle from desperate farmers. In 1933 almost-two thirds of Greek public spending went on servicing foreign debts, before the country defaulted. Equally, the first world war had left Europe with much unfinished business. Despite hyperinflation and punitive bills for reparations, Germany remained a big power, yearning to redraw its borders. Austria and Hungary were wounded ex-giants. Italy dreamt of controlling the Adriatic. The Soviet Union's rise sparked instability as far away as Spain.
Yet for all the differences, intriguing echoes from the 1930s can still be heard. It is not that bits of Europe are flirting with fascism again. It is rather that the same issues irk voters then as now--and politicians are responding to them in similar ways. Today's German and French governments talk loudly about clamping down on tax havens: this is a highly visible way to seek extra revenue and punish errant plutocrats. Almost 80 years ago, an identical outrage gripped Europe, when French police in 1932 raided the Paris offices of a Swiss bank for customer records, coming away with the names of French members of parliament, newspaper editors and a brace of bishops. (In a nice irony, the raid persuaded livid Swiss authorities to enshrine banking secrecy in law.)
Before the depression, France also had one of Europe's most open labour markets, home to millions of Poles, Czechs, Belgians, Italians, Spaniards and Swiss, plus impressive numbers of political refugees. But between 1932 and 1935, a string of laws and decrees set quotas on foreign workers and stopped them moving from job to job. Tens of thousands, mostly Poles, were eventually expelled by force. The middle classes also protected themselves: new laws closed the French medical and legal professions to foreign-born graduates, often Jewish refugees.
Today British tabloids rage about jobs for migrants, seizing on Gordon Brown's infamous phrase about creating ""British jobs for British workers"". Spain, which welcomed immigrants in boom times, is offering unemployed foreigners money to go home. Italy's Northern League wants a freeze on non-EU immigration and last year pushed for the expulsion of EU migrants without adequate means of support, a measure aimed at Roma, or gypsies, from Romania. The expulsion plan was dropped only because it fell foul of an EU directive on freedom of movement. Holding the line for liberalism
And therein lies the biggest reason to think that the 1930s will not be repeated. EU membership binds national politicians into a set of essentially liberal, free-trading, internationalist standards. 
It is true that competition rules and the freedoms of the single market are being sorely tested, as politicians try to steer rescue funds to domestic companies, banks and workers. But among EU leaders there is a consensus on the need to defend ""fundamental rights"". The EU can be expected to block blatantly discriminatory laws on housing, employment or schools. No hothead nationalist can close borders to a neighbour's goods. 
Governments can be taken to court or threatened with suspension. But the EU also operates by peer pressure. This can be pompous and ineffective, as in 2000, when European leaders shunned high-level contacts with Austrian politicians because Jorg Haider, a far-right politician, had joined the ruling coalition. That boycott fell apart when Austria's government was found to be sticking to mainstream policies. Or it can be brutal and effective: in 1998 the EU warned Slovaks not to re-elect Vladimir Meciar, a nasty nationalist, if they wanted to join the club.
Bad things could happen as this crisis deepens. In one nightmare, a fragile EU member could become a failed state. But the EU stands for international solidarity and interdependence. Its maddening complexity amounts to a permanent compromise between competing interests that also makes it a bulwark against extremism. That may not always make Brussels popular with voters. But it does make one thankful that the EU exists.author Charlemagne now writes a blog, which is open for comment at

Two men often mentioned are Gyorgy Suranyi, a former governor of the central bank who introduced an austerity package in the 1990s, and Ferenc Glatz, a former president of the Hungarian Academy of Science. Lajos Bokros, a reforming finance minister in the 1990s, may also be a contender.
Mr Gyurcsany, once hailed as a young moderniser, never really recovered from the riots that erupted in autumn 2006 after his confession that his government had lied repeatedly about the state of the economy. His timid attempts to cut Hungary's stifling tax burden have had little impact. This month the forint hit a record low, despite a $25 billion rescue package led by the International Monetary Fund. The unemployment rate has risen to 8.4%. The government forecasts that GDP will shrink by 3.5% this year; Capital Economics, a think-tank, predicts a fall of 7.5%.
Hungary remains hobbled by corruption (a cosy cartel, especially in local government, slices up European Union funds), a heavy burden of debt and a black economy that may account for one-fifth of GDP. Despite the crisis, a sense of unreality prevails. Nationalist intellectuals use the language of the 1930s to rail against foreign capital and ""cosmopolitan"" influences. Viktor Orban, leader of the opposition Fidesz party, laments that more than 80% of the financial system is ""in foreigners' hands"". Social tensions are rising, after a string of attacks on Hungary's Roma gypsies that followed two highly publicised murders allegedly perpetrated by Roma.
It is no surprise that Mr Gyurcsany's approval rating is barely 18%. Two-thirds of voters now back Fidesz, against 23% for the Socialists. Mr Orban has demanded an early election, calling the Socialists ""Hungary's disgrace"". Yet there may be less to Mr Gyurcsany's departure than meets the eye. A former communist youth leader turned multimillionaire, he is a wily operator. His resignation was choreographed, and he was swiftly re-elected as party chairman. The minority government depends on support from the liberal Free Democrats and pro-business Democratic Forum, neither of which wants an early poll. A new prime minister might let the Socialists say they were forced into unpopular spending cuts, leaving a rejuvenated Mr Gyurcsany to pull the strings behind the scenes.

Barack Obama said America's ""voracious"" economy should no longer be relied upon as the sole engine of global growth. 
At the summit Mr Obama held bilateral meetings with Hu Jintao, China's president, Manmohan Singh, India's prime minister, and Dmitry Medvedev, Russia's president, with whom Mr Obama discussed arms control. The American president was due to head to France and Germany for a summit marking NATO's 60th anniversary.
America's Justice Department asked that Ted Stevens's conviction for corruption be overturned. An investigation has begun into alleged misconduct by prosecutors in the case against the former Republican senator from Alaska. Fund things to do
Mexico's president, Felipe Calderon, said his government would accept an IMF offer of a flexible credit line of up to $47 billion. Mexico is the first to say that it will use the new facility, which has no strings attached but is only available to countries with policies the fund considers sound. 
The member countries of the Inter-American Development Bank (IDB) agreed to think about putting in more capital to enable it to expand its lending. The bank says its loans could total $18 billion this year, as governments seek to mitigate recession; it can only lend $8 billion a year without depleting its capital.
Manuel Rosales, the mayor of Maracaibo, Venezuela's second city, went into hiding. Mr Rosales was the defeated opposition candidate in the 2006 presidential election. He now faces possible arrest on corruption charges, which he asserts is a ""political lynching"". The government of Hugo Chavez says Mr Rosales should defend himself in court. 
A bipartisan group of American senators unveiled a bill, backed by business and human-rights groups, to lift the 47-year-old ban on Americans travelling to Cuba. A new surge
At a conference in The Hague, nearly 90 countries and organisations welcomed America's new strategy to deal with extremism in Afghanistan and Pakistan. This would combine more troops and aid with a more intense regional diplomatic effort. Iran said it would be ready to help.
Pakistan's police recaptured a police academy that had been taken over by terrorists in Lahore. The head of the Pakistan Taliban claimed responsibility and said it was in retaliation for an American drone attack. America sent another drone into Pakistan, reportedly killing 12 people. Earlier, a suicide-bomber killed scores of people at a mosque near the border with Afghanistan. 
Researchers at the University of Toronto said they had found that almost 1,300 government-owned computers in 103 countries had been infected by spyware and other secret eavesdropping devices. Their report said circumstantial evidence pointed to China as the culprit.
Varun Gandhi, a member of India's main political dynasty, was charged with attempted murder and rioting during the election campaign. Mr Gandhi had defected from the family's Congress party and was standing for the opposition Bharatiya Janata Party. Repeated offence
In Russia Mikhail Khodorkovsky, once boss of the Yukos oil company and avowed enemy of Vladimir Putin, went on trial for a second time. He is charged with embezzling Yukos's oil. The defence claimed the trial was political: without it, Mr Khodorkovsky would have been released in two years' time.
A Russian human-rights activist, Lev Ponomaryov, was beaten up in Moscow. The attack followed the killing of a human-rights lawyer, Stanislav Markelov, earlier this year.
A prominent Chechen, Sulim Yamadayev, was reportedly shot dead in Dubai. Mr Yamadayev had fallen out with Chechnya's president, Ramzan Kadyrov. He would be the fourth well-known opponent of Mr Kadyrov's to be killed since September.
Hungary's ruling Socialists picked Gordon Bajnai, the economy minister, to replace Ferenc Gyurcsany as prime minister. Mr Gyurcsany resigned on March 23rd.
The ruling Justice and Development Party did badly in Turkey's local elections, taking 39% of the vote compared with 47% in the 2007 general election. The prime minister, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, expressed disappointment but vowed to continue with reform. Bibi's back
Binyamin Netanyahu was installed as Israel's prime minister at the head of a coalition government. It includes an extreme nationalist party led by Avigdor Lieberman, who becomes foreign minister, and the Labour Party led by Ehud Barak, who becomes defence minister. 
It was reported that Israeli missiles had destroyed a convoy of lorries in north-east Sudan that were said to be carrying Iranian missiles bound for the Palestinian Hamas group in the Gaza Strip. The attack occurred in January, during Israel's three-week assault on Hamas.
Sunni Arabs belonging to militias known as the Sons of Iraq, who are drawn from former insurgents and now on the American payroll, clashed with units of the Shia-led Iraqi army in several districts of Baghdad after some of their leaders were arrested. Fears rose of a slide back into sectarian strife unless Iraqi authorities address the grievances of the Sons, some of whom have not been paid for months.
More than 200 African migrants trying to reach Europe were thought to have drowned off the coast of Libya. Hundreds of migrants have died in the past few months trying to cross the Mediterranean Sea in flimsy boats.
At a summit of the 22-country Arab League in Qatar, the Sudanese president, Omar al-Bashir, was warmly received, despite an international arrest warrant recently issued against him for alleged war crimes in his country's western region, Darfur.","Leaders from the G20 countries gathered in London for an ambitious summit to discuss , among other things , the world recession and reform of the IMF .

THANKS to a mix of luck and good decisions, the economic apocalypse that loomed over central and eastern Europe seems to have been averted. But dizzy current-account deficits, wild foreign-currency borrowing and reckless fiscal policy are leaving a horrible hangover for some. The IMF forecasts a 4.9% average fall in GDP, with far bigger falls for some. The European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) reckons on a 5.2% drop. The downturn is certainly nasty; but some changes have staved off the worst.
One change is that outsiders now assess risk more calmly and rationally. All the former planned economies remain capital-thirsty. But otherwise they are all different. Indeed, a rare common factor among 20-odd countries in the region with the ""ex-communist"" tag is that they dispute its relevance. Tarring all with the mistakes of overheated Latvia, chaotic Ukraine or debt-sodden Hungary makes no sense. Nor does lumping together rich and poor countries, or those in the European Union and those outside. Exchange-rate regimes vary: two countries are in the euro; five countries have pegged their currencies to it; others float. 
So far at least, speculators who counted on contagion toppling countries like dominoes have little to show for it, while those who bet the other way have juicy gains. Poland's stockmarket is up by nearly 40% since its low in February, Hungary's has risen by half and Russia's by nearly 90%.
Outside help is also now better co-ordinated. The previously standoffish IMF co-operates with the European Commission, national governments and the banks. Once seen as a lender of last resort, it now acts pre-emptively. In May it gave a $21 billion credit line to Poland, the biggest and strongest economy in the region. That is quite different, officials stress, from the emergency rescues of Belarus, Latvia, Hungary, Romania, Serbia and Ukraine.
The IMF is also behaving more gently. Ukraine was originally told to balance its budget this year. Now the IMF says a deficit of 4% of GDP is realistic; this month it released its latest $2.8 billion tranche. Officials are uneasy about insisting on fiscal tightening that may aggravate recession. Latvia is likely to be allowed to run a 7% deficit for this year--in return for promising, really and truly, to reach 4% in 2010.
A third change is that more aid has been given to western banks that face souring loans, typically to clients in Hungary and the Baltic states who borrowed in euros or Swiss francs. As outsiders cut back, a credit squeeze is threatening even healthy borrowers. A joint initiative by the EBRD, the World Bank and the European Investment Bank (which used to lend only to state-backed infrastructure projects) has raised $24.5 billion for banks and other firms across the region. The EBRD is putting EUR 432m ($590m) into UniCredit, an Italian bank heavily exposed in eastern Europe. It is thinking of investing in 12 other west European banks. Countries such as Sweden have national schemes too. 
In a new report, the IMF argues that European banks still need a lot more help. But the cash and guarantees given already have eased the greatest threat to the region: that western banks might pull out or sink under the weight of their eastern loan books. Meanwhile central Europe, home of many big car factories, has gained from rich-country governments' efforts to help their car industries. Neil Shearing of Capital Economics, a consultancy, reckons that German and other scrapping schemes to boost car sales will add fully 1% to GDP in Slovakia, and 0.5% in the Czech Republic and Hungary. 
The biggest worry now is the Baltic three, which are seeing the sharpest falls in GDP. Estonia's first-quarter figures showed a year-on-year decline of 15.6%. The fall in Latvia was a stunning 18% and in Lithuania 12.6%. Monetary policy cannot counteract this, since all three are pegged to the euro. And fiscal policy offers no respite. Politicians are pushing through spending cuts, not only to reassure external lenders, but also to meet the Maastricht deficit target of 3% of GDP so as to adopt the euro soon (by 2011, Estonia hopes).
""The crisis is even good if it makes the state more efficient,"" says Andrus Ansip, the Estonian prime minister, who is cutting overall public spending by nearly 12%. He has slashed a fifth of the posts in his own chancellery, he says proudly. ""Inefficient"" spending will be cut; budgets vital for future growth will be preserved, he insists.
Devaluation is still largely taboo in the Baltics. The national currencies are not just economic symbols of solidity, but political ones too. Instead, they hope to regain competitiveness through wage cuts and greater efficiency. Such an ""internal devaluation"" is possible in theory, but it is unusual (and painful) in practice. It may work: Latvia now has a current-account surplus as its exports rise. Outsiders are awed by the Balts' determination, though sceptical that the sacrifice will pay off. 
Still, while industries such as construction collapse, others, such as alternative energy, are growing. Mr Ansip cites Estonia's niche in windpower technology. In Latvia a firm called Carbon Neutral Biofuels has raised money for a $10m plant to turn low-grade wood into fuel pellets for Dutch power stations. Adrian Riley, the boss, says the crunch is ""a return to reality after a period of acute silliness"" when high costs threatened his project's viability. 
The Baltics may be a special case: small, relatively well run, with flexible economies and friendly Nordic neighbours. The broader worry across the region is political. Street protests have been muted so far, and some anger against the smug, corrupt and incompetent politicians who squandered the chances of the past decade is anyway healthy. But the European elections in early June may show how voters are reacting to hard times.
Government crises have not brought big changes. The Czech Republic's centre-right coalition lost its majority in March amid a row with the headstrong president, Vaclav Klaus. But the result has not been chaos. Until elections in October, a competent-looking caretaker government will run the country, headed by the chief statistician, Jan Fischer. In Hungary a discredited Socialist prime minister, Ferenc Gyurcsany, resigned, nominating an economist, Gordon Bajnai, to run the government until an election next spring. He is pushing through tough spending cuts, with GDP likely to fall 6% this year. 
Ivan Krastev, a Bulgarian-based analyst of the region's politics, says the fear of unemployment will disillusion middle-class voters and stoke protest voting. A bigger problem may be the fear among political elites, some of whom will stick at nothing to stay in power and out of jail. ""The model is Berlusconi,"" he says glumly.","The region as a whole may have avoided economic meltdown, but several countries still face a painful slump

VIKTOR ORBAN, leader of Hungary's centre-right Fidesz party, should be celebrating. His party has just won 14 of Hungary's 22 seats in the European Parliament. The ruling Socialists, stricken by scandal and economic crisis, took only four. But Mr Orban is worried. For the other big winner was the far-right Jobbik party, with 427,000 votes and three seats. Supported both by far-right voters and by disgruntled ex-socialists, Jobbik is the big new thing in Hungarian politics.
The party did best in the country's rundown, often jobless eastern regions, where it played on growing fears of crime, which it linked to the Roma (Gypsy) minority. Jobbik denies anti-Roma racism; it says it is just against gypsy criminals. But the badges, black trousers and heavy boots of its uniformed wing, the Magyar Garda (Hungarian Guard), which marches in formation against Roma wrongdoers, evoke unhappy memories of Hungary's past.
Jobbik's public face is Krisztina Morvai, a blonde, telegenic law professor, noted for both her forthright feminism and her vituperative attacks on Israel. A message posted under her name on an internet forum demanded that Hungarian Jews should play with their ""tiny circumcised tails"" instead of attacking her. Ms Morvai declines to discuss the matter. Jobbik says it will not comment on private correspondence.
Mr Orban has been moving Fidesz smartly towards the centre in the run-up to next year's election, which polls suggest he will win easily. He wants to lose the reputation he acquired in previous years for irresponsibility in both foreign and economic policy. He has firmly denounced Jobbik's extremism. 
Yet critics say Fidesz is reaping what it sowed. One charge is that its broad-tent approach to the nationalist fringe in the past nurtured Jobbik. Fidesz also sometimes co-operates with the far right in local government. And it shares with Jobbik a fondness for extra-parliamentary protests. These started with riots against the then Socialist government of Ferenc Gyurcsany in 2006. Whenever he rose to speak in parliament, Fidesz members walked out. 
Fault may have lain on both sides, but the language of politics in Hungary has certainly become sharply confrontational. Extremist websites publish the names and contact details of journalists, Roma activists and artists who arouse their ire. They even blame Jews for the decision to pull down a statue of a Turul, a mythical falcon-like bird that had been illegally erected in Budapest.
This week somebody scattered pigs' feet among the riverside memorial, composed of metal shoes, that marks a Nazi atrocity in 1944 when Jews were driven into the waters of the Danube and shot. Outsiders worry about prejudice becoming respectable. The British Embassy, for example, is sponsoring a Music Against Racism event at a Budapest festival in August.

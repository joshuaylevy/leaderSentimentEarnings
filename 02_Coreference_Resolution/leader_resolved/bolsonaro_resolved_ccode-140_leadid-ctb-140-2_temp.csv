ON JULY 1st Mexicans are set to elect Andrés Manuel López Obrador as their next president. Since they twice rejected him, in 2006 and 2012, by coalescing behind the opponent with the best chance of winning, thatrequires some explanation. Mr López Obrador is of the left, but he is a would-be saviour rather than a social democrat. Instead of a better future, he promises to return Mexico to a better, safer past of strong, paternalist government. He invites voters to trust in him, rather than in democratic institutions. As the last two contests showed, in normal circumstances he would not win.
But Mexicans are not looking for politics as usual. Under the outgoing president, Enrique Peña Nieto, they suffer rampant crime and corruption, and mediocre economic growth. Each day 85 people are murdered. Voters ""want blood"", in the form of systematic punishment of corrupt politicians, according to Jorge Castañeda, who is advising Ricardo Anaya, Mr López Obrador's closest rival. Many think that centrist politicians have failed them and that things cannot get any worse.
Brazilians are in a similar mood ahead of their election in October. Most are not yet focused on it, but one of the front-runners in the opinion polls is Jair Bolsonaro, a crudely authoritarian, misogynistic and homophobic former army officer. Brazil, unlike Mexico, has a run-off vote; Mr Bolsonaro may well figure in it but is unlikely to win it. Nevertheless, that he has a chance is a sign of desperate times. Brazil is only slowly emerging from a two-year slump, public services are stretched and public security has broken down in many parts of the country. A recent poll found that 62% of respondents aged 16-24 would leave if they could.
It is not the first time Latin Americans have turned, in an emergency, to would-be saviours. In 1990 voters in Peru found one in Alberto Fujimori, an obscure former university rector. A political outsider, he was elected when his country faced a terrorist insurgency, hyperinflation and economic meltdown. When he sent tanks to shut down the congress two years later, polite society was appalled but ordinary Peruvians cheered. Mr Fujimori won a second term in 1995.
Or take Venezuela. The collapse of the oil price in the 1980s and 1990s weakened a stable social democracy, hollowing out its welfare state, causing bank failures and exposing corruption. In anger, Venezuelans turned to an army lieutenant-colonel, Hugo Chávez, who had led a failed coup that crystallised popular disillusion with the established order. Chávez was elected in 1998. As the oil price surged again, he became a popular hero. But long before his death in 2013 he had propelled his country towards its current feral state of corruption, brutality and penury.
Colombians in 2002 were suffering the tightening grip of the farc guerrillas over much of the national territory as well as a recession and a banking crisis. They normally chose moderate presidents, but they elected Alvaro Uribe, an intense conservative who promised to be ""the first soldier of Colombia"" and to double the size of the security forces.
Mr Fujimori and Mr Uribe saved their countries, but in both cases there was a dark side. Mr Fujimori governed as a dictator and resorted to systematic bribery. Mr Uribe appointed officials with links to right-wing death squads.
When voters choose candidates they normally wouldn't, the negative consequences are long-lasting. In Venezuela, Colombia and Peru these include political polarisation. Peru is trapped in a battle between Mr Fujimori's supporters and anti-fujimorismo. Mr Uribe's candidate, Iván Duque, won Colombia's presidential election on June 17th, but he inherits a country that is ""divided, polarised and facing off against itself in a seemingly irreconcilable fashion"", as Juan Gabriel Vásquez, a Colombian writer, put it in El País, a Spanish newspaper.
The saviours never give up. Mr Fujimori's daughter runs what is still Peru's biggest political party. Not for Mr Uribe, who was re-elected to the senate, the example set by Mariano Rajoy, Spain's former prime minister. After parliament ousted Mr Rajoy this month he returned to his job of 37 years ago as a property registrar in a quiet coastal town.
This lasting polarisation is what may face Mexico and Brazil. It is the high price that countries pay when the political establishment fails in its most basic functions of protecting the lives of citizens or preventing the pilfering of public money. When that happens, it is hardly surprising that voters look elsewhere. But the problem with saviours is that, sooner or later, countries have to try to save themselves from them.","Voters who turn to would - be saviours pay a price for decades afterwards

SÃO PAULO
Contradictory court rulings on freeing the once (and perhaps future) president
WHEN Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva finished his stint as Brazil's president in 2011, his approval rating was 83%. His social programmes and a commodity boom helped lift 30m people out of poverty. He hopes to run for president once again in an election this October, and leads the polls by a healthy margin. Only one obstacle seems to separate him from a third term: he is serving a 12-year prison sentence for corruption. He spends his days listening to samba and watching television in his cell.
Until this month, political observers mostly dismissed Lula's chances of making a comeback. Formally, he has until August 15th to register to stand, which would trigger a review of his eligibility by the electoral tribunal. However, Brazil's ficha limpa (""clean record"") law bars candidates whose convictions have been upheld by an appeals court, as Lula's was in January. His only hope is for the supreme court to overturn the verdict. Some polling firms have already dropped him from their questionnaires, leaving the far-right Jair Bolsonaro as the front-runner. On July 8th, however, a judge decreed that Lula should be freed, plunging the campaign into turmoil.
The saga started when three congressmen from Lula's Workers' Party (pt) filed a habeas-corpus petition demanding his release. Although scores of similar requests had already been filed, the lawmakers timed theirs to fall into the hands of Rogério Favreto, an appeals judge on call over the weekend. Mr Favreto had previously been a member of the pt and worked for Lula's government. He instructed police to let Lula go, saying that another judge had violated Lula's rights by banning him from giving interviews while behind bars.
Mr Favreto's decision was not implemented. In response to his directive, two off-duty judges issued orders negating it. A third, the president of Mr Favreto's tribunal, settled the score, ordering that Lula remain locked up. Nonetheless, the contradictory rulings put Lula back at the centre of the campaign. Google searches for his name spiked 50-fold on July 8th. That increases the risk that Brazilians will regard the election as illegitimate if Lula cannot run. The chaos in the courts also reinforces concerns that the judiciary is becoming just another forum for partisan politics.
Many Brazilians cheered when Lula was first convicted last year. Despite his popularity, the verdict was widely seen as a victory over impunity after decades when the powerful were rarely held to account. Lula is being held in the same police building where Sérgio Moro, one of the magistrates who intervened to keep him in jail, launched the Lava Jato (""Car Wash"") investigation in 2014, unveiling a huge cor- ruption scheme involving politicians and businessmen of all political stripes.
Nonetheless, pt loyalists counter that the judiciary is treating Lula unfairly. He was convicted of accepting a seaside flat worth 2.2m reais ($690,000) from a construction firm and, in return, of encouraging the state oil company to award contracts to that business. Lula swears he is innocent, and that he never owned the flat. In a country where only the supreme court, backlogged with 87,000 cases a year, can hear criminal cases against sitting office-holders-enabling many politicians accused of massive graft to walk free- Lula's 12-year sentence looks harsh. ""We believe the Car Wash operation is political persecution against Lula,"" says Valeska Teixeira Zanin Martins, one of his lawyers.
Lula's supporters also argue that his punishment has exceeded his sentence. In 2016 the supreme court ruled that people convicted of crimes could be jailed after losing an appeal, but did not state whether they retain political rights such as voting and running for office. Another part of the constitution protects these rights, though whether they include giving interviews is up for debate. The judge overseeing Lula's sentence prohibited interviews, citing the terms of Lula's imprisonment and his probable ineligibility for office. Mr Favreto, in contrast, tried to free Lula on the grounds that his incarceration itself violated his political rights as a potential candidate.
Even if Lula is not on the ballot, the pt is counting on these arguments to bolster its support. If enough voters believe Lula has been wronged, they may be more likely to plump for whomever he endorses. In a contest between the authoritarian Mr Bolsonaro and a pt candidate propped up by outrage over anti-corruption efforts, Brazil's fragile democratic institutions would be the only certain loser.","Law and politics in Brazil

At least 8i people were thought to have perished in forest fires near Athens, with many more unaccounted for. The wildfire is believed to be the worst in post-war Europe. Dry conditions have also led to fires in a number of other countries, including Sweden, Norway and Latvia. In Japan a recordbreaking heatwave pushed temperatures above 40°C (104oF) in Tokyo for the first time. At least 65 people have died across Japan because of the heat over the past week; more than 22,600 have been hospitalised.
Spain's People's Party chose a new leader following the resignation of Mariano Rajoy, who was forced to stand down as prime minister last month. The new leader is Pablo Casado, a right-winger.
France was gripped by a presidential scandal involving one of Emmanuel Macron's bodyguards, who was filmed wearing a police helmet (though he is not a policeman) and beating up a protester.
Jeremy Hunt, Britain's new foreign secretary, warned the eu not to expect Britain to ""blink"" in Brexit negotiations, and that there was a ""very real risk of a Brexit no-deal by accident"". This, he said, would lead to ""unintended geopolitical consequences"".
Learning from the past
The Democratic Republic of Congo announced that an outbreak of the Ebola virus had been contained after infecting 54 people and killing 33. No new infections have been reported for 42 days.
More than a dozen senators defected from Nigeria's ruling party, the All Progressives Congress, to join the People's Democratic Party. The defections may weaken the campaign of Muhammadu Buhari for a second term in office in next year's presidential election.
The jihadists ofIslamic State carried out a string of suicidebombings and other attacks in southern Syria that killed 200 people. In recent months the regime of Bashar al-Assad has retaken control of much of southern Syria from rebels and jihadists.
Israel helped hundreds of members of the White Helmets, a civil-defence group, leave southern Syria. The Assad regime, which claims the group supports terrorists, condemned the move. Israel also shot down a Syrian warplane that entered its airspace.
Saudi Arabia's energy minister said he would suspend Saudi oil shipments through the Red Sea following an attack launched by Houthi rebels in Yemen on two Saudi oil carriers. Saudi Arabia is fighting a war against the Houthis, who are backed by Iran.
Look back in anger
Alvaro Uribe, a former president of Colombia and a leading critic of the country's peace deal with the farc guerrillas, stepped down from his seat in the Senate after the Supreme Court said it was expanding its probe of him to include allegations of bribery. Meanwhile, ten former members of the farc took up their seats in Congress. The seats were granted to the former rebel group as part of the agreement that ended five decades of conflict. That deal is under pressure in a new Congress dominated by the right.
Jair Bolsonaro formally entered the Brazilian presidential race. The congressman, a former army officer, is riding high in the polls with his strongman promise to crack down on Brazil's rampant crime and corruption. But he is a controversial candidate; among his many startling remarks, he once said he would not rape a congresswoman because she didn't ""deserve it"".
Daniel Ortega said he would not step down as president of Nicaragua and blamed the opposition and drug gangs for a wave of protests in which 350 people have died since April. Thirteen Latin American countries expressed concern over the violation of ""fundamental freedoms"" in Nicaragua (ie, Mr Ortega's thugs killing protesters).
The imf forecast that Venezuela's inflation rate will hit 1,000,000% by the end of the year. After years of economic mismanagement under President Nicolás Maduro, the economy is set to shrink by 18% in 2018.
Fire and fury, take two
Donald Trump responded to sabre-rattling comments from the Iranian president, Hassan Rouhani, by tweeting that Iran would ""suffer consequences the likes of which few...have ever suffered"" if it kept provoking America. Iran retaliated by saying it would take ""countermeasures"" against American plans to block Iranian oil exports. The barrage of barbs briefly rattled oil markets.
The British government waived a protocol that British citizens extradited to America to stand trial for murder should not face the death penalty, in the case of two members of an Islamic State death squad. Alexanda Kotey and El Shafee Elsheikh are two alleged members of a cell nicknamed The Beatles who carried out a series of highprofile beheadings in Syria. The pair are being held by Kurdish forces in Syria.
Corporate pressure
In China, the chairwoman of a biotech company was among 15 people arrested after hundreds of thousands of vaccines for children were found to be defective. The scandal has elicited outrage. The government said those found responsible would be punished with ""zero tolerance"".
America's biggest airlines sort-of complied with a demand from the Chinese government to alter the way they describe Taiwan. Butinstead of redesignating Taiwan as part of China, as other carriers have done, the American airlines now refer to the airport in Taipei, the Taiwanese capital, in booking and flight information.
The collapse of a dam in Laos's Attapeu province killed at least 20 people. Around 100 are missing. Hydroelectric power has become controversial in Laos as the government has ramped up its investment in dam projects.
Election day in Pakistan was marred by violence; a suicidebomb at a polling station in Quetta killed at least 31 people. Supporters of the party led by Imran Khan, a former cricketer, claimed victory, but his opponents alleged that security officials helped rig the vote.
The Indian government scrapped its tampon tax. Campaigners argued that, by making it costlier to go out without embarrassment while menstruating, the tax was pushing girls to drop out of school.
Business
Tributes were paid to Sergio Marchionne, a lauded chief executive of Fiat Chrysler, after he died from complications following surgery. He was 66. The poker-playing, chainsmoking Mr Marchionne was a larger-than-life figure in the car industry. After turning around a lethargic Fiat he engineered a merger in 2009 with Chrysler, with the backing of the American government, and set about restructuring its management and sales practices. Once asked about Fiat's slow conversion to the electric-car revolution, Mr Marchionne replied: ""Better late than sorry."" Fiat Chrysler's new boss is Mike Manley, the British head of its Jeep division.
Donald Trump met JeanClaude Juncker, the president of the European Commission, in Washington to discuss trade. The two leaders agreed to start a ""dialogue"" on the tit-for-tat tariffs that each side has recently set in motion, but no schedule for talks was forthcoming. They at least backed away from levying new duties.
Reap what ye sow
America's Department of Agriculture announced that it will extend $i2bn in relief to farmers who have been hurt by tariffs imposed by China and other countries in retaliation for Mr Trump's trade war. The imposition of duties has unsettled markets in many agricultural goods. Chinese tariffs on American soyabeans, for example, have curtailed America's exports of the commodity, leading to a build-up of domestic stockpiles and falling prices.
General Motors reported that increased commodity costs were partly to blame for lower profit forecasts. Steel and aluminium have become more expensive because of higher tariffs. Harley-Davidson said that it expects its incremental costs because of tariffs to be up to $55m this year and could be as high as $ioom next year. The motorcycle manufacturer is not just being hit by higher metal costs; it is also moving some production out of America to avoid European duties.
Congress backed down from its threat to reimpose a ban on zte, a Chinese maker of telecoms equipment, acquiring American semiconductors and other components crucial to its business. The White House lifted the ban after reaching a settlement with zte for violating sanctions. Congress wasn't happy with that, but after a round of lobbying by Mr Trump it has softened its position and will instead block companies that work for the government from buying zte's equipment.
Qualcomm, a big American chipmaker, ditched its bid to buy nxp Semiconductors, a Dutch rival, after failing to get approval for the $44bn deal from regulators in China. The withholding of Chinese approval is seen as another shot in the trade war.
Following a series of strikes by pilots in Ireland, its home country, Ryanair warned it might have to cut jobs, cautioning that its reputation for low fares could be affected by the industrial action.
The Turkish lira fell sharply, after the central bank decided to leave its benchmark interest rate on hold, ati7.75%. That unnerved markets hoping for a rate increase to combat inflation, which reached 15.4% in June. It also fuelled worries that Recep Tayyip Erdogan, Turkey's president, who has called interest rates ""the mother of all evil"", is again encroaching on central-bank policymaking.
Alphabet, Google's parent company, reported a 9% drop in quarterly profit compared with the same three months last year, to $3.2bn, as it booked the cost of the eu's recent $5bn fine, levied for abusing the dominance of its Android operating system for smartphones. But Google's advertising revenue, the mainstay of the business, rose by almost a quarter to $28bn, enthusing investors. Alphabet's share price soared to a record high.
By contrast, Facebook's share price swooned after it revealed that its user growth was slowing. It gave a downbeat assessment of its business in the medium term, warning that new video formats and dataprivacy concerns would hit margins.
Britain's Serious Fraud Office sought to reinstate charges against Barclays in relation to a loan it obtained from Qatar's investment company during the financial crisis. A court had dismissed the charges in May.
Papa don't preach
Papa John's adopted a ""poison pill"" to try to stop John Schnatter from gaining control of the pizza chain, following his resignation as chairman for using a racial slur. Mr Schna tter founded the company and controls around 30% of the shares. He has apologised for the slur but now says it was a mistake to step down. In January Mr Schnatter stood aside as chief executive, after he criticised players in the National Football League for kneeling during the national anthem.

 Tributes were paid to Sergio Marchionne , a lauded chief executive of Fiat Chrysler , after he died from complications following surgery . He was 66 . The poker - playing , chainsmoking Mr Marchionne was a larger - than - life figure in the car industry . After turning around a lethargic Fiat he engineered a merger in 2009 with Chrysler , with the backing of the American government , and set about restructuring its management and sales practices . Once asked about Fiat 's slow conversion to the electric - car revolution , Mr Marchionne replied : "" Better late than sorry . "" Fiat Chrysler 's new boss is Mike Manley , the British head of its Jeep division . 
 Donald Trump met JeanClaude Juncker , the president of the European Commission , in Washington to discuss trade . The two leaders agreed to start a "" dialogue "" on the tit - for - tat tariffs that each side has recently set in motion , but no schedule for talks was forthcoming . They at least backed away from levying new duties . 
 Reap what ye sow 
 America 's Department of Agriculture announced that it will extend $ i2bn in relief to farmers who have been hurt by tariffs imposed by China and other countries in retaliation for Mr Trump 's trade war . The imposition of duties has unsettled markets in many agricultural goods . Chinese tariffs on American soyabeans , for example , have curtailed America 's exports of the commodity , leading to a build - up of domestic stockpiles and falling prices . 
 General Motors reported that increased commodity costs were partly to blame for lower profit forecasts . Steel and aluminium have become more expensive because of higher tariffs . Harley - Davidson said that it expects its incremental costs because of tariffs to be up to $ 55 m this year and could be as high as $ ioom next year . The motorcycle manufacturer is not just being hit by higher metal costs ; it is also moving some production out of America to avoid European duties . 
 Congress backed down from its threat to reimpose a ban on zte , a Chinese maker of telecoms equipment , acquiring American semiconductors and other components crucial to its business . The White House lifted the ban after reaching a settlement with zte for violating sanctions . Congress was n't happy with that , but after a round of lobbying by Mr Trump it has softened its position and will instead block companies that work for the government from buying zte 's equipment . 
 Qualcomm , a big American chipmaker , ditched its bid to buy nxp Semiconductors , a Dutch rival , after failing to get approval for the $ 44bn deal from regulators in China . The withholding of Chinese approval is seen as another shot in the trade war .

Jair Bolsonaro, a presidential candidate who is second in the polls, is a threat to democracy
WITH just two months to go before the first round of Brazil's elections, no one has a clue what will happen. The front-runner for the presidency, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, a leftwing former president, is in jail; the courts will almost certainly bar him from running. The rest of the presidential field is fragmented-no candidate polls over 20%. Unless someone wins a majority, the vote will go to a second round on October 28th. At the moment, any of four or five people could win it.
Lula's probable disqualification is just one of many reasons why this election is especially worrying (see Americas section). His supporters are convinced that he has been unfairly singled out, that the corruption charges against him are trumped up and that his 12-year sentence is excessive. His removal from the race will undermine their trust in it. But under a law that Lula himself signed when he was president, convicts may not run for office. The courts should enforce it.
His exit would heighten a second danger-that Jair Bolsonaro (pictured), a flame-throwing right-winger who is second in the polls, will become the front-runner. The former army captain has barged into the front ranks of candidates through a combination of outrageous provocation and mastery of social media. Even if he does not win, the fact that he has come so far shows that the centre ground of politics is crumbling. Rej ecting Mr Bolsonaro outright would be the best way of shoring it up.
Until recently, he was an obscure congressman whose main talent was causing offence. In 2011 he said he would prefer a dead son to a gay one. In 2014 he said of a congresswoman that he wouldn't rape her because she was ""very ugly"". Last year a court fined him for insulting people who live in quilombos, settlements founded by escaped slaves.
Mr Bolsonaro would have remained a fringe figure but for the traumas Brazil has endured over the past four years. The economy suffered its worst-ever recession in 2014-16 and is recovering haltingly. In 2016 a record 62,517 Brazilians were murdered. The Lava Jato (""CarWash"") corruption cases have led to investigations and indictments of leading figures in every big political party and discredited the entire political class.
Mr Bolsonaro proposes brutal solutions to his country's problems. He thinks that ""a policeman who doesn't kill isn't a policeman"" and wants to reduce the age of criminal responsibility to 14. This iron fist belongs to an authoritarian worldview. In 2016 he dedicated his vote to impeach the then-president, Dilma Rousseff, to Carlos Alberto Brilhante Ustra, commander of a police unit responsible for 500 cases of torture and 40 murders during Brazil's dictatorship. The charge against Ms Rousseff, who belongs to Lula's Workers' Party, had nothing directly to do with Lava Jato. But in paying tribute to Ustra, Mr Bolsonaro was asserting that the values of the dictatorship, which governed in 1964-85, are the antidote to today's corruption. Mr Bolsonaro has reinforced that message by naming Hamilton Mouräo, a retired general, as his running-mate. Last year, while still in uniform, Mr Mouräo suggested that, if other institutions failed to solve Brazil's problems, the army could. The left is mainly to blame for the country's ills, in Mr Bolsonaro's cold-war-tinted view.
To Brazilians fed up with politicians, Mr Bolsonaro sounds like an anti-politician. Some businessmen are flirting with him. They like his pistol-packing rhetoric on crime and are intrigued by his recent conversion to economic liberalism (he favours privatising some state enterprises).
Genuflecting to generals
Yet Mr Bolsonaro would make a disastrous president. His rhetoric shows that he does not have sufficient respect for many Brazilians, including gay and black people, to govern fairly. There is little evidence that he understands Brazil's economic problems well enough to solve them. His genuflections to the dictatorship make him a threat to democracy in a country where faith in it has been shaken by the exposure of graft and the misery of the economic slump.
Over 60% of Brazilians say they will never vote for him, more than three times the share of those who say that he has their backing. He lacks support from any strong political party. If he makes it to the second round, odds are that voters will reluctantly choose the alternative, perhaps Geraldo Alckmin, a centrist candidate. He does not deserve to make it even that far.
There is no room for complacency. Other countries with Brazil's mix of crime, elite failure and economic agony have elected radical leaders whom the pundits dismissed as nohopers. It could happen again.","Brazilian politics

SÃO PAULO
The outcome of the upcoming general election is harder to predict than usual
IF BRAZILIAN politics were a telenovela, the general election in October would make for a riveting finale. A motley cast of suitors is vying for the hand of a disappointed electorate. They include an old flame, who is pressing his suit from a jail cell, a swain who has all the attributes brides normally want but is a bit of a bore, and a rascal who promises excitement and danger. Unlike the plots of past political dramas, this one is building up to an ending that is impossible to guess.
That is because this election, in which voters will choose Brazil's president, all members of the lower house of congress and two-thirds of the 81-seat senate, plus governors and legislators in the 26 states and the capital, is different from any that has come before. The voters are more disgusted than at any time since the end of the military dictatorship in 1985. More than a quarter are undecided, an unusually high share just two months before the first round on October 7th; 31% say they might spoil their ballots or leave them blank.
Disillusionment makes voters unpredictable. Will they opt for one of the establishment candidates, who retain the customary advantages of backing by strong parties and the lion's share of advertising time (see chart on next page)? Or will they choose one of the radicals, who must get their message out mainly through social media? Complicating the picture further are a new political-finance regime and new rules for electing members of congress. The fragmented presidential field means that a candidate could enter a runoff, to be held on October 28th if needed, with justi5% of the vote. The safest bet may be that the election will not produce the conditions for political and economic renewal that Brazil needs.
The sour mood comes from two traumas that Brazil has suffered over the past four years. One is the country's worst-ever recession, which began in 2014 and from which the economy is recovering slowly. The other is the Lava Jato (""CarWash"") corruption investigations. These began as a probe into bribe-paying by construction companies to win contracts from Petrobras, the state-controlled oil company, and have implicated scores of politicians from all the main parties. The current president, Michel Temer, has avoided prosecution only because congress voted to protect him from it. Last year just 13% of Brazilians said they were satisfied with their democracy, a lower share than in any other Latin American country, according to Latinobarómetro, a pollster.
The line-up of presidential hopefuls is unlikely to rekindle enthusiasm. The frontrunner is Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, who was president from 2003 to 2010 and remains the country's most popular politician. But he is also the most important scalp claimed by the Lava Jato investigators: he is serving a 12-year sentence for corruption in a jail in Curitiba. That means he will almost certainly be disqualified before the first round. Regardless, on August 4th his Workers' Party (pt) nominated him to be its candidate, hoping to exploit the sympathy of voters who regard him as a left-wing martyr. If he is forced out, his running mate, Fernando Haddad, a former mayor of Sao Paulo, will probably become the pt's presidential candidate.
In polls that do not mention Lula, the leader is Jair Bolsonaro, a far-right congressman who has made a career of insulting gays, women and black people, extolling the dictatorship that ruled Brazil from 1964 to 1985 and advocating violent repression as the best way to fight crime. His running mate is a retired general who said last year that a military coup could solve the country's political crisis.
Lagging behind is Geraldo Alckmin, a centrist former governor of the state of Sao Paulo, who has run for president once before, in 2006. Others in the second tier are Ciro Gomes, a former governor of the state of Ceará who is battling with Lula's pt for the left-wing vote, and Marina Silva, an environmentalist with a compelling life story (she is the daughter of a rubber-tapper). She has run twice before.
Old whines
If the old rules applied, Mr Alckmin would be the strong favourite. That is not because of his charisma. Trained as an anaesthesiologist, he is mocked by Brazilians as a picote de xuxu, an (imaginary) popsicle made from a flavourless vegetable. But Mr Alckmin's Party of Brazilian Social Democracy (psdb) is one of the most powerful (the last elected non-рт president, Fernando Henrique Cardoso, was among its founders). For the first time, it has formed a pre-election coalition with the centrăo (big centre), an agglomeration of smaller parties.
That entitles Mr Alckmin to 44% of free television advertising time, far more than any other candidate. (Ms Silva jokes that she will barely have time to say ""good morning"".) Mr Alckmin will also get the biggest share of 2.6bn reais ($700m) in public campaign financing; for the first time in a presidential election, corporate donations are banned (at least in theory).
In the past, these advantages would have been decisive. The biggest shifts in poll standings normally occur after television advertising begins, which this year will be on August 31st, though the main gainers are usually unknown candidates. Mr Alckmin is, if anything, tiresomely familiar. So are his allies in the centrăo, many of whom have been implicated in Lava Jato cases. ""The pt and the psdb think this will end up being another left-versus-right election,"" says Pablo Ortellado, a professor of public policy at the University of Sāo Paulo. ""But it's about traditional politics versus a rejection of the system.""
The leading rejectionist is Mr Bolsonaro, who plans to win by being a fresh face in national-level politics (though he has been a congressman for 27 years), immoderate in his pronouncements and, unlike Mr Alckmin, compelling to watch. An evangelical Christian, he hopes to appeal to the third of the population that shares his faith and to other conservatives who don't feel represented by the main parties. ""Bolsonaro is an expression of this enormous contingent that's for the first time represented in the political realm,"" says Fernando Schüler, a political scientist at Insper, a university in Sāo Paulo.
To what extent that will translate into votes will depend in part on whether his social-media prowess can counter Mr Alckmin's old-media advantage. Nearly all ""alt-right"" websites support Mr Bolsonaro, says Mr Ortellado, who monitors political social media. That may matter less than Mr Bolsonaro hopes. Just half of Brazilians have frequent access to the internet, points out Mauro Paulino, head of DataFolha, a pollster. Mr Alckmin is trying to attract potential Bolsonaro voters by naming as his running-mate Ana Amelia from the conservative Progressive Party, to which Mr Bolsonaro belonged until 2015.
Another big unknown is how much support Mr Haddad will get if Lula is forced out of the race. The pt has formed an alliance with the Communist Party. Mr Haddad has begun to campaign with Manuela D'Ávila, one of its leaders, in what looks like an effort to familiarise voters with the duo in preparation for Lula's withdrawal. The press has dubbed her the ""vice's vice"".
Although no party is more enmeshed in Lava Jato than the pt, voters remember that the economy prospered and the poor benefited under Lula's presidency. ""The pt stole, but they helped us out,"" says Luciano Trajano, a janitor from Sāo Paulo. Lula's policies helped him buy his first plane ticket to visit his family in the north-eastern state of Paraíba. Such memories could usher Mr Haddad into the second round.
The new rules may change the shape of congress, though probably not as much as reformers hope. Public financing will benefit big parties at the expense of small ones. A ""barrier clause"" enacted last year eliminates money and media time for parties that get less than 1.5% of the vote in at least nine states, a threshold that will eventually rise to 3%. That will put pressure on politicians from small parties to join bigger ones. With fewer, more disciplined parties, congress may be less prone to the grubby deal-making that helped create the Lava Jato scandals.
However, 91% of the lower-house ties under plan to seek reelection, according to O Estado de S. Paulo, a newspaper. Some are surely doing so to keep their immunity from prosecution. ""Congress won't be substantially different,"" said Pérsio Arida, Mr Alckmin's economic adviser, at a recent conference. ""Change must come from the president."" Brazilians can only wait and wonder what sort of change that will be. £","Brazilian politics

Your special report on Spain (July 28th) claimed that sometimes the Catalan independence movement is identitybased and ""borders on racism"". That is untrue. Last year, Europe's biggest demonstration in support of accepting refugees took place in Barcelona, with up to 500,000 marchers. The only far-right movements we have in Catalonia are unionist and almost always nostalgic for Franco. We see the Catalan language as a tool of integration in our multilingual society. We want to normalise the use of our language, which has been persecuted for centuries and still does not have official status throughout Spain. It is not even permitted in the Spanish parliament. In Belgium, 80,000 German-speaking inhabitants have their language fully recognised, whereas 10m Catalanspeakers continue to be treated like second-class citizens.
It is unfair to portray our peaceful movement as having ""an undertone of intimidation and intolerance"", particularly as more than 1,000 Catalan citizens are being prosecuted for organising the referendum on independence. Nine peaceful politicians and civil-society leaders have spent up to ten months (and counting) in prison without trial and seven have been forced into exile. By trying to crush the referendum, the Spanish state has ridden roughshod over fundamental constitutional liberties such as the freedoms of assembly, speech and the press.

Far from making ""things worse"", as you claim, the Spanish Supreme Court's proceedings have, for the first time in 40 years, given the defenders of the constitutional order in Catalonia the recognition they deserve. This has energised opposition to the corrupt entourage of Catalan nationalist cronies, in power since 1978, and resulted in an extremely lively and enthusiastic civil movement that favours continuing links with the rest of Spain.
This is a direct consequence of the dedication, care and hard work that Spain's top magistrates have shown in the face of tremendous political pressure. While our brand new prime minister has gone on holiday, the Supreme Court has decided to remain in post throughout the traditionally idle month of August.

Coal in India
""The black hole of coal"" (August 4th) correctly argues that fossil fuels will persist in India. But India is likely to burn far less coal in the future than anticipated because it is building fewer plants. Credible estimates from just two years ago suggested India would build 243GW of new coal capacity. However, as your article notes, in fact 48GW, or one-fifth the earlier projected capacity, is in the construction pipeline. Government planners think this should be sufficient for India's needs until 2027. Also, private investors are less interested in coal plants.
This does not mean that coal use will cease overnight in India. But a necessary first step is to stop building new plants. India appears to be reaching this point faster than anyone thought likely a few years ago, and consequently will lock into less coal capacity.

In defence of Bolsonaro
Jair Bolsonaro, a presidential candidate in Brazil, is described by you as ""a threat to democracy"" (""Brasilia, we have a problem"", Augustiith). Yet Mr Bolsonaro is aligned with a liberal economist, Paulo Guedes. His supposed radicalism only reflects the wishes of the Brazilian people, who are tired of so much corruption, so much left-wing ideology and so much poverty and underdevelopment. The real threat is to have Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, a convicted criminal, being considered as a candidate.
It is not true that Mr Bolsonaro is racist, homophobic and misogynist. He does want to be the saviour of the Fatherland. He wants to give Brazil a new purpose. In Brazil the leftist press censures and persecutes conservatives. Our journey will be long and difficult; Mr Bolsonaro may be our only chance to start the march out of the mud we are stuck in.

 Your special report on Spain ( July 28th ) claimed that sometimes the Catalan independence movement is identitybased and "" borders on racism "" . That is untrue .

LESS than two years ago, Brazil's municipal elections seemed to give a clear message. The vote came barely a month after Dilma Rousseff, the president, was impeached for fiscal misdemeanours, ending more than 13 years of rule by the left-of-centre Workers' Party (pt). Brazilians gave the pt a hammering: the party won only 254 mayoralties out of more than 5,500, down from 638. The centreright Party of Brazilian Social Democracy (psdb) did well, winning 803. Everything suggested that the psdb, which governed Brazil successfully in 1995-2002, would win this year's presidential election.
With justa month to go before the election, the country's politics have been turned upside down. The psdb's candidate, Geraldo Alckmin, languishes at about 7% in the opinion polls. Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, the pt's leader and Ms Rousseff's mentor, commands around 37% and a widening lead, despite having begun a jail sentence for receiving a beachside flat from a construction firm that benefited from padded government contracts. The electoral tribunal confirmed on August 31st that he cannot run for office, since his conviction was upheld on appeal. Lula's task now is to persuade his supporters to vote for Fernando Haddad, the pt's vicepresidential nominee and a former mayor of Sao Paulo.
Second in the polls, with around 19%, is Jair Bolsonaro, a former army captain of extreme right-wing views. Despite having been a backbench congressman for 27 years, Mr Bolsonaro is a fan of Brazil's military dictatorship of 1964-85; his running mate is a retired general who last year mused that the armed forces might have to step in to settle the country's problems.
Much can change in the next month. But there is a real chance that the inevitable run-off will be between Mr Haddad and Mr Bolsonaro. By rights, neither should have a chance. The pt's policy mistakes led Brazil into a deep and avoidable recession in 2015-16. On its watch, a handful of big companies engaged in wholesale bribery and corruption, exposed in an investigation known as Lava Jato (""Car Wash""). As for Mr Bolsonaro, he defends a repressive regime which bequeathed an economic lost decade in the 1980s and a country in which 40% of 7- to 14-year-olds were not at school.
What explains the electorate's apparent amnesia? The starting point is public anger over the combination of the country's worst-ever recession, a concomitant collapse in public services (dramatised by this week's fire at the National Museum) and the widespread corruption revealed by Lava Jato, which went far beyond the pt.
Ms Rousseff's impeachment brought to power Michel Temer, her vice-president from a coalition partner which broke with the pt in early 2016. A veteran dealmaker of the amorphous political centre, Mr Temer pushed through unpopular but essential economic reforms, including a cap on public spending. But his credibility was destroyed when he was taped apparently discussing bribes with a businessman. He twice used his support in congress to assert his immunity from prosecution.
It is Mr Temer's performance that has facilitated the revival of Lula and the pt. It has allowed them to rail against ""neo-liberalism"", even though austerity is the result of Ms Rousseff's irresponsibility. Many poorer Brazilians recall rising prosperity and government aid under Lula's presidencies. Writing in the New York Times, Lula falsely stated that his jailing ""has nothing to do with corruption"" and is ""for political reasons"", but rightly said that ""millions of Brazilians"" believe this.
The psdb is tarnished too. It joined Mr Temer's government. It failed to expel Aécio Neves, its presidential candidate in 2014, who faces charges of corruption. The middle class-the core of the psdb's base-is in an angry mood. That showed up in the street protests calling for Ms Rousseff's impeachment. The psdb failed to channel the rage or articulate a clearpolitical alternative. Many protesters seem to have turned to Mr Bolsonaro, who campaigns as the pt's nemesis.
An extraordinary campaign may yet hold further twists. Mr Alckmin, though unexciting, has built a broad political alliance that gives him the lion's share of the free television advertising that began this week. A fourth candidate, Marina Silva, an evangelical Protestant (like Mr Bolsonaro) and a former environment minister in Lula's governments, won 21% of the vote in 2014. Having refused to ally with traditional parties, she has few resources, but could yet capture some Lula voters unpersuaded by Mr Haddad. Unless either Mr Alckmin or Ms Silva takes off, Brazilians will have let their justified anger over corruption blind them to other, arguably bigger, failings.","Public anger risks producing political amnesia

In Sweden's general election, the anti-immigrant Sweden Democrats did less well than many had feared, ending up in third place with 17.5% of the vote. But forming a new government could now be difficult, as the centre-right and centre-left alliances are both well short of a majority. Another election may have to be called.
The European Parliament voted to condemn Hungary for abusing democratic norms. This starts a process that could theoretically see Hungary stripped of its voting rights, but actual sanctions are certain to be blocked by Poland and perhaps others.
Theresa May, Britain's prime minister, faced speculation about a leadership challenge. Some 80 Tory mps opposed to her Chequers proposal on Brexit were reported to have met to discuss options that include a no-confidence vote. Jean-Claude Juncker, the president of the European Commission, added to Mrs May's woes. In a speech he said that her proposal was ""the starting point"" for a trade deal, but his overall tone was downbeat and other key parts of the plan were dismissed.
Vladimir Putin said that Britain's allegation that two members of Russia's military intelligence poisoned a former spy in Salisbury earlier this year is wrong. The Russian president claimed that the two men were civilians and would explain ""everything themselves"". They later popped up to say they were just tourists visiting Salisbury's cathedral.
The hospitalised candidate
Doctors said that Jair Bolsonaro, the far-right candidate in Brazil's presidential election, will be kept in care for weeks after he was stabbed in the stomach at a campaign event. Mr Bolsonaro is leading the polls for the first round of next month's election among those who are allowed to run. Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, a former president, has been jailed for corruption and is banned from standing. He ended his legal challenge to that ban this week and pulled out of the race.
A movement of poor and indigenous people blocked sections of the Pan-American highway in Guatemala to protest against the decision by the country's president, Jimmy Morales, to end the mandate of the UN-sponsored International Commission Against Impunity in Guatemala, known as ciciG. Mr Morales has also barred the head of the commission, Iván Velásquez, from returning to Guatemala. ciciG has attracted the president's ire for investigating his family.
China moves into the backyard
America recalled its top diplomats from the Dominican Republic, El Salvador and Panama for consultations. It objected after the countries decided to cut ties with Taiwan and recognise China instead. Only 17 nations still recognise Taiwan. Four of those are in Central America and could also be tempted to end links with Taiwan, raising concern in Washington that China is gaining influence.
Malaysia cancelled three pipeline projects backed by China, the most conspicuous push yet by the new government led by Mahathir Mohamad against the flood of Chinese money swashing around infrastructure projects. In a visit to Beijing recently, Dr Mahathir warned about a new ""colonialism"" and complained of unfair contracts drawn up to service China's Belt and Road Initiative.
A suicide-bombing in eastern Afghanistan killed at least 68 people. The bomber had targeted a group of protesters. Hours earlier a series of bombs hit schools in the city of Jalalabad. One child was killed.
Japan's ruling Liberal Democratic Party began a leadership contest which will culminate in a vote on September 20th. Shigeru Ishiba, a former defence minister, who has criticised Shinzo Abe, the prime minister, for failing to raise living standards, is standing, but Mr Abe is predicted to win.
The king of green
California's governor, Jerry Brown, issued a surprise executive order to make California carbon neutral by 2045, though it is debatable whether that goal can be achieved. In contrast, the federal government proposed easing the requirements on energy companies to carry out repairs and inspections of methane leaks, which could raise emissions of the greenhouse gas.
In his first speech as Donald Trump's national-security adviser, John Bolton threatened to impose sanctions on the International Criminal Court if it brings any action against America or its allies, notably Israel. Based in The Hague, the icc was founded in 2002 and has had a rocky relationship with America ever since.
Around 1.7m people were ordered to evacuate the southeastern coast of the United States as Hurricane Florence bore down on the region. The storm could be the strongest to hit the Carolinas in decades. In South Carolina freeways were converted to one-way routes away from the danger on the coast. On the other side of the world, Hong Kong battened down the hatches ahead of Super Typhoon Mangkhut, forecast to be one of the strongest storms to hit the territory.
A country in chaos
Five days after reopening the only functioning airport in Libya's capital, Tripoli, the authorities closed it again because of rocket fire. Clashes between rival militias continued in the south of the city and Islamic State fighters stormed the state oil company's offices.
Protesters swept through much of Basra, Iraq's second city, torching government buildings, party offices and the Iranian consulate in a weeklong rampage. Government forces shot back but failed to contain rioting sparked by contaminated water in the oil-rich but neglected city.
The Saudi-led coalition resumed its battle for Hodeidah, Yemen's main port, after peace talks collapsed before they began. The delegation representing Houthi rebels failed to show up.
Zimbabwe's president, Emmerson Mnangagwa, shuffled his cabinet, naming technocrats to key posts, signalling his desire to revive a stagnating economy. Among the appointments is Mthuli Ncube, an economist, who was named as finance minister.
Ethiopia and Eritrea reopened their border crossings for the first time since the start of a war in 1998. There has been a rapid improvement in relations with Eritrea after Ethiopia's prime minister, Abiy Ahmed, agreed to withdraw from disputed territory.
Business
Mark Carney, the governor of the Bank of England, agreed to extend his term until January 2020. Philip Hammond, Britain's chancellor of the exchequer, requested the sevenmonth extension to Mr Carney's planned leaving date to ""support a smooth exit"" for Britain from the European Union, saying the summer of 2019 ""could be quite a turbulent period"".
JackMa announced thathe would step down as chairman of Alibaba in September 2019. MrMa founded the Chinese e-commerce company 19 years ago and has been involved in running it ever since. The English-language teacherturned-billionaire wants to focus on his work in education and philanthropy. His successor will be Daniel Zhang, who is currently Alibaba's chief executive.
Sino-Russian co-operation
As he's still in charge, Mr Ma signed a deal through which Alibaba will take a 10% stake in Mail. Ru, a Russian internet giant and the owner of Vkontakte, the country's most popular social network.
Les Moonves resigned with immediate effect as the chief executive and chairman of cbs, following a spate of sexual-harassment allegations dating from the 1980s to the 2000s. The broadcaster has employed lawyers to investigate the claims, which Mr Moonves denies; if they find there is cause to dismiss him, he will forgo some or all of his severance package. Mr Moonves, one of the media industry's most powerful executives, had been embroiled in a battle with the Redstone family, the controlling shareholders in cbs, to dilute its voting power. With his departure, cbs shookup the board, bringing in new directors allied with the Redstones.
The fashion for vaping
Scott Gottlieb, the head of America's Food and Drug Administration, said that the use of e-cigarettes among teenagers had ""reached an epidemic proportion"". Retailers and manufacturers were warned to ""substantially reverse these trends"" or face fines and the possibility of having the products removed from the shelves.
Debenhams reassured investors about its financial performance after its share price swooned in response to reports that it is considering a restructuring. The British chain of department stores has issued three profit warnings this year. Its close rival, House of Fraser, was saved from liquidation last month.
The pace of growth in the average hourly earnings of American workers quickened in August, rising by 2.9% from the same month last year. The unemployment rate held steady at 3.9%. It has been hovering just below or above 4% all year so far; the last time that happened was in 2000. All of which gives the Federal Reserve plenty to dige st when it considers lifting interest rates later this month.
More details were made public about Unilever's plan to scrap its dual British-Dutch stockmarket listing and move its headquarters from Britain to the Netherlands. The consumer-goods group, which makes many well-known household brands and is the world's biggest manufacturer of icecream, has denied that its decision is related to Brexit. That has not stopped it from being criticised in Britain. Unilever will drop out of the ftse ioo index if it relocates, which will force some investment funds to sell their shares in the group.
Driven to distraction
Tesla's investors absorbed news of the departure of both its chief accountant after less than a month in the position and its human-resources director, who is not returning to her job following a leave of absence. There was also more concern about the erratic behaviour of Elon Musk, the electric carmaker's chief executive, when he took a puff of marijuana during a live interview. Tesla's stock has fallen by almost 20% in the past month.
The problems at Tesla weighed on nio, a Chinese maker of electric cars that touts itself as a potential competitor to Mr Musk's firm, when it launched its ipo in New York. With investors looking closely at the prospects for the industry, nio priced the offering of its American depositary shares at $6.26 a share, the bottom of its target price range. They rose 5% on the first day of trading.
The European Parliament voted in favour of a proposal that could force Google, Facebook and other big internet firms to stop users uploading copyrighted content and to share revenue from that content with musicians and writers. Critics say the costs of monitoring such a system, which would make the likes of YouTube liable for copyright infringement, would be huge. The prop osal isa long way from becoming law; the eu's member states still have to be consulted.

""GOD is Brazilian,"" goes a saying that became the title of a popular film. Brazil's beauty, natural wealth and music often make it seem uniquely blessed. But these days Brazilians must wonder whether, like the deity in the film, God has gone on holiday. The economy is a disaster, the public finances are under strain and politics are thoroughly rotten. Street crime is rising, too. Seven Brazilian cities feature in the world's 20 most violent.
The national elections next month give Brazil the chance to start afresh. Yet if, as seems all too possible, victory goes to Jair Bolsonaro, a right-wing populist, they risk making everything worse. Mr Bolsonaro, whose middle name is Messias, or ""Messiah"", promises salvation; in fact, he is a menace to Brazil and to Latin America.
Mr Bolsonaro is the latest in a parade of populists-from Donald Trump in America, to Rodrigo Duterte in the Philippines and a left-right coalition featuring Matteo Salvini in Italy. In Latin America, Andrés Manuel López Obrador, a left-wing firebrand, will take office in Mexico in December. Mr Bolsonaro would be a particularly nasty addition to the club (see Briefing). Were he to win, it might put the very survival of democracy in Latin America's largest country at risk.
Brazilian bitterness
Populists draw on similar grievances. A failing economy is one-and in Brazil the failure has been catastrophic. In the worst recession in its history, gdp per person shrank by 10% in 2014-16 and has yet to recover. The unemployment rate is 12%. The whiff of elite self-dealing and corruption is another grievance-and in Brazil it is a stench. The interlocking investigations known as Lava Jato (Car Wash) have discredited the entire political class. Scores of politicians are under investigation. Michel Temer, who became Brazil's president in 2016 after his predecessor, Dilma Rousseff, was impeached on unrelated charges, has avoided trial by the supreme court only because congress voted to spare him. Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, another former president, was jailed for corruption and disqualified from running in the election. Brazilians tell pollsters that the words which best sum up their country are ""corruption"", ""shame"" and ""disappointment"".
Mr Bolsonaro has exploited their fury brilliantly. Until the Lava Jato scandals, he was an undistinguished seven-term congressman from the state of Rio de Janeiro. He has a long history of being grossly offensive. He said he would not rape a congresswoman because she was ""very ugly""; he said he would prefer a dead son to a gay one; and he suggested that people who live in settlements founded by escaped slaves are fat and lazy. Suddenly that willingness to break taboos is being taken as evidence that he is different from the political hacks in the capital city, Brasilia.
To Brazilians desperate to rid themselves of corrupt politicians and murderous drug dealers, Mr Bolsonaro presents himself as a no-nonsense sheriff. An evangelical Christian, he mixes social conservatism with economic liberalism, to which he has recently converted. His main economic adviser is Paulo Guedes, who was educated at the University of Chicago, a bastion of free-market ideas. He favours the privatisation of all Brazil's state-owned companies and ""brutal"" simplification of taxes. Mr Bolsonaro proposes to slash the number of ministries from 29 to 15, and to put generals in charge of some of them.
His formula is winning support. Polls give him 28% of the vote and he is the clear front-runner in a crowded field for the first round of the elections on October 7th. This month he was stabbed in the stomach at a rally, which put him in hospital. That only made him more popular-and shielded him from closer scrutiny by the media and his opponents. If he faces Fernando Haddad, the nominee of Lula's left-wing Workers' Party (pt) in the second round at the end of the month, many middleand upper-class voters, who blame Lula and the pt above all for Brazil's troubles, could be driven into his arms.
The Pinochet temptation
They should not be fooled. In addition to his illiberal social views, Mr Bolsonaro has a worrying admiration for dictatorship. He dedicated his vote to impeach Ms Rousseff to the commander of a unit responsible for 500 cases of torture and 40 murders under the military regime, which governed Brazil from 1964 to 1985. Mr Bolsonaro's running-mate is Hamilton Mouräo, a retired general, who last year, while in uniform, mused that the army might intervene to solve Brazil's problems. Mr Bolsonaro's answer to crime is, in effect, to kill more criminals-though, in 2016, police killed over 4,000 people.
Latin America has experimented before with mixing authoritarian politics and liberal economics. Augusto Pinochet, a brutal ruler of Chile between 1973 and 1990, was advised by the free-marketeer""Chicago boys"". They helped lay the ground for today's relative prosperity in Chile, but at terrible human and social cost. Brazilians have a fatalism about corruption, summed up in the phrase ""rouba, mas faz"" (""he steals, but he acts""). They should not fall for Mr Bolsonaro-whose dictum might be ""they tortured, but they acted"". Latin America has known all sorts of strongmen, most of them awful. For recent proof, look only to the disasters in Venezuela and Nicaragua.
Mr Bolsonaro might not be able to convert his populism into Pinochet-style dictatorship even if he wanted to. But Brazil's democracy is still young. Even a flirtation with authoritarianism is worrying. All Brazilian presidents need a coalition in congress to pass legislation. Mr Bolsonaro has few political friends. To govern, he could be driven to degrade politics still further, potentially paving the way for someone still worse.
Instead of falling for the vain promises of a dangerous politician in the hope that he can solve all their problems, Brazilians should realise that the task of healing their democracy and reforming their economy will be neither easy nor quick. Some progress has been made-such as a ban on corporate donations to parties and a freeze on federal spending. A lot more reform is needed. Mr Bolsonaro is not the man to provide it.","Jair Bolsonaro would make a disastrous president of Brazil

Next month's presidential election could save Latin America's biggest democracy, or sabotage it
BY 9.00am on September 6th a crowd has appeared outside Fábio Gaia's onestorey house in Murici, a town surrounded by sugar-cane fields. The councilman attends to a stream of constituents who proffer crumpled bits of paper: prescriptions, receipts for ultrasound scans and electricity bills. It is a month before Brazil's general election, so he promises to pay them all. ""We go door to door with our electoral programme, but people ask what we have to give,"" says Mr Gaia, who is campaigning for candidates from the conservative Progressive Party (pp). ""If we don't, the other guys will.""
The other guys are the Calheiros clan, ranchers from Murici who have dominated politics in Alagoas, a poor state in north-eastern Brazil, for more than three decades. Their chief, Renan Calheiros, is a three-time senator who belongs to the country's largest party, the Brazilian Democratic Movement (mdb). His son is the governor, his brother is a state legislator, his nephew is Murici's mayor and his sister-inlaw runs the town's social-assistance centre. In the weeks before the elections, whose first round takes place on October 7th, the centre is distributing sacks of food.
This is how politics works in much of Brazil. The money that flows into party coffers flows out in the form of handouts or vote-buying. The going rate in Alagoas is said to be 100 reais ($25). While vote-buying is rarer in richer places, Alagoas's cashfed web of political alliances has equivalents in other parts of the country.
No dynasty has played the game better than the Calheiroses. In the previous national election, in 2014, the mdb in Alagoas was the party's fourth-biggest fund-raiser, even though, by population, the state ranks 17th. This helped Mr Calheiros to become justice minister and president of the senate under three administrations. To fight the forthcoming election the family has assembled a coalition of 19 parties, the biggest state-level alliance.
Nearly all of Alagoas's 102 mayors back the Calheiros clan. They count on the family to extract money from the federal government for roads, hospitals and other projects, which will help them win re-election when their turn comes (in 2020 for municipal offices). ""Renan has perfect domination on a local level,"" says Geraldo de Majella, a historian of Alagoas.
Despite the largesse, Murici remains poor. Just a tenth of its residents have formal jobs; the mayor's office is the biggest employer. The sugar-cane plantations provide seasonal work. More than half the town's inhabitants get welfare benefits from the federal government.
The pursuit of politics as usual in Murici and places like it is one reason that next month's general election is anything but ordinary. The front-runner in the presidential race is Jair Bolsonaro, a right-wing former army captain who rails against conventional politics, praises dictators and has gun-slinging notions of how to fight crime. After a lunatic knifed him at a rally on September 6th, he is campaigning from a hospital bed. Regardless, he is widely expected to enter a run-off vote, which would be held on October 28th (see chart).
The other dominating personality is LuizInácio Lula da Silva, a left-wing former president who is in jail after being convicted of corruption. He led the presidential race until August 31st, when Brazil's top electoral court disqualified him from running. He remains the country's most popu- lar politician, and its most despised. His replacement as the nominee of the Workers' Party (pt) is Fernando Haddad, a former mayor of the city of Sao Paulo. Polls suggest he has the best chance of meeting Mr Bolsonaro in the run-off.
If that happens, the presidential election will be a contest between Lula's party, which is more responsible than any other for the deepest traumas Brazil has suffered since the end of the dictatorship in 1985, and a candidate who represents an extreme response to them. The first of those traumas is the corruption unearthed by the Lava Jato (""Car Wash"") investigations. It involved politicians and parties taking kickbacks from private-sector companies that won contracts from state-owned firms or extracted other benefits from the state. More than a hundred politicians have been investigated; 12 have been convicted, including Lula. His successor, Dilma Rousseff, was impeached in 2016 on unrelated charges. The current president, Michel Temer, a member of the mdb, has avoided trial in the supreme court only because congress voted to protect him from it. The suspects in Alagoas include Mr Calheiros, who faces several inquiries, and Benedito de Lira, a pp senator backed by Mr Gaia who is running for re-election.
The second trauma is Brazil's worstever recession, which started as Lava Jato was getting under way in 2014 (see chart). It slashed gdp per person by 10% and dragged back into poverty millions of Brazilians who had entered the middle class. Although growth has resumed, it is a feeble 1.4% a year. A further cause of dismay is crime. The number of murders rose 3% last year, to a record of nearly 64,000.
These crises have shaken Brazilians' faith in democracy. Just 13% were satisfied with their democracy last year, the lowest share in Latin America, according to Latinobarómetro, a pollster. Rebelliousness has been evident since 2013, when demonstrations in Sao Paulo over a rise in bus fares spread to other cities and over other issues, including the poor quality of public services. A ten-day strike by lorry drivers in May this year over a rise in fuel prices paralysed the economy and forced the government to restore subsidies temporarily.
At stake in the elections is whether Brazil's next cohort of leaders can provide good enough governance to contain such conflicts and restore trust in the country's institutions. That depends in turn on making progress on three big tasks. The first is to rid politics as much as possible of the graft thathas brought democracy into disrepute. The second is to avert a slow-moving economic crisis that threatens to condemn Brazil to slow growth, high inflation and impotent government. The third is to reduce violence.
Any government that tries to stabilise Brazil will provoke conflict with groups that lose from reforms. Expect another round with lorry drivers over fuel subsidies, which are scheduled to expire in December. A president serious about cleaning up politics will clash with congressmen whose support he or she will need to pass economic reform. Fighting crime will require better co-ordination between the federal government and the states, and between separate police forces within states. If Mr Bolsonaro becomes president, the next government might accomplish none of the above. Worse, his authoritarian instincts might weaken Brazilian democracy still further.
In theory, the elections offer the possibility of renewal. Brazilians will choose the president, all 513 members of the lower house of congress, two-thirds of the 81member senate and governors and legislatures in all 27 states. But the way politicking is done in Alagoas shows why renewal will be hard. Voters face a bewildering array of parties, most of which stand for nothing, and candidates, most of whom are non-entities. Nationwide, the number of parties has expanded from seven in 1988 when the constitution was adopted to 35 now; 28 are represented in congress. Most exist only because they are entitled to public money and time on 25-minute-long programmes of advertising, which are broadcast twice a day during campaigns. Aggregator parties like the mdb assemble smaller ones into pre-election coalitions, acquiring their broadcast time in exchange for future government jobs.
Tears of a clown
The plethora of candidates comes from Brazil's unusual system of ""open-list proportional representation"" for electing deputies to the lower house of congress and state legislatures. If a candidate amasses more votes than he needs to get elected, the excess is distributed to others in his coalition. Brazilians call this the ""Tiririca effect"", after a clown whose spare votes in 2010 brought in three other deputies. Lower-house deputies represent their entire states. This means they have to spend lots of money to get elected and have little connection to their constituents.
In Alagoas, 441 candidates are running for 40 legislative and executive jobs. To anyone concerned about political consistency, their alliances make no sense. On September 6th a drum-banging, flag-waving throng held a march on the outskirts of Maceió, Alagoas's capital, for Mr Calheiros and his son, Renan Calheiros Filho, the governor. Among the marchers were politicians from the Communist Party as well as the conservative Party of the Republic. A week earlier, the Calheiroses held a rally with Mr Haddad, even though the mdb has its own presidential candidate, Henrique Meirelles, a former finance minister. That is because Lula, Mr Haddad's mentor, is remembered as a president who brought prosperity to many poor Brazilians, especially in the north-east. ""It's a calculus for political survival,"" says an adviser to the Calheiros campaign.
Rather than a mandate for governing, elections held under these conditions produce the opening positions of a game played between the president and a fragmented congress, which Brazilians call presidencialismo de coaliçao (""coalition presidentialism""). This entails the president assembling a coalition of parties, which has little to do with ideology and may not be the same as the pre-election coalitions, to enact his or her governing programme. The glue is government jobs for supporters, money for crowd-pleasing projects and, especially in recent years, graft on an epic scale.
Brazilians have reached the end of their patience with this system. In a poll conducted late last year, 62% of respondents identified corruption as Brazil's biggest problem. It is the biggest reason for the rise of Mr Bolsonaro, who portrays himself as a scourge of the establishment, even though he has been a congressman for 28 years and belonged to nine different parties.
Despite the despair, the system has shown that it has some capacity to reform itself. Lava Jato shows that prosecutors and judges are eager to exercise the independence guaranteed to them under the constitution by going after the most powerful people in the country. Politicians and the courts have made modest changes to the electoral system. The supreme court has banned corporate donations to parties, which has cut the cost of this year's election by 70-80%, estimates Chris Garman of Eurasia Group, a consultancy. Congress has enacted a ""performance clause"", which eliminates public funding and media time for parties that get less than 1.5% of the national vote distributed across at least nine states (the threshold will eventually rise to 3%). This may reduce the number of parties in congress.
But the changes these reforms will bring about will be gradual, if they happen at all. One reason is that Lava Jato has sharpened the incentive for politicians to cling to office. That is because sitting politicians can be tried only by the supreme court. At least 30 people suspected of wrongdoing are running for re-election, according to Folha de S.Paulo, a newspaper. Mr Garman estimates that 70% of the new lower house will consist ofholdovers from the current one, up from a re-election rate in the current congress of 55%. The ban on corporate donations has made it harder for newcomers to challenge incumbents.
The next congress and president will be caught between the pressure for further reform and a desire for self-preservation. The bolder ideas range from carving up states into electoral districts to scrapping Brazil's presidential system in favour of a parliamentary one, but it is hard to see legislators changing so drastically the system that elected them. More feasible are proposals to improve regulation of lobbying and procurement by government agencies and state firms. Voters will demand that Lava Jato continue unimpeded; politicians may try to put grit in the judicial machinery. ""The political system will try to limit the power oflegal institutions whatever the results of the election,"" predicts Oscar Vilhena, dean of the law school at Fundaçao Getulio Vargas, a university. If the next government continues to buy support with pork and patronage, but limits outright bribery, that would be a big improvement.
Bringing economic relief may be easier than attempting political renewal. That is what Mr Temer tried to do after he took over from Ms Rousseff in 2016, with some success. Congress enacted a constitutional amendment that freezes federal spending in real terms at least until 2026. Another reform made the labour market more flexible. Mr Temer came close to a reform of the pension system in May last year, when a newspaper made public an audio tape on which he appeared to endorse the payment of hush money to a politician convicted of taking bribes. Mr Temer spent his political capital to avoid prosecution.
The aborted reform leaves Brazil's economy in a parlous state. The budget deficit is equivalent to 7% of gdp. Spending on pensions for retired public employees and formal-sector workers accounts for 56% of federal spending and is growing at a rate four percentage points above inflation. Tax giveaways, expanded by Ms Rousseff's government, are more than 4% of gdp. This, plus the slow growth of the economy, is raising debt to unsustainable levels. Gross public-sector debt rose from 78% of gdp in 2016 to 84% last year.
The danger is not that Brazil will go the way of next-door Argentina, which has had to seek help from the imf (see Americas section). Unlike Argentina, Brazil owes money mainly in its own currency and to its own citizens, so declines in the value of the real do not greatly increase its net indebtedness. The country has $38obn of reserves, equivalent to a fifth of gdp.
The cupboard is bare
But that does not mean that Brazil is in the clear. Doubts about its financial stability will weigh on the real, which in turn will raise inflation. Real incomes, investment and growth will suffer. With non-discretionary spending such as pension benefits consuming more than 90% of the federal budget, little is left over for such services as health. Many state governments, which are responsible for policing and education among other things, are in even worse fiscal shape. Economists reckon that Brazil needs spending cuts or revenue rises of 300bn reais a year, equivalent to 4% of gdp, to stabilise federal debt.
Most presidential candidates now accept that pensions need to change. That is partly because voters have come to resent a system that lets bureaucrats retire in their 50s, often with full salary. Opposition to the sort of reform that Mr Temer proposed dropped from 68% to 44%, according to polls commissioned by the government. There is also agreement on the need to raise tax revenue, although the details vary among candidates.
Despite this glimmer of consensus, markets are pessimistic. The real has fallen to a record low against the dollar. In part that is because the candidates likeliest to win the presidency are least equipped to govern. Both the front-runners represent polarising forces. They will have a hard time getting support for reforms. Candidates with the best economic ideas are unlikely to make it into the second round.
Mr Bolsonaro's main talent is for whipping up public anger. He trumpets a newfound interest in liberal economics. His chief economic adviser is Paulo Guedes, who was educated at the University of Chicago, a nursery of market-minded economists. Mr Bolsonaro belongs to the tiny Social Liberal Party and has few allies. ""Our party is the people,"" he declares. Unless he makes peace with the political class, he is unlikely to get his reforms through congress.
Mr Haddad, his likeliest opponent in the second round, has a bigger party behind him and was a successful mayor. He promises to put debt ""on a downward path"". But his party is less reform-minded than he is. He will struggle to shake the perception that he is Lula's puppet.
The other main candidates are less polarising, and less likely to push voters into the arms of Mr Bolsonaro in the run-off. All have drawbacks. Ciro Gomes, a left-wing former governor of the north-eastern state of Ceará, favours interventionist policies of the sort that aggravated Brazil's economic crisis, such as subsidised lending.
Two centrists are mirror images of each other. Geraldo Alckmin, a former governor of the state of Sao Paulo, is competent and backed by an enormous coalition, which bodes well for his ability to enact economic reforms. But he is colourless and belongs to the Party of Brazilian Social Democracy (psdb), which is among the most tarnished by Lava Jato. More inspiring is Marina Silva, a former environment minister who was born into an illiterate rubbertapping family in the Amazon and learned to read when she was 16. Ms Silva shares Mr Bolsonaro's unwillingness to engage in pork-barrel politics, which will make governing hard. She is more likely than the populistto stick to her resolve.
The voters of Alagoas seem torn between the handouts and compromises that come with old-style politics and the hope of something better. Rodrigo Cunha, a candidate for senator from the psdb, is promising reform. Running on an anti-corruption platform, he is putting up a strong challenge for one of the two senate seats up for grabs. But Alagoans also have a pragmatic streak. Jurandi Pimentel, an unemployed taxi driver, says he will vote for Mr Cunha, but his other senatorial vote will go to Mr Calheiros. ""Alagoas would die without someone who knows how to do politics like the rest of them,"" he says.","MURICI 
 Next month 's presidential election could save Latin America 's biggest democracy , or sabotage it 
 BY 9.00am on September 6th a crowd has appeared outside Fábio Gaia 's onestorey house in Murici , a town surrounded by sugar - cane fields . The councilman attends to a stream of constituents who proffer crumpled bits of paper : prescriptions , receipts for ultrasound scans and electricity bills . It is a month before Brazil 's general election , so he promises to pay them all . "" We go door to door with our electoral programme , but people ask what we have to give , "" says Mr Gaia , who is campaigning for candidates from the conservative Progressive Party ( pp ) . "" If we do n't , the other guys will . "" 
 The other guys are the Calheiros clan , ranchers from Murici who have dominated politics in Alagoas , a poor state in north - eastern Brazil , for more than three decades . Their chief , Renan Calheiros , is a three - time senator who belongs to the country 's largest party , the Brazilian Democratic Movement ( mdb ) . His son is the governor , his brother is a state legislator , his nephew is Murici 's mayor and his sister - inlaw runs the town 's social - assistance centre . In the weeks before the elections , whose first round takes place on October 7th , the centre is distributing sacks of food . 
 This is how politics works in much of Brazil . The money that flows into party coffers flows out in the form of handouts or vote - buying . The going rate in Alagoas is said to be 100 reais ( $ 25 ) . While vote - buying is rarer in richer places , Alagoas 's cashfed web of political alliances has equivalents in other parts of the country . 
 No dynasty has played the game better than the Calheiroses . In the previous national election , in 2014 , the mdb in Alagoas was the party 's fourth - biggest fund - raiser , even though , by population , the state ranks 17th . This helped Mr Calheiros to become justice minister and president of the senate under three administrations . To fight the forthcoming election the family has assembled a coalition of 19 parties , the biggest state - level alliance . 
 Nearly all of Alagoas 's 102 mayors back the Calheiros clan . They count on the family to extract money from the federal government for roads , hospitals and other projects , which will help them win re - election when their turn comes ( in 2020 for municipal offices ) . "" Renan has perfect domination on a local level , "" says Geraldo de Majella , a historian of Alagoas . 
 Despite the largesse , Murici remains poor . Just a tenth of its residents have formal jobs ; the mayor 's office is the biggest employer . The sugar - cane plantations provide seasonal work . More than half the town 's inhabitants get welfare benefits from the federal government . 
 The pursuit of politics as usual in Murici and places like it is one reason that next month 's general election is anything but ordinary . The front - runner in the presidential race is Jair Bolsonaro . After a lunatic knifed Jair Bolsonaro at a rally on September 6th , Jair Bolsonaro is campaigning from a hospital bed . Regardless , Jair Bolsonaro is widely expected to enter a run - off vote , which would be held on October 28th ( see chart ) . 
 The other dominating personality is LuizInácio Lula da Silva , a left - wing former president who is in jail after being convicted of corruption . He led the presidential race until August 31st , when Brazil 's top electoral court disqualified him from running . He remains the country 's most popu- lar politician , and its most despised . His replacement as the nominee of the Workers ' Party ( pt ) is Fernando Haddad , a former mayor of the city of Sao Paulo . Polls suggest he has the best chance of meeting Jair Bolsonaro in the run - off . 
 If that happens , the presidential election will be a contest between Lula 's party , which is more responsible than any other for the deepest traumas Brazil has suffered since the end of the dictatorship in 1985 , and a candidate who represents an extreme response to them . The first of those traumas is the corruption unearthed by the Lava Jato ( "" Car Wash "" ) investigations . It involved politicians and parties taking kickbacks from private - sector companies that won contracts from state - owned firms or extracted other benefits from the state . More than a hundred politicians have been investigated ; 12 have been convicted , including Lula . His successor , Dilma Rousseff , was impeached in 2016 on unrelated charges . The current president , Michel Temer , a member of the mdb , has avoided trial in the supreme court only because congress voted to protect him from it . The suspects in Alagoas include Mr Calheiros , who faces several inquiries , and Benedito de Lira , a pp senator backed by Mr Gaia who is running for re - election . 
 The second trauma is Brazil 's worstever recession , which started as Lava Jato was getting under way in 2014 ( see chart ) . It slashed gdp per person by 10 % and dragged back into poverty millions of Brazilians who had entered the middle class . Although growth has resumed , it is a feeble 1.4 % a year . A further cause of dismay is crime . The number of murders rose 3 % last year , to a record of nearly 64,000 . 
 These crises have shaken Brazilians ' faith in democracy . Just 13 % were satisfied with their democracy last year , the lowest share in Latin America , according to Latinobarómetro , a pollster . Rebelliousness has been evident since 2013 , when demonstrations in Sao Paulo over a rise in bus fares spread to other cities and over other issues , including the poor quality of public services . A ten - day strike by lorry drivers in May this year over a rise in fuel prices paralysed the economy and forced the government to restore subsidies temporarily . 
 At stake in the elections is whether Brazil 's next cohort of leaders can provide good enough governance to contain such conflicts and restore trust in the country 's institutions . That depends in turn on making progress on three big tasks . The first is to rid politics as much as possible of the graft thathas brought democracy into disrepute . The second is to avert a slow - moving economic crisis that threatens to condemn Brazil to slow growth , high inflation and impotent government . The third is to reduce violence . 
 Any government that tries to stabilise Brazil will provoke conflict with groups that lose from reforms . Expect another round with lorry drivers over fuel subsidies , which are scheduled to expire in December . A president serious about cleaning up politics will clash with congressmen whose support he or she will need to pass economic reform . Fighting crime will require better co - ordination between the federal government and the states , and between separate police forces within states . If Jair Bolsonaro becomes president , the next government might accomplish none of the above . Worse , Jair Bolsonaro's authoritarian instincts might weaken Brazilian democracy still further . 
 In theory , the elections offer the possibility of renewal . Brazilians will choose the president , all 513 members of the lower house of congress , two - thirds of the 81member senate and governors and legislatures in all 27 states . But the way politicking is done in Alagoas shows why renewal will be hard . Voters face a bewildering array of parties , most of which stand for nothing , and candidates , most of whom are non - entities . Nationwide , the number of parties has expanded from seven in 1988 when the constitution was adopted to 35 now ; 28 are represented in congress . Most exist only because they are entitled to public money and time on 25 - minute - long programmes of advertising , which are broadcast twice a day during campaigns . Aggregator parties like the mdb assemble smaller ones into pre - election coalitions , acquiring their broadcast time in exchange for future government jobs . 
 Tears of a clown 
 The plethora of candidates comes from Brazil 's unusual system of "" open - list proportional representation "" for electing deputies to the lower house of congress and state legislatures . If a candidate amasses more votes than he needs to get elected , the excess is distributed to others in his coalition . Brazilians call this the "" Tiririca effect "" , after a clown whose spare votes in 2010 brought in three other deputies . Lower - house deputies represent their entire states . This means they have to spend lots of money to get elected and have little connection to their constituents . 
 In Alagoas , 441 candidates are running for 40 legislative and executive jobs . To anyone concerned about political consistency , their alliances make no sense . On September 6th a drum - banging , flag - waving throng held a march on the outskirts of Maceió , Alagoas 's capital , for Mr Calheiros and his son , Renan Calheiros Filho , the governor . Among the marchers were politicians from the Communist Party as well as the conservative Party of the Republic . A week earlier , the Calheiroses held a rally with Mr Haddad , even though the mdb has its own presidential candidate , Henrique Meirelles , a former finance minister . That is because Lula , Mr Haddad 's mentor , is remembered as a president who brought prosperity to many poor Brazilians , especially in the north - east . "" It 's a calculus for political survival , "" says an adviser to the Calheiros campaign . 
 Rather than a mandate for governing , elections held under these conditions produce the opening positions of a game played between the president and a fragmented congress , which Brazilians call presidencialismo de coaliçao ( "" coalition presidentialism "" ) . This entails the president assembling a coalition of parties , which has little to do with ideology and may not be the same as the pre - election coalitions , to enact his or her governing programme . The glue is government jobs for supporters , money for crowd - pleasing projects and , especially in recent years , graft on an epic scale . 
 Brazilians have reached the end of their patience with this system . In a poll conducted late last year , 62 % of respondents identified corruption as Brazil 's biggest problem . It is the biggest reason for the rise of Jair Bolsonaro different parties . 
 Despite the despair , the system has shown that it has some capacity to reform itself . Lava Jato shows that prosecutors and judges are eager to exercise the independence guaranteed to them under the constitution by going after the most powerful people in the country . Politicians and the courts have made modest changes to the electoral system . The supreme court has banned corporate donations to parties , which has cut the cost of this year 's election by 70 - 80 % , estimates Chris Garman of Eurasia Group , a consultancy . Congress has enacted a "" performance clause "" , which eliminates public funding and media time for parties that get less than 1.5 % of the national vote distributed across at least nine states ( the threshold will eventually rise to 3 % ) . This may reduce the number of parties in congress . 
 But the changes these reforms will bring about will be gradual , if they happen at all . One reason is that Lava Jato has sharpened the incentive for politicians to cling to office . That is because sitting politicians can be tried only by the supreme court . At least 30 people suspected of wrongdoing are running for re - election , according to Folha de S.Paulo , a newspaper . Mr Garman estimates that 70 % of the new lower house will consist ofholdovers from the current one , up from a re - election rate in the current congress of 55 % . The ban on corporate donations has made it harder for newcomers to challenge incumbents . 
 The next congress and president will be caught between the pressure for further reform and a desire for self - preservation . The bolder ideas range from carving up states into electoral districts to scrapping Brazil 's presidential system in favour of a parliamentary one , but it is hard to see legislators changing so drastically the system that elected them . More feasible are proposals to improve regulation of lobbying and procurement by government agencies and state firms . Voters will demand that Lava Jato continue unimpeded ; politicians may try to put grit in the judicial machinery . "" The political system will try to limit the power oflegal institutions whatever the results of the election , "" predicts Oscar Vilhena , dean of the law school at Fundaçao Getulio Vargas , a university . If the next government continues to buy support with pork and patronage , but limits outright bribery , that would be a big improvement . 
 Bringing economic relief may be easier than attempting political renewal . That is what Mr Temer tried to do after he took over from Ms Rousseff in 2016 , with some success . Congress enacted a constitutional amendment that freezes federal spending in real terms at least until 2026 . Another reform made the labour market more flexible . Mr Temer came close to a reform of the pension system in May last year , when a newspaper made public an audio tape on which he appeared to endorse the payment of hush money to a politician convicted of taking bribes . Mr Temer spent his political capital to avoid prosecution . 
 The aborted reform leaves Brazil 's economy in a parlous state . The budget deficit is equivalent to 7 % of gdp . Spending on pensions for retired public employees and formal - sector workers accounts for 56 % of federal spending and is growing at a rate four percentage points above inflation . Tax giveaways , expanded by Ms Rousseff 's government , are more than 4 % of gdp . This , plus the slow growth of the economy , is raising debt to unsustainable levels . Gross public - sector debt rose from 78 % of gdp in 2016 to 84 % last year . 
 The danger is not that Brazil will go the way of next - door Argentina , which has had to seek help from the imf ( see Americas section ) . Unlike Argentina , Brazil owes money mainly in its own currency and to its own citizens , so declines in the value of the real do not greatly increase its net indebtedness . The country has $ 38obn of reserves , equivalent to a fifth of gdp . 
 The cupboard is bare 
 But that does not mean that Brazil is in the clear . Doubts about its financial stability will weigh on the real , which in turn will raise inflation . Real incomes , investment and growth will suffer . With non - discretionary spending such as pension benefits consuming more than 90 % of the federal budget , little is left over for such services as health .

You made a good case for all that is wrong about Jair Bolsonaro, though you should also have compared him with the alternative that Brazilians face in the forthcoming elections (""Latin America's latest menace"", September 22nd). This election is about choosing the least-worst presidential candidate. If the polls are to be believed, the second-round run-off will be between Mr Bolsonaro and Fernando Haddad, who represents the Workers' Party. Mr Haddad's campaign is being masterminded by Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, the party's leader, from his prison cell.
For all his faults, and he has many, there is a chance that Mr Bolsonaro will provide Brazil with the right leadership and make badly needed reforms to the pension and tax systems, privatise poorly run state companies and reduce the overall size of government. Based on the record of the Workers' Party there is no chance that it will undertake these vital measures and every chance that it will lead Brazil down the path of Venezuela. That would be a far bigger threat to democracy in Brazil and Latin America.
Under this scenario Mr Bolsonaro becomes a risk worth taking for many Brazilians. They have become completely disillusioned with the political classes of this beautiful and bountiful but badly mismanaged country.

The court's decisions
You suggested that America's Supreme Court became politicised through exposure to the quarrels in American society, as if a communicable disease had been transmitted (""And Brett makes five"", September 15th). A better analogy is the phenomenon of agency capture. Powerful Republican interests have for years sought judicial nominees who will follow an agenda they constantly present through ""friend of the court"" filings. When decisions break five-to-four on partisan lines (all Republican appointees voting together as a bloc) on matters important to those interests, their win rate is 100% across more than 70 decisions under Chief Justice John Roberts. This is no statistical fluke. That is capture. Hence the otherwise inexplicable behaviour of Republicans in the Kavanaugh nomination, desperate to keep that five-to-four advantage for their big donors.

Treating gender dysphoria
Regarding transgender behaviour during adolescence (""Trans parenting"", September 1st), sometimes teenagers with general identity weakness develop transient symptoms of gender dysphoria. These adolescents sometimes even consider themselves ""transgendered"" in an effort to improve peer relationships and buttress their sense of identity. If the symptoms are significant they can generally be resolved through psychotherapy.
Patients like these represent a subgroup of adolescents who are different from (although superficially similar to) those who are truly transgendered. The therapeutic stance we advocate is to respect the patient's total ""personhood"" and understand how identity develops in the context of familial and peer relationships and the sense of the self. In practice, doctors should not reinforce specific gender-role behaviours, nor determine whether it is desirable for the adolescent to ""be"" female or male, or neither.

More thanjust a mentor
The Philosophy brief on Schumpeter, Popper and Hayek referred to Ludwig von Mises as Hayek's mentor (August 25th). The contributions of von Mises to liberal philosophy were far reaching and more influential than you think. In 1922 he published ""Socialism: An Economic and Sociological Analysis"", in which he demonstrated the impossibility of socialism as an economic and social system and described how it leads to the destruction of the social fabric.
His book, ""Omnipotent Government"", published in 1944, the same year as Hayek's ""The Road to Serfdom"", is a thorough analysis of the collapse of liberal ideas in Germany and the rise of nationalism, which led to Nazism. Von Mises's works on economics include the first coherent application of the theory of marginal utility (which was developed by Carl Menger) to money (""The Theory of Money and Credit"") and a study of the epistemology of economics (""Epistemological Problems of Economics"").

What constitutes goodwill?
I enjoyed Schumpeter's column on goodwill, an important topic that requires better accounting on firms' balancesheets (September1st). However, goodwill does not represent the difference between the price the acquirer ""paid to buy another firm and the target's original book value"". Before the amount of goodwill arising from an acquisition is determined, the acquirer's accountants allocate as much of the purchase price to what they can justify as the fair value of the target's tangible and other intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed. Only the remaining, unallocated excess purchase price is recorded as goodwill.
It is worth noting that because of the above requirement and the fact that goodwill is not something that can be bought or sold separately, a minority view held by some accountants is that goodwill is not an asset. In the 1950s and 1960s, when accounting was a more principles-based profession, Arthur Andersen proposed showing the non-allocated excess purchase price as a subtraction from the acquirer's shareholders' equity. This might trouble those who are fixated on financial ratios, but it also would provide a clearer indication of how much the acquirer has paid for undocumented expectations.

Latin lessons
I was tickled by Johnson's column on the use of Latin words in English (September 8th). My wife was recently in physical therapy and had difficulty grasping the difference between adductor and abductor muscles. I explained that in Latin ad means ""toward"" and ab means ""away from""; thus, an adductor muscle is one that pulls a limb toward the central line of the body, an abductor muscle one that pulls a limb away from that line. We explored other examples of ad and ab words but ran into a bit of trouble with adverse and averse (where ab has been replaced by ""a"" for ease of pronunciation) because their functional meanings (""inimical to"" and ""feeling repugnance toward"") are much more alike than their etymological meanings (""turning toward/against"" and ""turning away from""). To my mind such subtleties are one of the infinite charms of language.

JairBolsonaro, a right-wing former army captain, led the race for Brazil's presidency after a first round of voting. He got 46% of the vote. In the run-off he will face Fernando Haddad, the nominee of the left-wing Workers' Party, who got 29%. In the congressional election Mr Bolsonaro's Social Liberal Party jumped from eight lower-house seats in the outgoing congress to 52 in the new one, becoming the second-largest party.
A judge in California blocked plans by the Trump administration to deport some migrants from El Salvador, Haiti, Nicaragua and Sudan who had enjoyed ""temporary protected status"" in America. The administration said it had ended tps for citizens of the four countries because the emergencies that had justified giving them refuge in America had ended.
In Venezuela, Fernando Albán, a councilman whom the regime accused of participating in an attempt to assassinate President Nicolás Maduro by drones, died in the custody of the country's intelligence service. The government said he killed himself by jumping from the tenth floor of the agency's headquarters. Opposition politicians accused the government of murder.
Keiko Fujimori, who leads Popular Force, the largest party in Peru's congress, was detained by prosecutors investigating undeclared campaign donations.

China can't help
The government of Pakistan turned to the imf for a loan to help ease a balance-of-payments crisis. Imran Khan, the prime minister of two months, had previously suggested that his government would be able to borrow from ""friendly countries"" instead.

China confirmed that it had arrested the Chinese president of Interpol, Meng Hongwei. Mr Meng disappeared in late September after returning to Beijing for a visit. China eventually said that he was being investigated for bribery. Interpol was informed that he had resigned as its head.
Tentacles of a scandal
South Africa's finance minister, Nhlanhla Nene, resigned after testifying that he had met the Gupta family, which is at the centre of allegations of cronyism and ""state capture"", more often than he had previously disclosed. There was no indication that Mr Nene had done anything illegal orimmoral. He was replaced by a former governor of the central bank, Tito Mboweni.
A presidential election took place peacefully in most parts of Cameroon, although violence was reported in Englishspeaking regions. Counting is expected to take two weeks.
Turkish officials said they think Jamal Khashoggi, a prominent Saudi journalist and government critic, was murdered and dismembered inside the Saudi consulate in Istanbul by a team of Saudi agents on orders from the royal court.
An increasingly dangerous job
Viktoria Marinova, a journalist, was raped and murdered in Bulgaria. Last month, she hosted a television show reporting on a big fraud case involving the misuse of eu subsidies. This is the third recent murder in Europe of a journalistwho had been investigating corruption.
Two astronauts, a Russian and an American, en route to the International Space Station, survived the malfunction of their Soyuz launch rocket. Their capsule separated from the booster and landed safely in Kazakhstan.
Britain's Supreme Court ruled in favour of a Christianowned bakery in Northern Ireland that refused to make a cake with a slogan supporting gay marriage, which remains illegal in the province. The judges found that the bakers had not refused to serve the customer who ordered the cake on the basis of his sexuality, and were justified on free-speech grounds in not baking the message he wanted displayed on it.
The UN-backed Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change urged governments to take action to keep the Earth's temperature to within i.5°C (2.7 oF) of pre-industrial levels, a tougher goal than keeping the temperature ""well below"" 2°C that was agreed to in the Paris climate accord of 2015.
Hurricane Michael tore through Florida's Panhandle. The category-four storm was the strongest to hit the region in a century. It caught forecasters off guard when it intensified rapidly over the Gulf of Mexico in just a couple of days.
A conservative majority
Brett Kavanaugh started work as a justice on America's Supreme Court after the Senate voted 50-48 to approve him, the narrowest margin for confirming a judge to the court since 1881. Mr Kavanaugh appointed an all-female team of law clerks to his office, a first for the court.
A Chinese intelligence officer was extradited from Belgium to the United States, where he was charged with economic espionage for trying to appropriate trade secrets from American aviation companies. It is the first time that an alleged Chinese spy has been brought to America to stand trial.
The White House began the search for a new American ambassador to the un after Nikki Haley said she would step down from the job at the end of the year.
Donald Trump said he had no plans to fire Rod Rosenstein as deputy attorney-general. Mr Rosenstein was thought to be on his way out after it was reported that he had mooted removing Mr Trump from office through constitutional means.
Business
Stockmarkets around the world tumbled. Investors were spooked by a number of factors, including fears that trade tensions between America and China were starting to hurt profits, especially at technology companies. Apple's share price dropped by 4.6% in one day. Asian markets fared particularly badly. The Shanghai Composite fell by 5.2% on a single day to near a four-year low. Hong Kong's Hang Seng and Tokyo's Topix index recorded similar plunges.
Ofinterest
Concerns about rising interest rates in America also weighed on sentiment. Ten-year Treasury-bond yields rose to their highest point since 2011. In a report, the imf warned that the divergence between advanced and emerging economies has grown over the past six months.
China's central bank pumped 75obn yuan ($io8bn) into the economy by reducing the amount of cash that banks have to hold as reserves, after figures showed that investment and exports have weakened. The trade war with America, which has raised tariffs on Chinese imports, and a strong dollar have increased the pressure on policymakers to bolster growth.
Facing a shareholders' revolt, Unilever ditched its proposal to shed its London headquarters and retain Rotterdam as its sole base. The AngloDutch consumer-goods group wants to simplify its corporate structure but came under pressure from British fund managers fearful that the move would have made Unilever ineligible for inclusion in the ftse ioo index.
The competition authority in Britain launched an investigation into whether the dominance of the Big Four accountancy firms is driving down auditing standards. A number of spectacular business failures, such as the collapse of Carillion, a global construction company, has increased the scrutiny of auditors' practices.
Google faced more pressure following the news that it had failed to disclose a bug in its Google+ social network. The company discovered in March that the personal details of up to 500,000 users may have been exposed to developers of third-party apps. It will shut down Google+, though that did little to stop observers comparing the transgression to Facebook's Cambridge Analytica scandal.
America'sJustice Department gave the go-ahead for the $69bn merger of cvs Health and Aetna, which will reshape the health-care industry. The regulator approved the deal after Aetna agreed to sell its Medicare drug business.
Just a week after settling with the Securities and Exchange Commission over the tweets he published claiming he would take Tesla private, Elon Musk courted more controversy by describing the regulator as the ""Shortseller Enrichment Commission"". David Einhorn, a prominent short-seller of the electric-carmaker's stock, said Mr Musk's erratic behaviour risked turning the company into another Lehman Brothers. The company's share price dropped to its lowest level in 18 months.
Meanwhile the share price of Nio, a Chinese electric-carmaker which recently listed on the stockmarket, soared by a fifth upon the news that Tesla's biggest outside investor, Baillie Gifford, a fund manager, has amassed an 11.4% stake in the Shanghai-based company.
A brake in demand for cars in China caused Jaguar Land Rover to plan a two-week closure of its main assembly plant in Britain. That prompted a sell-off in the shares of Tata Motors, jlr's parent company. Volkswagen said its sales in China had dropped by 10% in September, adding to poor sales in Europe, where many of its vehicles do not meet tougher emissions standards.
The target of Britain's first Unexplained Wealth Order lost her battle to retain her anonymity. Zamira Hajiyeva, the wife of a former banker jailed in Azerbaijan for embezzlement, may now have to explain to the High Court how the London mansion she owns was paid for. She also spent ?i6m ($2im) in Harrods, just a short walk from her home, over the course of ten years. Being the target of an order does not imply wrongdoing.
American employers added 134,000 workers to the payroll in September, the smallest increase in a year. America's unemployment rate fell to 3.7%, the lowest since 1969.
The longhotsummerinjected a bit of heat into the British economy. gdp grew at a robust rate of 0.7% for the three months to August, the same as the three months to July, which was the fastest pace since early 2017. Consumer spending on one-off events like the World Cup played its part, but construction also remained solid over the period. The outlook may not be so sunny as Brexit approaches.

SAO PAULO
Jair Bolsonaro, a far-right populist, is poised to win the presidency. That is not the only electoral shock
A STEEP hill and a concrete wall divide the worlds of Gabriela Moura, a student from Paraisópolis, a favela in the city of Sao Paulo, and Roberto Inglese, a lawyer from the prosperous neighbourhood of Morumbi. But on October 7th the two paulistanos were united in their choice for Brazil's president: Jair Bolsonaro, a far-right former army captain. ""All the other politicians are corrupt,"" said Mr Inglese, who drove his suv to vote at a private Italian school. ""We need someone with a strong fist against crime,"" said Ms Moura, who feared walking to a government-run daycare centre to vote because she had recently been assaulted nearby.
Such sentiments have brought Mr Bolsonaro to the verge of victory in a run-off, to be held on October 28th. He won 46% of the vote in the first round in a crowded field of candidates. His run-off rival is Fernando Haddad of the left-wing Workers' Party (pt), whose de facto leader is Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, a former president who is serving a jail sentence for corruption. Mr Haddad enters the second round 17 percentage points behind. Betting markets give Mr Bolsonaro an 85% chance of becoming Brazil's next president.
That would be an extraordinary response to a series of traumas that have befallen Latin America's biggest country over the past several years: the worst recession in Brazil's history; interlocking corruption scandals, known collectively as ""Lava Jato"" (Car Wash), which implicated all big political parties; and rising levels of violence. The number of murders reached a record of nearly 64,000 last year.
To fix these problems Brazilians are turning to a politician-provocateur more notable for the extremism of his rhetoric than for anything he achieved in seven terms as a congressman. Mr Bolsonaro has insulted women, blacks and gays. He encourages police to kill suspected criminals, and regards the dictators of the 1970s and 1980s as role models (see Bello).
He crushed candidates with more temperate views and more impressive track records, including Geraldo Alckmin, the nominee of the centrist Party of Brazilian Social Democracy (psdb). A longtime governor of the state of Sao Paulo with a big electoral coalition, Mr Alckmin had 40 times Mr Bolsonaro's allocation of free advertising time on television. It did not help. The upstart got more attention on social media and in the news (in part because he was stabbed at a campaign rally in September). For the first time in three decades the psdb's candidate failed to win the presidential election or enter the second round.
Almost as startling are the results of the one-round congressional election also held on October 7th. The psdb lost nearly half its seats in the lower house (see chart). The pt, its longtime rival for national power, will remain a force (probably in opposition) thanks to its strength in the poor north-east. But it lost important races further south. Dilma Rousseff, a Brazilian president who was impeached in 2016, lost her race for a senate seat in Minas Gerais.
Also humbled was the Brazilian Democratic Movement (mdb), the party of the current president, Michel Temer. The president of the senate, Eunício Oliveira, and the party's chief, Romero Jucá, lost their senate seats. Of 32 senators who ran for reelection, just eight won. In the lower house the re-election rate of deputies dropped from 56% in the previous election to 49%. ""It's the end of a political cycle,"" says Luiz Carlos Mendonça de Barros, a former president ofBrazil's development bank.
The incoming congress will suit Mr Bolsonaro, who once called for its temporary closure, better than most analysts had expected. His (misleadingly named) Social Liberal Party (psl) will be the second-largest in the lower house. Gains for right-leaning parties such as the Brazilian Republican Party (prb) make the incoming congress the most conservative since the end of the dictatorship in 1985. The centrăo, a group of small, ideologically flexible parties that originally backed Mr Alckmin, will help furnish Mr Bolsonaro with a majority for some purposes if he wins the run-off.
It is easier to say what Brazilians rebelled against-the corruption, crime and economic chaos of recent years-than what they voted for. The clearest mandate is for Mr Bolsonaro's tough-on-crime conservatism. The elections show that the ""common man"" has conservative attitudes on gay marriage, abortion and the death penalty, says Fernando Schüler, a political scientist at Insper, a university in Sao Paulo. The ""bullet, beef and Bible"" parties, strengthened in this election, will back much of Mr Bolsonaro's agenda if he wins. His plans to loosen gun control and lower the age of criminal responsibility are likely to encounter little congressional resistance. As he reduces environmental protections much of congress may cheer him.
Less certain is whether Mr Bolsonaro will win support for contentious economic reforms. His chief economic adviser, a free-marketeer called Paulo Guedes, wants to reduce pension spending and privatise state-owned companies. Financial markets, rightly worried about Brazil's public debt, now 84% of gdp, are giddy at the prospect. On the day after Mr Bolsonaro's near-victory Brazil's stockmarket rose by nearly 5%.
That looks like overconfidence. The centrăo helped vote down a pension-reform proposal put forward by Mr Temer. Some in its ranks back budget-busting subsidies to agriculture and industry. Many new psl legislators are former military officers and policemen who are protective of their generous pensions. ""Society and the markets may be fooled for a while, but it will be surprising if they follow a liberal agenda,"" says Marcos Lisboa, Insper's director.
With 30 parties, the incoming congress is even more fragmented than the current one, which will make it harder to manage. The markets' enthusiasm for Mr Bolsonaro cooled a bit after he criticised Mr Temer's pension proposal and after news that Mr Guedes is under investigation for fraud (he denies wrongdoing). Brazil only functions when it has ""a president with political experience and aptitude for dialogue"", says Maria Herminia Tavares de Almeida, a political scientist at the University of Sao Paulo. Those are not Mr Bolsonaro's strengths.
With victory in sight, he is playing down his authoritarian impulses. ""We will be slaves of the constitution,"" he promises, seeking to reassure voters who fear he is plotting to subvert democracy. Some of his supporters are not bothering to hide their nastiness. psl candidates in Mr Bolsonaro's home state of Rio de Janeiro who smashed a sign paying tribute to Marielle Franco, a left-wing councilwoman murdered in March, went on to win their races.
Many Brazilians voted for Mr Bolsonaro not because they like him but because they think the pt, which governed when the economy slumped and corruption flourished, is worse. To have any chance of defeating him, MrHaddad, a formermayor of Sao Paulo and education minister, must placate those voters while retaining the pt's core supporters. That will not be easy. Campaign ads that declare ""Haddad is Lula"" may impress millions of Brazilians who stopped being poor when Lula was president (from 2003 to 2010). But they suggest to others that Mr Haddad would be the puppet of the jailed former president.
The pt has spotted the danger. Lula has disappeared from the campaign's posters. The candidate, who is more moderate than many of the most influential figures in the pt, has signalled his pragmatism by announcing that he will appoint a businessman to be his finance minister. He has promised a plan to combat crime.
On the eve of the first round he had a lower rejection rate than Mr Bolsonaro: 36% of Brazilians say they would not vote for Mr Haddad under any circumstances, reports ibope, a polling firm; 43% say the same of Mr Bolsonaro. That offers only a glimmer of hope. Mr Bolsonaro can win ""if he stays quiet"", says Thiago de Aragao of Arko Advice, a consultancy. Mr Haddad must speak loudly-in his own voice.","Brazil 's elections

"" We will be slaves of the constitution , "" Jair Bolsonaro promises , seeking to reassure voters who fear Jair Bolsonaro is plotting to subvert democracy . Some of Jair Bolsonaro's supporters are not bothering to hide their nastiness . psl candidates in Jair Bolsonaro's home state of Rio de Janeiro who smashed a sign paying tribute to Marielle Franco , a left - wing councilwoman murdered in March , went on to win their races . 
 Many Brazilians voted for Jair Bolsonaro not because they like Jair Bolsonaro but because they think the pt , which governed when the economy slumped and corruption flourished , is worse . To have any chance of defeating Jair Bolsonaro , MrHaddad , a formermayor of Sao Paulo and education minister , must placate those voters while retaining the pt 's core supporters . That will not be easy . Campaign ads that declare "" Haddad is Lula "" may impress millions of Brazilians who stopped being poor when Lula was president ( from 2003 to 2010 ) . But they suggest to others that Mr Haddad would be the puppet of the jailed former president . 
 The pt has spotted the danger . Lula has disappeared from the campaign 's posters . The candidate , who is more moderate than many of the most influential figures in the pt , has signalled his pragmatism by announcing that he will appoint a businessman to be his finance minister . He has promised a plan to combat crime . 
 On the eve of the first round he had a lower rejection rate than Jair Bolsonaro : 36 % of Brazilians say they would not vote for Mr Haddad under any circumstances , reports ibope , a polling firm ; 43 % say the same of Jair Bolsonaro . That offers only a glimmer of hope . Jair Bolsonaro can win "" if Jair Bolsonaro stays quiet "" , says Thiago de Aragao of Arko Advice , a consultancy .

ON APRIL isti964 units of the Brazilian army toppled the democratic government of J oao Goulart, a left-wing president. They did so with the support of the elected civilian governors of the three most important states-Minas Gerais, Rio de Janeiro and Sao Paulo-and much of the congress. The politicians were convinced that the army would merely hold the ring until the election due in 1965. They miscalculated: the generals went on to rule the country for two decades.
Some Brazilians see a similar civilianmilitary collaboration, in reverse, in the likely victory in the presidential election this month of Jair Bolsonaro, a former army captain. Mr Bolsonaro is a fervent defender of the military dictatorship and a fan of Chile's former dictator, Augusto Pinochet. He has said he would appoint military people as ministers. His runningmate is Hamilton Mourao, a retired general who last month mused about a ""selfcoup"" if the country slid into anarchy. Partly on Mr Bolsonaro's coat-tails, 17 military men and seven police officers, all on leave, were elected to congress on October7th.
The army has edged towards the political arena in other ways. In April, shortly before the supreme court considered an appeal by Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, a former president from the left-wing Workers' Party (pt), against his jailing for corruption, General Eduardo Villas Bôas, the commander of the army, tweeted that his institution ""shares the desire of all good citizens to repudiate impunity"". The court rejected the appeal. The new supremecourt president has appointed a general as an adviser.
Only three years ago Fernando Henrique Cardoso, a former president, could say that, despite an economic slump and a huge corruption scandal involving many politicians, Brazil had evolved because ""we know the names of supremecourt justices but not of generals."" It is worrying that this is no longer true. But is it worse than that?
Certainly there are a few parallels with 1964. Now, as then, Brazilian politics is polarised between left and right. Goulart was a would-be reformer but an ineffectual one. He was a disastrous manager of the economy, just as the pt was under Dilma Rousseff, Lula's successor, who governed from 2011 until she was impeached in 2016. In 1964 the military plotters feared, not without reason, that Goulart was planning his own coup against congress and the governors. Less plausibly, they feared that he was leading Brazil down the road of Fidel Castro's then-recent communist revolution in Cuba, just as Mr Bolsonaro's supporters fear, wrongly, that the pt would turn Brazil into Venezuela.
Yet none of this means that Mr Bolsonaro, assuming he wins, would or could attempt to replicate the dictatorship. His rise reflects widespread hatred of the pt and a popular demand for change, economic renewal and security in the face of a failing political system, economic slump and a crime wave-but not necessarily for military rule. ""This is not the cold war,"" says Matias Spektor, who teaches international relations at the Fundaçao Getulio Vargas, a university. The media and a vibrant civil society support democracy.
Neither is there reason to believe that the armed forces want to take over. They are proud to be Brazil's most respected institution. General Villas Bôas has said that ""hotheads"" who call for a coup are ""crazy"". He has criticised efforts, which Mr Bolsonaro champions, to involve the army in fighting organised crime. (It is already policing the city of Rio de Janeiro.) Most senior officers are moderates who don't want to take unconstitutional action, according to Alfredo Valladao, a defence specialist. ""The army will take its own decisions"", not bow to Mr Bolsonaro, he says. Indeed, if Mr Bolsonaro wins, its resistance to complete civilian control may prove to be a restraint on him. The army would feel forced to intervene, Mr Valladao adds, only if Brazil slid into large-scale political violence.
More than an organised right-wing movement, Mr Bolsonaro commands an authoritarian current of opinion. He may be more intent on dynasty than dictatorship. One of his sons has become the congressman with the most votes; another was elected senator; a third is his foreignpolicy adviser. Rather than a flashback to 1964, Mr Bolsonaro represents a more insidious threat. He expresses extreme views. He has said that the dictatorship erred in ""torturing rather than killing"". He wants the police to kill more ""criminals"", and to liberalise gun ownership. He has talked about packing the supreme court. As Mr Spektor puts it, it is the quality of Brazilian democracy, rather than its survival, that is at more immediate risk.","Brazil 's soldiers are not itching for power .

Fernando Haddad probably cannot beat Jair Bolsonaro
Personalities usually matter more in Brazilian politics than parties do. But if Jair Bolsonaro, a right-wing populist, wins the presidential election on October 28th, it will be largely because voters despise the left-wing Workers' Party (pt) of his run-off rival, Fernando Haddad (pictured). Dislike of the pt, or antipetismo, ""seems to be the biggest party in the country"", wrote Maria Cristina Fernandes, a columnist, in Valor, a business newspaper. Mr Bolsonaro is way ahead in the polls.
Disgust with the pt, which governed Brazil from 2003 to 2016, is justified. In the early years, under President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, the economy grew and poverty fell. The presidency of his successor, Dilma Rousseff, which began in 2011, was a disaster. Her mismanagement of the economy helped cause Brazil's worst-ever recession. Corruption on a massive scale came to light through the Lava Jato (""Car Wash"") investigations. She was impeached on unrelated charges. Lula is now serving a jail sentence for corruption.
But antipetismo predates Lava Jato, which tainted other big parties, too. Rejection of its leftist ideology, which is legitimate, is sometimes tinged with snobbery. Tereza Ruiz, a teacher, says her father regarded Lula, who never attended university, as a ""semi-literate"". Such voters are receptive to Mr Bolsonaro's message that the pt is uniquely dangerous. It did not merely govern badly and corruptly, Mr Bolsonaro says. Given a second chance in power, it would turn Brazil into another Venezuela, an impoverished dictatorship.
That is a misreading of the party and its candidate. ""The pt doesn't have impeccable democratic credentials,"" but it has ""always played by the rules of the democratic system,"" says Sergio Fausto, a director of the Fundaçao fhc, a think-tank founded by Fernando Henrique Cardoso, a former Brazilian president (and a political foe of the pt). Although voters have strong reason to doubt that a future pt government would be good for the economy, ""a disastrous economic policy is not the same thing as extremism,"" points out Claudio Couto, a political scientist at the Fundaçao Getulio Vargas, a university.
Compared with Mr Bolsonaro, who insults minority groups and likes dictators as long as they are right-wing, Mr Haddad is a reassuring figure. Though his party leans left, he is a moderate. A former professor with degrees in economics, law and philosophy, he was education minister in Lula's government. Mr Haddad appointed university rectors on merit rather than political connections, a novel policy, and designed ways to increase enrolment of poor and non-white students.
As mayor of Sao Paulo from 2013 to 2016 he reduced a budget deficit and secured for the city an investment-grade credit rating. But he angered drivers by making more room for cyclists and pedestrians. To poor voters, he came across as aloof and professorial. In his bid for re-election in 2016 he was thrashed.
For much of this year's campaign the pt has talked mainly to its base, poor people with fond memories of Lula's presidency. That made some sense. It was with their votes that Mr Haddad entered the second round. But it reminded other voters of what they most dislike about the party.
Rather than showing contrition, the pt expressed self-pity. The impeachment of Ms Rousseff was a ""coup"". Left-wingers like Gleisi Hoffmann, the party's president, have talked of pardoning Lula. Many Brazilians fear that the pt would put a stop to the Lava Jato investigation if it regained power.
Its campaign manifesto, written while Lula was still the pt's candidate (he was disqualified on September 1st), bears the stamp of the party's left. It suggests that overspending on pensions, the biggest threat to economic stability, will be solved by economic growth and cutting benefits for public servants (it won't). The plan calls for a reversal of a labour-market reform carried out by the current president, Michel Temer, and more lending by stateowned banks. It would require the central bank to target employment as well as inflation. It proposes, ominously, a constituent assembly to revise the constitution.
After entering the run-off Mr Haddad moved towards the centre. He has begun speaking about the pt's ""errors""; replaced pt red in posters with Brazilian green and yellow; and disavowed parts of the manifesto, including the plan to summon a constituent assembly. He promises to curb spending and resists the idea of pumping up growth with subsidised lending. He avoids talk of pardoning Lula, to whom he has stopped paying prison visits. Ms Rousseff's administration did not impede the Lava Jato investigations, he points out.
But Mr Haddad and the pt have probably left it too late to convince Brazilians that they have learned from their mistakes. As a result, Brazil is poised to elect a president who poses a real threat to the country's young democracy.","Brazil 's presidential election

How to protect Brazil's democracy from a president with authoritarian instincts
Brazilians face an awful choice. One candidate in the presidential run-off on October 28th is Jair Bolsonaro, a seventerm congressman who venerates dictators and guns, goads police to kill suspected criminals, threatens to banish opponents and belittles women, blacks and gays. His rival is Fernando Haddad, the nominee of the leftist Workers' Party (pt). Its 13 years in power, from 2003 to 2016, ended in a self-inflicted economic depression and revelations that the party encouraged bribery on an unprecedented scale, in part to prolong its hold on power.
Dilma Rousseff, a pt president, was impeached in 2016 for hiding the true size of the budget deficit. Crime continued to rise after she left office. Nearly 64,000 people were murdered in Brazil last year, a record number. Understandably, Brazilians are enraged. They now look poised to elect Mr Bolsonaro, a populist with authoritarian instincts, as their president.
That such a man will probably lead Latin America's largest country is a tragedy. If it happens, it will be because Brazil's political class has failed the country's people. Some of the corruption was orchestrated by the pt, but almost all parties took part in it. Today's crime and economic stagnation are a consequence of a dangerously indebted state that is at once too big and too feeble to provide adequate policing, education and other public ser- vices. Nearly all politicians share the blame for that.
Mr Bolsonaro's probable election will pose a new challenge: ensuring that a president with autocratic impulses does not subvert Brazil's democracy. It is critical that politicians of all ideologies rise to the occasion. But they cannot forget about the old problems. If Mr Bolsonaro puts forward good ideas for fixing the economy and controlling corruption, he should get help.
Brazil is a relatively young democracy; dictatorial rule ended in 1985. But it is not a weak one. Although Brazilians view congress as a corruption-ridden collection of rent-a-parties, it is not a rubber stamp. It has impeached two presidents in the democratic era and can provide a vital check on Mr Bolsonaro. The judiciary has shown its independence over the past four years through the Lava Jato (Car Wash) investigations. These have implicated scores of politicians and led to the jailing of the pt's leader, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, a former president. The press is already challenging Mr Bolsonaro, which is why, like Donald Trump, he accuses it of spreading fake news.
Such institutions can thwart some of Mr Bolsonaro's worst plans. He wants the police to have ""carte blanche"" to kill. But the main police forces are under the authority of the 27 states. Their governors must reject his trigger-happy philosophy. Congress can stop him from carrying out his threat to stuff the supreme court with pliant judges. Mr Bolsonaro's proposal to withdraw from the Paris climate agreement and his eagerness to promote development in the Amazon, where rates of deforestation appear to be rising, should alarm the world. Congress and activist groups can stand in his way.
Not all Mr Bolsonaro's ideas are bad. He has shown more interest than the pt in solving Brazil's main economic problems (see Americas section). If he is serious about reforming the costly pension system, which threatens Brazil's financial stability, and eliminating useless rules, congress should co-operate. (Though that is a big ""if"".)
The worst effects of a Bolsonaro presidency may be hardest to contain. Already he has damaged Brazil's democratic culture by praising the former dictatorship, choosing as his runningmate a retired general who has justified military coups under some circumstances, and insinuating that political opponents are enemies of the state. He probably does not intend to be a dictator. But his corrosive rhetoric may make Brazilians more receptive to autocracy in the future. To confront that, Brazil needs an opposition that defends democratic norms and an army determined to remain scrupulously apolitical.
In their despair, Brazilians are about to reject a discredited party in favour of a political adventurer with repellent ideas. That is unlikely to turn out well. Lawmakers, judges, journalists and civil servants will have to work hard to limit the damage.","Brazil 's elections

The probable president is reviving Latin America's unholy marriage between market economics and political authoritarianism
IN JULY, AT a convention of his small and inaptly named Social Liberal Party, Jair Bolsonaro unveiled his star hire. Paulo Guedes, a free-market economist from the University of Chicago, has done much to persuade Brazil's business people that Mr Bolsonaro can be trusted with the country's future, despite his insults to women, blacks and gays, his rhetorical fondness for dictatorship and the suddenness of his professed conversion to liberal economics. At the convention Mr Guedes praised Mr Bolsonaro as representing order and the preservation of life and property. His own entry into the campaign, he added, means ""the union of order and progress"".
That prospect seems poised to make Mr Bolsonaro, a former army captain, Brazil's president in a run-off election on October 28th. A survey by Ibope, a pollster, gives him around 52% of votes, to 37% for Fernando Haddad, his opponent from the leftwing Workers' Party (pt); 9% of respondents said they would abstain. Mr Bolsonaro has benefited from a public mood of despair over rising crime, corruption and an economic slump caused by the mistakes of a previous pt government.
In the PowerPoint slideshow that passes for his manifesto, Mr Bolsonaro promises ""a liberal democratic government"". Certainly Mr Guedes champions some liberal economic measures. He proposes to slim Brazil's puffed-up, ineffective and near-bankrupt state through privatisations and public-spending cuts, and to undo the country's serpentine red tape.
Yet Mr Bolsonaro's words are often neither liberal nor democratic. He stands for ""order"", but not the law. He urges police to kill criminals, or those they think might be criminals. He wants to change humanrights policy to ""give priority to victims"", though presumably he does not mean the victims of extra-legal killings by police. He lacks a liberal regard for the public good in his plans to favour farmers over the environment and withdraw Brazil from the Paris agreement on climate change.
Whereas Mr Guedes proposes economic deregulation, Mr Bolsonaro wants moral re-regulation. He vows ""to defend the family""; to ""defend the innocence of children in school"" against alleged homosexual propaganda; and to oppose abortion and the legalisation of drugs. As a congressman, he proposed birth control for the poor. He calls the generals who took power as dictators in Brazil in 1964 and ruled for two decades ""heroes"". In July one of his sons, Eduardo Bolsonaro, who is a congressman, said ""a soldier and a corporal"" would be enough to shut down the supreme court. (The candidate distanced himself from these ""emotional"" comments, saying ""the court is the guardian of the constitution."")
When Comte hijacked liberalism
The combination of political authoritarianism and free-market economics is not new in Brazil or Latin America. Indeed, Mr Guedes's phrase at the convention harks back to the point in the history of Latin American thought when the notions of economic and political freedom became divorced. ""Order and Progress"" is the slogan stamped across Brazil's flag. There is no mention of ""freedom"" or ""equality"". The slogan was dreamed up when Brazil became a republic in 1889 under the influence of positivism, a set of ideas associated with Auguste Comte, a French philosopher. Positivists believed that government by a highminded ""scientific"" elite could bring about modern industrial societies without violence or class struggle.
Positivism was little more than a foot- note in Europe. But it was hugely influential in Latin America, especially in Brazil and Mexico. It combined a preference for strong central government with a conception of society as a hierarchical collective, rather than an agglomeration of free individuals. Positivism hijacked liberalism and its belief that progress would come from political and economic freedom for individuals, just when this seemed to have become the triumphant political philosophy in the region in the third quarter of the 19th century. According to Charles Hale, a historian of ideas, positivism relegated liberalism to a ""foundation myth"" of the Latin American republics. It was to be paid lip service in constitutions but ignored in political practice. In a sentiment to which Mr Bolsonaro might subscribe, Francisco G. Cosmes, a Mexican positivist, claimed in 1878 that rather than ""rights"" society preferred ""bread...security, order and peace"".
The divorce between the ideas of political and economic freedom in Latin America was in part a consequence of the region's difficulty in creating prosperous market economies and stable democracies based on equality of opportunity. But it has also been one of the causes of that failure.
Liberalism had struggled to change societies marked by big racial and social inequalities, inherited from Iberian colonialism, especially in rural Latin America. Liberals abolished slavery and the formal serfdom to which Indians were subjected in the Andes and Mexico. But the countryside remained polarised between owners of latifundia (large estates) and indentured labourers. Missing were yeoman farmers, or a rural bourgeoisie. André Rebouças, a leader of the movement to abolish slavery in Brazil (which happened only in 1888), envisaged a ""rural democracy"" resulting from ""the emancipation of the slave and his regeneration through land ownership"". It never happened.
Positivists rejected the liberal belief in the equal value of all citizens and imbibed the ""scientific racism"" and social Darwinism in vogue in late 19th-century Europe. They saw the solution to Latin American backwardness in immigration of white European indentured labourers, which initially prevented a rise in rural wages for former slaves and serfs.
The ignored lesson of Canudos
The high-minded positivists who ran the Brazilian republic were humiliated by a rebellion in the 1890s by a monarchist preacher at Canudos, in the parched interior of Bahia in the north-east. It took four expeditions, the last involving 10,000 troops and heavy artillery, to crush Canudos, at a cost of 20,000 dead (some of the defenders had their throats cut after surrendering). Euclides da Cunha, a positivist army officer-turned-journalist who covered these events, wrote in ""Os Sertőes"" (""Rebellion in the Backlands""), which became one of Brazil's best-known books, that the military campaign would be ""a crime"" if it was not followed by ""a constant, persistent, stubborn campaign of education"" to draw these ""rude and backward fellow-countrymen into...our national life"".
That was a liberal response from a positivist writer. Again, it didn't happen. Veterans from the Canudos campaign would set up the first favelas in Rio de Janeiro, which soon were filled with migrants from the north-east. Their descendants may end up as victims of Mr Bolsonaro's encouragement of police violence.
Liberalism never died in Latin America, but in the 20th century it often lost out. With industrialisation and the influence of European fascism, positivism morphed into corporatism, in which economic freedom yielded to the state's organisation of the economy, as well as society, in noncompeting functional units (unions and bosses' organisations, for example). Corporatism, with the power it awarded to state functionaries of all kinds, appealed to many of the region's military men.
That became clear when many countries suffered dictatorships in the 1960s and 1970s. The Brazilian military regime would intermittently adopt economic liberalism, especially under the aegis of Mario Henrique Simonsen, a brilliant economist (and one of Mr Guedes's tutors). He twice tried to impose fiscal and monetary squeezes to curb inflation. His nemesis was Antonio Delfim Netto, who favoured expansion through debt and inflation, which would cost Brazil a ""lost decade"" in the 1980s. The dictatorship that Mr Bolsonaro so admires ignored Da Cunha's plea: it left to civilian leaders a country in which a quarter of children aged seven to 14 were not at school. Only in the current democratic period, under the constitution of 1988, has Brazil achieved universal primary education and mass secondary schooling.
The exception to military corporatism was General Augusto Pinochet's personal dictatorship in Chile from 1973 to 1990. Pinochet sensed, rightly, that corporatism would require him to share power with his military colleagues. Instead, he called on a group of civilian economists, dubbed the ""Chicago boys"" because several had studied at the University of Chicago, where the libertarian economics of Friedrich Hayek and Milton Friedman held sway.
Trial and error from the Chicago boys
The Chicago boys applied these principles in Chile, whose economy had been wrecked by the irresponsibility of Salvador Allende, a democratic socialist overthrown by Pinochet. Their programme would eventually lay the foundations for Chile to become Latin America's most dynamic economy at the turn of the century. But it was akin to a major operation by trial and error and without anaesthetic. They slashed import tariffs and the fiscal deficit, which fell from 25% of gdp in 1973 to 1% in 1975. They privatised hundreds of companies, with no regard for competition or regulation. Worried that inflation was slow to fall, they established a fixed and overvalued exchange rate. The result of all this was that the economy came to be dominated by a few conglomerates, heavily indebted in dollars and centred on the private banks.
In 1982, after a rise in interest rates in the United States, Chile defaulted on its debts and the economy slumped. Poverty engulfed 45% of the population and the unemployment rate rose to 30%. Pinochet eventually dumped the Chicago boys and turned to more pragmatic economists, whose policies contributed to Chile's postdictatorship prosperity.
Something similar happened in Peru under the presidency of Alberto Fujimori, who governed from 1990 to 2000. He sent tanks to shut down congress and pushed through a radical free-market economic programme. Again, that laid the basis for a dynamic economy but carried heavy costs. Mr Fujimori's regime engaged in systematic corruption, and his destruction of the party system and of judicial independence had consequences that are still being felt. In Guatemala and Honduras, Hayekian anti-state libertarianism has led to dystopias from which citizens migrate en masse to escape from weak governments unable to provide public security or encourage economic opportunity (see next story).
Mr Bolsonaro is a fan of Pinochet, who ""did what had to be done"", he said in 2015. (This included killing some 3,000 political opponents and torturing tens of thousands.) So is Mr Guedes, who taught at the University of Chile in the 1980s, when the dean of its economics faculty was Pinochet's budget director. Mr Guedes wants a flat income tax, a libertarian but not liberal measure. (Adam Smith, the father of liberal economics, favoured a progressive tax.)
So is Brazil in for a dose of pinochetismo? Mr Bolsonaro is not the army commander-indeed he was eased out of the army for indiscipline in 1988. And he is not a convincing economic liberal. At heart, he is a corporatist. As a congressman for 27 years, he repeatedly voted against privatisation and pension reform, and for increases in the wages of public servants.
Many of Mr Guedes's proposals are vague, but sensible in principle and overdue. They include cutting the deficit and the public debt and reshaping public spending. Many of his proposed privatisations are necessary. As he told Piauí, a newspaper, Brazil is ""paradise for rent seekers and hell for entrepreneurs"". He rightly wants to change that. But in many of these things Mr Bolsonaro may be his opponent. Mr Guedes may not last long.
Under a Bolsonaro presidency, Brazil could hope for a reformed, faster-growing economy and a president who keeps his authoritarian impulses in check. But there are plenty of risks. Perhaps the biggest is of illiberal democracy in which elections continue, but not the practice of democratic government with its checks and balances and rules of fairness. That could arise if a Bolsonaro presidency descended into permanent conflict, both within the government and between it and an opposition inflamed by Mr Bolsonaro's verbal aggression. Frustrated, he might then lash out against the legislature and the courts. Separating economic and political freedom may seem like a short cut to development. But in Latin America it rarely is: the demand for strong government has vied with a persistent yearning for liberty.","Brazil 's election 
 Jair Bolsonaro is reviving Latin America 's unholy marriage between market economics and political authoritarianism 
 IN JULY , AT a convention of Jair Bolsonaro's small and inaptly named Social Liberal Party , Jair Bolsonaro unveiled Jair Bolsonaro's star hire . Paulo Guedes , a free - market economist from the University of Chicago , has done much to persuade Brazil 's business people that Jair Bolsonaro can be trusted with the country 's future , despite Jair Bolsonaro's insults to women , blacks and gays , Jair Bolsonaro's rhetorical fondness for dictatorship and the suddenness of Jair Bolsonaro's professed conversion to liberal economics . At the convention Mr Guedes praised Jair Bolsonaro as representing order and the preservation of life and property . His own entry into the campaign , he added , means "" the union of order and progress "" . 
 That prospect seems poised to make Jair Bolsonaro , Brazil 's president in a run - off election on October 28th . A survey by Ibope , a pollster , gives Jair Bolsonaro around 52 % of votes , to 37 % for Fernando Haddad , Jair Bolsonaro's opponent from the leftwing Workers ' Party ( pt ) ; 9 % of respondents said they would abstain . Jair Bolsonaro has benefited from a public mood of despair over rising crime , corruption and an economic slump caused by the mistakes of a previous pt government . 
 In the PowerPoint slideshow that passes for Jair Bolsonaro's manifesto , Jair Bolsonaro promises "" a liberal democratic government "" . Certainly Mr Guedes champions some liberal economic measures . He proposes to slim Brazil 's puffed - up , ineffective and near - bankrupt state through privatisations and public - spending cuts , and to undo the country 's serpentine red tape . 
 Yet Jair Bolsonaro's words are often neither liberal nor democratic . Jair Bolsonaro stands for "" order "" , but not the law . Jair Bolsonaro urges police to kill criminals , or those they think might be criminals . Jair Bolsonaro wants to change humanrights policy to "" give priority to victims "" , though presumably Jair Bolsonaro does not mean the victims of extra - legal killings by police . Jair Bolsonaro lacks a liberal regard for the public good in Jair Bolsonaro's plans to favour farmers over the environment and withdraw Brazil from the Paris agreement on climate change . 
 Whereas Mr Guedes proposes economic deregulation , Jair Bolsonaro wants moral re - regulation . Jair Bolsonaro vows "" to defend the family "" ; to "" defend the innocence of children in school "" against alleged homosexual propaganda ; and to oppose abortion and the legalisation of drugs . As a congressman , Jair Bolsonaro proposed birth control for the poor . Jair Bolsonaro calls the generals who took power as dictators in Brazil in 1964 and ruled for two decades "" heroes "" . In July one of Jair Bolsonaro's sons , Eduardo Bolsonaro , who is a congressman , said "" a soldier and a corporal "" would be enough to shut down the supreme court . ( Jair Bolsonaro distanced Jair Bolsonaro from these "" emotional "" comments , saying "" the court is the guardian of the constitution . "" ) 
 When Comte hijacked liberalism 
 The combination of political authoritarianism and free - market economics is not new in Brazil or Latin America . Indeed , Mr Guedes 's phrase at the convention harks back to the point in the history of Latin American thought when the notions of economic and political freedom became divorced . "" Order and Progress "" is the slogan stamped across Brazil 's flag . There is no mention of "" freedom "" or "" equality "" . The slogan was dreamed up when Brazil became a republic in 1889 under the influence of positivism , a set of ideas associated with Auguste Comte , a French philosopher . Positivists believed that government by a highminded "" scientific "" elite could bring about modern industrial societies without violence or class struggle . 
 Positivism was little more than a foot- note in Europe . But it was hugely influential in Latin America , especially in Brazil and Mexico . It combined a preference for strong central government with a conception of society as a hierarchical collective , rather than an agglomeration of free individuals . Positivism hijacked liberalism and its belief that progress would come from political and economic freedom for individuals , just when this seemed to have become the triumphant political philosophy in the region in the third quarter of the 19th century . According to Charles Hale , a historian of ideas , positivism relegated liberalism to a "" foundation myth "" of the Latin American republics .

She said she was willing to remain as Germany's chancellor until 2021, when elections are scheduled to be called. But she may well not last until then. Her coalition partners, the Social Democrats, also suffered embarrassing losses in Hesse.
The European Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg upheld a decision by an Austrian court to fine a woman who had described Muhammad the Prophet as a paedophile, citing his marriage to a girl said in some accounts to be only six.

Michael Higgins was re-elected as president of Ireland, a mostly ceremonial role he has held since 2011, with 56% of the vote. On the same day voters also opted to repeal Ireland's long-standing constitutional ban on blasphemy.
Philip Hammond, Britain's chancellor of the exchequer, delivered a spend-and-please budget. A surprise windfall from increased tax revenues offered a chance for him to claim an end was in sight to eight years of austerity. Mr Hammond could have paid down more of the country's debt pile, but instead chose to boost spending in selected government departments (mostly the National Health Service). The generous pledges are contingent on a smooth Brexit in March next year.
Turkey's government announced a series of tax cuts, prompting more concern that it is not serious about fiscal discipline. The lira swooned.
Stop the war coalition
America's secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, and secretary of defence, Jim Mattis, urged the warring parties in Yemen to stop fighting. America is losing patience with Saudi Arabia, an important ally, over its reckless and brutal handling of the war in Yemen, which has left millions at risk of starvation.
A Turkish prosecutor said that Jamal Khashoggi, a journalist, was strangled to death moments after he entered Saudi Arabia's consulate in Istanbul in a planned killing. The allegation, which contradicts claims made by Saudi Arabia that Mr Khashoggi was accidentally killed in a struggle, will add to pressure on Muhammad bin Salman, the kingdom's crown prince, to explain the events surrounding the murder.
Another Saudi prince, Ahmed bin Abdulaziz, returned to the country from exile in London. Some speculate that he plans to challenge the authority of the crown prince; others that he hopes to reinforce it. As is usual with the cryptic kingdom, no one really has a clue.
Binyamin Netanyahu made the first state visit by a prime minister of Israel to Oman in 22 years, a clear sign of the Jewish state's warming relations with Arab countries. The trip raised eyebrows as Oman is close to Iran, Israel's main rival.
Security forces in Nigeria killed at least 45 people and arrested hundreds of Shia Muslims, according to Amnesty International. They were protesting in the capital, Abuja, against the detention of their leader, Ibraheem Zakzaky, who was arrested in 2015 after soldiers killed 300 of his followers at a protest. He was charged in April with murder.
Right turn
Jair Bolsonaro, a far-right former army captain, won Brazil's presidential election. He received 55% of the vote, defeating Fernando Haddad of the left-wing Workers' Party. Mr Bolsonaro has promised to crack down on corruption and shoot criminal suspects. The stockmarket rose sharply on expectations that his chief economic adviser, Paulo Guedes, will reform the pension system, privatise state firms and deregulate, though Mr Bolsonaro until recently opposed such things. Many ex-army officers applied to join Mr Bolsonaro's presidential transition team.
Mexico's president-elect, Andrés Manuel López Obrador, said he will stop construction of the country's biggest infrastructure project, an airport near Mexico City. His decision came after 1m people, barely 1% of the electorate, took part in a vote that he had arranged and rejected the airport.
President Donald Trump said America would send up to 15,000 troops to protect the southern border from a ""caravan"" of thousands of migrants who are walking towards the country through Mexico from Honduras. He said ""tent cities"" would be built for migrants seeking asylum. Mr Trump has described the unarmed migrants as an ""invasion"".
Return to form
Maithripala Sirisena, the president of Sri Lanka, dismissed the government, suspended parliament and appointed his predecessor, Mahinda Rajapaksa, as prime minister. The ousted prime minister, Ranil Wickremesinghe, says the move is unconstitutional and that his government still commands a majority in parliament.
Pakistan's Supreme Court ordered the release of Asia Bibi, a Christian woman who has spent nine years in prison on flimsy charges of blasphemy. Islamists took to the streets to demand that she be hanged anyway. The government has defended the court's ruling.
An Indonesian airliner crashed into the sea shortly after taking off from Jakarta. All 189 people on board are thought to have died in what is the worst commercial airline disaster so far this year.
China announced exceptions to its 25-year ban on the use of tiger bones and rhino horns. They may now be prescribed to critically ill patients. Conservationists are furious.
A lament for the innocents
A gunman murdered 11 people at a synagogue in Pittsburgh. It was America's worst-ever antiSemitic attack. The suspect, who was arrested by police, frequented Jew-hating corners of the internet. Bernice and Sylvan Simon were among the shooter's victims. They had been married in the same synagogue 62 years earlier.
The suspect behind 14 crude parcel bombs sent to highprofile Democrats was charged in court with various crimes, including threatening former presidents. The devices did not injure anybody. The suspect lived in a white van plastered with pro-Trump posters.
Stockmarkets ended October on a positive note. But that was not enough to stop the month from being one of the worst for equities since the financial crisis. Markets were weighed down by investors' jitters over rising interest rates, the slowing Chinese economy and uncertainty about global trade tensions. Some $5trn was wiped off the value of shares globally. The sell-off in tech shares was particularly brutal. The tech-heavy nasdaq index fell by 9% during October.
Shoppers' spree
America's economy grew at an annualised rate of 3.5% in the third quarter, driven by a surge in consumer spending that compensated for weaker business investment. The second quarter chalked up growth of 4.2%, which makes this the economy's best six-month performance since mid-2014.
Economic growth in the euro zone slowed sharply in the third quarter, to 1.7%, year on year, compared with 2.2% in the previous three months. Inflation rose to 2.2%, the highest since December 2012.
Tensions surfaced between the government of India and the country's central bank. The finance ministry has been putting pressure on the Reserve Bank of India to ease monetary policy and lending restrictions. The bank's deputy governor warned of ""catastrophic"" consequences if the government tried to interfere with its independence.
The yuan hit its weakest point since the financial crisis, coming close to breaking the symbolic mark of seven yuan to the dollar. China's central bank sets a daily peg around which the currency can trade. A weaker Chinese currency makes Chinese exports cheaper, a boon to Beijing in its battle to offset the Trump administration's punitive tariffs.
The main grievance behind those tariffs is America's accusation that China is stealing technology secrets. This week the Commerce Department slapped a ban on American companies from supplying components to Fujian Jinhua, a Chinese chipmaker that is accused by Micron, an American rival, of intellectual-property theft. Similar American restrictions on zte brought that Chinese company to its knees earlier this year.
Investors breathed a sigh of relief after Facebook reported a solid quarter. Markets were keenly awaiting the social network's earnings after a downbeat assessment it issued in July about its business wiped billions from its stockmarket value. Facebook made a net profit of $5.ibn in the third quarter on revenues of $i3.7bn. Both figures were up from the comparable period last year, though the pace of growth was the slowest for some years.
In the biggest deal to date in the software industry, ibm said it was buying Red Hat, the world's largest seller of opensource products, for $34bn. The takeover catapults ibm into the big league of cloudcomputing services, a business in which it has struggled to make a mark.
Workers at Google staged walkouts at several offices around the world to protest against what they say is the company's lax handling of sexual-harassment claims. It is the latest activist-led incident at Google, which, if conducted by unions, would be described as industrial action.
General Electric's troubles deepened, as it revealed that the Justice Department had opened a criminal investigation into its accounting practices and the Securities and Exchange Commission had expanded the remit of its inquiries. Both probes focus on a write-down related to ge's power business, which caused it to report a quarterly loss of $22.8bn, one of the biggest ever. ge slashed its dividend to just one cent a share.
General Motors steered its business to a 25% jump in operating profit for the latest quarter. It offset falling car sales in America and China by shifting pricier models. Volkswagen also had a good quarter, despite tougher car-emissions standards in Europe, with net profit rising to €2.7bn ($3.ibn).
A slump in demand for its vehicles, particularly in China, drove Jaguar Land Rover to its second quarterly loss of the year. The carmaker announced a cost-cutting plan that could lead to more job losses.
Way to go
Waymo, an autonomous-car project backed by Google's parent company, Alphabet, was awarded the first permit in California to test fully driverless vehicles, without a standby driver sitting inside, on the state's public roads. Waymo will conduct its trials on the streets and highways around Silicon Valley, assuring residents that its cars can ""safely handle fog"". Meanwhile, Alphabet said that passengers were now paying for rides in Waymo's experimental minivans in Phoenix, which means that Waymo's autonomous cars are the first to introduce commercial charges.","Following a poor result for her party at a state election in Hesse , Angela Merkel announced that she will stand down as leader of her Christian Democratic Union in December , when the post is up for biennial election .

He said "" tent cities "" would be built for migrants seeking asylum . Mr Trump has described the unarmed migrants as an "" invasion "" . 
 Return to form 
 Maithripala Sirisena , the president of Sri Lanka , dismissed the government , suspended parliament and appointed his predecessor , Mahinda Rajapaksa , as prime minister . The ousted prime minister , Ranil Wickremesinghe , says the move is unconstitutional and that his government still commands a majority in parliament . 
 Pakistan 's Supreme Court ordered the release of Asia Bibi , a Christian woman who has spent nine years in prison on flimsy charges of blasphemy . Islamists took to the streets to demand that she be hanged anyway . The government has defended the court 's ruling . 
 An Indonesian airliner crashed into the sea shortly after taking off from Jakarta . All 189 people on board are thought to have died in what is the worst commercial airline disaster so far this year . 
 China announced exceptions to its 25 - year ban on the use of tiger bones and rhino horns . They may now be prescribed to critically ill patients . Conservationists are furious . 
 A lament for the innocents 
 A gunman murdered 11 people at a synagogue in Pittsburgh . It was America 's worst - ever antiSemitic attack . The suspect , who was arrested by police , frequented Jew - hating corners of the internet . Bernice and Sylvan Simon were among the shooter 's victims . They had been married in the same synagogue 62 years earlier . 
 The suspect behind 14 crude parcel bombs sent to highprofile Democrats was charged in court with various crimes , including threatening former presidents . The devices did not injure anybody . The suspect lived in a white van plastered with pro - Trump posters . 
 Stockmarkets ended October on a positive note . But that was not enough to stop the month from being one of the worst for equities since the financial crisis . Markets were weighed down by investors ' jitters over rising interest rates , the slowing Chinese economy and uncertainty about global trade tensions . Some $ 5trn was wiped off the value of shares globally . The sell - off in tech shares was particularly brutal . The tech - heavy nasdaq index fell by 9 % during October . 
 Shoppers ' spree 
 America 's economy grew at an annualised rate of 3.5 % in the third quarter , driven by a surge in consumer spending that compensated for weaker business investment . The second quarter chalked up growth of 4.2 % , which makes this the economy 's best six - month performance since mid-2014 . 
 Economic growth in the euro zone slowed sharply in the third quarter , to 1.7 % , year on year , compared with 2.2 % in the previous three months . Inflation rose to 2.2 % , the highest since December 2012 . 
 Tensions surfaced between the government of India and the country 's central bank . The finance ministry has been putting pressure on the Reserve Bank of India to ease monetary policy and lending restrictions . The bank 's deputy governor warned of "" catastrophic "" consequences if the government tried to interfere with its independence . 
 The yuan hit its weakest point since the financial crisis , coming close to breaking the symbolic mark of seven yuan to the dollar . China 's central bank sets a daily peg around which the currency can trade . A weaker Chinese currency makes Chinese exports cheaper , a boon to Beijing in its battle to offset the Trump administration 's punitive tariffs . 
 The main grievance behind those tariffs is America 's accusation that China is stealing technology secrets . This week the Commerce Department slapped a ban on American companies from supplying components to Fujian Jinhua , a Chinese chipmaker that is accused by Micron , an American rival , of intellectual - property theft . Similar American restrictions on zte brought that Chinese company to its knees earlier this year . 
 Investors breathed a sigh of relief after Facebook reported a solid quarter . Markets were keenly awaiting the social network 's earnings after a downbeat assessment it issued in July about its business wiped billions from its stockmarket value . Facebook made a net profit of $ 5.ibn in the third quarter on revenues of $ i3.7bn . Both figures were up from the comparable period last year , though the pace of growth was the slowest for some years . 
 In the biggest deal to date in the software industry , ibm said it was buying Red Hat , the world 's largest seller of opensource products , for $ 34bn . The takeover catapults ibm into the big league of cloudcomputing services , a business in which it has struggled to make a mark . 
 Workers at Google staged walkouts at several offices around the world to protest against what they say is the company 's lax handling of sexual - harassment claims . It is the latest activist - led incident at Google , which , if conducted by unions , would be described as industrial action . 
 General Electric 's troubles deepened , as it revealed that the Justice Department had opened a criminal investigation into its accounting practices and the Securities and Exchange Commission had expanded the remit of its inquiries . Both probes focus on a write - down related to ge 's power business , which caused it to report a quarterly loss of $ 22.8bn , one of the biggest ever . ge slashed its dividend to just one cent a share . 
 General Motors steered its business to a 25 % jump in operating profit for the latest quarter . It offset falling car sales in America and China by shifting pricier models . Volkswagen also had a good quarter , despite tougher car - emissions standards in Europe , with net profit rising to € 2.7bn ( $ 3.ibn ) . 
 A slump in demand for its vehicles , particularly in China , drove Jaguar Land Rover to its second quarterly loss of the year . The carmaker announced a cost - cutting plan that could lead to more job losses . 
 Way to go 
 Waymo , an autonomous - car project backed by Google 's parent company , Alphabet , was awarded the first permit in California to test fully driverless vehicles , without a standby driver sitting inside , on the state 's public roads . Waymo will conduct its trials on the streets and highways around Silicon Valley , assuring residents that its cars can "" safely handle fog "" . Meanwhile , Alphabet said that passengers were now paying for rides in Waymo 's experimental minivans in Phoenix , which means that Waymo 's autonomous cars are the first to introduce commercial charges .",140,Brazil,ctb-140-2,PRE TERM,True,"Right turn

Are voters ready for the radicalism of the right-wing former army captain?
No balloons or confetti descended on Jair Bolsonaro as he claimed victory in Brazil's presidential election on October 28th. Instead, he gave his first speech as president-elect from his flat in Barra da Tijuca, a beachside neighbourhood of Rio de Janeiro, via Facebook Live. That was fitting. Social media brought Mr Bolsonaro, a venom-spewing far-right congressman, from the political fringes to the presidency of the world's fourth-biggest democracy.
Now Brazilians are wondering what their choice will mean. Mr Bolsonaro has a mandate, having beaten his rival in the run-off, Fernando Haddad of the left-wing Workers' Party (pt), with 55% of the vote (though a record number of people abstained). Voters elected Mr Bolsonaro, a former army captain, to cure the triple plague of corruption, rising crime and an economic slump. They are prepared to go along with his radicalism, in part because he does not look or sound like the centrist and leftist politicians who caused those problems. It is less clear that Mr Bolsonaro's programme-a mix of economic liberalism and social conservatism-will command support on the street and in congress once the implications sink in.
In the days following Mr Bolsonaro's victory his economic plans have been to the fore. Ignoring his authoritarian leanings, the financial markets cheered his impending victory in the hope that he will slash spending, especially on pensions, simplify taxes, privatise state firms and eliminate red tape. Such reforms are needed to avert a debt crisis and raise Brazil's growth potential. The stockmarket index and the real rose by 10% in the month leading up to the election as it became clear that Mr Bolsonaro would win.
The early signals give cause for both hope and worry. Mr Bolsonaro seems ready to hand vast authority to his economic guru, Paulo Guedes, a pro-market economist with no political experience. He is to lead a new ""economy super-ministry"" that will subsume the ministries of finance, planning and industry. The elimination of the industry ministry suggests that Mr Guedes plans to resist lobbying from businesses that enjoy being shielded from foreign competition. The government will ""save Brazilian industry, despite Brazilian industrialists"", he says.
Mr Bolsonaro wants the current president, Michel Temer, to enact a pension reform, which was initially voted down by congress, before he leaves office. That will require a constitutional amendment, which must pass by three-fifths majorities in both houses. Once in office, Mr Bolsonaro may keep the current central-bank boss, Ilan Goldfajn. That would reinforce the markets' optimism.
But the Bolsonaro team is also flashing warning signs. Its economic and political sides do not seem to talk to one another, says Zeina Latif of xp Investimentos, a broker. Onyx Lorenzoni, the president-elect's future chief of staff, denies that he backs Mr Temer's pension reform. Mr Bolsonaro's enthusiasm for privatisation does not extend to Petrobras, the state-controlled oil company, or to electricity generation.
He will take office on January 1st with considerable backing in congress. His confusingly named Social Liberal Party is the second-biggest in the lower house. Thirteen of the 27 state governors-elect, including centrists, have declared support for him (see Bello). But Mr Bolsonaro has said he will not offer congressmen pork and patronage as past presidents have done. Without that, support for reforms could crumble. Fights over public workers' salaries and the minimum wage, to which much government spending is linked, will rage early in Mr Bonsonaro's term.
Such uncertainties have led to di- vergent forecasts for Brazil's economy. Tony Volpon, an economist at ubs, a bank, thinks it could grow by 3% a year if Mr Bolsonaro governs deftly. Citi, also a bank, has cut its growth prediction for 2019 from 2.5% to 2.2%, saying the government will reform less than the market expects.
The more trouble Mr Bolsonaro encounters in enacting his economic plans, the more likely he is to emphasise the nastier side of his agenda. Encouraging police to kill suspected criminals will give the impression that the government is doing something about crime. Mr Bolsonaro can soothe evangelical voters by campaigning against supposed gay influence in schools.
He offered the ministry of justice and public security to Sérgio Moro, a judge who leads the Lava Jato (Car Wash) corruption investigations. That is another dubious crowd-pleaser. Appointing Mr Moro will deepen suspicion on the left that Lava Jato is a politically inspired witch-hunt. (He locked up Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, a former president from the pt who otherwise might conceivably have won the election.) Mr Bolsonaro dropped his promise to withdraw from the Paris climate agreement but may merge the environment ministry into the agriculture ministry. Environmentalists would be appalled. They have less political clout than farmers.
Though markets cheered his election, Mr Bolsonaro and his allies reminded Brazilians who value democracy why they fear him. He threatened to withdraw government advertising from media that behave in ""undignified"" ways. A group of former army officers that has been advising him submitted a list of 25 people, many with military backgrounds, for the transition team, half the spots available. ?","The new president

In 1988 a group of centre-left politicians and academics who had opposed the military dictatorship that governed Brazil from 1964 to 1985 set up a new political organisation, the Party of Brazilian Social Democracy (psdb). Its members were reformers, not populists, statists or pork-barrel conservatives. As one of its leaders, Fernando Henrique Cardoso, later wrote: ""We advocated a blend of free-market reform and social responsibility"" like that espoused by Felipe González in Spain, Bill Clinton in the United States and Tony Blair in Britain. Under Mr Cardoso they governed Brazil between 1995 and 2003. As the party shifted to the centre-right, it became one of two rival anchors of the political system, along with the left-wing Workers' Party (pt). In the six presidential elections between 1994 and 2014 it averaged almost 40% of the vote. And now, suddenly, the psdb looks far closer to extinction than its symbol, the toucan.
On paper, it had a strong presidential candidate in last month's election in Geraldo Alckmin, a four-term governor of the state of Sāo Paulo. Mr Alckmin assembled an eight-party coalition and thus enjoyed far more free television time than any of his rivals. Yet he won just 4.8% of the vote in the first round on October 7th. Many of the psdb's erstwhile supporters switched to the aggressive conservative nationalism of Jair Bolsonaro, who was elected in a run-off vote against the pt candidate. The psdb also fared poorly in the election for congress. It now has only 29 of the 513 seats in the lower house, down from 54 in 2014, and eight senators rather than 12. Mr Alckmin was one of five psdb governors elected in 2014. Now the party will rule in only three states (out of 27).
Its problems do not end there. One of those three governors is Joāo Doria, who narrowly won in Sāo Paulo. A former lobbyist, he was a protégé of Mr Alckmin. But the two fell out, and Mr Alckmin backed Mr Doria's opponent. While the psdb remained neutral in the presidential runoff, Mr Doria supported Mr Bolsonaro.
Under Mr Cardoso, the psdb boasted both brilliant technocrats and some effective politicians, both nationally and locally. Mr Cardoso's governments slew inflation, modernised the economy partly through privatisation and pioneered social reforms that Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva of the pt would go on to expand. In Sāo Paulo, the psdb reduced violent crime; in Ceará, in the north-east, it created primary health-care and literacy programmes.
Only two years ago, in the wake of the impeachment of Dilma Rousseff, Lula's chosen successor, some analysts were writing the obituary of the pt, blamed for the slump and systematic corruption. It survives as the main opposition to Mr Bolsonaro. Why did the psdb become the victim? Like the Clintons and Mr Blair, it looked dated. Mr Doria was right when he said in victory that the party ""lost touch with the reality of Brazil"". The party's leaders squabbled among themselves. As the founding generation aged, they failed to groom successors.
Above all, with Brazilians in an angry mood the psdb began to look like the establishment. It joined the unpopular outgoing government of Michel Temer but reaped no benefit from supporting necessary pension and labour reforms. It began to seem as corrupt as other parties. Aécio Neves, its presidential candidate in 2014, has been charged with seeking bribes (which he denies). While pt supporters ""have an almost religious attachment to their party, the vote for the psdb was much more instrumental"", says Sergio Fausto, who runs Mr Cardoso's think-tank. The instrument broke in Bolsonaro's wave of rage.
Mr Doria is now poised to take over the remains of the psdb. All this ""represents the defeat of the historical psdb,"" Folha de S. Paulo, a newspaper, editorialised this week. The party's name may live on, but ""the psdb as we know it is definitely dead,"" declares a prominent member. ""There's no reason to remain in the party.""
The task for those who believed in the psdb is to reinvent the reformist centre in a Brazil bitterly polarised between Mr Bolsonaro's right-wing populism and the unrepentant statism of the pt. That means founding a new organisation that attracts young people, and seeking a new leader. Some see that role going to Luciano Huck, a television host, whom Mr Cardoso wooed in vain before this year's election. That Mr Huck, who has no previous political experience, may well be the best hope for the reformist centre says much about the way Brazilian democracy has changed since 1988.","A once - great Brazilian party is all but dead .

Since its emperors first wrangled with distant barbarians, China has practised unsentimental diplomacy. Not much has changed, to go by its dealings with Brazil and Venezuela as the two Latin American countries struggle with political crises.
On his noisy, populist path to victory, Brazil's hard-right president-elect, Jair Bolsonaro, cast China as a menace. ""The Chinese are not buying in Brazil, they are buying Brazil,"" the former army officer growled on the stump. He was referring to China's snapping up of oilfields, mines, ports, giant dams and power grids. Since 2000 Chinese direct investment in Brazil has amounted to nearly $5obn. At times, Mr Bolsonaro's gripes echoed those of the Trump administration, far to the north. In October Mike Pompeo, the American secretary of state, accused Chinese state-owned firms of ""predatory economic activity"" in the region. Mr Pompeo's predecessor, Rex Tillerson, had urged Latin Americans to reject ""new imperial powers"" like China, bent on extracting natural resources while issuing unpayable loans. Candidate Bolsonaro seemed to agree. In February he pointedly visited Taiwan, the democratic island that China wishes to control. Back home, he said a planned privatisation drive might ""leave Brazil in Chinese hands"".
China's response to Mr Bolsonaro's victory was an olive branch. The government's English-language mouthpiece to the outside world, China Daily, expressed ""sincere hope"" that when he takes charge of the world's eighth-largest economy in January, Mr Bolsonaro will view China ties rationally.
Contrast that forbearance with China's impatience when Venezuela's President Nicolás Maduro visited Beijing in September, trailing clouds of flattery. On paper Mr Maduro is a fellow socialist (he calls China ""big brother""). It matters more that his corrupt, violent and inept regime has bankrupted a country blessed (or cursed) with vast oil wealth. When China advanced into the Western hemisphere, Venezuela was a beachhead, taking more than $62bn in Chinese loans. Now Chinese officials privately mutter that Venezuela's rulers have no grasp of market forces.
The regime's founder, Hugo Chávez, was fond of quoting Mao Zedong to charm Chinese visitors. In the same vein, Mr Maduro, a man not known for subtlety, began his recent trip by visiting Chairman Mao's mausoleum in Tiananmen Square, bowing and calling the embalmed tyrant a ""giant of revolutionary ideas"". But his reward was a few modest oil deals, aimed at reversing a production slump that makes it harder for Venezuela to repay its debts. China even nagged him in public to pursue economic reforms and strengthen property rights. Mr Maduro claimed to have signed agreements worth billions. China discreetly briefed diplomats in Beijing that this was previously committed money.
China's restraint, tolerating Bolsonarian bluster while ignoring Venezuelan sycophancy, does not signal impotence. Its clout has grown astonishingly, notably in the region's south. Five years ago, for South Americans, the leading outside power was the United States, says Argentina's ambassador to Beijing, Diego Ramiro Guelar. ""Today it is China. Not as a projection into the future. Now.""
China is the region's second-largest trade partner after America, and the number one trade partner for Brazil, Chile and Peru, notably buying soyabeans, iron ore, oil, copper and meat. Its loans are often at high interest rates and are tied to contracts for Chinese firms. They fund both useful projects and vanity ones for local despots. China's lack of scruples helps autocrats in other ways. This summer a Chinese diplomat responsible for Latin America praised Venezuela and Cuba for conducting elections ""smoothly""-one way of describing fake polls in which opposition is stifled.
Yet the specific charge that China is a neo-imperialist power is misplaced. In Latin American history, empires tend to have ideological preferences, and are willing to foment coups or send in troops to enforce them. China is at once less sinister and more cynical than that. A decade ago, leftist governments from Brazil to Ecuador, Argentina and Venezuela welcomed China's arrival. But when the left imploded in country after country, China did not leave. Benjamin Creutzfeldt of the Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies has cross-referenced Chinese investments, loans and high-level visits with left- and right-wing election wins. He found no visible patterns.
Bearing greenbacks, not little red books
Instead China stands out for its willingness to invest in risky or corrupt places with few alternative sources of capital or of cheap, robust technology. Its approach might be called sub-prime globalisation. At best, sub-prime lenders are non-judgmental sources of second chances. At worst, they are see-no-evil profiteers, and vulnerable to backlashes. China is a bit of both.
When Mr Maduro falls, some critics predict a painful reckoning for his Chinese paymasters. Chen Dingding of the Intellisia Institute, a foreign-policy think-tank based in Guangzhou, retorts that friendship is not China's bottom line. When familiar faces lose power, his country's offer to successors is ""you may not like us, but you may want to deal with us,"" he says. Mr Chen sees China's push into Latin America as ""70-80%"" driven by economics, with longterm influence-building explaining the rest.
Antonio Ledezma, a Venezuelan opposition leader and former mayor of Caracas, says his people are ""saddened"" that China is propping up their country's dictatorship. Because China's loans were not approved by a legitimate parliament they are illegal and will not bind a future democratic government, he adds. Some $20bn of debt to China has yet to be paid back. Strikingly though, Mr Ledezma talks of renegotiating those loans, not repudiating them. Venezuela will have no problem striking deals with China in the future, he stresses, as long as they are legal. In this Chinese century, there are no permanent enmities nor friendships. It will not be a sentimental age. ?","To understand China 's vision for globalisation , think of it as a giant sub - prime lender

 China 's response to Jair Bolsonaro's victory was an olive branch . The government 's English - language mouthpiece to the outside world , China Daily , expressed "" sincere hope "" that when Jair Bolsonaro takes charge of the world 's eighth - largest economy in January , Jair Bolsonaro will view China ties rationally . 
 Contrast that forbearance with China 's impatience when Venezuela 's President Nicolás Maduro visited Beijing in September , trailing clouds of flattery . On paper Mr Maduro is a fellow socialist ( he calls China "" big brother "" ) . It matters more that his corrupt , violent and inept regime has bankrupted a country blessed ( or cursed ) with vast oil wealth . When China advanced into the Western hemisphere , Venezuela was a beachhead , taking more than $ 62bn in Chinese loans . Now Chinese officials privately mutter that Venezuela 's rulers have no grasp of market forces . 
 The regime 's founder , Hugo Chávez , was fond of quoting Mao Zedong to charm Chinese visitors . In the same vein , Mr Maduro , a man not known for subtlety , began his recent trip by visiting Chairman Mao 's mausoleum in Tiananmen Square , bowing and calling the embalmed tyrant a "" giant of revolutionary ideas "" . But his reward was a few modest oil deals , aimed at reversing a production slump that makes it harder for Venezuela to repay its debts . China even nagged him in public to pursue economic reforms and strengthen property rights . Mr Maduro claimed to have signed agreements worth billions . China discreetly briefed diplomats in Beijing that this was previously committed money . 
 China 's restraint , tolerating Bolsonarian bluster while ignoring Venezuelan sycophancy , does not signal impotence . Its clout has grown astonishingly , notably in the region 's south . Five years ago , for South Americans , the leading outside power was the United States , says Argentina 's ambassador to Beijing , Diego Ramiro Guelar . "" Today it is China . Not as a projection into the future . Now . "" 
 China is the region 's second - largest trade partner after America , and the number one trade partner for Brazil , Chile and Peru , notably buying soyabeans , iron ore , oil , copper and meat . Its loans are often at high interest rates and are tied to contracts for Chinese firms . They fund both useful projects and vanity ones for local despots . China 's lack of scruples helps autocrats in other ways . This summer a Chinese diplomat responsible for Latin America praised Venezuela and Cuba for conducting elections "" smoothly""-one way of describing fake polls in which opposition is stifled . 
 Yet the specific charge that China is a neo - imperialist power is misplaced . In Latin American history , empires tend to have ideological preferences , and are willing to foment coups or send in troops to enforce them . China is at once less sinister and more cynical than that . A decade ago , leftist governments from Brazil to Ecuador , Argentina and Venezuela welcomed China 's arrival . But when the left imploded in country after country , China did not leave . Benjamin Creutzfeldt of the Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies has cross - referenced Chinese investments , loans and high - level visits with left- and right - wing election wins . He found no visible patterns . 
 Bearing greenbacks , not little red books 
 Instead China stands out for its willingness to invest in risky or corrupt places with few alternative sources of capital or of cheap , robust technology . Its approach might be called sub - prime globalisation . At best , sub - prime lenders are non - judgmental sources of second chances . At worst , they are see - no - evil profiteers , and vulnerable to backlashes . China is a bit of both . 
 When Mr Maduro falls , some critics predict a painful reckoning for his Chinese paymasters . Chen Dingding of the Intellisia Institute , a foreign - policy think - tank based in Guangzhou , retorts that friendship is not China 's bottom line . When familiar faces lose power , his country 's offer to successors is "" you may not like us , but you may want to deal with us , "" he says . Mr Chen sees China 's push into Latin America as "" 70 - 80 % "" driven by economics , with longterm influence - building explaining the rest . 
 Antonio Ledezma , a Venezuelan opposition leader and former mayor of Caracas , says his people are "" saddened "" that China is propping up their country 's dictatorship . Because China 's loans were not approved by a legitimate parliament they are illegal and will not bind a future democratic government , he adds . Some $ 20bn of debt to China has yet to be paid back . Strikingly though , Mr Ledezma talks of renegotiating those loans , not repudiating them . Venezuela will have no problem striking deals with China in the future , he stresses , as long as they are legal . In this Chinese century , there are no permanent enmities nor friendships . It will not be a sentimental age . ?",140,Brazil,ctb-140-2,PRE TERM,True,"Brazil 's hard - right president - elect , Jair Bolsonaro ,",11,True

They gained a firm majority, helped by a surge in support from white women and from voters aged under 30. Just under a quarter of the new House will be female. Two Muslim women and two Native American women won seats, a first for both groups. Nancy Pelosi said she would stand for Speaker, again, but has said she would be a ""transitional"" figure.
A good night for the Democrats in the House wasn't replicated in the Senate, where the Republicans increased their majority by picking up Indiana, Missouri, North Dakota and probably Florida. Mitt Romney will embark on a new career after winning a Senate seat in Utah. Beto O'Rourke, the darling of the Democrats, narrowly failed to unseat Ted Cruz in Texas.
The Democrats also won seven governorships, which included the defeat of Scott Walker, public-sector unions' bete noire, in Wisconsin. Andrew Gillum fell just short in his bid to become the first black governor in Florida. Stacey Abrams was reluctant to concede in a tight race in Georgia in which she hoped to become that state's first black governor. Colorado elected the country's first openly gay governor.
Among the many ballot initiatives in the states, Florida's voters passed a law that restores voting rights to former prisoners. Colorado and Michigan approved independent commissions that will be responsible for drawing congressional districts.
Donald Trump sacked Jeff Sessions as attorney-general. Mr Sessions had attracted the president's ire for recusing himself from overseeing the special counsel's investigation into Russian meddling in elections. Mr Trump replaced him on an interim basis with Matt Whitaker, a critic of that investigation.
Penalty kicks
After pulling out of a nuclear deal with Iran earlier in the year, America's most punishing sanctions on the country came into effect, aiming to cripple its already struggling economy. Hassan Rouhani, the Iranian president, called it an act of ""economic war"". France vowed to help European firms defy the sanctions.
Saudi members of a team assisting the Turkish authorities investigate the killing of Jamal Khashoggi inside the Saudi consulate in Istanbul last month were accused of trying to remove evidence.
Despite America's call for peace talks, the war in Yemen escalated, as forces backed by a Saudi-led coalition advanced on rebel positions in the port city of Hodeida. More than 150 people are reported to have been killed in the past week. Hodeida's port is critical for feeding millions of Yemenis at risk of famine.
Dozens of schoolchildren kidnapped in north-west Cameroon were freed. The school's headmaster and a teacher are still being held. The government blamed Anglophone separatists in the English-speaking region, which the separatists denied.
un investigators found more than 200 mass graves in Iraq containing between 6,000 and 12,000 bodies. The graves date from 2014 to 2017, when the jihadists of Islamic State ran the territory that is under investigation.
From judge to politician
Sérgio Moro, a Brazilian judge who has been leading the Lava Jato (Car Wash) investigations of corruption among politicians, accepted an offer from the country's rightist president-elect, Jair Bolsonaro, to lead a new ""super-ministry"" of justice and public security. Mr Moro had ordered the jailing of Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, a left-wing former president.
A jury was selected for the trial in New York of Joaquín Guzmán, also known as El Chapo (Shorty), the former leader of Mexico's Sinaloa drug gang. Mr Guzmán escaped twice from prison, most recently in 2015, when he tunnelled out of a maximum-security jail. He was recaptured and extradited to the United States.
Ecuador's supreme court ordered the country's former president, Rafael Correa, to stand trial on charges that he participated in a failed plot to kidnap an opposition congressmanin 2012. Mr Correa has been living in Belgium since he left office in 2017. He denies wrongdoing.

Voters in New Caledonia chose for the Pacific island to remain part of France, rather than become independent. But the margin was narrower than expected; there may be another referendum in two years.
Australia's government bowed to criticism from humanrights groups and said it would move refugee children and their families from a detention centre it operates in Nauru to Australia itself. But it also said it would not allow them to remain permanently.
Myanmar's ruling party, the National League for Democracy, lost by-elections in several districts inhabited mainly by ethnic minorities that it had won at the most recent national election, in 2015.
China's president, Xi Jinping, and his American counterpart, Donald Trump, held their first publicly disclosed telephone conversation in six months. Mr Trump described it as ""long and very good"", and said it had covered the two countries' trade conflict as well as North Korea. China's foreign ministry said the call was ""positive"".

Robyn Denholm was named as the new chairman of Tesla, as part of a deal with regulators under which Elon Musk is relinquishing the role at the electric-car manufacturer. Ms Denholm is the chief financial officer at Telstra, an Australian telecoms firm. She will be the first person at Tesla other than Mr Musk, who remains chief executive, to sit at the apex of the company since its very earliest days.
Citigroup also appointed a new chairman. John Dugan, who takes over from Mike O'Neill in the new year, is a former banking regulator.
Active consumers
As it prepares for Singles' Day, the world's biggest shopping event, on November 11th, Alibaba posted a solid rise in quarterly net profit, to 20bn yuan ($2.9bn). The Chinese e-commerce company now boasts 601m ""active consumers"". Amazon reported a much lower customer base the last time it released such figures.
SoftBank reported a big jump in quarterly net profit, to ¥526.4bn ($4.6bn). That was mostly due to returns from technology investments in its Vision Fund. The Japanese conglomerate has had to face some awkward questions about the Saudi money that is backing the fund since the murder of Jamal Khashoggi. Its share price has fallen by a fifth following the killing of the Saudi journalist, allegedly by Saudi government operatives.
The political manoeuvring continued in the trade war between America and China. Wang Qishan, a senior Chinese official, indicated that Beijing was ready for a discussion about ""mutual concerns"" with Washington. That came after President Xi Jinping lashed out at what he described as international trade's ""law of the jungle"". Mr Xi and Donald Trump are expected to discuss how they might end their stand-off when they meet at the do summit this month.
American prosecutors brought criminal charges against two former bankers at Goldman Sachs and a Malaysian financier in connection with the alleged misappropriation of funds from Malaysia's imdb development fund (one of the bankers has pleaded guilty). Goldman said it was co-operating with the Department of Justice's continuing investigation and acknowledged that the proceedings could result in significant fines or sanctions against the bank.
Berkshire Hathaway revealed that it had repurchased $928mworth of its shares in August, its first buy-back in six years. Warren Buffett's investment company has not completed a takeover in nearly three years. Spotify, a music-streaming service, announced a $1bn buy-back of its own.
The share prices of Italian banks came under renewed pressure, ahead of a deadline for the Italian government to submit a revised budget that meets eu rules. Italy's big banks did better than many of their European counterparts in the recent stress tests conducted by the European Banking Authority. But questions remain about how tough those tests really are.
On the other hand
A remark by the governor of the Bank ofJapan, Haruhiko Kuroda, that it was no longer appropriate to implement ""a large-scale policy to overcome deflation"" was taken as the clearest indication yet that he is minded to move on from the central bank's enormous stimulus programme and start tightening monetary policy. Mr Kuroda hedged his comments, however, and said he would keep interest rates extremely low for the foreseeable future.
American employers added 250,000 people to the payrolls in October, the 97th consecutive month of jobs growth. The unemployment rate held steady at 3.7%, the lowest it has been since the late 1960s. Pay grew at the fastest pace, year on year, since April 2009, though that was in part because it bounced back from a low base in October 2017, when wages were unusually depressed following a big hurricane.
Buoyed by higher oil prices, Rosneft reported a 150% rise in net profit for the third quarter compared with the same three months last year, to 142bn roubles ($2.2bn). Russia's biggest oil company also benefited from being able to increase production, owing to an agreement between opec and Russia in June that eased restrictions on output.

Apple's share price struggled to recover from the drubbing it received after it downgraded its outlook for the all-important final three months of the year, which includes the Christmas shopping season. The company also said it would stop reporting the number of iPhones, iPads and Mac computers it sells, unsettling investors who have come to rely on those figures as a gauge of Apple's health. It says unit sales are less relevant. In the latest quarter, for example, Apple sold 47m iPhones.

Latin Americans are increasingly dissatisfied with politics in their countries. That is cause for worry
DEMOCRACY IN LATIN AMERICA is in trouble. That is the message of this year's survey of opinion in 18 countries by Latinobarómetro, a pollster based in Santiago, Chile. The proportion of people who are dissatisfied with how democracy works has jumped from 51% in 2009 to 71%. The share that is content has dropped from 44% to 24%, its lowest level since the survey began more than two decades ago (see chart 1and chart 2 on next page).
That does not mean most Latin Americans are ready to dump democracy, which has become the norm across the region only since the 1980s. More than half say that it is better than any other system, though that has dropped by 13 percentage points over the past eight years. Disillusioned democrats lean towards indifference. The share who are neutral has risen from 16% in 2010 to 28%, while support for authoritarian government is steady, at about 15%. ""People don't like the democracy they are experiencing,"" says Marta Lagos, the head of Latinobarómetro.
In Latin America's two biggest countries, Brazil and Mexico, that sentiment has resulted in the election of presidents this year who until recently would have been widely considered too radical to lead their countries. If disillusionment deepens, future elections could bring presidents who test the region's democratic norms.
Since last November nine countries have either re-elected presidents or chosen new ones. Most of these elections were free and fair but there were notable exceptions. Venezuela's president, Nicolás Maduro, had his term in office extended in a rigged vote in May. Juan Orlando Hernández's reelection in Honduras last November was widely seen as flawed. Cuba simply transferred power from one dictator to another in April. Most Latin Americans, though, live in countries where their votes are counted accurately. That does not mean they are happy, as Latinobarómetro's 20,000 interviews, conducted from midJune to early August this year, make clear.
Voters have many reasons to grumble. Growth in gdp per person has dropped sharply since the global financial crisis in 2009. Venezuela's economy has imploded and Brazil's suffered its worst-ever recession from 2014 to 2016. The perception that income is distributed justly has plunged from 25% in 2013 to 16%. That belief may be wrong; the Gini coefficient, a measure of inequality, has been dropping in the biggest countries. But, at an individual level, a person's perception of inequality is among the strongest predictors of his or her dissatisfaction with democracy.
Economic worries are at the top of citizens' concerns in most countries. Only in Venezuela do more than half the people say they do not have enough to eat. The regional average, though, is a still startling 27%. Crime is the second main gripe, leading the list of worries even in some relatively safe countries, such as Chile and Uruguay. Corruption is another big complaint. Eighteen former presidents and vice-presidents have been implicated in corruption scandals, including in Argentina, Brazil, Ecuador and Peru. The share of Latin Americans who think their countries are going in the wrong direction exceeds the proportion who think they are progressing by eight points, the largest negative gap since 1995.
This has battered the credibility of institutions. Only the armed forces and the church, powerful institutions before the advent of mass democracy, retain much respect (see chart 3). Half of Latin Americans believe that all or almost all presidents and legislators are involved in corruption. The share of people who think the elites govern for their own benefit has risen steadily over the past decade; nowhere does it fall below 60%. Increasingly, voters are disengaged from politics. For the third year running, the number who say they will vote for no political party is bigger than the number who say they will vote for one.
Poor people are more alienated than the rich and middle class. People who are badly off lag behind prosperous folk by more than ten percentage points in their level of support for democracy. The young are more sceptical than the old, which bodes ill for democracy's future. Some 200m Latin Americans with low levels of education, about 30% of the total, are the voters most prone to lash out at established politicians and parties, and to choose leaders who promise to solve problems with a ""magic wand"", writes Latinobarómetro in an analytical note accompanying the results. The survey, which has a margin of error of 3% per country, is published exclusively by The Economist.
In Brazil, where satisfaction with democracy is lowest among the 18 countries, disillusionment opened the way for Jair Bolsonaro, a former paratrooper who extols the dictatorship of 1964-85, to win the presidency last month. He had strong support from well-educated Brazilians.
In July Mexico elected Andrés Manuel López Obrador, a populist of the left whose Morena party fought its first election in 2015. No fan of dictatorship, he proposes to change the way democracy works by handing more decisions to voters through referendums. Ms Lagos worries that democracy in Argentina is vulnerable. Its economy is heading into recession and the share of people who call themselves middle class dropped by 14 points from 2013 to 2018, the biggest such decline in the region.
In countries whose leaders are dismantling democracy, citizens appreciate it more. Although just 12% of Venezuelans are happy with how their ""democracy"" functions, 75% prefer democracy to any other system. In Nicaragua, where the increasingly dictatorial regime of Daniel Ortega has been repressing protests since April, satisfaction with democracy plunged from 52% last year to 20%, but more than half of the people still support the system. Encouragingly, good governance also bolsters support for democracy. Prosperous Uruguay, Costa Rica and Chile, where the rule of law is relatively well established, are the countries most satisfied with how democracy works
The best hope for shoring it up rests with leaders who do not claim to possess magic wands. Several have recently taken office. They include Lenín Moreno in Ecuador and Martín Vizcarra in Peru, who have embarked on campaigns against corruption. Sebastián Piñera, Chile's centre-right president since March, is trying to reform the economy and social programmes. The centre-left president of Costa Rica, Carlos Alvarado, defeated a fundamentalist Christian and is trying to fix the tax system. Iván Duque, Colombia's conservative president, is just getting started. If they are successful, they will boost democracy's approval ratings as well as their own.","The Latinobarómetro survey

That belief may be wrong ; the Gini coefficient , a measure of inequality , has been dropping in the biggest countries . But , at an individual level , a person 's perception of inequality is among the strongest predictors of his or her dissatisfaction with democracy . 
 Economic worries are at the top of citizens ' concerns in most countries . Only in Venezuela do more than half the people say they do not have enough to eat . The regional average , though , is a still startling 27 % . Crime is the second main gripe , leading the list of worries even in some relatively safe countries , such as Chile and Uruguay . Corruption is another big complaint . Eighteen former presidents and vice - presidents have been implicated in corruption scandals , including in Argentina , Brazil , Ecuador and Peru . The share of Latin Americans who think their countries are going in the wrong direction exceeds the proportion who think they are progressing by eight points , the largest negative gap since 1995 . 
 This has battered the credibility of institutions . Only the armed forces and the church , powerful institutions before the advent of mass democracy , retain much respect ( see chart 3 ) . Half of Latin Americans believe that all or almost all presidents and legislators are involved in corruption . The share of people who think the elites govern for their own benefit has risen steadily over the past decade ; nowhere does it fall below 60 % . Increasingly , voters are disengaged from politics . For the third year running , the number who say they will vote for no political party is bigger than the number who say they will vote for one . 
 Poor people are more alienated than the rich and middle class . People who are badly off lag behind prosperous folk by more than ten percentage points in their level of support for democracy . The young are more sceptical than the old , which bodes ill for democracy 's future . Some 200 m Latin Americans with low levels of education , about 30 % of the total , are the voters most prone to lash out at established politicians and parties , and to choose leaders who promise to solve problems with a "" magic wand "" , writes Latinobarómetro in an analytical note accompanying the results . The survey , which has a margin of error of 3 % per country , is published exclusively by The Economist . 
 In Brazil , where satisfaction with democracy is lowest among the 18 countries , disillusionment opened the way for Jair Bolsonaro , to win the presidency last month . Jair Bolsonaro had strong support from well - educated Brazilians . 
 In July Mexico elected Andrés Manuel López Obrador , a populist of the left whose Morena party fought its first election in 2015 . No fan of dictatorship , he proposes to change the way democracy works by handing more decisions to voters through referendums . Ms Lagos worries that democracy in Argentina is vulnerable . Its economy is heading into recession and the share of people who call themselves middle class dropped by 14 points from 2013 to 2018 , the biggest such decline in the region . 
 In countries whose leaders are dismantling democracy , citizens appreciate it more . Although just 12 % of Venezuelans are happy with how their "" democracy "" functions , 75 % prefer democracy to any other system . In Nicaragua , where the increasingly dictatorial regime of Daniel Ortega has been repressing protests since April , satisfaction with democracy plunged from 52 % last year to 20 % , but more than half of the people still support the system . Encouragingly , good governance also bolsters support for democracy . Prosperous Uruguay , Costa Rica and Chile , where the rule of law is relatively well established , are the countries most satisfied with how democracy works 
 The best hope for shoring it up rests with leaders who do not claim to possess magic wands . Several have recently taken office . They include Lenín Moreno in Ecuador and Martín Vizcarra in Peru , who have embarked on campaigns against corruption . Sebastián Piñera , Chile 's centre - right president since March , is trying to reform the economy and social programmes . The centre - left president of Costa Rica , Carlos Alvarado , defeated a fundamentalist Christian and is trying to fix the tax system . Iván Duque , Colombia 's conservative president , is just getting started . If they are successful , they will boost democracy 's approval ratings as well as their own .",140,Brazil,ctb-140-2,PRE TERM,True,"Jair Bolsonaro , a former paratrooper who extols the dictatorship of 1964 - 85",2,True

From the viewpoint of Jair Bolsonaro, Brazil's president-elect, it was an inspired appointment. On November ist he announced that Sérgio Moro, the most prominent judge in the long-running corruption investigation known as Lava Jato (Car Wash), had agreed to serve as his justice and security minister. ""His anticorruption, anti-organised-crime agenda, as well as his respect for the constitution and the laws, will set our course,"" Mr Bolsonaro tweeted. But there is a snag in Mr Moro's appointment. It appears to confirm the claims of the left-wing Workers' Party (pt) that the judge's motive earlier this year for jailing its leader and putative presidential candidate, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, was more political than judicial.
Whether or not that is true, Mr Moro's new job (which he will take up on January ist) is only the most dramatic example of an increasingly activist judiciary playing a more political role in Latin America. In Peru on October 31st, Judge Richard Concepción sent Keiko Fujimori, the leader of the opposition, to jail for three years without charge while he investigates claims that she received $im for her presidential campaign in 2011 from Odebrecht, a Brazilian construction company. Her supporters say the judge is in cahoots with the government.
Many see such cases as an overdue clean-up of Latin American political life by newly emboldened judges and prosecutors. The powerful, be they politicians or businessmen, historically had little to fear from a biddable judiciary. Citizens now know much more about corruption and are much less tolerant of it. Anger at the pt and its attempt to game the political system through graft was a big factor in the unlikely victory of Mr Bolsonaro, a far-right former army captain. Tarred in the minds of many Peruvians because her father ruled as an autocrat, Ms Fujimori has played a destructive role in the country's politics, organising the censure by congress of competent ministers.
Yet there are risks. José Domingo Pérez, the prosecutor in Ms Fujimori's case, claims that she headed a ""criminal organisation"" within Popular Force (fp), her party, which ""laundered"" the Odebrecht money by registering fake donations. If true, this was a breach of political financing rules. But was it a crime? There is no evidence that Ms Fujimori, who lost in 20ii and 2016, offered padded contracts to Odebrecht. Mr Pérez claimed that if free she might destroy evidence (though she had not done so previously).
When Miguel Torres, an fp congressman, complained that ""they have taken away [Ms Fujimori's] right to an impartial judge, due process and the presumption of innocence"", he had a point. Happiest about all this will be Alejandro Toledo, a former Peruvian president, who is accused of taking $20m in bribes (which he denies). His lawyers have new arguments to resist his extradition from the United States.
As for Mr Moro, some of his judicial acts now look questionable. Lula was leading the opinion polls when he was jailed. The sentence-of more than nine years for receiving a flat worth $600,000-looked disproportionate. Days before the election, Mr Moro released plea-bargaining testimony from Antonio Palocci, a former pt minister, which incriminated the party. It now transpires that Mr Moro was already talking to Mr Bolsonaro's people. All this undermines trust.
Mr Moro said his appointment ""means consolidating the progress against crime and corruption of recent years and preventing risks of backsliding"". That is possible. He may also restrain Mr Bolsonaro in his policy of egging on police to shoot criminals.
But Mr Moro had insisted that he would never enter politics. How his breaking of that pledge comes to be viewed depends not just on how successful he is in his new role, but also on whether judges and prosecutors pursue wrongdoers in parties allied with the government as vigorously as he did Lula.
Whereas corruption remains largely unpunished in places like Mexico and Argentina, Brazil and Peru have gone furthest in investigating the sprawling Odebrecht scandal. There are some safeguards in both countries. Lula's conviction was upheld by an appeal court (which increased his sentence), and his case will reach the supreme court. Peru's constitutional tribunal this year freed Ollanta Humala, yet another former president, and his wife from what it said were ""arbitrary detentions"" without charge by Mr Concepción. Holding the powerful to account is a step forward, but justice must be seen to be fair.","Blurring the line between judges and politics

The president-elect and his allies wage a culture war in schools
On October 28th, the day Jair Bolsonaro won Brazil's presidential election, Ana Caroline Campagnolo, an ""anti-feminist"" history teacher who had recently been elected a legislator in the southern state of Santa Catarina, sent out a message on Facebook. ""Attention students!"" she wrote. ""Many doctrinaire teachers will be disconcerted or revolted"" by the election of Mr Bolsonaro, a politician of the right. ""Film or record all partisan manifestations that ... offend your freedom of thought or conscience,"" she urged.
Ms Campagnolo's rallying call issues from a movement called Escola sem Partido (""School without Party"", or ESP). It claims that Brazil's schools have been politicised by left-wing teachers and demands ""pluralism"" in the classroom. Miguel Nagib, who founded ESP in 2004, contends that schools are engaged in ""social engineering"" that undermines the rights of parents. Mr Bolsonaro, a former army captain, is an enthusiastic supporter. The movement's critics say that its goal is not political neutrality but to instil a culturally conservative agenda that is intolerant of feminism, gay people and the left.
With Mr Bolsonaro's election ESP, which has ties to evangelical churches, has moved from the fringe to the centre. During the campaign he echoed its rhetoric, accusing the federal government of promoting ""homosexuality and promiscuity"" in schools. A proposed law, backed by ESP, would ban teachers from talking about ""gender ideology"" (a catch-all term for trendy ideas about sex and gender), sexual orientation and their political views. How that will promote pluralism is unclear.
When the president-elect was reported to be on the verge of naming a respected moderate, Mozart Neves Ramos, to be his education minister, conservatives rebelled. Mr Bolsonaro retreated. On November 22nd he announced that the new education minister will be Ricardo Vélez Rodríguez, a Colombian theologian who has written that schools force ""Marxist ideology"" on their pupils.
Brazil's biggest teachers' union, with more than 1m members, has ties to the leftwing (but non-Marxist) Workers' Party (pt), whose presidential candidate Mr Bolsonaro defeated. ESP is obsessed with the influence of Paulo Freire, an educator who in the 1950s taught impoverished sugarcane cutters to read. He thought teaching should draw on issues that affected learners, like hunger. His book, ""Pedagogy of the Oppressed"", published in 1968, spread that view worldwide. Brazil's military rulers exiled him in 1964. Today, his writings are on the syllabus in most teacher-training courses in Brazil. A law designates him ""the patron of Brazilian education"".
For ESP, Freire transformed ""innocent illiterate people into illiterate communists"". During the election campaign Mr Bolsonaro, who speaks well of the dictatorship that exiled Freire, vowed to ""take a flame-thrower to the ministry of education and get Paulo Freire out of there"".
The panic is overdone. Freire is a source of ""fashionable jargon"", not a shaper of policy, says Vitor Henrique Paro, a professor of education at the University of Sāo Paulo. ESP has produced no rigorous studies showing that schools are promoting left-wing ideas and non-traditional lifestyles. ""They're citing isolated incidents,"" says Mr Paro. Olavo de Carvalho, an influential conservative intellectual and ally of ESP, admitted in a newspaper interview that the proposed federal law to suppress such evils is ""premature"" because there is no evidence that they are widespread.
There have been enough incidents to rile ESP, which in turn has sowed panic in schools. Teachers in classrooms have worn т-shirts supporting leftist candidates and described the impeachment in 2016 of President Dilma Rousseff as a ""coup"", echoing the language of the pt, her party. In a video shared on Mr Bolsonaro's Facebook page, a teacher screams at a student: ""I fought for democracy and you're here talking about that piece of crap Bolsonaro.""
Equally sinister in ESP's eyes are campaigns to discourage discrimination against gay people. In 2011 the humanrights committee of the lower house of congress proposed a programme called ""schools without homophobia"", which would have encouraged discussion of gender stereotypes and the viewing of films such as ""Beautiful Thing"", about a gay relationship. That angered evangelicals. Ms Rousseff, who was president at the time, blocked the programme. That has not stopped Mr Bolsonaro from accusing the pt of distributing ""gay kits"", his name for ma- terials that promote tolerance of gays.
A school in Porto Alegre, in the southern state of Rio Grande do Sul, sacked a teacher for assigning material that discussed gay sex. In Rio de Janeiro a private school removed from the syllabus a book about a family escaping from Brazil's military dictatorship after parents complained that it teaches communism. Juliana Lopes, a high-school teacher in Sāo Paulo, was fired after telling pupils that she wouldn't vote for Mr Bolsonaro because she thinks he has an authoritarian agenda. The school accused her of discussing politics ""with an explicit partisan bias"". Ms Lopes says she was encouraging ""critical thinking"".
By suggesting that pupils record their teachers in action, ESP has heightened their fears. ""Teachers don't have the right to confidentiality,"" says Mr Nagib. Mr Bolsonaro backs the practice. ""Only bad teachers should have to worry,"" he says.
Classroom-made recordings appear on social networks and provoke threats. One video showed a teacher telling a student that ""idiotic police officers or your lowlife pastor"" are lying to him. The teacher says that he received death threats; he admits that the harangue was inappropriate.
With Mr Bolsonaro in the presidency and Mr Vélez at the education ministry, ESP will have more powerful advocates than it could ever have dreamed of. But the movement faces formidable opposition. Courts in at least five states have overturned ESP-backed municipal laws, saying they violate the constitution's guarantee of freedom to learn and teach. If the congress backs the federal proposal, it will surely be challenged in the courts. In the fight to contain a radical president's powers, classrooms will be an early battleground.","Education in Brazil

Brazil 's military rulers exiled him in 1964 . Today , his writings are on the syllabus in most teacher - training courses in Brazil . A law designates him "" the patron of Brazilian education "" . 
 For ESP , Freire transformed "" innocent illiterate people into illiterate communists "" . During the election campaign Jair Bolsonaro vowed to "" take a flame - thrower to the ministry of education and get Paulo Freire out of there "" . 
 The panic is overdone . Freire is a source of "" fashionable jargon "" , not a shaper of policy , says Vitor Henrique Paro , a professor of education at the University of Sāo Paulo . ESP has produced no rigorous studies showing that schools are promoting left - wing ideas and non - traditional lifestyles . "" They 're citing isolated incidents , "" says Mr Paro . Olavo de Carvalho , an influential conservative intellectual and ally of ESP , admitted in a newspaper interview that the proposed federal law to suppress such evils is "" premature "" because there is no evidence that they are widespread . 
 There have been enough incidents to rile ESP , which in turn has sowed panic in schools . Teachers in classrooms have worn т - shirts supporting leftist candidates and described the impeachment in 2016 of President Dilma Rousseff as a "" coup "" , echoing the language of the pt , her party . In a video shared on Jair Bolsonaro's Facebook page , a teacher screams at a student : "" I fought for democracy and you 're here talking about Jair Bolsonaro . "" 
 Equally sinister in ESP 's eyes are campaigns to discourage discrimination against gay people . In 2011 the humanrights committee of the lower house of congress proposed a programme called "" schools without homophobia "" , which would have encouraged discussion of gender stereotypes and the viewing of films such as "" Beautiful Thing "" , about a gay relationship . That angered evangelicals . Ms Rousseff , who was president at the time , blocked the programme . That has not stopped Jair Bolsonaro from accusing the pt of distributing "" gay kits "" , Jair Bolsonaro's name for ma- terials that promote tolerance of gays . 
 A school in Porto Alegre , in the southern state of Rio Grande do Sul , sacked a teacher for assigning material that discussed gay sex . In Rio de Janeiro a private school removed from the syllabus a book about a family escaping from Brazil 's military dictatorship after parents complained that it teaches communism . Juliana Lopes , a high - school teacher in Sāo Paulo , was fired after telling pupils that she would n't vote for Jair Bolsonaro because she thinks Jair Bolsonaro has an authoritarian agenda . The school accused her of discussing politics "" with an explicit partisan bias "" . Ms Lopes says she was encouraging "" critical thinking "" . 
 By suggesting that pupils record their teachers in action , ESP has heightened their fears . "" Teachers do n't have the right to confidentiality , "" says Mr Nagib . Jair Bolsonaro backs the practice . "" Only bad teachers should have to worry , "" Jair Bolsonaro says . 
 Classroom - made recordings appear on social networks and provoke threats . One video showed a teacher telling a student that "" idiotic police officers or your lowlife pastor "" are lying to him . The teacher says that he received death threats ; he admits that the harangue was inappropriate . 
 With Jair Bolsonaro in the presidency and Mr Vélez at the education ministry , ESP will have more powerful advocates than it could ever have dreamed of . But the movement faces formidable opposition . Courts in at least five states have overturned ESP - backed municipal laws , saying they violate the constitution 's guarantee of freedom to learn and teach . If the congress backs the federal proposal , it will surely be challenged in the courts . In the fight to contain a radical president 's powers , classrooms will be an early battleground .",140,Brazil,ctb-140-2,PRE TERM,True,Jair Bolsonaro,22,True

BOA VISTA
Brazilian Indians are learning to live with the state
DRIVE AN HOUR north-west from Boa Vista, capital of Brazil's Roraima state, towards the border with Venezuela, and pastures of grazing cattle and rice fields give way to the stunning but unkempt expanses of the São Marcos indigenous reserve. Here, sleepy roadside villages show little sign of life, aside from omnipresent prayer sheds marked with the green signs of Seventh Day Adventists.
Brazil outlaws large-scale agriculture or mining in areas demarcated for its 1m-odd indigenous citizens. But the dearth of smaller, local businesses irritates some indigenous leaders by helping to perpetuate the stereotype of the ""lazy Indian"". ""We must prove to other Brazilians that we too can produce,"" says Alindo Ferreira, the ambitious chief of Tarau-Paru, a community of 170 souls on the edge of the reserve.
Mr Ferreira, who is in his early 40s, is keen to grow more manioc, bananas and other cash crops, from which the average family in his village earns more than $125 a week. He proudly points to a flour-production shack with a corrugated-iron roof that has replaced a prettier but rain-prone traditional hut nearby. Ancestors would always let the forest retake the land as it pleased. The chief sees nothing wrong with nudging reforestation along by cultivating more profitable native plants.
At a meeting of the Indigenous Council of Roraima in Boa Vista, community leaders broadly agree with this hopeful vision. Yet the discussion soon reverts to a topic of perpetual concern: land. In 2017 two-thirds of areas traditionally occupied by indigenous peoples had been officially recognised. Nearly half of Roraima state has been demarcated as indigenous land. The land remains the property of the federal government, but its native inhabitants are granted the use of it in perpetuity. Opponents of further demarcations argue that the Indians, just 0.4% of the national population of 211m, occupy 14% of the land. Surely, that is enough.
In theory, indigenous rights have long enjoyed strong guarantees. But implementation has been patchy. For much of the 20th century the Brazilian government sought less to protect indigenous people than to bring them into mainstream society. In the 1950s the federal government made a concerted effort to tap Brazil's vast Amazon region for its hydropower, farmland and minerals. Roads and railways brought diseases that killed huge numbers of Amazonian natives. Their numbers fell from several hundred thousand (no one is sure of the population) in 1900 to as few as 70,000 in the 1950s.
Attitudes only began to shift-after Norman Lewis, a British writer, wrote an article in 1969 entitled ""Genocide"". An international outcry led to minor improvements. Then in 1988 a new constitution gave Indians a clutch of rights, including to land, cultural expression and freedom from tutelage. A census in 2010 reckoned that Indian numbers had recovered to 818,000.
Governments now promise schools, clinics and sanitation, as well as new transport links. Many peoples welcome such help. ""No one is against development,"" says Sônia Guajajara of Brazil's Indigenous People Articulation (apib), a lobby group. Nevertheless, she argues that development should be balanced with the sustainable management of resources. In the Amazon indigenous people guard the jungle. Satellite images show that in many countries indigenous lands are less likely to be deforested than similar non-demarcated ones.
Indigenous representatives particularly fear the clout of the farmers' lobby. Across much of central and southern Brazil Indians live in conflict with farmers over land. The lobby's congressional caucus is now said to number 260 deputies and senators, out of a total of 594. They are emboldened by the recent election of Jair Bolsonaro, a right-wing populist, who says he wants an end to further demarcations (but also supposedly to make it easier for tribes to profit from their land). Even before Mr Bolsonaro's election the government had hinted at a desire to approve more mining, drilling and farming projects regardless of their location. The agency for indigenous people had its budget slashed by around 40% in 2017, as part of spending cuts to close a yawning fiscal deficit.
But the apib has become more active in the capital. Three years ago it convinced 48 out of 81 senators to oppose a proposed constitutional amendment that would have transferred oversight of demarcations from the justice ministry to the farmerfriendly legislature. Work has now stalled on a ""super-permissive"" mining code (as Maria Augusta Assirati, a former head of the National Indian Foundation, calls it). In July the government set up a 581,000- hectare protected area where Indian residents will be able to make money by, for instance, offering anglers a chance to hook tucunaré, a prize game fish (see picture).
Indians' attitudes towards the state are evolving, too, as Mr Ferreira demonstrates. To help tackle alcoholism, he has enlisted the help of the army, long accused of disrespect towards Indians. At his request, guards at the neighbouring garrison search tribesmen returning from town and confiscate booze, which he bans in the village. As a result, soldiers and Tarau-Paru rub along well. Children throng the garrison's deputy commander, Lieutenant Bruno Anastácio, on arrival in his armoured car. Asked who they want to be when they grow up, all the boys (and some girls) eagerly volunteer to be soldiers.","Brazil

PAULO GUEDES might not be your first-choice brother-in-law. He is a close adviser to Jair Bolsonaro, Brazil's populist president-elect, who is wistful for military rule. But if you invest in emerging-market government bonds, Mr Guedes is the sort of person you might want as economy minister, the post he will take up on January 1st. He was cofounder of BTG Pactual, Brazil's Goldman Sachs. He has a PhD in economics from the University of Chicago. He favours tax reform and privatisation.
Brazil is not the only focus of attention for such investors. This week Andrés Manuel López Obrador, a left-leaning populist, was sworn in as president of Mexico. He has cancelled a $i3bn bondfinanced airport that is already one-third-built. In November a committee of South Africa's parliament resolved that the constitution should permit land reform without compensation. Some have begun to worry about what Narendra Modi might do to secure re-election as India's prime minister next year.
A host of emerging-market political risks seem suddenly to be salient. These are not amenable to being tallied in a spreadsheet. Nor is the curriculum vitae of the finance minister really much use. For bondholders, the worry is that bad politics will lead ultimately to bad debts. When your upside is capped at getting your money back with interest, you tend to worry more about your downside.
To trade emerging-market bonds you need to know two things, says Jan Dehn, of Ashmore, an investment firm: a country's ability to pay its debts-and its willingness. A spreadsheet is useful when reckoning ability to pay. The debt-to-GDP ratio is a good shorthand. Emerging markets have a lower ratio (the average is 50%) than rich countries (105%), whose bonds are for the most part considered a safe store of value. There is no magic threshold at which default risk becomes acute. But as a practical matter, investors are less jumpy when the debt ratio is stable or falling.
Whether it rises or falls depends on interest rates, GDP growth and the size of the primary budget balance (ie, before interest payments). The more interest rates exceed GDP growth, the bigger the primary surplus must be to stop the debt ratio rising. In this regard, Mexico and Brazil are a study in contrasts. Mexico's debt ratio is near the average and stable. Brazil's, at 84%, is large and rising fast.
When ability to pay is in question, a country's willingness to pay is critical. A government is forced to choose between its debtors and others with a claim on its money, like civil servants and pensioners. A lot depends on the interests of political players. Take Brazil. Mr Guedes's fiscal conservatism may indeed hold sway with his boss. If it does, will Mr Bolsonaro be able to persuade a fractious congress to reform Brazil's pension system, a big cause of its fiscal problems? What can he offer in return? Coming up with answers takes on-the-ground research.
This kind of intelligence-gathering is beyond the scope of the ordinary investor. But mutual funds based on benchmarks, such as J.P. Morgan's emerging-market bond index (EMBI) of hard-currency debt, are broad enough to be considered by the non-specialist. The dozens of countries in the EMBI span a diversity of political risks. And the rewards are handsome. The spread of EMBI bonds over Treasury bonds is around 4.2 percentage points. And because in most emerging markets dollar bonds are not a big part of overall debt, there is little point in selectively defaulting on them.
Crunch points are rare, says Graham Stock of BlueBay Asset Management. Most of the time, things get a little better in some emerging markets, a bit worse in others. Brazil is different, however. If it does not take action quite soon, its debt ratio will spiral upwards.
Though this sort of binary (will-they-won't-they?) political risk is now uncommon in emerging markets, it is increasingly present in the rich world. The euro's viability depends largely on whether Germany and the zone's other high-saving countries can agree to some form of fiscal union with others, notably Italy, whose debts loom larger.
At least, say the specialists, you are paid a premium for bearing political risk in emerging markets. It rankles that America has incurred no penalty for policies-a big unfunded tax cut; protectionism-that would sink a poorer country. That Steven Mnuchin, the treasury secretary, is also an alumnus of Goldman Sachs was no bar to recklessness.

Whether Jair Bolsonaro succeeds in reforming pensions will shape his presidency-and Brazil's future
""We can't save Brazil by killing old W people,"" says Jair Bolsonaro, Brazil's next president. He is referring to the country's main public-policy problem: a bill for pensions that eats up more than half of the federal budget and is growing at a rate four percentage points above inflation. He is not the only person in the incoming administration to have expressed ambivalence and a lack of urgency about reining the spending in. ""We have four years to do it,"" says Onyx Lorenzoni, his chief of staff.
And yet many are betting Mr Bolsonaro will act speedily to solve a problem that has bedevilled Brazil for years. Their optimism stems from his pick for economy minister: Paulo Guedes, who studied at the University of Chicago and co-founded btg Pactual, Brazil's foremost home-grown investment bank. Investors are placing their faith in him to lead the fiscal adjustment of 4-5% of gdp required to stabilise the public debt, and the liberalising reforms needed to rekindle growth after a recession in 2015-16 that wiped 7.3% off gdp.
The outgoing president, Michel Temer, managed some fiscal reforms, notably a cap on federal spending and cuts to subsidised lending. But pensions defeated him, after he looked likely to get caught up in a corruption investigation that had already entangled many lawmakers. This year's election pitted Mr Bolsonaro, a law-and-order candidate only lately converted to economic rectitude, against Fernando Haddad, a left-wing acolyte of Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, a jailed former president. During the rancorous and unpredictable campaign, reforms were put on hold. Investors decided to ""wait the whole thing out"", says Tony Volpon of ubs, a bank. Now they are celebrating, perhaps prematurely. The currency, pummeled in the past two years, staged a rebound (see chart 1).
Since Brazil has healthy foreign-exchange reserves and its lowest inflation rate for decades, progress depends not on global financial markets or institutions, but on politicians in Brasilia. That is both encouraging and worrying. ""To reform the system, you have to be inside it,"" says Ana Carla Abrăo of Oliver Wyman, a consultancy. But insiders have resisted reforming pensions for years.
Their generosity dates from the transition from dictatorship to democracy in the 1980s. The pressure to keep them generous is ""unimaginable"", says Fernando Henrique Cardoso, a former president who tried reform in the 1990s. The system was once even more insanely lavish.
The government scheme for privatesector workers is heavily subsidised. The public-sector scheme is even more bountiful; civil servants not uncommonly retire in their 50s on full pay. Military pensions are particularly outsize-but they are unlikely to be touched. (Mr Bolsonaro, a retired captain, began drawing a pension at 33.) Such privileged groups are sure to resist reform. According to the treasury, 41% of pension benefits go to the richest fifth of Brazilians, and 3% to the poorest.
But an ageing population means the system is unsustainable. There were eight workers for every pensioner in 2000. By 2060 there will be just two, says Paulo Tafner of the Institute for Applied Economic Research, a government-linked think-tank. The government spends 12% of gdp on pensions, compared with an aver- age of 8% in the rich countries of the oecd (see chart 2).
Pensions have played a big part in pushing the public debt-to-GDP ratio from 52% at end of 2013 to 74%. Without reform, it could soon pass 90%. A ten-year freeze on federal spending in 2016 slowed the rise in debt. But as pensions continued to swell, they exacerbated the squeeze on public services and investment in infrastructure.
Many hoped that before taking office Mr Bolsonaro would be able to bounce the outgoing congress into passing a stalled pension reform introduced by Mr Temer. Though that proved hopeless, the new president may still revive it next year. It keeps the ""pay-as-you-go"" system, in which current workers support current pensioners, but phases in a minimum retirement age and minimum contribution period. It would save 400bn reais ($ioobn) over the coming decade. (For comparison, net public debt has risen by 260bn reais since the start of the year.)
Others advocate greater radicalism. During the campaign Mr Guedes proposed a ""capitalisation"" model, with retired people drawing pensions from savings pots built up while in work. Several schemes, all less daring, are under consideration. A notable one would feature pay-as-you-go for most retired people, but with tighter eligibility rules; a guaranteed minimum pension for the poorest; and a capitalisation system for high earners. According to Mr Tafner, one of its authors, it would save i.3trn reais over ten years.
But recently Mr Bolsonaro has talked of ""slicing"" reform into stages, starting by introducing a minimum pensionable age. And congress may dilute any scheme further, as it did with Mr Temer's. Markets will grow impatient if a proposal is not making its way through congress by July, says Arthur Carvalho of Morgan Stanley, a bank. But even the most comprehensive reforms under consideration will not solve all Brazil's fiscal problems. They would take years to have much effect on spending, since current pensioners would continue to benefit from the old system.
Success would, however, increase confidence, lower long-term interest rates and raise hopes for other much-needed reforms. These include privatising inefficient state companies (a one-off deficitslasher), further cutting subsidised lending (which distorts credit markets and monetary policy) and simplifying a regressive tax system that gives 4% of gdp in concessions to businesses. ""It has no rules, only exceptions,"" jokes Bernard Appy of the Centre for Fiscal Citizenship, a think-tank.
The big question is whether Mr Bolsonaro can bring congress into line. His Social Liberal Party has little more than a tenth of the seats, and he says he will not corral lawmakers in the usual Brazilian fashion, namely by buying off parties with pork-barrel spending and appointments to high-spending ministries. He plans instead to negotiate issue by issue with crossparty interest groups, such as evangelicals, security hardliners and farmers. That may not work. ""The caucuses will back him when it comes to their own interests, but when it's time to vote for pensions reform, each congressman thinks of himself,"" says Simone Tebet, a senator from the centrist Brazilian Democratic Movement.
Abolition mission
Mr Bolsonaro was elected on a platform of abolishing privileges, so he must emphasise that message to bring pressure to bear on congress, says Arminio Fraga, a former central-bank director who worked with Mr Tafner on pension reform. But Mr Bolsonaro and Mr Guedes had early warning of how hard their task will be when they failed to dissuade the outgoing congress from increasing public-sector pay by 16%, far above inflation. Meanwhile, an auction for oil-exploration rights hit a snag after Mr Guedes offered to share the revenue with the states, only to back-pedal after realising this would bust the spending cap that was Mr Temer's main achievement. Congress, sensing an opportunity, refused to approve the auction without getting a cut.
The new economic team is committed to reform and conditions are favourable, says Eduardo Guardia, the outgoing finance minister. But, he adds with some understatement, ""There is execution risk."" Others are heartened that, after so long, pension reform leads the next president's agenda. ""Debate about the allocation of government spending has never happened before in Brazil,"" says Mr Carvalho. ""What is a priority? Do you take from teachers, from judges, from farmers or from families?"" The answer-""All of them""-is unpalatable. But it is the one Brazil needs. ?","Brazil 's economy

That is both encouraging and worrying . "" To reform the system , you have to be inside it , "" says Ana Carla Abrăo of Oliver Wyman , a consultancy . But insiders have resisted reforming pensions for years . 
 Their generosity dates from the transition from dictatorship to democracy in the 1980s . The pressure to keep them generous is "" unimaginable "" , says Fernando Henrique Cardoso , a former president who tried reform in the 1990s . The system was once even more insanely lavish . 
 The government scheme for privatesector workers is heavily subsidised . The public - sector scheme is even more bountiful ; civil servants not uncommonly retire in their 50s on full pay . Military pensions are particularly outsize - but they are unlikely to be touched . ( Jair Bolsonaro began drawing a pension at 33 . ) Such privileged groups are sure to resist reform . According to the treasury , 41 % of pension benefits go to the richest fifth of Brazilians , and 3 % to the poorest . 
 But an ageing population means the system is unsustainable . There were eight workers for every pensioner in 2000 . By 2060 there will be just two , says Paulo Tafner of the Institute for Applied Economic Research , a government - linked think - tank . The government spends 12 % of gdp on pensions , compared with an aver- age of 8 % in the rich countries of the oecd ( see chart 2 ) . 
 Pensions have played a big part in pushing the public debt - to - GDP ratio from 52 % at end of 2013 to 74 % . Without reform , it could soon pass 90 % . A ten - year freeze on federal spending in 2016 slowed the rise in debt . But as pensions continued to swell , they exacerbated the squeeze on public services and investment in infrastructure . 
 Many hoped that before taking office Jair Bolsonaro would be able to bounce the outgoing congress into passing a stalled pension reform introduced by Mr Temer . Though that proved hopeless , Jair Bolsonaro may still revive it next year . It keeps the "" pay - as - you - go "" system , in which current workers support current pensioners , but phases in a minimum retirement age and minimum contribution period . It would save 400bn reais ( $ ioobn ) over the coming decade . ( For comparison , net public debt has risen by 260bn reais since the start of the year . ) 
 Others advocate greater radicalism . During the campaign Jair Bolsonaro proposed a "" capitalisation "" model , with retired people drawing pensions from savings pots built up while in work . Several schemes , all less daring , are under consideration . A notable one would feature pay - as - you - go for most retired people , but with tighter eligibility rules ; a guaranteed minimum pension for the poorest ; and a capitalisation system for high earners . According to Mr Tafner , one of its authors , it would save i.3trn reais over ten years . 
 But recently Jair Bolsonaro has talked of "" slicing "" reform into stages , starting by introducing a minimum pensionable age . And congress may dilute any scheme further , as it did with Mr Temer 's . Markets will grow impatient if a proposal is not making its way through congress by July , says Arthur Carvalho of Morgan Stanley , a bank . But even the most comprehensive reforms under consideration will not solve all Brazil 's fiscal problems . They would take years to have much effect on spending , since current pensioners would continue to benefit from the old system . 
 Success would , however , increase confidence , lower long - term interest rates and raise hopes for other much - needed reforms . These include privatising inefficient state companies ( a one - off deficitslasher ) , further cutting subsidised lending ( which distorts credit markets and monetary policy ) and simplifying a regressive tax system that gives 4 % of gdp in concessions to businesses . "" It has no rules , only exceptions , "" jokes Bernard Appy of the Centre for Fiscal Citizenship , a think - tank . 
 The big question is whether Jair Bolsonaro can bring congress into line . Jair Bolsonaro's Social Liberal Party has little more than a tenth of the seats , and Jair Bolsonaro says Jair Bolsonaro will not corral lawmakers in the usual Brazilian fashion , namely by buying off parties with pork - barrel spending and appointments to high - spending ministries . Jair Bolsonaro plans instead to negotiate issue by issue with crossparty interest groups , such as evangelicals , security hardliners and farmers . That may not work . "" The caucuses will back Jair Bolsonaro when it comes to their own interests , but when it 's time to vote for pensions reform , each congressman thinks of himself , "" says Simone Tebet , a senator from the centrist Brazilian Democratic Movement . 
 Abolition mission 
 Jair Bolsonaro was elected on a platform of abolishing privileges , so Jair Bolsonaro must emphasise that message to bring pressure to bear on congress , says Arminio Fraga , a former central - bank director who worked with Mr Tafner on pension reform . But Jair Bolsonaro and Jair Bolsonaro had early warning of how hard their task will be when they failed to dissuade the outgoing congress from increasing public - sector pay by 16 % , far above inflation . Meanwhile , an auction for oil - exploration rights hit a snag after Jair Bolsonaro offered to share the revenue with the states , only to back - pedal after realising this would bust the spending cap that was Mr Temer 's main achievement . Congress , sensing an opportunity , refused to approve the auction without getting a cut . 
 The new economic team is committed to reform and conditions are favourable , says Eduardo Guardia , the outgoing finance minister . But , he adds with some understatement , "" There is execution risk . "" Others are heartened that , after so long , pension reform leads the next president 's agenda . "" Debate about the allocation of government spending has never happened before in Brazil , "" says Mr Carvalho . "" What is a priority ? Do you take from teachers , from judges , from farmers or from families ? "" The answer-""All of them""-is unpalatable . But it is the one Brazil needs . ?",140,Brazil,ctb-140-2,PRE TERM,True,Jair Bolsonaro,26,True

""Fire and Fury""
In another dysfunctional year at the White House, Rex Tillerson was sacked as secretary of state, as was Jeff Sessions as attorney-general, both after the president had publicly undermined them. The investigation by Robert Mueller, the special counsel, into Russian influence in American elections rumbled on, laying charges against some of Mr Trump's former aides. A voter backlash against Mr Trump propelled the Democrats to win the House of Representatives in the mid-terms, though the Republicans increased their majority in the Senate.
The messy spectacle of Brett Kavanaugh's confirmation hearings to the Supreme Court polarised American politics even further. With the #MeToo movement fully behind them, Democrats wheeled out sexualassault allegations from the early 1980s to try to block his path. Mr Kavanaugh survived the media circus and was eventually confirmed in the Senate by 50-48, the narrowest such margin since 1881. He appointed a team of all-female clerks, a first for the court.
Bother Brexit
After a year of tortuous Brexit negotiations, Theresa May and the European Commission agreed a deal for Britain's withdrawal from the European Union, but Britain's Parliament has not approved the agreement. Britain's prime minister clung to power after hard Brexiteers in her party tried to bring her down. Two-and-ahalf years after the referendum, the opposition Labour Party still had no coherent Brexit policy. Britain is due to leave the EU on March 29th.
Tensions increased between Britain and Russia after two Russian intelligence officers poisoned Sergei Skripal, a dissident, and his daughter with a nerve agent in Salisbury, an otherwise quiet cathedral town. They both survived. Russia paraded the attackers on television, claiming they were innocent tourists with an interest in church spires.
Facebook had a terrible year. The social network came under intense pressure to rein in fake news and protect user data. The revelation that Cambridge Analytica, a political consultancy that had worked on Donald Trump's campaign in 2016, had obtained information on 87m Facebook users through a third-party app shook the company to its core.
A large number of prominent chief executives left their jobs or announced their departures. The list includes Vittorio Colao at Vodafone, Indra Nooyi at PepsiCo, Paul Polman at Unilever, Martin Sorrell at wpp and Dieter Zetsche at Daimler. John Flannery was ousted at General Electric, as was John Cryan at Deutsche Bank. Carlos Ghosn was dismissed from Nissan for alleged misdeeds. The carmaking industry lost another giant with the death of Sergio Marchionne, Fiat Chrysler's boss.
Elon Musk stood down as Tesla's chairman, but remains chief executive, after tweeting that he intended to take the company private, a move that fell foul of regulators. The electric-car maker at last hit its production targets, and actually made a quarterly profit.
The world watched and waited as 12 boys and their football coach trapped in a flooded cave in Thailand were rescued in a complex operation involving thousands of people. A navy diver died in the attempt. Mr Musk tweeted unfounded claims that one of the rescuers was a paedophile. The rescuer had provoked Mr Musk by deriding his offer of a kid-sized submarine to help the boys escape as a pr stunt.
Carmakers ramped up their development of electric and self-driving vehicles. A woman was run down in Arizona by one of Uber's autonomous cars, the world's first fatal accident involving a pedestrian and a driverless vehicle.
In Syria the regime of Bashar al-Assad used chemical weapons again, killing scores of people in Douma, the last rebel stronghold in Eastern Ghouta. America responded by firing missiles at military targets. Later in the year a Russian military jet was shot down by Syria. Instead of blaming its ally, Russia said Israel was responsible because it had provided misleading information about a missile attack it had launched.
Xi Jinping confirmed his grip on power in China by promoting more of his allies to senior positions. Wang Qishan, who led a crackdown on corruption, was made vice-president. His new role includes helping to manage ties with America. The priority for the government was limiting the damage from the trade conflict with America; GDP in the third quarter grew at the slowest pace since the financial crisis. China's stockmarkets will finish the year well down.
Donald Trump hailed his summit with Kim Jong Un, North Korea's dictator, as a breakthrough, even going so far as to say ""we fell in love"" during the ongoing detente. But there has been little progress implementing the deal they signed. The North has been sending out mixed signals about whether it intends to denuclearise. The North's pr offensive included sending a team to the Winter Olympics that marched with the South Korean side under a reunification flag.
Mr Trump's attempt to replicate his tough-guy approach with Iran did not produce a similar rapprochement. He pulled out of the deal to roll back Iran's nuclear-weapons programme, describing it as ""rotten"". The reimposition of American sanctions, especially on its oil and gas industry, crippled Iran's economy.
Popular populists
Brazil and Mexico both elected populist leaders. Jair Bolsonaro, a fan of former military regimes, won Brazil's presidency after being stabbed during the campaign and losing 40% of his blood. Mexico elected Andrés Manuel López Obrador, a leftist with a penchant for dodgy referendums. AMLO, as he is called, slashed wages for top officials, including himself, and vowed to halt reforms of education and the oil sector.
In the year's other big elections, Colombia took a conservative turn when it elected Iván Duque as president. With the main opposition candidate barred from running, Vladimir Putin was easily re-elected as Russia's president. Pakistan got a new prime minister in Imran Khan, though the former cricket star had unsporting help from the army. Italy got a new populist coalition, which did little to tackle the country's mounting debt problem.
Malaysians ousted the increasingly corrupt party that had ruled their country since independence in 1957, even though it had tried to rig the ballot. And Zimbabwe's election was won by zanu-pf, sans Robert Mugabe. The opposition claimed the vote had been rigged, but the electoral commission insisted there had been no skulduggery.
Cyril Ramaphosa took over as South Africa's president when Jacob Zuma at last resigned after years of corruption scandals. The moribund economy emerged from recession. Australia also got a new leader when Malcolm Turnbull was ousted as prime minister by his party colleagues and replaced with Scott Morrison. The office has changed hands six times since 2007. Amid an impeachment vote, Pedro Pablo Kuczynski resigned as Peru's president.
The crisis of socialist mismanagement in Venezuela deepened, speeding up a mass exodus of its hungry and disenfranchised people. The military officers in charge of toilet-paper distribution failed to deliver. Inflation hit 1,000,000%. Nicolás Maduro, the president, gained another term in a sham election. He blamed Colombia for what he said was an assassination attempt on himself by drones. The event, captured on tv, showed troops fleeing rather than defending their leader.
I don't believe it
Global warming was said to be partly responsible for wildfires that killed some 100 people near Athens and at least 85 in California. A report by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change warned that such calamities will become more common if the world warms even by another 0.5°C. A White House report forecast grim effects for the American economy: Donald Trump said he didn't believe it. An international deal was struck on how to implement the Paris agreement on climate change.
Indonesia suffered two devastating earthquakes. The first struck the island of Lombok, killing over 560 people. The second triggered a tsunami in Sulawesi, killing more than 2,250 people.
Women got wheels
Saudi Arabia lifted a ban on female drivers. It also allowed cinemas to open for the first time in decades (the first film to be shown publicly was ""Black Panther""). But these small liberalising steps were overshadowed by the arbitrary locking up of feminists, plutocrats and many others.
The kingdom froze its links with Canada after Canada's foreign minister mildly criticised such abuses. Jamal Khashoggi, a journalist, was murdered and dismembered by Saudi operatives in a consulate in Istanbul.
The war in Yemen ground on. An air strike on a school bus that killed scores of children was just one incident in which civilians were caught up. The UN warned that the country was on the brink of a famine, with up to 14m people at risk of starvation.
Gun violence in America hit the headlines again. A former pupil went on a rampage at his high school in Florida on St Valentine's Day, murdering 17 people. Eleven Jews were murdered by a gunman at a synagogue in Pittsburgh, America's worst-ever anti-Semitic attack. Over one weekend in Chicago 75 people were shot in separate incidents, 13 of them fatally.
Trump grump
Jerome Powell continued gradually raising interest rates in his first year as chairman of the Federal Reserve. Mr Trump said he wasn't ""even a little bit happy"" with him. The political pressure Mr Powell endured was nothing compared with Turkey's central bank. Recep Tayyip Erdogan, Turkey's president, described high interest rates as ""the mother of all evil"" and claimed that they cause inflation. Most economists think they curb it. After a run on the lira, the central bank eventually raised rates regardless.
After a run on the peso, Argentina had to call in the IMF (again). Mauricio Macri, the president, introduced an austerity plan and new taxes on exports.
Stockmarkets appeared to be heading for their worst year since the financial crisis. Many leading indices, including the s&p 5oo, the Dow Jones Industrial Average and the ftse ioo are set to end the year below the level at which they started. There was a broad sell-off in technology stocks. Apple, which had earlier become the first company worth $1trn, tumbled. Google was slapped with a record €4.3bn ($5bn) fine by the European Commission. The bitcoin bubble burst.
The consolidation of media and telecommunications companies produced some of the year's blockbuster mergers, including a deal between T-Mobile and Sprint that valued the combined entity at $146bn. Rupert Murdoch's association with Sky, a British subscription-TV broadcaster that Mr Murdoch's company founded in 1989, ended after it was bought by Comcast.
Germany's government lost two state elections in which the far right gained. Angela Merkel, chancellor since 2005 and a stabilising force in Europe, said she would step down in 2021. Germany's consternation was compounded by its football team being knocked out in the early stage of the World Cup for the first time since 1938. France won the tournament.
One of the most bizarre stories of 2018 was the faked assassination of Arkady Babchenko, a Russian journalist and critic of the Kremlin, by Ukraine's intelligence services. Mr Babchenko's body was smeared with pig's blood and taken to a morgue while his ""murder"" was deplored by the world's media. His sudden appearance, alive, at a press conference dumbfounded his grieving friends and colleagues. Wisely, he had kept his wife in the loop, but he still apologised to her publicly.","America and China started a trade war , the world 's worst such dispute in decades .

KATOWICE
A UN climate meeting ends with guarded optimism
HOSTING COP24, the latest of the UN's annual climate summits, in Katowice was meant to symbolise the transition from an old, dirty world to a new, clean one. Spiritually, the city is the home of Poland's coal miners. Today, it is replete with besuited management consultants and bearded baristas. The venue itself was on top of a disused mine in the city centre.
Ahead of the two-week powwow, which concluded on December 15th, many feared the meeting would instead highlight the unresolved contradictions involved in that transition. So it came as a relief when nearly 14,000 delegates from 195 countries managed-more or less, and a day late-to achieve the gathering's main objective: a ""rule book"" for putting into practice the Paris agreement of 2015, which commits the world to keeping global warming ""well below"" 2°C relative to pre-industrial times, and preferably within 1.5°C.
This outcome was far from assured. Setting an abstract goal, as governments had in Paris, is simpler than agreeing on how to go about reaching it. Technicalities-what counts as a reduction in emissions, who monitors countries' progress and so on- can be politically thorny. Poland's rightwing government, which presided over the talks, lacks both friends (alienated by, among other things, its anti-democratic attacks on judicial independence) and green credentials. Observers were braced for a diplomatic debacle.
Implementing the judgment of Paris
The summit got off to an inauspicious start. At the outset Poland's president, Andrzej Duda, declared that his country cannot reasonably be expected to give up its 200 years' worth of coal reserves. In France, his opposite number, Emmanuel Macron, caved in to massive protests and suspended a planned fuel-tax rise intended to help curb greenhouse-gas emissions from transport. Days earlier, Brazil had withdrawn its offer to host next year's summit after Jair Bolsonaro, the presidentelect who takes office in January and who would love to follow his American counterpart, Donald Trump, out of the Paris deal, said his government had no interest.
Despite these early setbacks, negotiators resolved most of 2,800-odd points of contention in the rule book's pre-summit draft. Michal Kurtyka, the amiable Polish bureaucrat who chaired the proceedings, turned apparent haplessness into a virtue, by leaving delegates space to thrash out their differences.
Poor countries won firmer assurances that rich ones would help pay for their efforts to curb their greenhouse-gas emissions and to adapt to rising sea levels and fiercer floods, droughts, storms and other climate-related problems. The rich world, for its part, cajoled China into accepting uniform guidelines for tallying those emissions. Thus stripped of their most powerful voice, other developing countries reluctantly followed suit. If any cannot meet the standards, they must explain why and present a plan to make amends. This concession, long demanded by the Americans, may not persuade Mr Trump to keep the United States in the deal. But it could make things easier for any successor who wished to re-enter it after Mr Trump has left office.
Besides haggling over the rules, a handful of countries-including big polluters such as Ukraine-used the jamboree to announce plans for more ambitious ""nationally determined contributions"" (or ndcs, as the voluntary pledges countries submit under the Paris deal are known). The city councils of Melbourne and Sydney, in Australia, joined a growing number of national and local governments intent on phasing out coal. So did Israel and Senegal. In the wake of Brazil's desertion, Chile stepped in to organise next year's summit, which convention dictates should happen in Latin America. The Paris compact has thus not come apart at the seams.
Predictably, for negotiations that need to balance the interest of nearly 200 parties, no one leaves Katowice entirely happy. Vulnerable countries, such as small island states imperilled by rising seas, worry that the findings of a recent UN-backed scientific report outlining the dire consequences of another half a degree of warming, on top of the 1°C which has happened since the beginning of the Industrial Revolution, have been underplayed. Rich countries grumble that poor ones can still get away with emitting too much carbon dioxide.
Mr Kurtyka was also unable, because of Brazilian objections, to break an impasse on carbon trading. This is an arrangement that allows big belchers of CO2 to offset emissions by paying others to forgo some of theirs. Brazil balked at proposals intended to prevent double-counting in such trading, because it believed they penalised its large stockpile of carbon-trading instruments, such as promises not to chop down patches of the Amazon.

 KATOWICE 
 A UN climate meeting ends with guarded optimism 
 HOSTING COP24 , the latest of the UN 's annual climate summits , in Katowice was meant to symbolise the transition from an old , dirty world to a new , clean one . Spiritually , the city is the home of Poland 's coal miners . Today , it is replete with besuited management consultants and bearded baristas . The venue itself was on top of a disused mine in the city centre . 
 Ahead of the two - week powwow , which concluded on December 15th , many feared the meeting would instead highlight the unresolved contradictions involved in that transition . So it came as a relief when nearly 14,000 delegates from 195 countries managed - more or less , and a day late - to achieve the gathering 's main objective : a "" rule book "" for putting into practice the Paris agreement of 2015 , which commits the world to keeping global warming "" well below "" 2 ° C relative to pre - industrial times , and preferably within 1.5 ° C . 
 This outcome was far from assured . Setting an abstract goal , as governments had in Paris , is simpler than agreeing on how to go about reaching it . Technicalities - what counts as a reduction in emissions , who monitors countries ' progress and so on- can be politically thorny . Poland 's rightwing government , which presided over the talks , lacks both friends ( alienated by , among other things , its anti - democratic attacks on judicial independence ) and green credentials . Observers were braced for a diplomatic debacle . 
 Implementing the judgment of Paris 
 The summit got off to an inauspicious start . At the outset Poland 's president , Andrzej Duda , declared that his country can not reasonably be expected to give up its 200 years ' worth of coal reserves . In France , his opposite number , Emmanuel Macron , caved in to massive protests and suspended a planned fuel - tax rise intended to help curb greenhouse - gas emissions from transport . Days earlier , Brazil had withdrawn its offer to host next year 's summit after Jair Bolsonaro's deal , said Jair Bolsonaro's government had no interest . 
 Despite these early setbacks , negotiators resolved most of 2,800 - odd points of contention in the rule book 's pre - summit draft . Michal Kurtyka , the amiable Polish bureaucrat who chaired the proceedings , turned apparent haplessness into a virtue , by leaving delegates space to thrash out their differences . 
 Poor countries won firmer assurances that rich ones would help pay for their efforts to curb their greenhouse - gas emissions and to adapt to rising sea levels and fiercer floods , droughts , storms and other climate - related problems . The rich world , for its part , cajoled China into accepting uniform guidelines for tallying those emissions . Thus stripped of their most powerful voice , other developing countries reluctantly followed suit . If any can not meet the standards , they must explain why and present a plan to make amends . This concession , long demanded by the Americans , may not persuade Mr Trump to keep the United States in the deal . But it could make things easier for any successor who wished to re - enter it after Mr Trump has left office . 
 Besides haggling over the rules , a handful of countries - including big polluters such as Ukraine - used the jamboree to announce plans for more ambitious "" nationally determined contributions "" ( or ndcs , as the voluntary pledges countries submit under the Paris deal are known ) . The city councils of Melbourne and Sydney , in Australia , joined a growing number of national and local governments intent on phasing out coal . So did Israel and Senegal . In the wake of Brazil 's desertion , Chile stepped in to organise next year 's summit , which convention dictates should happen in Latin America . The Paris compact has thus not come apart at the seams . 
 Predictably , for negotiations that need to balance the interest of nearly 200 parties , no one leaves Katowice entirely happy . Vulnerable countries , such as small island states imperilled by rising seas , worry that the findings of a recent UN - backed scientific report outlining the dire consequences of another half a degree of warming , on top of the 1 ° C which has happened since the beginning of the Industrial Revolution , have been underplayed . Rich countries grumble that poor ones can still get away with emitting too much carbon dioxide . 
 Mr Kurtyka was also unable , because of Brazilian objections , to break an impasse on carbon trading . This is an arrangement that allows big belchers of CO2 to offset emissions by paying others to forgo some of theirs . Brazil balked at proposals intended to prevent double - counting in such trading , because it believed they penalised its large stockpile of carbon - trading instruments , such as promises not to chop down patches of the Amazon . As a result , the issue has been kicked into the long cassava . 
 The direction of travel is , nevertheless , correct . Earlier in the meeting Ottmar Edenhofer , a veteran German climate policymaker who is director of the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research , had feared that Katowice would mark "" the beginning of the end of the Paris agreement "" . For all its shortcomings , the compromise which emerged is not that .

Jair Bolsonaro has a chance to transform his country. He may do it grave harm
""HOPE, FINALLY, defeated fear,"" declared Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva upon becoming Brazil's president 16 years ago. Many Brazilians greeted the election of Lula, a left-wing former tradeunion leader who vowed to uplift the poor, with optimism bordering on ecstasy. The government led by his Workers' Party at first brought prosperity, but its 13 years in power ended in a nightmare of economic depression and corruption. Dilma Rousseff, Lula's chosen successor, was impeached in 2016. Lula himself is serving a 12-year jail sentence for graft.
The fear and rage this caused has ushered into power Jair Bolsonaro, who took office on January 1st. He will be a different sort of president: fiercely socially conservative, a fan of Brazil's military dictatorship of 1964-85, confrontational where most predecessors were conciliatory. And yet Brazilians greet him with something of the hope that welcomed Lula. Three-quarters say they like what they have seen since his election.
On many counts these hopes look misplaced. Mr Bolsonaro had an undistinguished record during seven terms in congress. He often belittles women, has praised the old military regime's torturers and goads the police to kill more criminal suspects. His new ministers for foreign affairs, education, the environment and human rights all look likely to do more harm than good. Yet in some areas, he espouses sensible ideas. In particular, if he means what he says about the economy and can put his policies into practice, he could end up lifting Brazil's fortunes. Brazilians are entitled to hope. A cyclical upturn, which has already begun, will help him (see Americas section).
A former army captain, Mr Bolsonaro is not instinctively an economic liberal. However, he has entrusted economic policy to a genuine believer in free markets. Paulo Guedes, a former banker with a doctorate from the University of Chicago, wants to lighten many of the burdens that have weighed down the economy. Since 1980 GDP growth has averaged just 2.6%, far below that of many other emerging-market economies. Mr Guedes wants to deregulate, simplify the enterprise-crushing tax code, privatise state-owned firms and slash the enormous budget deficit, which was an estimated 7% of GDP last year.
He recognises that the most important reform is to slash pension costs which, at 12% of GDP, are roughly the same size in Brazil as they are in richer, older countries and on course to become staggeringly larger. The changes will be painful. They include raising the effective retirement age (Mr Bolsonaro began collect- ing a military pension when he was 33) and changing the rule for adjusting the minimum wage, to which pensions are linked. Without this, the government has little hope of containing its growing public debt or complying with a constitutional amendment that freezes spending in real terms. An ambitious reform, by contrast, could keep inflation and interest rates low, hastening Brazil's recovery and accelerating long-term growth.
Moro's move
Mr Bolsonaro's other opportunity is to lock in gains Brazil has made in fighting corruption. The scandals that so enraged voters were brought to light mainly by police, prosecutors and judges, especially those in charge of the Lava Jato (Car Wash) investigations of the past four years. Mr Bolsonaro appointed the most prominent corruption-fighting judge, Sérgio Moro, to lead an expanded justice ministry, which will fight crime of all sorts. Mr Moro was the first judge to find Lula guilty. In joining the Bolsonaro team, he opened himself to the charge that he had a political agenda all along. His answer is that the fight against crime and corruption needs better laws alongside the energised judiciary. The new justice minister must now prove that he means it.
If Mr Bolsonaro succeeds in reforming the economy and cleaning up Brazil, he could unleash his country's long-squandered potential. Nothing would give The Economist more pleasure. But to do so he must end his career as a provocateur and become a statesman. He must give up having only a selective respect for the law. And he must stop being lukewarm on pension reform, his government's most important policy, and give it his full-throated support. Mr Bolsonaro has yet to show that he can tell voters bad news-such as that their pensions are unaffordable-or that he can work with congress. Unless he learns quickly, Brazilians will be disappointed again.","Jair Bolsonaro has a chance to transform Jair Bolsonaro's country . Jair Bolsonaro may do it grave harm

Voters hope that Jair Bolsonaro will be a transformational president
""THE CAPTAIN has arrived,"" chanted T thousands of Brazilians on January 1st as Jair Bolsonaro ascended the white marble ramp that leads to the Planalto, the presidential palace in Brasilia. Freshly inaugurated, the country's 38th president looked out over the crowd of flag-waving supporters, soldiers on horseback and besuited statesmen and spoke with the fiery tone that characterised his unlikely ascent. He vowed to rid Brazil of socialism, political correctness and ""ideology that defends bandits"". Unfurling a flag, he declared that it would ""never be red, unless our blood is needed to keep it yellow and green"". ""Mito"" (""Legend""), the crowd chanted.
No past president has revelled as Mr Bolsonaro has in the enemies he has made and the offence he has caused. The former army captain praises Brazil's old military dictatorship and has insulted gay people, blacks and women. Until recently, his detractors were almost as numerous as his adorers. And yet Brazilians are strikingly optimistic as he takes office. Three-quarters say the incoming government is on the right course, according to Ibope, a pollster. Although the economy is recovering slowly from its worst-ever recession in 2014-16, a poll by Datafolha found that the share of Brazilians who are optimistic about the economy has jumped from 23% in August last year to 65% in December.
That is because they see Mr Bolsonaro, who in seven terms as a gadfly in congress never advanced beyond its ""lower clergy"", as a potentially transformational leader. They look to him to overcome corruption, crime and economic disappointment. In fashioning his government since he won the presidential election on October 28th Mr Bolsonaro has shown some signs that he intends to fulfil that expectation. Some of his plans could change Brazil for the better; others could cause immense damage. The main uncertainties are what the balance will be between the good and the bad, and whether he has the skills and the strength to enact his agenda.
Unlike his predecessors, Mr Bolsonaro has not given ministerial jobs to political grandees in order to win their support for his programme. That delights Brazilians, who voted for Mr Bolsonaro largely because they are disgusted with conventional politicians. Instead, he has assembled a cabinet composed of technocrats, ideologues and military men. Much will depend on how they interact with each other, and with congress. That is hard to predict.
The case for optimism rests mainly on two ""superministers"". Paulo Guedes, a former banker with an economics degree from the University of Chicago, will be the economy tsar, leading a ministry that will absorb the ministries of finance, planning and industry. Mr Guedes's support for deregulation, privatisation and, above all, reform of Brazil's unaffordable pension system could provide a tonic that the economy has long needed.
The new justice minister, Sérgio Moro, is supposed to deal with the two other maladies Mr Bolsonaro has identified: corruption and crime. As the judge leading the Lava Jato (Car Wash) investigations into political corruption over the past four years, Mr Moro became a popular hero. He was responsible for the jailing of Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, a former president from the leftwing Workers' Party, who has come to represent everything Mr Bolsonaro and his supporters despise. Lula's allies say that Mr Moro's shift from the courtroom to Mr Bolsonaro's cabinet confirms their suspicions that Lava Jato is a politically motivated witch hunt. But most Brazilians cheered: they expect Mr Moro to take the fight against graft to the heart of government.
He will also be in charge of some of the more brutish policies the president has ad- vocated, including gutting Brazil's guncontrol law, making it easier for ordinary citizens to bear arms.
Mr Bolsonaro has stocked his administration with former generals. These include the vice-president, Hamilton Mourāo, and the national security adviser, Augusto Heleno. Mr Bolsonaro's critics feared that he would militarise politics (Mr Mourāo has come close to justifying intervention by the army to keep order in Brazil). But the generals strive to seem pragmatic and democratic. ""You can erase from the map any kind of [undemocratic] action by Bolsonaro,"" Mr Mourāo said in an interview with The Economist.
The outlook of the government's ideologues may be closest to that of Mr Bolsonaro. They include his three sons, the most influential of whom is Eduardo, a congressman from Sāo Paulo who has courted the Trump administration (he met Donald Trump's son-in-law, Jared Kushner, at the White House in November). He reportedly urged his father to name as foreign minister Ernesto Araújo, a hitherto-obscure diplomat who regards action against climate change as a globalist plot and advocates a Christian alliance among Brazil, the United States and Russia.
His soulmates include the education minister, Ricardo Vélez Rodríguez, who wants to fight the supposed influence in schools of left-wingers and gay-rights advocates. Ricardo Salles, the environment minister, calls climate change a ""secondary issue"" and opposes many of the penalties levied for environmental damage.
Wonks and ideologues
With incompatible points of view, Mr Bolsonaro's team of rivals have already begun to argue with one another. Whereas the president is keen to move Brazil's embassy in Israel from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem (as Mr Trump has done), the agriculture minister, Tereza Cristina, worries that Muslim countries will punish Brazil by buying less of its beef.
Mr Bolsonaro and the foreign minister are suspicious of China-he has accused the country of wanting to ""buy Brazil"". But Mr Mourāo wants a good relationship with China, Brazil's biggest trading partner. Fernando Henrique Cardoso, a former Brazilian president, thinks the pragmatists will prevail in such disputes. ""Money talks,"" he says. But if Mr Araújo's neo-crusading policies win out, ""we'll have to pray.""
The odds may be worse for Mr Guedes's reform plans. In part, that is because Mr Bolsonaro seems ambivalent about them. In the past he has shown no appetite for telling voters that their benefits might be cut. For example, he said that a proposal by the outgoing president, Michel Temer, to set minimum pension ages of 65 for men and 62 for women was too harsh. (Currently, both men and women retire on average in their mid-fifties.) A timid reform would not stabilise public debt, which at 77% of GDP is already too high, and prevent pensions from crowding out more productive spending by government.
Getting Mr Bolsonaro's agenda through congress, where his Social Liberal Party holds less than a tenth of the seats, may be harder than overcoming the government's internal divisions. That is especially true of pension reforms, which require constitutional amendments. Mr Bolsonaro has made that job more difficult by handling congress differently from the way his predecessors did. Unwilling to engage in the grubby exchange of pork and patronage for political support, he has tried to marginalise political parties and their leaders. He prefers dealing with congressional caucuses, such as those representing the so-called bullet, beef and Bible (gun, ranching and religion) interests. He hopes to assemble case-by-case coalitions in congress to pass laws. Congressmen will bow to popular pressure, he believes. ""Once we have the support of the public, congress will follow,"" says Mr Mourāo.
But there is little popular enthusiasm for reforms. Unlike the political parties, the caucuses on which Mr Bolsonaro is counting for legislative support have no money and do not whip congressmen in legislative votes. Ricardo Sennes, a political analyst, thinks the odds of passing a pension reform are just 50%. The recent strength of Brazilian financial markets reflects local optimism about economic reform; foreign investors have been wary.
Perhaps realising that governing will be harder than he thought, Mr Bolsonaro has lately opened channels with congress's leaders. In an inauguration-day speech to congress, more measured in tone than his Planalto stemwinder, he called for a ""national pact"" between society and the three branches of government to restore growth and family values and to fight crime and corruption. He has wisely said he will not take sides when the lower house and senate choose their presidents; they play a crucial role in negotiating between parties and the presidency. Parties have been ""demonised"" because of corruption, says Marta Suplicy, a senator from the centrist Brazilian Democratic Movement whose term ended in December, ""but that doesn't mean they should be marginalised"".
Mr Bolsonaro's hopes of being a transformational president depend on his ability to couple pragmatism and economic reform. As important will be fighting corruption and crime in ways that reinforce the rule of law rather than undermining it. Achieving those changes will require wisdom and a talent for political management. Little in Mr Bolsonaro's past suggests that he possesses either quality.","Brazil 
 Voters hope that Jair Bolsonaro will be a transformational president 
 "" Jair Bolsonaro has arrived , "" chanted T thousands of Brazilians on January 1st as Jair Bolsonaro ascended the white marble ramp that leads to the Planalto , the presidential palace in Brasilia . Freshly inaugurated , Jair Bolsonaro's looked out over the crowd of flag - waving supporters , soldiers on horseback and besuited statesmen and spoke with the fiery tone that characterised Jair Bolsonaro's unlikely ascent . Jair Bolsonaro vowed to rid Brazil of socialism , political correctness and "" ideology that defends bandits "" . Unfurling a flag , Jair Bolsonaro declared that it would "" never be red , unless our blood is needed to keep it yellow and green "" . "" Mito "" ( "" Legend "" ) , the crowd chanted . 
 No past president has revelled as Jair Bolsonaro has in the enemies Jair Bolsonaro has made and the offence Jair Bolsonaro has caused . Jair Bolsonaro praises Brazil 's old military dictatorship and has insulted gay people , blacks and women . Until recently , Jair Bolsonaro's detractors were almost as numerous as Jair Bolsonaro's adorers . And yet Brazilians are strikingly optimistic as Jair Bolsonaro takes office . Three - quarters say the incoming government is on the right course , according to Ibope , a pollster . Although the economy is recovering slowly from its worst - ever recession in 2014 - 16 , a poll by Datafolha found that the share of Brazilians who are optimistic about the economy has jumped from 23 % in August last year to 65 % in December . 
 That is because they see Jair Bolsonaro's , as a potentially transformational leader . They look to Jair Bolsonaro to overcome corruption , crime and economic disappointment . In fashioning Jair Bolsonaro's government since Jair Bolsonaro won the presidential election on October 28th Jair Bolsonaro has shown some signs that Jair Bolsonaro intends to fulfil that expectation . Some of Jair Bolsonaro's plans could change Brazil for the better ; others could cause immense damage . The main uncertainties are what the balance will be between the good and the bad , and whether Jair Bolsonaro has the skills and the strength to enact Jair Bolsonaro's agenda . 
 Unlike Jair Bolsonaro's predecessors , Jair Bolsonaro has not given ministerial jobs to political grandees in order to win their support for Jair Bolsonaro's programme . That delights Brazilians , who voted for Jair Bolsonaro largely because they are disgusted with conventional politicians . Instead , Jair Bolsonaro has assembled a cabinet composed of technocrats , ideologues and military men . Much will depend on how they interact with each other , and with congress . That is hard to predict . 
 The case for optimism rests mainly on two "" superministers "" . Paulo Guedes , a former banker with an economics degree from the University of Chicago , will be the economy tsar , leading a ministry that will absorb the ministries of finance , planning and industry . Mr Guedes 's support for deregulation , privatisation and , above all , reform of Brazil 's unaffordable pension system could provide a tonic that the economy has long needed . 
 The new justice minister , Sérgio Moro , is supposed to deal with the two other maladies Jair Bolsonaro has identified : corruption and crime . As the judge leading the Lava Jato ( Car Wash ) investigations into political corruption over the past four years , Mr Moro became a popular hero . He was responsible for the jailing of Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva , a former president from the leftwing Workers ' Party , who has come to represent everything Jair Bolsonaro and Jair Bolsonaro's supporters despise . Lula 's allies say that Mr Moro 's shift from the courtroom to Jair Bolsonaro's cabinet confirms their suspicions that Lava Jato is a politically motivated witch hunt . But most Brazilians cheered : they expect Mr Moro to take the fight against graft to the heart of government . 
 He will also be in charge of some of the more brutish policies Jair Bolsonaro has ad- vocated , including gutting Brazil 's guncontrol law , making it easier for ordinary citizens to bear arms . 
 Jair Bolsonaro has stocked Jair Bolsonaro's administration with former generals . These include the vice - president , Hamilton Mourāo , and the national security adviser , Augusto Heleno . Jair Bolsonaro's critics feared that Jair Bolsonaro would militarise politics ( Mr Mourāo has come close to justifying intervention by the army to keep order in Brazil ) . But the generals strive to seem pragmatic and democratic . "" You can erase from the map any kind of [ undemocratic ] action by Jair Bolsonaro , "" Mr Mourāo said in an interview with The Economist . 
 The outlook of the government 's ideologues may be closest to that of Jair Bolsonaro . They include Jair Bolsonaro's three sons , the most influential of whom is Eduardo , a congressman from Sāo Paulo who has courted the Trump administration ( he met Donald Trump 's son - in - law , Jared Kushner , at the White House in November ) . He reportedly urged his father to name as foreign minister Ernesto Araújo , a hitherto - obscure diplomat who regards action against climate change as a globalist plot and advocates a Christian alliance among Brazil , the United States and Russia . 
 His soulmates include the education minister , Ricardo Vélez Rodríguez , who wants to fight the supposed influence in schools of left - wingers and gay - rights advocates . Ricardo Salles , the environment minister , calls climate change a "" secondary issue "" and opposes many of the penalties levied for environmental damage . 
 Wonks and ideologues 
 With incompatible points of view , Jair Bolsonaro's team of rivals have already begun to argue with one another . Whereas Jair Bolsonaro is keen to move Brazil 's embassy in Israel from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem ( as Mr Trump has done ) , the agriculture minister , Tereza Cristina , worries that Muslim countries will punish Brazil by buying less of its beef . 
 Jair Bolsonaro and the foreign minister are suspicious of China - Jair Bolsonaro has accused the country of wanting to "" buy Brazil "" . But Mr Mourāo wants a good relationship with China , Brazil 's biggest trading partner . Fernando Henrique Cardoso , a former Brazilian president , thinks the pragmatists will prevail in such disputes . "" Money talks , "" he says . But if Mr Araújo 's neo - crusading policies win out , "" we 'll have to pray . "" 
 The odds may be worse for Mr Guedes 's reform plans . In part , that is because Jair Bolsonaro seems ambivalent about them . In the past Jair Bolsonaro has shown no appetite for telling voters that their benefits might be cut . For example , Jair Bolsonaro said that a proposal by the outgoing president , Michel Temer , to set minimum pension ages of 65 for men and 62 for women was too harsh . ( Currently , both men and women retire on average in their mid - fifties . ) A timid reform would not stabilise public debt , which at 77 % of GDP is already too high , and prevent pensions from crowding out more productive spending by government . 
 Getting Jair Bolsonaro's agenda through congress , where Jair Bolsonaro's Social Liberal Party holds less than a tenth of the seats , may be harder than overcoming the government 's internal divisions . That is especially true of pension reforms , which require constitutional amendments . Jair Bolsonaro has made that job more difficult by handling congress differently from the way Jair Bolsonaro's predecessors did . Unwilling to engage in the grubby exchange of pork and patronage for political support , Jair Bolsonaro has tried to marginalise political parties and their leaders . Jair Bolsonaro prefers dealing with congressional caucuses , such as those representing the so - called bullet , beef and Bible ( gun , ranching and religion ) interests . Jair Bolsonaro hopes to assemble case - by - case coalitions in congress to pass laws . Congressmen will bow to popular pressure , Jair Bolsonaro believes . "" Once we have the support of the public , congress will follow , "" says Mr Mourāo . 
 But there is little popular enthusiasm for reforms . Unlike the political parties , the caucuses on which Jair Bolsonaro is counting for legislative support have no money and do not whip congressmen in legislative votes . Ricardo Sennes , a political analyst , thinks the odds of passing a pension reform are just 50 % . The recent strength of Brazilian financial markets reflects local optimism about economic reform ; foreign investors have been wary . 
 Perhaps realising that governing will be harder than Jair Bolsonaro thought , Jair Bolsonaro has lately opened channels with congress 's leaders . In an inauguration - day speech to congress , more measured in tone than Jair Bolsonaro's Planalto stemwinder , Jair Bolsonaro called for a "" national pact "" between society and the three branches of government to restore growth and family values and to fight crime and corruption . Jair Bolsonaro has wisely said Jair Bolsonaro will not take sides when the lower house and senate choose their presidents ; they play a crucial role in negotiating between parties and the presidency . Parties have been "" demonised "" because of corruption , says Marta Suplicy , a senator from the centrist Brazilian Democratic Movement whose term ended in December , "" but that does n't mean they should be marginalised "" . 
 Jair Bolsonaro's hopes of being a transformational president depend on Jair Bolsonaro's ability to couple pragmatism and economic reform . As important will be fighting corruption and crime in ways that reinforce the rule of law rather than undermining it . Achieving those changes will require wisdom and a talent for political management .

""In brazil past glory is more freI I associated with diplomacy than with military feats,"" notes Rubens Ricupero, a former minister, in his monumental history of his country's dealings with the world. This legacy is above all the achievement of the Baron of Rio Branco, the foreign minister from 1902 to 1912, who through peaceful negotiation settled the country's borders with all ten of its neighbours (in some cases expanding its territory).
The values Rio Branco espoused- peace, moderation, trust in international law, non-intervention and what would now be called the pursuit of soft power- became integral to Brazil's idea of itself, Mr Ricupero argues. And Itamaraty, as the foreign ministry is known (from the palace in Rio de Janeiro it formerly occupied), came to be seen as the Rolls-Royce of Brazilian government, its prestige based on meritocracy and knowledge.
So the appointment of Ernesto Araújo as foreign minister in the new government of Jair Bolsonaro has come as a shock to the Brazilian intelligentsia. Mr Araújo is a career diplomat, but a fairly junior one. Aged 51, he only recently achieved ambassadorial rank. His mission, he said, is ""to liberate Brazilian foreign policy"" and Itamaraty ""through truth"". But this truth ""cannot be taught by analytical deduction"", he added. Rather, it is religious in nature. ""God is back and the nation is back,"" he has written.
Mr Araújo's foreign policy will confront what he denounces as ""globalism"", a sneering term for openness to the world. Diplomats should read the New York Times less and Brazilian authors more, he said.
Mr Bolsonaro wants to pull Brazil out of the Paris climate accord. His government has aligned itself with populistnationalists in other countries-above all Donald Trump, but also the leaders of Italy, Hungary and Poland. Mr Bolsonaro has seemed to entertain the idea of inviting the United States to set up a military base. Like Mr Trump, he has declared himself a foe of China. He visited Taiwan during last year's election campaign.
Certainly, Itamaraty has sometimes combined sophistication with do-nothing complacency. And in their critique of foreign policy under governments led by the Workers' Party (pt) from 2003 to 2016, Mr Bolsonaro's people have a point. The pt abandoned some of Rio Branco's values. Its priority of ""south-south"" links was often a veil for anti-Americanism. It failed to stand up for democracy in Latin America, preferring to ally itself with left-wing dictatorships in Venezuela and Cuba.
But Mr Araújo risks making the same mistake-of basing policy on ephemeral ideological affinity, rather than on underlying national interest. His assault on ""globalism"" also exposes a contradiction at the heart of Mr Bolsonaro's project. The new president's powerful economy minister, Paulo Guedes, promises liberal reforms, including privatisation and opening Brazil to trade and competition. The best way to do that is not to ally itself slavishly with the protectionist-in-chief in the White House. Mr Bolsonaro's stance on climate change has already dented the chances of the European Union concluding a long-delayed trade agreement with Mercosur (to which Brazil belongs).
Mr Bolsonaro heads a ramshackle alliance of populist-nationalists (notably two of his sons), religious zealots, business lobbies and the security forces. Mr Araújo owes his job to the first two groups. The armed forces-represented by seven retired generals in the cabinet- espouse a different kind of nationalism, grounded in hard-headed geopolitics. They are interested in co-operation with the United States against organised crime, but will resist automatic alignment with Mr Trump. Then there is Mr Guedes, who has seized control of trade policy from Itamaraty. The economic team has no interest in quarrelling either with China, a big investor with which Brazil has a trade surplus, or with Arab countries (by moving Brazil's embassy in Israel to Jerusalem, as Mr Bolsonaro has promised).
Faced with these more organised rivals, some think Mr Araújo may not last long. Yet even if he does not, he has made his mark. For the first time since the early 1970s during the cold war, Brazilians have been offered an extreme right-wing foreign policy, notes Matias Spektor, an international-relations specialist at Fundaçao Getulio Vargas, a university. Even if modulated, bits of it are likely to be applied by Mr Bolsonaro. It is a long way from Rio Branco, and is unlikely to do much for Brazil's soft power.","The contradictions of Brazil 's new foreign policy

FORTALEZA
Adolescents are caught between drug gangs and police. Jair Bolsonaro wants to add more guns to the mix
The community centre on the outskirts of Fortaleza, the capital of the northeastern state of Ceará, normally hosts throngs of teenagers, who paint and rehearse plays in its tiny theatre. It has been shut on the orders of drug traffickers, who since early January have been setting fire to buses and businesses to protest against new measures to suppress gangs in prisons. Brazilian teenagers are caught in the middle. Gangs pay them 1,000 reais ($265) to carry out attacks. Police have arrested hundreds of suspects, a third of them minors, and killed at least six people. ""You can't be neutral in the war,"" says Carlos (not his real name), 18, his voice breaking with emotion. ""If you're sitting on the fence, you get shot by both sides.""
Even in calmer times, violence hits young people hard. Murder is the leading cause of death for Brazilian teenagers. In Ceará killings of adolescents increased from 191in 2000 to 1,156 in 2017. By one reckoning in Fortaleza in 2014, 11 out of every 1,000 adolescents could expect to be murdered by the age of 19.
The new populist president, Jair Bolsonaro, says Brazil is at war. During the election campaign last year, he promised to give police carte blanche to shoot suspected criminals and to pass laws to send adolescents to adult prisons, which are already packed. He has spoken of building more jails, but probably lacks the money.
On January 15th he signed a decree that makes it easier for ""good citizens"" to buy guns. It ends the discretionary role of the police in granting licences. People will be able to buy guns freely if they meet conditions such as living in a place where the homicide rate exceeds ten per 100,000 people (most Brazilians do). As before, gun owners must have a job and no criminal record. They have to pass a psychological test and get training. It will remain illegal for most Brazilians to carry arms outside their homes or workplaces.
Evaldo Carvalho, who owns a gun shop four blocks from the beach in Fortaleza, thinks Mr Bolsonaro's decree is ""timid"" but a step in the right direction. In his view, crime rose as a result of a gun-control law in 2003. ""Criminals are more audacious when they know citizens can't defend themselves,"" he says. ""More guns equal less crime. Criminals only respect people they are afraid of."" He stands to profit, too, having doubled the number of shooting classes in the week after the president's decree.
Yet some of Mr Bolsonaro's supporters are worried. Violence is ""going to explode"", warns Plauto de Lima, a former director of state prisons in Ceará, who managed the successful election campaign of a pro-Bolsonaro senator. He thinks the state should invest more in crime prevention. ""We always prepare for battle, but not for the post-war,"" he says.
In fact, criminologists and politicians in Ceará have been considering new ways of reducing violence through a mixture of social programmes and data-based policing that proved successful elsewhere. But such ideas are out of sync with Mr Bolsonaro's belief in the iron fist.
The causes of violence in the north-east are complex. The region has a history of settling disputes with pistols or machetes, notes César Barreira, an expert in violence at the Federal University of Ceará. The area lies on the route from drug-producing countries like Colombia to markets in Europe. Many young men migrated from rural areas to cities in recent decades just as that trade expanded. The breakdown in 2016 of a two-decade-old pact between two crime groups, the First Command of the Capital, based in Sāo Paulo, and Red Command, from Rio de Janeiro, led to a fight for control of the slums in Ceará.
The state's centre-left governments assumed, wrongly, that simply reducing poverty and improving education would lead to less crime. The Workers' Party, which governed Brazil from 2003 to 2016, made the same assumption. ""Public security was the great omission,"" says Renato Roseno, a state congressman from the left-wing Socialism and Liberty party.
Then, as governments came under pressure to respond directly to rising crime, they did so ineptly. Brazil's prison population has quadrupled to 800,000 since 2000. Prisons, designed to hold half that number, have become training grounds for gangs; the mayhem in Ceará is being directed by bosses in jail.
In 2015 Mr Roseno set up a committee that interviewed 263 families whose children were murdered and 121 adolescents who were accused of homicide. It found that more than 60% of victims had dropped out of school. Almost all were slain with guns. Most said they had experienced police violence at least once. Killings of adolescents were geographically concentrated: 44% occurred in 17 of Fortaleza's 119 neighbourhoods.
His committee recommended action to usher dropouts back into school, tighter gun controls and human-rights training for police. This, together with data-based policing in high-crime areas, might have set an example for other states and for federal policy, Mr Roseno reckons.
Under Mr Bolsonaro, though, Ceará will have more guns, not fewer. Even before his decree, the police could not keep track of the country's arsenal of legal firearms, points out José Vicente da Silva Filho, who was Brazil's secretary of public security in 2002. Guns have been easy to obtain. Criminals in Fortaleza used to rent them by the hour. Rental services no longer exist because guns can be bought cheaply and easily, even at street markets.
The vast majority of guns used in crime were sold legally to citizens or police, and then lost or stolen. ""The gun bought by the good citizen and the gun used by the criminal are the same gun,"" notes Ivan Marques, the director of Instituto Sou da Paz, an ngo. That does not mean that the gun-control law was pointless. Without it, Brazil's murder rate would have risen much more rapidly than it did, according to a study by the Institute for Applied Economic Research, a government think-tank (see chart).
At the community centre in Fortaleza, Carlos scoffs at the idea that criminals will be deterred by a more heavily armed population. Instead, criminals will attack citizens to steal their guns. ""The criminal might die, but the good citizen will die as well. A lot of people are going to die,"" he predicts. Carlos is anxious. He and three community activists discuss how he might stay alive. He could attend university in a different city. Or he could join the army. Otherwise, he will have to return to the drug gang to which he briefly belonged. Friends in the same homicide-prevention programme have been murdered one by one, mostly by gangs trying to muscle in on his neighbourhood. ""We were ten,"" he says, ""and now we are three."" ?","Murder in Brazil 
 FORTALEZA 
 Adolescents are caught between drug gangs and police . Jair Bolsonaro wants to add more guns to the mix 
 The community centre on the outskirts of Fortaleza , the capital of the northeastern state of Ceará , normally hosts throngs of teenagers , who paint and rehearse plays in its tiny theatre . It has been shut on the orders of drug traffickers , who since early January have been setting fire to buses and businesses to protest against new measures to suppress gangs in prisons . Brazilian teenagers are caught in the middle . Gangs pay them 1,000 reais ( $ 265 ) to carry out attacks . Police have arrested hundreds of suspects , a third of them minors , and killed at least six people . "" You ca n't be neutral in the war , "" says Carlos ( not his real name ) , 18 , his voice breaking with emotion . "" If you 're sitting on the fence , you get shot by both sides . "" 
 Even in calmer times , violence hits young people hard . Murder is the leading cause of death for Brazilian teenagers . In Ceará killings of adolescents increased from 191 in 2000 to 1,156 in 2017 . By one reckoning in Fortaleza in 2014 , 11 out of every 1,000 adolescents could expect to be murdered by the age of 19 . 
 Jair Bolsonaro , says Brazil is at war . During the election campaign last year , Jair Bolsonaro promised to give police carte blanche to shoot suspected criminals and to pass laws to send adolescents to adult prisons , which are already packed . Jair Bolsonaro has spoken of building more jails , but probably lacks the money . 
 On January 15th Jair Bolsonaro signed a decree that makes it easier for "" good citizens "" to buy guns . It ends the discretionary role of the police in granting licences . People will be able to buy guns freely if they meet conditions such as living in a place where the homicide rate exceeds ten per 100,000 people ( most Brazilians do ) . As before , gun owners must have a job and no criminal record . They have to pass a psychological test and get training . It will remain illegal for most Brazilians to carry arms outside their homes or workplaces . 
 Evaldo Carvalho , who owns a gun shop four blocks from the beach in Fortaleza , thinks Jair Bolsonaro's decree is "" timid "" but a step in the right direction . In his view , crime rose as a result of a gun - control law in 2003 . "" Criminals are more audacious when they know citizens ca n't defend themselves , "" he says . "" More guns equal less crime . Criminals only respect people they are afraid of . "" He stands to profit , too , having doubled the number of shooting classes in the week after Jair Bolsonaro's decree . 
 Yet some of Jair Bolsonaro's supporters are worried . Violence is "" going to explode "" , warns Plauto de Lima , a former director of state prisons in Ceará , who managed the successful election campaign of a Jair Bolsonaro Bolsonaro senator . He thinks the state should invest more in crime prevention . "" We always prepare for battle , but not for the post - war , "" he says . 
 In fact , criminologists and politicians in Ceará have been considering new ways of reducing violence through a mixture of social programmes and data - based policing that proved successful elsewhere . But such ideas are out of sync with Jair Bolsonaro's belief in the iron fist .

SAO PAULO
The government's special treatment of mining comes at a cost
WHEN HE SAW the river of sludge roaring down the valley, José Ferreira da Silva did not fear for his son, a welder. He was working for Vale, a Brazilian mining giant, near a tailings dam at its iron-ore mine at Brumadinho. ""The company always said it was safe, and we believed them,"" he says. The dam's collapse on January 25th, unleashing 12m cubic metres of mining waste, is Brazil's worst industrial accident. As the sludge hardened and the death toll rose-the final tally may surpass 350 people-Mr Ferreira's hopes for his missing son faded, but not his anger.
Brazil is going through a grim reckoning. Miners and the government have long enjoyed cosy ties but many wonder: at what cost? Mining accounts for around 5% of GDP, according to Vale. It also employs hundreds of thousands of people and is backed by powerful politicians. That includes the new president, Jair Bolsonaro, who campaigned on promises to open up more of the Amazon forest for prospecting. The latest tragedy comes only three years after a similar collapse of a dam jointly owned by Vale at Mariana, 100 miles (160km) away, where 19 people died.
Tailings dams are cheap and risky. The upstream sort have been banned in Chile and are rare in America and Europe. Their widespread use in Brazil is one way the government helps mining firms to put profit over protection, says Carlos Martinez at the Federal University of Itajubá. Miners are favoured because they often shoulder the responsibilities of governments in remote places, building schools and hospitals, for example. In Minas Gerais (literally, ""General Mines""), the state where Brumadinho is located, Vale often dominates local economies. Once state-owned, but privatised in 1997, it is the biggest employer of Brumadinho's 40,000 residents, and pays 60% of the town's taxes.
Regulatory capture is one result, says Bruno Milanez at the Federal University of Juiz da Fora. Understaffed and underfunded, the National Mining Agency visited only a quarter of Brazil's 790 tailings dams in 2017, leaving mining firms to hire contractors to carry out safety inspections.
Mr Bolsonaro's government now promises a crackdown. Courts have frozen i0bn reais ($2.7bn) of Vale's assets to pay for damages. The firm's shares have plunged (see Schumpeter). Police arrested three employees and two contractors responsible for recent safety studies. The cabinet met to discuss the fate of the remaining high-risk dams. Yet the public outcry after the Mariana disaster led to similar lawsuits and promises. Several mining executives say that stricter oversight must be accompanied by cultural change in the industry to protect human life.
""It's not about whether or not to mine,"" says Maria Dalce Ricas of the Minas Gerais Association for the Defence of the Environment. ""It's how to mine, and where."" A worker's cafeteria should not, for instance, have been built below a tailings dam, as was the case at Brumadinho. Dozens were probably buried alive while eating lunch. The latest tragedy is compounded by the crippling of the livelihood of the town, where mining is unlikely to continue. ""People worked at the mine so that they could feed their families,"" said Mr Ferreira, ""but mining destroyed Brumadinho.""","Brazil 's dam disaster

FROM THE air, the iron-ore mines in Minas Gerais look like roughshod capitalism let loose. Mines are torn out of the landscape, and ramshackle mining towns exist perilously close by. Squeezed within the dense topography are tailings dams, pools of waste material extracted from the mine that sit behind pharaonic embankments reaching dozens of storeys high. On January 25th an 86-metre-tall one owned by Vale, the world's biggest iron-ore producer, breached, unleashing a wave of sludge that may have killed more than 350 people. They included hundreds of the company's own employees, many of them having lunch in the cafeteria, recklessly sited below.
Such a death toll would make this one of the worst tailings tragedies in history; worse for instance than Aberfan in Wales in 1966, or Buffalo Creek, West Virginia in 1972. Even more damaging for Vale, this is the second such disaster in which it is implicated in just over three years. For the world's mining industry, too, it is cause for soul-searching. Similar tailings dams, which exist in their thousands around the world, mock mining's mantra of ""safety first"". At a time when the industry is under increasing pressure to put roughshod capitalism back in its box and respect land, local peoples and the law, this is a problem it cannot ignore.
As hopes of rescue fade, the immediate question for Vale is what went wrong-not once, but twice. In 2015 Samarco, a company jointly owned by Vale and BHP, an Anglo-Australian mining giant, suffered a similar tailings-dam disaster, causing the deaths of 19 people and the worst environmental mishap in Brazilian history. In the aftermath, one of Vale's proudest boasts was about the safety of its own operations. As recently as September, a Germanowned firm inspected the latest doomed mine near Brumadinho and gave it the all-clear. But it is an ""upstream"" dam, with a structure consisting of tailings on top of tailings, and the most vulnerable of all to failure. Experts say water seepage into the supporting dam face is the most common reason for them to burst. Days after the Brumadinho disaster, Fabio Schvartsman, Vale's chief executive, ordered the decommissioning of all ten of the firm's upstream tailings dams, halting production at the mines nearby, which will affect about a tenth of the company's 390m tonnes of annual ironore production.
This leads to a bigger question about Vale's future. Does the scale of the twin disasters threaten it with the sort of fines, lawsuits and damage to its reputation that BP, a British oil company, incurred after the Deepwater Horizon disaster in the Gulf of Mexico in 2010? The total bill for BP came to more than $6obn. There are four reasons to take potential Armageddon seriously. Since the disaster angry Brazilians have noted that, under Mr Schvartsman, Vale offered generous dividends and share buy-backs to investors, helping its share price double since he took over in 2017. They say some of the money should have been spent on safety instead.
If the authorities accept that line of reasoning, they could demand additional safety measures and shutdowns across Minas Gerais, where Vale mines about half of its iron ore. Second, it faces still undetermined damages for the Samarco disaster, which could rise as a result of the latest tragedy. Third, Brazil's top prosecutor has said she will pursue criminal charges against executives: three Vale employees and two contractors have been arrested. State authorities have quickly levelled fines against the company and frozen selected assets. Damages could soar. Fourth is morale. Vale's employees will mourn the loss of their colleagues, damaging motivation. Executives will be so worried about yet another accident that they lose their appetite for risk. The more listless the company, the more likely financial performance will suffer.
That said, this is crony-capitalist Brazil, not litigation-mad America. Though politicians argue that disasters in Brazil should be no less costly to big firms than those in the Gulf of Mexico, few would be willing to see Vale suffer the same drawn-out agony as BP. The firm says mining accounts for as much as 5% of Brazil's GDP. Vale's big shareholders are some of Brazil's top pension funds. It could compensate for shutdowns near Brumadinho by shifting production to the Amazon rainforest, where it has a more modern, safer mine. There are plenty of incentives for the new government of Jair Bolsonaro to be lenient, not least its pro-business bent. Initially Vale lost $19bn of its market capitalisation after the disaster, but then pared some losses. Its bond prices, though cheaper, are not indicating severe trouble ahead. Vale will probably soldier on.
Sludgefest
In corporate disasters such as this, rivals are usually quick to twist the knife. That happened to BP in 2010. But the industry should look at itself in the mirror. Mining firms claim to be obsessed with safety; in head offices, that can extend to absurdities like obliging visitors to hold on to handrails. Yet their record on tailings dams is abysmal. The more metals they mine, the more ""very serious"" accidents occur, involving deaths and large quantities of sludge. According to World Mine Tailings Failures (WMTF), a database, 13 have taken place in the decade to 2017, as many as between 1948 and 1977. WMTF experts say tailings dams fail at ten times the rate of reservoirs, mostly because of poor drainage. This indicates that the industry needs to tighten its engineering standards.
The reason firms continue to build upstream dams, such as the one at Brumadinho, is not because they are safe, but because they are cheap; they require the least amount of new material. Yet that is a false economy. Though markets reward mining firms for generating profits, not for spending heavily on safety measures, in the long run the risks are literally piling up. The world needs mining to continue, and these days, with big miners focusing on richer countries with high levels of scrutiny, that means taking corporate governance seriously, not just paying it lip service. To take it seriously means shutting down facilities that are dangerous.","A Brazilian tragedy is a Deepwater Horizon moment . Sort of

BRASILIA
Jair Bolsonaro scores a victory in the new congress
Brasilia is full of secrets. Normally, one of them is how senators vote when they elect the president of their chamber. On February 2nd they delivered a shock. The favourite for the job was Renan Calheiros, who had won it four times. A skilled dealmaker from the north-eastern state of Alagoas, he faces probes into allegations of graft, which he denies. His candidacy provoked two days of tumult, with shouting and shoving in the chamber. Some senators declared their voting intentions on Twitter, where the hashtag #RenanOut was trending. In one vote, the 81 senators mysteriously cast 82 ballots. Realising he would lose, Mr Calheiros dropped out.
This was a victory for Brazil's populist president, Jair Bolsonaro, who won an election in October by campaigning against such leaders of the establishment as Mr Calheiros. No one can accuse the senate's new president, Davi Alcolumbre (pictured), of being that. The 41-year-old firsttime senator (elected in 2014) has a long political history in Amapá, another poor north-eastern state, but is barely known outside it. His party, the Democrats, supports the government. Rodrigo Maia, the new speaker of the lower house of congress, is also a member. Three Democrats are ministers. Mr Alcolumbre's elevation is thus a good omen for the conservative social policies and liberal economic reforms that Mr Bolsonaro says he wants to enact. These include cuts to the growth of Brazil's absurdly generous pensions.
But the senate rebellion is also a sign of the risks the government could face if it loses public support. Mr Alcolumbre belongs to the ""lower clergy"" of backbench congressmen, as did Mr Bolsonaro before he became president. They have gained influence as grandees like Mr Calheiros have been tainted by scandals. That makes them less inclined to take direction from leaders of their parties. ""The rules of the game have changed,"" says Simone Tebet, a senator from the southern state of Mato Grosso do Sul. Although she belongs to the same party as Mr Calheiros, the Brazilian Democratic Movement, she voted against him.
Many members of the lower clergy are new to congress. Roughly half of legislators are serving their first terms. They tend to be more loyal to their Twitter followers than to their party leaders. Felipe Rigoni, Brazil's first blind congressman, says that he will support Mr Bolsonaro's plans to reform pensions even though fellow members of the opposition Brazilian Socialist Party are likely to oppose them. They ""are more blind than I am"", he says.
In the new congress, ""public opinion will be the key driver of legislative dynamics in a way it wasn't before,"" says Chris Garman of Eurasia Group, a consultancy. For now that favours Mr Bolsonaro, who has an approval rating of nearly 70%. That improves the odds that his two big policies, pension reform and a crackdown on crime and corruption, will get through congress.
Until now, Mr Bolsonaro has been reluctant to curb pension spending, even though it crowds out other public spending and slows economic growth. But on February 4th details of an ambitious proposal leaked to the press. Share prices surged.
Mr Bolsonaro is more gung-ho about the crime-fighting bit of his agenda, as are most Brazilians. On February 4th the justice minister, Sérgio Moro, presented his plans, which include tougher punishments for some criminals and milder ones for police who kill in the line of duty. That was well received. The hashtag #MoroinAction spread on Twitter.

 BRASILIA 
 Jair Bolsonaro scores a victory in the new congress 
 Brasilia is full of secrets . Normally , one of them is how senators vote when they elect the president of their chamber . On February 2nd they delivered a shock . The favourite for Jair Bolsonaro was Renan Calheiros , who had won Jair Bolsonaro four times . A skilled dealmaker from the north - eastern state of Alagoas , he faces probes into allegations of graft , which he denies . His candidacy provoked two days of tumult , with shouting and shoving in the chamber . Some senators declared their voting intentions on Twitter , where the hashtag # RenanOut was trending . In one vote , the 81 senators mysteriously cast 82 ballots . Realising he would lose , Mr Calheiros dropped out . 
 This was a victory for Brazil 's populist president , Jair Bolsonaro , who won an election in October by campaigning against such leaders of the establishment as Mr Calheiros . No one can accuse the senate 's new president , Davi Alcolumbre ( pictured ) , of being that . The 41 - year - old firsttime senator ( elected in 2014 ) has a long political history in Amapá , another poor north - eastern state , but is barely known outside it . His party , the Democrats , supports the government . Rodrigo Maia , the new speaker of the lower house of congress , is also a member . Three Democrats are ministers . Mr Alcolumbre 's elevation is thus a good omen for the conservative social policies and liberal economic reforms that Mr Bolsonaro says he wants to enact . These include cuts to the growth of Brazil 's absurdly generous pensions . 
 But the senate rebellion is also a sign of the risks the government could face if it loses public support . Mr Alcolumbre belongs to the "" lower clergy "" of backbench congressmen , as did Mr Bolsonaro before he became Jair Bolsonaro . They have gained influence as grandees like Mr Calheiros have been tainted by scandals . That makes them less inclined to take direction from leaders of their parties . "" The rules of the game have changed , "" says Simone Tebet , a senator from the southern state of Mato Grosso do Sul . Although she belongs to the same party as Mr Calheiros , the Brazilian Democratic Movement , she voted against him . 
 Many members of the lower clergy are new to congress . Roughly half of legislators are serving their first terms . They tend to be more loyal to their Twitter followers than to their party leaders . Felipe Rigoni , Brazil 's first blind congressman , says that he will support Mr Bolsonaro 's plans to reform pensions even though fellow members of the opposition Brazilian Socialist Party are likely to oppose them . They "" are more blind than I am "" , he says . 
 In the new congress , "" public opinion will be the key driver of legislative dynamics in a way it was n't before , "" says Chris Garman of Eurasia Group , a consultancy . For now that favours Mr Bolsonaro , who has an approval rating of nearly 70 % . That improves the odds that his two big policies , pension reform and a crackdown on crime and corruption , will get through congress . 
 Until now , Mr Bolsonaro has been reluctant to curb pension spending , even though it crowds out other public spending and slows economic growth . But on February 4th details of an ambitious proposal leaked to the press . Share prices surged . 
 Mr Bolsonaro is more gung - ho about the crime - fighting bit of his agenda , as are most Brazilians . On February 4th the justice minister , Sérgio Moro , presented his plans , which include tougher punishments for some criminals and milder ones for police who kill in the line of duty . That was well received . The hashtag # MoroinAction spread on Twitter . 
 But public acclaim is fickle . One threat to it comes from investigations of people who served on the staff of Mr Bolsonaro 's son , Flávio , who was a state congressman in Rio de Janeiro and is now a senator . His driver and aide , Fabricio Queiroz , is under scrutiny for receiving 7 m reais ( $ i.9 m ) in unexplained money transfers and for hiring the mother and wife of a fugitive former police officer accused of leading a criminal militia .

HE IS ONLY ten minutes late, which by the norms of Brazil's capital amounts to being early. Yet Sérgio Moro apologises profusely, explaining that he was called to a meeting with congressmen. The politeness and an occasional boyish smile are trademarks he deployed as Brazil's most media-adept judge. They should not be misread. There is a quiet steeliness to Mr Moro, who locked up a string of political and business heavyweights for corruption, including Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, a still-popular former president.
Having thus helped to prevent Lula from being a candidate in last year's presidential election, Mr Moro controversially went on to accept a job from its winner, Jair Bolsonaro, a firebrand who admires military dictators. He heads a beefed-up justice ministry, in charge also of public security, the federal police and an anti-money-laundering agency previously lodged in the finance ministry. His mission is to get the federal government to apply the same zeal as he did in his courtroom to the fight against corruption and organised and violent crime. It is a popular cause. But there are risks, both for his reputation and for Brazil.
Mr Bolsonaro's government has got off to a slow start, with much internal bickering. On February 13th the president left hospital after an 18-day stay to deal with the effects of a knife attack he suffered during the campaign. But Mr Moro has been quick off the mark. On February 4th he unveiled an anti-crime bill. This would impose tougher sentences for murder, armed robbery and corruption, and for association with several named criminal gangs. It would make illicit campaign donations a crime. And it would make it easier for police who kill to claim that they acted in self-defence. Police often have to face heavily armed criminals. But critics say they are too trigger-happy against young black men, and that Mr Moro's proposal is a licence to kill. Mr Bolsonaro has advocated giving police just that. Mr Moro rejects ""categorically"" the accusation that he is giving police permission to murder. His proposals ""are not discordant with what happens in other countries"", he says.
Much of Mr Moro's bill makes sense, as far as it goes. Brazilians voted for Mr Bolsonaro partly out of horror at the spread of violent crime. This is now affecting politics. In several places the old political machines have been taken over by organised crime, says Matias Spektor, an academic. Previous governments downplayed the power of criminal organisations, says Mr Moro. The state is now ""acknowledging them, and will act with rigour"".
Mr Moro's biggest tests lie beyond his bill. Reducing crime involves more than tighter laws. It needs better policing and community work in the favelas. Much of this is the job of state governors but requires co-ordination from the top. The minister says Mr Bolsonaro will do that. But it is hard to see the president being interested in such wonkery. He has already issued a decree liberalising gun ownership, against the advice of Mr Moro. Human-rights groups report an increase in hate crimes against women and gay people, whom Mr Bolsonaro has often publicly denigrated.
One of Mr Bolsonaro's sons, Flávio, a newly elected senator, is raising suspicious eyebrows. Investigators in Rio de Janeiro have found that $i.9m passed through the account of his driver, and that Flávio, when a state legislator, employed relatives of a fugitive former police officer accused of leading a paramilitary militia (Flávio denies wrongdoing). Mr Moro says that the police and prosecutors have complete freedom to investigate this case.
For some Brazilians, Mr Moro will be forever damned for having seemed to act at the edge of the law in his pursuit of Lula. To many others he is a hero. He insists that his mission is to apply the rule of law. ""It's important that he stays, because he's a moral figure,"" says Thiago Vidal, a political consultant in Brasilia. But Mr Vidal, like many, thinks that Mr Moro is eyeing a vacancy at the supreme court which will crop up next year (he neither confirms nor denies that).
Mr Moro is a celebrity in a cabinet long on military men and inexperienced or barely rational civilians. As with Paulo Guedes, the market-pleasing economy minister, Mr Bolsonaro needs Mr Moro more than the minister needs his boss. That gives him the clout to restrain a president whose past career and statements show little devotion to the rule of law. ""Any government should be judged by its actions,"" insists Mr Moro. That now includes him, too.","Brazil 's most famous graft - buster , Sérgio Moro , is now justice minister

Congress may yet water down Jair Bolsonaro's biggest economic reform
JAIR BOLSONARO won last October's presidential election in Brazil by railing against crime and corruption. But the success of his presidency depends on whether he can revive the torpid economy. He can only do that if he reassures investors by reforming the country's absurdly generous pension systems, which imperil public finances. On February 20th Mr Bolsonaro presented congress with a draft constitutional amendment to bring pension spending under control. He then went on television to promote a reform that he promised would ""change our history"".
Mr Bolsonaro has sent mixed signals on pensions, which funnel benefits mainly to better-off Brazilians and will become increasingly unaffordable as the population ages. The government spends 12% of GDP on pensions, compared with 8% among the rich countries of the OECD. Mr Bolsonaro raised hopes of reform by naming Paulo Guedes, a former investment banker and determined moderniser, as his economy minister. Mr Bolsonaro, who confesses to knowing little about economics, calls Mr Guedes his ""Posto Ipiranga"", a full-service petrol station. On the other hand, when he was a congressman Mr Bolsonaro opposed a pension-reform plan backed by the previous president, Michel Temer. After the election he criticised Mr Temer's scheme again, saying ""we can't save Brazil by killing old people.""
The package that the president proposed this week shows that Mr Guedes has won the argument, at least for the moment. It would set minimum retirement ages of 65 for most employed men and 62 for most women, which is what Mr Temer suggested. What's more, the proposed 12-year transition period is shorter than Mr Temer's 21 years. Currently, people start drawing pensions on average in their mid-50s, after paying into the system for at least 30 years.
The plan would raise contributions paid by people with higher incomes and limit the extent to which pensioners can collect more than one benefit. Rules for public servants would be brought closer to those for private-sector workers.
If congress enacts the proposal in full, the government would save 1.1trn reais ($295bn) over ten years, more than 1% of expected GDP over the period. That is higher than the 800bn reais of savings in Mr Temer's original plan. The package ""seems to go in the direction of reducing imbalances significantly,"" says Mario Mesquita, an economist at Itaú, a Brazilian bank.
It must now get through congress, where three-fifths majorities are needed in both houses to amend the constitution. Few observers expect it to pass without changes. The question is how damaging those changes will be. Congress cut the expected savings from Mr Temer's proposal in half. (It eventually failed after allegations of corruption forced him to spend all his political capital on persuading congress to shield him from prosecution.)
Mr Bolsonaro has advantages that his predecessor lacked. Allies lead both houses. Even politicians who do not support him now think that pensions must be fixed, as does the broader public. ""There's consensus about the need and urgency for reform,"" says Tasso Jereissati, a senator from the centrist Brazilian Social Democracy Party, which supports the government's economic agenda. BTG Pactual, an investment bank co-founded by Mr Guedes, found that 83% of congress members support some sort of pensions reform.
But, as Mr Jereissati admits, ""there's a wide spectrum"" of views about what sort. Just 38% of legislators agree with the proposed minimum ages. Most voters also think they are too high, according to a poll by XP Investimentos, a broker. Mr Bolsonaro has made his job harder by refusing to reward supporters with patronage, the normal way of forming majorities in congress.
His two-month-old presidency is already engulfed in scandal, which makes things still harder. The latest follows revelations by Folha de Sāo Paulo, a newspaper, that Mr Bolsonaro's Social Liberal Party had put up fake candidates in order to fill gender quotas and receive public campaign money. On February 18th Mr Bolsonaro sacked Gustavio Bebianno, the party's former chairman, from his cabinet job.
Such dramas will probably not destroy pension reform. Eurasia Group, a political consultancy, puts the odds of no reform at all this year at 30%. But they may weaken the government, forcing it to make concessions to interest groups that would be hurt by change. Already, proposals for new rules for military pensions have been postponed by 30 days. Moody's, a credit-rating agency, predicts that congress will reduce savings from the reform to 600bn-800bn reais. Even so, investors would be reassured, Moody's says.
Mr Guedes's ambitions do not end with pension reform. They include simplifying the tax code and reducing barriers to imports. ""We're going to privatise everything,"" says a member of his team. To achieve such goals, Mr Guedes will have to overcome opposition from the retired generals in Mr Bolsonaro's cabinet, who are loth to sell such ""strategic"" assets as Petrobras, the state-controlled oil company. Industry will resist lower import barriers.
Right now, the government is throwing its weight behind ""nova previdencia"" (""new pensions""). The economy ministry reportedly plans a social-media blitz to argue that reform will reduce inequality, create jobs and release money for such public services as health and education. All that is true, and has been for a long time. Perhaps this time Brazilians will believe it.","Brazilian politics

The latest follows revelations by Folha de Sāo Paulo , a newspaper , that Jair Bolsonaro's Social Liberal Party had put up fake candidates in order to fill gender quotas and receive public campaign money . On February 18th Jair Bolsonaro sacked Gustavio Bebianno , the party 's former chairman , from his cabinet job . 
 Such dramas will probably not destroy pension reform . Eurasia Group , a political consultancy , puts the odds of no reform at all this year at 30 % . But they may weaken the government , forcing it to make concessions to interest groups that would be hurt by change . Already , proposals for new rules for military pensions have been postponed by 30 days . Moody 's , a credit - rating agency , predicts that congress will reduce savings from the reform to 600bn-800bn reais . Even so , investors would be reassured , Moody 's says . 
 Mr Guedes 's ambitions do not end with pension reform . They include simplifying the tax code and reducing barriers to imports . "" We 're going to privatise everything , "" says a member of his team . To achieve such goals , Mr Guedes will have to overcome opposition from the retired generals in Jair Bolsonaro's cabinet , who are loth to sell such "" strategic "" assets as Petrobras , the state - controlled oil company . Industry will resist lower import barriers . 
 Right now , the government is throwing its weight behind "" nova previdencia "" ( "" new pensions "" ) . The economy ministry reportedly plans a social - media blitz to argue that reform will reduce inequality , create jobs and release money for such public services as health and education . All that is true , and has been for a long time . Perhaps this time Brazilians will believe it .",140,Brazil,ctb-140-2,IN TERM,True,Jair Bolsonaro 's,27,True

Pakistan captured an Indian pilot. The fighting is the worst since 1999, and marks the first time since the two countries acquired nuclear weapons that they have conducted bombing raids against one another.
Donald Trump walked away from his summit with Kim Jong Un, North Korea's dictator, in Vietnam. The talks broke down when the North Koreans pushed for all sanctions to be lifted in exchange for dismantling Yongbyon, an old nuclear facility. America wants the North to reveal where all its nuclear weapons are stored, as a prelude to dismantling them.
Un-American activities
Michael Cohen, Mr Trump's former lawyer and fixer, testified against his former boss before Congress. He accused the president of being a ""racist"", and a ""cheat"", as well as a ""con man"" for suppressing the publication of his high-school and college grades. Mr Cohen has already pleaded guilty to several charges, some of which are related to his work for Mr Trump. The White House said no one should trust the testimony of a ""disgraced felon"".
Lori Lightfoot and Toni Preckwinkle came out on top in Chicago's mayoral election and will advance to the run-off on April 2nd. The city will now get its first black female mayor, and if Ms Lightfoot wins, also the first gay person to hold the office. William Daley, a scion of Chicago's most famous political dynasty, came third.
On the brink
Venezuela's dictatorship blocked deliveries of aid, which it sees as a foreign attempt to undermine it. Police, national guardsmen and paramilitary groups drove back lorries carrying food and medical supplies, and used tear gas and rubber bullets to disperse people who were trying to escort the aid. Some live bullets were fired, too. Around 300 people were injured and four were killed. Hundreds of Venezuelan soldiers and police deserted. Some of their families were reportedly tortured or raped to discourage further defections. At a meeting attended by Mike Pence, the American vice-president, ten members of the Lima Group of mostly Latin American countries repeated their support for Juan Guaidó, who is recognised as Venezuela's interim president by Venezuela's legislature and by most western democracies. But they ruled out military intervention to topple the regime led by Nicolás Maduro.
In a referendum 87% of participants approved a new constitution for Cuba, which will legalise private property, subject to restrictions by the state, and limit the president to two five-year terms.
Brazil's education minister asked all schools to film their pupils singing the national anthem and to send the films to the government. He also asked schools to read out a message that ends ""Brazil above all. God above everyone"". 1
That was the campaign slogan of the country's new president, Jair Bolsonaro. The minister later admitted that asking schools to read the slogan was a mistake.
Shifting sands
Theresa May, Britain's prime minister, conceded some ground to Parliament over Brexit. As well as voting on her revised withdrawal agreement with the European Union, MPS will also have an option to take ""no deal"" off the table if her plan is rejected. If MPS reject no-deal, they will then vote on whether to ask for an extension past March 29th, which is when Britain is due to leave the EU . Labour also made a significant shift when its leader, Jeremy Corbyn, said it would back a second referendum.
Poland's government announced a package of tax cuts and spending, including a bonus for pensioners and hefty handouts to parents. The package could cost as much as 2% of GDP. The ruling party faces a tough election this year.
eu leaders visited Sharm elSheikh in Egypt to meet leaders of Arab League countries and ask for help in keeping refugees out of Europe. The atrocious human-rights records of some participants were barely mentioned.
Staying power
In the face of huge protests against his dictatorship, President Omar al-Bashir declared a state of emergency in Sudan, dissolving the federal government and replacing all state governors with military and security men. He is still far from secure. Despite a ban on unauthorised gatherings, the protests continued.
In a surprise move Muhammad Javad Zarif, Iran's foreign minister, publicly offered to resign. The move laid bare the struggle for control of Iran's foreign policy between pragmatists, such as Mr Zarif and President Hassan Rouhani, and hardliners. Mr Rouhani rejected the resignation.
King Salman of Saudi Arabia named Princess Reema bint Bandar bin Sultan ambassador to America, the first time a woman has been named to such a post.
Muhammadu Buhari was re-elected president of Nigeria. At least 39 people were killed in election-related attacks-fewer than during previous ballots. The opposition claims that the vote was rigged, but observers seem to think it was clean enough.
Tens of thousands of Algerians protested against President Abdelaziz Bouteflika's decision to run for a fifth term. The octogenarian leader has made few public appearances since 2013. Most Algerians expect the vote on April 18th to be fixed by the cabal of power brokers who run the country.

America closed its consulategeneral in Jerusalem, which had acted as a de facto embassy to the Palestinians. The State Department said this did not signal a change in policy; the consulate's operations will be handled by the new American embassy to Israel in the city. But the Palestinians suggested that it further undermined America's role as peacemaker.
The Netherlands recalled its ambassador to Iran after the government in Tehran expelled two Dutch diplomats. Tension between the countries has risen since last year, when the Dutch government expelled two Iranian embassy workers over suspicion that Iran was involved in the assassination of two Dutch-Iranian citizens.
Rwanda accused neighbouring Uganda of supporting rebel movements aimed at overthrowing its president, Paul Kagame, and closed a key border crossing between the two countries. Relations between the two countries have soured as they battle for influence in the eastern part of the Democratic Republic of Congo.
Lowering the horizon
China's prime minister, Li Keqiang, said the country would aim for GDP growth this year of between 6% and 6.5%, down from 6.6% last year and the slowest rate in nearly three decades. He was speaking at the start of the annual ten-day session of China's rubberstamp parliament. Mr Li said the economy faced danger from abroad, a reference to the trade war with America.
Satellite images suggested that North Korea is rebuilding a facility it had used to launch satellites and test missile engines, but had partially dismantled. The construction was interpreted as a signal that the country might resume testing missiles if it did not get its way in stalled talks with America about nuclear disarmament.
Pakistan arrested dozens of militants in a clampdown after the Jaish-e-Muhammad group claimed responsibility for a terrorist attack in which 40 Indian paramilitary policemen were killed, causing a military face-off with India. India's politicians, meanwhile, rowed about how effective its air strikes against an alleged terrorist training camp in Pakistan had been.
Thailand's constitutional court banned Thai Raksa Chart, a party linked to Thaksin Shinawatra, an exiled former prime minister. The party had upset King Vajiralongkorn by nominating his sister for prime minister.

A man in London may become only the second person in the world to be cured of HIV infection. A stem-cell transplant to treat lymphoma means his immune-system cells are now coated with proteins that HIV cannot latch onto. An American who had similar treatment in 2007 still remains free of the virus.

Michael Bloomberg ruled out a run for the American presidency in 2020, disappointing those who wanted a strong moderate voice in the race.
America's border-protection agency reported a sharp rise in the number of migrants trying to cross from Mexico illegally. More than 76,000 people tried to cross in February, the highest number for that month in 12 years. Families and children without parents accounted for 60% of the 66,450 who were apprehended; they came predominantly from Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador. Illegal crossings remain far below their peak in the 1990s.

Juan Guaidó, recognised as Venezuela's interim president by the legislature and by more than 50 countries, returned to the country after a failed attempt to send in humanitarian aid and a tour of Latin American capitals. He was greeted by large crowds opposed to the dictatorial regime of Nicolás Maduro.
Jane Philpott, the president of Canada's Treasury Board, which oversees government spending, quit the cabinet in dismay over allegations that the office of the prime minister, Justin Trudeau, had tried to improperly influence the judiciary.

An actor could be Ukraine's next president
A MEMORIAL COMPLEX featuring photographs of brave protesters fills Kiev's Independence Square, or Maidan. Displays reproduce Ukrainians' Facebook posts from key moments during the movement that overthrew the former president, Viktor Yanukovych, five years ago. ""I stopped counting covered bodies,"" reads one, recalling the day when police opened fire on demonstrators. ""How many of them are there?"" The revolution was dubbed the ""Revolution of Dignity"". Yet ahead of a presidential election on March 31st, the campaign is anything but dignified.
Among more than 40 candidates, the front-runner is Volodymyr Zelensky, a comedian and actor best known for playing a teacher who becomes president in a popular television show called ""Servant of the Nation"". He is now attempting to turn make-believe into reality, presenting himself as a fresh face to a population frustrated with the old elite. ""People want to show the authorities the middle finger, and he is playing the role of this middle finger,"" says Volodymyr Fesenko, a political analyst.
incumbent president, Petro Poroshenko, and a former prime minister, Yulia Tymoshenko. Many reformers had pinned their hopes on Slava Vakarchuk, a rock star who declined to run. Anatoliy Hrytsenko, a former defence minister, has the backing of many opinion-formers but few voters. The choice in the second-round run-off, on April 21st, will be between the lesser of two evils, and the stakes are high.
Ukrainians are frustrated with their The two other main contenders are the post-revolutionary leadership. Threequarters of them say the country is headed in the wrong direction, despite the fact that Ukraine has moved closer to Europe (it now has visa-free travel to the EU, for instance). That is because the central promise of the revolution-uprooting the country's deeply corrupt, oligarch-controlled political system-remains unfulfilled. A recent Supreme Court decision to strike down a key anti-graft law passed in 2015 exemplifies the backsliding. Falling living standards, rising utility bills and a simmering war with Russia in the country's east have meant steep sacrifices for ordinary people. Polls show that more Ukrainians now mistrust their own Rada (parliament) than they do the Russian media, which spew propaganda to fuel the conflict.
Nowhere is the oligarchs' enduring influence more evident than in the campaign. A successful presidential run requires exposure on television, but the main channels are still owned by oligarchs. ""We made a revolution, but you can't win elections when the oligarchs control the media,"" says Vitaliy Shabunin, an anti-corruption activist. The main oligarchic contest is between President Poroshenko, a sweets magnate whose net worth has grown while in office and who owns his own TV channel, and Ihor Kolomoisky, a billionaire who saw his bank, PrivatBank, nationalised and accused of fraud. Mr Zelensky's ties to Mr Kolomoisky have raised eyebrows. His show runs on Mr Kolomoisky's network, 1+1, which has promoted Mr Zelensky's presidential bid; his circle includes people close to the oligarch. (Both men deny any links.) Yet some reformers and many voters see him, however imperfect, as the only chance for change. ""We've had lots of experienced folk, but haven't got anything from them,"" says a schoolteacher eyeing the Maidan memorial.
One evening earlier this month, Mr Zelensky could be found on set in a chilly Kiev basement, in costume as his man-of-the-people-turned-president character, Vasyl Holoborodko. The show's latest season, set to air in the heat of the campaign, serves as Mr Zelensky's main political advertising. In one scene being filmed, Mr Zelensky's character prepares to take the oath of office. A trio of historical figures-Plato, Prince Vladimir of Kiev and the Slavic philosopher Grigory Skovoroda-emerge from the shadows to advise the would-be president. ""What is power?"" Plato muses.
What Mr Zelensky would do with power remains a mystery. ""I want to do something to change the mistrust towards politicians,"" Mr Zelensky says, unhelpfully. He has offered little indication of what exactly he plans to do, beyond vague assurances to maintain Ukraine's Western course, improve the investment climate and end the war in the east. He has promised to crowdsource his cabinet and his policies. When pressed to name world leaders he admired, Mr Zelensky invoked Brazil's Jair Bolsonaro, a right-wing populist, and France's Emmanuel Macron, a liberal technocrat. Western diplomats find him frighteningly unprepared. Many fret that Vladimir Putin will gobble him up like one of Mr Poroshenko's chocolate bars.
The old guard hopes that voters will opt for experience once more. Mr Poroshenko is running on a platform of ""army, faith and language"", pushing patriotism to distract from his failure to fight corruption. Ms Tymoshenko has reinvented herself as a populist, raging against the IMF and its demands that Ukraine raise its gas prices to market rates. Both hope to win the likely run-off with Mr Zelensky on April 21st, and then to compete for control over the Rada in a parliamentary election due in October.
What worries observers more than who will win is whether the election will be seen as legitimate. Many fear Russian disinformation and hacking. A greater threat, however, may come from the candidates themselves. Both Mr Poroshenko and Ms Tymoshenko have faced allegations of vote-buying. The presence of private armies with murky loyalties, an angry populace and an abundance of weapons makes for a volatile mix, as seen last week when dozens of officers were wounded in clashes with ultranationalists opposed to Mr Poroshenko. If Ukrainians wake up on April 1st distrusting the results of the first round, it will be no laughing matter.","Ukraine

SAO PAULO
Jair Bolsonaro is a master of social media. But to what end?
POLITICIANS START working only when Carnival ends, Brazilians joke. This year explosive tweets from the president, Jair Bolsonaro, delayed the serious business of reforming pensions and cleaning up crime and corruption. On March 5th the president posted a video of one Carnival reveller urinating on another in an act of performance art. ""This is what many Carnival street parties have become,"" he lamented. Some Brazilians cringed, but the tweet got 87,000 likes.
Then on March 10th Mr Bolsonaro excoriated a journalist from Estado de S. Paulo who is investigating his son, Flávio, a senator from Rio de Janeiro. EstadāoMentiu (""EstadoLied"") became the top trending topic on Twitter in Brazil. The bar association criticised the president. But he has not taken down either tweet.
Mr Bolsonaro relies on social media even more than does Donald Trump, some of whose views of the world he shares. They are due to meet in Washington on March 19th. Unlike the American president he does not hold raucous rallies. In contrast to Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, a left-wing former Brazilian president who is now serving a prison sentence for corruption, he does not relish physical contact with his supporters. He largely avoids appearances on the main television stations. Instead, Mr Bolsonaro reaches most Brazilians in miniature, via their smartphones.
His success may owe something to Brazilians' sizzling passion for social media. More Brazilians were on Orkut, a social network owned by Google, than citizens of any other country. As late as 2011 Orkut had 33m Brazilian users. After the network's demise in 2014, Brazilians became the third-largest nationality on Facebook, after Indians and Americans.
Social media were Mr Bolsonaro's only outlets when he launched his long-shot presidential campaign from the backbenches of Brazil's congress. His tiny electoral coalition gave him little entitlement to free television and radio time.
Angered by violence, scandals and a deep recession, voters were ready for Mr Bolsonaro's chest-thumping messages on crime, corruption and family values. His early supporters distrust mainstream media, says Esther Solano of the Federal University of Sāo Paulo, who has interviewed dozens of them. ""They assume that social media is more sincere, because it's filled with friends and family.""
As president, Mr Bolsonaro still posts often to his 10.7m Facebook followers and the 3.7m people who follow him on Twitter. (Another of his sons, Carlos, a city councillor in Rio de Janeiro, is thought to manage the accounts and write many of his epigrams.) On March 7th the president gave a 20-minute talk on Facebook Live, the first of what he said would be a weekly series.
The question is whether he can or will use such events to promote his government's most important programmes. Unlike Mr Trump, he makes no pretence of being an expert in most policy areas. He has outsourced pension reform, which is vital to stabilising the government's finances, to Paulo Guedes, the liberal economy minister, and law enforcement to Sérgio Moro, the justice minister.
Mr Bolsonaro uses social media to gratify his supporters more than to enlighten them. An analysis by Estado of his first 515 tweets as president, sent between January 1st and March 5th, found that 95 of them congratulated friends and allies, 51 were ideological, 31 criticised the press, 30 rebutted criticism and just five mentioned pension reform. When he does broach reforms, his supporters push back. ""If I'd known he would send Paulo Guedes's rigid proposal (Trojan Horse) to congress, I never would have voted for him,"" one woman wrote on Facebook.
But Mr Bolsonaro will have to risk that sort of backlash. Unlike past presidents, he does not have a big coalition held together by patronage and pork-barrel spending (though the government did recently offer ibn reais, or $26om, for congressmen's pet projects). To advance his agenda, he needs to rally ordinary citizens more than his predecessors did. Hamilton Mourāo, the vicepresident, says Mr Bolsonaro should use social networks ""in language that people understand, to convince them that the current [pension] system has been drained and the country will be ungovernable if we continue like this"".
Mr Bolsonaro may be heeding him. In his first Facebook fireside chat he spent 90 seconds talking up ""nova previdencia"" (""new pensions"") before returning to more congenial subjects. He lambasted the government for distributing pamphlets on sexual health to adolescents and promised to phase out speed cameras. Perhaps that is the way to sell pension reform. Brazilians must hope so.","Jair Bolsonaro is a master of social media . But to what end ?

One of the main reasons why Jair Bolsonaro won last year's presidential election in Brazil is that he promised to get the economy moving again after four years of slump. By naming Paulo Guedes, a free-marketeer, as his economic super-minister, he won the backing of big business and finance. Many assumed that the arrival of Mr Bolsonaro's government in itself would breathe life into the economy. But three months in, it remains as moribund as ever. Investors are starting to realise that Mr Guedes faces an uphill task to get congress to approve a pension reform that is crucial for Brazil's fiscal health. And Mr Bolsonaro himself is not helping.
A fiscal deficit of 7% of gdp weighs heavily on the economy, meaning that interest rates for private borrowers are higher than they would otherwise be. Pensions account for a third of total public spending, and are one reason why the state spends little on Brazil's skeletal infrastructure. The government's reform bill, sent to congress last month, imposes a minimum retirement age, raises contributions and closes loopholes. It is supposed to yield savings of i.2trn reais ($3iobn) over ten years. Last year's pension deficit was 24.ibn reais. On its own, pension reform is not enough to return Brazil to robust economic growth. That requires tax reforms and other measures to boost competitiveness. But it has become a totem.
Mr Bolsonaro is fortunate that after two years of political and public debate, pension reform is less unpopular than it was. But it is not exactly a vote-winner. Mr Bolsonaro didn't campaign on it. ""The whole discussion on pension reform is something Brazilians would rather not have,"" says Monica de Bolle, a Brazilian economist at the Peterson Institute for International Economics, a think-tank.
Approval thus requires leadership from the top. That is absent. In his campaign Mr Bolsonaro denounced the corrupt ""old politics"" of pork-barrel bargaining in congress. Yet he has no alternative strategy to command the legislature. He has needlessly antagonised some allies, including Rodrigo Maia, the powerful speaker of the lower house. His father-in-law, Wellington Moreira Franco, a former minister, was briefly arrested on March 21st along with Michel Temer, the president in 2016-18, on suspicion of bribery, which they deny. That prompted comments from one of Mr Bolsonaro's sons, who are his closest aides, which Mr Maia took as a personal attack. His riposte was that he would not round up votes on pension reform for a government he called ""a desert of ideas"". Officials this week tried to mollify Mr Maia. But pension reform seems certain to suffer both delays and dilution.
The bigger problem is that Mr Bolsonaro has yet to show that he understands his new job. He has dissipated political capital on his prejudices, for example by calling for the armed forces to commemorate the anniversary on March 31st of a military coup in 1964. His is a government of ""monumental confusion"", says Claudio Couto of Fundaçâo Getulio Vargas, a university. Apart from the economic team, it is a warring assortment of retired generals, mid-ranking politicians, evangelical Protestants and far-right ideologues named by Olavo de Carvalho, a previously obscure philosopher. ""Nobody knows where he's going, what's the course he's setting,"" says Fernando Henrique Cardoso, a former president, of Mr Bolsonaro. ""He goes forward then back, all the time.""
If the government has a linchpin, it is General Hamilton Mourāo, the vicepresident, who has attempted to impose some political discipline. Yet he is often at odds with the Bolsonaro family. Mr de Carvalho has called General Mourāo an ""idiot"", and said that if things continue as they are for the next six months ""it's all over."" Though they apportion the blame differently, others are starting to think the same. To cap it all, evidence is emerging that the Bolsonaro family was acquainted with members of a criminal group of former police in Rio de Janeiro accused of murdering Marielle Franco, an activist (and no relation of Wellington). They deny any link.
Two of Brazil's four previous elected presidents have been impeached because, as Mr Cardoso (who wasn't) says, ""they stopped being able to govern."" However much they abhor Mr Bolsonaro, democrats should not want him to fail to complete his term. It is still early days. But already his presidency faces a crucial test. ""We have two alternatives,"" his spokesman said this week. ""Approve pension reform or sink into a bottomless pit."" If only his boss were as clear.","Unless Jair Bolsonaro stops provoking and learns to govern , Jair Bolsonaro's tenure could be short

SĀO PAULO
The country's biggest corruption investigation is at a turning point
For five years Lava Jato (Car Wash), a sprawling anti-corruption investigation, has dominated headlines in Brazil. It ended political careers, led to the lockingup of company bosses and helped make possible last year the election of Jair Bolsonaro, a low-ranking right-wing congressman, to Brazil's presidency. He fulminated against corruption during the campaign, but the investigation itself disappeared from the headlines. The arrest last month of Michel Temer, a former president, brought it back. Prosecutors say he ran a scheme that embezzled up to 1.8bn reais ($427m) over four decades, including during his presidency in 2016-18. Mr Temer denies the charges. A judge released him while the investigation continues.
Lava Jato began as a routine moneylaundering case in the southern city of Curitiba. It led to revelations that construction companies had paid billions of dollars in bribes to politicians in exchange for lucrative contracts with Petrobras, the statecontrolled oil company. Prosecutors in Curitiba have won convictions of 155 people, and prison sentences totalling more than 2,000 years. Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, a former president from the left-wing Workers' Party, is serving jail sentences totalling 25 years in the city. Investigations in Curitiba and in other cities have led to scores of convictions and billions of dollars in fines (see table overleaf). Brazilian prosecutors have helped foreign ones pursue related cases, especially in Peru. Mr Bolsonaro appointed Sérgio Moro, the judge who jailed Lula, to be his justice minister.
Through Lava Jato Brazilians have come to view systemic corruption as outrageous rather than inevitable. Citizens held massive demonstrations against it and voted corrupt politicians out of office. Businesses have created compliance departments. The supreme court banned corporate contributions to election campaigns and ruled that convicted criminals could be jailed after losing their first appeal (rather than remaining free until all their appeals were exhausted). Lava Jato has both encouraged and benefited from public anger. ""Without society's insistence, we wouldn't have Lava Jato,"" says Deltan Dallagnol, a prosecutor.
It grinds on. Hundreds of suspects besides Mr Temer await rulings from courts in Curitiba and other cities, where other corruption schemes are being investigated. But this sort of investigation ""looks to the past"", says Silvana Batini, a prosecutor for Lava Jato's task force in Rio.
Its future is uncertain. Mr Moro's move from the courtroom to Mr Bolsonaro's cabinet is a chance to strengthen anti-corruption laws and beef up enforcement. Yet Lava Jato faces new challenges, which could reverse the progress Brazil has made against political graft. One comes from congress, which could thwart Mr Moro's attempts at reform. Another is that the supreme court, initially supportive of the investigation, has turned sceptical. That is partly in response to excesses by prosecutors and judges such as Mr Moro, and partly because of pressure from politicians.
A third threat is the demagogic response of Mr Bolsonaro's supporters to such setbacks. They accuse the highest court of being in league with the velha política (old politics). One of Mr Bolsonaro's sons, Eduardo, a federal deputy from Sāo Paulo, said before the election that a ""soldier and a corporal"" could shut the court down. Taking a different tack, Mr Bolsonaro proposed doubling the number of justices, so he could pack it with his appointees. Such zealotry in defence of the rule of law could end up weakening it.
Lava Jato was born from two trends: the strengthening of Brazil's judiciary and the weakening of its political system. A harbinger was the mensalāo, a scandal during Lula's presidency in 2005 that involved the government buying votes in congress. A new generation of prosecutors and judges won its spurs through trials of the miscreants. When Lava Jato began in 2014 judicial officials had new tools: agreements to share information on money-laundering with other countries; a law passed in 2010 that bans politicians with corruption convictions (such as Lula) from running for office; and, most important, a law from 2013 that expanded the use of plea bargaining. Without it, ""we'd still be stuck going after money-launderers for 10,000 reais,"" says Paulo Galvāo, a Lava Jato prosecutor.
Politicians' reputations sank. Brazilians' anger about corruption and economic recession led to the impeachment of President Dilma Rousseff in 2016 (for budgetaccounting violations, not corruption). Mr Temer, her successor, spent political capital fending off corruption allegations. The prestige of the judiciary rose. It began to act as if it could ""solve all of Brazil's problems"", says Oscar Vilhena, the dean of the law school at Fundaçao Getulio Vargas (fgv).
Investigators, led by judges like Mr Moro, became more aggressive and less careful. They made liberal use of pre-trial detention and arrested suspects to force them to testify. Both practices are banned by the constitution in most circumstances. Whereas American prosecutors spent decades refining the practice of plea bargaining before using it to clobber mafia dons, its swift deployment in Lava Jato was akin to ""changing the tyre as you drive"", says Matthew Taylor of American University in Washington, dc.
The ""ends-justify-the-means"" attitude led to mistakes, says Heloisa Estellita, a former clerk of the supreme court. In 2016, in an apparent attempt to stop Ms Rousseff appointing Lula as minister, which would have shielded him from prosecution, Mr Moro leaked to the media taped conversations between them. That aroused suspicions among their supporters that the judge was targeting the left. Suspicion increased when he agreed to join the cabinet. In 2017 Lava Jato prosecutors gave immunity to two businessmen who claimed to have bribed Mr Temer. The information they provided was incomplete. It later emerged that one prosecutor was also working for the law firm defending them.
That error became Lava Jato's ""Trojan horse"", says Felipe Recondo, a founder of Jota, a news site that focuses on Brazil's judiciary. It helped bring about a new confrontation within the judiciary, between Lava Jato operatives and the supreme court. Mr Bolsonaro and most Brazilians back the investigators. Politicians tend to root for the higher court. Much will depend on the outcome of that duel.
Many Brazilians regard the supreme court as an ally of corrupt politicians. In part that is because sitting politicians enjoy a right called foro privilegiado. This means that only the supreme court can try them for acts of corruption they commit while in office. The overburdened court almost never convicts. It heard 404 cases against politicians between 2011 and 2016 but issued guilty verdicts in just three. After the death in 2017 of one gung-ho justice and missteps by investigators, the court became more sceptical of Lava Jato.
The new bench has issued politicianfriendly rulings. Some, like limits on plea bargaining and a ban on coercive questioning, corrected excesses. Others seemed arbitrary, like the release of a former minister who had been convicted of corruption and lost his first appeal. One justice, Gilmar Mendes, freed 19 defendants in 30 days in 2018. ""The supreme court does not exist,"" says Conrado Hübner Mendes, a law professor at the University of Sāo Paulo. ""There are 11 mouths and 11 pens.""
It will soon be at the centre of another controversy. It plans to reconsider its earlier ruling that people convicted of crimes can be jailed after they lose their first appeal. A reversal of that decision could result in the release of thousands of convicts not deemed a danger to society, including ordinary criminals. It could also undermine Lava Jato, investigators fear, by weakening suspects' incentive to co-operate.
Such a decision could provoke popular as well as prosecutorial fury. It flared last month, when the supreme court ruled that electoral courts rather than criminal ones should deal with campaign-related corruption. Mr Bolsonaro's supporters erupted. The hashtag ASoldierACorporal trended again. The episode shows that Brazilians are apt to back pseudo-cures for impunity rather than the surer but slower remedy of building institutions. ""We are living in a populist Brazil, which is challenging for the rule of law,"" says Ms Estellita.
Institution-builders are looking to Mr Moro. He says he accepted the job in Mr Bolsonaro's cabinet to ensure that Lava Jato does not end up like Italy's ""clean hands"" investigations of the 1990s, which implicated a lot of politicians without changing the system. Mr Moro brought to his first meeting with Mr Bolsonaro a 624-page document called ""New Measures Against Corruption"", drawn up by fgv and Transparency International, a watchdog.
But politics may limit Mr Moro's ambitions. His first anti-crime bill has some valuable ideas, including protection for whistleblowers and a longer statute of limitations for corruption. But it leaves out many useful anti-graft measures, such as ending foro privilegiado. Congressional resistance forced him to delay a proposal to criminalise illegal campaign donations.
Now the Bolsonaro family itself is facing scrutiny from investigators, which may cool its enthusiasm for graft-busting. In January another of the president's sons, Flávio, a senator from Rio de Janeiro, tried to claim foro privilegiado to avoid an inquiry into suspicious transactions recorded in the bank account of his driver. If such scandals multiply, Lava Jato's most vociferous allies could become its worst enemies. ?","Brazil 
 SĀO PAULO 
 The country 's biggest corruption investigation is at a turning point 
 For five years Lava Jato ( Car Wash ) , a sprawling anti - corruption investigation , has dominated headlines in Brazil . It ended political careers , led to the lockingup of company bosses and helped make possible last year the election of Jair Bolsonaro to Brazil 's presidency . Jair Bolsonaro fulminated against corruption during the campaign , but the investigation itself disappeared from the headlines . The arrest last month of Michel Temer , a former president , brought it back . Prosecutors say he ran a scheme that embezzled up to 1.8bn reais ( $ 427 m ) over four decades , including during his presidency in 2016 - 18 . Mr Temer denies the charges . A judge released him while the investigation continues . 
 Lava Jato began as a routine moneylaundering case in the southern city of Curitiba . It led to revelations that construction companies had paid billions of dollars in bribes to politicians in exchange for lucrative contracts with Petrobras , the statecontrolled oil company . Prosecutors in Curitiba have won convictions of 155 people , and prison sentences totalling more than 2,000 years . Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva , a former president from the left - wing Workers ' Party , is serving jail sentences totalling 25 years in the city . Investigations in Curitiba and in other cities have led to scores of convictions and billions of dollars in fines ( see table overleaf ) . Brazilian prosecutors have helped foreign ones pursue related cases , especially in Peru . Jair Bolsonaro appointed Sérgio Moro , the judge who jailed Lula , to be Jair Bolsonaro's justice minister . 
 Through Lava Jato Brazilians have come to view systemic corruption as outrageous rather than inevitable . Citizens held massive demonstrations against it and voted corrupt politicians out of office . Businesses have created compliance departments . The supreme court banned corporate contributions to election campaigns and ruled that convicted criminals could be jailed after losing their first appeal ( rather than remaining free until all their appeals were exhausted ) . Lava Jato has both encouraged and benefited from public anger . "" Without society 's insistence , we would n't have Lava Jato , "" says Deltan Dallagnol , a prosecutor .

The Finns Party, an anti-immigrant outfit, won 17% of the vote in Finland's election. Other parties do not want to work with it. The winning Social Democrats will try to form a government without it.
Britain pondered what to do with Julian Assange, a cofounder of WikiLeaks.

Nigel Farage, one of the prime movers behind Britain's referendum on leaving the eu in 2016, launched a Brexit Party to fight next month's European elections. Change uk, a group of Labour and Conservative defectors who are pushing for a second referendum in the hope of cancelling Brexit, received approval from the Electoral Commission to form a party.
The strongman gets stronger
Egypt's parliament passed constitutional amendments that would allow President Abdel-Fattah al-Sisi to rule until 2030. Mr Sisi, a former general, was re-elected in 2018 with 98% of the vote. Other changes would give the president control over judges and increase the army's political power. The amendments will now be put to a referendum.

No escape
Spain arrested Hugo Carvajal, a former head of Venezuela's military intelligence service, after America asked for his extradition. He had defected and called on the army to stop supporting Venezuela's dictator, Nicolás Maduro. His arrest on drug-trafficking charges may discourage other bigwigs from abandoning Mr Maduro, thus impeding America's goal of removing him.
The natural history museum in New York decided not to provide the venue for a gala honouring Brazil's president, Jair Bolsonaro. Environmentalists, outraged at his plan to open up Brazil's rainforest to mining, had objected.
The United Conservative Party won an election in the oil- producing Canadian province of Alberta. The incoming premier, Jason Kenney, is expected to abolish the province's tax on carbon emissions and to challenge the federal policy of imposing a carbon price on provinces that do not have their own.
""A non-starter""
Nancy Pelosi, the Speaker of America's House of Representatives, warned the British government that there would be ""no chance whatsoever"" of a free-trade deal with America if Brexit caused any disruption to the two-decade-old AngloIrish peace agreement. The peace deal depends on an open border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland-something eu membership conveniently supplied.
Donald Trump blocked a bipartisan resolution in Congress to end American military aid to Saudi Arabia in the Yemen war. It was only the second veto of his presidency.
Pete Buttigieg officially launched his campaign to be the Democrats' presidential candidate. Mr Buttigieg has surprised primary watchers by running well against betterknown rivals in the party's crowded field of nominees, quite an achievement for the mayor of South Bend, Indiana.
The first challenger to Donald Trump emerged for the Republican nomination. The longshot bid is from William Weld, a moderate and former governor of Massachusetts. Mr Trump raised $3om for his campaign in the first quarter, rivalling the combined amount of the top two Democrats.

RIO DE JANEIRO
Female MCS are changing the genre
CAROLINA DE OLIVEIRA LOURENÇO first heard the word ""feminism"" in 2015 from friends who were taking Brazil's college entrance exam, on which a question about it appeared. She was 22, and a rising star in the world of carioca funk, throbbing syncopated dance music born in the favelas of Rio de Janeiro. A year later, MC Carol, as she is known, released a song called ""100% Feminista"". The lyrics describe her tough childhood: ""I was five but I already understood/that a woman gets hit if she doesn't make food,"" she rapped. It was a hit. That did not stop nasty comments on social media about her appearance. ""It's not just hard to be a woman singing funk,"" says MC Carol, who calls herself black and fat. ""It's hard to be a woman, period.""
Funk, which has roots in American hip hop, is performed mostly by men. Its critics say its lyrics promote misogyny, promiscuity and crime. In 2017 20,000 Brazilians signed a petition calling on congress to declare it-along with bailes funk, massive dances where the music is played at earsplitting volume-a public-health violation. (The legislature refused.) A particular target is funk proibidão (taboo funk), in which explicit lyrics both glorify and lament violence. Funk ostentaçâo (ostentation funk), which celebrates money and fame, is especially popular in São Paulo.
MC Carol's mission, and that of other feminist funkeiras, is not to make the style less rude but to bring to it women's viewpoints. MC (a hip-hop title derived from ""master of ceremonies"") Carol started out singing putaria, a subgenre of proibidāo that's about sex. Some songs by women are frankly feminist. In the music video for ""Nāo Sou Obrigada"" (""I Don't Have To""), which appears on Spotify's Global Viral 50 list, MC Pocahontas chides her dopey boyfriend for bossing her around. In ""Cai de Boca"" (""Drop Your Mouth""), a putaria hit from 2018, MC Rebecca sings about men performing oral sex on women. A hair stylist and samba dancer from the favela Morro Sāo Joāo, she says the song is a call for sexual liberation in a world where ""women are still seen as submissive"".
Female funk performers and their messages bring new life to the subgenre ""coNSCientious funk"", says Andressa Oliveira of Liga do Funk, a group in São Paulo that trains artists. It draws some of its energy from opposition to Brazil's president, Jair Bolsonaro, who has aggressively conservative views on social issues. MC Rebecca, who came out as bisexual on Twitter, wrapped herself in a rainbow flag in a music video. Women are listening. ONErpm, a company that represents artists in negotiations with digital platforms, looked at data from YouTube for around 130 funk channels. It found that women are now 49.5% of the audience, up from 32% in 2014.
Female stars are giving Brazilian funk global appeal. Larissa Machado, who calls herself Anitta, started out in a church choir, made her name in Rio's funk scene and now has 37m Instagram followers, many of them abroad. The video for ""Vai Malandra"" (roughly, ""Go Hustler""), which was filmed in a Rio favela, has been viewed 352m times on YouTube. Anitta refused to airbrush out the cellulite on her thighs, delighting women. ""Vai Malandra"" is the first Portuguese-language song to reach Spotify's Global Top 50 list. That brought a singing gig with Madonna.
Kamilla Fialho, whose marketing company, K2L, helped shape Anitta's early career, compares her success to that of Beyoncé and Rihanna, who are politically active and flaunt their sexual empowerment. Her company is now coaching MC Rebecca by providing English lessons, among other things. Ms Fialho is not encouraging the young funkeira to stay away from the subject of sex. ""If you want polite music, listen to classical,"" she says.","Brazilian funk

In ""Cai de Boca"" (""Drop Your Mouth""), a putaria hit from 2018, MC Rebecca sings about men performing oral sex on women. A hair stylist and samba dancer from the favela Morro Sāo Joāo, she says the song is a call for sexual liberation in a world where ""women are still seen as submissive"".
Female funk performers and their messages bring new life to the subgenre ""coNSCientious funk"", says Andressa Oliveira of Liga do Funk, a group in São Paulo that trains artists. It draws some of its energy from opposition to Brazil's president, Jair Bolsonaro, who has aggressively conservative views on social issues. MC Rebecca, who came out as bisexual on Twitter, wrapped herself in a rainbow flag in a music video. Women are listening. ONErpm, a company that represents artists in negotiations with digital platforms, looked at data from YouTube for around 130 funk channels. It found that women are now 49.5% of the audience, up from 32% in 2014.
Female stars are giving Brazilian funk global appeal. Larissa Machado, who calls herself Anitta, started out in a church choir, made her name in Rio's funk scene and now has 37m Instagram followers, many of them abroad. The video for ""Vai Malandra"" (roughly, ""Go Hustler""), which was filmed in a Rio favela, has been viewed 352m times on YouTube. Anitta refused to airbrush out the cellulite on her thighs, delighting women. ""Vai Malandra"" is the first Portuguese-language song to reach Spotify's Global Top 50 list. That brought a singing gig with Madonna.
Kamilla Fialho, whose marketing company, K2L, helped shape Anitta's early career, compares her success to that of Beyoncé and Rihanna, who are politically active and flaunt their sexual empowerment. Her company is now coaching MC Rebecca by providing English lessons, among other things. Ms Fialho is not encouraging the young funkeira to stay away from the subject of sex. ""If you want polite music, listen to classical,"" she says.",140,Brazil,ctb-140-2,,False,,0,True

Democracy is at risk in Latin America. The danger goes well beyond Cuba, Nicaragua and Venezuela
DONALD TRUMP'S administration is not famed for its adherence to highfalutin' political principle, so John Bolton, the United States national security adviser, struck an unusual note when he claimed in a speech in Miami last month that the ""Monroe doctrine is alive and well"". The reference to the 19th-century principle under which the United States arrogated to itself the right to police Latin America was taken as a warning to Russia and China not to meddle in what used to be called ""America's backyard"". Mr Bolton gave new life to the doctrine by announcing fresh economic sanctions against Cuba, Nicaragua and Venezuela, which he likes to call the ""troika of tyranny"".
But the tone of his speech was optimistic as well as threatening. Once the troika was brought down, Mr Bolton explained, there was a prospect of ""the first free hemisphere in human history"" extending from ""the snowcapped Canadian Rockies to the glistening Strait of Magellan"".
The problem with Mr Bolton's soaring rhetoric is not just that the Strait of Magellan roils more than it glistens. It is also that both his analysis and his prescription are wrong. The weaknesses in Latin American democracy stretch far wider than the trio Mr Bolton fingered, and the United States will not help strengthen it by bullying its southern neighbours.
In the 1980s Latin America turned from a land of dictators and juntas into the world's third great region of democracy, along with Europe and North America. Since then democracy has put down roots. Most Latin Americans today enjoy more rights and freedoms than ever before.
Yet many Latin Americans have become discontented with their democracies (see Briefing). The region's economy is stagnant. Poverty is more widespread than it need be because of extreme inequality. Governments are not providing their citizens with security in the face of rising violent crime. Corruption is widespread. Voters' discontent, voiced on social media, has helped promote leaders with an unhealthy tendency to undermine democratic institutions.
Latin America's fall from grace is most obvious in Venezuela and Nicaragua, which are sliding into dictatorship; in communist Cuba, which stands behind those two regimes, hopes of reform have been dashed. But across the continent, the threats to democracy are growing.
Many Latin American voters have abandoned moderates in favour of populists. Brazil's Jair Bolsonaro and Mexico's Andrés Manuel López Obrador (known as AMLO) share an ambivalence to the dispersal of power and the toleration of opponents that are the essence of democracy. Mr Bolsonaro, who has spoken of his nostalgia for military rule, has eight generals in his cabinet of 22; AMLO is weakening competing centres of power, such as elected state governors. The ""northern triangle"" of Central America, meanwhile, is dominated by weak and corrupt governments. In Honduras a conservative president and American ally, Juan Orlando Hernández, governs thanks to an election marred by fraud. Guatemala's president ordered out a UN body investigating corruption that had helped jail two of his predecessors.
Voters elect populists such as Mr Bolsonaro and AMLO-and may elect Cristina Kirchner, who is on track to make a comeback in Argentina's election in October-not to replace democracy with dictatorship, but because they want their politicians to do a better job. Yet in the 21st century, it is not tanks on the streets that crush democracy. Rather, elected autocrats boil the frog, capturing courts, cowing the media and weakening the parts of civil society that hold them to account. By the time citizens squeal, it is too late. That is what happened in Venezuela under Hugo Chávez, and what is happening now in Turkey (see next leader).
The main task of averting the danger falls to Latin Americans. They need to rid politics of corruption and cronyism. Politicians need to keep their distance from the armed forces and their hands off the institutions that scrutinise the government. Above all, politicians need to reconnect with ordinary citizens. There are a few hopeful signs. New parties and NGOs are training young activists in how to be effective reformers.
The United States needs to help rather than hinder the task of strengthening democracy. Talk of the Monroe doctrine may make some Latin Americans see their northern neighbour more as a bully than as an ally. Instead of threatening to supplement sanctions on Venezuela with military action, it should work harder at combining sanctions with negotiations, especially with the armed forces. And Donald Trump should restore the $5oom aid programme for the northern triangle that he abruptly cancelled this year, for there were signs that it was helping to cut both violent crime and immigration.
Although Latin America usually gets little attention in American foreign policy, few other parts of the world have a bigger bearing-through immigration, drugs, trade and culture-on daily life in the United States. A democratic and prosperous Latin America matters on both sides of the Rio Grande. Mr Trump needs to think harder about how to help that happen.","Latin America

Four decades after dictatorships began to give way to democracy, populism and polarisation pose unprecedented threats
IT WAS ONE of the greatest waves of democratisation ever. In 1977 all but three of the 20 countries in Latin America were dictatorships of one kind or another. By 1990 only Mexico's civilian one-party state and communist Cuba survived. Several things lay behind the rise of democracy in the region. One was the waning of the cold war. Another was the economic failure of most of the dictators. And democracy was contagious. One country after another in Latin America put down democratic roots as power changed hands between right and left through free elections.
The outlook is suddenly much darker. Nicolás Maduro in Venezuela, like Daniel Ortega in Nicaragua, is an originally elected autocrat ruling as a dictator. He clings to power with the support of Cuba at the cost of wrecking his country and destabilising its neighbours. At least 3.7m Venezuelans have fled economic collapse and repression; organised crime and Colombian guerrillas flourish there. The repressive family despotism into which Nicaragua has degenerated under Mr Ortega and his wife, Rosario Murillo, is almost as nasty.
These autocratic extremes would be less worrying were not elections across the region showing that there are clear signs of disenchantment with democracy elsewhere. Election rules are sometimes flouted and independent institutions undermined. Many voters are turning to populists with little commitment to restraints on power. Parties of the moderate centre are weakening or collapsing.
Immoderate urges
An election marked by fraud in Honduras saw Juan Orlando Hernández, the conservative president, win a constitutionally dubious second term in 2017. In Guatemala, which will hold elections in June, the president recently ordered out a UN investigative body into organised crime and corruption which had helped to jail two of his predecessors. Evo Morales, a leftist who has been Bolivia's president since 2006, will seek a fourth term in October-also on dodgy constitutional grounds. In the same month, Cristina Fernández de Kirchner, a populist former president of Argentina who abused institutions in partisan fashion and faces corruption charges, stands a chance of being returned to office.
And then there are Latin America's two giants, Brazil and Mexico. Both have elected presidents who share a populist disregard for the norms, checks and balances, and toleration of critics that are necessary for lasting democracy.
The threat is more obvious in Brazil. Jair Bolsonaro, an army captain turned farright politician, took over on January 1st. A seven-term congressman, Mr Bolsonaro is a political insider in Brazil but one nostalgic for military rule. Eight generals sit in his 22-strong cabinet and scores more officers occupy second- and third-tier posts. ""Democracy and freedom only exist when the armed forces want them to,"" he said in a speech in March at a military ceremony. This will be news to Costa Rica. Its decision to abolish its army in 1948 is widely regarded as having helped it stay free. He even ordered the armed forces to commemorate a military coup in 1964, which he calls a revolution. Evidence is emerging that appears to show ties between Mr Bolsonaro's family and paramilitary militias that operate in the favelas of Rio de Janeiro.
Andrés Manuel López Obrador, a veteran populist of the left known as AMLO, has struck a more moderate tone is his first five months in office. Mexicans overwhelmingly approve of his promises to sweep away corruption and crime, as well as his modest way of life (he sits in economy on commercial flights around the country). But there are warning signs.
AMLO is not a fan of independent centres of power. He has named his own ""coordinators"" to supervise elected state governors, cut the salaries of judges and civil servants, named ill-qualified allies to regulatory bodies, and stopped giving public funds to NGOs. He has also shown deference to the armed forces, placing them in charge of a new National Guard, a paramilitary police force, despite the objection of the Senate. A proposed bill to pack the Supreme Court would end its independence. In March the tax agency threatened the owner of Reforma, a critical newspaper, with a tax investigation over the seemingly trivial matter of owing 12,000 pesos (around $630) from 2015.
These steps, though some are small-scale, all come from the populist handbook of disqualifying and intimidating opponents, building a political clientele and what Steven Levitsky and Daniel Ziblatt of Harvard University have called ""capturing the referees"" of democracy. The measures also hint at a return to what Enrique Krauze, a historian, calls Mexico's ""imperial presidency"" of past one-party rule.
Not all of the region is under threat. Chile and Uruguay, among others, still enjoy stable democracy, and most governments remain committed to that goal. The region's people are not so sure. In 2018 Latinobarómetro, a multi-country poll, found that only 48% of respondents saw themselves as convinced democrats, down from 61% in 2010. Just 24% pronounced themselves satisfied with democracy in their country, down from 44% in 2010 (see chart 1). How did democracy fall into such disrepute? How great is the threat to it? And how can democrats fight back?
The warning signs were clear. Take Eldorado, a sprawling suburb of São Paulo. In Brazil's boom of 2005-13 it had hopes of becoming solidly middle class. A year ago, as the country's election campaign got under way, people in Eldorado were fed up with rising crime, unemployment and a sense of official neglect. ""When we go out we don't know whether we will return alive,"" lamented Cleber Souza, the president of Sitio Joaninha, a former favela. In what had been a stronghold of the left-wing Workers' Party (pt), several people said they would consider voting for Mr Bolsonaro. ""He's a cry for justice from the society,"" said Anderson Carignano, the owner of a large DIY shop. ""People want a return to order.""
Behind the discontent lies a toxic cocktail of crime, corruption, poor public services and economic stagnation. With only 8% of the world's population, Latin America suffers a third of its murders. In many countries, the rule of law remains weak.
In the 1980s, many of the new democratic governments inherited economies bankrupted by debt-financed statist protectionism. The adoption of market reforms known as the ""Washington consensus"" provided a modest boost to growth. The democratic governments gradually expanded social provision. After the turn of the century many economies benefited from a surge in exports of minerals, oil and foodstuffs thanks to the vast demand from China. Poverty fell dramatically, while income inequality declined steadily.
Carnival's over
The end of the commodity boom has brought a sharp correction. Taken as a whole, the region's economies expanded at an average annual rate of 4.1% between 2003 and 2012; since 2013 that figure has shrunk to only 1%, taking income per head with it (see chart 2). Some countries, mainly on the Pacific seaboard, have done better. Others have done much worse. Brazil is barely recovering from a deep recession in 2015-16; Argentina is stuck in a long-term pattern of economic stop-go. Mexico has grown by only 2% annually for decades.
The underlying causes include low productivity, rigid regulation, a lack of incentives for small companies to expand or become more efficient, and corrupt political structures benefiting from the status quo. For a time an expanding labour force saw the region grow despite the problems. That demographic bonus is now mostly spent. In many countries the working-age population will start shrinking in the 2020s. As economies have faltered poverty has edged up and the decline in income inequality has slowed. This has exacerbated an existing crisis of political representation.
Against this bleak landscape, the worldwide ills of democracy have taken an acute form in Latin America. ""There's a kind of repudiation of the whole political class,"" says Fernando Henrique Cardoso, a sociologist and former Brazilian president. Political structures ""don't correspond any more to the moment societies are living in,"" he adds. That is partly a result of the digitalcommunications revolution in which social media have bypassed intermediaries. Political traditions also play a role.
Latin America has a long history of caudillos and populists, sometimes embodied in the same person, such as Argentina's Juan Perón. The strongman tradition stemmed from long and bloody wars of independence two centuries ago, and from the difficulties of governing large territories, often with challenging terrains and ethnically diverse populations. Many countries were rich in natural resources. Latin American societies, partly because of the legacies of colonialism and slavery, were long scarred by extreme income inequality. That combination of natural wealth and inequality bred resentments that populists exploited.
But there is another political tradition in the region, one of middle-class democratic reformism, honed in the long struggle to turn the constitutionalism present at the birth of Latin American republics into a lasting reality. In various guises, this political current was in the ascendant in many countries for much of the past 40 years. Now the integrity and competence of the politicians that embodied it have been called into question.
Voters abandoned such dominant parties as Brazil's pt and Mexico's Institutional Revolutionary Party because ""they were hypocritical in talking of the public interest while being inward-looking, self-serving and corrupt,"" says Laurence Whitehead of Oxford University.
Corruption usually diminishes as countries get richer. Yet Latin American politics seem, for a mainly middle-income region, unusually grubby. The region's states are marked by heavy-handed regulatory overkill mixed, in practice, with wide discretionary power for officials. The commodity boom meant more resources flowing into state coffers, and thus more money for politicians to steal.
The investigation known as Lava Jato (car wash), originating in Brazil into bribery by Odebrecht and other construction companies across Latin America, has exposed the scale of the corruption to the public, leading to a widespread perception that the region's entire political class is corrupt. In fact the investigations are a sign of overdue change. The traditional impunity of the powerful in Latin America has been challenged by independent judiciaries and investigative journalism, both a product of democracy. Brazil has seen scores of politicians convicted on charges of corruption. In Peru four former presidents have been under investigation. One of them, Alan Garcia, committed suicide last month as police arrived at his house in Lima to jail him for alleged corruption.
Off-centre
Ironically, populists have been relatively untouched by scandal, either because they control the judiciary and the media or because a halo of the saviour of the people surrounds them. It is often centrist parties that pay the political price. That is partly because they have struggled to practise good government. The reformist zeal of the early years of the democratic wave has fallen victim to two recent tendencies in politics: fragmentation and polarisation.
Brazil's new Congress contains 30 parties, up from five in 1982. The 130 seats in Peru's single-chamber parliament are divided among 11 groupings. In Colombia's parliament, once dominated by Liberals and Conservatives, there are now 16 parties. Even Chile's stable system is starting to splinter. One reason is Latin America's unique-and awkward-combination of directly elected presidencies and legislatures chosen by proportional representation. Party switching carries a low cost.
In some countries politics has become a way of making money, or a brazen means to promote private business interests. In Peru, for example, such interests often buy their way into parties, undermining party solidity and the representative character of the country's democracy, according to Alberto Vergara, a political scientist at Lima's Pacifico University.
Another factor is that the old left-right divide is no longer the only cleavage. Evangelical conservatives are pushing back against liberal secularism on issues such as abortion and gay rights. In Costa Rica, which had a two-party system until the turn of the century, an evangelical Christian gospel singer of little previous political experience made it to a run-off presidential election last year (though he lost). As a consequence of fragmentation, governments often lack the majorities required to push through unpopular but necessary reforms.
Recent elections have seen a swing to the right in South America and to the left in Mexico and Central America. In both cases that has involved the alternation of power that is normal in democracies. But the switch has been accompanied by extreme political polarisation. That has been both cause and consequence of the collapse of the moderate reformist centre. And it risks making politics more unstable.
Yet there are some grounds for optimism. Latin American democracy is more resilient than outward appearances might suggest. Opinion polls suggest that only around a fifth to a quarter of Latin Americans might welcome authoritarian government. In some countries checks and balances provide safeguards. In Brazil, for example, Mr Bolsonaro's government is a ramshackle assortment of generals, economic liberals and social conservatives. ""Bolsonaro isn't a party, he isn't anything, he's a momentary mood,"" thinks Mr Cardoso, who trusts in the countervailing strength of the legislature, a free media and social organisations. ""You have to be forever vigilant but I don't think the institutions here are going to embark on an authoritarian line.""
In Mexico, where opposition to AMLO is weak and checks and balances on executive power are only incipient, there may be greater cause for concern. But the president's popularity may decline as the economy weakens. And the centre is not dead everywhere.
Amid the dust from the collapse of old party systems, there are glimpses of democratic renewal, led by a new generation of activists. There's ""an ecosystem of new politics in Brazil,"" explains Eduardo Mufarej, an investment banker who has set up Renova, a privately funded foundation to train young democratic leaders in politics, ethics and policy. In the 2018 elections, 120 of Renova's graduates ran (for 22 different parties). Ten were elected to the federal Congress and seven to state legislatures. They are trying to convince the public that not all politicians are self-serving.
One was Tabata Amaral, a 25-year-old activist for better public education elected as a federal deputy for São Paulo. She mobilised 5,000 volunteers through social media; her campaign cost 1.25m reais ($320,000), raised through individual donations. To cut costs, she has teamed up with two other Renova graduates (in different parties) to share congressional staff. Her first brush with the old order was to find that the apartment assigned to her in Brasilia by the Congress was illegally occupied by the son of a long-standing legislator, who refused to move.
Julio Guzmán tried to run for president in Peru in 2016. He was thwarted when the electoral authority barred his candidacy on a technicality. He has spent the time since travelling round the country building a new centrist party. He insists that he is engaged in ""a different way of doing politics"" in which all members are scrutinised and donations will be made public. His Morado party is aimed at ""the new Peruvian, who looks to the future, is entrepreneurial and from the emerging middle classes"".
Poles apart
Polarisation in Colombia's election last year led to a run-off between Iván Duque, the conservative victor, and Gustavo Petro, a leftist who until recently was a fan of Venezuela's Hugo Chávez. But there, too, is a demand for a new politics, thinks Claudia López, the vice-presidential candidate of the centrist Green Party (which narrowly failed to make the run-off). The task, she says, is to restore the trust of citizens in politicians. That partly involves competing in the emotional terrain occupied by populists. But it also means a different approach. ""Nobody is interested in being a member of a hierarchical political organisation anymore,"" she says. ""Those of us in parties have to adapt to citizen causes or we're dead.""
These are green shoots in a forest of dead wood. But they are a sign of the dynamism of Latin American societies-democracy's greatest asset. Latin America remains the third most-democratic region in the world according to the Democracy Index compiled by the Economist Intelligence Unit. The past four decades have created a culture of citizen rights and political participation. But democracy's defences in Latin America are relatively frail, as Venezuela shows. All the evidence is that citizens want a new political order, in which politicians are more concerned with public services, security and the rule of law rather than lining their pockets. And they want it now.","BRASILIA AND LIMA 
 Four decades after dictatorships began to give way to democracy , populism and polarisation pose unprecedented threats 
 IT WAS ONE of the greatest waves of democratisation ever . In 1977 all but three of the 20 countries in Latin America were dictatorships of one kind or another . By 1990 only Mexico 's civilian one - party state and communist Cuba survived . Several things lay behind the rise of democracy in the region . One was the waning of the cold war . Another was the economic failure of most of the dictators . And democracy was contagious . One country after another in Latin America put down democratic roots as power changed hands between right and left through free elections . 
 The outlook is suddenly much darker . Nicolás Maduro in Venezuela , like Daniel Ortega in Nicaragua , is an originally elected autocrat ruling as a dictator . He clings to power with the support of Cuba at the cost of wrecking his country and destabilising its neighbours . At least 3.7 m Venezuelans have fled economic collapse and repression ; organised crime and Colombian guerrillas flourish there . The repressive family despotism into which Nicaragua has degenerated under Mr Ortega and his wife , Rosario Murillo , is almost as nasty . 
 These autocratic extremes would be less worrying were not elections across the region showing that there are clear signs of disenchantment with democracy elsewhere . Election rules are sometimes flouted and independent institutions undermined . Many voters are turning to populists with little commitment to restraints on power . Parties of the moderate centre are weakening or collapsing . 
 Immoderate urges 
 An election marked by fraud in Honduras saw Juan Orlando Hernández , the conservative president , win a constitutionally dubious second term in 2017 . In Guatemala , which will hold elections in June , the president recently ordered out a UN investigative body into organised crime and corruption which had helped to jail two of his predecessors . Evo Morales , a leftist who has been Bolivia 's president since 2006 , will seek a fourth term in October - also on dodgy constitutional grounds . In the same month , Cristina Fernández de Kirchner , a populist former president of Argentina who abused institutions in partisan fashion and faces corruption charges , stands a chance of being returned to office . 
 And then there are Latin America 's two giants , Brazil and Mexico . Both have elected presidents who share a populist disregard for the norms , checks and balances , and toleration of critics that are necessary for lasting democracy . 
 The threat is more obvious in Brazil . Jair Bolsonaro took over on January 1st . A seven - term congressman , Mr Bolsonaro is a political insider in Brazil but one nostalgic for military rule . Eight generals sit in Jair Bolsonaro's 22 - strong cabinet and scores more officers occupy second- and third - tier posts . "" Democracy and freedom only exist when the armed forces want them to , "" Jair Bolsonaro said in a speech in March at a military ceremony . This will be news to Costa Rica . Its decision to abolish its army in 1948 is widely regarded as having helped it stay free . Jair Bolsonaro even ordered the armed forces to commemorate a military coup in 1964 , which Jair Bolsonaro calls a revolution . Evidence is emerging that appears to show ties between Jair Bolsonaro's family and paramilitary militias that operate in the favelas of Rio de Janeiro . 
 Andrés Manuel López Obrador , a veteran populist of the left known as AMLO , has struck a more moderate tone is his first five months in office . Mexicans overwhelmingly approve of his promises to sweep away corruption and crime , as well as his modest way of life ( he sits in economy on commercial flights around the country ) . But there are warning signs . 
 AMLO is not a fan of independent centres of power . He has named his own "" coordinators "" to supervise elected state governors , cut the salaries of judges and civil servants , named ill - qualified allies to regulatory bodies , and stopped giving public funds to NGOs . He has also shown deference to the armed forces , placing them in charge of a new National Guard , a paramilitary police force , despite the objection of the Senate . A proposed bill to pack the Supreme Court would end its independence . In March the tax agency threatened the owner of Reforma , a critical newspaper , with a tax investigation over the seemingly trivial matter of owing 12,000 pesos ( around $ 630 ) from 2015 . 
 These steps , though some are small - scale , all come from the populist handbook of disqualifying and intimidating opponents , building a political clientele and what Steven Levitsky and Daniel Ziblatt of Harvard University have called "" capturing the referees "" of democracy . The measures also hint at a return to what Enrique Krauze , a historian , calls Mexico 's "" imperial presidency "" of past one - party rule . 
 Not all of the region is under threat . Chile and Uruguay , among others , still enjoy stable democracy , and most governments remain committed to that goal . The region 's people are not so sure . In 2018 Latinobarómetro , a multi - country poll , found that only 48 % of respondents saw themselves as convinced democrats , down from 61 % in 2010 . Just 24 % pronounced themselves satisfied with democracy in their country , down from 44 % in 2010 ( see chart 1 ) . How did democracy fall into such disrepute ? How great is the threat to it ? And how can democrats fight back ? 
 The warning signs were clear . Take Eldorado , a sprawling suburb of São Paulo . In Brazil 's boom of 2005 - 13 it had hopes of becoming solidly middle class . A year ago , as the country 's election campaign got under way , people in Eldorado were fed up with rising crime , unemployment and a sense of official neglect . "" When we go out we do n't know whether we will return alive , "" lamented Cleber Souza , the president of Sitio Joaninha , a former favela . In what had been a stronghold of the left - wing Workers ' Party ( pt ) , several people said they would consider voting for Jair Bolsonaro . "" Jair Bolsonaro 's a cry for justice from the society , "" said Anderson Carignano , the owner of a large DIY shop . "" People want a return to order . "" 
 Behind the discontent lies a toxic cocktail of crime , corruption , poor public services and economic stagnation . With only 8 % of the world 's population , Latin America suffers a third of its murders . In many countries , the rule of law remains weak . 
 In the 1980s , many of the new democratic governments inherited economies bankrupted by debt - financed statist protectionism . The adoption of market reforms known as the "" Washington consensus "" provided a modest boost to growth . The democratic governments gradually expanded social provision . After the turn of the century many economies benefited from a surge in exports of minerals , oil and foodstuffs thanks to the vast demand from China . Poverty fell dramatically , while income inequality declined steadily . 
 Carnival 's over 
 The end of the commodity boom has brought a sharp correction . Taken as a whole , the region 's economies expanded at an average annual rate of 4.1 % between 2003 and 2012 ; since 2013 that figure has shrunk to only 1 % , taking income per head with it ( see chart 2 ) . Some countries , mainly on the Pacific seaboard , have done better . Others have done much worse . Brazil is barely recovering from a deep recession in 2015 - 16 ; Argentina is stuck in a long - term pattern of economic stop - go . Mexico has grown by only 2 % annually for decades . 
 The underlying causes include low productivity , rigid regulation , a lack of incentives for small companies to expand or become more efficient , and corrupt political structures benefiting from the status quo . For a time an expanding labour force saw the region grow despite the problems . That demographic bonus is now mostly spent . In many countries the working - age population will start shrinking in the 2020s . As economies have faltered poverty has edged up and the decline in income inequality has slowed . This has exacerbated an existing crisis of political representation . 
 Against this bleak landscape , the worldwide ills of democracy have taken an acute form in Latin America . "" There 's a kind of repudiation of the whole political class , "" says Fernando Henrique Cardoso , a sociologist and former Brazilian president . Political structures "" do n't correspond any more to the moment societies are living in , "" he adds . That is partly a result of the digitalcommunications revolution in which social media have bypassed intermediaries . Political traditions also play a role . 
 Latin America has a long history of caudillos and populists , sometimes embodied in the same person , such as Argentina 's Juan Perón . The strongman tradition stemmed from long and bloody wars of independence two centuries ago , and from the difficulties of governing large territories , often with challenging terrains and ethnically diverse populations . Many countries were rich in natural resources . Latin American societies , partly because of the legacies of colonialism and slavery , were long scarred by extreme income inequality . That combination of natural wealth and inequality bred resentments that populists exploited . 
 But there is another political tradition in the region , one of middle - class democratic reformism , honed in the long struggle to turn the constitutionalism present at the birth of Latin American republics into a lasting reality . In various guises , this political current was in the ascendant in many countries for much of the past 40 years . Now the integrity and competence of the politicians that embodied it have been called into question . 
 Voters abandoned such dominant parties as Brazil 's pt and Mexico 's Institutional Revolutionary Party because "" they were hypocritical in talking of the public interest while being inward - looking , self - serving and corrupt , "" says Laurence Whitehead of Oxford University . 
 Corruption usually diminishes as countries get richer . Yet Latin American politics seem , for a mainly middle - income region , unusually grubby . The region 's states are marked by heavy - handed regulatory overkill mixed , in practice , with wide discretionary power for officials . The commodity boom meant more resources flowing into state coffers , and thus more money for politicians to steal . 
 The investigation known as Lava Jato ( car wash ) , originating in Brazil into bribery by Odebrecht and other construction companies across Latin America , has exposed the scale of the corruption to the public , leading to a widespread perception that the region 's entire political class is corrupt . In fact the investigations are a sign of overdue change . The traditional impunity of the powerful in Latin America has been challenged by independent judiciaries and investigative journalism , both a product of democracy . Brazil has seen scores of politicians convicted on charges of corruption . In Peru four former presidents have been under investigation . One of them , Alan Garcia , committed suicide last month as police arrived at his house in Lima to jail him for alleged corruption . 
 Off - centre 
 Ironically , populists have been relatively untouched by scandal , either because they control the judiciary and the media or because a halo of the saviour of the people surrounds them . It is often centrist parties that pay the political price . That is partly because they have struggled to practise good government . The reformist zeal of the early years of the democratic wave has fallen victim to two recent tendencies in politics : fragmentation and polarisation . 
 Brazil 's new Congress contains 30 parties , up from five in 1982 . The 130 seats in Peru 's single - chamber parliament are divided among 11 groupings . In Colombia 's parliament , once dominated by Liberals and Conservatives , there are now 16 parties . Even Chile 's stable system is starting to splinter . One reason is Latin America 's unique - and awkward - combination of directly elected presidencies and legislatures chosen by proportional representation . Party switching carries a low cost .

In Peru , for example , such interests often buy their way into parties , undermining party solidity and the representative character of the country 's democracy , according to Alberto Vergara , a political scientist at Lima 's Pacifico University .

The loser, Prabowo Subianto, has refused to accept the result of April's ballot, alleging widespread fraud. That claim has brought his supporters out on the streets, though independent observers have said the election was free and fair.

Trials and tribulations
Cristina Fernández de Kirchner surprised pundits in Argentina by announcing that she would run for vice-president on a ticket headed by Alberto Fernández, her former chief of staff (and no relation). Ms Fernández, a spendthrift former president, had been widely expected to run for the presidency again, a prospect that frightened investors. She went on trial this week accused of taking bribes for government contracts when in power. She denies the claims.
Fourteen governors in Brazil wrote a letter asking Jair Bolsonaro, the president, to retract a decree he signed this month that would make it easier for people to carry guns in public. In a partial nod to critics, Mr Bolsonaro banned the carrying of assault weapons.

May's autumn
Theresa May's grip on power looked increasingly shaky, as even her erstwhile supporters abandoned her and her rivals in the Tory party sought to oust her. The catalyst was the British prime minister's attempt to rejig Britain's eu withdrawal bill. Mrs May set out changes, including new guarantees on workers' rights, and promised Parliament that if it passed her * bill she would allow mps a vote on whether to hold a second referendum. But that pleased no one.

A video had surfaced, apparently showing Mr Strache discussing the exchange of public contracts for favourable media coverage with a woman who claimed to be the niece of a Russian oligarch. Austria's chancellor, Sebastian Kurz, said he would call early elections.

MEXICO CITY AND SĀO PAULO
Latin America is awash with guns, many from the United States
Like a criminal and his fingerprints, every gun leaves its mark on the ammunition it uses. Such traces are what Sergio Sandoval de la Peña pores over daily in Mexico City's ballistics lab. A series of darkgreen circles, like the sub-woofer of a speaker, appear on his computer screen. It is a digitised three-dimensional model of a cartridge, found at the scene of a robbery this year and placed under a microscope. Checking the marks against hundreds of thousands of potential matches, Mr de la Peña concludes that the gun that ejected it was also used in a murder last year.
The ballistics technology employed to work such wonders comes courtesy of the United States. Alas, so does the gun, according to Mr de la Peña's database. A study of weapons found at crime scenes suggests that 70% of gun crimes in Mexico involve American-bought weapons. The share of homicides in Mexico involving a firearm grew from 16% in 1997 to 66% in 2017. That suggests around half of Mexico's 33,000 murder victims last year were killed by a gun manufactured in the United States, which had 14,542 gun homicides in 2017. An American-made gun is more likely to be used in a murder in Mexico than at home.
Mexico is far from alone. Across Latin America, the share of murders involving guns is creeping upwards. Many countries already beset by organised crime and weak states have their troubles compounded by their proximity to America, the country with the rich world's most permissive gun laws. Changes signed by President Donald Trump may only worsen the situation.
Guns and doses
Most guns enter Mexico after being legally bought in the United States. Criminal groups typically use associates to buy them, smuggling guns in the opposite direction to drugs. Beyond Mexico, American guns often arrive through ports from Florida, hidden among other imported goods. In Honduras, where half of all unregistered weapons come from America, smugglers have been known to wrap guns in foil and submerge them in paint to avoid detection from x-ray machines. Less creative, bigger groups simply pay off customs officers.
Does the availability of American guns boost murder rates? The expiration in 2004 of an assault-weapons ban in the United States provided a real-world experiment. A study found that in Mexican municipalities bordering Arizona, New Mexico and Texas, where the guns were put back on sale, the murder rate shot up soon after. Murder rates adjacent to California, which maintained a ban, stayed flat.
But even in the unlikely event that the United States were to repeal the second amendment, Latin America's gun problem would not abate. Many national armies and police forces have a habit of losing their weapons. In Guerrero, a state in Mexico, one weapon in five belonging to the state police ends up ""lost or stolen"". Central American police forces are notorious for selling seized weapons they should destroy, says Mark Ungar of Brooklyn College.
In Honduras the profits from gun sales to private individuals, over which the army has a monopoly, are the second-biggest contributor to soldiers' pensions. Many American weapons used in crime in Brazil are trafficked through Paraguay, which has loose gun controls. Between 2013 and mid-2018 Paraguayan companies legally imported 648,000 guns and 331m rounds of ammunition, a large share from the United States. Last year America briefly banned commercial arms sales to Paraguay to reduce the smuggling, prompting the country to impose its own controls.
Jair Bolsonaro, Brazil's president, has signed two decrees this year making it easier for Brazilians to own and carry guns. Shares of Brazil's large gun firms have soared. Mr Bolsonaro has said he will legalise imports of American guns too. Legal weapons can become illegal ones with ease through theft or corruption, observes An Vranckx of Catalystas, a consultancy. Bra- zil's murder rate dipped after 2003 when new rules made it harder to buy a gun.
One place American guns are turning up less is Venezuela, largely because there is a ban on their export there. A ready supply of weapons from elsewhere has helped push the country's murder rate to the world's highest. Lately the economic crisis may have stemmed the flow: the import of weapons, like all other imports, has probably dropped. A decline in productivity at the state-owned factories which make bullets may explain why the murder rate has slipped back of late.
What can be done to stop the flow of weapons? One idea floated in Mexico was to ban American steel firms and other businesses that supply gun manufacturers from Mexican government contracts, and to make workers from any firms that sell guns apply for visas if they want to visit Mexico. But that idea lost steam when Mr Trump became president. Indeed since his election things have got worse. In January Mr Trump said responsibility for approving arms exports would shift from the State Department to the Department of Commerce, which applies looser rules.
So Latin American countries will have to do more themselves. National, interlinked databases of registered weapons can help police keep hold of their guns. Purging the dirtiest cops, as Colombia has done, helps to keep weapons out of criminal hands. Rather than waiting for the United States, Latin America will have to place its own institutions under the microscope. ?","Guns in Latin America

RIO DE JANEIRO
For some in Brazil, remembering slavery is vital; others are wary of a painful past
In 2005 Giovanni Harvey began to buy property in the port district of Rio de Janeiro. The area was dilapidated and controlled by drug-traffickers; he would wear a tucked-in shirt (to show he was unarmed) and sandals (suggesting he had no reason to run). But Rio aspired to host the World Cup and the Olympics, and the area was due to be gentrified. To Mr Harvey, a successful black businessman who founded Brazil's first incubator for Afro-Brazilian entrepreneurs and served as national secretary for racial equality, the purchase was ""purely an investment"". He knew nothing about the port's role in slavery.
Two events in February 2011 changed that. On a business trip to Senegal he visited the Maison des Esclaves, where enslaved Africans were loaded onto ships for the Americas. ""Until then, I'd had a romantic image of slavery,"" he says. In the 1970s his school had glossed over such dehumanising aspects as family separation. In Africa, he wept. Just days after returning to Brazil, he turned on the television and saw an archaeologist discussing the ""discovery"" of the Cais do Valongo, a wharf in Rio where around im slaves had disembarked (pictured). It was two blocks from his house.
Since then, Mr Harvey and a small group of Rio-based academics, entrepreneurs and activists have fought to disseminate this history. It is an uphill battle. The wharf was recognised as a unesco World Heritage site in 2017, but risks losing that status because of political bickering, economic woe and the government's perennial negligence over historical preservation, especially when the history in question is painful. A plan to construct a museum next to the wharf has won international support, but attracted neither funding nor powerful domestic politicians to tout it.
These days the wharf is ridden with graffiti and trash. Other relevant sites are in even sorrier states-but then, so is much of Rio. For some, commemorating slavery is a vital part of addressing contemporary injustices. For others, it is a distraction.
Beyond samba
Between 1525 and 1866 more than 12m slaves were shipped across the Atlantic to European colonies in the Americas. Around half a million died on the way to Brazil; of the 4.9m who disembarked there, around half did so in Rio, according to Emory University's Transatlantic Slave Trade Database (see chart on next page). At the height of the slave trade in the early 1800s, when gold, coffee and sugar cane were booming, 400-500 enslaved Africans landed at the Valongo wharf every week, says Monica Lima of the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro. Its unearthing in 2011was not really a discovery, she notes. Documentary evidence had always existed, but over the years the wharf was covered up-by a new pier to receive the Portuguese empress in 1843; by a commercial plaza in the early 1900s; by a powerful myth, confected in the 1930s, that Brazil is a ""racial democracy"".
""There's this notion that Brazil isn't as racist because it has lots of interracial marriages and everyone loves samba,"" says Ms Lima. Though Brazil was late to outlaw slavery, in 1888, it did not adopt the segregation and miscegenation laws that ensued in America. More fluid relations helped perpetuate a feeling that slavery need not be dwelled upon. Mr Harvey sees himself as a victim of this ""social amnesia"".
In the 1970s Brazil's civil-rights movement started to question the idea of racial equality. It gradually brought about change. During the presidency of Luiz Inácio ""Lula"" da Silva (2003-10), a law instructed schools to teach Afro-Brazilian history. Steps were taken to boost black education and alleviate poverty; descendants of escaped slaves living on informal settlements called quilombos gained land rights. Sāo Paulo opened the Museu Afro Brasil, a complement to an existing institution in the north-eastern city of Salvador (though neither focuses on slavery).
In Rio, Eduardo Paes, a white mayor known for his love of samba, promised that a multi-billion-dollar project to renovate the port would benefit the black neigh- bourhoods around it. Rebranded with an old nickname, Little Africa, the area has witnessed a cultural flowering in recent years, including the Museu de Arte do Rio, which hosted Brazil's first major exhibit about samba, and the rebirth of a weekly gathering at Pedra do Sal, a rock where early sambistas jammed. Julio Barroso, a cultural impresario, says it is these sorts of initiatives that the government should support. ""We can't get stuck in the past,"" he says, ""we have to look toward the future.""
Others insist that the awful history of slavery must be remembered alongside uplifting narratives. ""It's more than just a reference point, it's the defining factor in the construction of Brazilian identity,"" thinks Ms Lima. Ignorance, they say, only makes this task more urgent. When vestiges of the Valongo wharf began to emerge in 2011, Mayor Paes gleefully announced that Rio had found its ""Roman ruins"". Newly enlightened, Mr Harvey protested. ""This is our Maison des Esclaves,"" he said. More fumbling followed, including a short-lived suggestion that the mayor's office inaugurate the wharf with a musical re-enactment of a slave voyage, featuring black actors.
The unquiet dead
Because of such insensitivity, many black people in Rio are apprehensive about the museum proposal. The original plan was to use a warehouse near the wharf owned by the federal government and constructed in 1871 (without slave labour) by André Rebouças, a black engineer. The Smithsonian Institution and other overseas bodies were supportive, but the scheme came to nothing, as did a proposal in 2017 from Rio's new mayor, Marcelo Crivella, for a ""Museum of Slavery and Liberty"". Its unfortunate Portuguese acronym-mel, meaning honey- sparked an outcry.
The project was renamed and given the broader purpose of chronicling the African diaspora. Then, in February, Nilcemar Nogueira, the municipal official responsible, was demoted. She insists the plans are progressing; the 80m reais ($19.5m) required will come from private donations, she says. Meanwhile, rubbish collection at the wharf depends on a grant from America's State Department. ""If the mayor's office can't even take out the trash, how is it going to run a museum?"" asks Luiz Eduardo Negrogun of the State Council for Black Rights.
One danger is that debate over how to handle such a sensitive subject, which could be therapeutic, will instead be a pretext for uninterested governments to abandon the project altogether. Brazil's far-right president, Jair Bolsonaro, once characterised quilombo residents as fat and lazy. Mr Crivella (an evangelical Christian) is the first Rio mayor in decades to refuse to attend carnival celebrations. Choosing whether and how to highlight slavery is ""a political decision"", says Milton Guran, an anthropologist who co-ordinated the Valongo wharf's recognition by unesco.
Ali Moussa Iye, director of unesco's Slave Route Project, which has just issued guidelines on managing slavery-related sites, notes that the task is often complicated by the paucity of physical exhibits: ""apart from shackles here and there, it is an intangible heritage."" In Rio, though, even such artefacts as have survived have been neglected. Consider the ""New Blacks Cemeteries"", pitiful church-side plots where newly arrived slaves who died from disease or exhaustion were dumped like rubbish. In 1996 a white woman came across some such remains while building a house. Merced Guimarāes now runs a tiny museum called the ""Institute of New Blacks"", where visitors can peer through a glass panel in the floor and see the skeletons of slaves.
But there has been no effort to fund large-scale excavations or memorials. ""Archaeology in Brazil doesn't produce knowledge, it just accumulates material,"" says Joāo Carlos Nara, an architect and historian who studies the Santa Rita church in Rio, where thousands of slaves were buried in the mid-18th century. He thought the construction of a tram line on the site could be an opportunity to learn what lay beneath. But the city was keen to finish the job.
After some debate, the firm in charge proposed raising the tracks to avoid the bones, and to give several stations apposite names such as ""Little Africa"" and ""New Blacks"". Black leaders reluctantly agreed- to forestall a repetition of what happened to the material recovered from the Valongo wharf in 2011. Mr Negrogun summarises that bleak precedent: ""The remains of our ancestors are sitting in plastic bags in airconditioned shipping containers waiting for whenever there's enough money to study them."" Last year, construction on the tram line moved forward. Whatever bones had emerged were quickly covered up. ?","Commemorating slavery

""It's more than just a reference point, it's the defining factor in the construction of Brazilian identity,"" thinks Ms Lima. Ignorance, they say, only makes this task more urgent. When vestiges of the Valongo wharf began to emerge in 2011, Mayor Paes gleefully announced that Rio had found its ""Roman ruins"". Newly enlightened, Mr Harvey protested. ""This is our Maison des Esclaves,"" he said. More fumbling followed, including a short-lived suggestion that the mayor's office inaugurate the wharf with a musical re-enactment of a slave voyage, featuring black actors.
The unquiet dead
Because of such insensitivity, many black people in Rio are apprehensive about the museum proposal. The original plan was to use a warehouse near the wharf owned by the federal government and constructed in 1871 (without slave labour) by André Rebouças, a black engineer. The Smithsonian Institution and other overseas bodies were supportive, but the scheme came to nothing, as did a proposal in 2017 from Rio's new mayor, Marcelo Crivella, for a ""Museum of Slavery and Liberty"". Its unfortunate Portuguese acronym-mel, meaning honey- sparked an outcry.
The project was renamed and given the broader purpose of chronicling the African diaspora. Then, in February, Nilcemar Nogueira, the municipal official responsible, was demoted. She insists the plans are progressing; the 80m reais ($19.5m) required will come from private donations, she says. Meanwhile, rubbish collection at the wharf depends on a grant from America's State Department. ""If the mayor's office can't even take out the trash, how is it going to run a museum?"" asks Luiz Eduardo Negrogun of the State Council for Black Rights.
One danger is that debate over how to handle such a sensitive subject, which could be therapeutic, will instead be a pretext for uninterested governments to abandon the project altogether. Brazil's far-right president, Jair Bolsonaro, once characterised quilombo residents as fat and lazy. Mr Crivella (an evangelical Christian) is the first Rio mayor in decades to refuse to attend carnival celebrations. Choosing whether and how to highlight slavery is ""a political decision"", says Milton Guran, an anthropologist who co-ordinated the Valongo wharf's recognition by unesco.
Ali Moussa Iye, director of unesco's Slave Route Project, which has just issued guidelines on managing slavery-related sites, notes that the task is often complicated by the paucity of physical exhibits: ""apart from shackles here and there, it is an intangible heritage."" In Rio, though, even such artefacts as have survived have been neglected. Consider the ""New Blacks Cemeteries"", pitiful church-side plots where newly arrived slaves who died from disease or exhaustion were dumped like rubbish. In 1996 a white woman came across some such remains while building a house. Merced Guimarāes now runs a tiny museum called the ""Institute of New Blacks"", where visitors can peer through a glass panel in the floor and see the skeletons of slaves.
But there has been no effort to fund large-scale excavations or memorials. ""Archaeology in Brazil doesn't produce knowledge, it just accumulates material,"" says Joāo Carlos Nara, an architect and historian who studies the Santa Rita church in Rio, where thousands of slaves were buried in the mid-18th century. He thought the construction of a tram line on the site could be an opportunity to learn what lay beneath. But the city was keen to finish the job.
After some debate, the firm in charge proposed raising the tracks to avoid the bones, and to give several stations apposite names such as ""Little Africa"" and ""New Blacks"". Black leaders reluctantly agreed- to forestall a repetition of what happened to the material recovered from the Valongo wharf in 2011. Mr Negrogun summarises that bleak precedent: ""The remains of our ancestors are sitting in plastic bags in airconditioned shipping containers waiting for whenever there's enough money to study them."" Last year, construction on the tram line moved forward. Whatever bones had emerged were quickly covered up. ?",140,Brazil,ctb-140-2,,False,,0,True

You cannot defeat crime by tolerating militias
JAIR BOLSONARO, Brazil's president, was elected last year on a promise to rid his country of a trio of plagues: economic stagnation, corruption and sickening violence. For residents of Rio de Janeiro, the last of these is most urgent. The number of murders in Rio state reached 40 per 100,000 in 2017, 14 times the rate in New York state. The government felt compelled to send in the army, temporarily, to quell the mayhem. Much of the city and its favelas are controlled by organised criminals, who are difficult to prosecute because residents are terrified to testify against them. Mr Bolsonaro is well aware of this. He was a seven-term federal congressman for the state of Rio de Janeiro and has deep personal ties to the city. Yet his prescription for fighting crime in Rio and places like it is clueless (see Americas section).
Instead of bolstering the institutions of law and order so that they can restore calm and prosecute gang bosses, Mr Bolsonaro thinks the way to tackle violence is with more violence. He has allowed more Brazilians to own and carry guns, encouraging them to confront criminals themselves. He also wants to make it harder to punish police officers who kill suspects. Under one proposal, a judge could suspend a cop's sentence for homicide if he acted out of ""excusable fear, surprise or intense emotion"". Yet how many cops do not experience ""intense emotion"" just before shooting someone? Unsurprisingly, the number of shootings by police has soared. In the first four months of this year, officers in Rio state shot dead nearly five people a day. That is more than all the police in the United States typically kill, while policing a population 19 times larger.
Worse, Mr Bolsonaro has smiled on militias-paramilitary groups that are often run by current and retired police officers. These mafia-like organisations now, in effect, control a quarter of Rio's metropolitan area and hold sway over a little under a sixth of its population-some 2m people. They claim to offer protection from drug gangs, and to provide services to people who live in the areas they control. In fact, they run their patch like a medieval estate, extracting money from residents with the threat of violence. Far from suppressing drug gangs, they have in some places held auctions where gangs bid for the right to distribute their wares on militia turf.
Mr Bolsonaro has done nothing to stop the militias. He has argued, ludicrously, that they prevent violence. Until last year his eldest son, Flávio, now a federal senator from Rio, employed the wife and mother of a fugitive police officer accused of leading a militia called the ""Crime Office"". Two of its members are accused of the murder of an opposition city councilwoman. Polling suggests most residents fear the militias, perhaps even more than drug gangs. Politicians, however, find them useful. They share loot with political patrons, shepherd their supporters into polling stations and intimidate their opponents.
This should not need spelling out, but if Mr Bolsonaro wants to reduce crime, he should not allow police officers to run their own mafia. It is hard to foster respect for the law if cops can gun people down and run extortion rackets with impunity. It is also hard to instil in the cops themselves the necessary habits of patient detective work and the impartial gathering of evidence if they can close a case simply by pulling a trigger. Evidence from around the world shows that crime is lowest when the police are trusted; when officers come from the areas where they work, know the people who live there and are not seen as the enemy.
In the past, Rio had started to do a better job of curbing gang violence. Before the football World Cup in 2014, the state government cracked down on revenge killings by cops and tried community policing. It also promised better infrastructure (such as piped water) and better services (such as schools and youth centres). The death toll declined. But then a fiscal crisis hit, the money dried up and the campaign to restore the rule of law fizzled. Now Rio has a governor who urges police to shoot criminals in their ""little heads"".
Bullets do not solve crimes
Ultimately, making Brazil safe will require an overhaul of its rotten, ineffectual institutions. If the government provided people with decent public services, taxed them fairly and cracked down on the corruption which keeps state spending from reaching them, lawlessness in the favelas would eventually fall. Sadly, there is little sign that Mr Bolsonaro or his trigger-happy allies have the patience for such a task.","Brazil 's militias

DUQUE DE CAXIAS
Groups of rogue police officers are terrorising the peripheries of Rio de Janeiro
LATE LAST year mysterious trucks started dumping industrial waste at a precolonial archaeological site in Duque de Caxias, an industrial city of 900,000 people some 24km (15 miles) north of Rio de Janeiro. Environmental activists thought they knew who was behind it. Over the past decade, their battle to protect local nature reserves and the poor people who live near them has become a battle against criminal groups known as militias.
Prosecutors say that from the mid-1990s these groups, often made up of rogue police officers, started snatching swampy federal land. They filled it with dirt and sold the lots to families, mostly poor migrants from other states. In São Bento, a neighbourhood in the city, a hill overlooks thousands of identical tin-roofed shacks. ""The militias control all of it,"" says an activist. For a fee, they provide transport, water, cooking gas, cable television and internet. But they also flaunt heavy weapons, run extortion rackets and threaten to kill anyone who opposes them.
According to an investigation last year by GI, a Brazilian news site, militias control 348 square kilometres of land-roughly a quarter of the Rio de Janeiro metropolitan region. That territory is home to 2m people. Unlike drug-traffickers, who also control plenty of neighbourhoods in Rio, militias have close connections to the state. ""They're untouchable by the law because they themselves are the law,"" says José Cláudio Souza Alves, of the Federal Rural University of Rio de Janeiro. As a congressman, Jair Bolsonaro, Brazil's populist president, defended militias, though he is more careful now. ""Where the militia is paid, there is no violence,"" he claimed last year.
Violence and politics have long been intertwined in Rio de Janeiro. In the 1950s a federal deputy from Duque de Caxias prowled around with a German machinegun. A film in 1986 romanticised his life, but historians pin several dozen violent crimes on him, including at least one murder. Brazil's military dictatorship, which fell in 1985, used police death squads to kill political opponents (some of whom were urban guerrillas) and other unwanted people.
Militias evolved out of citizen-led vigilante groups that emerged in the 1990s to tackle drug gangs, says Mr Alves. Today they are de facto mafias. They thrive in the power vacuum of Rio's peripheries, offering what Mr Alves calls ""false security"". They are popular with politicians thanks to their talent for getting out the vote. Police officers among their members help them to thwart investigations. Their political ties help them to filch public money.
In 2007 Marcelo Freixo, then a state congressman from the left-wing Socialism and Liberty Party (PSOL), proposed a parliamentary commission to investigate militias. But it was not until 2008, after militiamen kidnapped and tortured two journalists and their driver, that politicians agreed to the inquiry. After months of testimony, the commission released a 282page report that accused 226 people of having militia connections, including police and army officers and city and state politicians. Most were eventually jailed.
Those who avoided prison and worse-25 of those named in the report have since been murdered-shifted their strategy to become less brazen and more enterprising, often outsourcing violence. Duque de Caxias is among Brazil's richest municipalities thanks to its oil refinery, chemical industry and position on the highway. That makes it an attractive market for what Gabriel Ferrando of the state police's organised-crime unit (draco) calls the militias' ""power project"". They have ""an absurd capacity to adapt"", he says.
By contrast, the authorities are weak. A federal judge was murdered in another part of Greater Rio in 2011. A police delegation sent in February to investigate land-grabbing in Duque de Caxias concluded that officers could not do their work without risking their lives. According to Julio José Araujo Junior, a federal prosecutor, ""our goal, frankly, is not to resolve the situation but to keep it from getting worse.""
To prosecutors' consternation, the mayor's office has sought to issue titles for irregularly OCCupied federal land. ""It's precisely this stamp of approval that the militias seek,"" says Mr Araujo. Locals say that after several low-lying areas in São Bento were declared uninhabitable and 300 families were promised apartments in a government housing project, militia members distributed the flats among families from another area, and then extorted money.
In 2016, when he was a federal congressman, the mayor of Duque de Caxias, Washington Reis, was fined by the supreme court for cutting down trees in a nature reserve in order to build an illegal housing development. He appears in Facebook photos with Chiquinho Grandāo, a city councilman accused by prosecutors in 2010 of leading an extermination squad responsible for some 50 murders. Both deny militia connections. Mr Grandāo laments the waste-dumping and land-grabbing in São Bento, but blames it on the mayor's office. He says he has ""never heard about militias"" there. The mayor's office argues that giving out titles deters illegal construction.
Militias in Duque de Caxias have also been accused of stealing sand (for building work) and petrol from government pipelines. On April 26th a leak from an illegal tap left a nine-year-old girl with third-degree burns; she died in hospital. Militias in some places hold auctions where drug gangs bid for the right to sell their wares on militia turf. In Nova Iguaçu, a city that borders Duque de Caxias, militiamen recently started extorting money from taxi drivers. The drivers were already paying off drug dealers and corrupt cops. ""So who do you report it to?"" one driver asks.
The government's plans may end up strengthening militias. Sergio Moro, the justice minister, has introduced a bill that would shield from prosecution police who kill criminals because of ""excusable fear, surprise or intense emotion"". Mr Bolsonaro has expanded the right to own and carry guns, suggesting people need them to protect themselves from criminals. ""We're returning to the origin myth that fuelled the militias,"" says Tarcísio Motta, the leader of PSOL in Rio's city council.
However, the militias' links with Mr Bolsonaro's government may provoke a backlash. There was an outcry after the murder in March last year of Marielle Franco, a city councilwoman from PSOL. In March two former cops were arrested for her murder and accused of belonging to a militia in Rio's West Zone. One lived in the same condo as Mr Bolsonaro; his daughter had dated the president's son. Another of Mr Bolsonaro's sons, Flávio, a senator from Rio, employed the wife and mother of a fugitive police officer accused of leading the same militia. Flávio and the aide who hired them are under investigation for money laundering, involving real estate deals. On May 29th President Bolsonaro's wife's uncle was arrested on suspicion of ties to an allegedly land-grabbing militia near Brasília. All deny wrongdoing.
Mr Ferrando of draco admits that militias were ""not a priority"" in the past. Now, he says, police, prosecutors and regulatory agencies will use lessons from Brazil's Lava Jato anti-corruption investigations to attack the militias' economic activities. This ""follow the money"" strategy will be put to the test in Muzema, a favela in Rio's West Zone where two apartment buildings collapsed in April, killing 24 people. The illegal properties had been built by the militia thought to be responsible for Ms Franco's murder. In the days after the tragedy, relatives watched as firefighters pulled bodies from the rubble. The sound of their pneumatic drills blended with those at new construction sites all around.","Rio 's militias

The Peronist revival
Mauricio Macri made a surprising selection for his running-mate in Argentina's presidential election in October: Miguel Ángel Pichetto, who leads the Peronist bloc in the senate. The other presidential ticket will be all-Peronist, including Cristina Fernández de Kirchner, a former president. Previous Peronist regimes have borrowed and splurged with unusual recklessness.
Jair Bolsonaro, Brazil's president, contradicted the country's central bank when he claimed a plan to create a monetary union with Argentina was under consideration. The central bank was further ruffled when Mr Bolsonaro said that a single currency could one day be used throughout South America.
Aquick U-turn
Donald Trump dropped his threat to raise tariffs on goods from Mexico, after its government promised to do more to stop migrants from Central America illegally crossing the border into the United States. In Mexico the deal was hailed for averting a potential crisis. Mr Trump's critics said that some of the details were not, in fact, new.
Mr Trump claimed executive privilege (again) in withholding details from Congress about the procedure used for placing a question on the next census about citizenship. The House oversight committee recommended that the attorney-general and commerce secretary be held in contempt for refusing to co-operate.
The New York Times decided to end political cartoons in its international edition, following the publication in April of a ""clearly anti-Semitic and indefensible"" caricature of Binyamin Netanyahu, Israel's prime minister, as a dog leading a yarmulke-wearing Mr Trump. Presumably if the paper ever publishes a reprehensible article, it will thereafter have to distribute only blank pages.

The British government amended the Climate Change Act to set a target of eliminating Britain's net emissions of greenhouse gases by 2050. The ""net zero"" target is the first in any Gy country. There are two wrinkles: it is unclear whether the target will include emissions from aviation and shipping; and policies adopted to reach the target may make use of international offsets.
Norway's parliament voted to require the country's sovereign-wealth fund, the world's largest, to divest from fossilfuel companies. Energy giants that have invested heavily in renewables, such as bp and Shell, are excluded. 1","Police in Hong Kong used rubber bullets , tear gas and water hoses on crowds demonstrating against a proposed law that would allow people to be extradited to the Chinese mainland . Three days earlier , perhaps 1 m marchers thronged the streets , worried that the law would make anyone in Hong Kong , citizens and visiting businessfolk alike , vulnerable to prosecution in Chinese courts , which are under the thumb of the Communist Party . 
 For the third time , a court in New Zealand prevented the government from extraditing a murder suspect to China . It asked the government to consider whether China could be relied upon to adhere to the human - rights treaties it has signed and whether a trial would be free from political interference .

 The Peronist revival 
 Mauricio Macri made a surprising selection for his running - mate in Argentina 's presidential election in October : Miguel Ángel Pichetto , who leads the Peronist bloc in the senate . The other presidential ticket will be all - Peronist , including Cristina Fernández de Kirchner , a former president . Previous Peronist regimes have borrowed and splurged with unusual recklessness .

 Aquick U - turn 
 Donald Trump dropped his threat to raise tariffs on goods from Mexico , after its government promised to do more to stop migrants from Central America illegally crossing the border into the United States . In Mexico the deal was hailed for averting a potential crisis . Mr Trump 's critics said that some of the details were not , in fact , new . 
 Mr Trump claimed executive privilege ( again ) in withholding details from Congress about the procedure used for placing a question on the next census about citizenship . The House oversight committee recommended that the attorney - general and commerce secretary be held in contempt for refusing to co - operate . 
 The New York Times decided to end political cartoons in its international edition , following the publication in April of a "" clearly anti - Semitic and indefensible "" caricature of Binyamin Netanyahu , Israel 's prime minister , as a dog leading a yarmulke - wearing Mr Trump . Presumably if the paper ever publishes a reprehensible article , it will thereafter have to distribute only blank pages .

It was brazil's most controversial trial since Tiradentes (""Toothpuller"") was hanged in 1792 for plotting in Minas Gerais against Portuguese colonial rule. In July 2017 Sergio Moro, a crusading young judge, convicted Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, a popular former president, of corruption, sentencing him to nine years in jail for receiving a beachside apartment from a construction magnate who obtained padded government contracts. This week that conviction was called into question after the Intercept, an investigative news website, published hacked messages from Mr Moro and Deltan Dallagnol, the chief prosecutor in the case, which appear to throw doubt on the judge's impartiality and the integrity of the prosecution.
For several reasons, Lula's situation may not change much. But the sprawling anti-corruption investigation known as Lava Jato (Car Wash) may have suffered a fatal blow. The Intercept claims to have ""an enormous trove"" of hacked messages, many of them on Telegram, an encrypted communications app. In some ways, the material published so far amounts to less than is claimed.
Lula's conviction, and his jailing after a failed appeal, barred him from running in last year's presidential election. He was leading in the opinion polls but was far from certain to win. Jair Bolsonaro, the populist eventual victor, profited from widespread hatred of Lula's Workers' Party (pt) because of its catastrophic economic mismanagement and involvement in a vast web of corruption. Nevertheless, on Telegram the prosecutors expressed alarm at the prospect of Lula giving a press interview from jail. As much as political partisanship, that looks like self-preservation, since they had reason to fear the revenge of the pt should it return to power.
More serious, perhaps, is the revelation that four days before unveiling his case against Lula, Mr Dallagnol doubted its solidity and rejoiced when his team found an old press cutting about the flat. The case relied heavily on the testimony, derived from a plea bargain, of the jailed construction magnate. Lula insists he never owned or occupied the flat.
Most damaging are the many messages Mr Moro exchanged with Mr Dallagnol, in which he appeared both to coach and to chide him. The two seemed to work closely together. Under Brazil's constitution of 1988, judges are supposed to be neutral arbiters. In practice, lawyers say, judges often exchange information with prosecutors. That is against both the law and the code of judicial ethics. In such an important case, Mr Moro should have known better than to break the rules.
Neither Mr Moro nor Mr Dallagnol has denied the authenticity of the messages, though they complain that they were obtained illegally. That means they might not be admissible as evidence in Lula's lawyers' attempt to quash his sentence. Even if they succeed, the bigger picture still looks bad for Lula. In February he was convicted, on stronger evidence, of receiving a country house from construction firms; he faces another six cases. As for Mr Moro, he had already aroused suspicion over his motives when he became Mr Bolsonaro's justice minister. He is a hero to many Brazilians. But his position now looks untenable.
Mr Moro and Mr Dallagnol were central protagonists of Lava Jato, in which some 200 businessmen, officials and politicians have been convicted. The investigation has plenty of enemies on the right as well as the left. Although many of its critics are self-interested, others worry about the prosecutors' use of preventive detention and plea bargaining. For all that, Lava Jato has broken new ground in holding the powerful to account and revealing the unbearable scale of corruption in Brazil. Its excesses should be corrected. But its enemies will now feel emboldened to ensure that further investigations of politicians die.
Mr Moro is a close student of Mani Pulite (Clean Hands), an Italian anticorruption campaign in the 1990s. It ended with a counter-revolution, led by Silvio Berlusconi, a prime minister and frequent target of investigation, which weakened judicial powers. In a study published by the imf, Maria Cristina Pinotti, a Brazilian economist, notes that in Italy since then trust in the courts and other indicators of good governance have plunged-and so have productivity and economic growth. That is a warning for Brazil, whose economy has yet to recover from a slump in 2015-16, mainly because investment remains low. Having gone so far towards punishing corruption, it would be tragic if Brazil turned back now.","Brazil 's gigantic anti - corruption probe could self - destruct

Evading justice
Investigators in the Netherlands charged three Russians and a Ukrainian with shooting down a Malaysian Airlines plane in 2014 over east Ukraine, killing all 298 people on board. International arrest warrants have been issued for the men, but since Russia has refused to co-operate with the inquiry, it seems highly unlikely they will ever face justice.

A report from the Wellcome Trust, a charity, covering 140 countries discovered that only 80% of people trust vaccines to some degree. Surprisingly, rich countries have the least faith in vaccinations. Just 36% of people in western Europe ""strongly agreed"" that vaccines are safe; those in South Asia were the most positive, with 85%. Scepticism in countries like France, where 33% think vaccines are unsafe, is not new, but with countries falling below ""immunity thresholds"", cases of measles and meningococcal diseases are rising.

A blackout left almost all of Argentina, Uruguay and parts of Paraguay without power for much of a day. Authorities are still investigating but say a cyber-attack is unlikely. The problem started when electricity surged along a transmission line in the north-east of Argentina. Power was gradually restored to tens of millions of people by late evening.

Brazil's most important economic reform is moving ahead
JAIR BOLSONARO, Brazil's president, likes romantic metaphors. ""Our marriage is stronger than ever,"" he said in May, after the press speculated that he was at odds with the economy minister, Paulo Guedes. ""The marriage ended with no hard feelings,"" he said this month after sacking Carlos Alberto dos Santos Cruz, a minister who had said that others in government should be more careful on social media-thus outraging Bolsonaro fans who tweet about the virtues of military rule and the horrors of homosexuality.
When Mr Bolsonaro took office in January investors thought he might let Mr Guedes, a free marketeer, reform the unaffordable pensions system, liberalise the economy and restore robust growth. Scandals, and the president's rocky relationships with congress and his own deputies, have spoilt that mood. In mid-May Mr Bolsonaro forwarded an opinion article to his WhatsApp contacts saying that congress was making Brazil ""ungovernable"". For the first time more Brazilians disapproved of his government than supported it. The currency, the real, reached an eight-month low. Rumours of impending impeachment spread. June brought the resignation of the respected director of the state development bank, Joaquim Levy, and leaks that embarrassed the justice minister, Sérgio Moro. ""The government is a crisis factory,"" said Rodrigo Maia, the business-friendly president of the lower house of congress.
Uncertainty is holding the economy back. GDP contracted by 0.2% in the first quarter, the first time it has shrunk since a severe recession ended in 2016. A mining disaster in January and a downturn in neighbouring Argentina were partly to blame. Economists are likely to revise downward their gloomy prediction that growth will be less than 1% this year. Capital Economics, a consultancy, calls the 2010s a ""lost decade"" for Brazil.
Despite the chaos surrounding Mr Bolsonaro's administration odds have improved that congress will reform the pension system, a precondition for resurrecting investors' confidence and therefore growth. Pensions gobble up 44% of federal spending, or 8.5% of GDP. Brazil's pension programmes are shockingly indulgent. They allow workers to retire in their midfifties and let widows and widowers receive their spouses' full benefits, which encourages May-September marriages. Brazil spends seven times as much on its oldest citizens as it does on programmes for the youngest, such as education. The regional average is four.
This is harming Brazil's future growth. Without reform, pension spending will double as a share of GDP by 2060. Public debt has jumped from 52% of GDP in 2013 to 78% now, and would soon surpass 90%. The plight of state and municipal governments is especially bad. Seven of the 27 states say that they can't pay salaries.
On May 23rd Mr Bolsonaro proposed a ""pact of understanding"" with leaders of both houses of congress and the president of the supreme court to co-operate on pensions reform and other pro-growth measures. In fact, he has ceded control to the legislature. The congressman in charge of the lower-house committee dealing with pensions recommended changes to the government's draft on June 13th. The committee is expected to vote on his plan by the end of the month. Then it will go to the full house. Since the reform requires amendments to the constitution, both the house and the senate must approve it twice with three-fifths majorities.
The congressional proposal would save the federal government about 900bn reais ($230bn) over ten years by raising the retirement age for most workers, to 65 for men and 62 for women, increasing contributions and closing loopholes. It is less ambitious than Mr Guedes's plan, which aims to save 1.2trn reais. It is more generous to the poorest and oldest pensioners and to rural workers. It scraps the idea of shifting gradually from a pay-as-you-go system to one based on individual savings accounts. It does not include government workers for the states and municipalities. Mr Guedes grumbled that the committee had ""aborted"" his reform. Its plan overstates the money it would save, he says.
His verdict may be unduly harsh. Most analysts think that the congressional plan would save enough to reassure investors. ""The day after pensions reform passes will be the start of a new Brazil,"" says Luiz França of the Brazilian Association of Real Estate Developers. ""We all have a 400m- or 5oom-real project sitting in a drawer waiting for the economy to pick up,"" says Carlos Jereissati, the ceo of Iguatemi, a chain of luxury shopping centres.
By itself, pension reform may not restore the economy to health. Though encouraging investment, it could also hurt consumer spending, since workers will need to save more for retirement, says Antonio Spilimbergo of the IMF. Italy's economy took a hit because it enacted pension reform only after a long wait and during a downturn. Cuts in other spending, needed to comply with a 20-year freeze enacted by Brazil's previous government, are weighing on growth this year. Mr Jereissati is keeping his millions in the drawer until he sees a year of growth of 2% or higher.
Another concern is that dysfunction in Brasilia will impede other reforms. To privatise state firms and cut import tariffs, the government will have to battle special interests. Mr Bolsonaro will need the co-operation of congress to revamp the tax system and reduce the public-sector wage bill. A pension reform ""might get the party started"", says Tony Volpon, an economist at ubs, a bank. ""But we're one Twitter storm away from this all going to hell.""","Pensions in Brazil

In mid - May Jair Bolsonaro forwarded an opinion article to Jair Bolsonaro's WhatsApp contacts saying that congress was making Brazil "" ungovernable "" . For the first time more Brazilians disapproved of Jair Bolsonaro's government than supported it . The currency , the real , reached an eight - month low . Rumours of impending impeachment spread . June brought the resignation of the respected director of the state development bank , Joaquim Levy , and leaks that embarrassed the justice minister , Sérgio Moro . "" The government is a crisis factory , "" said Rodrigo Maia , the business - friendly president of the lower house of congress . 
 Uncertainty is holding the economy back . GDP contracted by 0.2 % in the first quarter , the first time it has shrunk since a severe recession ended in 2016 . A mining disaster in January and a downturn in neighbouring Argentina were partly to blame . Economists are likely to revise downward their gloomy prediction that growth will be less than 1 % this year . Capital Economics , a consultancy , calls the 2010s a "" lost decade "" for Brazil . 
 Despite the chaos surrounding Jair Bolsonaro's administration odds have improved that congress will reform the pension system , a precondition for resurrecting investors ' confidence and therefore growth . Pensions gobble up 44 % of federal spending , or 8.5 % of GDP . Brazil 's pension programmes are shockingly indulgent . They allow workers to retire in their midfifties and let widows and widowers receive their spouses ' full benefits , which encourages May - September marriages . Brazil spends seven times as much on its oldest citizens as it does on programmes for the youngest , such as education . The regional average is four . 
 This is harming Brazil 's future growth . Without reform , pension spending will double as a share of GDP by 2060 . Public debt has jumped from 52 % of GDP in 2013 to 78 % now , and would soon surpass 90 % . The plight of state and municipal governments is especially bad . Seven of the 27 states say that they ca n't pay salaries . 
 On May 23rd Jair Bolsonaro proposed a "" pact of understanding "" with leaders of both houses of congress and the president of the supreme court to co - operate on pensions reform and other pro - growth measures . In fact , Jair Bolsonaro has ceded control to the legislature . The congressman in charge of the lower - house committee dealing with pensions recommended changes to the government 's draft on June 13th . The committee is expected to vote on his plan by the end of the month . Then it will go to the full house . Since the reform requires amendments to the constitution , both the house and the senate must approve it twice with three - fifths majorities . 
 The congressional proposal would save the federal government about 900bn reais ( $ 230bn ) over ten years by raising the retirement age for most workers , to 65 for men and 62 for women , increasing contributions and closing loopholes . It is less ambitious than Mr Guedes 's plan , which aims to save 1.2trn reais . It is more generous to the poorest and oldest pensioners and to rural workers . It scraps the idea of shifting gradually from a pay - as - you - go system to one based on individual savings accounts . It does not include government workers for the states and municipalities . Mr Guedes grumbled that the committee had "" aborted "" his reform . Its plan overstates the money it would save , he says . 
 His verdict may be unduly harsh . Most analysts think that the congressional plan would save enough to reassure investors . "" The day after pensions reform passes will be the start of a new Brazil , "" says Luiz França of the Brazilian Association of Real Estate Developers . "" We all have a 400m- or 5oom - real project sitting in a drawer waiting for the economy to pick up , "" says Carlos Jereissati , the ceo of Iguatemi , a chain of luxury shopping centres . 
 By itself , pension reform may not restore the economy to health . Though encouraging investment , it could also hurt consumer spending , since workers will need to save more for retirement , says Antonio Spilimbergo of the IMF . Italy 's economy took a hit because it enacted pension reform only after a long wait and during a downturn . Cuts in other spending , needed to comply with a 20 - year freeze enacted by Brazil 's previous government , are weighing on growth this year . Mr Jereissati is keeping his millions in the drawer until he sees a year of growth of 2 % or higher . 
 Another concern is that dysfunction in Brasilia will impede other reforms . To privatise state firms and cut import tariffs , the government will have to battle special interests . Jair Bolsonaro will need the co - operation of congress to revamp the tax system and reduce the public - sector wage bill . A pension reform "" might get the party started "" , says Tony Volpon , an economist at ubs , a bank . "" But we 're one Twitter storm away from this all going to hell .

THE LONG war between the state and the communist guerrilla army of the FARC may be over, but governing Colombia is no cakewalk. The ELN, another nominally Marxist outfit, still threatens, as do violent drug-traffickers and dissidents from the FARC. Geography sometimes conspires against development. Last month a mountainside collapsed, taking with it part of a new motorway linking Bogotá with the south-eastern lowlands. The government is helping more than 1.3m Venezuelans who have fled their country in the past three years.
These and other problems face Iván Duque, who became president last August. Aged 42, he appealed to Colombians as a fresh face, keen on technology and creative industries and with a mantra of ""legality, enterprise and fairness"". Though he is part of South America's swing to the right, he is not Brazil's Jair Bolsonaro. He accepts unquestioningly the decisions of courts and of congress. He worries about deforestation and climate change. ""Our migration policy is based on fraternity and not xenophobia,"" he says, and he clearly means it.
But he was elected for the conservative party of Alvaro Uribe, an embittered former president. Mr Duque has often seemed trapped in the political battles of Colombia's recent past. These centre on the peace agreement of November 2016 between his predecessor, Juan Manuel Santos, and the FARC. Under this, some 13,000 guerrillas disarmed; the FARC's new political party gained ten temporary seats in congress; and the government promised rural development. Guerrilla leaders (and army commanders) are supposed to confess their war crimes to a special peace tribunal and then face temporary ""restrictions on liberty"".
Mr Duque thought the agreement too soft but as president has pledged to carry it out. Its core provision is succeeding: the vast majority of the former guerrillas have returned to civilian life. ""We can't afford to fail in that,"" Mr Duque told The Economist. Beyond that, the arguments start.
Critics accuse the new government of doing too little for rural development, which is essential to make the most of peace and avoid another war. That may be true, but Mr Duque retorts that he has done more in less time than his predecessor. He points to locally agreed development plans for 16 formerly conflict-ridden areas that are under way. He says his government has so far issued titles for 300,000 hectares of rural land.
Then there is the peace tribunal. Mr Uribe's supporters fear that it is biased in favour of the FARC. That seemed to be borne out last month when the tribunal freed Jésus Santrich, a FARC commander whom American authorities accuse of trafficking cocaine after the peace deal. An attempt by Mr Duque's government to subject FARC commanders to tougher terms by partially rewriting the peace agreement was rejected last month by congress and the constitutional court. It would be better to broaden the tribunal's membership. An official says he sees an opportunity for that. If the supreme court reverses the tribunal's decision and extradites Mr Santrich, who sits in congress, that could reduce tensions within Mr Duque's political base.
Another inherited headache is that coca production rose in Mr Santos's final years, exacerbating turf wars over cocaine exports. ""You can't build a lasting peace with 200,000 hectares of coca,"" says Mr Duque. His government wants the constitutional court to lift a ban on spraying the crop with herbicide. ""Spraying is not a silver bullet,"" he says. ""But it has to be a tool. Some areas of coca are protected by landmines and snipers.""
Mr Duque's main challenge is to develop clear policies of his own. They should start with security. Much of the countryside remains unsafe. Some 135 demobilised guerrillas have been murdered. Community leaders are also being killed. Colombia needs to rethink security policy for a post-FARC era, with greater use of intelligence and civilian co-operation. The new army commander, General Nicacio Martinez, issued orders that seemed to encourage his forces to increase the body count-a throwback to a controversial policy under Mr Uribe. There is no evidence that killings have risen. But that approach is misguided.
Mr Duque ""has yet to find his own feet,"" says Malcolm Deas, a British historian of Colombia, who suggests that he formalise his relationship with Mr Uribe, for example by confining it to scheduled meetings. He could complement that by developing his own political base in the centre. He has time to become a good president. But the clock is ticking.","Can Colombia's President Iván Duque find his feet?

VLADIMIR PUTIN, Russia's president, has declared the liberal idea ""obsolete"". It will not surprise you to learn that we disagree. Not just because he told the Financial Times that liberalism was all about immigration, multiculturalism and gender politics-a travesty-but also because he picked the wrong target. The idea most under threat in the West is conservatism. And you do not have to be a conservative to find that deeply troubling.
In two-party systems, like the United States and (broadly) Britain, the right is in power, but only by jettisoning the values that used to define it. In countries with many parties the centreright is being eroded, as in Germany and Spain, or eviscerated, as in France and Italy. And in other places, like Hungary, with a shorter democratic tradition, the right has gone straight to populism without even trying conservatism.
Conservatism is not so much a philosophy as a disposition. The philosopher Michael Oakeshott put it best: ""To be conservative...is to prefer the familiar to the unknown, to prefer the tried to the untried, fact to mystery, the actual to the possible, the limited to the unbounded, the near to the distant."" Like classical liberalism, conservatism is a child of the Enlightenment. Liberals say that social order emerges spontaneously from individuals acting freely, but conservatives believe social order comes first, creating the conditions for freedom. It looks to the authority of family, church, tradition and local associations to control change, and slow it down. You sweep away institutions at your peril. Yet just such a demolition is happening to conservatism itself-and it is coming from the right.
The new right is not an evolution of conservatism, but a repudiation of it. The usurpers are aggrieved and discontent. They are pessimists and reactionaries. They look at the world and see what President Donald Trump once called ""carnage"".
Consider how they are smashing one conservative tradition after another. Conservatism is pragmatic, but the new right is zealous, ideological and cavalier with the truth. Australia suffers droughts and reef-bleaching seas, but the right has just won an election there under a party whose leader addressed parliament holding a lump of coal like a holy relic. In Italy Matteo Salvini, leader of the Northern League, has boosted the anti-vaxxer movement. For Mr Trump ""facts"" are just devices to puff up his image or slogans designed to stir up outrage and tribal loyalties.
Conservatives are cautious about change, but the right now airily contemplates revolution. Alternative for Germany has flirted with a referendum on membership of the euro. Were Mr Trump to carry out his threats to leave nato (see ""The World If"" in this issue), it would up-end the balance of power. A no-deal Brexit would be a leap into the unknown, but Tories yearn for it, even if it destroys the union with Scotland and Northern Ireland.
Conservatives believe in character, because politics is about judgment as well as reason. They are suspicious of charisma and personality cults. In America plenty of Republicans who know better have fallen in with Mr Trump even though he has been credibly accused by 16 different women of sexual misconduct. Brazilians have elected Jair Bolsonaro, who fondly recalls the days of military rule. The charismatic Boris Johnson is favourite to be Britain's next prime minister, despite being mistrusted by mps, because he is deemed to be the ""Heineken Tory"" who will, like the beer, refresh the parts other conservatives cannot reach.
Conservatives respect business and are prudent stewards of the economy, because prosperity underpins everything. Hungary's prime minister, Viktor Orban, paints himself as a low-tax economic conservative, but undermines the rule of law on which businesses depend. Mr Trump is a wager of trade wars. Over 60% of Tory members are willing to inflict ""serious damage"" on the economy to secure Brexit. In Italy the League is spooking markets by toying with issuing government paper that would act as a parallel currency to the euro. In Poland Law and Justice has splashed out on a welfare bonanza. In France, in the campaign for the European Parliament elections, the rump Republican Party made more of a splash about Europe's ""Jude°Christian roots"" than prudent economic management.
Last, the right is changing what it means to belong. In Hungary and Poland the right exults in blood-and-soil nationalism, which excludes and discriminates. Vox, a new force in Spain, harks back to the Reconquista, when Christians kicked out the Muslims. An angry, reactionary nationalism kindles suspicion, hatred and division. It is the antithesis of the conservative insight that belonging to the nation, a church and the local community can unite people and motivate them to act in the common good.
Conservatism has been radicalised for several reasons. One is the decline of what Edmund Burke called the ""little platoons"" that it relied on, such as religion, unions and the family. Another is that the old parties on both right and left were discredited by the financial crisis, austerity and the long wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. Outside the cities, people feel as if they are sneered at by greedy, self-serving urban sophisticates. A few have been wound up by the xenophobia of political entrepreneurs. The collapse of the Soviet Union, some believe, loosened the glue uniting a coalition of foreign-policy hawks, libertarians and cultural and pro-business conservatives. None of these trends will be easy to reverse.
The right stuff
That does not mean everything is going the way of parties of the new right. In Britain and America, at least, demography is against them. Their voters are white and relatively old. Universities are a right-wing-free zone. A survey by Pew last year found that 59% of American millennial voters were Democratic or leaned Democratic; the corresponding share of Republicans was only 32%. Among the ""silent generation"", born in 1928-45, Democrats scored 43% and Republicans 52%. It is not clear enough young people will drift to the right as they age to fill the gap.
But the new right is clearly winning its fight against Enlightenment conservatism. For classical liberals, like this newspaper, that is a source of regret. Conservatives and liberals disagree about many things, such as drugs and sexual freedom. But they are more often allies. Both reject the Utopian impulse to find a 1 government solution for every wrong. Both resist state planning and high taxes. The conservative inclination to police morals is offset by an impulse to guard free speech and to promote freedom and democracy around the world. Indeed conservatives and liberals often bring out the best in each other. Conservatism tempers liberal zeal; liberals puncture conservative complacency.
The new right is, by contrast, implacably hostile towards classical liberals. The risk is that moderates will be squeezed out as right and left inflame politics and provoke each other to move to the extremes. Voters may be left without a choice. Recoiling against Mr Trump, Democrats have moved further to the left on immigration than the country at large. The British, with two big parties, may have to pick between Jeremy Corbyn, Labour's hardleft leader, and a radicalised Tory party under Mr Johnson. Even if you can vote for the centre, as with Emmanuel Macron in France, one party will win repeatedly by default-which, in the long run, is unhealthy for democracy.
At its best conservatism can be a steadying influence. It is reasonable and wise; it values competence; it is not in a hurry. Those days are over. Today's right is on fire and it is dangerous.","The new right is not an evolution of conservatism, but a repudiation of it

Australia suffers droughts and reef-bleaching seas, but the right has just won an election there under a party whose leader addressed parliament holding a lump of coal like a holy relic. In Italy Matteo Salvini, leader of the Northern League, has boosted the anti-vaxxer movement. For Mr Trump ""facts"" are just devices to puff up his image or slogans designed to stir up outrage and tribal loyalties.
Conservatives are cautious about change, but the right now airily contemplates revolution. Alternative for Germany has flirted with a referendum on membership of the euro. Were Mr Trump to carry out his threats to leave nato (see ""The World If"" in this issue), it would up-end the balance of power. A no-deal Brexit would be a leap into the unknown, but Tories yearn for it, even if it destroys the union with Scotland and Northern Ireland.
Conservatives believe in character, because politics is about judgment as well as reason. They are suspicious of charisma and personality cults. In America plenty of Republicans who know better have fallen in with Mr Trump even though he has been credibly accused by 16 different women of sexual misconduct. Brazilians have elected Jair Bolsonaro, who fondly recalls the days of military rule. The charismatic Boris Johnson is favourite to be Britain's next prime minister, despite being mistrusted by mps, because he is deemed to be the ""Heineken Tory"" who will, like the beer, refresh the parts other conservatives cannot reach.
Conservatives respect business and are prudent stewards of the economy, because prosperity underpins everything. Hungary's prime minister, Viktor Orban, paints himself as a low-tax economic conservative, but undermines the rule of law on which businesses depend. Mr Trump is a wager of trade wars. Over 60% of Tory members are willing to inflict ""serious damage"" on the economy to secure Brexit. In Italy the League is spooking markets by toying with issuing government paper that would act as a parallel currency to the euro. In Poland Law and Justice has splashed out on a welfare bonanza. In France, in the campaign for the European Parliament elections, the rump Republican Party made more of a splash about Europe's ""Jude°Christian roots"" than prudent economic management.
Last, the right is changing what it means to belong. In Hungary and Poland the right exults in blood-and-soil nationalism, which excludes and discriminates. Vox, a new force in Spain, harks back to the Reconquista, when Christians kicked out the Muslims. An angry, reactionary nationalism kindles suspicion, hatred and division. It is the antithesis of the conservative insight that belonging to the nation, a church and the local community can unite people and motivate them to act in the common good.
Conservatism has been radicalised for several reasons. One is the decline of what Edmund Burke called the ""little platoons"" that it relied on, such as religion, unions and the family. Another is that the old parties on both right and left were discredited by the financial crisis, austerity and the long wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. Outside the cities, people feel as if they are sneered at by greedy, self-serving urban sophisticates. A few have been wound up by the xenophobia of political entrepreneurs. The collapse of the Soviet Union, some believe, loosened the glue uniting a coalition of foreign-policy hawks, libertarians and cultural and pro-business conservatives. None of these trends will be easy to reverse.
The right stuff
That does not mean everything is going the way of parties of the new right. In Britain and America, at least, demography is against them. Their voters are white and relatively old. Universities are a right-wing-free zone. A survey by Pew last year found that 59% of American millennial voters were Democratic or leaned Democratic; the corresponding share of Republicans was only 32%. Among the ""silent generation"", born in 1928-45, Democrats scored 43% and Republicans 52%. It is not clear enough young people will drift to the right as they age to fill the gap.
But the new right is clearly winning its fight against Enlightenment conservatism. For classical liberals, like this newspaper, that is a source of regret. Conservatives and liberals disagree about many things, such as drugs and sexual freedom. But they are more often allies. Both reject the Utopian impulse to find a 1 government solution for every wrong. Both resist state planning and high taxes. The conservative inclination to police morals is offset by an impulse to guard free speech and to promote freedom and democracy around the world. Indeed conservatives and liberals often bring out the best in each other. Conservatism tempers liberal zeal; liberals puncture conservative complacency.
The new right is, by contrast, implacably hostile towards classical liberals. The risk is that moderates will be squeezed out as right and left inflame politics and provoke each other to move to the extremes. Voters may be left without a choice. Recoiling against Mr Trump, Democrats have moved further to the left on immigration than the country at large. The British, with two big parties, may have to pick between Jeremy Corbyn, Labour's hardleft leader, and a radicalised Tory party under Mr Johnson. Even if you can vote for the centre, as with Emmanuel Macron in France, one party will win repeatedly by default-which, in the long run, is unhealthy for democracy.
At its best conservatism can be a steadying influence. It is reasonable and wise; it values competence; it is not in a hurry. Those days are over. Today's right is on fire and it is dangerous.",140,Brazil,ctb-140-2,,False,,0,True

IT WAS NOT João Gilberto's fault, and as a perfectionist no doubt he suffered from it more than anyone, that his greatest hit, ""The Girl from Ipanema"", has been mutilated into supermarket Muzak. At its height, in the late 1950s and early 1960s, the Brazilian fusion of samba, jazz, and other things too, known as bossa nova (""new style"" in Portuguese) entranced the world. Back home, it formed the soundtrack to a period of cultural originality, from architecture to football, that seemed to augur a bright future for Brazil. As a guitarist and singer Mr Gilberto, who died an impoverished recluse on July 6th, aged 88, was a star of that moment. He lived to see a darker present.
Born in the arid backlands of Brazil's north-east, Mr Gilberto arrived in Rio de Janeiro in 1950 as a singer in one of the then-fashionable vocal ensembles. After his career stalled he retreated, broke and on the verge of mental illness, to a kind of internal exile. He spent months closeted with his guitar in a bedroom of a sister's house, obsessively stripping down and rebuilding his way of playing it. He emerged with the terse, syncopated rhythm, complex chords and a gentle, almost spoken, singing style that were the marks of bossa nova.
He returned to a Rio in musical ferment. A loose fellowship of bohemian young, mainly middle-class musicians, whose habitat was beachside apartments and the nightclubs of Copacabana, was striving to escape from traditional Brazilian folklore. Two stood out: Antônio Carlos (""Tom"") Jobim, a prodigiously talented pianist and composer (and fan of Debussy), and Vinicius de Moraes, a hard-drinking diplomat, poet and lyricist. In 1957 Mr Gilberto knocked on the door of Jobim's house in Ipanema-and began to make history.
It started with ""Chega de Saudade"" (""No More Blues"", in its American release), a short single which gave its title to an album that sold 500,000 copies in Brazil. Its controlled phrasing was seen as ""a kick up the backside"" to the era of romantic crooners, according to Ruy Castro, bossa nova's chronicler. Jobim and de Moraes's ""The Girl from Ipanema"", a languid musing on the wistful contemplation of beauty by age, had its first performance, by Mr Gilberto, in a Rio nightclub in 1962. That was both zenith and swansong for bossa nova. The new music conquered the world, starting with a concert in Carnegie Hall in New York. Mr Gilberto made a hugely successful album with Stan Getz, an American saxophonist. But in Brazil bossa nova was yielding ground to protest music, rock 'n' roll and a return to traditional samba.
According to Caetano Veloso, a popular musician of a later generation, ""bossa nova is a rare example of music that becomes popular by becoming more sophisticated."" It varied to samba in its harmonic complexity, as well as in the intimate introspection and sensuality of its lyrics.
The bossa nova era was one of two great, creative ebullitions in 20th-century Brazil. The first came in the 1920s when a group of painters and writers embraced modernism under the banner of antropofagia (cultural cannibalism). Rather than merely imitating or rejecting foreign works of art, they consumed and then regurgitated them to create something both authentically Brazilian and universal.
That approach came back in the late 1950s, when Brazil was enjoying a precarious period of democracy. Under Juscelino Kubitschek, a dashing social democrat, the country rushed not just to industrialise but to embrace the modern in general. As well as bossa nova, that impulse included the minimalist palaces of Oscar Niemeyer that adorned Brasilia, the new capital; the concretist movement of poets and artists such as Mira Schendel and Lygia Clark; and, later, cinema novo, in which film directors adopted the techniques of Italian neorealists to address Brazil's social divides.
As Mr Veloso told the Guardian in 2013, ""what was revolutionary about bossa nova is that a third-world country was creating high art on its own terms and selling that art around the world. It remains a dream of what an ideal civilisation can create.""
The dream did not last long. A military coup in 1964 brought the curtain down on the bossa nova era. Now Brazil's restored democracy is headed by Jair Bolsonaro, a socially conservative Pentecostalist who is openly nostalgic for military rule. In its sensitivity, disciplined search for perfection and openness to foreign influence, bossa nova was everything that Mr Bolsonaro's vision of Brazil-vulgar, hate-filled and nationalistic-is not.

BOGOTÁ, CARACAS, MEXICO CITY, QUITO AND SĀO PAULO
As the energy industry braces itself for future disruption, the region's national oil companies are stuck in the past
OIL, IT IS often noted, can bring a country both wealth and woe. In Venezuela, by some measures home to the world's largest proven oil reserves, it has mostly been the latter of late. Petróleos de Venezuela (PDVSA) saw production peak in 1998, when Hugo Chávez was elected president. In the years that followed the left-wing tribune and his authoritarian successor, Nicolás Maduro, purged PDVSA's professional staff, strong-armed its international partners and raided its coffers. A sweeping American probe of bribery at the company has so far charged more than 20 people. Its current boss is a brigadier general with no oil experience. Since January, when America announced tough sanctions on PDVSA, production has plunged to the lowest levels per citizen since the 1920s. Meanwhile, millions of Venezuelans lack food and basic medicine.
PDVSA is a caricature of mismanagement. But a survey of state-controlled energy giants in Latin America, which accounts for around 10% of global oil output and 20% of proven reserves, shows dysfunction is not confined to Venezuela. Five years after the oil price crashed, output remains depressed in much of the region, even as the industry as a whole faces unprecedented disruption. The shale boom helped the United States produce 15.3m barrels of oil a day last year, about onesixth of global output. Concerns about carbon emissions and the rise of electric cars mean that worries about peak supply have been supplanted by fears of peak demand.
This uncertainty has added new urgency to the old question of how to maximise the value of crude reserves. Instead of tackling this head on, Latin America's national energy champions-or rather, their political taskmasters-are relitigating debates of yore. Subject firms to political pressures or keep them independent? Invite foreign investment or shun it? Maximise efficiency or create jobs? Subsidise petrol or let prices move with the market? Their responses have, for the most part, been discouraging.
States control about 90% of the world's oil and gas reserves. They do so in different ways, as Latin America illustrates. In Guyana, the region's youngest petrostate, production is about to boom following a discovery in 2015 by ExxonMobil, but the country has yet to create its own oil company. Pemex, by contrast, was founded as a state-owned monopoly in Mexico in 1938. Other countries have both state companies and foreign ones, often in an uneasy partnership. Brazil's state-run giant, Petrobras, listed shares in America in 2000. Its Argentine and Colombian counterparts also have private minority shareholders. In Ecuador the state controls more than 80% of oil output. Perupetro, Peru's firm-cum-regulator, oversees private companies' exploration and production. Venezuela, having opened up its oil sector in the 1990s, in 2006 declared that PDVSA would take majority control of oilfields managed by foreign firms. bp and Chevron were among those that agreed; ExxonMobil and ConocoPhillips packed their bags.
Despite their different corporate forms, most of Latin America's oil giants share three problems in common. The first is mismanagement of cash in good times. That included pouring too much money into government coffers and too little into investment for future growth. In 2013, when the oil price topped $100 a barrel, Pemex transferred about half of its revenue to Mexico's government. Despite rising crude prices, Petrobras saw its share price decline, as it loaded up on debt and invested in too many marginal projects. As oil prices plummeted, Latin America's oil companies 1 racked up long-term liabilities of more than $400bn, or 8.5% of their countries' combined GDP, according to data from the Natural Resource Governance Institute, a think-tank. Petrobras accounted for nearly half the total.
Some politicians and executives also used the companies as personal piggy banks-the second common problem. Corruption scandals rocked Petrobras, Petroecuador and Pemex, as well as PDVSA. Petrobras took a particular nosedive when it emerged that construction firms paid Brazilian politicians billions of dollars in bribes in exchange for padded contracts to build refineries and other infrastructure. This, combined with the mountain of debt, led credit-rating agencies to downgrade Petrobras to junk in 2015. Between August 2014 and February 2016 the company's market capitalisation shrivelled by $115bn, or 80%. Only some of that was down to the collapsing oil price; ExxonMobil's stock dipped by 18% in the period (see chart).
There are signs the sleaze is being cleaned up in Brazil and elsewhere. Several senior Petrobras executives, and scores of Brazilian politicians, have been prosecuted over the Petrolāo (""Big Oily"") affair. On July 5th Mexican authorities said they had issued an arrest warrant for Emilio Lozoya, who led Pemex from 2012 to 2016 (and has fled the country). As Lenín Moreno, Ecuador's president, mops up the mess at Petroecuador, American prosecutors continue to file charges alleging bribery at the company during the tenure of his predecessor, Rafael Correa.
However, companies remain susceptible to political whims-the third and most vexing shared challenge. Start with Petrobras. The region's biggest producer has made progress. Last year it agreed to pay minority shareholders $2.95bn in a classaction settlement in America. Pedro Parente, who became chief executive in 2016, cut costs, began selling less profitable assets, reformed pricing policy and set about boosting production from vast resources tucked under thousands of metres of salt beneath the seabed.
Still, Petrobras remains vulnerable to political undulations. Last year the government reintroduced petrol subsidies to appease angry lorry drivers. Mr Parente resigned and Petrobras shares took a knock. Jair Bolsonaro, Brazil's new president, appointed Roberto Castello Branco, a well-regarded economist who had served on the company's board and looked set to continue Mr Parente's market-friendly policies.
But faced with the risk of another strike in April, Mr Bolsonaro asked him to scrap plans for a 5.7% increase in the price of diesel. Petrobras's share price, which had risen sixfold since the trough in 2016, wobbled. The government rushed to calm the market, announcing the auction of several oil refineries and a price increase only slightly lower than planned. But investors are shaken. ""You're not going to sell a single screw of a refinery until the market has confidence that there won't be government interference,"" says one local oil veteran.
Crisis of abundance
The situation in Mexico, second to Brazil in regional oil production, looks worse. Pemex has been a symbol of sovereignty and national pride since Lázaro Cárdenas expropriated oilfields in 1938. With oil tethered to politics, strategy has been liable to swing from one presidency to the next. As Mexico realised the potential of the giant offshore Cantarell field in the 1970s, José López Portillo, the president, declared that all Mexico needed to do was ""manage the abundance"". Instead the Cantarell boom bred complacency and investment declined. Last year the field produced 80,000 barrels per day, down from 2m in 2014.
Complicating matters, for years Pemex has borrowed money to pay its taxes, accumulating government-guaranteed loans. This has turned it into a vehicle for public debt, leaving Mexico particularly vulnerable to its waning fortunes. Pemex has overtaken Petrobras as the world's most indebted oil company, with long-term liabilities equivalent to 15% of Mexico's GDP. On June 6th Fitch Ratings stripped it of its investment grade.
Pemex is now led by a political ally of Andrés Manuel López Obrador, Mexico's populist president, with no experience in oil or gas. It had sought foreign partners to jump-start production, but Mr López Obrador has frozen future auctions of exploration sites. Keen to reduce dependence on American fuel imports, he plans to build a refinery in his home state of Tabasco for $8bn (or more), which may aggravate Pemex's woes, not alleviate them. Mr López Obrador's finance minister has just resigned, apparently in part because he objected to the president's strategy for Pemex (see Americas section). Further plans for the company are expected this month. JPMorgan Chase, a bank, described an earlier rescue package as worse than underwhelming. Fitch thinks taxes would need to be halved for the company to retain enough cash either to invest in its business or pay down debt. The president's goal of raising crude production by around 50% by 2024, from 1.7m today, looks fanciful.
Latin America's other state oil champions are minnows next to Petrobras and Pemex. But their experiences are nevertheless instructive. In Argentina, the oil industry has been scarred by the decision in 2012 by the then president, Cristina Fernández de Kirchner, to renationalise 51% of YPF, privatised 19 years earlier. Ms Fernández's market-friendly successor, Mauricio Macri, has made it easier for foreign firms to invest in the country.
As it competes with overseas rivals, and forms occasional partnerships with them, YPF is at last beginning to tap Argentina's rich shale deposits in the Vaca Muerta formation in northern Patagonia. But in dollar terms, the company's share price languishes 80% below its peak in 2005. Progress could be undone if Ms Fernández's Peronist ally wins the presidency (the former president herself is currently cam- paigning as his running mate).
In some ways the region's brightest spot has been Colombia. Alvaro Uribe, president from 2002 to 2010, set about restructuring Ecopetrol. His changes included the creation of an independent regulator and the listing of 11% of Ecopetrol shares, which provided an infusion of capital that helped the company enlist better managers. In 2015 it recruited Felipe Bayón Pardo, a former senior executive at BP, a British oil giant, who became boss in 2017. After the downturn in oil prices at the end of 2014, Ecopetrol slashed spending. When prices ticked up, spending rose, though more slowly than in Mexico. But Ecopetrol's reserves are dwindling. To boost them, it is teaming up with international oil majors and investing $500m in fracking.
Success is not assured, in Colombia or elsewhere. The International Energy Agency, an intergovernmental forecaster, predicted that Brazilian output would boom last year-yet output dipped as new oilfields were slow to begin production and mature ones fell.
Those concerned about climate change might argue that the region's inefficient state-run firms would do well to return more money to shareholders and invest the rest in cleaner energy. Rivals in other parts of the world are taking tentative steps in that direction. Statoil, Norway's titan, has reinvented itself as Equinor; its portfolio comprises both oil projects and wind farms. Even the world's oil colossus, Saudi Aramco, is making a bet on petrochemicals and refining, demand for which should remain robust even if a global carbon price one day depressed that for crude. Latin American oilmen are too consumed by old challenges to deal with these new ones.","Oil in Latin America

Pemex has overtaken Petrobras as the world 's most indebted oil company , with long - term liabilities equivalent to 15 % of Mexico 's GDP . On June 6th Fitch Ratings stripped it of its investment grade . 
 Pemex is now led by a political ally of Andrés Manuel López Obrador , Mexico 's populist president , with no experience in oil or gas . It had sought foreign partners to jump - start production , but Mr López Obrador has frozen future auctions of exploration sites . Keen to reduce dependence on American fuel imports , he plans to build a refinery in his home state of Tabasco for $ 8bn ( or more ) , which may aggravate Pemex 's woes , not alleviate them . Mr López Obrador 's finance minister has just resigned , apparently in part because he objected to the president 's strategy for Pemex ( see Americas section ) . Further plans for the company are expected this month . JPMorgan Chase , a bank , described an earlier rescue package as worse than underwhelming . Fitch thinks taxes would need to be halved for the company to retain enough cash either to invest in its business or pay down debt . The president 's goal of raising crude production by around 50 % by 2024 , from 1.7 m today , looks fanciful . 
 Latin America 's other state oil champions are minnows next to Petrobras and Pemex . But their experiences are nevertheless instructive . In Argentina , the oil industry has been scarred by the decision in 2012 by the then president , Cristina Fernández de Kirchner , to renationalise 51 % of YPF , privatised 19 years earlier . Ms Fernández 's market - friendly successor , Mauricio Macri , has made it easier for foreign firms to invest in the country . 
 As it competes with overseas rivals , and forms occasional partnerships with them , YPF is at last beginning to tap Argentina 's rich shale deposits in the Vaca Muerta formation in northern Patagonia . But in dollar terms , the company 's share price languishes 80 % below its peak in 2005 . Progress could be undone if Ms Fernández 's Peronist ally wins the presidency ( the former president herself is currently cam- paigning as his running mate ) . 
 In some ways the region 's brightest spot has been Colombia . Alvaro Uribe , president from 2002 to 2010 , set about restructuring Ecopetrol . His changes included the creation of an independent regulator and the listing of 11 % of Ecopetrol shares , which provided an infusion of capital that helped the company enlist better managers . In 2015 it recruited Felipe Bayón Pardo , a former senior executive at BP , a British oil giant , who became boss in 2017 . After the downturn in oil prices at the end of 2014 , Ecopetrol slashed spending . When prices ticked up , spending rose , though more slowly than in Mexico . But Ecopetrol 's reserves are dwindling . To boost them , it is teaming up with international oil majors and investing $ 500 m in fracking . 
 Success is not assured , in Colombia or elsewhere . The International Energy Agency , an intergovernmental forecaster , predicted that Brazilian output would boom last year - yet output dipped as new oilfields were slow to begin production and mature ones fell . 
 Those concerned about climate change might argue that the region 's inefficient state - run firms would do well to return more money to shareholders and invest the rest in cleaner energy . Rivals in other parts of the world are taking tentative steps in that direction . Statoil , Norway 's titan , has reinvented itself as Equinor ; its portfolio comprises both oil projects and wind farms . Even the world 's oil colossus , Saudi Aramco , is making a bet on petrochemicals and refining , demand for which should remain robust even if a global carbon price one day depressed that for crude . Latin American oilmen are too consumed by old challenges to deal with these new ones .",140,Brazil,ctb-140-2,IN TERM,True,"Jair Bolsonaro , Brazil 's new president ,",2,True

ABUJA AND JOHANNESBURG
The uses and misuses of Africa's most popular messaging platform
""WHEN I OPEN my phone, I am W swamped by news,"" says Matthew Stanley, a driver in Abuja, Nigeria's capital. He scrolls through WhatsApp, a messaging service, bringing up a slick video forwarded into his church group. In a tone befitting a trailer for a horror film, the narrator falsely claims that Muhammadu Buhari, Nigeria's Muslim president, is plotting to kill Christians. Mr Stanley squints at the tiny screen. ""I think it's fake news,"" he says. ""I need to check the source.""
If only everyone were so sceptical. WhatsApp, which has i.5bn users globally, is especially influential in Africa. It is the most popular social platform in countries such as Nigeria, Ghana, Kenya and South Africa. In the West it is common for people to use multiple platforms such as Facebook and Twitter (see Graphic detail) but in African countries, where money is tighter and internet connections patchy, WhatsApp is an efficient one-stop-shop. The ability to leave audio notes makes it popular among illiterate people. But WhatsApp's ubiquity also makes it a political tool.
That much is clear from Nigerian presidential and state elections in February and March. As recent research by Nic Cheeseman, Jamie Hitchen, Jonathan Fisher and Idayat Hassan indicates, Nigerians' use of WhatsApp both reflects and exploits the country's social structures.
For example, Nigerians belong to much larger WhatsApp groups than Westerners do. A survey by Mr Hitchen and Ms Hassan in Kano, a northern city, found that locals are typically in groups of at least 50 people. These may be made up of school acquaintances, work colleagues or fellow worshippers. The larger the group, the more quickly information can spread. And since these groups often comprise friends and community leaders, recipients are inclined to trust what they read.
Nigeria's use of WhatsApp reflects its political culture as well. Nigerian elections may not be clean, but they are competitive, points out Matthew Page of Chatham House, a think-tank. ""Big man"" politicians try to win through patronage rather than policy. Both of the two main presidential candidates, Mr Buhari, the eventual victor, and Atiku Abubakar, had large social-media teams. They had dedicated WhatsApp groups for supporters in every one of Nigeria's 36 states and 774 municipalities.
The parties deny that they spread lies. But they need not do so themselves. Being close to a politician is often the surest way to a steady income in Nigeria. That has led to a cottage industry of social-media entrepreneurs seeking to please. These ""propaganda secretaries"", as they are known, produce videos, tendentiously caption photographs and disseminate memes for ad hoc payments of up to $84 per month.
The aim is for a meme to go viral. That way an ally of a political boss will notice and perhaps slip the creator a bonus, a job or a contract. Popular fake stories include one in which Mr Abubakar had been ""endorsed"" by the Association of Nigerian Gay Men, a fictional entity. Some of the most popular play on existing beliefs. The hilarious idea that Mr Buhari had died and been replaced by a Sudanese man named Jubril seemed credible for many reasons. The president is old and sickly, and one of his predecessors died in office.
Do the fibs get through? Researchers find it hard enough to know how many people see fake news, let alone how many believe it. What is certain, though, is that the truth takes longer to get its boots on. During the elections the Centre for Democracy and Development, a think-tank run by Ms Hassan, employed five fact-checkers who tried to refute dodgy stories. But they were soon overwhelmed by the volume of misinformation. ""I don't think fact-checking makes any difference,"" she sighs.
Nigeria is not the only place where WhatsApp is influencing political culture. Mr Hitchen notes that during elections in Sierra Leone in 2018, stories spread by an urban minority on WhatsApp would find their way onto popular radio talk shows. In Kenyan elections in 2017 ""keyboard warriors"" used the platform to collect the phone numbers of group members and allegedly sell them to political parties.
Such chicanery has been found elsewhere in the world. In Brazil supporters of Jair Bolsonaro used WhatsApp to deliver ""an onslaught of daily misinformation"", says Luca Belli, a law professor at Fundaçao Getulio Vargas, a university in Rio de Janeiro. Partly in response WhatsApp, which was bought by Facebook in 2014, limited to five the number of times a user could forward a message. Previous concerns over its misuse in India prompted WhatsApp to label messages as having been forwarded.
These changes will only have limited effect. ""You can make it harder to share misinformation,"" says Mr Cheeseman. ""But that just means that it takes longer to share-it doesn't make it impossible."" As long as WhatsApp allows the sharing of information in groups, it will be used to share lies as well as truths. The only resilient defence is savvier, more sceptical users.
There are some efforts to use WhatsApp to encourage those. Several were set up ahead of the elections in South Africa on May 8th. One was ""What's Crap on WhatsApp"", an initiative by Africa Check, an NGO with offices in four African countries. It invited South Africans to forward them potential cases of misinformation, which it tried to debunk through one of its WhatsApp channels.
Another is the creation of Sizwe MpofuWalsh, a 30-year-old activist and writer. Eager to produce a political show for young people, he first considered YouTube and radio, but instead launched one via WhatsApp. Mr Mpofu-Walsh uses WhatsApp for Business, the platform's commercial arm, which makes it possible to broadcast to more than the 256-person limit in an ordinary group. It is a format that has proved successful in China (via an app called WeChat) but is rare in Africa (or anywhere, really). He produces five shows every week. They have about 10,000 viewers, not far off what a cable news show gets in South Africa. ""There is an intimacy to WhatsApp that makes people ready to listen to a message,"" says Mr Mpofu-Walsh. That is why the platform is popular. But it is also what can make it dangerous.","Social media and politics

SÃO PAULO
Jair Bolsonaro is breaking his main campaign promise
IF THERE is one thing voters wanted from Jair Bolsonaro when they elected him Brazil's president last October it was to end corruption. When he was a right-wing congressional backbencher, his fulminations against ""os corruptos"" helped make him famous. In his inauguration speech on January 1st he promised to ""free the country from the yoke of corruption"".
Now, his plans to keep his most important campaign promise are failing. That is because his administration looks nearly as scandal-prone as the one it replaced. One of his sons, Flávio, a senator from Rio de Janeiro (pictured left), is being investigated for money-laundering. Messages leaked to the Intercept, an investigative news website, have damaged the reputation of Sérgio Moro, the justice minister, who is in charge of fighting corruption and crime. They show that Mr Moro collaborated improperly with prosecutors when he was the judge in charge of the vast Lava Jato anti-corruption investigation. The operation led to the jailing of more than 100 businessmen and several politicians, including Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, a former president.
The tourism minister is being investigated for putting up female paper candidates in congressional and state elections to get campaign funds meant for them. Mr Bolsonaro nominated another son, Eduardo, to be Brazil's ambassador to the United States, adding nepotism to his administration's list of sins.
The president can claim some successes, including progress on economic reform. He broke with past presidents' practice of giving cabinet jobs in exchange for support in congress. So far, that is his only contribution to cleaner politics.
A low point came on July 16th, when Dias Toffoli, a justice on the supreme court, suspended the investigation of Flávio Bolsonaro. Police had identified an ""exceptional increase"" in his net worth tied to property deals between 2014 and 2017, when he was a state congressman. Seven million reais ($2m) passed without explanation through the bank account of his driver, a friend of the president.
Mr Toffoli ruled that prosecutors need permission from a judge to use financial data collected by COAF, the government financial-intelligence unit, and other agencies. The supreme court has been considering since 2017 whether to issue such a ruling. It is due to decide in November this year. Mr Toffoli acted on his own after Flávio's lawyers joined the suit. The ruling throws anti-corruption investigations into a ""state of instability and confusion"", says Silvana Batini, a Lava Jato prosecutor from Rio de Janeiro. It could also hinder probes of money-laundering by drug gangs.
The president welcomed the decision to suspend the case against his son. Otherwise he has gone quiet on corruption. In the second half of 2018 he tweeted 68 times about corruption, according to the Electronic Government Laboratory at the University of Brasilia. The number of tweets dropped to 20 in the first half of this year. In July there has so far been none.
Mr Moro, weakened by the leaks, has said nothing about Mr Toffoli's decision. An anti-crime and corruption measure he proposed is making little progress. The committee responsible for it in the lower house of congress has voted down one idea to punish wrongdoing: writing into law the requirement that people convicted of corruption begin their sentences if they lose their first appeals, which does not always happen now.
So far, Brazilians have not noticed that the anti-corruption dream team are failing them. True, Mr Bolsonaro's approval rating of 33% in early July was the lowest since 1990 for any president after six months in office, according to Datafolha, a pollster. But scandals are not the reason. More often, respondents point to the impact of a weak economy, cuts to university budgets and unpresidential behaviour (Mr Bolsonaro recently called governors of poor north-eastern states paraíbas, or ""hicks"").
Embarrassing headlines have not stopped parts of his programme from moving ahead, which was not the case during the presidency of his predecessor, Michel Temer. Mercosur, a group to which Brazil belongs, has reached a trade agreement in principle with the European Union (see Bello). A reform of pensions is advancing.
If the corruption fight is to resume, prosecutors say, both the supreme court and the president will have to change course. Prosecutors hope that the court will reverse Mr Toffoli's decision, unblocking investigations into Flávio and other alleged wrongdoers. Progress will depend partly on whom Mr Bolsonaro chooses to succeed Raquel Dodge as Brazil's attorneygeneral in September. Mr Bolsonaro has waffled about whether he will pick one of the three candidates proposed by the National Association of Prosecutors. That practice began in 2003 as a way of ensuring the attorney-general's independence from politics. Mr Bolsonaro's choice will be ""a big test of the government's commitment"" to fight corruption, says Bruno Brandăo of Transparency International, an NGO.
Despite its flaws, Lava Jato offered the hope that Brazil might end the culture of impunity that allowed corruption to flourish. The question now is whether that quest can overcome the damage inflicted on it by its biggest champions.","Jair Bolsonaro is breaking Jair Bolsonaro's main campaign promise

The operation led to the jailing of more than 100 businessmen and several politicians , including Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva , a former president . 
 The tourism minister is being investigated for putting up female paper candidates in congressional and state elections to get campaign funds meant for them . Jair Bolsonaro nominated another son , Eduardo , to be Brazil 's ambassador to the United States , adding nepotism to Jair Bolsonaro's administration 's list of sins . 
 Jair Bolsonaro can claim some successes , including progress on economic reform . Jair Bolsonaro broke with past presidents ' practice of giving cabinet jobs in exchange for support in congress . So far , that is Jair Bolsonaro's only contribution to cleaner politics . 
 A low point came on July 16th , when Dias Toffoli , a justice on the supreme court , suspended the investigation of Flávio Bolsonaro . Police had identified an "" exceptional increase "" in his net worth tied to property deals between 2014 and 2017 , when he was a state congressman . Seven million reais ( $ 2 m ) passed without explanation through the bank account of his driver , a friend of Jair Bolsonaro . 
 Mr Toffoli ruled that prosecutors need permission from a judge to use financial data collected by COAF , the government financial - intelligence unit , and other agencies . The supreme court has been considering since 2017 whether to issue such a ruling . It is due to decide in November this year . Mr Toffoli acted on his own after Flávio 's lawyers joined the suit . The ruling throws anti - corruption investigations into a "" state of instability and confusion "" , says Silvana Batini , a Lava Jato prosecutor from Rio de Janeiro . It could also hinder probes of money - laundering by drug gangs . 
 Jair Bolsonaro welcomed the decision to suspend the case against Jair Bolsonaro's son . Otherwise Jair Bolsonaro has gone quiet on corruption . In the second half of 2018 Jair Bolsonaro tweeted 68 times about corruption , according to the Electronic Government Laboratory at the University of Brasilia . The number of tweets dropped to 20 in the first half of this year . In July there has so far been none . 
 Mr Moro , weakened by the leaks , has said nothing about Mr Toffoli 's decision . An anti - crime and corruption measure Jair Bolsonaro proposed is making little progress . The committee responsible for it in the lower house of congress has voted down one idea to punish wrongdoing : writing into law the requirement that people convicted of corruption begin their sentences if they lose their first appeals , which does not always happen now . 
 So far , Brazilians have not noticed that the anti - corruption dream team are failing them . True , Jair Bolsonaro's approval rating of 33 % in early July was the lowest since 1990 for any president after six months in office , according to Datafolha , a pollster . But scandals are not the reason . More often , respondents point to the impact of a weak economy , cuts to university budgets and unpresidential behaviour ( Jair Bolsonaro recently called governors of poor north - eastern states paraíbas , or "" hicks "" ) . 
 Embarrassing headlines have not stopped parts of Jair Bolsonaro's programme from moving ahead , which was not the case during the presidency of Jair Bolsonaro's predecessor , Michel Temer . Mercosur , a group to which Brazil belongs , has reached a trade agreement in principle with the European Union ( see Bello ) . A reform of pensions is advancing . 
 If the corruption fight is to resume , prosecutors say , both the supreme court and Jair Bolsonaro will have to change course . Prosecutors hope that the court will reverse Mr Toffoli 's decision , unblocking investigations into Flávio and other alleged wrongdoers . Progress will depend partly on whom Jair Bolsonaro chooses to succeed Raquel Dodge as Brazil 's attorneygeneral in September . Jair Bolsonaro has waffled about whether Jair Bolsonaro will pick one of the three candidates proposed by the National Association of Prosecutors . That practice began in 2003 as a way of ensuring Jair Bolsonaro's independence from politics . Jair Bolsonaro's choice will be "" a big test of the government 's commitment "" to fight corruption , says Bruno Brandăo of Transparency International , an NGO . 
 Despite its flaws , Lava Jato offered the hope that Brazil might end the culture of impunity that allowed corruption to flourish . The question now is whether that quest can overcome the damage inflicted on it by its biggest champions .",140,Brazil,ctb-140-2,IN TERM,True,"Brazil

TO THE OUTSIDER Latin America has long appeared to form an unquestionable part of the zone of influence of the United States. In fact, that has applied mainly to the Caribbean basin, not to the vast area south of the greatest geographical barrier in the Americas, the Amazon rainforest. As long ago as the 1940s Nicholas Spykman of Yale University identified Brazil and Argentina, the main countries in what is now the Mercosur trade bloc, as ""the equidistant zone"": as far from New York as from Lisbon and as open to European as to yanqui influence. Even today, although the United States is the main trading partner of Latin America as a whole, Mercosur (which includes Paraguay and Uruguay) does nearly half as much trade again with the European Union.
In recent decades European interest in Latin America, and vice versa, has been fitful. In 1999 the first EU-Latin America summit, held in Rio de Janeiro, proclaimed a ""strategic partnership"" but attached no strategies to make that more than a slogan. Latin America was a priority for Europe, but beneath many others, so it wasn't. Left-wing governments in South America preferred ""south-south co-operation"" to ties with Europe. The lack of serious intent was summed up by 20-year on-off talks for a trade agreement between the EU and Mercosur.
That this was successfully concluded last month has significance that goes well beyond the agreement itself. Provided it is ratified, it will offer benefits especially to European manufacturers and to Mercosur farmers. It will be phased in over 15 years, at the end of which it will have eliminated tariffs on over 90% of goods traded between the blocs, with tariff-free quotas for the remainder. It also opens up services and public procurement in Mercosur and, in effect, commits Brazil's environmentally unfriendly president, Jair Bolsonaro, both to the Paris agreement to combat climate change (which he had wanted to leave) and to curbing deforestation of the Amazon.
Just as important is the potential stimulus to reforming Mercosur's economies and to regional integration within Latin America. Brazil and Argentina are among the world's most closed economies. That is now likely to change. To take advantage of the EU agreement, they will have to lighten burdensome taxes and regulations and boost internal transport infrastructure. After rule by protectionist left-wingers, both now have governments that want to open up economically. Mercosur's presidents this month said they want swiftly to reach trade agreements with Canada and the EFTA bloc, which includes Switzerland and Norway. The EU agreement ""is not a point of arrival but of departure,"" declared Mauricio Macri, Argentina's president. A more open, business-friendly Mercosur would in turn ease regulatory convergence with Latin America's other big trading group, the Pacific Alliance.
The long-awaited breakthrough reflects bigger changes. Both sides worry about the trade war and the geopolitical conflict between China and Donald Trump's United States. China is now Mercosur's largest single trade partner (and the second-biggest for Latin America as a whole). Although the EU remains the largest investor in Latin America, Chinese investments and loans to the region have grown fast. China's growing influence there is of concern not just to Mr Trump, but to Europe and Japan, too. The prospect of being squeezed between Mr Trump and China scares many Latin American leaders.
The Mercosur agreement is part of a broader European reassessment of Latin America. Both regions share a commitment to democracy and multilateralism, values that are on the defensive. In that sense, ""though far apart geographically, we are closer than any other continents,"" Federica Mogherini, the Eu's outgoing foreign-policy chief, stated in April. She unveiled a new policy statement aimed at achieving greater political co-operation between the two regions. This contains a healthy dose of realism. Having previously sought to work with Latin America mainly through celac, a comatose and divided 33-country outfit, the European Commission will now give priority to co-operating with smaller and more coherent groups.
Much can still go wrong. Ratification of the Mercosur accord by Europe's national parliaments will take up to two years and will not be easy. If Mr Macri loses a presidential election in October, Argentina could pull out. Above all, distance and the press of other priorities may cause each side to lose interest once again. That would be a strategic error.","Latin America has much to gain from closer ties with Europe

A GOOD WAY to start an argument that never ends is to try to define populism. Dictionaries say it is politics directed at ordinary people who feel neglected by elites. That leaves a lot out, not least economics. In 1990 Sebastian Edwards and the late Rudiger Dornbusch sketched what is meant by ""economic populism"". It is an approach, they wrote, that denies that budget deficits or inflation are constraints on economic growth. The Latin American populists they studied printed money to pay for public-spending binges. It ended in tears.
There is no shortage of leaders in middle-income countries who fit the dictionary definition of a populist. But economic populism in its purest form is now quite rare (though its results are sadly evident in Venezuela). These days a lot of would-be champions of the people prefer their macroeconomic policies on the orthodox side: inflation targets, fiscal restraints, free-floating currencies, that sort of thing. They are happy to let technocrats get on with it.
This poses a mild dilemma for richworld investors-which is soon resolved. They may be appalled by the social and foreign policies of such strongmen. Yet as professionals they are also unthrilled by inflation, default, devaluation and adverse shifts in politics, which are hazardous to a bond portfolio. They tend to favour autocrats who like technocrats. You might call it the Putin Principle.
Russia's president, Vladimir Putin, is not much loved in the West. Buttressed by suppression at home and military adventures abroad, he is the archetypal strongman. He combines this with an affinity for well-qualified economists. His finance ministry frames the budget by a conservative fiscal rule. Inflation is under control, helped by fairly high interest rates. The central bank's governor, Elvira Nabiullina, is widely admired.
What pulls investors in or puts them off is hard to pin down. It is never a single factor; the world is more complex than that. But a currency's value is a clue to general sentiment, because it is a shadow price of a country's assets relative to everybody else's. The rouble is one of the best-performing currencies this year (see chart). Just as telling is that countries led by strongmen hostile to orthodox policies have seen their currencies suffer-the inverse of the Putin Principle. Recep Tayyip Erdogan, president of Turkey, is the exemplar. For years he has bullied the central bank. Earlier this month he sacked its governor for keeping interest rates high. The lira has suffered badly.
Other countries can be paired on the Putin-Erdogan scale. Take Egypt and Pakistan. The army looms over both. Under the IMF's auspices, Egypt has followed orthodox policies. The Egyptian pound has risen. Pakistan lost its policy discipline as soon as its most recent IMF programme ended (though it has just signed up to another one). The rupee is down.
The populist label also fits both Jair Bolsonaro of Brazil and Andrés Manuel López Obrador of Mexico. But when Mr Bolsonaro was elected, investors sensed that he might defer to technocratic advisers such as Paulo Guedes, now his economy minister, who has a doctorate in economics from the University of Chicago. Sure enough, Mr Bolsonaro recently shepherded through Brazil's lower house a pension reform that is vital to the country's fiscal stability. The real rallied. Meanwhile, Mr López Obrador's finance minister abruptly resigned. He complained bitterly that technocrats had been sidelined in favour of unqualified types. The peso wobbled.
The leader who is hardest to place on the scale is Narendra Modi of India. He has all the elements of a strongman: strident nationalism, personality cult, enfeebled opposition. He appears to value technocrats. As prime minister and, before that, as chief minister of Gujarat, he has relied on a small band of trusted civil servants. And though he is no fiscal hawk, he seems to grasp that the budget has limits. But there are marks against him. He lost two well-regarded central-bank governors in his first term as prime minister. His madcap idea to withdraw banknotes from circulation in 2016 was anything but orthodox.
The autocrat-plus-technocrat model is not rock-solid. A frailty is that stability is less valuable if it is not married to policies to promote economic growth. Such reforms often, or usually, founder on vested interests on which the autocrat depends. But if living standards are not growing, there will be demand from voters for old-style economic populism. And that always ends badly.","Why investors favour political strongmen who like orthodox economics

ALTHOUGH ITS cradle is the sparsely wooded savannah, humankind has long looked to forests for food, fuel, timber and sublime inspiration. Still a livelihood for 1.5bn people, forests maintain local and regional ecosystems and, for the other 6.2bn, provide a-fragile and creaking-buffer against climate change. Now droughts, wildfires and other human-induced changes are compounding the damage from chainsaws. In the tropics, which contain half of the world's forest biomass, tree-cover loss has accelerated by two-thirds since 2015; if it were a country, the shrinkage would make the tropical rainforest the world's third-biggest carbon-dioxide emitter, after China and America.
Nowhere are the stakes higher than in the Amazon basin- and not just because it contains 40% of Earth's rainforests and harbours 10-15% of the world's terrestrial species. South America's natural wonder may be perilously close to the tipping-point beyond which its gradual transformation into something closer to steppe cannot be stopped or reversed, even if people lay down their axes. Brazil's president, Jair Bolsonaro, is hastening the process-in the name, he claims, of development. The ecological collapse his policies may precipitate would be felt most acutely within his country's borders, which encircle 80% of the basin- but would go far beyond them, too. It must be averted.
Humans have been chipping away at the Amazon rainforest since they settled there well over ten millennia ago. Since the 1970s they have done so on an industrial scale. In the past 50 years Brazil has relinquished 17% of the forest's original extent, more than the area of France, to road- and dambuilding, logging, mining, soyabean farming and cattle ranching. After a seven-year government effort to slow the destruction, it picked up in 2013 because of weakened enforcement and an amnesty for past deforestation. Recession and political crisis further pared back the government's ability to enforce the rules. Now Mr Bolsonaro has gleefully taken a buzz saw to them. Although congress and the courts have blocked some of his efforts to strip parts of the Amazon of their protected status, he has made it clear that rule-breakers have nothing to fear, despite the fact that he was elected to restore law and order. Because 70-80% of logging in the Amazon is illegal, the destruction has soared to record levels. Since he took office in January, trees have been disappearing at a rate of over two Manhattans a week.
The Amazon is unusual in that it recycles much of its own water. As the forest shrivels, less recycling takes place. At a certain threshold, that causes more of the forest to wither so that, over a matter of decades, the process feeds on itself. Climate change is bringing the threshold closer every year as the forest heats up. Mr Bolsonaro is pushing it towards the edge. Pessimists fear that the cycle of runaway degradation may kick in when another 3-8% of the forest vanishes-which, under Mr Bolsonaro, could happen soon. There are hints the pessimists may be correct (see Briefing). In the past 15 years the Amazon has suffered three severe droughts. Fires are on the rise.
Brazil's president dismisses such findings, as he does science more broadly. He accuses outsiders of hypocrisy-did rich countries not fell their own forests?-and, sometimes, of using environmental dogma as a pretext to keep Brazil poor. ""The Amazon is ours,"" the president thundered recently. What happens in the Brazilian Amazon, he thinks, is Brazil's business.
Except it isn't. A ""dieback"" would directly hurt the seven other countries with which Brazil shares the river basin. It would reduce the moisture channelled along the Andes as far south as Buenos Aires. If Brazil were damming a real river, not choking off an aerial one, downstream nations could consider it an act of war. As the vast Amazonian store of carbon burned and rotted, the world could heat up by as much as 0.1°C by 2100-not a lot, you may think, but the preferred target of the Paris climate agreement allows further warming of only 0.5°C or so.
Mr Bolsonaro's other arguments are also flawed. Yes, the rich world has razed its forests. Brazil should not copy its mistakes, but learn from them instead as, say, France has, by reforesting while it still can. Paranoia about Western scheming is just that. The knowledge economy values the genetic information sequestered in the forest more highly than land or dead trees. Even if it did not, deforestation is not a necessary price of development. Brazil's output of soyabeans and beef rose between 2004 and 2012, when forest-clearing slowed by 80%. In fact, aside from the Amazon itself, Brazilian agriculture may be deforestation's biggest victim. The drought of 2015 caused maize farmers in the central Brazilian state of Mato Grosso to lose a third of their harvest.
For all these reasons, the world ought to make clear to Mr Bolsonaro that it will not tolerate his vandalism. Food companies, pressed by consumers, should spurn soyabeans and beef produced on illegally logged Amazonian land, as they did in the mid-2000s. Brazil's trading partners should make deals contingent on its good behaviour. The agreement reached in June by the EU and Mercosur, a South American trading bloc of which Brazil is the biggest member, already includes provisions to protect the rainforest. It is overwhelmingly in the parties' interest to enforce them. So too for China, which is anxious about global warming and needs Brazilian agriculture to feed its livestock. Rich signatories of the Paris agreement, who pledged to pay developing ones to plant carbon-consuming trees, ought to do so. Deforestation accounts for 8% of global greenhouse-gas emissions but attracts only 3% of the aid earmarked for combating climate change.
The wood and the trees
If there is a green shoot in Mr Bolsonaro's scorched-earth tactics towards the rainforest, it is that they have made the Amazon's plight harder to ignore-and not just for outsiders. Brazil's agriculture minister urged Mr Bolsonaro to stay in the Paris agreement. Unchecked deforestation could end up hurting Brazilian farmers if it leads to foreign boycotts of Brazilian farm goods. Ordinary Brazilians should press their president to reverse course. They have been blessed with a unique planetary patrimony, whose value is intrinsic and life-sustaining as much as it is commercial. Letting it perish would be a needless catastrophe.","Brazil has the power to save Earth 's greatest rainforest - or destroy it

The world's largest rainforest is approaching the point of its irreversible destruction
THE AMAZON basin, most of which sits within the borders of Brazil, contains 40% of the world's tropical forests and accounts for 10-15% of the biodiversity of Earth's continents. Since the 1970s nearly 800,000km2 of Brazil's original 4m km2 (1.5m square miles) of Amazon forest has been lost to logging, farming, mining, roads, dams and other forms of development-an area equivalent to that of Turkey, and bigger than that of Texas. Over the same period, the average temperature in the basin has risen by about 0.6°C. This century, the region has suffered a series of severe droughts.
Both the reduction in tree coverage and the change in climate were endangering the forest's future well before Brazil's general elections of October 2018. But after that the forest faced another threat: Jair Bolsonaro, the new president, and arguably the most environmentally dangerous head of state in the world.
From 2004 to 2012 the rate of deforestation in the Brazilian Amazon slowed. The government's environmental protection agency, Ibama, was strengthened. Other countries, and global NGOs, nagged and encouraged; in 2008 an international Amazon Fund was created to help pay for protection. Not a moment too soon, said rainforest scientists. They had begun to suspect that, if tree loss passed a certain threshold, the deforestation would start to feed on itself. Beyond this tipping-point, forest cover would keep shrinking whatever humans might try to do to stop it. Eventually much of the basin would be drier savannah, known as cerrado. As well as spelling extinction for tens of thousands of species, that devastation would change weather patterns over much of South America and release into the atmosphere tens of billions of tonnes of carbon, worsening global warming.
This hopeful period of slower deforestation was not to last. Even before Mr Bolsonaro, deforestation began to tick up (see chart 1, on next page). In 2012, under thenpresident Dilma Rousseff, Brazil's congress passed a new forest code that gave amnesty to those who had taken part in illegal deforestation before 2008. In 2017 Michel Temer, the next president, signed a law that streamlined the privatisation of occupied public lands, which spurred land grabs in the Amazon. During the deep recession of 2014-16 the environment ministry's budget was slashed. Between August 2017 and July 2018 Brazil lost 7,900km2 of Amazon forest-nearly a billion trees-the highest rate of deforestation for a decade.
Heaven's high canopy
According to preliminary satellite data, since Mr Bolsonaro took office in January, the Amazon has lost roughly 4,300km2 of forest, which means this year's total will surely outstrip last year's. This is not a fluke. The president appears to want the country to return to the time of Brazil's military dictatorship, when big infrastructure projects prompted widespread destruction in the name of development.
A few of Mr Bolsonaro's plans have been curbed. Pressure from Tereza Cristina, the agriculture minister, and the farm lobby led him to withdraw his threat to leave the Paris climate agreement and from abolish- * ing the environment ministry-mostly because deals with disapproving European firms would be at risk. A bill introduced by Flávio Bolsonaro, the president's eldest son and a senator in his own right, to eliminate a requirement for farmers to preserve some natural vegetation on land they clear has not yet passed. The supreme court blocked a decree to transfer powers over the demarcation of indigenous reserves from the justice ministry to Ms Cristina's-which would have ""put the fox in charge of the chicken coop,"" argues Randolfe Rodrigues, an opposition senator.
But even without the biggest changes, Mr Bolsonaro's government can still encourage, directly or indirectly, a large amount of deforestation, by not enforcing the laws that prohibit it. On February 28th the environment minister, Ricardo Salles, fired 21 of Ibama's 27 state heads, following the president's orders to ""clean out"" the agency. Most have yet to be replaced, including all but one in the Amazon states. The environment ministry has started to flag up in advance where and when antilogging operations will take place. Between January and May, Ibama imposed the lowest number of fines for illegal deforestation in a decade.
Mr Salles says that ""the role of the state is to protect landowners' property rights"". He wants to use donations from Norway and Germany to the 3.6bn reais ($95om) Amazon Fund to compensate landowners for land that had been turned into conservation areas, even though most of it was occupied illegally.
Deforesters appear emboldened. According to the Indigenist Missionary Council, a Catholic group, the number of illegal invasions in indigenous areas has jumped. On July 24th miners with guns invaded a village in the northern state of Amapá, killed one of its leaders and expelled the residents. Satellite data show a drastic rise in the year-on-year deforestation rate starting in May, the beginning of the dry season. In July, more than 1,800km2 was cleared, three times more than last year.
These statistics tell only part of the story. The Amazon matters to the global climate because it is a sink of carbon, mitigating warming. If the rainforest were to die back, the large amount of greenhouse gases this would release would speed up that process. But the climate matters to the Amazon, too. It is sensitive to changes in temperature and rainfall, as well as to atmospheric carbon-dioxide levels.
The Amazon is unique among tropical rainforests in that it produces a lot of its own rainfall. As moisture travels from the Atlantic to Peru, the Amazon's trees recycle some of it; around half the forest's rain is reused this way. Rainwater is pulled up from the roots to the canopy, where it is released back to the atmosphere to fall as rain again. Not only does this provide moisture to the region, the evaporation off the leaves also has a local cooling effect.
This is what has led to worries about tipping-points. In an influential paper in 2007 Gilvan Sampaio and Carlos Nobre of Brazil's National Institute for Space Research forecast that, were 40% of the forest to perish, the loss of water-recycling capacity would mean very little of the rest would have enough rainfall to survive.
Trees rudely hollowed
Alongside the threat from deforestation, the forest's capacity to water itself can be weakened by rising temperatures. Beatriz Marimon and Ben Hur Marimon, at the University of Mato Grosso in Nova Xavantina, have kept tabs for decades on dozens of plots in the transiçâo, the margin between the wet Amazon and the drier cerrado. Today, Mr Marimon says, they are seeing ""two warmings in one"". On top of global warming are changes that result from deforestation, which removes the air-conditioning effect provided by water evaporating from the trees' leaves.
A study by Divino Silvério and colleagues at the Amazon Environmental Research Institute, published in 2015, found that converting forest to pasture increased land temperatures by 4.3°C; if pasture was then turned over to arable crops, things warmed a little more. The transiçâo is already hotter and drier than most of the rainforest. Clearing more of its patchwork of forest, farms and savannah makes the remaining woodland even hotter.
Ms Marimon has also observed that temperatures above 40°C dry out trees, making them more likely to fall in strong winds. The fragmentation brought about by farming creates isolated patches of forest. If they lose access to seed banks in the soil and water sources, such disconnected fragments are less able to recover.
How plants respond to carbon-dioxide levels probably exacerbates matters. The more carbon dioxide in the air, the less air plants need to process in order to photosynthesise. The less air they take in, the less water vapour they let out. As a consequence, the plants both do less to cool their immediate environment (because less water evaporates) and also make the atmosphere less moist. This has been shown to be happening in other watersheds, though there is not yet conclusive evidence from the Amazon.
Clearances also lead to local drying. Satellite data show that air which passes over primary rainforest produces twice as much rain a few days later than that which passes over farmland. In 2012 scientists at the University of Leeds predicted that continued deforestation would cause rainfall in the Amazon to drop by 12% in the wet season and by 21% in the dry season by 2050. 1
* The forest's dry season started to lengthen in the 1970s; the rains which used to come in October now come in November. This might have been an effect of deforestation; there is some evidence that water returned to the atmosphere by trees is particularly important in getting the rainy season going. The most dramatic effect of drying seen by scientists, though, is not a shorter wet season. It is the disproportionate impact of the years in which rainfall is particularly low.
This century has already seen three unusually harsh droughts, in 2005, 2010 and 2015. That of 2015 corresponds to an El Niño event-a see-saw effect in Earth's climate whereby a shift in the flow of energy between the atmosphere and the ocean in the central Pacific produces a predictable pattern of climate anomalies all through the tropics and beyond (see chart 2). The correlation between El Niño events and droughts in the Amazon, most notably in the south-eastern part, predates human activities. But those activities may, at a global level, increase the frequency and intensity of El Niño events. At the local level they worsen the damage that droughts do.
The El Niño drought in 2015 was particularly severe. In Nova Xavantina more than a third of the trees in some of the Marimons' study plots died in its aftermath. The region around the city of Santarém, farther north and deep in the Amazon, saw flames as tall as buildings tear through the forest, enveloping the canopy in thick black smoke that stretched for miles and turned the sunlight red. For months after the fires died down, the forest floor smouldered. Hundred-year-old trees dried out and died.
Nearly four years later, the forest is still recovering. At one part of the Tapajós National Forest reserve, where 580km2 (11% of the total area) burned, saplings have shot up among the ashes of their giant forebears, but it will be years before they form a canopy. A second round of fires in 2017 burned nearly a quarter of another reserve, where 75 communities of river-dwellers make their living fishing and hunting.
Fires are not new to the Amazon, but recently they seem to have been more frequent and intense. This kicks off a vicious cycle. Dead trees open gaps in the canopy, allowing more light and wind to reach the forest floor, which becomes hotter, drier and more prone to burn again. This year is expected to be a mild El Niño year, which means higher temperatures and less rain for the area around Santarém. Fires could rage again. If that happens, says Joice Ferreira, a biologist at the Brazilian Agricultural Research Corporation, the debris left over from the previous fires will serve as fuel for the flames. ""After that,"" she says, ""there won't be many trees left.""
Over the past 50 years 17% of the rainforest has been lost, some way from the 40% tipping-point proposed in 2007. But last year Mr Nobre and Thomas Lovejoy of George Mason University, after taking account of climate change and fire as well as deforestation, revised the estimate of the threshold to 20-25%. That is uncomfortably close to today's figure. Mr Nobre says the recent droughts and floods could be the ""first flickers"" of permanent change. Carlos Rittl of the Brazilian Climate Observatory, a consortium of research outfits, expects Mr Bolsonaro's tenure to see deforestation pass 20%. If Mr Lovejoy and Mr Nobre are right, that could be disastrous-once the tipping-point is transgressed, much of the rest of the forest could follow in just a matter of decades.
To shade the barren wild
Even now, the service that the Amazon provides the rest of the world as a sink for carbon dioxide appears to be declining. Simon Lewis of University College London, and colleagues, analysed observations of 321 plots across the Amazon basin. They found that in primary forests plants absorb, on average, a third less carbon dioxide than they did in the 1990s, owing to increasing tree mortality. In a paper published in 2011 Mr Lewis argued that carbon lost to the atmosphere through tree death and fire in the droughts of 2005 and 2010 might offset as much as a decade's worth of carbon-dioxide absorption by the forest.
Not everyone is so gloomy. Forests that are diverse, like the Amazon, are likely to have drought-resistant species that can fill the niche left by drought-prone ones without a loss of biomass, points out Kirsten Thonicke of the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research, a German thinktank. Secondary forests store significant amounts of carbon, though far less than primary ones. One study found that as a secondary forest grows, it recovers 1.2% carbon storage per year, so a 20-year-old secondary forest would store roughly 25% of the carbon stored by a primary forest. There are ways to mitigate the biomass loss from logging and ranching, by being careful about which trees to cut and reforesting afterwards. In Paris Brazil pledged not just to halt illegal deforestation by 2030 but also to reforest 120,000km2.
Such attempts at mitigation look increasingly unlikely. In June Mr Bolsonaro published a decree which indefinitely extends the 2019 deadline for farmers to begin replanting illegally deforested land. This not only reduces the chances of reforestation. It reinforces the message: the government will turn a blind eye to more. Similarly, if his son's bill were to pass it would legalise the deforestation of some 1.5m km2. Clearing that would emit nearly 65bn tonnes of carbon dioxide-equivalent to Brazil's emissions over the past 27 years.
In July President Bolsonaro called deforestation data ""lies"" and said he wanted to review them before they were released to the public. Hamilton Mourāo, the vicepresident, says that other countries' professed concern for the Amazon masks ""covetousness"" for precious minerals in the region. Mr Salles, the environment minister, likes to point out that many rich countries cut down their own forests but have not fulfilled promises to pay Brazil not to do the same. ""You can't give Brazil the onus of being the world's lungs without any benefits,"" he argues.
The trees stood bare
Mr Salles is right that the countries responsible for the bulk of emissions should compensate Brazil for its role in absorbing them. In return Brazil must protect, rather than destroy, the rainforest. In June a trade deal between the EU and Mercosur-Brazil, Argentina, Paraguay and Uruguay-was announced at the G20 summit, which includes a commitment to implement the Paris climate agreement. It has yet to be approved; it is also unclear how much it will sway the president to curb his infrastructure plans, or indeed his rhetoric.
Concerns about what Brazil's climate policies might do to the country's reputation could spur local resistance to Mr Bolsonaro's anti-environmental turn. Fears for the climate itself may yet do more. ""We have no doubt that the forest has a direct effect on the rain cycle,"" says Artemizia Moita, the sustainability director of a farming group that has 530km2 of soyabean and cattle farms. ""If we keep deforesting,"" she asks, ""how will we keep producing?"" Unlike other farmers she admits she is worried about climate change.
For many, any shift in attitudes will already come too late. Magdalena is an elderly woman who has spent her life as a riverdweller in one of the rainforest's reserves. She used to hunt deer and armadillo to make her living. Now she treks 13km to buy beef from a local village. ""All the game is gone,"" she laments.","NOVA XAVANTINA AND SANTARÉM

Published in 2014, ""Nothing is True and Everything is Possible"" is a memoir of working in Russia's television industry in the 2000s. During his first meeting in Moscow in 2006, Mr Pomerantsev, then a producer-director, now a fellow at the London School of Economics, listens to one of the country's top TV presenters declare: ""We all know there will be no real politics. But we still have to give our viewers the sense that something is happening."" The question is, ""Who's the enemy this week?"" Politics should feel ""like a movie!""
That book was acclaimed as a searing insight into the semiotics of Vladimir Putin's Russia. But in the era of Brexit, Donald Trump and Cambridge Analytica, of Rodrigo Duterte and Jair Bolsonaro, the ruses it depicts are eerily recognisable: the spurious storylines and made-up enemies, the redefinition of what constitutes a fact, the wholesale manipulation of the citizenry. Even the title (adapted from Hannah Arendt) seems as applicable to today's social-media-inflected Western world as to the Russia of a decade ago.
Now the author has updated his analysis for the current moment. In ""This is Not Propaganda"", Mr Pomerantsev asks: what if Russia ""had been a pre-echo of what was to come""? In answering that question he ranges from identity politics to the disavowal of objectivity in much of the media; from the distressingly familiar online harassment of Filipino journalists to the ""information war blitzkrieg"" that accompanied the Russian invasion of Ukraine. This time his beat extends across Europe to China, the Americas and the Middle East, letting him draw helpful connections between dispersed but similar battles in ""the war against reality"".
""Nothing is True"" was the account of an insider. Here, Mr Pomerantsev plays the more traditional role of a researcher and reporter. He meets information-age mountebanks and the idealists attempting to resist or expose them. He describes in detail how social media have been weaponised by the bad guys, though he neglects to tease out the influence of would-be good guys: optimistic tech types keen on making the world a better place. He shows how the digital tools used to mobilise peaceful revolutions have been co-opted by autocrats.
The personal experience on which Mr Pomerantsev draws for this book is partly vicarious, as he movingly weaves the story of his parents, Igor and Lina, into his narrative. As dissidents in Soviet Ukraine, they lived under claustrophobic censorship and the constant fear of arrest and interrogation; eventually they were exiled for possessing and circulating samizdat. They moved to London (via Austria and Germany), where Igor worked for the BBC's Russian service, revelling in the freedom to say and think what he wanted.
The contrast between the tight regulation of information by repressive regimes in the 20th century, and the free-for-all of today's media environment, gives the book its disconcerting force. Once authoritarian states concentrated on suppressing unwelcome news and opinions; now some also flood the zone with a million different takes. Once they pushed a monolithic ideology; now they shape-shift, so nobody knows what they stand for. In the past, propaganda often complemented military action; now fighting may be necessary only to provide images for propaganda.
""If you can't convince them, confuse them,"" is an old political motto. But the means for doing that so cheaply and widely are new. If politics in the television age had to feel like a movie, the trick now is to make it seem like an account of real life.","The disinformation age A world of lies This is Not Propaganda.

Vitoria
One Brazilian state stands out as a model of efficiency
THE MOQUECA in Espirito Santo, a state of 4m people on the coast of south-eastern Brazil, is lighter than the fish stew in Bahia, its neighbour to the north, explains a tuxedoed waiter in the capital, Vitória. Capixabas, as Espirito Santo residents are called, like it that way. Their beaches are smaller than those of Rio de Janeiro, to the south; their colonial towns plainer than those of Minas Gerais, to the west. Once considered signs of inferiority, these now seem like symbols of frugality. Other states are so indebted they cannot pay salaries, but Espírito Santo's accounts are in order.
That is thanks largely to the last governor, Paulo Hartung, who ran the state from 2003 to 2010 and then again from 2015 to last year. Mr Hartung stood in 2014 on an austerity platform, arguing that ""spending is taking the elevator while revenue is taking the stairs"". On taking office he set about shrinking spending by 14%. His work means that Espírito Santo is now a model for other Brazilian states to follow.
Brazil's fiscal incontinence is legendary. The number of civil servants grew by 60% between 1995 and 2016, to 12m. Since public-sector workers cannot be fired or have their pay cut, they become a permanent expense once hired. Perks such as raises for seniority can even extend to widows' pensions, producing the unique ""post-mortem promotion"". Nearly 80% of government spending in Brazil goes on salaries and pensions, compared with a global average of 50-60%. ""Instead of a state that serves the public, you have a state that serves the state,"" says Samuel Pessôa of the Brazilian Institute of Economics at Fundaçao Getúlio Vargas, a university.
These days the crisis is worst at the state level. The 27 states' combined pensions shortfall alone is growing by 140bn reais ($35bn) a year, more than that of the federal government. The deficit has doubled in the past five years. Seven states already do not have enough cash to pay salaries; 12 more are close.
Under Dilma Rousseff, Brazil's president from 2011 to 2015, states like Rio de Janeiro depended on treasury-guaranteed loans from state banks to keep spending. But Brazil's new president, Jair Bolsonaro, has promised to reduce the size of the state. His treasury head, Mansueto Almeida, has made debt relief conditional on efforts to comply with a fiscal-responsibility lawpassed in 2000 but long ignored-that restricts spending on personnel.
So how has Espírito Santo stayed in the black? One thing that sets the state apart was foresight about the depth of Brazil's worst-ever recession, which began in 2014. Other governors believed the then president Ms Rousseff, who promised a quick recovery. ""We underestimated the size of the crisis,"" admits Julio Bueno, the treasury secretary in Rio de Janeiro at the time. Brazil's GDP fell by 3.8% in 2015 and by 3.6% in 2016. Rio ended up with a budget deficit of 11bn reais. Espirito Santo finished both years with a surplus.
Boldness is the second thing that sets Espirito Santo apart. ""Fiscal adjustment is a cake recipe not a silver bullet,"" says Mr Hartung. It can easily go wrong. As well as cutting budgets, including for the judiciary and legislature, he had to stand up to the unions, announcing the salary freeze on his first day. Even when two years later police officers went on strike, and 200 were murdered, Mr Hartung did not back down.
Finally, Espírito Santo was better placed to downsize. Its bureaucracy includes a large share of temporary workers, including roughly 60% of teachers. Unlike civil servants, they can be fired. Mr Hartung eliminated more than 7,000 positions, or roughly 12% of the bureaucracy. In Rio de Janeiro less than 3% of government workers are temporary.
Austerity has been painful. Sergio Majeski, a state congressman who opposed the fiscal adjustment, says that cuts to public investment made it harder to climb out of recession. But despite laying off teachers and closing schools, Espirito Santo jumped from 9th place to 1st on a nationwide secondary school exam between 2013 and 2017. Mr Majeski says this is because weaker students began skipping classes. But according to Marco Aurélio Villela, the director of a government school in Vitória, teachers on short-term contracts tend to perform better because they know they can be sacked.
And cutting staff has helped the state to maintain a relatively high level of investment. According to a study by Brazil's treasury, three states that limited spending on salaries-Espírito Santo, Alagoas and Ceará-were able to invest, on average, 304 reais per person in 2018. Rio de Janeiro, Minas Gerais and Rio Grande do Sul, the states deepest in debt, only spent 91 reais.
Can other states emulate Espírito Santo? It will be difficult without changes to federal laws. Mr Bolsonaro's pension reform, working its way through congress, may only apply to federal workers. The supreme court will soon decide whether to allow indebted states to reduce civil servants' salaries and hours. That would provide some relief, as would a bill to allow people to be sacked for persistent poor performance. But most politicians will balk at unpopular cuts. A pilot project led by Ana Carla Abrăo, an economist at Oliver Wyman, a consultancy, found that the city of Sāo Paulo could reduce its payroll by 30% without sacking anyone, by paring back perks for all but the best-performing employees. The project was shelved by a new mayor in 2018.
Last year Mr Hartung decided not to run for re-election. It would have sent a better message if he had, and had won, says Cristiane Schmidt, the treasury secretary for Goiás, a state in deep fiscal trouble. Brazilians tend to blame corruption for their economic woes, even though more money is lost to bloated bureaucracy. Whereas Sérgio Moro, a judge, gained international fame for leading the sprawling Lava Jato anti-corruption investigation, few outside of Espírito Santo have heard of Paulo Hartung. That may change as more states find their coffers empty.","Espírito Santo

The Argentine peso shed a quarter of its value against the dollar and its main stockmarket fell by 37%. Investors fear the return of Ms Fernández, whose policies between 2007 and 2015 ruined the economy.
The result was a blow to the incumbent Argentine president, Mauricio Macri. After the poll he announced a number of giveaways to win over voters, including tax cuts, more welfare subsidies and a three-month freeze in petrol prices.
The election of Alejandro Giammattei as Guatemala's president threw doubt on the safe-third-country agreement signed by the outgoing president, Jimmy Morales, with the United States. Under the deal some migrants would seek asylum in Guatemala rather than travelling through Mexico to the American border. Mr Giammattei thinks Guatemala might not be able to honour that commitment.
The nomination by Brazil's president, Jair Bolsonaro, of his son, Eduardo, as ambassador to the United States prompted the public prosecutor's office to ask a federal court to rule on the formal qualifications required to be a diplomat. Eduardo Bolsonaro's appointment must still be confirmed by the senate in Brasília, but that hasn't stopped the opposition from crying foul, saying his only diplomatic credentials seem to be that he is a friend of the Trump family.

Two treatments for Ebola proved to be effective in tests conducted in the Democratic Republic of Congo, where the latest outbreak has killed 1,900 people. The survival rate jumps to 90% if the treatments, which employ special antibodies, are given soon after infection. If untreated, most people who catch Ebola die.
Southern separatists in Yemen seized the city of Aden from forces loyal to the internationally recognised government.

Mystery surrounded an explosion in Russia's far north, which led to a spike in radiation in nearby towns. The Russians said only that a rocket had exploded, killing five scientists. Analysts think it may have been a Skyfall, a cruise missile powered by a tiny nuclear reactor that the Russians are developing.
Another huge weekend protest, this one the biggest yet, was held in Moscow in opposition to the authorities' decision to bar certain candidates from contesting elections to the city council. The demonstration had been authorised, but police still beat up many of those taking part.
John Bolton, Donald Trump's national security adviser, visited Boris Johnson, the new British prime minister, in London. Mr Bolton held out the prospect of a quick trade deal, negotiated sector by sector (to placate those worried by American designs on Britain's health service) in the case of a no-deal Brexit. But a few days later Nancy Pelosi, the Democratic Speaker of Congress, again scotched any hope of a deal if Britain reinstates border controls with Ireland post-Brexit.

Chinese state media adopted a harsher tone against the protesters in Hong Kong, warning that they were ""asking for self-destruction"". Video footage was released purporting to show manoeuvres by Chinese troops near the border with Hong Kong. China described the demonstrations as ""behaviour that is close to terrorism"". Hundreds of flights in and out of Hong Kong were again cancelled when protesters occupied its airport.
America's envoy to Afghanistan described the latest round of peace talks with the Taliban as ""productive"". The talks, held in Qatar, ended without a deal by which American troops would leave Afghanistan.

A communications blackout was still in force in most of Indian-administered Kashmir following the government's decision to strip the region of its autonomy and split it into two territories that will in effect be controlled from Delhi. Sporadic protests broke out. The biggest took place in Srinagar, Kashmir's main city, where thousands of Muslims took to the streets after Friday prayers.
A former president of Kyrgyzstan, Almazbek Atambayev, was charged with collusion in the early release of a mafia boss. Mr Atambayev has fallen out with his successor and former protégé, Sooronbay Jeyenbekov. Investigators say Mr Atambayev could face other charges, including of murder, after a dramatic siege of his home left a police officer dead.

The Trump administration published a rule that would stop legal migrants from becoming permanent residents in America if they use public-welfare programmes, such as food stamps. Migrants must already prove they will not rely on government assistance if they want to stay. The new rule specifies that receiving certain benefits will be a disqualifying factor. Ken Cuccinelli, who heads the immigration agency, said that America wants ""self-sufficient"" immigrants.

A secret hydropower deal with Brazil causes a political crisis in Paraguay
When brazilian soldiers invaded Paraguay in 1865, after banding together with Argentina and Uruguay, the country lost a quarter of its territory and perhaps 90% of its male population. A century later Brazil sent soldiers to a disputed border region and withdrew only after the two countries agreed to build the world's largest hydro-electric dam.
The dam, named Itaipu, is still a sore subject in Paraguay. Last month it emerged that in May Paraguay's current president, Mario Abdo Benítez, had struck a secret deal with Brazil, further reducing Paraguay's access to cheap power. The resulting outcry has put Mr Abdo Benítez at risk of impeachment. The fiasco has underlined the importance of renegotiating the dam's governing treaty, which expires in 2023.
Under the current agreement, which was signed in 1973, each country has the right to half the dam's output. Paraguay, a country of 7m people with little industry, only uses about a quarter of its share, which fulfils 90% of its electricity needs. It sells the rest to Brazil, which depends on the dam for 15% of its power. But Paraguay is paid only the cost of production (including debt repayments for construction), not the market price of electricity. According to the calculations of Miguel Carter of demos, a think-tank, had Brazil been made to pay full whack, between 1985 and 2018 it would have paid $75.4bn more, or roughly twice Paraguay's current annual gdp.
In 2009 Brazil's then-president, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, agreed to triple Brazil's annual payment and to take steps to allow Paraguay's state power company, ande, to sell directly to private Brazilian companies. But in May's secret deal, a clause that would have made Brazilian companies bid for power was struck out. Paraguay also agreed to receive around 18% less money over the next three years.
The agreement became public in July, when the head of ande, Pedro Ferreira, refused to sign it, resigned and accused Mr Abdo Benítez of ""high treason"". He and Paraguay's minister of foreign relations- who also resigned, along with three other officials-told prosecutors that a ""parallel negotiation"" was under way to sell power exclusively to a Brazilian energy company, Léros. A politician from the party of Brazil's president, Jair Bolsonaro, travelled to Paraguay three times on behalf of Léros.
Mr Ferreira gave text messages to the Paraguayan press purporting to show that an adviser to Paraguay's vice-president, Hugo Velázquez, acting with the knowledge of Mr Abdo Benítez, was arranging meetings with Léros and lobbying on its behalf. In the messages, the adviser, José Rodríguez, claims that the Brazilian politician, Alexandre Giordano, represents not only Léros, but also Mr Bolsonaro's family and the Brazilian government.
The vice-president now denies employing Mr Rodríguez, though he admitted to meeting him to discuss the possibility of Léros buying energy from Paraguay. Mr Ferreira has a different story: he says the vicepresident personally introduced Mr Rodrí- guez as his legal adviser. In one of the text messages, Mr Velázquez asks Mr Ferreira how negotiations for the sale are going.
News of the secret deal prompted thousands of people to take to the streets, calling for Mr Abdo Benítez to be impeached. On August 1st Mr Bolsonaro agreed to scrap the agreement. Proceedings in Paraguay's congress, which had the support of some of the president's allies, were then dropped. But it is too late to stop the outcry about energy policy. In 2023 the $2bn loan taken out to build the dam will at last be paid off. The question is what to do then. ""People on the streets are already talking about the renegotiation [of the deal],"" says Mercedes Canese, a former vice-minister from Frente Guasú, an opposition party.
Many in Paraguay argue that the country should use the excess power itself to industrialise. Drawn by low taxes as well as cheap electricity, car companies have started manufacturing cables in Paraguay to export to Brazil. In Ciudad del Este, just south of the dam, many locals engage in Bitcoin mining, an exceptionally power-hungry business. Demand from homes and offices is growing quickly, too. Within a few decades, Paraguay's half of Itaipu's output ""will go to air-conditioning"", says Christine Folch, the author of ""Hydropolitics"", a forthcoming book about the dam.
At that point, the country will need new energy sources. Until then, however, most of the power will still be sold to Brazil. Brazil's economy is 50 times bigger than that of its landlocked neighbour. And Paraguay's negotiating position is weak. Whereas Mr Bolsonaro put a trio of generals in charge of the Brazilian half of Itaipu, Paraguay does not even have a fully fledged energy ministry. The messages published by Mr Ferreira show how Brazil sets the agenda.
Public pressure may help change that. On August 7th Paraguay's government appointed Geraldo Blanco, an engineering professor with a plan to use more of Itaipu's electricity in Paraguay, to the dam's governing council. As it contemplates its strategy for 2023, Paraguay may look to other smaller countries' battles with big neighbours. In the 1970s a campaign involving the actor John Wayne helped persuade America to pass a law that returned Panama's canal in 1999. As for the businesses best suited to provide the investment needed for Paraguay's industrialisation, they are right over the border in Brazil. ?","Paraguay and power

Under a thick, black cloud at 3pm, the lights flickered on in Sāo Paulo's skyscrapers; on the motorways brake lights started to glow in the city's bumper-to-bumper traffic, and many Paulistanos were worried. Social-media users posted pictures of the gloom, juxtaposing the dystopian afternoon sky with fictional apocalyptic places such as Gotham City from ""Batman"", Mordor from ""Lord of the Rings"" and ""the upside down"" from ""Stranger Things"".
Meteorologists scrambled to explain what was going on. But the most likely explanation, most accept, is that fires burning far away in the rainforest are to blame. Climatempo, a popular private meteorology website, reported that a cold front brought low-lying clouds which then combined with smoke to form the thick black smog. According to the National Institute for Space Research (inpe), forest fires are more common than ever. The number detected so far this year is 84% higher than in the same period last year. Just over half of the fires are in the Amazon.
During the Amazon's dry season, it is common for farmers to set fires illegally to clear land. Brazil's populist president, Jair Bolsonaro, has encouraged them by weakening the agencies that enforce environmental regulations. He holds the view that protecting the forest hinders economic development. When asked about the fires, he ludicrously responded by accusing environmental ngos of setting the fires themselves so as to make his government look bad, in retaliation for his cuts in their funding.
Mr Bolsonaro argues that he is fighting an ""information war"" over the Amazon; he says he wants foreign governments and ngos to stop meddling in Brazil. After inpe released data showing increasing deforestation in July, the president claimed the numbers were fake. He then sacked the head of the agency, Ricardo Magnus Osório Galvāo, a well-respected physicist.
Such belligerence outrages scientists and environmentalists. ""Firing the director is an act of revenge against those who expose the truth,"" says Marcio Astrini of Greenpeace, a pressure group. But the destruction of the rainforest tends to be out of sight, out of mind for a lot of Brazilians, most of whom live in large cities near the coast.

Table talk
Iran's foreign minister, Muhammad Javad Zarif, met President Emmanuel Macron of France on the sidelines of the G7 summit in Biarritz. Mr Macron tried to arrange talks between Donald Trump and Iran's president, Hassan Rouhani. Mr Trump appeared tempted, but Mr Rouhani said there would be no negotiations until American sanctions on Iran are lifted.
Hizbullah threatened to launch a ""surprise"" attack on Israel. The Lebanese militia-cumpolitical party blamed Israel for two drones that crashed in the southern suburbs of Beirut, one of which damaged a Hizbullah office. Separately, Israel said it thwarted an Iranian drone attack with air strikes in Syria.
Sudan's new prime minister, Abdalla Hamdok, said his country needs $8bn in foreign aid over the next two years to fix the crippled economy. Meanwhile, Sudan's newly created sovereign council declared a state of emergency in Port Sudan. Clashes between tribes in the city have killed at least 16 people.
Moving home
The Indonesian government announced that it would relocate the country's capital from Jakarta to the Indonesian part of Borneo. It has selected a site in the province of East Kalimantan and hopes to begin construction next year.
South Korea's supreme court overturned part of an appealscourt verdict in the bribery case of Lee Jae-yong, the de facto boss of Samsung, who had been given a suspended sentence for seeking favours from Park Geun-hye, a former president. It said that the lower court's definition of what constituted bribery was too narrow, and that three expensive horses which Samsung gave to the daughter of the president's confidante were bribes. The ruling is a blow for Mr Lee. The court also ordered a retrial of Ms Park's case. She had been given a 25-year sentence for abusing her power.
A row between Japan and South Korea over compensation for South Koreans forced to work in Japanese factories during the second world war intensified. South Korea pulled out of an intelligence-sharing pact with Japan over its refusal to honour South Korean court rulings. It also conducted military exercises near islands that it controls but Japan claims.
In India, a crackdown on corruption was criticised by some for unfairly targeting political enemies of the ruling bjp party. Police recently arrested a former finance minister under the previous government for influence peddling.

A federal judge blocked Missouri's recently enacted ban on abortions after eight weeks of pregnancy from coming into effect. Similar attempts to restrict abortion were recently obstructed by the courts in Arkansas and Ohio.
Kirsten Gillibrand dropped out of the race to become the Democratic candidate for president, the biggest name to do so, so far. Ms Gillibrand, a senator from New York, had struggled to gain much traction in a crowded field.
Fanning the flames
As fires raged in the Brazilian Amazon, the presidents of Brazil and France directed insults at each other. Emmanuel Macron, the French leader, accused Jair Bolsonaro, his Brazilian counterpart, of lying when he promised to help protect the climate and biodiversity. Mr Bolsonaro decried Mr Macron's ""colonialist stance"". G7 countries offered Brazil $22m to fight the fires. Mr Bolsonaro said he would reject it unless Mr Macron apologised, though he accepted $12m in aid from Britain and sent the armed forces to help fight the blazes.
Ecuador imposed a visa requirement on Venezuelans fleeing the chaos in their country. Migrants now need to carry a passport and show they do not have a criminal record. Chile and Peru have imposed similar restrictions. Thousands of Venezuelans rushed to cross the Ecuadorean border before the rule took effect.
At least 26 people died in a fire at a bar in Coatzacoalcos, a port city on Mexico's east coast. Armed men shut the exits and set fire to the entrance hall.

Emmanuel Macron reclaims France's international role
At the start of this year, a fretful Emmanuel Macron grounded his presidential plane and cleared his diary in order to focus on civil disorder at home. For two months, as he tried to defuse the gilets jaunes (yellow jackets) protests, the French president left Europe only once, shunned global gatherings and ceded the stage to Angela Merkel. Mr Macron's hopes of stepping into the German chancellor's shoes as Europe's leader looked then to be over.
Six months later, the turnaround is startling. For three days starting on August 24th Mr Macron presided over the G7 summit in the seaside resort of Biarritz, an event many expected to be wrecked by conflict and theatrics. Instead, the French host managed to avert disaster, keep America's Donald Trump happy, ease trans-Atlantic tensions over a French tech tax and win a pledge from Mr Trump to talk to Iran's President Hassan Rouhani. He also mobilised a bit of aid for fires in the Amazon, though that fell through in a spat with Jair Bolsonaro, Brazil's president. Mr Trump declared the summit to be ""truly successful"", claimed that ""nobody wanted to leave"" and called Mr Macron a ""spectacular leader"".
The most tantalising outcome was Mr Macron's announcement that a meeting between the American and Iranian presidents could take place in the ""coming weeks"". French diplomats have been working for months on ways to ease tensions with Iran and preserve the principles of the nuclear deal that America signed in 2015, before Mr Trump withdrew and hit Iran with sanctions. On August 25 th Mr Macron pulled off what looked suspiciously like a stunt when he invited Muhammad Javad Zarif, Iran's foreign minister, to Biarritz for bilateral meetings. Yet a day later, there was Mr Trump, standing beside the French president, acknowledging that ""if the circumstances were right"" he would ""certainly agree"" to a meeting with Mr Rouhani.
In the end, nothing came of it. Iran said it wanted sanctions lifted first. And Mr Macron has learned the hard way that efforts to charm and cajole Mr Trump into better behaviour are usually in vain. Last year the American president withdrew from the Iran nuclear deal shortly after Mr Macron visited Washington, hoping to persuade him otherwise.
Indeed Mr Macron's broader diplomatic policy of dialogue with all carries evident risks. His parallel efforts with Russia's Vladimir Putin, whom he invited to the presidential fort on the Mediterranean shortly before the G7 summit, have so far yielded little. The French president has long argued that such leaders are more dangerous when isolated, and is trying instead to mix firmness and flattery. In a speech in Paris on August 27th he called it a ""strategic error"" for Europe to shun Russia, as that pushes it towards China. In the short run Mr Macron hopes to revive peace talks between Russia and Ukraine, supervised by France and Germany. In the long run, he told reporters before the G7 summit, he thinks that a better-behaved Russia should be allowed back into the g8.
Ultimately, France remains a mid-sized power, albeit one with a nuclear deterrent. So Mr Macron's diplomatic space to pursue all these ambitions is limited. This is why the French president spends so much time pushing ideas to strengthen what he calls ""European sovereignty"", or its ability to assert its independence as a strategic and economic bloc. It is also why he sees the diplomatic role he can realistically play as primarily that of a ""mediating power"".
As it happens, Mr Macron may have an unusual opportunity to build on the leadership he displayed in Biarritz. One reason is that, two years after his election, the French president has built up a global address book and got the measure of leaders such as Mr Trump. In Biarritz Mr Macron had an impromptu two-hour seafront lunch ă deux with the American president, peeling him away from his hawkish advisers. ""Lunch with Emmanuel was the best meeting we have yet had,"" Mr Trump gushed afterwards on Twitter. In a joint press conference the usually verbose French president was careful to use short words, and appear respectful. ""Macron is very clear about their differences,"" says Benjamin Haddad, of the Atlantic Council, a think-tank in Washington: ""But the G7 outcome reflects the work that he has been doing, investing in that relationship for the past two years, which is now paying off.""
A second is the leadership gap in Europe. America has grown used to looking to Mrs Merkel. Yet the chancellor has been weakened by her party's electoral difficulties, along with the prospect of recession in Germany. Brexit, meanwhile, is occupying all of Britain's diplomatic bandwidth. Mr Macron, who keeps a copy of Charles de Gaulle's memoirs on his desk, is eager to occupy the space. To that end, he has helped manoeuvre France-friendly nominees into top European jobs, including Ursula von der Leyen, the incoming European Commission president, and Christine Lagarde at the European Central Bank.
A final factor is France's relative economic resilience. French gdp is expected to grow by 1.3% this year, compared with 0.5% in Germany. Unemployment is still 8.5%, but that is its lowest level in a decade. France is less export-dependent than Germany and so less vulnerable to trade turbulence. And it has benefited from the fiscal boost Mr Macron injected late last year in response to the gilets jaunes protests. The president's poll ratings have now recovered to where they were a year ago.
The French, with their universalist aspirations, are unusually sensitive to how well their leaders do abroad. Mr Macron's G7 performance was roundly applauded at home. The summit, wrote Le Monde, was an ""unquestionable success"". Deals may yet come unstuck. Talks may not materialise. Disappointments are inevitable. But Biarritz suggested that Mr Macron is growing into a role as a European leader who is prepared to take risks, push new ideas, and try to use the multilateral system to ease tensions and defend the liberal order.","French diplomacy

Pictures of fires raging in the rainforest. A social-media storm in which #AmazonIsBurning dominated what passes for the global conversation. A war of words in which Emmanuel Macron, France's president, branded as a liar his Brazilian counterpart, Jair Bolsonaro, who in turn accused Mr Macron of colonialism and mocked his wife's looks. An offer of $22m from the G7 countries to help fight the fires, which Mr Bolsonaro rejected unless Mr Macron ate his words. It has been an extraordinary ten days for Brazil. Through the smoke, two things are clear: Mr Bolsonaro's policies are profoundly destructive of the Amazon rainforest, and deterring him will take much more subtlety abroad and more determination from opponents and even allies at home.
A former army captain of far-right views, Mr Bolsonaro won Brazil's presidency last year partly on a platform of reviving a moribund economy by sweeping away left-wingery and green regulation. He promised to end fines for violations of environmental law, shrink the protected areas that account for half of the Brazilian Amazon and fight ngos, for which he has a visceral hatred. In office, his government has gutted the environment ministry and Ibama, the quasi-autonomous environmental agency. Six of the ten senior posts in the ministry's department of forests and sustainable development are vacant, according to its website. The government talks of ""monetising"" the Amazon but sabotaged a $1.3bn European fund that aims to give value to the standing forest.
Ranchers, illegal loggers and settlers in the Amazon have taken all this as encouragement to power up their chainsaws. Deforestation in the first seven months of this year rose by 67% compared with the same period last year, according to INPE, the government's space research agency. Mr Bolsonaro called iNPE's data lies and fired its director. His initial reaction was, preposterously, to blame the fires on ngos.
Mr Bolsonaro's approach is driven by prejudice and nationalism. ""He deeply, ideologically, believes that environmentalism is part of a left-wing view of the world,"" says Matias Spektor, at Fundaçâo Getulio Vargas, a university in Sāo Paulo. Brazil's armed forces have long thought that outsiders have designs on the Amazon, and that they must develop it or risk losing it. The generals in Mr Bolsonaro's cabinet, usually a force for restraint, are not on this issue. Behind his tirades against Mr Macron is the expectation that Brazilians will rally round the flag. That is why the world needs to tread carefully.
Mr Bolsonaro is right about some things. Mr Macron was high-handed in discussing the Amazon at the G7 without inviting Brazil. While the world has a legitimate interest in the rainforest's fate, it doesn't own it (though French Guiana has a chunk). Mr Bolsonaro is right, too, that fires were worse in some past years. Many maps exaggerate their extent.
Brazil has some of the world's most stringent controls on deforestation. From 2005 these slowed the forest's destruction dramatically, before they were undermined by budget cuts and now by Mr Bolsonaro.
Like Janus, his government faces two ways on this issue. Brazilian diplomats abroad present their country as committed to halting deforestation. At home, the president winks at those who practise it. That is why it is important to hold his government to its word.
""The main issue is how to get to a rational discussion about what's happening,"" says Marcos Jank of the Centre for Global Agribusiness at Insper, a university in Sāo Paulo. That is something Brazil's modern farmers want. They persuaded Mr Bolsonaro not to pull out of the Paris agreement on climate change, or abolish the environment ministry. They fear consumer boycotts and the eu pulling out of a recently concluded trade agreement, as Mr Macron threatened. In fact, both would have limited effect. Mr Jank notes that 95% of Brazil's $102bn-worth of agricultural exports are commodities that don't go directly to consumers; 60% go to Asia. But Brand Brazil has certainly been damaged.
Politically, too, Mr Bolsonaro is on treacherous ground. Although Brazilian nationalism should not be under-estimated, most Brazilians worry about climate change. As the president spoke on television on August 23rd about the fires, there were pot-banging protests in prosperous parts of cities, which helped to elect him. But halting his scorchedearth practices will require organised political action as well as protest.","How not to save the Amazon

Six of the ten senior posts in the ministry 's department of forests and sustainable development are vacant , according to its website . The government talks of "" monetising "" the Amazon but sabotaged a $ 1.3bn European fund that aims to give value to the standing forest . 
 Ranchers , illegal loggers and settlers in the Amazon have taken all this as encouragement to power up their chainsaws . Deforestation in the first seven months of this year rose by 67 % compared with the same period last year , according to INPE , the government 's space research agency . Jair Bolsonaro called iNPE 's data lies and fired its director . Jair Bolsonaro's initial reaction was , preposterously , to blame the fires on ngos . 
 Jair Bolsonaro's approach is driven by prejudice and nationalism . "" Jair Bolsonaro deeply , ideologically , believes that environmentalism is part of a left - wing view of the world , "" says Matias Spektor , at Fundaçâo Getulio Vargas , a university in Sāo Paulo . Brazil 's armed forces have long thought that outsiders have designs on the Amazon , and that they must develop it or risk losing it . The generals in Jair Bolsonaro's cabinet , usually a force for restraint , are not on this issue . Behind Jair Bolsonaro's tirades against Mr Macron is the expectation that Brazilians will rally round the flag . That is why the world needs to tread carefully . 
 Jair Bolsonaro is right about some things . Mr Macron was high - handed in discussing the Amazon at the G7 without inviting Brazil . While the world has a legitimate interest in the rainforest 's fate , it does n't own it ( though French Guiana has a chunk ) . Jair Bolsonaro is right , too , that fires were worse in some past years . Many maps exaggerate their extent . 
 Brazil has some of the world 's most stringent controls on deforestation . From 2005 these slowed the forest 's destruction dramatically , before they were undermined by budget cuts and now by Jair Bolsonaro . 
 Like Janus , Jair Bolsonaro's government faces two ways on this issue . Brazilian diplomats abroad present their country as committed to halting deforestation . At home , Jair Bolsonaro winks at those who practise it . That is why it is important to hold Jair Bolsonaro's government to its word . 
 "" The main issue is how to get to a rational discussion about what 's happening , "" says Marcos Jank of the Centre for Global Agribusiness at Insper , a university in Sāo Paulo . That is something Brazil 's modern farmers want . They persuaded Jair Bolsonaro not to pull out of the Paris agreement on climate change , or abolish the environment ministry . They fear consumer boycotts and the eu pulling out of a recently concluded trade agreement , as Mr Macron threatened . In fact , both would have limited effect . Mr Jank notes that 95 % of Brazil 's $ 102bn - worth of agricultural exports are commodities that do n't go directly to consumers ; 60 % go to Asia . But Brand Brazil has certainly been damaged . 
 Politically , too , Jair Bolsonaro is on treacherous ground . Although Brazilian nationalism should not be under - estimated , most Brazilians worry about climate change . As Jair Bolsonaro spoke on television on August 23rd about the fires , there were pot - banging protests in prosperous parts of cities , which helped to elect Jair Bolsonaro . But halting Jair Bolsonaro's scorchedearth practices will require organised political action as well as protest .",140,Brazil,ctb-140-2,IN TERM,True,"his Brazilian counterpart , Jair Bolsonaro , who in turn accused Mr Macron of colonialism and mocked his wife 's looks",26,True

FOUR YEARS ago the unexpected victory of Mauricio Macri in Argentina's presidential election marked the ebbing of the ""pink tide"", a long period of hegemony of the left in South America. In its wake centre-right candidates went on to triumph in Peru, Ecuador, Chile and Colombia (although in Ecuador Lenín Moreno moved right only when in office). In Brazil last year a far-rightist, Jair Bolsonaro, won the presidency. Shortly after Mr Macri's victory, in Venezuela the opposition trounced the United Socialist Party of Nicolás Maduro in a parliamentary election, the last free contest that country has seen. And Evo Morales, Bolivia's leftist president since 2006, lost a referendum to change the constitution to allow him to run for a fourth term.
Last month Mr Macri's bid for a second term foundered when he fared badly in ""primary"" elections (in reality, a dress rehearsal). Everything suggests that in the real thing in October the Peronists will return to power in the form of Alberto Fernández, a social democrat, and his running-mate, Cristina Fernández de Kirchner, who ruled as a leftist populist from 2007 to 2015. Will Argentina once again portend a broader shift in the region's political weather?
Some analysts think so. Noting that leftists had lost in the recent past because they were incumbents rather than because voters had become more conservative, Christopher Garman of Eurasia Group, a consultancy, wrote that ""antiestablishment, or change"" elections risk ending market-friendly policies in several South American countries over the next three years.
He has a point. Leftist presidents were popular in part because the pink tide coincided with a commodity boom. Their successors did not have their luck. Governing is hard in South America nowadays. Voters are angry about a mixture of slower growth or economic stagnation, corruption scandals, crime and poor public services (see Graphic Detail). The fake news, ""alternative facts"" and smears of social media have damaged the faith of citizens in their leaders and institutions. Political fragmentation means that several current presidents lack the legislative majority required to enact needed reforms. That applies in particular to Sebastián Piñera in Chile, Martín Vizcarra in Peru and Iván Duque in Colombia. In several cases, political honeymoons have been short. Mr Duque's approval rating is in the mid-30s, while those of Mr Piñera, Mr Moreno and Mr Bolsonaro languish in the 20s.
Yet none of this translates automatically into a return of the left. Argentina is a special case. The failure of Mr Macri's attempt to clean up the economic mess left by Ms Fernández, and a consequent descent into recession and inflation, explain why voters have deserted him (see Finance section). Perhaps the only potential parallel is with Ecuador, where Mr Moreno, like Mr Macri, has turned to the imf and growth is mediocre. It is not hard to see a candidate backed by Rafael Correa, Ecuador's former populist strongman, winning in 2021.
But the left has its own problems. In Uruguay, after 14 years in power, the Broad Front looks tired. An election in October could bring victory for the centre-right. In Chile and Peru, the left is divided. Everywhere the Venezuelan catastrophe is a propaganda tool against left-wingers who have failed to keep their distance from Mr Maduro or to smash the icon of Hugo Chávez, his mentor and predecessor. And just like the swing to the right, the pink tide originally owed more to anti-incumbent feeling than to an ideological shift among voters.
Populists tend to be more successful than moderates in riding out hard times. Take Mexico, which elected Andrés Manuel López Obrador, a left-wing populist, last year. He remains liked, mainly because carefully marketed social programmes and other gestures persuade many Mexicans that he is on their side. In Bolivia, having disregarded the referendum result, Mr Morales may win another term in October, partly because he controls the state. But eventually, if they are allowed to, voters turn against populists who fail. That applied to Ms Fernández and Mr Maduro.
Rather than a shift back to the left, South American politics is moving into a pattern of volatility, with short cycles of change. That is a mixed blessing. It will make it harder for would-be imitators of Chávez and Mr Morales to establish lasting hegemony. But it impedes the long-term investment and continuity of good policy that South America needs.","Argentina's lurch to the left, and what it means for South America

WHEN PEOPLE vote with their feet, they usually make an informed choice. Venezuelans, for example, have many compelling reasons to leave Venezuela. Its government admits that it killed 5,287 people last year for ""resistance to authority"", inflation has reached as high as 2,700,000% and by early 2018 the average person had lost 11kg (24.lb) from hunger. Perhaps 13% of the population have fled-over 4m people.
Citizens of El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala are also emigrating en masse. They are fed up with poverty and violence, and people-smugglers have become adept at transporting them. This exodus is the main reason why in the past year officers at the United States' southern border have detained more people trying to cross than in any 12-month period since 2009.
Venezuela and Central America are uniquely troubled. However, their citizens' desire to get out is increasingly common. Gallup, a pollster, asks people in 120 countries each year if they want to emigrate. From 2010 to 2018 the share that said ""yes"" rose in 15 of the 19 Latin American nations it tracks. In 2010, 19% of people in the region hoped to move abroad permanently, the same as in Europe. Now 31% do, as many as in the Middle East and Africa.
Many are afraid of being killed. In Brazil murders hit a record high of 63,880 in 2017, following a resurgence of fighting between criminal gangs; the share of citizens who wish to emigrate has tripled to 33%. The country's homicide rate is now roughly level with Colombia's-where it fell as the government's war with the FARC guerrillas wound down, but could pick up again if some fighters' recent decision to abandon the peace accord of 2016 causes a return to war (see Americas section).
In countries where crime has not risen, economic doldrums have been the main driver of discontent. In 2010 Latin America's GDP grew by 6%, well above the global average. By 2016 it was shrinking, due to recessions in Brazil and Argentina-the latter of which imposed capital controls this week (see Finance section). In Mexico, the region's second-biggest country, the economy has plodded along with low productivity growth and little social mobility.
Another thing making Latin America less liveable is corruption. The region is grubbier than you would expect, given its relative affluence. In Brazil the Lava Jato investigation has exposed bribes paid by industrial firms to scores of politicians. Alan García, a former president of Peru, killed himself in April to avoid arrest in conjunction with the Brazilian scandal. According to Latinobarómetro, an annual survey, the share of Latin Americans dissatisfied with how democracy works in their country has risen from 52% in 2010 to 71% last year.
Latin Americans are not just voting with their feet; they are venting at the ballot box, too. In 2018 messianic populists who railed against corruption and crime won presidential elections in Brazil (the conservative Jair Bolsonaro) and Mexico (the leftist Andrés Manuel López Obrador).

Countries to which Venezuelans are fleeing are becoming less welcoming
Katalina, a 20-year-old nursing student from Barquisimeto in north-western Venezuela, fled last year as living conditions became intolerable. She spent 11 months in Peru, but her hosts were hostile towards Venezuelan migrants, especially women, and she found little work. So in June she moved to Chile, arriving just as its government tightened rules for Venezuelans entering the country and began expelling those without the right papers. She sneaked across the border at night, dreading that she would step on a landmine planted by Chile in the desert in the 1970s. Now she is staying with a friend in Santiago, Chile's capital, waiting for permission to remain. ""All I want is for my situation to be regularised,"" she says.
Katalina's obstacle-strewn odyssey is becoming the norm for Venezuelans joining the 4m who have fled since 2014. Perhaps half a million more have not been counted because they sneaked across borders. On August 26th Ecuador became the latest country to tighten entry requirements, joining Peru and Chile in obliging most Venezuelans to present a passport and evidence of a clean criminal record, which are difficult to obtain. Brazil and Colombia have so far kept their borders open.
Barriers will not stop Venezuelans from fleeing chaos and repression at home. The exodus could exceed 8m, a quarter of the population, by the end of 2020 unless democracy and stability return, predicts the Brookings Institution in Washington (see Bello). Even then, not everyone will go back; those who do will take time. ""We are looking at a complex set of needs for the next two years, even if there is a political solution today,"" says Eduardo Stein, the representative for Venezuelan migrants of the UN's refugee agency and the International Organisation for Migration.
Until now, the largest displacement of people in Latin America's history has occurred without much international fuss. In part that is because it has taken place mostly by land, unprompted by war or natural disaster. Four-fifths of migrants have stayed within the region (see map on next page). The good grace with which most neighbouring countries have received them up to now has allowed others to ignore the crisis. Outside donors have given just $100 for each Venezuelan migrant, compared with $5,000 for each of the 5.6m refugees from Syria.
But as Venezuela's crisis has dragged on, destination countries are withdrawing their initial warm welcome. Recent refugees are poorer than those in earlier waves. They are arriving in countries where economic growth is slow, good jobs are scarce and budgets for health and education are stretched. Early promises to co-operate in dealing with the flow of migrants are being broken. Door-slamming adds to the number of unlawful migrants, who are vulnerable to exploitation by employers and recruitment by criminal groups.
It increases the burden on Colombia, which remains the most open of the destination countries. That is partly because it cannot police its 2,200km (1,400-mile) border with Venezuela. The influx adds to disorder on a frontier already plagued by Venezuelan-backed guerrilla groups. Now Colombia must cope with a build-up on its southern border of refugees who had hoped to enter Peru and Ecuador. Although Venezuelans are likely to boost economic growth in their new countries, few governments appreciate the opportunity.
Destination countries have largely avoided setting up camps, wisely preferring to integrate Venezuelans into their societies. Brazil is relocating migrants from the border state of Roraima to cities farther south. Venezuelans do all kinds of work. Three-fifths of people who took Chile's medical exam in July were Venezuelan doctors seeking recertification. In Colombia Venezuelans ease labour shortages in the flower and coffee industries.
More visible are those who appear at street corners to sell sweets or beg. Unskilled workers swell the informal labour force, in countries where a huge proportion of jobs are informal. Many women in Trinidad find work in bars and clubs, sometimes a gateway to prostitution. In Boa Vista, Roraima's capital, the population of 400,000 now includes more than 50,000 Venezuelans. ""We lost control of the city,"" says its mayor, Teresa Surita. Homelessness in towns on Colombia's border with Venezuela has shot up.
Though they are letting in fewer Venezuelans, governments are trying to provide services to those who have already arrived. That is a struggle. Hospitals in Roraima have staff shortages, in part because Cuba recalled its doctors in the face of hostility from the country's right-wing president, Jair Bolsonaro. Colombia's government estimates that the cost of providing health care, schooling and other services to Venezuelans will be 0.5% of gdp this year, about a fifth of its expected budget deficit. Ecuador, whose highly indebted government has had to go to the imf for financial help, will spend $i70m a year on health and education for holders of an ""exceptional humanitarian visa"" and Venezuelans who arrived before the visa rule took effect.
""People used to feel sorry for [Venezuelans], but now there's fear of crime,"" says Amparo Goyes, a resident of Tumbaco, a suburb of Quito, Ecuador's capital. In January the stabbing of a pregnant Ecuadorean woman by her Venezuelan ex-boyfriend triggered attacks on migrants in the northern city of Ibarra and contributed to the decision to tighten entry requirements. A survey by Peru's government found that 86% of Peruvians expect to be the victim of a crime in the coming year.
Such strains are hardening attitudes. A Gallup poll published in June showed that support among Colombians for accepting refugees fell below 50% for the first time. Venezuelans' ""negative image"" rose to 67%, its highest-ever level. A survey of Chileans by cadem, a pollster, published in July found that 73% approved of the government's crackdown and 83% backed restrictions on immigration. In Trinidad opposition politicians have called for tighter controls on Venezuelans.
Colombia does not have that option. It has been an exemplar, issuing permits that allow 700,000 Venezuelans to work and receive public services for at least two years. It plans to issue a permit for migrants without the right papers, allowing them to stay if they find an employer. In March most parties with members in congress signed a pact promising not to stir resentment against Venezuelans in campaigns for regional elections due next month.
But its neighbours' new barriers are making Colombia nervous. A senior official says co-operation among destination countries started well, but in the past four months it has moved backwards. Colombia recently asked its neighbours to open a ""border-to-border humanitarian corridor"". Ecuador agreed to let through migrants with visas for other countries. The un has urged all countries in the region to give Venezuelans the rights of refugees, on the presumption that staying at home puts them at risk.
The one thing receiving countries all agree on is that they need more outside help. The un has collected less than a third of the $738m it sought in 2018, mostly from the United States. At the un General Assembly this month, Colombia's president, Iván Duque, will lead a regional appeal for more. ""Unfortunately, the world has not seen this as a global crisis,"" says David Smolansky, an exiled Venezuelan mayor who leads the migrant working group of the Organisation of American States. If Latin America is to continue coping as well as it has, that must change.","Venezuela's exodus

ommunism is soviet power plus C electrification,"" declared Vladimir Lenin in 1920. A century later, Andrés Manuel López Obrador's methodology for the redemption of Mexico is his morning press conference plus oil. He wants to raise oil output by almost half, and is poised to build Dos Bocas, an $8bn refinery that will be his country's largest. Mr López Obrador (or amlo, as he is known) defends this as boosting Mexico's energy security and sovereignty.
Jair Bolsonaro, Brazil's far-right president, claims that environmentalism is a left-wing plot. Latin American leftists' enthusiasm for oil refineries suggests otherwise. In Brazil Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, president from 2003 to 2011, ordered Petrobras, the state-controlled oil company, to build four of them. In Ecuador, Rafael Correa conducted a $2.2bn upgrade to a refinery. Peru's Ollanta Humala began a similar $3.5bn upgrade.
There are good reasons for amlo to want to exploit Mexico's natural resources to the full. Oil can help power growth and fill the treasury. But he is going about it in a different way from his predecessor, Enrique Peña Nieto, who opened up oil and gas to private investment but left Pemex, the state oil company, indebted and shot through with corruption. In May, amlo's government announced that no private bidders had met the terms for Dos Bocas's construction. It will now be handled, opaquely, by the state. He is throwing public money at Pemex without requiring its reform.
In private, officials admit concern. Dos Bocas is a ""pendejada"" (a load of bullshit), admits one. Mexico has no trouble importing gasoline from refineries on the United States' Gulf coast, says David Shields, an energy consultant in Mexico City. Money would be better spent on repairing inefficient existing refineries, or on expanding distribution grids for electricity and natural gas (though private investment could do those jobs).
Ideology in part explains the enthusiasm for such projects among leftists. Fossil-fuel nationalism is a throwback to the concerns of the Latin American left of the mid 20th century. amlo's adviser for the project is José Alberto Celestinos, aged 90, who was in charge of building refineries for Pemex in the 1970s. ""Oil is a fundamental national symbol in Mexico,"" says Lorenzo Meyer, a historian. ""To think of clean energy policies like in Europe is a luxury Mexicans can't give themselves.""
And, of course, big state projects offer the opportunity for many to make money. Few people expect Dos Bocas to hit its budget. The only one of Lula's refineries to be completed cost $20bn, nine times its original estimate. Half of the $5bn that Mr Correa's government spent on oil projects was stolen, according to his successor.
In energy terms, Latin America cannot be accused of being a dirty region. It has the world's cleanest energy matrix, largely because of its large hydroelectric dams (though in Mexico, with fewer big rivers, they provide less than a quarter of electricity compared with around half in the region as a whole). Most of Latin America's carbon emissions come from landuse changes and transport, as growing middle classes jump into cars. It could do its bit for the world by halting deforestation and embracing electric vehicles.
Some Latin American countries have encouraged non-conventional renewable technologies, such as wind and solar, whose price has fallen steeply. Rather than copy European subsidies, they have done so by fixing targets and by using auctions in which the market determines the supply price, notes Lisa Viscidi, an energy specialist at the InterAmerican Dialogue, a think-tank in Washington. More than 40% of Uruguay's electricity comes from wind, while solar plants provide 8% of Chile's. Both countries have had left-wing governments-but have no significant oil. The same goes for Costa Rica, which has set (and appears to be on track to meet) a target of producing all of its electricity from renewable sources by 2021.
In Mexico Mr Peña held three auction rounds for non-conventionals. amlo has cancelled the fourth round. ""They don't have a renewables policy,"" says Mr Shields. That is partly because the auctions involve private investment, which amlo distrusts, partly because wind and solar power are intermittent, and partly because nature has provided Mexico with a bounty of hydrocarbons. But if amlo looks around the world, he will see that oil is rarely fuel for corruption-free development, and that before too long it may be technologically redundant.","Why is the Latin American left hostile to clean energy?

In Peru, Susana Villarán, who was the mayor of Lima, is accused of taking illicit campaign money from Odebrecht, a Brazilian construction firm. Her jail mates include Keiko Fujimori, the leader of the opposition, who faces a similar accusation. All deny wrongdoing.
Corruption has rarely before been an issue of such burning public concern in Latin America. In a survey of more than 17,000 people in 18 of the region's countries published this week by Transparency International (TI), a Berlin-based watchdog, 85% said that government corruption was ""a big problem"" in their country, 53% think it is getting worse and 57% said it is not being tackled well. Broadening the scope of the question to include legislatures, police, judiciaries and business as well as executives, more Latin Americans see blanket corruption than in TI's equivalent poll in Africa.
That is surprising, because corruption tends to diminish as incomes rise and Latin America is better off than Africa. There are two caveats. Perception is not always reality: free media in Latin America have relentlessly publicised corruption cases since Brazil's sprawling Lava Jato scandal, centred on Odebrecht, broke in 2014. And some countries are cleaner than others. Uruguay and Chile, for example, are seen as less corrupt than many European countries.
Elsewhere, though, corruption is systemic and hydra-headed. It involves not just stealing public money, but distorting public spending and policy priorities by taking illicit money from private business. Once seen as necessary political grease, it is now recognised as a millstone. Estimates of its annual cost in Mexico vary from 2% to 10% of GDP. In a pioneering history of corruption in Peru, Alfonso Quiroz reckoned that between 1820 and 2000 it snaffled up to 40% of government spending and 3-4% of GDP growth per year.
Public anger has gone hand in hand with an unprecedented offensive against corruption in the region, which gathered strength with Lava Jato. The crackdown has been led by determined prosecutors and judges. New legal tools have been deployed, such as specialised anti-corruption investigators, plea-bargaining, preventive prison and international agreements to share financial information. This has delivered results. In Brazil, scores of politicians and businessmen are in jail. In Peru, four former presidents are under investigation (one, Alan García, committed suicide in April). In Guatemala, a former president and his vice-president are in prison.
But there have been excesses. Some question whether preventive prison has been abused. Peru's constitutional tribunal was this week hearing a plea to release Ms Fujimori, who has been in jail for 11 months without charge. The credibility of Lava Jato has been undermined by revelations, obtained by hacking, that Sergio Moro, its main judge, worked in unethical complicity with prosecutors.
Only in part because of such excesses, the crackdown is at a turning point. A backlash has begun. ""The anti-corruption struggle...is a chessboard in which the black pieces play too,"" notes Delia Ferreira, an Argentina lawyer who is president of TI. Brazil's supreme court recently quashed one corruption conviction because of a procedural mistake and is reviewing others. Guatemala's president has thrown out a UN-backed anticorruption commission (though El Salvador's new leader is setting up a similar body). After a primary election pointed to the return to power of Cristina Fernández in Argentina, courts have begun to stall graft cases against her.
But the mistakes suggest that the campaign should be sharpened, not abandoned. The impunity long enjoyed by the powerful in Latin America has at least been checked in some countries. The task now is to widen and fine-tune the use of the new legal tools, and to complement them with other reforms-of campaign finance and the judiciary itself. In the short term there is a risk that public anger generates an anti-political mood. That helped contrasting populists, Jair Bolsonaro and Andrés Manuel López Obrador, to power in Brazil and Mexico. But as Mr Quiroz has pointed out, corruption is a cause as well as a consequence of weak institutions. Trying to slay it is a duty that cannot be dodged.","The struggle against corruption reaches a turning point

Your article on British offshore wind suggested that the technology remains expensive (""The experiment""). Yet the latest auctions produced a price of about £40 ($50) per megawatt hour, well below the current wholesale price of electricity. Offshore wind is now the cheapest way of producing power in Britain.
You also supported Dieter Helm's acerbic criticisms of British energy policy for directing subsidies towards particular technologies, such as offshore wind. The recent auctions are a spectacular rebuttal of Professor Helm's theory. It is precisely because Britain has protected offshore wind over the past 15 years that the technology has now become unbelievably cheap. It is often difficult for economists such as Professor Helm to recognise this, but active industrial policies can work.
Lastly, you repeated the conventional final attack on offshore wind, pointing out that it is intermittent. Other countries around the North Sea have woken up to this problem, usually focusing on various technologies for converting ""power to gas"" as a way of ensuring this intermittency can be managed at enormous scale. The hibernation of energy policy over recent years has held up progress, but my hypothesis is that Britain will soon conclude, like other countries, that using surplus power to make renewable hydrogen is the logical route forward. This hydrogen will then be used to generate power when electricity supplies are scarce from the North Sea.

Polluting cannot be free. A strong price on carbon will incentivise producers and consumers to reduce emissions and innovators to create low-carbon technologies. And returning all the funds raised back to the economy means little to no economic loss and a much healthier future. Though the politics are challenging, as advocates are up against a wall of money, the American House of Representatives is considering four bipartisan bills that do just this, and one, the Energy Innovation Act, has 64 co-sponsors.

You observed that most of the benefits from reducing greenhouse-gas emissions ""will be accrued not today, but in 50 or 100 years."" It is worth adding that societies reap meaningful and immediate benefits from transitioning away from fossil fuels. In a recent research paper, our team found that replacing fossil fuels with renewable energy yields substantial short-term benefits associated with cleaner air, improved health and fewer premature deaths, which exceed policy costs. We also estimated that these immediate benefits may be larger than the near-term gains from mitigating climate change. Societies, therefore, have ample reason to act on climate change now.

It is true that climate change is not just an environmental problem and cuts across all activities. Yet the recipe for economic growth from mainstream economists, including The Economist, disregards climate change. Yes, economics textbooks cover externalities or spillover effects, but these have not been integral to growth analysis. A search finds abundant climate studies, but less than 0.5% of the numerous growth articles over the past 50 years seem to factor climate effects.
That allows politicians such as Jair Bolsonaro, Brazil's president, to argue that environmental protection is inimical to growth, even as the emerging reality is the opposite. American policy, too, sees any deregulation, including policy that mortgages the environment, as pro-growth. Yes, environmental destruction may boost short-term growth, but the climate outcomes hurt long-term growth and welfare.
So, changing the conduct of growth economics is essential if we are to avert a climate catastrophe. Unless the economics profession stops ranking and rewarding countries based primarily on how much they deregulate and boost short-term GDP, the climate action that you rightly call for will continue to lag dangerously.

Climatologists are like economists. They repeatedly produce false predictions based on skewed statistics and erroneous models. Neither wholly understand their respective cycles. Climatologists want to twiddle the carbon-dioxide knob just as central bankers twiddle interest rates.
The Economist is fuelling peak-hysteria near the top of a climate bull market. The inevitable climate bear market will be more sudden, geologically, longer and colder than any climatologist can at present imagine.

Most, but not all, emerging markets have overcome high inflation
THIS YEAR marked a quarter of a century since Brazil beat hyperinflation with a conjuring trick. The old currency, the cruzeiro, had been debased, suffering annual price rises reaching 2,500%. Following the advice of a small group of economists, the government required firms to list prices and wages in ""units of real value"", a new unit of account linked loosely to the dollar. Cruzeiros-ever more of them-continued to be used for payment, with the exchange rate between the unit and the currency widely publicised. Eventually the authorities simply scrapped the cruzeiro, replacing it with the freshly-minted ""real"", which by then was a trusted yardstick. Inflation tumbled to 22% in 1995.
It seemed like a miracle. Yet arguably what came next, both in Brazil and other emerging markets, was more remarkable still. Since then, many emerging-market economies have defeated not just hyperinflation but high inflation too. In 1995 median inflation among emerging markets was over 10%. By 2017 it was only 3.3%. Exclude crisis-struck Turkey and Argentina, and at the start of 2019 the gap between average inflation in emerging markets and advanced economies was at a record low (see chart). In Brazil today inflation is just 3.4%.
This longer, slower miracle was achieved using rich-world methods but in harsher conditions. By the 1990s, and especially after a speculative attack on Thailand's currency in 1997 sparked a financial crisis in Asia, emerging markets were moving away from the old monetary paradigm of fixed exchange rates. At the end of the decade they began to embrace inflation targets. The first to transition was Poland in 1999, followed by Brazil in 1999, South Africa in 2000, Hungary in 2001 and the Philippines in 2002. Today 24 emerging markets have inflation-targeting central banks.
On average they have been a clear success. Inflation has fallen, as has its volatility. Prices still rise faster than in the rich world but targets are also higher: typically closer to 5% than the 2% advanced-economy norm. Yet the landscape is varied. In countries like Chile, with transparent central banks, low public debt and high openness to trade, inflation expectations are pinned down. In others, like India, with higher public debt and less credible institutions, they remain volatile. And emerging markets still provide the main exceptions to global disinflation, including Argentina and Turkey, where inflation is running at 54% and 15% respectively.
This variation is one reason why there is not much head-scratching about low inflation in emerging markets. Another is that fewer central banks than in the rich world-a little more than half of the total- are undershooting their targets. And monetary policymakers are not pressed up against the lower bound on interest rates, at which low inflation becomes a greater threat. But this poses its own problem. Higher rates make emerging markets potentially attractive sources of yield for richworld portfolio investors, who tend to be fickle. Capital flowing in and out can send exchange rates haywire, affecting not only inflation but also trade and financial stability.
In such an environment anchored inflation expectations take on more importance. They make the response of inflation to exchange-rate fluctuations transient and less severe, thereby allowing central banks to focus on the health of their economies. Last year the IMF found that from 2011 to 2015 monetary policy reacted more to local economic conditions in emerging markets where inflation expectations were better anchored. That was particularly helpful during the ""taper tantrum"" of 2013, in which the prospect of less quantitative easing in America sent many emerging-market currencies tumbling.
Dollar dilemma
The trouble is that the exchange rate partly determines the local economic conditions to which central banks must respond. As well as boosting inflation, a cheaper currency makes it harder for emerging-market corporations that have borrowed in dollars to service their debts. These dollar debts have grown from 14% to 20% of GDP since 2009, on average. And although in theory a falling exchange rate should at least boost exports, this effect is limited by the fact that so much trade is invoiced in dominant currencies like the dollar or the euro. Research by Gita Gopinath and Emine Boz of the IMF and Mikkel Plagborg-Møller of Princeton University has found that a strong dollar tends to gum up world trade, as well as making dollar debts harder to repay.
As a result, even emerging markets with independent central banks and floating exchange rates can appear to be at the mercy of international financial conditions, in particular the policy of the Federal Reserve. Certainly many still mimic the Fed. As of August, 13 emerging-market central banks had followed the Fed's interest-rate rises in 2018 and cuts in 2019. Several, such as Indonesia and Thailand, raised rates in 2018 even with inflation well under control. And many continue to intervene directly in currency markets, accumulating and running down foreign-exchange reserves even as they maintain a notional commitment to floating exchange rates. ""The textbook version of the inflation-targeting framework is obviously too narrow for emerging-market-economy central banks,"" said Agustín Carstens, head of the Bank for International Settlements and former governor of the Bank of Mexico, in May.
That casts some doubt on the simple story that inflation targeting in emerging markets has been a triumph for conventional economics. What is more, it is uncertain how secure emerging markets' low inflation is. Three factors threaten it: the strength of institutions, fiscal policy and the global environment.
One of the curiosities of the rich world's low inflation is that it has coincided with the rise of populism. Yet it is only in emerging markets, specifically in Argentina and Turkey, that institutional weakness has led to runaway prices. In Argentina President Mauricio Macri's government tried to establish inflation-targeting at the central bank in 2017, but a series of missteps hurt its credibility before a weakening of Mr Macri's re-election prospects caused a further run on the currency. Turkey has an inflation-targeting central bank but it has come under relentless attack from President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, who claims, wrongly, that higher interest rates cause inflation.
Not all populists have laid siege to their central bank. In Mexico President Andrés Manuel López Obrador has promised not to interfere with the Bank of Mexico. In Brazil President Jair Bolsonaro's Chicago-educated economy minister Paulo Guedes has defended the independence of the central bank, and the legislature is considering granting it formal independence. Still, emerging-markets institutions are clearly more vulnerable to populists than the rich world's. Even in India, where the central bank is older than the republic, the head of the central bank resigned in December 2018 after a string of conflicts with the government, which pressed for looser policies and a large bite of the central bank's capital.
Fiscal policy is the second worry. Unlike in advanced economies, budget-balancing played an important role in emerging markets' battle against inflation. Their government debt peaked at over 70% of GDP in the mid-1990s. By the eve of the financial crisis in 2007 it was down to about half that. This was partly just luck. A commodities boom boosted growth and filled government coffers, creating space for central banks to establish credibility, says Guillermo Tolosa of Oxford Economics, a consultancy. It soothed worries about so-called ""fiscal dominance"", when governments are tempted to inflate away their debt problems.
Since then, however, debt has been rising again. It is forecast to average 53% of GDP this year, and 60% of GDP by 2024. Mr Tolosa is unworried, pointing out that even in Brazil, which has a huge hole in its budget caused by public pensions, inflation expectations are under control. But others, such as the World Bank, have issued warnings about debt. Although economists are revising up their estimates of the debt that advanced economies can bear in a world of low interest rates, the same argument does not apply in emerging markets, where rates are higher and investors flightier.
The final factor is the external environment. Those who champion inflation-targeting reject the idea that emerging markets' disinflation is a result of global factors rather than better economic policy. That is surely right when looking at the long-term trend. But because inflation expectations are less anchored in emerging markets, the short term matters quite a bit. In that respect today's global disinflationary environment surely helps. So whereas the rich world might breathe a sigh of relief were global inflation to rise, it would not benefit emerging markets. And higher inflation in America would probably mean higher interest rates there and hence disruptive capital flight.
The upshot is that emerging markets must remain more vigilant about inflation than the rich world. They have not yet reached the point where more inflation looks desirable. That is true only in advanced economies, and calls for its own policy agenda.","Emerging markets
Most, but not all, emerging markets have overcome high inflation
THIS YEAR marked a quarter of a century since Brazil beat hyperinflation with a conjuring trick. The old currency, the cruzeiro, had been debased, suffering annual price rises reaching 2,500%. Following the advice of a small group of economists, the government required firms to list prices and wages in ""units of real value"", a new unit of account linked loosely to the dollar. Cruzeiros-ever more of them-continued to be used for payment, with the exchange rate between the unit and the currency widely publicised. Eventually the authorities simply scrapped the cruzeiro, replacing it with the freshly-minted ""real"", which by then was a trusted yardstick. Inflation tumbled to 22% in 1995.
It seemed like a miracle. Yet arguably what came next, both in Brazil and other emerging markets, was more remarkable still. Since then, many emerging-market economies have defeated not just hyperinflation but high inflation too. In 1995 median inflation among emerging markets was over 10%. By 2017 it was only 3.3%. Exclude crisis-struck Turkey and Argentina, and at the start of 2019 the gap between average inflation in emerging markets and advanced economies was at a record low (see chart). In Brazil today inflation is just 3.4%.
This longer, slower miracle was achieved using rich-world methods but in harsher conditions. By the 1990s, and especially after a speculative attack on Thailand's currency in 1997 sparked a financial crisis in Asia, emerging markets were moving away from the old monetary paradigm of fixed exchange rates. At the end of the decade they began to embrace inflation targets. The first to transition was Poland in 1999, followed by Brazil in 1999, South Africa in 2000, Hungary in 2001 and the Philippines in 2002. Today 24 emerging markets have inflation-targeting central banks.
On average they have been a clear success. Inflation has fallen, as has its volatility. Prices still rise faster than in the rich world but targets are also higher: typically closer to 5% than the 2% advanced-economy norm. Yet the landscape is varied. In countries like Chile, with transparent central banks, low public debt and high openness to trade, inflation expectations are pinned down. In others, like India, with higher public debt and less credible institutions, they remain volatile. And emerging markets still provide the main exceptions to global disinflation, including Argentina and Turkey, where inflation is running at 54% and 15% respectively.
This variation is one reason why there is not much head-scratching about low inflation in emerging markets.

ATALAIA DO NORTE, BRAZIL; NAZARETH, COLOMBIA; AND VATICAN CITY
The drift of power in the church away from the north towards the south is heightening tensions within the institution
AS THE SUN sets over Nazareth, a village on the banks of the Amazon river in the Colombian rainforest, a Jesuit priest peers out at a small congregation, made up of members of the indigenous Tikuna people. They are sitting on rickety benches around the edges of a cement church. ""Why is everyone so far away?"" asks Father Valério Paulo Sartor, stepping down from the altar to say mass from the aisle. ""If you won't come to me, I'll come to you.""
Some 6,000 miles away in Rome, bishops, indigenous leaders and NGO representatives from the Amazon basin, together with Vatican prelates, are discussing how the Catholic church can do just that. In a three-week synod that ends on October 27th, they hope to find new ways for the church to work with local communities to tackle the crises facing the region-and Catholicism-in a part of the world where the church is overstretched, understaffed, yet still remarkably influential.
The synod represents the biggest step yet towards recognising something many Catholics in the West, especially church leaders, have been reluctant to acknowledge: just as economic and diplomatic power in the secular world is slipping away from the North Atlantic region, a similar process is taking place in Catholicism. In the secular world, the shift is to Asia. Within the Catholic church it is towards not only Asia, but Africa and Latin America, too. That is forcing the church to consider how far it is willing to adapt to the practices and beliefs of cultures with their own spiritual traditions. The synod has added to fears of a new schism within the church.
Catholicism's three biggest national churches are those of Brazil, Mexico and the Philippines. It has become a religion largely of the poor world, but with a leadership that is still predominantly rooted in the rich one. Around 40% of baptised Catholics are from North America, Europe, Australasia and Japan, yet those regions provide the church with 57% of its cardinals. Italy, with 4% of the world's Catholic population, is the birthplace of almost one in five of the ""princes of the church"".
Pope Francis, who is the first Latin American pontiff, has tried to rebalance things. He joked on the night of his election in 2013 that his fellow cardinals had gone ""almost to the ends of the Earth"" to find him. He has continued their quest. More than half the cardinals he has created come from the developing world. His long-awaited reform of the administration of the Catholic church may take the process further by reducing the scope of the Vatican and transferring some of its departments- and power-to other parts of the world.
That shift has been exacerbated by the growing threat posed by climate change. The pope has long argued that care for the environment is inseparable from the fight against global inequality. He called the synod, the first to be dedicated to a single region, partly because of the Amazon's crucial role as a buffer against climate change. Its basin contains 40% of Earth's rainforests and serves as a carbon sink, mitigating warming. But rising deforestation, on the pretext of development, threatens the sustainability of the ecosystem. The insouciance of regional governments, especially Brazil's, puts them on a collision course with the church.
Leaders from half a dozen ethnic groups gathered recently in Atalaia do Norte, a town outside an indigenous territory the size of Austria, to discuss a rise in invasions by illegal miners and loggers emboldened by Brazil's far-right president, Jair Bolsonaro. His government has shrugged off deforestation, vowed to legalise mining on indigenous lands, and hollowed out the environment ministry and the indigenous agency, funai. The murder in September of a contractor from funai who worked in that territory, Vale do Javarí-and the subsequent exodus of other workers after they were threatened-left the tribes feeling even more vulnerable.
Despite the church's chequered history in the region (it is credited with educating millions of poor children but blamed for its complicity with colonialism and the economic exploitation that followed), many indigenous people see the institution as their most promising ally. ""In the past, the church made us lose our culture, but there's a new spirit in the head of the pope,"" says Absalon, a middle-aged curaca (chief) from a Uitoto village near Nazareth.
The Indigenist Missionary Council (CIMI), a human-rights organisation established by the Catholic church in Brazil in 1972 and run mostly by lay-workers, helps indigenous tribes secure land rights and put pressure on governments to uphold them. In a vast region where the state's presence is limited, CIMI also tells the authorities about abuses against indigenous people. ""The church is often the bridge between the tribes and the government,"" says Felício Pontes, a public prosecutor who worked for two decades in the Amazon. ""It saves us time and money.""
But the Catholic church is not an NGO; it wants to save souls as well as trees. Its efforts to do so raise an issue that resonates far beyond Latin America and the Catholic church. ""The indigenous representatives [in the synod] are saying: 'If you don't recognise some part of indigenous spirituality, you will lose us',"" says Josianne Gauthier, a guest at the synod and the secretary-general of cidse, an international alliance of Catholic charities.
How far, though, can a religion based on dogma go in respecting other belief systems before it irreparably compromises its own? The dilemma posed by inculturation-the adaptation of a religion to alien cultures-has been central to the synod's deliberations. It parallels the secular debate in countries that have experienced mass immigration over the relative merits of multiculturalism and assimilation.
Christians have been borrowing from other religions since the days when the pagan feast of Saturnalia transmogrified into Christmas and the Gaelic festival of Samhain became All Saints' Day. In the sermons he delivers in Nazareth, Father Valerio adapts a few of the details. The figs become local acai berries and Mary and Joseph travel, not by donkey, but in a canoe.
Few Catholics dispute the need for compromise if their faith is to prevail in a part of the world where it is increasingly being challenged by other brands of Christianity, particularly the evangelical kind. But many would be shocked to hear Adolfo Zon Pereira, the bishop of the Alto Solimőes region of the Brazilian Amazon, say: ""We don't talk about conversion any more."" Dialogue with locals, he argues, should be ""intercultural and inter-religious"" in order to protect ""our shared house"".
To the retired pastor of Marajó, another Amazonian diocese, this verges on sacrilege. Bishop José Luís Azcona Hermoso believes that the synod has been irretrievably corrupted by an ""obsession to understand the Amazon from the [perspective of] indigenous people"", who make up only a small fraction of its residents.
On October 4th, two days before the synod opened, Pope Francis and other Vatican dignitaries attended a ceremony in the Vatican gardens that gave substance to the worst fears of those who believe that the pope's tolerant liberalism risks carrying him to the brink of heresy, or even beyond. ""A group of people, including Amazonians in ritual dress, as well as people in lay clothes and a Franciscan brother, knelt and bowed in a circle around images of two pregnant women who appeared to be semiclothed,"" according to the Catholic News Agency. A woman later presented one of the statues, apparently representing the Andean fertility goddess, Pachamama, to Pope Francis, who blessed it.
The event, with its suggestion of pagan worship, set off a social-media firestorm of indignation. A ""blasphemous abomination"" is how one conservative website described it. On October 21st a video was uploaded to YouTube showing the removal of wooden figures similar to those used in the Vatican ceremony from a Rome church. They were then cast into the Tiber.
Exasperation with the reforming pope has been gathering momentum among a minority of traditional Catholics. Even some of his cardinals believe he is distorting the church's teaching. Talk of a schism within the church is growing. Last month Pope Francis said he was not afraid of such a rift, but prayed that it would not happen.
The discussion at the synod of whether to recommend in the Amazon region the ordination of women as deacons or that of married men as priests will do little to heal such divisions. Both questions have arisen as a result of local issues, in particular, a scarcity of manpower. Most missionaries in the Amazon are lay-workers or women. Father Valerio makes it to Nazareth, less than an hour up the Amazon from where he lives, only every couple of months. Some isolated places see a priest just once a year.
Where do they go from here?
The pope is not bound to respect the synod's advice. But a strong consensus against either measure would make it harder for him to steamroll them through. As a first step towards drawing up the synod's final report, 12 working groups were formed. Six have endorsed the ordination of viri probati (a church phrase meaning ""men of proven virtue""), who in many cases would be tribal elders, and four that of women as deacons. But the others either appealed for further debate or made no mention of the issue.
Approving either measure would prove divisive. The ordination of women as deacons would enable them to carry out a wide range of ecclesiastical activities, from delivering sermons to officiating at some baptisms and funerals. Supporters argue that women played a prominent role in the early church. Conservatives remain energetically resistant to the idea.
Traditionalists fear that ordaining married men as priests in the Amazon could gradually lead to wider, if not complete, acceptance of the practice. On October 18th Archbishop Rino Fisichella, a senior church bureaucrat, disclosed that his working group had recommended the creation of a new, Amazonian rite. Such a move should ensure that the practice of ordaining married priests was ""quarantined"" within the region, making sure that it could not easily be spread to the rest of the church. But opponents still fret that this could be the thin end of the wedge.
Such debates echo only faintly in the Amazon basin, where the concerns of most missionaries are largely practical. Father Valerio spends far more time on boats criss-crossing the region to check up on the well-being of residents-only some of whom are Catholic-than he does baptising babies or giving communion. His work will continue whatever Rome decides. But the current in the synod appears to be flowing in the direction of change.","The Roman Catholic church

But the others either appealed for further debate or made no mention of the issue . 
 Approving either measure would prove divisive . The ordination of women as deacons would enable them to carry out a wide range of ecclesiastical activities , from delivering sermons to officiating at some baptisms and funerals . Supporters argue that women played a prominent role in the early church . Conservatives remain energetically resistant to the idea . 
 Traditionalists fear that ordaining married men as priests in the Amazon could gradually lead to wider , if not complete , acceptance of the practice . On October 18th Archbishop Rino Fisichella , a senior church bureaucrat , disclosed that his working group had recommended the creation of a new , Amazonian rite . Such a move should ensure that the practice of ordaining married priests was "" quarantined "" within the region , making sure that it could not easily be spread to the rest of the church . But opponents still fret that this could be the thin end of the wedge . 
 Such debates echo only faintly in the Amazon basin , where the concerns of most missionaries are largely practical . Father Valerio spends far more time on boats criss - crossing the region to check up on the well - being of residents - only some of whom are Catholic - than he does baptising babies or giving communion . His work will continue whatever Rome decides . But the current in the synod appears to be flowing in the direction of change .",140,Brazil,ctb-140-2,IN TERM,True,"Brazil 's far - right president , Jair Bolsonaro",2,True

What does Narendra Modi want?
INDIA'S PRIME MINISTER has a knack for puns. ""Hard work is stronger than Harvard,"" he quipped when Amartya Sen, a Nobel prizewinning economist, criticised his policies. During last spring's re-election campaign Mr Modi relentlessly needled his chief opponent, Rahul Gandhi, the Congress party leader and fifthgeneration scion of India's most illustrious political family. The choice, growled the prime minister at rallies across the country, was between naamdar and kaamdar-those who rely on a fancy name, and those who achieve through hard work.
The cheers brought by such snappy juxtapositions, as well as cascades of votes, tell of more than Mr Modi's skill with words. They show the depth of resentment he has been able to tap into, simply by parading his own modest caste origins and posing as a proud working man. In the decades when the Congress party dominated politics, paunchy politicians moved into colonial-era bungalows and travelled first class. Sweeping reforms in the 1990s lifted living standards for everyone, but also widened gaps between rich and poor, and between fast-rising aspirations and more slowly evolving opportunities. The same anger that has swept the developed world against self-appointed elites emerged especially strongly in India. Polls showed that Indians, more than citizens of any other democracy, craved a strong leader or even army rule.
In 2014 Mr Modi seemed just the man. He presented himself first and foremost as an honest, powerful, capable administrator who could fix problems and work for ordinary people. Those ordinary people liked what they heard, and so did businessmen. Tired of bureaucratic sludge, they cheered Mr Modi's promise of ""minimum government, maximum governance"". Addressing concerns raised by his failure as chief minister of Gujarat to prevent a pogrom in 2002 that left some 2,000 people, mostly Muslims, dead, Mr Modi declared that sabka saath-all together-would mean sabka vikas-development for all.
He also presented a second image of himself: as a devout Hindu combining personal piety, celibacy, closeness to grassroots rightwing Hindu groups and toughness on Muslim issues. The combination of the two made him a powerful campaigner. In office, however, it is not clear which face dominates, the ideologue or the can-do reformer.
Mr Modi's government has rolled out, or appropriated and reenergised, dozens of central-government programmes: Smart Cities to eradicate urban squalor, Make in India to boost manufacturing, Digital India to overhaul the supply of government services, along with Clean India, Stand Up India, Start Up India and so on.
Many of these programmes have been successful: a campaign to replace wood and dung stoves with gas cookers has prevented tens of thousands of lives from being shortened by indoor air pollution. But it is not clear if other initiatives have been as successful as Mr Modi's administration claims. Polls show that a large majority of voters believe he has boosted India's prestige in the world, though the main evidence of this seems to be television footage of his foreign visits. Mr Modi's first term in office could hardly be called transformative. Expected reforms of antiquated administrative structures and of restrictive laws governing labour and land did not materialise. Except for a hardening of rhetoric towards Pakistan, there were no big shifts in foreign policy.
The biggest transformation came in the prime minister's office itself. Shunning press conferences, and instead connecting directly with voters via radio talks, tweets and a dedicated ""NaMo"" app, Mr Modi has made his role far more presidential. Appointing relatively weak ministers, he has pulled more powers into his own office. And he has skilfully and ruthlessly used state institutions to influence the media, punish perceived enemies and undermine the opposition.
It would seem that Mr Modi's main focus during his first term was to establish control. Entering his second term with an increased majority of the Lok Sabha's 545 seats, he faces few checks. True, the BJP won only 38% of the vote, against a respectable 19% for its only real rival, Congress. But the older party's successive losses have left it demoralised and fragmented. In the few states that it still runs, it is fighting for survival. The power that Mr Modi wields now places him closer to Turkey's Recep Tayyip Erdogan or Vladimir Putin than to more constitutionally constrained populists such as Donald Trump or Brazil's Jair Bolsonaro. Now that he has consolidated his power, what will India's strongest leader in a generation do with it?
Mr Modi has few academic credentials. His real education came in the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (rss), the ""volunteer organisation"" that is the quiet, steady flagship of an armada of Hindunationalist (or ""Hindutva"") groups. In his 20s Mr Modi served as an unpaid pracharak or devotee of the rss, soaking up ideas of India's past glories and of its subsequent humiliation under 1,000 years of Muslim and Christian rule. His political career began when in 1985 the group assigned him to work in one of the newer members of the Hindutva ""family"", the BJP.
The party was a big success. It captured power in Gujarat in 1995 and made Mr Modi the state's chief minister in 2001before elevating him to its national leadership in 2013. He not only led the BJP to two thumping general-election victories, but in the capable fists of his chief henchman from Gujarat, Amit Shah, the party has expanded its membership to 180m people (making it the world's largest political party) and, with its allies, stormed to power in 18 out of the 29 state assemblies.
During Mr Modi's first term, hardline Hindus complained that their agenda was not vigorously pursued. His government did move gently on such touchstone Hindutva issues as the building of a Ram temple atop a demolished mosque in Ayodhya, and demands to stamp Indian rule more firmly onto the restive, Muslim-majority state of Jammu & Kashmir. Quietly, however, it carried out a wholesale turnover of personnel that has transformed key institutions. In effect, Mr Modi has implanted a new, Rss-friendly nomenklatura nationwide, ranging from Yogi Adityanath, a far-right Hindu priest who is now chief minister of Uttar Pradesh, India's most populous state, to the pliant heads of state universities, friendly judges, army officers, boards of state-owned firms and bosses of private news networks.
In his own office, say former bureaucrats, Mr Modi's preference for ""hard work"" over fancy degrees has often meant rewarding loyalty over competence. The previous Congress government frequently ignored advice, says Puja Mehra, author of a book that laments lost economic opportunities under both governments. Mr Modi's simply got rid of dissenting advisers. The director of a think-tank concurs. ""His inner circle don't listen to anybody with an independent mind. They say, 'first agree with me',"" he says. ""Our civil-service culture is attuned to anticipating what the big man wants. And what Modi wants is control.""
So far in his second term, Mr Modi's team has shown less circumspection about its Hindutva agenda. Ram Madhav, a BJP leader, penned a post-election op-ed that hinted at more aggressive purges. The party's new mandate, he wrote, is a rejection of ""the pseudo-secular/liberal cartels that held a disproportionate sway and stranglehold over the intellectual and policy establishment of the country"". In a second term, he insisted, ""the remnants of that cartel need to be discarded from the country's academic, cultural and intellectual landscape.""
Mr Modi's move in August to tear down seven decades of complex constitutional niceties that had afforded the Muslim-majority Indian state of Jammu & Kashmir ostensible autonomy was a shock, but one that plenty of opponents had foreseen. The move split the territory in two, placed both parts under direct rule from Delhi and clamped 7.5m people under a virtual blockade. With the issue of the Ram temple having reached India's supreme court, a BJP minister in Uttar Pradesh crowed that it would soon be built because ""the judiciary is ours"".
Apparently not concerned that a campaign in the state of Assam to check nationality credentials has labelled nearly 2m residents as foreigners, Mr Modi's government is building prisons to hold them, and says it plans to expand the exercise across the country. Amid Hindutva complaints that many of the supposed intruders are Hindu, the government plans a law that, in a worrying challenge to the secular constitution, will accept refugees from nearby states as long as they are not Muslim. In the meantime Mr Shah, the home minister, has used the BJP lock on parliament to force through laws that reinforce powers of arbitrary arrest and weaken public oversight.
The prime minister has, to a large extent, already achieved a long-standing goal of Hindu nationalists, by cutting across caste and ethnic boundaries to forge an unusual degree of unity among Hindus. But in doing so he has deepened yet another of India's divides. For decades the country's underlying debate has been about whether to be strong by embracing diversity as a nation of citizens with equal rights or by fashioning India as a Hindu state.
Many, perhaps even most, of his own voters may not have intended it, but Mr Modi's election victory has settled that debate in favour of Hindutva. And Mr Modi may not have intended it, but at street level the shifting balance can be seen in cruder form, as Hindu vigilante groups violently enforce bans against the slaughter of cows, or simply harass people who too obviously belong to the world's largest minority, India's 190m Muslims.
The underlying message is that either Muslims submit, or they fight and we crush them, says Harsh Mander, who runs a group working with victims of communal violence. He fears the country has rejected ideals of kindness and consensus in favour of selfrighteous force. ""When there were riots in Delhi after Partition, Mahatma Gandhi said he would not leave the city until there is not a single Muslim child who would feel afraid here,"" he says. ""And look where we are now.""","The prime minister

BUENOS AIRES
Alberto Fernández, the newly elected president, will struggle to clean up the mess his Peronist movement made
""We will devote all our efforts to W ending the suffering of all Argentines,"" declared Alberto Fernández, Argentina's president-elect, before a crowd in Chacarita, a working-class area of Buenos Aires. Mr Fernández was celebrating his victory over the incumbent, Mauricio Macri, in a presidential election on October 27th. But Mr Macri raised similar hopes after his election four years ago, which ended 14 years of rule by the Peronist movement to which Mr Fernández belongs.
The victory by the Peronists-who secured 48% of the vote against Mr Macri's 40% with most of the votes counted-was narrower than expected but large enough to avoid a run-off vote in December. The question is whether they can do a better job of resolving the country's chronic economic troubles than Mr Macri did.
The election offered voters a choice between two failed models. Mr Macri's supposedly business-friendly presidency is ending with a shrinking economy, a falling currency and rising prices. But the years of populist rule by the Peronists that preceded it were at least as bad. The author of the previous Peronist disaster, Cristina Fernández de Kirchner (no relation to Mr Fernández), will now be vice-president. When it became clear after a primary vote in August that the Fernández duo would win, the peso plunged by 25% and inflation surged. Even as the winners were chalking up the votes on October 27th, shopkeepers were marking up prices, anticipating further devaluation and higher inflation.
Nerves have since settled. The peso strengthened a bit against the dollar in the black market in the days following the election. Mr Macri, conceding defeat, invited the president-elect immediately to the Casa Rosada, the presidential palace. The hope is that the two can agree a ""transition package"" to keep the markets steady until Mr Fernández takes office in December. They have already signed off on tighter currency controls, limiting dollar purchases to just $200 a month, to prevent a possible run on the peso. That is much lower than the $10,000 limit imposed in September.
The election did not resolve the question of which Fernández would truly succeed Mr Macri: Alberto, the presidentelect, or Cristina, the charismatic former president who elevated Alberto from backstage operative to presidential frontman.
The early signs are mixed. In the closing days of the campaign, Mr Fernández insisted he and his running-mate were inseparable. ""But that was the candidate speaking,"" said one of his inner circle, as the president-elect celebrated his victory. ""He knows he has to cut the cord if he is to stabilise this economy, and win time for recovery from this economic mess."" Mr Fernández has already signalled that he will seek a pact with businesses and unions to contain inflation. Entrepreneurs sound receptive. ""Count on me, especially when it comes to a social pact,"" said one of Argentina's biggest soya farmers, Gustavo Grobocopatel, who had backed Mr Macri.
One clue to Mr Fernández's intentions will be his choice of treasury minister. The two leading candidates, Matías Kulfas and Guillermo Nielsen, are veterans of the Kirchners' rule (and members of Mr Fernández's transition team). But their reputations differ. Mr Nielsen has encouraged bondholders and the imf to show patience with the new government. He cites the ex-1 * ample of Uruguay, which repaid its creditors after a crisis in 2002 slowly, but without subjecting them to a ""haircut"". That may not work in Argentina given the size of its debts (near 90% of gdp, according to jPMorgan Chase) and its weak currency. But investors welcome the sentiment.
Mr Nielsen, who led Argentina's negotiations with the IMF from 2003 to 2005, may reprise that role as Argentina seeks to revise the terms of its existing $57bn loan from the fund. That may make Mr Kulfas, a general manager of the central bank during Ms Fernandez's presidency, the favourite for the top economic job. He is viewed as a traditional Peronist in his economic thinking. ""So expect protectionism, interventionism, strict currency controls to limit capital flight,"" said a former senior official. A big job for Cecilia Todesca, a moderate who served alongside Mr Kulfas at the central bank, would be a reassuring signal.
Other election results will have a bearing on the struggle for power within the Peronist government. The province of Buenos Aires, home to almost 40% of Argentina's population, elected Axel Kicillof as governor. A former economy minister under Ms Fernández, he will have an influential voice. And it is not an entirely reassuring one. ""The economic situation we inherit today represents scorched earth, the ultimate failure of neoliberalism,"" Mr Kicillof declared at the Peronists' victory celebration.
Even so, other results suggest those scorching ""neoliberals"" may have a say in how Argentina is governed. A member of Mr Macri's party won re-election as mayor of the city of Buenos Aires by a huge margin. Mr Macri's coalition looks likely to form the largest group in the lower house of congress (although Mr Fernández's alliance will control the senate).
""The good news is we have two broadly based coalitions coming out of this,"" concluded Sergio Berensztein, a political analyst. The Peronists will have to seek allies rather than berate their enemies. With luck, Mr Macri will have left a political legacy of ""conversation, not conflict"".
Mr Fernández's foreign policy may be more ideological than his economic policy. His first foreign trip as president-elect will be to visit Mexico's populist president, Andrés Manuel López Obrador. Relations with Brazil, Argentina's biggest neighbour, are off to a frosty start. Jair Bolsonaro, Brazil's right-wing president, refused to congratulate him on his election victory.
""All I care about is that the Peronists and Cristina will look after us once again,"" said Marta Moreno, a housewife at Mr Fernández's victory rally. The poster in her hand recalled an election victory of 73 years ago. It bore the image of Eva Perón, General Juan Perón's wife, who is still popular with those who want leaders to look after them. ?","Argentina

All about Evo
Evo Morales quit as Bolivia's president after nearly 14 years in office. The chief of the armed forces had suggested he leave following widespread protests, which broke out after Mr Morales's victory in a dubious election on October 20th. Mr Morales accepted Mexico's offer of political asylum. Jeanine Áñez, a political foe of Mr Morales, took office as Bolivia's interim president. She has said she will hold fresh elections.
Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, Brazil's president from 2003 to 2010, was freed from prison, where he was serving a sentence for corruption, after the country's highest court decided that people convicted of crimes could not be jailed until they had used up all their appeals. Upon his release Lula attacked the right-wing government of Jair Bolsonaro.
Chile's president, Sebastián Piñera, agreed to begin the process of writing a new constitution. But protesters who are demanding reforms rejected his offer. They want an assembly of citizens, rather than congress, to draft the new document.
Dangerous days
Israel killed a senior commander of the Palestinian Islamic Jihad group in Gaza, setting off a wave of violence. Palestinian militants fired more than 150 rockets into Israel, which responded with air strikes. The fighting may increase the likelihood that the two main political parties in Israel will form a unity government, breaking two months of political deadlock.
Hassan Rouhani, Iran's president, claimed that a new oilfield containing 53bn barrels of crude had been discovered. If true, this would increase Iran's proven reserves, already one of the world's largest, by about a third. Iran has struggled to export oil since sanctions were reimposed by America last year.
The central bank of Zimbabwe began reissuing Zimbabwean dollars after a decade-long hiatus. The new notes are in effect the country's third currency in the past three years. The government has tried to stay a step ahead of a shortage of cash caused by high inflation and economic mismanagement.
Minority rapport
Spain's general election, the fourth in four years, gave no party a majority. The Socialists, who had been hoping to move closer to one, actually lost three seats. They swiftly struck a deal with the far-left Podemos party to attempt to form a coalition. Even together, the two parties will need to find support among several regional parties to get over the line.
Venice was hit by its worst floods for half a century. Water entered St Mark's Basilica, causing ""grave damage"", according to the city's mayor.
The Dutch government backtracked on previous pledges and reduced road speed limits to lookph (62mph) during the day to help meet a court-ordered reduction in emissions. Farmers have also been asked to cut back on livestock in order to reduce nitrogen.
In the British election campaign, Boris Johnson's Conservative Party got a boost when Nigel Farage, leader of the Brexit Party, said he would not field candidates in the 317 seats the Tories won in 2017. The pressure was on Mr Farage to go further and withdraw from all constituencies where his party threatens to split the Leave vote.

Why one of Africa's most ambitious farming projects has failed to thrive
SQUINT AT THE grasslands of northern Mozambique and they look a bit like the cerrado, a savannah in central Brazil. Could they be transformed by intensive farming, just as the thickets of the cerrado have given way to fields of soya that transformed Brazil from a food importer to one of the world's great breadbaskets? That was the thought behind Prosavana, a programme bringing Brazilian and Japanese expertise to Mozambique. Initiated in 2009, it aimed to lift agricultural production across an area of 107,000 square kilometres, roughly the size of Bulgaria.
Politicians heralded Prosavana as a landmark example of ""South-South"" cooperation. Few farming projects in Africa could match its ambition. It painted a future of which many agronomists on the continent dream: productive and commercially astute smallholder farmers and large plantations exporting to the world. Yet it became a study in hubris, and an illustration of why top-down schemes so often fall short of expectations.
Some 60% of people in sub-Saharan Africa earn a living from their fields. Most of them do not use improved seeds or fertiliser. A typical farm in Kenya or Uganda produces about one-third as much maize per hectare as one in China, and about onesixth as much as an American one. Africa also has much of the world's remaining uncultivated land. Stories of untapped potential are drawing commercial farming to the continent. Some agri-businesses cultivate vast holdings of their own. Others enter arrangements to buy cash crops from locals. They often run into opposition, not least over land. Many quietly retreat.
Prosavana encountered similar suspicion. A decade on there is nothing to show for it except a small research lab and a few model farms. In a field outside Ribaue, a northern town, farmers have been helped by technicians to check market prices and start a savings group. Onions grow in neat rows. But this is merely a scratch on an immense landscape. With the main phase of Prosavana not yet begun, the project has mostly had the effect of planting the seeds of a civil-society movement.
The first that many Mozambicans heard of Prosavana was an article in a Brazilian newspaper in 2011. ""Mozambique offers land to Brazilian soya"", ran the headline. The story described Mozambique as ""Brazil's next agricultural frontier"" and cited a claim by a Brazilian agronomist that half of northern Mozambique was ""unpopulated"". In 2013 a Prosavana planning document was leaked. Although it stressed the importance of small farmers, it also envisaged linking them to corporate farming clusters. A private-equity fund hoped to raise $2bn for related agri-business projects.
Activists denounced the scheme as a ""massive land grab"". They went on a study trip to the cerrado and joined forces with movements in Brazil and Japan, in a mirror of Prosavana's trilateral structure. An open letter calling for the suspension of the project was signed by 23 organisations in Mozambique and 43 abroad. Each side of the argument saw the other as out of touch and vaguely foreign-shills of evil corporations or dupes of clueless NGOs.
A gulf opened between two irreconcilable world-views. Many farmers in northern Mozambique practise shifting cultivation, moving to new lands when the soil needs a rest. Agronomists say that rapid population growth is making this impossible. Antonio Limbau, the Mozambican civil servant who oversees Prosavana, argues that farmers must use hybrid seeds and synthetic fertilisers to farm more intensively, so that ""the same piece of land feeds more people"".
Farmers call this argument patronising. ""We are not children,"" says Costa Estevao, who leads the peasant union in Nampula province. He says, accurately, that Prosavana aims to eliminate traditional ways of cultivation. He worries too about costly fertiliser and poisonous pesticides. Anabela Lemos, an environmental activist, says that governments and corporations want ""to destroy the campesina"", or peasant class. ""That's a big mistake, because they're the ones who feed the world,"" she says.
This kind of rhetoric reflects a ""persistent misunderstanding"" of the project, sighs Hiroaki Endo, who heads the Japanese aid agency in Mozambique. Technocrats are still redrafting their master plan, which they say will benefit small farmers. But whatever emerges from endless consultations will fulfil neither the hopes nor the fears invested in it. Brazilian farmers lost interest in Mozambique when they discovered the land was less empty than they thought. And they have since opened a new agricultural frontier back home, where the government of Jair Bolsonaro is letting the forest burn.
An unintended outcome of Prosavana has been the strengthening of Mozambique's civil society, which forged new bonds through its campaign. Meanwhile in the northern grasslands, farmers invoke the ghost of the project to explain all kinds of unrelated mischief. Beside a road in Nampula province villagers recount the visit of a strange man who gave no name but asked for 50 hectares of their land. The tracks of his bulldozer are still imprinted in the earth. Who is he? Will he come back? Locals have no idea, but the word on their lips is ""Prosavana"".","Seeds of opposition

SÃO PAULO
Jair Bolsonaro is hemmed in by congress, his advisers and his own misjudgments
The presidents of Brazil's two houses of congress live side by side in modern mansions in Brasilia, the capital. In May they built a door in the wall that divides their gardens, so they could meet without attracting notice. The political mood was fevered. A scandal involving the oldest son of President Jair Bolsonaro was dominating the news. Worries about whether the government would reform the unaffordable pension system had pushed the real, Brazil's currency, to less than 25 American cents for the first time since October.
The garden-gate gambit seemed to work. On October 22nd congress enacted a constitutional reform of the pension system that will save the government 800bn reais ($196bn) over ten years, about 10% of this year's gdp. The change is a big step towards solving two of the country's main problems: a massive public debt; and state spending that is both too high and skewed towards transfers and salaries. (The real remains weak for other reasons.)
Mr Bolsonaro, a right-wing populist who has been in office since January, had little to do with the reform. The fight was led by Rodrigo Maia, the president of the lower house of congress, and his counterpart in the senate, Davi Alcolumbre. Their main ally in government was the pro-market economy minister, Paulo Guedes. The president, normally the main pitchman for any reform, kept a low profile.
His bystander role is one of the many oddities of his administration. Brazilians elected the former army captain, until 2017 an obscure congressman with a fondness for dictators, to express anger at crime, ruption and decline. Although he entered office sounding like a strongman, he has been hemmed in by congress, by his advisers and by his own ill-judged behaviour and that of his family. This balance of forces has contained some of his dangerous impulses while allowing better policies, like pension reform, to get through. It has also frustrated progress in areas where voters most expect it. Mr
Bolsonaro's plans for fighting crime and corruption are in tatters. Unemployment is high and economic growth remains sluggish. The president's approval rating is an unimpressive 35%. His socially conservative agenda, which includes loosening guns laws and curbing ""socialism"" in schools, has made little progress, even though he seems to care most about it. In other areas he has reversed himself: for example, he has dropped his earlier hostility towards China. The
clearest way in which Mr Bolsonaro has put his stamp on Brazil is negative. On November 18th the space agency reported that the pace of deforestation of the Amazon had risen by nearly 30% in August 2018July 2019 from the same period a year before. It reached its highest level since 2008. He has been a cheerleader for economic development in the Amazon and weakened enforcement of environmental laws. The
splintering of power in Brasília makes it hard to guess how the remaining 1 1 * three years of Mr Bolsonaro's presidency will play out. The release from jail on November 8th of Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, who was Brazil's president from 2003 to 2010, gives the left-wing opposition the leader it has lacked until now. Some observers wonder whether scandals surrounding Mr Bolsonaro's sons, who are given to anti-democratic rants, will bring his presidency to an early end.
Optimists think that strife and chaos in Brasilia will not hinder reforms, and might even help. A member of the government's economic team contends that Mr Bolsonaro's preoccupation with fighting culture wars serves as a ""smokescreen"" that allows Mr Guedes and Mr Maia to take the lead on economic legislation. In congress there is an ""an unprecedented consensus that we must make progress on the economic agenda, independent of the government"", says the lower-house leader, Mr Maia.
That consensus may not hold. This month Mr Guedes proposed a trio of constitutional changes, including one to make it possible to freeze public servants' pay in a fiscal emergency. But he did not tell congress which to prioritise. An overhaul of the enterprise-crushing tax system is ""necessary"", says Aguinaldo Ribeiro, who is coordinating one in the lower house, ""but no one can agree on the details"".
The mood may be shifting against the state-slimming reforms favoured by Mr Guedes. ""No one is talking about health or education policy,"" says Tabata Amaral, who belongs to a ""parliamentary front"" of firsttime legislators who defied their parties to vote in favour of pensions reform. They want action to improve social services. The window for reforms is closing, warns Zeina Latif of xp Investimentos, a broker.
On measures to fight corruption it has slammed shut. Mr Bolsonaro had raised hopes by naming as his justice minister Sergio Moro, who as a federal judge had led the Lava Jato (Car Wash) investigations. These led to the conviction of scores of politicians and businessmen. Mr Moro convicted Lula, the most prominent of the Lava Jato miscreants.
But now all three branches of government are working against the anti-corruption agenda. Mr Bolsonaro has lost enthusiasm, perhaps because his son Flávio, a Rio de Janeiro senator, is a target of a money-laundering probe. Mr Moro has been hurt by revelations that as a judge he collaborated improperly with prosecutors. His omnibus bill to fight crime and corruption is stuck in a lower-house committee. ""Moro's agenda is dead,"" says Eduardo Cury, a legislator from Sāo Paulo. It cannot help that dozens of legislators besides Flávio Bolsonaro are under investigation.
The judiciary itself has dealt Lava Jato a blow. This month the supreme court ruled that convicts should remain at liberty until they exhaust their appeals, the decision that led to Lula's release. That threatens the investigations, whose success is based largely on plea bargains by suspects who avoid jail by implicating other wrongdoers. Now witnesses can put off prison instead by appealing their verdicts.
""There's little appetite"" for Mr Bolsonaro's socially conservative agenda, says Fernando Bezerra, the government's leader in the senate. In the face of congressional opposition the president withdrew a decree to allow millions of Brazilians to carry guns. The legislature has also pushed back against destruction of the Amazon. As wildfires raged in September Mr Maia pushed through the lower house a measure to compensate small farmers and indigenous groups for preserving forest.
Congress's more assertive role is among the bigger surprises of Mr Bolsonaro's surprising presidency. ""For the first time the legislature is not just an appendix of the executive,"" says Michel Temer, who was Brazil's president from 2016 to 2018. That has helped economic reform. But congress cannot be trusted to contain corruption. Nor is it likely to still the chainsaws. ?","Jair Bolsonaro is hemmed in by congress , Jair Bolsonaro's advisers and Jair Bolsonaro's own misjudgments 
 The presidents of Brazil 's two houses of congress live side by side in modern mansions in Brasilia , the capital . In May they built a door in the wall that divides their gardens , so they could meet without attracting notice . The political mood was fevered . A scandal involving the oldest son of Jair Bolsonaro was dominating the news . Worries about whether the government would reform the unaffordable pension system had pushed the real , Brazil 's currency , to less than 25 American cents for the first time since October . 
 The garden - gate gambit seemed to work . On October 22nd congress enacted a constitutional reform of the pension system that will save the government 800bn reais ( $ 196bn ) over ten years , about 10 % of this year 's gdp . The change is a big step towards solving two of the country 's main problems : a massive public debt ; and state spending that is both too high and skewed towards transfers and salaries . ( The real remains weak for other reasons . ) 
 Jair Bolsonaro , had little to do with the reform . The fight was led by Rodrigo Maia , the president of the lower house of congress , and his counterpart in the senate , Davi Alcolumbre . Their main ally in government was the pro - market economy minister , Paulo Guedes . Jair Bolsonaro , kept a low profile . 
 Jair Bolsonaro's bystander role is one of the many oddities of Jair Bolsonaro's administration . Brazilians elected Jair Bolsonaro , to express anger at crime , ruption and decline . Although Jair Bolsonaro entered office sounding like a strongman , Jair Bolsonaro has been hemmed in by congress , by Jair Bolsonaro's advisers and by Jair Bolsonaro's own ill - judged behaviour and that of Jair Bolsonaro's family . This balance of forces has contained some of Jair Bolsonaro's dangerous impulses while allowing better policies , like pension reform , to get through . It has also frustrated progress in areas where voters most expect it . Jair Bolsonaro's plans for fighting crime and corruption are in tatters . Unemployment is high and economic growth remains sluggish . Jair Bolsonaro's approval rating is an unimpressive 35 % . Jair Bolsonaro's socially conservative agenda , which includes loosening guns laws and curbing "" socialism "" in schools , has made little progress , even though Jair Bolsonaro seems to care most about it .

Another week, and another Latin American country is out on the street. Now it is Colombia, where large protests have been taking place since November 21st. In other places, demonstrations have been triggered by specific things, even if the protesters' demands went beyond them-increases in metro fares in Chile and fuel prices in Haiti and Ecuador, and electoral fraud in Bolivia. But in Colombia there is just a pervasive feeling of discontent with an unpopular government. It has brought disparate groups onto the streets, from students, trade unionists and indigenous and gay activists to archaeologists against mining. A similar mood prevails in much of the region. The longer this goes on, the more it may paralyse governments.
The protests are not without precedent, nor are they confined to Latin America. In the early 2000s, elected governments were toppled in Argentina, Ecuador and Bolivia (twice, in disorders led by Evo Morales, who has just suffered the same fate). Huge protests erupted out of almost nothing in Brazil in 2013.
As in 1968, this is a time of global discontent, but it is particularly intense in Latin America. The protests are not its only manifestation. Popular anger showed up last year in electoral victories for contrasting populists, Jair Bolsonaro in Brazil and Andrés Manuel López Obrador in Mexico. The overarching trend of recent Latin American elections has been defeat for incumbents, confirmed in the return of Peronism in Argentina in October. In Uruguay Luis Lacalle Pou of the centre-right appears to have ended 15 years of rule by the centre-left in a presidential election on November 24th.
The causes of this ill humour include economic stagnation or slowdown, the diminishing of opportunity and the fear of falling back into poverty amid persistently deep inequality. The gap between rich and poor has not widened in Latin America, but it has become more visible. Take Chile, where the Costanera Centre, a shopping mall built around a priapic 64-storey office tower in Santiago, has been the target of anger. ""A person who earns 300,000 pesos [$375] a month sees a handbag that costs 4m pesos,"" says Marta Lagos of mori Chile, a pollster. Ferraris and Maseratis have arrived, their owners seemingly oblivious to poor housing, overcrowded buses and patchy health care.
Latin America's political class has been discredited by corruption and campaignfinance scandals. These, too, are more visible than in the past, thanks to more combative prosecutors, investigative journalists, whistleblowers and freedomof-information laws. In other words, the growth of transparency has outpaced that of good governance. Political parties, many of which are weakened and fragmented, have largely ceased to do their fundamental job of channelling discontent. The politicians have, in short, been overtaken by the street.
Diagnosis is easy but finding a cure will be much harder, as governments are discovering. Many of the problems are deep-rooted and their solutions longterm. Higher growth, more progressive tax, higher minimum wages and better social provision would assuage discontent. The problem is that growth depends on raising productivity, which requires unpopular reforms. And conservative elites resist paying more tax. The left in Chile and Colombia is staying on the street to win more concessions. In 1968 prolonged global disorder ended in a conservative reaction. That risk is especially high in Chile, where looting and vandalism continue.
The immediate official response has been to run for cover. In Ecuador Lenín Moreno's government cancelled the fuel-price rise and is struggling to get congress's assent to modest tax increases. Chile's government is fighting a rearguard action against demands for much higher public spending. In Colombia President Iván Duque may back away from mooted labour and pension reforms. In Brazil Mr Bolsonaro postponed a bill that would trim salaries and jobs in the bloated public sector because of fears it might trigger protests.
Reform has rarely been easy in Latin America. More presidents may imitate Martín Vizcarra in Peru. In 20 months in office he has ducked unpopular decisions, such as approving a big mine. Riding an anti-politician wave of anger, he shut down an obstructive congress. Along with Mr López Obrador, he is one of only four Latin American presidents with an approval rating of over 50%. Crowd-pleasing gestures can quiet the streets. They postpone discontent, but they will not diminish it.","Protests will deter governments from making unpopular but necessary decisions

But Alberta's secessionist movement spells trouble for Justin Trudeau
The 700 people who gathered on a recent Saturday night at the Boot Scootin' Boogie Dancehall in Edmonton, the capital of the western Canadian province of Alberta, came not to boogie but to vent. Baseball caps for sale bore such slogans as ""Make Alberta Great Again"", ""The West Wants Out"" and ""Wexit"". On stage, before a Canadian flag held between hockey sticks and pointed upside down, Peter Downing recited the grievances that drew the crowd: cancelled plans to build oil pipelines, subsidies paid to the rest of Canada and snobbery towards Alberta from the central Canadian provinces. The country's prime minister, Justin Trudeau, would get what's coming to him, Mr Downing pledged. Someone near the back muttered, ""Hopefully, a bullet.""
The anger at the Boot Scootin' would be easy to ignore, except that it will be one of the dominant themes of Mr Trudeau's second term in office, which began when he narrowly won re-election in October. His Liberal Party was wiped out in Alberta and in its equally resentful neighbour, Saskatchewan. Mr Trudeau appointed Albertaborn Chrystia Freeland, the foreign minister in the last government, to be deputy prime minister and minister of intergovernmental affairs. One of her main jobs will be to soothe western feelings. Canada's governor-general was expected to outline the government's ideas for bridging regional divisions, among other priorities, in a ""speech from the throne"" as The Economist went to press on December 5th. They are unlikely to include a big reduction in Alberta's net transfers to the rest of the country. But its drive for greater autonomy could be a model for reshaping how the federation works.
Alberta's 4m people are Canada's richest. The province is a motor for the national economy when oil prices are high. It is a big net contributor to the federal budget and to other provinces. Alberta was also the fulcrum of Mr Trudeau's climate and energy policies. He had hoped to win its support for a national price on carbon by approving the expansion of the Trans Mountain oil pipeline to the country's west coast. The province rejected this grand bargain by scrapping the carbon tax on consumers.
Though rich, Alberta has had a run of bad luck. It began when global oil prices fell in 2014, causing a recession and a jump in unemployment to a high of 9% in 2016 (see chart on next page). The economy has since recovered, but Alberta still struggles to sell its oil. In part that is because existing pipelines are full. This forces producers to ship oil expensively by train to the United States, where it competes against cheaper American shale oil, or to store it. Extracting oil from Alberta's oil sands consumes a lot of energy, and it is harder to refine than lighter crudes. Each barrel contributes more to climate change than does one from most other sources.
These problems have led to an exodus of oil companies. Shortly after the election Encana said it would move its head office from Calgary, Alberta's business centre, to Denver. It is changing its name to Ovintiv. In November this year Sweden's central bank said it would sell its holdings of bonds issued by Alberta because its carbon footprint is too large. Royal Dutch Shell has 1 2 sold almost all its oil-sands assets.
Albertans blame many of these setbacks on Mr Trudeau. He is the son of a prime minister, Pierre Trudeau, who during the 1970s and 1980s forced Alberta to sell its oil domestically at a discount to world prices. Although Mr Trudeau's government bought the Trans Mountain pipeline and the project to expand it, which is to begin laying pipe this month, it has vetoed other pipeline projects. Canada needs to phase out the oil sands, he has said. The national carbon price, which will be imposed on Alberta after it scrapped its own scheme, is another insult to the oil patch. Albertans are just as angry about an overhaul of the law for giving regulatory approval for infrastructure projects, including pipelines. This gives the public more say and obliges builders to consider such issues as climate change and gender equity.
A third of Albertans now think they would be better off outside Canada, the highest level on record, according to a poll by Ipsos. In November advocates of Wexit-western exit-applied to be recognised (by the federation they want to leave) as a political party. Wexit Canada imagines that if Alberta secedes, neighbouring British Columbia-which resembles California the way Alberta does Texas and has a coast-will have no choice but to join it.
Alberta's leaders, and most Albertans, are more realistic. Among the hurdles on the road to separation are old treaties signed by indigenous First Nations with Canada's rulers. These would be difficult to change. Moreover, separatist sentiment caused one firm to cancel plans to put its headquarters in Calgary. That cost the city 1,000 jobs, says its development agency.
Last month the province's canny Conservative premier, Jason Kenney, argued that separation would landlock Alberta's oil. He said he would host town halls and convene a panel with a more modest aim: to devise a ""fair deal"" for Alberta within Canada. This is likely to be a package of measures that the province can take unilaterally. They may give Alberta a status within the confederation closer to that of Quebec, the French-speaking province.
Mr Kenney's fair deal is likely to include a new force to take over provincial policing. Quebec and Ontario already have forces that operate alongside the Royal Canadian Mounted Police. Alberta, rather than the central government, might collect revenues destined to be spent within the province, as Quebec now does. The province may also try to opt out of some federal programmes, such as the Trudeau government's plan to pay for patients' prescriptions. Alberta could withdraw from the Canadian Pension Fund as long as, like Quebec, it sets up one with comparable benefits. That might lower Albertans' contributions (because its population is relatively young) and raise those of other Canadians. Many of these measures would increase administrative costs, which is one reason the province has rejected such ideas in the past. Quebeckers, for example, complete two tax returns.
On most money matters Alberta can do little on its own. Since 2000 the difference between what it has sent to the federal government and what it receives in transfers and services has amounted to 8% of the province's gdp. Much of the anger focuses on ""equalisation"", a transfer from rich provinces to poorer ones, mainly Quebec, that is supposed to even out social spending. During the provincial election campaign in May, Mr Kenney promised to hold a referendum on equalisation if the federal government did not expand the Trans Mountain pipeline.
It would have no legal force. Mr Trudeau is unlikely to cut Alberta's subsidy to the rest of Canada, even though it largely derives from oil dollars. Nor is he likely to scrap his environmental policies. He and Ms Freeland will no doubt seek other ways to placate the west. But these will probably not overcome its sense of alienation. Wexiteers may be gathering at the Boot Scootin' dance hall for years to come. ?

To all appearances they are opposites and foes. Brazil's Jair Bolsonaro is a foul-mouthed former army captain of the hard right. Mexico's Andrés Manuel López Obrador is a would-be revolutionary of the left. Mr Bolsonaro appeals to the worst in Brazilians, with his diatribes against women and gays, casual racism and fondness for guns and chopping down the Amazon's trees. Mr López Obrador (known as amlo) invokes the noble purpose of making Mexico fairer and less unequal. Yet for all their differences, the two most important presidents in Latin America are strikingly similar in many ways. After roughly a year in office, each faces difficulties.
Both are reactionaries in the purest sense, conjuring up an imagined golden past. Mr Bolsonaro lionises Brazil's military dictatorship of 1964-85. amlo, who stresses that he is a democrat, believes that everything was better in Mexico before a turn to ""neoliberalism"" in the 1980s. Both are nationalists with little interest in the outside world and would rather the outside world reciprocated. They are believers, and have inserted religion into the political discourse of hitherto secular states. Mr Bolsonaro, a Pentecostal protestant, campaigned on the slogan ""Brazil above all, God above everyone"", amlo implicitly compares himself to Christ, who was ""sacrificed ...for defending the poor"". Both defend traditional family values, though they see different threats to them: left-wing political correctness in Mr Bolsonaro's case, neoliberalism for amlo. Although Mr Bolsonaro, whose cabinet is stuffed with officers, more obviously relies on military help, amlo has also bolstered the army's role. He called it ""the people, in uniform"" and put a retired general in charge of a new National Guard.
Neither has much respect for the separation of powers. During Mr Bolsonaro's election campaign one of his sons, Eduardo, said it would take only ""a soldier and a corporal"" to close the supreme court. Both Eduardo and Paulo Guedes, the economy minister, have mused about reviving A1-5, a decree under which the dictatorship suspended freedoms and purged congress. In Mexico AMLO's government strongarmed a supreme-court justice into resigning. His critics fear that he will take control of the electoral authority when new members are chosen next year. Both men dislike ngos, which they see as meddlers. Mr Bolsonaro has made preposterous claims that ngos (and Leonardo DiCaprio, an American film star) were behind fires in the Amazon. amlo cancelled government funding to outfits providing child care and fighting people-trafficking.
Both presidents were elected on similar promises: to revive their economies and, by force of will, eliminate corruption and crime. They are going about these tasks differently, and with varying success. The efforts of Mr Bolsonaro's economic team to shrink unsustainable fiscal commitments have found support in congress, despite the president rather than because of him. The economy grew by 0.6% in the third quarter compared with the second. Mexico had a solid fiscal position. But amlo introduced his own version of austerity, cutting government salaries and what he sees as waste. He and private business are suspicious of each other. Mexico's economy has sunk into a mild recession.
On crime, Mr Bolsonaro can be blamed for a rise in killings by police, which he has encouraged. He can take little credit for a sharp fall in overall murders this year, which began before he took office and owes much to the end of a vendetta between drug syndicates. amlo has even less to crow about: Mexico's murder rate continues to rise, with massacres by drug gangs almost every month. His policy of ""hugs, not bullets"", of helping unemployed young people, shows no sign of working. He has failed to strengthen corruption-fighting institutions. Mr Bolsonaro's government has tried to block an investigation that has revealed links between his sons and paramilitary militias in Rio de Janeiro.
What really unites these seemingly contrasting presidents is that both are populists. They see themselves as saviours, and claim a special bond with ""the people"". Measured by popularity, amlo is the winner. His approval rating is 68% compared with 42% for Mr Bolsonaro. How long will that last? Mr Bolsonaro, who has outsourced economic policy to Mr Guedes, knows what he doesn't know, while amlo thinks he knows better than anyone else. Brazil has more checks on presidential power than does Mexico. That means amlo has nobody else to blame as things start going wrong.","The surprising similarities between the presidents of Brazil and Mexico

BUENOS AIRES
The new president wants to boost growth while pushing down inflation. That will be hard
ALBERTO FERNáNDEZ drove himself and his girlfriend, Fabiola Yáñez, to congress for his inauguration as Argentina's president in their Toyota. That gesture, as much as anything he said in his hour-long speech, signalled that he intends to swiftly help ordinary Argentines who are suffering from recession, high inflation and rising poverty. But some wondered, as the Peronist accepted the presidential sash and baton from Mauricio Macri, his centre-right predecessor, whether he would drive the country forwards or backwards.
The question was provoked in part by the presence of Cristina Fernández de Kirchner, the new vice-president, who preceded Mr Macri as president. Ms Fernández, a populist who governed from 2007 to 2015, created the economic mess whose clean-up Mr Macri botched. She has been indicted in nine separate court cases for acts of corruption and other misdeeds. In the new administration she has already amassed unprecedented influence for a vice-president. The new president (no relation to Ms Fernández) wants to be a crowdpleaser as she was, at least for poor Argentines, but without repeating her mistakes. That will be tricky.
The ""social catastrophe"" that Mr Fernández promises to end is real. Two-fifths of Argentina's citizens cannot afford a monthly basket of staple goods. The yearon-year inflation rate exceeds 50%. Argentina's $57bn bail-out from the imf is the largest in the fund's history. Mr Fernández promises to put the economy ""back on its feet"". But an adviser to the new president admits: ""There are no easy answers on the economy, and no good options.""
Mr Macri's bet was that he could restore the confidence that Ms Fernández had battered, which would lead to growth. On taking office in 2015 he lifted exchange controls brought in by Ms Fernández, reached an agreement with foreign creditors (with whom she had fought) and lowered her punishing taxes on exporters. That approach failed, largely because Mr Macri did not cut the budget deficit fast enough to keep investors calm when global interest rates rose. The peso slumped and inflation soared (see chart on next page). The imf agreement in 2018 was a second stab at reviving confidence. But the austerity it demanded hit just as Argentina's political season was getting under way, weakening the economy and driving voters to Mr Fernández. That knocked the peso again.
The new president's big idea is to reverse Mr Macri's sequence: growth will lead to a revival of confidence rather than the other way round, he argues. To boost growth, he intends to bring back tools employed by Ms Fernández's administration-but to wield them more deftly.
The centrepiece of the economic programme is likely to be a restructuring of Argentina's $105bn debt to foreign bondholders (which does not include debt to the imf). This is to be carried out by the new economy minister, Martín Guzmán, an academic with little political experience who specialises in debt negotiation. He has proposed that Argentina defer payment of both interest and principal for the next two years. Analysts assume he will end up demanding bigger concessions from creditors. Bond prices suggest the markets are expecting an implicit haircut-a discount on the bonds' face value-of nearly 50%. ""Every dollar we don't use for debt will go to consumer-led recovery at home,"" Mr Guzmán has told his new colleagues.
The idea of paying foreign creditors less than they are owed is bound to be popular. So, too, will be Mr Fernández's plans to boost wages for public-sector and low-paid workers and raise pensions.
Ideas for reining in inflation are unorthodox. The new government may keep a cap on utility prices that was due to expire at the end of 2019. It is expected to keep capital controls introduced by Mr Macri as an emergency measure to curb the depreciation of the peso, and to reach a pact with employers and trade unions to hold down prices and wages. (This may mean that salaries will rise by less than Mr Fernández has implied.)
The big question is whether such a package can exclude the growth-clobbering stuff that the Peronists campaigned against. That is unlikely. The new government does not want to draw down the remaining $iibn of its imf loan, but will still have to deal with the fund. The imf is likely to welcome a cut in the private-sector debt burden (making it easier for Argentina to repay the fund). Both sorts of creditor are likely to insist on a primary fiscal surplus, ie, before interest payments, which means more austerity than Mr Fernández has in mind. There is worried speculation that the central bank will pay for promises such as higher pensions by printing money, even though its new president, Miguel Pesce, is thought to be a safe choice. If either fiscal or monetary policy is too loose, that will push up inflation in spite of the bodges being planned to contain it.
Although Mr Fernández is bringing back into use some of the techniques used by his Peronist predecessor, he is keen to signal that he will not repeat her excesses. ""This is Alberto's economic team, and he will be in charge on this front,"" says an adviser. Yet the new president has not laid to rest fears that Ms Fernández will have undue influence. Mr Guzmán got the economy ministry after she vetoed two other candidates, says the presidential adviser.
She had a hand in the choice of the ministers of interior, defence and security. Her supporters will be in charge of the agencies that handle taxation, pensions and care of old people, which have big budgets and jobs to offer political allies. Her clout in these areas suggests that reforming the state will not be a priority. As vice-president, Ms Fernández is the senate's leader and commands the Peronist bloc in the chamber, where it has a majority. Her son, Máximo, leads the Peronists in the lower house of congress.
Ms Fernández also helped arrange the appointment of Carlos Zannini, one of her closest associates, as attorney-general. Mr Zannini was held in preventive detention for his alleged role in covering up a deal that Ms Fernández had made with Iran to absolve it of blame for the bombing of a Jewish centre in Buenos Aires in 1994 in which 86 people, including the bomber, died. His trial has been delayed indefinitely. Alberto Nisman, a prosecutor who was murdered in 2015, had indicted Mr Zannini. As attorney-general Mr Zannini, who was released from jail in 2018 and denies all charges, will lead the government's anticorruption unit and its team of lawyers.
Mr Fernández has already made clear that he is not concerned about the alleged misdeeds of his senior officials. He contends that Ms Fernández and jailed members of her government are victims of ""political persecution"". He has pronounced Mr Zannini innocent. ""We vindicate you,"" he told the new attorney-general.
Mr Fernández will revive aspects of his Peronist predecessor's foreign policy. The incoming foreign minister, Felipe Solá, has signalled ""re-engagement"" with Nicolás Maduro, Venezuela's leftist dictator, who will now be less of a regional pariah. Argentina's new government will not accept in its current form a trade deal negotiated by Mercosur, a four-country trade bloc, with the European Union. This will dampen Argentina's growth prospects in the long run and increase tension with Brazil, the bloc's biggest member. Mr Fernández and Jair Bolsonaro, Brazil's populist president, speak of having ""pragmatic relations"". But there is no hiding the frostiness. Mr Bolsonaro did not attend Mr Fernández's inauguration, sending his vice-president instead.
The Macri government is proud of having ended the economic isolation that Ms Fernández imposed on Argentina. ""We've spent four years taking Argentina out of the deep freeze,"" says Jorge Faurie, the outgoing foreign minister. ""The fear is we're going back."" Optimists think that the leftward shift in diplomacy will make it easier for Mr Fernández to adopt a moderate economic policy. Argentines must hope so.","Argentina

DELHI, LEXINGTON AND SÂO PAULO
Teenagers are rewriting the rules of news
The president of El Salvador gets it. Addressing the un General Assembly in September, Nayib Bukele paused to take a self-portrait at the rostrum. ""Believe me, many more people will see that selfie once I share it than will listen to this speech,"" he said, adding, ""I hope I took a good one.""
Marianne Williamson, a New-Agey type running for the Democratic presidential nomination in America, gets it. Asked after a debate in July whether it went well, she replied that she would only know for sure ""later, when I see the memes"". So does Andrew Yang, another Democratic no-hoper. His first big interview was with Joe Rogan, an internet-famous comedian with 6.96m subscribers on YouTube. After it was viewed im times over the course of two days, Mr Yang wrote that his campaign could be divided into ""br (Before Rogan) and ar (After Rogan)"".
These minor politicians provide a pithy summary of how teenagers and those in their early 20s consume news today. It is almost entirely on social media. It is almost entirely visual. And the content of the news-""President Makes Speech at un""-ís less important than how it is packaged. It is often filtered through humour or comment. Or, just as often, it is mediated by personalities who command huge followings among young people but are little known to the general population.
These principles hold true around the world, even if the specifics and platforms differ. Between 2009 and 2018 the share of teenagers who read newspapers declined from around 60% to close to 20%, according to the Programme for International Student Assessment (pisa), an educational league table of 15- and 16-year-olds in the oecd, a group of mostly rich countries. Young Indians are half as likely to visit timesofindia.com, India's biggest Englishlanguage news site, as older ones; they are also far more interested in videos and Bollywood news. In Britain, younger teens are far less familiar with the bbc's brand than they are with those of YouTube or Netflix. The public broadcaster ""will face a threat to its future sustainability if it cannot engage young people sufficiently"" according to Ofcom, the country's media regulator.
Some 80% of Arabs aged 18-24 years old now get their news from social media, up from 25% in 2015. They favour Facebook, though the Gulf states, particularly Saudi Arabia, are captivated by Snapchat. Twothirds of South Korean teenagers go online to find out what is happening in the world, and of them, 97% turn to Naver, a portal and search engine. According to Pew Research Centre, 95% of American teens have access to a smartphone and 45% are online ""almost constantly"". A study of American and British teens commissioned by the Reuters Institute for the Study of Journalism in Oxford argues that when it comes to news, young people are most concerned with ""what it can do for them as individuals-rather than society as a whole"".
It can be tempting to dismiss teenagers' news-consumption habits. Most cannot vote, have limited spending power and are probably incapable of finding El Salvador on a map. Such sneers are misplaced. A third of the planet is under 20. More than half the world is now connected to the internet. The young are a proxy for the future. That is especially the case in media businesses, where their habits drive billiondollar decisions, such as Facebook's acquisition of Instagram in 2012 and its failed attempt to buy Snapchat the following year.
Teenagers understand that technology gives them outsized power. Greta Thunberg, a teenage activist in Sweden, started the global ""school strike for climate"" which has now spread to 150 countries. Protests led by students, some still in high school, have erupted across the world, from Hong Kong to Chile. Politicians, policymakers and media executives should pay attention: how news is made, spread and consumed by teenagers today will determine what happens to their countries and businesses tomorrow. As one 13-year-old told Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, an American lawmaker, ""I'm not old enough to vote yet, but I can follow you on Instagram!""
To best understand this future, look to America. It has the world's most vibrant media ecosystem and is home to most of the platforms used by youth around the world, including Instagram, WhatsApp, Facebook, YouTube and Snapchat. (TikTok, wildly popular with younger teens, is Chinese and strictly moderated for political content.) American media wield influence around the world and are widely aped: the New York Times boasts readers everywhere; websites such as BuzzFeed have inspired similar clickbait sites in dozens of countries. And America's political and cultural vocabulary is pervasive. A meme that starts there has a good chance of spreading throughout the world.
The arena for those memes has changed. Since the 2016 presidential election in America Facebook has come under intense scrutiny for its role as a platform for news distribution. But to many Western teenagers the social network is deeply uncool. It is for old people. Nor do many of them hang out on Twitter, which plays an outsized role in journalism and politics only because it is full of journalists and politicians (and Donald Trump). They have little time for youth-focused websites such as BuzzFeed either. ""It's clearly adults trying to relate to young people,"" says Victoria, a 16-year-old in Kentucky. Teenagers deride outlets that just a few years ago were hailed as the next big thing: Griffin, a 16year-old from the Chinese city of Wuxi, dismisses Jinri Toutiao (""Today's Headlines""), China's most popular news app with 120m daily users, as clickbait for adults.
The action has shifted to Instagram (owned by Facebook), WhatsApp (ditto) and YouTube (owned by Google), each of which has well over a billion users. (Snapchat is popular in America but less so elsewhere.) Pew reports that 85% of American teenagers use YouTube; more than 70% use Instagram. Common Sense, an American non-profit group, found in a recent study that 69% of American teens watch online videos every day, mostly on YouTube. They spend nearly seven and a half hours a day looking at screens of all kinds.
Instagram is an odd destination for those seeking the news. Users post pictures to their ""grid"", mostly pretty ones. The app allows only one link per account-in the bio. And it has no formal reposting mechanism. But the introduction of ""Stories"" in 2016, which allowed its users to post shortlived images with annotations, added text to a largely visual platform, made sharing and reposting easier and supercharged its growth. Stories also allow those with more than 10,000 followers to share links to other material. Where users went, so did those who hope to influence them: advertisers, marketers, politicians, propagandists and miscellaneous mischief-makers have all piled into Instagram.
Consider the Amazon. By late August, anyone with an Instagram account anywhere in the world would have known that ""the Amazon rain forest-the lungs which produces 20% of our planet's oxygen-is on fire,"" as Emmanuel Macron, France's president, put it in a post on August 22nd that was liked by nearly 200,000 people. On the same day National Geographies account, the 11th-most followed on Instagram (126m followers), posted about fires in the Amazon, as did Leonardo DiCaprio (an American actor, 38m); Prilly Latuconsina (an Indonesian actress, 32m); and Malaika Arora (an Indian model, 10 m). Two days later nasa (51m) fanned the Instagram flames with a fresh satellite image.
This is fine
Posts about Amazonian fires were soon inescapable-as were allegations that big news outlets were ignoring it. ""It's the only thing I saw for weeks,"" says Dylan, a 17year-old pupil in Lexington, Kentucky. ""Whatever I saw about the Amazon I would share it,"" says Stacy, a 15-year-old Bostonian. Unscrupulous accounts tried to take advantage of the disaster, asking for donations or promising to plant a tree for every ""like"". The world's press subsequently ran articles, many of which debunked falsehoods on Instagram, such as Mr Macron's assertion that the Amazon produces 20% of the world's oxygen. In interviews conducted by The Economist with two dozen teens in Lexington, Kentucky and Boston, every one of them mentioned the fires unprompted. ""The fires in the Amazon were not getting very much coverage,"" says Olivia Seltzer, a 15-year-old Californian who two years ago started The Cramm, a newsletter for teenagers that goes out on Instagram and via email and text message. There is ""a lot of frustration that these kinds of stories aren't heard about. A lot of young people are taking it on to themselves to inform their peers.""
News outlets native to Instagram are also springing up. Not everything they cover is serious. @nowthisnews (2m followers) combines text overlaid on brief video clips about everything from political protests in Hong Kong to a dog with a tail on its head. (It also publishes on other platforms such as Facebook, Twitter and YouTube.) @houseofhighlights (15m) is dedicated to clips of American sports. In 2015 it was acquired by Bleacher Report, a large sports news website. Both accounts are in the top ten on Instagram for engagement, as measured by the number of likes and comments accrued, according to Axios, another news website. ""We've had the distinct advantage that we've never tried to take something that worked in a legacy medium and force fit it into the digital age,"" says Howard Mittman, Bleacher's ceo. Other outlets, he says, are like the ""divorced uncle who bought the right convertible in the wrong colour, who has cool clothes, but they just don't look good on him"".
Another hugely popular Instagram-native outlet is @theshaderoom (17m), which deals mostly in celebrity news and gossip (though it also posted about the Amazon fires). If tmz upended traditional celebrity reporting in the era of the blog, @theshaderoom is doing it again on social media. Sometimes the streams cross. ""I was scrolling a post about Cardi B""-a singer with 56m followers-""and the comments were like, 'Why aren't you talking about the Amazon?'"" says Jaliyah, a 15-year-old in Boston. Young people are ""very complicated in how they're consuming media"", says Samhita Mukhopadhyay, the executive editor of Teen Vogue. ""They can kind of toggle between Justin Bieber and they want to know exactly what Greta Thunberg is doing and they will show up to the rally.""
In the Arab world memes use cartoons or screen grabs from old movies to make light of political grimness. Elsewhere thousands of accounts changed their profile pictures this summer to a deep blue or striking red-the former to raise awareness about protests in Sudan and the latter to 1 tell people about the political situation in Kashmir. ""Activism has become one of the easiest ways to project yourself as cool,"" says Sadie, another Lexington teen. It is not uncommon to scroll through Instagram and find out about a high-profile divorce and a roiling protest in some remote corner of the world within the span of one second.
This weird mix of celebrities, politics and activism is another feature of modern news on social media: ""news"" now comes not only from accounts and outlets dedicated to the dissemination of journalism, but could be anything from a meme to the opinion of an online personality, such as PewDiePie, the world's most influential YouTuber, who mostly makes silly videos about video games and online culture. For five years he had the largest number of followers on the video-sharing platform, until he was overtaken by т-Series, an Indian record label, in April 2019. He is now second, with 102m subscribers. The combined print and digital circulation of every newspaper in America is about 30m. Daksha, a 13-year-old in Kentucky, spends her spare time making memes and posting them to a PewDiePie-themed community on Reddit, looking for the ""satisfaction that Lord PewDiePie reacted to my meme"" on his channel, she says.

Sarah, 16, from Kentucky, says that ""every boy on the debate team is into Ben Shapiro,"" a conservative controversialist with 876,000 subscribers on YouTube. In Germany a YouTuber called Rezo (1.16m subscribers) went viral with a rant against old and rich people and particularly the Christian Democratic Union, the party of Angela Merkel. Felipe Neto, a Brazilian YouTuber (35m) earns 30m reais a year ($7.5m). He started out telling jokes to adolescents but has evolved into a fierce critic of Jair Bolsonaro, the president. In September he made headlines for distributing 14,000 gayfriendly books at Rio de Janeiro's book fair after the city's evangelical mayor censored a graphic novel that featured a gay hero. Teenagers are, in short, getting their news from other young people who largely express their personal opinions and are barely any better informed than themselves.
As Mr Mittman puts it, teen news consumers are looking for ""a level of authenticity that allows you to know that they're speaking to you"". Other teenagers say they get their news from clips of late-night tv hosts, such as Trevor Noah or Stephen Colbert, or from stand-up comedians like Hasan Minhaj, who has a popular show on Netflix. Personalities are replacing news organisations. ""I feel like it's boring if it's an article. But if it's a video it's super engaging,"" says Dioneilys, 16, in Boston.
That opens the door to partisanship and misinformation. The Amazon-fire posts from the summer were riddled with errors. Personalities like PewDiePie and other YouTubers are routinely accused of making inflammatory comments or pulling tasteless stunts. Memes often bear little relation to fact. Many teens say they know all this but are sanguine about the dubious origins of their news. Sheer repetition is enough to convince some. ""I don't believe anything I read on social media,"" says Jaliyah in Boston. ""Unless it keeps coming, then maybe."" Others believe information if it comes from verified accounts. But many trust it as long as it comes from their friends.
Many Brazilians ""immediately believe in the authenticity of audio sent via WhatsApp by someone they know"", while furrowing their brows at a tape leaked to Folha de S. Paulo, a major newspaper, says Joel Pinheiro da Fonseca, a 34-year-old columnist for Folha. Realising that few young people were reading his column (or indeed any other section of his newspaper), Mr Pinheiro started a YouTube channel, where fans comment on his shaggy hair or home furnishings as often as on his political analysis. ""To them, the rudimentary quality makes it more authentic,"" he says. ""Young people want to establish a relationship with their sources of information.""
One consequence of a reliance on personalities is that the platforms on which they appear rather than publications become the sources of news. ""When your starting position is social-WhatsApp, Instagram, whatever-your loyalty to any given publisher is much lower,"" says Satyan Gajwani, who runs the digital arm of the Times Group, India's biggest media conglomerate. More than half a billion people visit its digital properties every month; more than 100m do so every day. ""How do we build enough confidence and trust in them that they become brand-loyal?"" he asks. Manvi, a 15-year-old in Delhi, exemplifies his worry. Her family subscribes to two Times Group newspapers but online she reads whatever ""pops up on the phone when I open Chrome"". Asked where the news comes from, she says, ""I don't know anything about that.""
A report from Ofcom found that ""when people consume news in this way, their engagement is typically fleeting."" Moreover, ""they are also less likely to be aware of the source of news content. Some younger people we spoke to didn't have a close association with the BBC, regarding it as just 'one of many' online news providers.""

For businesses, this presents both opportunities and challenges. Upstarts such as @houseofhighlights and @theshaderoom will spawn imitators around the world, just as BuzzFeed did for a previous generation. Media organisations such as the BBC, India's Times Group or America's Turner, which owns Bleacher Report, will be forced to invest and acquire their way to relevance. The big risk is that they could do that and still fade as trust in big brands declines. Either way, young people will continue to spend enormous amounts of time online. ""Social media basically controls every aspect of our lives,"" says Stacy, a 15-yearold Bostonian.
For societies, that is more worrying. YouTubers and Instagram personalities sign no editors' code of conduct, are uninterested in traditional practices of fairness or objectivity, and their motives are untainted by antiquated notions of public benefit. That gives information insurgents tremendous power. Governments and institutions cannot simply wish it away. Indeed, some already seem to feel they have little choice but to join the fray. In his speech to the un Mr Bukele said: ""Although we might not want to accept it and we might kick against it, the internet is increasingly becoming the real world."" ?","Young people and the media
DELHI, LEXINGTON AND SÂO PAULO
Teenagers are rewriting the rules of news
The president of El Salvador gets it. Addressing the un General Assembly in September, Nayib Bukele paused to take a self-portrait at the rostrum. ""Believe me, many more people will see that selfie once I share it than will listen to this speech,"" he said, adding, ""I hope I took a good one.""
Marianne Williamson, a New-Agey type running for the Democratic presidential nomination in America, gets it. Asked after a debate in July whether it went well, she replied that she would only know for sure ""later, when I see the memes"". So does Andrew Yang, another Democratic no-hoper. His first big interview was with Joe Rogan, an internet-famous comedian with 6.96m subscribers on YouTube. After it was viewed im times over the course of two days, Mr Yang wrote that his campaign could be divided into ""br (Before Rogan) and ar (After Rogan)"".
These minor politicians provide a pithy summary of how teenagers and those in their early 20s consume news today. It is almost entirely on social media. It is almost entirely visual. And the content of the news-""President Makes Speech at un""-ís less important than how it is packaged. It is often filtered through humour or comment. Or, just as often, it is mediated by personalities who command huge followings among young people but are little known to the general population.
These principles hold true around the world, even if the specifics and platforms differ. Between 2009 and 2018 the share of teenagers who read newspapers declined from around 60% to close to 20%, according to the Programme for International Student Assessment (pisa), an educational league table of 15- and 16-year-olds in the oecd, a group of mostly rich countries. Young Indians are half as likely to visit timesofindia.com, India's biggest Englishlanguage news site, as older ones; they are also far more interested in videos and Bollywood news. In Britain, younger teens are far less familiar with the bbc's brand than they are with those of YouTube or Netflix. The public broadcaster ""will face a threat to its future sustainability if it cannot engage young people sufficiently"" according to Ofcom, the country's media regulator.
Some 80% of Arabs aged 18-24 years old now get their news from social media, up from 25% in 2015. They favour Facebook, though the Gulf states, particularly Saudi Arabia, are captivated by Snapchat. Twothirds of South Korean teenagers go online to find out what is happening in the world, and of them, 97% turn to Naver, a portal and search engine. According to Pew Research Centre, 95% of American teens have access to a smartphone and 45% are online ""almost constantly"". A study of American and British teens commissioned by the Reuters Institute for the Study of Journalism in Oxford argues that when it comes to news, young people are most concerned with ""what it can do for them as individuals-rather than society as a whole"".
It can be tempting to dismiss teenagers' news-consumption habits. Most cannot vote, have limited spending power and are probably incapable of finding El Salvador on a map. Such sneers are misplaced. A third of the planet is under 20. More than half the world is now connected to the internet. The young are a proxy for the future. That is especially the case in media businesses, where their habits drive billiondollar decisions, such as Facebook's acquisition of Instagram in 2012 and its failed attempt to buy Snapchat the following year.
Teenagers understand that technology gives them outsized power. Greta Thunberg, a teenage activist in Sweden, started the global ""school strike for climate"" which has now spread to 150 countries. Protests led by students, some still in high school, have erupted across the world, from Hong Kong to Chile. Politicians, policymakers and media executives should pay attention: how news is made, spread and consumed by teenagers today will determine what happens to their countries and businesses tomorrow. As one 13-year-old told Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, an American lawmaker, ""I'm not old enough to vote yet, but I can follow you on Instagram!""
To best understand this future, look to America. It has the world's most vibrant media ecosystem and is home to most of the platforms used by youth around the world, including Instagram, WhatsApp, Facebook, YouTube and Snapchat. (TikTok, wildly popular with younger teens, is Chinese and strictly moderated for political content.) American media wield influence around the world and are widely aped: the New York Times boasts readers everywhere; websites such as BuzzFeed have inspired similar clickbait sites in dozens of countries. And America's political and cultural vocabulary is pervasive. A meme that starts there has a good chance of spreading throughout the world.
The arena for those memes has changed. Since the 2016 presidential election in America Facebook has come under intense scrutiny for its role as a platform for news distribution. But to many Western teenagers the social network is deeply uncool. It is for old people. Nor do many of them hang out on Twitter, which plays an outsized role in journalism and politics only because it is full of journalists and politicians (and Donald Trump). They have little time for youth-focused websites such as BuzzFeed either. ""It's clearly adults trying to relate to young people,"" says Victoria, a 16-year-old in Kentucky. Teenagers deride outlets that just a few years ago were hailed as the next big thing: Griffin, a 16year-old from the Chinese city of Wuxi, dismisses Jinri Toutiao (""Today's Headlines""), China's most popular news app with 120m daily users, as clickbait for adults.
The action has shifted to Instagram (owned by Facebook), WhatsApp (ditto) and YouTube (owned by Google), each of which has well over a billion users. (Snapchat is popular in America but less so elsewhere.) Pew reports that 85% of American teenagers use YouTube; more than 70% use Instagram. Common Sense, an American non-profit group, found in a recent study that 69% of American teens watch online videos every day, mostly on YouTube. They spend nearly seven and a half hours a day looking at screens of all kinds.
Instagram is an odd destination for those seeking the news. Users post pictures to their ""grid"", mostly pretty ones. The app allows only one link per account-in the bio. And it has no formal reposting mechanism. But the introduction of ""Stories"" in 2016, which allowed its users to post shortlived images with annotations, added text to a largely visual platform, made sharing and reposting easier and supercharged its growth. Stories also allow those with more than 10,000 followers to share links to other material. Where users went, so did those who hope to influence them: advertisers, marketers, politicians, propagandists and miscellaneous mischief-makers have all piled into Instagram.
Consider the Amazon. By late August, anyone with an Instagram account anywhere in the world would have known that ""the Amazon rain forest-the lungs which produces 20% of our planet's oxygen-is on fire,"" as Emmanuel Macron, France's president, put it in a post on August 22nd that was liked by nearly 200,000 people. On the same day National Geographies account, the 11th-most followed on Instagram (126m followers), posted about fires in the Amazon, as did Leonardo DiCaprio (an American actor, 38m); Prilly Latuconsina (an Indonesian actress, 32m); and Malaika Arora (an Indian model, 10 m). Two days later nasa (51m) fanned the Instagram flames with a fresh satellite image.
This is fine
Posts about Amazonian fires were soon inescapable-as were allegations that big news outlets were ignoring it. ""It's the only thing I saw for weeks,"" says Dylan, a 17year-old pupil in Lexington, Kentucky. ""Whatever I saw about the Amazon I would share it,"" says Stacy, a 15-year-old Bostonian. Unscrupulous accounts tried to take advantage of the disaster, asking for donations or promising to plant a tree for every ""like"". The world's press subsequently ran articles, many of which debunked falsehoods on Instagram, such as Mr Macron's assertion that the Amazon produces 20% of the world's oxygen. In interviews conducted by The Economist with two dozen teens in Lexington, Kentucky and Boston, every one of them mentioned the fires unprompted. ""The fires in the Amazon were not getting very much coverage,"" says Olivia Seltzer, a 15-year-old Californian who two years ago started The Cramm, a newsletter for teenagers that goes out on Instagram and via email and text message. There is ""a lot of frustration that these kinds of stories aren't heard about. A lot of young people are taking it on to themselves to inform their peers.""
News outlets native to Instagram are also springing up. Not everything they cover is serious. @nowthisnews (2m followers) combines text overlaid on brief video clips about everything from political protests in Hong Kong to a dog with a tail on its head.

Brazil's president can boast some achievements. They come at a high price
When jair bolsonaro took office as Brazil's president on January 1st 2019, many observers feared the worst. The former army captain had made his name by extolling the military dictators who ruled from 1964 to 1985 and by disparaging women and gays. He won the election because voters were traumatised by the country's worst-ever recession, from 2014 to 2016, by crime and by revelations of corruption at the highest levels of politics and business. They hoped that Mr Bolsonaro would restore prosperity, peace and probity to Brazil.
After his first year in office they have some of what they wanted. The economy has improved, and violent crime has fallen. Yet Mr Bolsonaro has not put to rest the doubts raised by his unlikely rise to power. The provocateur has not become a statesman. Instead of strengthening Brazil's democratic institutions, he is testing them. When it comes to corruption and the environment, Brazil is either stuck or going backwards.
Mr Bolsonaro's main achievement is pension reform, a prize that has eluded Brazilian governments for decades and which congress agreed on in November. This will help remove a trap that Brazil set itself by paying lavish benefits to people who, on average, retire in their mid-50s. Without reform, pension spending as a share of gdp would have nearly doubled by 2050, with alarming consequences for public debt and the government's capacity to spend money on anything else. Brazil will now gradually introduce minimum retirement ages of 65 for men and 62 for women, and will reduce benefits as a share of people's earnings.
This has helped restore confidence in the economy. Interest rates have dropped to their lowest level in 33 years. Growth in 2020 should be at least 2%, well above the Latin American average. If Paulo Guedes, the Chicago-trained, pro-market economy minister, had his way, pension reform would mark the start of a transformation in Brazil's fortunes (see Americas section). He rightly believes that the state has kept Brazil poorer and more unequal than it should be, by spending too much money on the wrong things and subjecting businesses to needless rules and the world's most baffling tax system. He wants to privatise public enterprises, shrink a bloated administration, simplify taxes and transfer power and money to states and municipalities. In 2019 Mercosur (a four-country bloc including Brazil and Argentina) reached a trade agreement with the eu. If it is ratified, it could help Brazil shed its status as one of the world's more closed economies.
Mr Guedes urges the president's critics to focus on that. The top man has ""bad manners, but great principles"". It would be truer to say that Mr Bolsonaro, a fierce social conservative, has merely adopted Mr Guedes's economic creed, for the time being. In other spheres, his ideas cannot just be brushed aside, even if congress and the president's more level-headed advisers have so far contained his worst instincts. As long as he continues to endorse police violence, there is little chance of stopping its long upward trend. While left-wing protests were raging in other Latin American countries one of his sons, a congressman, said that if such protests turned violent in Brazil the government could revive a decree that shut congress during the dictatorship. In December, irritated by press accusations, the president turned on a journalist, saying, ""Your face looks an awful lot like a homosexual's, but that's no reason to accuse you of being a homosexual.""
Although murders have fallen, largely because inter-gang warfare has eased, Mr Bolsonaro has all but given up the fight against white-collar crime. Sergio Moro, the justice minister, has been compromised by revelations of his improperly close dealings with prosecutors when he was the judge in charge of the vast anti-corruption probe that helped propel Mr Bolsonaro to power. Congress stripped Mr Moro's crime bill of most of its anti-corruption measures. Prosecutors are investigating allegations that another of Mr Bolsonaro's sons, a senator from Rio de Janeiro, pocketed money meant for employees when he was a state legislator and has links to murderous ""militias"" of ex-policemen.
Then there is the environment. Early data suggest deforestation in the Amazon in the first 11 months of 2019 rose by 80% compared with 2018. Mr Bolsonaro sacked the chief of the space agency after it reported unwelcome deforestation data, and has hollowed out environmental-enforcement agencies and egged on ranchers and loggers who set fires to clear land. At recent global climate-change talks, Brazil played the wrecker.
If Mr Bolsonaro transforms the economy, Brazilians will have reason to be grateful. But they, and the world, will have paid a high and unnecessary price. ?","Jair Bolsonaro's can boast some achievements . They come at a high price

BRASILIA
Brazil's global image is worse. But the economy is doing better
Since jair bolsonaro became Brazil's president on January 1st 2019, he has quarrelled with an impressive array of foreign leaders and celebrities. After France's president, Emmanuel Macron, accused him of encouraging deforestation of the Amazon, Mr Bolsonaro called his wife ugly. When Greta Thunberg, a young Swedish climate activist, highlighted the murder of indigenous people in the Amazon, the Brazilian president called her a ""brat"". Michelle Bachelet, the un human-rights commissioner (and a former president of Chile), criticised a rise in killings by police in Brazil. Mr Bolsonaro responded by praising Chile's dictatorship of the 1970s and 1980s, which tortured her father.
These spats are a sign of the gulf between Brazil's far-right president, who has made a career out of attacking liberal ideas about tolerance, human rights and conservation, and the elites who espouse them. Mr Bolsonaro's put-downs suggest he does not mind causing offence. But senior officials in his government do worry, especially when ngos threaten to promote boycotts of Brazilian products and governments reconsider whether to ratify trade deals.
The world is ""misreading"" Mr Bolsonaro, said the economy minister, Paulo Guedes, during an interview in Brasilia, the country's capital, last month. He has ""bad manners, but great principles"". Mr Guedes hopes to change the conversation by shifting the focus from deforestation and police brutality to what he takes to be the president's main project, a radical transformation of the economy that will enrich all Brazilians, including the poorest. ""Instead of throwing stones at Brazil"" people should be applauding, he says.
There is much to admire in the plans that Mr Guedes described. But they do not answer some of the biggest doubts about Mr Bolsonaro's presidency. And it is unclear how much of the programme he will carry out. The applause may have to wait.
The vision is unapologetically liberal, or ""neoliberal"", as its left-wing critics call it. Mr Guedes blames most of Brazil's problems, including its high level of income inequality, on the overgrown state, which ""spends a lot of money on the wrong things"". Since the 1980s public expenditure as a share of gdp has trebled to 42%, a level similar to that of European welfare states. The quality of services is that of much poorer countries.
Red tape and a complex tax system thwart private enterprise, but the state also coddles some industries at the expense of everyone else. ""Forty years of closed markets"" have protected rent-seeking industries, he says. ""Imagine, 200m suckers being exploited by six banks, six shipping companies. Everything in Brazil is six."" Social security and free universities benefit the relatively well-off more than the poor.
Mr Guedes wants to wants to roll all this back. He proposes to simplify the tax system radically, while reducing rates and expanding the base; to privatise nearly all state companies; and, after cutting red tape to enable businesses to withstand competition, to open the economy to the world. Ordinary Brazilians, he contends, will benefit in two ways: from the jobs that a freer economy will create, and from spending that focuses more on what they need, such as infrastructure and education. Ideally, states would take over more responsibility from the federal government. Mr Guedes calls for ""more Brazil, less Brasilia"".
Mr Bolsonaro's government made a start on this agenda, with a constitutional reform of the pension system. This will save the government 855bn reais ($2iobn) over ten years and lessen the danger that public debt will reach crippling levels. As the reform took shape in 2019 confidence grew, leading to a recovery in investment (see chart). The economy grew by 0.6% between the second quarter and the third, more than expected. Annual growth for 2020 is forecast to be at least 2%. That may make Brazil one of Latin America's fastest growing economies.
But there are reasons to withhold applause. One is that the democratic governments that took over after the end of military rule in 1985 accomplished more than Mr Guedes gives them credit for. It was the Real Plan of Itamar Franco, president from 1992 to 1994, that finally licked inflation. Pension reform began under the left-wing Workers' Party, which governed from 2003 to 2016, and Mr Bolsonaro's predecessor, Michel Temer, put a constitutional cap on public spending.
It is not clear what will follow pension reform. Mr Guedes's plans are a ""wish list, rather than a reform strategy"", says Ricardo Sennes of Prospectiva, a consultancy. In November Mr Guedes delivered to congress proposals for three constitutional amendments that would curb spending in order to honour the constitutional limit. Congress may water them down.
Mr Bolsonaro recently told Mr Guedes to hold off on a public-sector reform that would have weakened civil servants' job security. The economy minister has not endorsed a tax-reform proposal that has support in the lower house of congress, but has yet to present an alternative. The president of the senate recently said that a proposal to privatise Eletrobras, the state electric utility, would not get through congress.
While Mr Guedes may be right to say that jobs are ""the most important element of social inclusion"", that does not excuse the poor performance of most ministries besides his. The education ministry, led by a conservative ideologue, accomplished almost nothing in 2019. The health ministry has been slow to replace thousands of Cuban doctors expelled by Mr Bolsonaro at the beginning of his term. They served mainly poor Brazilians in remote areas. Although the number of people living on less than $1.90 a day is at its highest since 2012, the government has not raised spending on Bolsa Familia, an income-transfer programme, enough to meet demand. Some 700,000 families are waiting for benefits. ""The poor are not a priority for this government,"" says Randolfe Rodrigues, the leader of the opposition in the senate.
Mr Guedes's defence of Mr Bolsonaro's democratic record is less convincing than that of his economic programme. ""We're a democratic regime,"" he says. But many Brazilians fear that the president's commitment to that idea is weak. He continues to express admiration for the generals who ruled Brazil from 1964 to 1985. One of his sons, Eduardo, a congressman, recently said that if left-wing protests spread to Brazil and got out of hand, the government could issue a decree like one that shut down congress during the dictatorship. Mr Bolsonaro responded to negative coverage in Folha de S.Paulo, a newspaper, by threatening to cancel government subscriptions to it. ""If Brazil takes an authoritarian turn, we will look back and say that the signs were all here,"" says Pedro Abramovay of Open Society Foundations, an ngo.
Congress has so far contained Mr Bolsonaro's authoritarian instincts. It has rejected or not scheduled for debate a dozen or so radical proposals, such as a bill that would allow millions of Brazilians to carry guns and a misconceived project to purge schools of leftist ideology.
Foreign critics focus less on the fate of democracy than on that of the forest. From January to November 2019 the Amazon lost 8,974 square km (3,465 square miles) of forest, an 80% rise over the same period in 2018, according to preliminary satellite data. Green groups accuse the government of weakening enforcement of environmental laws and encouraging loggers and ranchers to destroy the forest. That may spook foreign investors. ""They're afraid of being photographed with Bolsonaro,"" says Matias Spektor of Fundaçao Getulio Vargas, a university in Sāo Paulo.
Such concerns could also wreck Mr Guedes's hopes of opening up the economy through trade deals. Mercosur, a bloc dominated by Brazil and Argentina, signed a long-awaited accord with the European Union in June. But European anger about Brazil's environmental policies could jeopardise its ratification (as could the recent election of Alberto Fernández, a left-wing protectionist, as Argentina's president).
Progress on economic issues may be helping Mr Bolsonaro's reputation at home. So too is a reduction in the number of murders in 2019, although that has little to do with the president's policies. Brazil has so far been spared the wave of protests that struck such neighbouring countries as Chile and Ecuador late in 2019. That may be in part because Brazil had such convulsions in 2016 and 2016, when the economy was in recession and some of the country's most powerful politicians were being arrested for corruption. Public anger helped bring about the impeachment of one president, Dilma Rousseff, and eventually led to Mr Bolsonaro's election.
Now his family is dogged by scandal, and his vows to fight corruption are looking empty. A son, Flávio, a senator from Rio de Janeiro, is being investigated for money laundering. The president threatened to replace the director of the federal police after the investigation revealed links between Flávio and right-wing militia groups. Sergio Moro, the justice minister, failed to get through congress most of his proposals for curbing corruption. His credibility was undermined by revelations that when he was a corruption-fighting judge he had improperly close dealings with prosecutors.
Six months ago it appeared that the scandals would delay economic reforms, and possibly end Mr Bolsonaro's presidency early. There is little talk of that now. The streets are quiet. Mr Bolsonaro's approval rating slumped in the first half of the year but has stabilised at about 30%. The public seem willing accept reforms even if they are disenchanted with the politicians who are leading them. ""Brazilians are living through a distinct social moment in which society is favourable to change,"" says Paulo Hartung, the former governor of Espirito Santo, a state that underwent a tough fiscal adjustment in 2015. Brazil may advance, despite its brawling president.","A year of Jair Bolsonaro

SĂO PAULO
The charges against Glenn Greenwald are a threat to free speech
Last june the Intercept, a news site, published hacked messages that showed improper collaboration between Brazilian prosecutors and judges conducting the anti-corruption investigation known as Lava Jato (Car Wash). The leaks tarnished the image of Sergio Moro, the justice minister, who had been the judge in charge. They enraged Brazil's nationalist president, Jair Bolsonaro, whose election in 2018 owed much to anger about corruption.
On January 21st prosecutors filed charges against Glenn Greenwald (pictured), a co-founder of the Intercept. They accused him of belonging to a ""criminal organisation"" that hacked the mobile phones of members of the Lava Jato task-force. The judge overseeing the case may throw out the charges. Even so, they raise questions about how free the press will be in Mr Bolsonaro's Brazil and whether prosecutors will act independently.
Mr Greenwald, an American, became famous by helping publish Edward Snowden's leaks of information from the United States' National Security Agency. In July Mr Bolsonaro suggested that Mr Greenwald might ""do jail time"" for his Lava Jato revelations, and accused him of marrying his Brazilian husband to avoid deportation.

 The charges against Glenn Greenwald are a threat to free speech 
 Last june the Intercept , a news site , published hacked messages that showed improper collaboration between Brazilian prosecutors and judges conducting the anti - corruption investigation known as Lava Jato ( Car Wash ) . The leaks tarnished the image of Sergio Moro , the justice minister , who had been the judge in charge . They enraged Jair Bolsonaro's nationalist president , Jair Bolsonaro , whose election in 2018 owed much to anger about corruption . 
 On January 21st prosecutors filed charges against Glenn Greenwald ( pictured ) , a co - founder of the Intercept . They accused him of belonging to a "" criminal organisation "" that hacked the mobile phones of members of the Lava Jato task - force . The judge overseeing the case may throw out the charges . Even so , they raise questions about how free the press will be in Jair Bolsonaro's and whether prosecutors will act independently . 
 Mr Greenwald , an American , became famous by helping publish Edward Snowden 's leaks of information from the United States ' National Security Agency . In July Mr Bolsonaro suggested that Mr Greenwald might "" do jail time "" for his Lava Jato revelations , and accused him of marrying his Brazilian husband to avoid deportation . That month , after a rumour surfaced that investigators were scrutinising Mr Greenwald 's bank accounts , a supreme - court judge barred the authorities from investigating him .

BELÁGUA, MARANHÃO
A model anti-poverty programme has fallen on hard times
Last year Natália Ribeiro sent her fiveyear-old daughter to live with relatives because she could not afford to feed her. She had tried to sign up for Bolsa Família (Family Fund), a conditional cash-transfer programme that supports millions of poor Brazilians. That includes 80% of families in Belágua, a town of 7,000 people in Maranhāo, the poorest state. Ms Ribeiro should have been a shoo-in. She has no income. Her three children get regular health check-ups and will go to school, she promises. That is a precondition for receiving the monthly benefits, which start at 89 reais ($21). She has been waiting since May. ""I want a better life for my little ones,"" says the 24-year-old, who has long eyelashes like the baby in her lap and the toddler playing with a piece of wood on the floor.
In June last year Brazil's populist government, which had taken office five months before, slowed the acceptance of new beneficiaries and started cancelling payments to existing ones. The number of families admitted to Bolsa Família has dropped from 275,000 a month to fewer than 2,500. The number receiving benefits has fallen by im. The government says that 700,000 are on the waiting list, which may be an underestimate.
To critics of Jair Bolsonaro, Brazil's president, this is evidence of his indifference to poverty. Mr Bolsonaro once called Bolsa Família beneficiaries ""ignorant wretches"". As a candidate he tried to reassure them by promising 13 ""monthly"" payments in 2019 (copying the Brazilian tradition whereby formal workers get an extra month's pay at Christmas). His government did not budget for that extra payment, however, so it has had to cut the number of beneficiaries.
The economy minister, Paulo Guedes, vows to fight poverty in a different way from earlier, left-wing administrations. While trimming Bolsa Família, the government is making much bigger cuts to spending that benefits prosperous Brazilians. Smaller deficits and less debt will encourage economic growth by holding down interest rates. That will create jobs, which are better than handouts, Mr Guedes argues.
But the government's treatment of its flagship safety-net programme raises doubts. Growth alone is unlikely to banish poverty. Nor will it reduce inequality, which has been stratospheric for over a century. In 2018 the average income of the richest 1% of Brazilians was 33.8 times that of the poorest 50%, a ratio surpassed only in Qatar. The Gini coefficient, another measure of inequality, was 0.53 in 2017, on a scale where zero is perfect equality and 1 means that one person has all the income. Among large democracies, only South Africa does worse.
It does not have to be this way. Brazil has a big state. Taxes are a third of gdp, about the average for a rich country (which Brazil is not) and far above the Latin American average of 23%. The state's hefty resources could be used to lift up the poor. Public pensions, welfare payments and other transfers are a whopping 23% of Brazil's 1 GDP, even higher than in most rich countries. But unlike in Europe, where taxes and transfers greatly reduce inequality, in Brazil they are ""hardly redistributive"", says Mansueto Almeida, the treasury secretary. According to data compiled by the University of Pernambuco, in 2015 taxes and transfers reduced the average Gini coefficient in oecd countries from 0.47 to 0.31. In Brazil they cut inequality by only half as much.
The reason is that handouts are skewed towards the well-off. More than four-fifths of Brazilian transfers are pension benefits, compared with half in the European Union. Public pensions in Brazil are extremely regressive: just 2.5% of the cash goes to the poorest quintile, while the richest gets more than half. That group also benefits from tax loopholes not available to the poor. Servants of the state, who earn more than private-sector workers with similar qualifications, are especially cosseted. Last year a congressman billed taxpayers 157,000 reais for cosmetic dentistry. Some judges earn more in a month than those in rich countries make in a year.
Bolsa Família, by contrast, goes directly to the poor. Under Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, a left-wing president from 2003 to 2010, it grew into the world's largest conditional cash-transfer programme. The benefits are paid mostly to women via a chip card. More than 30m Brazilians escaped poverty between 2003 and 2014, thanks to Bolsa Família, other pro-poor policies and a commodity boom. In Belágua, most people now eat two meals a day instead of one. Houses are made of cinder-block, not banana leaves. ""You don't see kids working in the fields anymore,"" says Zé Raimundo Santos, the president of the agricultural co-operative.
Bolsa Família was especially important in rural towns like Belágua, where money had barely circulated, says Maria Ozanira da Silva e Silva of the Federal University of Maranhao. Women could buy food on credit in Belágua's first shops. Children spent more time in school and less time sick at home. Programmes such as Minha Casa, Minha Vida (My House, My Life) subsidised the construction of 4m houses, including Ms Ribeiro's. In the election in 2018 all but 295 voters in Belágua voted for the presidential candidate of Lula's Workers' Party.
But Belágua remains poor. Though its name means ""beautiful water"", the road from Sao Luís, Maranhāo's capital, is often too muddy in the rainy season and too sandy in the dry season for ordinary cars to pass. The local government is the only employer. Some households split one job paying the minimum wage of 1,039 reais a month four ways. Most families earn a pittance grinding cassava into tapioca flour. The work is gruelling. Mr Santos looks 70 but is 50.
When Brazil's worst-ever recession began in 2014, progress stopped and in some areas went into reverse. gdp per Brazilian dropped by 10% from 2014 to 2016. The number of unemployed nearly doubled to 14.2m, 13.7% of the workforce, from 2014 to 2017. Although the economy is recovering, 11% of the labour force remains unemployed. At the end of 2018 the number of people living on less than $1.25 a day reached 8.2m, the highest since 2007 (see chart).
Mr Bolsonaro is dismantling what Mr Guedes calls the ""machine of perverse income transfers"" by reforming pensions. Minimum retirement ages (of 65 for men and 62 for women) and other measures will save the government 855bn reais over ten years. Thanks to low inflation and a fall in interest rates the government will pay 100bn reais, 1.3% of gdp, less to creditors in 2020 than it did last year, says Mr Guedes. The economy grew by 0.6% between the second and third quarters of 2019, and the number of unemployed people fell below 12m for the first time since the second quarter of 2016. Mr Guedes takes this as proof that pro-growth austerity is working.
But the government has let police and army officers keep their lavish pensions. It has not touched tax breaks for privileged industries and the rich, worth 4% of gdp each year. Instead it has picked on Bolsa Família, which in 2020 will cost just 0.4% of gdp. Unlike most government spending (including salaries and the health and education budgets) it is not automatically adjusted for inflation. Since 2014, the average benefit has fallen in real terms.
In Belágua The Economist spoke to half a dozen families that have spent at least six months on the waiting list or have lost benefits. They include a family of nine; a 20-year-old mother and her underweight newborn; and three adolescents who dropped out of school because they could not afford uniforms.
In December the government suggested that it would increase Bolsa Família's budget by 16bn reais and rename the programme ""Renda Brasil"" (Brazil Income). But the economy ministry balked at the cost. Perhaps the government could spare 4bn reais, it said. Under a new budget rule, any increase in spending has to be matched by a cut somewhere else.
The Bolsa Família squeeze is the most important contributor to the recent increase in inequality, according to a study by economists at Fundaçao Getulio Vargas, a university in Sao Paulo. ""We pulled away the safety net when it was needed most,"" says Marcelo Neri, the study's lead author.
The government could save 9% of gdp by cutting wasteful spending further, eliminating tax breaks and narrowing the gap between public- and private-sector pay, says Arminio Fraga, a former central bank governor. It could spend that money to reduce the fiscal deficit, boost spending on infrastructure, health, education and Bolsa Família, and cut the tax burden. So there is ample room to make public spending both more progressive and more effective.
But Mr Bolsonaro seems unserious about some things that might help the poor. He dropped plans for a childhood literacy programme and recently named a sceptic of evolution to regulate universities. If the economic recovery doesn't reach poor Brazilians quickly, they could stage mass protests, as people have in other Latin American countries, warns Flávio Dino, the left-wing governor of Maranhao.
Maria marched only as far as the welfare office in Sao Luís, which told her in December that her monthly Bolsa Família benefit of 360 reais had been cancelled. A computer failed to register that she and her seven children had moved in June to a new town to escape her violent boyfriend. She has been waiting for months for the government to fix the mistake. ""Bolsa Família is the father of my children,"" she used to say. The joke does not make her smile now. -","Poverty in Brazil

Under the banner of ""religion and traditional (ecclesiastical) privileges"", in 1858 Mexican Conservatives rose in arms against a Liberal constitution which declared freedom of worship and ended a rule preventing Catholic church property from being transferred to anyone else. After a three-year war, the liberal principles of religious toleration and the separation of church and state triumphed. In the following decades they spread across Latin America. Now, it seems, this 19th-century political battle has to be fought all over again.
The new blurring of the divide between spiritual and temporal realms owes much to the rise of evangelical Protestantism. Although 69% of Latin Americans were still Catholics in 2014, 19% were Protestants (26% in Brazil and more than 40% in three Central American countries), says a Pew poll. The number of Protestants is likely to have risen since then. Most are Pentecostals.
They emphasise a literal reading of the Bible and a direct personal relationship with God through baptism with the Holy Spirit. Many want their beliefs to shape public policy. Their concern is mainly, but not solely, to oppose gay rights and abortion. In some cases they dismiss science and have intervened in foreign policy. Some question the separation of church and state.
Jair Bolsonaro, Brazil's populist president, says he is a Catholic but was rebaptised in the river Jordan by a Pentecostal pastor. ""The state is secular but we are Christian,"" he has said, suggesting to some that he is out to undermine the former. After an uprising overthrew Bolivia's socialist president, Evo Morales, in November, the caretaker conservative successor, Jeanine Áñez, declared that ""the Bible has come back to the palace."" The new cabinet took the oath of office on a large copy of the scriptures and before a cross. Luis Fernando Camacho, who led the uprising and is now a presidential candidate, wants to end the secular state enshrined in the constitution of 2009.
Capitol Ministries, an American evangelical outfit that aims to set up Biblestudies centres in the legislatures of nearly every country on Earth, has opened eight in Latin America. More are ""scheduled to launch"", according to its website.
The chief battleground for the new religious conservatism is personal behaviour. Mr Bolsonaro derides gay people. Damares Alves, a pastor who is his minister for women, family and human rights, promotes abstinence (rather than contraception) to prevent teenage pregnancy. Evangelicals opposed gay marriage even in communist Cuba. Their policy concerns go wider. Mr Bolsonaro has appointed a sceptic of evolution to head the agency that oversees the quality of higher education and a former evangelical missionary to run the body that deals with isolated indigenous tribes. Some pastors opposed the peace agreement of 2016 in Colombia between the government and the farc guerrillas. Capitol Ministries has lobbied Latin American governments to follow the United States in moving their embassies in Israel to Jerusalem. Guatemala has done so.
The Catholic church, too, is no stranger to politics. It used to promote Christian Democratic parties in Latin America. It, too, has fought against abortion and gay rights and to preserve religious education. Pope Francis, an Argentine, has made no secret of his sympathy for Peronism, the ruling populist movement. But evangelical politics tends to have more vigour and organisation. In Brazil, 195 of the 513 deputies in the lower house of Congress are members of the evangelical caucus. They include the Republican party, formed by the Universal Church of Edir Macedo, a wealthy megapastor. Evangelical pastors are more likely than Catholic bishops to tell their flock whom to vote for.
Not all evangelicals are conservative. In Brazil's election in 2018, Mr Bolsonaro got 22m evangelical votes but his leftwing opponent got 10m, estimates Datafolha, a pollster. Nor is religious conservatism carrying all before it. Brazil's Supreme Court last year ruled that homophobic acts are criminal. Alberto Fernández, Argentina's new president, has proposed a bill to legalise abortion.
Popular religiosity in Latin America has strong roots, as solace in an often unjust world. But secularism has served the region well. It has been free of religious strife since the 1920s. Latin America cries out for more, not less, science. Many of its citizens believe that their democracies owe them the right to live as they wish. The separation of religion and politics needs defending.","Blurring the separation between church and state

The government is based in the capital, which has been under siege by General Haftar's forces for a year. Turkey has intervened on the side of the government. Egypt, Russia and the United Arab Emirates back General Haftar. The EU said it would patrol the eastern Mediterranean, enforcing a long-ignored u n arms embargo on Libya.
Recep Tayyip Erdogan, Turkey's president, said it is ""only a matter of time"" before he launches an operation to stop the Syrian army's offensive on Idlib, the last rebel-held province in Syria. The regime of Bashar al-Assad, which is backed by Russia, has rejected Turkey's demands to pull back. Turkey, which has troops in the area and supports some of the rebels, fears a new influx of refugees. The UN says its aid operation is ""overwhelmed"".
Dozens of people were killed in Burkina Faso and Mali in ethnic or jihadist violence. They include 24 people gunned down in a church in northwestern Burkina Faso; jihadists were blamed for that attack. The deterioration in security comes after France promised to send another 600 troops to help stabilise the region.
Government forces in Cameroon were blamed for an attack that killed 22 civilians including 14 children in an English-speaking region. The government said the incident was an ""unfortunate accident"" during a firefight with rebels.
Terror on the streets
A gunman went on a shooting spree in the German city of Hanau, killing at least ten people and himself. The suspect was reported to have published racist videos and manifestos before the attack. Xenophobic terrorism in Germany appears to be growing; earlier this month police arrested 12 men suspected of planning attacks on mosques.
The British government set out plans to overhaul the immigration system. Workers from EU countries would be treated the same as non-EU workers if the plan becomes law. Fewer low-skilled migrants would be admitted, though the definition of ""skilled"" would expand.
A Dutch appeals court reinstated an inteRNAtional court's ruling that Russia owes $5obn to the shareholders of Yukos, an oil company it bankrupted and dismantled in 2003-07. The firm's seizure was a battle between President Vladimir Putin and Mikhail Khodorkovsky, the CEO of Yukos, who had political ambitions. Russia will appeal against the verdict to the Dutch supreme court.
A Turkish court acquitted a group of civic activists who took part in protests to save a park in Istanbul from development in 2013 of conspiring to overthrow the government. President Recep Tayyip Erdogan's repression of civil society worsened after the Gezi Park demonstrations. Prosecutors immediately re-arrested one of the activists on charges of taking part in an attempted coup in 2016.
No hiding place
Despite a fall in daily numbers of newly confirmed infections, many places in China maintained tight controls to curb the spread of covid-19. In Wuhan, where the new coronavirus was first discovered, officials banned outdoor activities. Beijing required anyone entering from another province to undergo 14 days of quarantine. In Japan, the quarantine of a cruise ship, the Diamond Princess, wound down, with hundreds of passengers allowed to leave. Over 600 others had been infected with the virus; two people died. Russia all but barred visits by Chinese citizens.
China announced the expulsion of three China-based correspondents of the Wall Street JouRNAl. It said this was in response to the newspaper's publication of an opinion piece under the headline ""China is the real sick man of Asia"". A day earlier, America designated five Chinese state-linked news organisations as ""foreign missions"".
Afghanistan's electoral commission announced the results of the presidential election, five months after the vote was held. It said the incumbent, Ashraf Ghani, had won with 50.6% of the vote, narrowly avoiding a run-off. His closest rival, Abdullah Abdullah, dismissed the results as fraudulent and declared himself the winner.
Time for a haircut
IMF officials held a round of talks with Argentina. The IMF said the country's debt position was now ""unsustainable"", meaning that private creditors must make a ""meaningful contribution"". The IMF expects Argentina to repay the money it lent the government in full.
In Canada a protest by indigenous groups and environmentalists against a proposed pipeline to transport gas to the Pacific coast shut one of the country's busiest rail routes, disrupting passenger and freight trains.

Mr Bolsonaro is a former army captain. He has remarked that the third floor of his presidential office ""is now completely militarised"".
All those military minds in the presidential palace are trained on the biggest threat to Brazil in the next 20 years: France. A leaked document from the defence ministry suggested that although China, Russia and even Venezuela could be considered bigger menaces, the top brass is worried that France might try to interfere in the Amazon, possibly launching an invasion from next door French Guiana.

MONTEVIDEO
In an interview, Uruguay's president-elect promises a tough hand on crime
AT HIS campaign headquarters on Artigas Boulevard, named after Uruguay's founding hero, the man who hopes to be its next one was energised. Luis Lacalle Pou, the country's conservative president-elect, is 46 years old but looks younger, with floppy brown hair, no jacket and sleeves rolled up. Days ahead of his swearing-in on March 1st, in an interview with The Economist, Mr Lacalle Pou set out a wide range of plans, from relaxing immigration rules to cutting public spending. But what obsessed him most of all was tackling a recent surge in crime (see chart on next page). He lamented that just down the road were ""no-go areas"" overrun with violence. ""It's time to take back the streets,"" he said, ""by force if need be.""
The first step was to take back power. Last November, in a run-off, Mr Lacalle Pou narrowly defeated Daniel Martínez, the candidate of the Broad Front, a leftist coalition that had ruled Uruguay for 15 years. (The last president from Mr Lacalle Pou's National Party was his father, in the 1990s.) The Broad Front had maintained economic and constitutional stability, and liberalised marijuana use and same-sex marriage. But it also presided over sharp rises in public employment, the fiscal deficit and violent crime. The homicide rate in Uruguay, a traditionally safe country of about 3.5m, shot up by 46% in 2018, to 11.8 per 100,000 people, lower than Brazil's but higher than Argentina's. Mr Lacalle Pou's coalition blames lax policing and light sentencing.
""Not even priests feel safe here,"" says Mercedes Rossi, a housewife in the working-class quarter of Casavalle, 20 minutes from downtown Montevideo, the capital. ""The delinquents rule this neighbourhood with guns and knives."" Such fears helped Mr Lacalle Pou win.
So it is unsurprising that he sounds so gung-ho about security. His appointment of Jorge Larrañaga, an experienced politician and longtime rival within his own party, as interior minister, was further confirmation. The incoming minister has promised a ""very tough hand"", and his record suggests as much. Last year Mr Larrañaga pushed a ""Live Without Fear"" plebiscite, which proposed harsh measures: deploying soldiers to fight crime, encouraging night raids by police and imposing draconian prison sentences. That initiative failed, by 47% to 53%.
But its proposals may be revived, with minor alterations. Mr Lacalle Pou said his government intends to deploy paramilitary units from the existing Republican Guard and a new National Guard, as well as double some sentences for serious crimes. This is part of an emergency package to address public safety but also housing, education and the budget. With coalition partners, the new president can probably push it through. ""This will not be brutal,"" Mr Lacalle Pou insisted; ""it will be decisive in giving people security again."" The opposition disagrees. Carolina Cosse, a politician in the Broad Front, decries the tough-on-crime measures as ""an authoritarian attack on democracy"". Her colleagues are supporting planned strikes to coincide with congressional debate on the legislation.
The man who would bin bureaucrats
The incoming government has economic woes, too. It will inherit a budget deficit of about 4.7% of GDP and anaemic growth. This is in part because Uruguay tends to suffer economically when next-door Argentina and Brazil do. As a candidate, Mr Lacalle Pou, who is pro-business and proausterity, favoured fiscal discipline. He committed to reducing public spending by $1bn. Cuts will come, he has promised, from government jobs and infrastructure, not services in what is often regarded as Latin America's oldest welfare state. None- theless the axe will hurt. Adolfo Garcé, a political analyst, predicts that hitting the target will require slashing public-sector jobs by a third.
Foreign investment and talent could provide a boost. ""We are one of the best countries in the world to live in,"" said Mr Lacalle Pou. To tempt foreigners, he plans to make it easier for them to seek residency in Uruguay, where they already enjoy low taxes and exemptions on some types of foreign income, such as pensions. The target audience is Argentina. Immigration lawyers report that many Argentines seek to live across the River Plate as a result of their country's economic crisis.
Next month's inauguration offers an opportunity to reintroduce Uruguay to the world. In some ways the ceremony will reflect the country's perennial position, predetermined by geography, as a sober intermediary between its bigger, more powerful and less temperate neighbours. Jair Bolsonaro, Brazil's populist president, and Alberto Fernández, his centre-left counterpart in Argentina, were expected to meet at the ceremony after a public spat. Now it seems that Mr Fernández has cancelled. Mr Lacalle Pou promises to work with both men to reinvigorate the Mercosur trade bloc, comprised of their three countries plus Paraguay. But the guest-list also marks a noticeable shift: the authoritarian leftist leaders of Venezuela, Cuba and Nicaragua are personae non gratae.
The next president faces high expectations and only a short period, maybe a year or 18 months, in which to meet them, predicts Mr Garcé. Voters were split in the last election. And the opposition, especially the trade-union movement, remains strong. Reforms must strike a balance between reassurance and disruption. Mr Lacalle Pou seeks a middle way, in line with the people who elected him. ""I voted for change, and I'm optimistic our president will be a vehicle for change,"" says Ernesto Cis, a driver and tour guide. ""We Uruguayans don't do revolutions. We like change with continuidad.""","Uruguay 's next president

The president of France, Emmanuel Macron, declared that the country is ""at war"" with the coronavirus. He announced the suspension of local elections, a day after France had voted in the first round.
The Constitutional Court in Russia approved amendments to the country's constitution that will reset to zero the number of terms already served by Vladimir Putin. He would otherwise have been ineligible to run again when his current term expires in 2024.

He was convicted for obtaining the materials for the bomb and of helping in the plot. In addition to those murdered a further 800 were hurt, more than 90 with lifechanging injuries.
Another chance for Gantz
Benny Gantz, the leader of the opposition in Israel, was given the first shot at forming a government after a tight election earlier this month. But his coalition is divided. Binyamin Netanyahu, the prime minister, has tried to push Mr Gantz into forming a unity government, under Mr Netanyahu, to deal with covid-19.
The president or Iraq named Adnan al-Zurfi as prime minister-designate in a bid to end a months-long political deadlock. The previous prime minister resigned in November amid large anti-government protests. Powerful Shia parties have already lined up against Mr Zurfi's nomination.
Sweden promised to send 150 commandos and helicopters to Mali to join a French-led mission fighting jihadists in the Sahel. Security in the country has continued to deteriorate.
Peter Mutharika, president of Malawi, sacked the head of the army, dissolved his cabinet and refused to sign new laws allowing for fresh elections in May. Malawi's top court had annulled his re-election victory, citing vote-rigging. He plans to stick around anyway.
Risky behaviour
Brazil's president, Jair Bolsonaro, joined supporters who were holding demonstrations in favour of him. He fistbumped his fans and took selfies with them even though at least 17 people who accompanied him on a recent visit to Mar-a-Lago, Donald Trump's getaway in Florida, tested positive for covid-19. Mr Bolsonaro describes the reaction to the virus as ""hysteria"".
A court in Guyana temporarily blocked a recount of votes cast in the general election on March 2nd. A candidate from the president's coalition brought the suit seeking the injunction. International observers had said there was credible evidence of fraud in an initial tally, which gave victory to the president.
Repressing the press
China ordered American citizens working for the New York Times, the Wall Street Journal and the Washington Post to leave the country. It was the biggest mass expulsion of western correspondents from China since the Communist takeover in 1949. The government said it was a response to America's decision to limit the number of people working for China's main state-owned news organisations stationed in America to 100.
Amid cries of ""shame"", opposition mps staged a walkout from the Rajya Sabha, India's upper house, when Ranjan Gogoi took oath as a new member. Mr Gogoi recently retired as chief justice; critics of the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party claim his seat is a pay-off for rulings that favoured the government.
East Timor entered its third week of political flux after the prime minister resigned. The president is mulling whether to call a snap election or appoint as prime minister Xanana Gusmăo, a former president who says he has the support of a majority of mps.
America urged the government of Afghanistan and the Taliban to proceed with a proposed exchange of prisoners, as promised in the agreement the Taliban signed with America in February. The Afghan government wants the exchange to proceed alongside peace talks, but the Taliban say talks cannot begin until the prisoners are released.

Covid-19 threatens to devastate poor countries
The new coronavirus is causing havoc in rich countries. Often overlooked is the damage it will cause in poor ones, which could be even worse. Official data do not begin to tell the story. As of March 25th Africa had reported only 2,800 infections so far; India, only 650. But the virus is in nearly every country and will surely spread. There is no vaccine. There is no cure. A very rough guess is that, without a campaign of social distancing, between 25% and 80% of a typical population will be infected. Of these, perhaps 4.4% will be seriously sick and a third of those will need intensive care. For poor places, this implies calamity.
Social distancing is practically impossible if you live in a crowded slum. Hand-washing is hard if you have no running water (see Middle East & Africa section). Governments may tell people not to go out to work, but if that means their families will not eat, they will go out anyway. If prevented, they may riot.
So covid-19 could soon be all over poor countries. And their health-care systems are in no position to cope. Many cannot deal with the infectious diseases they already know, let alone a new and highly contagious one. Health spending per head in Pakistan is one two-hundredth the level in America. Uganda has more government ministers than intensive-care beds. Throughout history, the poor have been hardest-hit by pandemics. Most people who die of aids are African. The Spanish flu wiped out 6% of India's entire population.
Dozens of developing countries have ordered lockdowns. India has announced a ""total ban"" on leaving home for 21 days (see Asia section). South Africa has deployed the army to help enforce one. They may slow the disease, but they are unlikely to stop it.
Many places are still in denial. Street markets in Myanmar are packed. Brazil's populist president, Jair Bolsonaro, dismisses covid-19 as just ""a sniffle"" (see Americas section). Some leaders are clueless. Tanzania's president, John Magufuli, said churches should stay open because the coronavirus is ""satanic"" and ""cannot survive in the body of Christ"". Many autocrats see covid-19 as a handy excuse to tighten their grip. Expect some to ban political rallies, postpone elections and extend surveillance over citizens' daily lives-all to protect public health, of course.
Granted, there are some reasons for hope. Poor countries are young-the median age in Africa is under 20-and the young appear less likely to die from an infection. The poorest are very rural: two-thirds of people in countries with incomes per head below $1,000 a year live in the countryside, compared with less than a fifth in rich countries. Farmers can grow yams without breathing viral droplets on each other. The climate may help. It is possible, though far from certain, that hot weather slows the spread of covid-19. Some places have useful experience. Countries that endured Ebola learned a lot about hand-washing, contact-tracing and securing public trust.
Alas, even the good news comes with caveats. People in poor countries may be young, but they often have weak lungs or immune systems, because of malnutrition, tuberculosis or hiv. Rural folk may get the virus later, but they will probably still get it. Lockdowns will be hard to sustain unless governments can provide a generous safety-net. Firms need credit to avoid laying off staff. Informal workers need cash to tide them over. Unfortunately, poor countries do not have the financial muscle to provide these things, and covid-19 has just made it much harder.
Demand has collapsed for the commodities on which many emerging markets depend, from crude oil to fresh flowers. Tourism has tanked. No one wants to visit the Masai Mara or Machu Picchu just now. Foreign investors have pulled $83bn from emerging markets since the start of the crisis, the largest capital outflow ever recorded, says the Institute of International Finance, a trade group. Remittances, usually a safety-net in hard times, may tumble as migrants in rich countries lose their jobs.
Many poor and middle-income countries face a balance-ofpayments crisis and a collapse in government revenues as they need to raise health-related spending and imports (to reduce the death toll) and welfare (so that workers can isolate themselves without running out of money). Whereas governments in rich countries can borrow cheaply in a crisis as investors flock to safety, poor countries see their borrowing costs soar. The tradeoff between saving lives and saving livelihoods is excruciating. The worry, as Imran Khan, Pakistan's prime minister says, is that ""if we shut down the cities...we will save [people] from corona at one end, but they will die from hunger.""
Far from helping, many better-off countries have taken a nationalist turn. Some places, such as the eu, are restricting the export of medical kit. That goes against the values they profess to hold. Other countries, such as Kazakhstan, are curbing exports of food, which is not in short supply. If global trade is gummed up, the economic damage will be far greater. For poor countries that rely on imported food, it could be deadly.
Since so much remains unknown about covid-19, any response must be based on imperfect information. But some things are both urgent and obvious. Governments in poor countries, as elsewhere, should supply people with timely, accurate information, by any means practical. No cover-ups, no internet shut-downs, no arresting of those who share unwelcome news.
Time to be generous
The rich world, meanwhile, should help the poor world swiftly and copiously. The imf says it is ready to deploy its $1trn lending capacity. Much more may be needed. As The Economist went to press, the G20 was about to set out a plan. It should be generous. Some of those vast rich-world bail-out pots should be used to cushion the suffering of the global south. China is winning influence with high-profile deliveries of medical equipment. Poor countries will remember who helped them.
As past campaigns against malaria and hiv showed, it takes a co-ordinated global effort to roll back a global scourge. It is too late to avoid a large number of deaths, but not too late to avert catastrophe. And it is in rich countries' interests to think globally as well as locally. If covid-19 is left to ravage the emerging world, it will soon spread back to the rich one. -","The pandemic

Brazil's president fiddles as a pandemic looms
The first person to die from covid-19 in the state of Rio de Janeiro was a 63-yearold maid who commuted each week to a beachside apartment in Leblon, the priciest neighbourhood in Brazil. Her employer had recently returned from Italy. The maid, who had diabetes and high blood pressure, died on March 17th in a city 100km (60 miles) away, where she and five relatives shared a cinder-block house. Several hospital workers there have since fallen ill.
If the virus in Italy jumps between generations living together, in Brazil it started by hopping between classes, which are socially distant but physically close. One vector may be the populist president, Jair Bolsonaro. On March 15th, after his communications secretary tested positive for the virus, he ignored quarantine orders and took selfies with fans. When the first Brazilian died of covid-19 on the next day, he denounced ""hysteria"" about the virus.
Other leaders are less complacent. Voting remotely for the first time, congressmen proclaimed a ""state of calamity"", which lets the government breach constitutional spending limits. Rodrigo Maia, the president of the lower house, wants to spend at least 400bn reais ($8obn, or 4% of gdp) to help the health system and the economy. The health minister, Luiz Henrique Mandetta, is not an ideologue, unlike many of his cabinet colleagues. City and state governments are imposing isolation measures-Sāo Paulo and Rio de Janeiro have full lockdowns-and turning football stadiums into hospitals. Universities and private labs are developing covid-19 tests. Companies are donating materials for their production. Brazil's biggest brewery is making hand sanitiser.
But workers against the disease must block out signals from a president who continues to disparage their efforts. On March 25th he told Mr Mandetta to stop calling for large-scale social distancing. In a televised speech on March 24th, he urged local governments to abandon ""scorchedearth"" strategies of closing schools and shops, and blasted the media for spreading ""the sensation of fear"".
As The Economist went to press, Brazil had 59 covid-19 deaths and 2,554 confirmed cases. But testing has mostly been limited to patients in hospital. The true number is probably much higher. Piecemeal responses by governments and the private sector will not fend off disaster. Warm climates like Brazil's may slow transmission of the virus, says a new study from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Otherwise ""there are no mitigating factors,"" says Paulo Chapchap of the Sirio-Libanes hospital in Sāo Paulo. Private hospitals like his are strained, because current patients tend to be rich folk who caught the disease abroad, or their intimates. As it migrates to the masses it could quickly overwhelm the public health system, which serves fourfifths of the population.
Brazil's universal health-care system serves more people than any other totally free system in the world, but the country spends just 3.8% of gdp on it. Italy spends 6.7% of gdp; Germany, 9.4%. Brazil's public system has just seven acute-care hospital beds per 100,000 people, nearly all of which are occupied by non-covid patients. Demand for acute-care beds in some cities 1 · abroad has approached 25 per 100,000 during the pandemic. Mr Mandetta warns that the system could ""collapse"" in April.
The Institute for Health Policy Studies in Rio calculates that the government would need to spend ibn reais for every 1% of the population infected in order to treat all severe cases. The government has approved around i0bn reais of extra spending, a rise of a tenth but probably too little. ""The forecast is catastrophic,"" says Miguel Lago, the institute's director.
Until the government reaches its goal of testing 30,000-50,000 people a day, which may take months, lockdowns are the only way to slow transmission. This is especially hard in favelas. These informal settlements are home to 13m of Brazil's 211m people, including a fifth of those in Rio. They are densely packed and many lack running water. For now, grassroots groups, not the government, are running public-health campaigns. Organisers in the Maré, in Rio, suggest quarantining patients with mild symptoms in empty schools. Paraisópolis, in Sāo Paulo, plans to move older residents to rented mansions in a leafy district nearby. Activists are driving around favelas with loudspeakers, telling residents to stay home. In some, drug-traffickers have shut open-air drug markets, cancelled bailes funk (all-night parties) and imposed curfews. ""If the government isn't capable of making it happen, organised crime will,"" vows one gang on WhatsApp.
In many favelas commerce continues because people have to work. Just a fifth of residents have formal jobs. Most are daylabourers, vendors or domestic employees. They can afford to stay home only if the government pays them, says Eliana Sousa Silva of Redes da Maré, an ngo.
The government plans to give informal workers 300 reais a month for three months. That may not be enough. Brazil's fiscal deficit and weak credit rating will prevent the government from offering a massive stimulus (see Bello). Paulo Guedes, the economy minister, has proposed almost no new economic support.
As suffering spreads, the political cost to Mr Bolsonaro will become clearer. Twenty-three people who travelled with him to see Donald Trump in Florida this month have tested positive for covid-19. On March 13th Fox News reported that the president's son, Eduardo, said that his father had the virus. Both then denied it. A judge ordered the military hospital in Brasilia, the capital, to publish the names of confirmed cases from the delegation. It held back two.
People in swanky neighbourhoods that voted for Mr Bolsonaro in 2018 are now banging pots and pans in nightly protests. In one poll, his approval rating dropped to its lowest point since he took office last year. Fiddling while a pandemic looms may cost him re-election in 2022. -","Covid-19 in Brazil

SINCE HE TOOK over as Peru's president two years ago Martín Vizcarra, an otherwise nondescript politician, has not flinched from taking bold decisions. He pushed political reforms through by referendum. Faced with a serially obstructive Congress, last year he shut it down, calling a fresh legislative election. Characteristically, he was the first Latin American leader to react to covid-19 by imposing a lockdown and curfew, on March 15th when his country had only 71 reported cases. Peruvians appreciate this restriction on their liberties for the public good. In an Ipsos poll his approval rating soared from 52% to 87%.
That is the pattern in Latin America. In Argentina Alberto Fernández, who took over a politically divided country in December, has seen his popularity rise to over 80% after he imposed a quarantine and sealed borders. In Colombia the new mayor of Bogotá, Claudia López, stole a march over a hesitant national government when she imposed a four-day trial lockdown. Chile's Sebastián Piñera, whose presidency seemed moribund after protests, has deployed testing and sealed off hotspots. His popularity has crept up, from 10% in December to 21%.
Their approach contrasts with that of the populist presidents of Brazil, Jair Bolsonaro, and Mexico, Andrés Manuel López Obrador, often called amlo. Both have given priority to protecting weak economies. Both spent weeks denying the seriousness of the virus and refusing to respect social-distancing measures recommended by their health ministries.
In Mexico, according to Alberto DíazCayeros, a political scientist at Stanford University, the government's caution was rooted in trust in the capacity of the health service to deal with the threat. That approach worked against swine flu in 2009. It underestimated covid-19, which spreads aggressively, with many symptomless cases. On March 24th the government pivoted, shutting schools and banning non-essential activity. Six days later, with the virus out of control, it declared a state of emergency.
AMLO has muddled the message about social distancing. Mr Bolsonaro went further, actively sabotaging efforts to control the virus. In Brazil state governors have imposed lockdowns, including in Sāo Paulo and Rio de Janeiro. These measures are popular. Mr Bolsonaro's heedlessness is less so. City residents staged pot-banging protests against the president. That prompted a counter-attack. Mr Bolsonaro railed against the governors, issued a video proclaiming ""Brazil cannot stop"", and urged supporters to stage cavalcades against quarantines. Only on March 31st, with 201deaths in Brazil, did he (briefly) recognise the seriousness of the virus, calling for a ""pact"" against it ""to save lives without leaving jobs behind"". He then reverted to his earlier rhetoric.
What political consequences will these actions have? Though he is still popular, amlo's approval rating was declining before the virus, because of his failure to halt crime or to revive the economy. That trend seems set to continue. As for Mr Bolsonaro, some think his actions merit impeachment, for threatening the constitutional right to life. His strategy appears aimed at shoring up his base. Polls show he retains the support of a third of respondents. That should be enough to keep his job, depending on how many Brazilians die.
Those who have acted decisively are benefiting from the public's instinct to rally round their leaders at a time of danger. But sustaining the quarantines in a region where many live precariously will be hard. Take Argentina, where Mr Fernández already faced a stricken economy. His government has made some emergency handouts of money and food in poor areas on the periphery of Buenos Aires, where his Peronist political movement has long run things. Even so, the Peronists ""are very worried, they fear a social explosion and losing control"", says Sergio Berensztein, a political consultant. He thinks the government may have to make quarantine more selective and flexible, at the risk of prolonging the epidemic. Much the same goes for Peru.
Covid-19 struck Latin America when its leaders and institutions had fallen into disrepute, because of economic stagnation, corruption and poor public services. Management of the pandemic requires a huge effort to help those in need. It may also offer an opportunity for redemption. Leaders who impose quarantines could save the lives of 2.5m Latin Americans, according to epidemiologists at Imperial College, London. They have to find ways to make citizens remember that, even as economic hardship bites.","A reward , for now , for leaders who have acted decisively to fight the pandemic

One by one the doubters have made their peace with medical science. Only four rulers in the world continue to deny the threat to public health posed by covid-19. Two are flotsam from the former Soviet Union, the despots of Belarus and Turkmenistan. A third is Daniel Ortega, the tropical dictator of Nicaragua. The other is the elected president of a great, if battered, democracy. Jair Bolsonaro's undermining of his own government's efforts to contain the virus may mark the beginning of the end of his presidency.
Since the new coronavirus was first detected in Brazil in late February Mr Bolsonaro, a former army captain with a fondness for military rulers, has made light of it. Dismissing its effects as ""just a little dose of flu"", he said ""we're going to face the virus like a man, dammit, not like a little boy."" He added, helpfully: ""we're all going to die one day."" In the 15 months since he became president, Brazilians have become accustomed to his macho bravado and ignorance on issues ranging from the conservation of the Amazon rainforest to education and policing. But this time the damage is immediate and obvious: Mr Bolsonaro has coupled defiant rhetoric with active sabotage of public health.
He claims to believe in ""vertical isolation"", in the quarantining only of Brazilians aged over 60 in order to limit damage to the economy. There are two problems with this. Young people die of covid-19 (10% of those it has killed in Brazil are under 60), and enforcement of such a quarantine would be impossible.
The governors of Brazil's most important states have gone ahead and imposed lockdowns using their own powers. Mr Bolsonaro has encouraged Brazilians to ignore them. A man who fears betrayal and has a perpetual need to provoke, he greeted with hugs and selfies supporters who attended a rally against Congress on March 15 th. He launched a campaign urging businesses to re-open and called for a religious ""fast and demonstration"" to take place in churches on April 5th. He has mused about decreeing, illegally, an end to the lockdowns. He has twice come close to sacking his own health minister, Luiz Henrique Mandetta, a conservative doctor who publicly opposed the president's call to loosen restrictions. Mr Bolsonaro is seemingly jealous of the rising profile of a minister he claims ""lacks humility"".
Even by his own standards, Mr Bolsonaro's breach of his primary duty to protect lives has gone too far. Much of the government is treating him like a difficult relative who shows signs of insanity. Key ministers, including the cohort of generals in the cabinet, as well as the speakers of both houses of Congress, have given sometimes ostentatious support to Mr Mandetta, who has the public on his side. A poll this month by Datafolha found 76% approval for the health ministry's handling of the virus, compared with 33% for Mr Bolsonaro's management of the crisis.
Calls for Mr Bolsonaro's resignation have mounted. They have come not just from the left but also from some of his erstwhile supporters such as Janaina Paschoal, a Sāo Paulo state legislator whom he once considered as his running mate. Saying he was guilty of ""a crime against public health"", she added: ""we don't have time for impeachment.""
There can be little doubt that the president's conduct constitutionally merits impeachment, a fate that befell two of his predecessors, Fernando Collor in 1992 and Dilma Rousseff in 2016. But for now Mr Bolsonaro retains sufficient public support to survive. While polls found a majority favouring Ms Rousseff's ousting (for breaking the fiscal-responsibility law to win re-election), 59% told Datafolha they don't want Mr Bolsonaro to resign. Her approval rating fell to around 10%; he retains the support of a third of voters. Few in Brasilia believe that the country wants or can afford the distraction of impeachment while it is under siege from covid-19.
Mr Bolsonaro is sustained by a small coterie of ideological zealots who include his three sons, by the faith of many evangelical Protestants and by lack of information about covid-19 among some Brazilians. The last two factors may change as the virus ploughs its fatal furrow in the coming months. By April 8th Brazil had suffered 14,049 confirmed cases and 688 dead. And the president may not be able to quarantine himself from blame for the economic impact. By his recklessness with the lives of Brazilians, Mr Bolsonaro has forced the possibility of his own departure onto the political agenda. It is likely to remain there after the epidemic fades.","Jair Bolsonaro's reckless handling of covid -19 will come back to haunt Jair Bolsonaro

CAIRO AND ROME
The pandemic has exposed and deepened fissures within religions
In the 2,000 years since the story of Jesus was first told in Rome, his followers have never seen an Easter like this. In Catholicism's home, the most poignant moment in the Paschal drama comes on Good Friday when the pope leads worshippers on a walk, with 14 stops, enacting the progress of Jesus towards his execution.
This year that has proved impossible. It was announced that instead, Pope Francis would move about in an empty St Peter's square. Two days later, on April 12th, instead of proclaiming the resurrection of Jesus to a multitude, he would officiate almost alone in its vast basilica. Millions could observe, but only electronically.
Past emergencies, from recessions to wars, have galvanised people to find new meaning in old rituals. But nothing prepared believers for the world of covid-19, in which those rituals, the gestures and gatherings at the heart of their identity, have become a public danger. For innovative religious types who already use technology with confidence (see box), the crisis will accelerate a trend. But for more established faiths, reactions have ranged from meek compliance to truculent defiance.
Covid-19 has not generally widened fissures between faiths. Rather, it has widened those within the ranks of all great religions. They were already squabbling over how far old beliefs could live with modern views of Earth's origin. The pandemic exacerbates the rift between science-defiers and those who respect the laboratory.
For some, the bafflement is palpable. Russian Orthodoxy's Patriarch Kirill declared on March 29th: ""I have been preaching for 51 years...I hope you understand how difficult it is for me to say today, refrain from visiting churches."" Among eastern Christianity's followers, many will not: clerics in Georgia, for example, continued to offer the faithful consecrated bread and wine, by which it is impossible, they insist, to be harmed.
Pope Francis has sounded surer: ""Thick darkness has gathered over our squares, our streets and our cities; it has taken over our lives, filling everything with a deafening silence and a distressing void."" But the broader response of Western faith has been unimpressive, argues Marco Ventura of Siena University. ""Even for many believers, medical officers are the new prophets.""
Not all Christians agree. Some American evangelicals, including vocal supporters of Donald Trump, have been reckless denialists of covid-19. A preacher in Florida, Rodney Howard-Browne, was briefly arrested on March 30th after busing people to worship, insisting he could neutralise the virus. Some politicians seem half-sympathetic. Two days later the state's governor, Ron DeSantis, listed religious activities among ""essential services"" that could continue (without crowds) despite a lockdown. In at least a dozen other states, such activities were left unimpeded.
Secularist rage has been rising since early surges in the epidemic were traced to religious recklessness. In South Korea hundreds of members of the secretive Shincheonji Church of Jesus contracted the virus at packed services and spread it. The government complained that the church was not co-operating in tracing them. Its leader later apologised. An Islamic gathering in Malaysia in February helped spread the virus to neighbouring countries.
Elsewhere, liberal clergymen, rabbis and imams have heeded calls to suspend gatherings. But among ordinary people, the order to stop their cherished rituals feels like a dark conspiracy. ""Not even the communists completely forbade Easter services"" is a refrain in eastern Europe.
Within Judaism, many have reacted creatively, accepting, for instance, that a minyan, the ten-strong quorum for worship, might assemble electronically. The ultraOrthodox, or Haredim, however, have dug their heels in. In Israel the Haredi stronghold of Bnei Brak has been a covid-19 hotspot. People have insisted on gathering for prayers, weddings and funerals, defying a lockdown and exacerbating chronic tensions between the Haredim and the state.
Elsewhere zealots already at odds with the state or with established religious powers have found in the virus a fresh battleground. In Iraq Muqtada al-Sadr, a fiery cleric, has challenged Grand Ayatollah Ali al-Sistani, a Shia leader who has denounced those who spread the virus as murderers. On March 5th Mr Sadr prayed at the entrance to the Imam Ali shrine in Najaf until caretakers opened the teak doors. It remained open, and mourners carry their dead around the shrine in coffins. The radical preacher has called coronavirus a punishment for gay marriage, as have some fundamentalist Christians.
Where the state broadly controls Islam, as it does in the Gulf monarchies, orders to suspend Friday prayers have been obeyed. The Saudis have told pilgrims to defer any plans to make the haj in July. But when Ramadan begins around April 23rd, authorities in all Islamic lands will struggle to restrain communal meals to break the fast.
In Iran, one of the first- and worst-hit countries, the religious authorities wield ultimate power. Their decision on March 16th to suspend pilgrimages to holy places, including those in the city of Qom from which infection had spread to other countries, was criticised as too late by secular liberals, too harsh by the ultra-devout.
India is one of many places where politicians must collaborate with religious forces. In Ayodhya, claimed as the birthplace of Rama, officials tried with mixed results to limit celebrations of the Hindu god. It was left up to the Hindu organisers to encourage restraint; they obeyed reluctantly.
On the spectrum of reactions, the Catholic one stands out as respectful of science. Today's Holy See differs from the one which in centuries past persecuted astronomers. But some critics, including conservative American Catholics, see in its meek response the church's broader weakness.
The contrast between cautious Catholics and gung-ho evangelicals has been sharp in Brazil. Catholic bishops and politicians have co-operated with the suspension of services, while President Jair Bolsonaro, an evangelical who has called the virus ""just a sniffle"", has joined co-religionists in legal battles to keep churches open.
In the end, the survival of religions may depend on their finding a way of explaining to followers, in their own terms, why their spiritual duty now lies in suspending rites hitherto regarded as vital. As Shadi Hamid of the Brookings Institution, a think-tank, notes, Muslim jurisprudence has accepted that human survival can trump other norms: a Muslim can eat forbidden pork rather than starve. For liberalminded Jews, the ideal of tikkun olam, or repairing the world, is higher than rules governing prayer or diet.
Communion, during which Christians consume bread and wine which some believe to have been transformed into the body and blood of Jesus, throws up particular challenges. Rule-minded Christians find an electronic Eucharist untenable: the ritual has to be physical.
And yet traditional Christian teaching may also have hygienically helpful things to say. It affirms that the entire world is mysteriously blessed every time bread and wine are sanctified, regardless of how many are present. That helps explain the determination of Greece's bishops to celebrate ""behind closed doors"" this month the services leading to Orthodox Easter.
James Alison, a radical Catholic priest, proposes a solution both revolutionary and traditionalist. He is encouraging households to practise ""Eucharistic worship"" at home: to bless bread and wine and invoke the presence of Jesus. His approach, he says, affirms the intimacy and mystery of classical worship but challenges the idea of a caste of celebrants. As he points out, a lack of manpower in some parts of Christendom is already prompting a rethink of the role of priests: the virus could be the coup de grâce. Pope Francis has called the pandemic ""a time to separate that which is necessary from that which is not"". Some may take him at his word.","Religious divides

NEW YORK AND JOHANNESBURG
In the absence of American leadership, China sees a chance to boost its clout
China calls it the biggest emergencyaid operation that it has mounted abroad since 1949, when the Communist Party seized power. Hardly a day goes by without news of Chinese medical supplies, from masks to ventilators, reaching grateful recipients; and of Chinese medical teams flying to foreign countries to help them fight covid-19. Just a few weeks ago China was by far the biggest victim of the new coronavirus, and its government was widely chided for covering up the initial outbreak. Now China is trying to paint a new picture-of itself as a model for taming the disease, and as the world's saviour.
State media are on hand to trumpet each donation, no matter how small. On March 21st a freight train set off from the eastern Chinese city of Yiwu bound for Madrid, more than 13,000km away. In addition to its cargo of commercial goods were 110,000 masks and nearly 800 protective suits donated by a state-owned firm (they arrived more than two weeks later). The aid was worth less than $50,000. But a state-media website called it a ""new turning-point"" in the building of a ""health silk road"". Among slogans reportedly affixed to the train was one saying: ""Come on, matadors!""
It is hardly surprising that China is turning its attention to the plight of other countries. Its covid-related data are of dubious quality, but it has clearly achieved a dramatic reduction in infections at home. Almost all of its newly reported cases involve travellers from abroad. As the world's biggest producer of much of the medical kit that is most urgently needed globally, and with its own demand for it much reduced, China is well placed to assist. Indeed, in a pandemic, ""to help others is also to help oneself"", as a Chinese spokeswoman put it.
China, however, also sees potential political rewards. A big one is enhancing its power abroad. Even before the pandemic China had been jostling with America for global influence. Now it sees America crippled by the coronavirus, and the country's president, Donald Trump, fumbling in his response to the crisis and unwilling to organise an international effort to fight the disease. At a five-yearly party congress in 2017, President Xi Jinping said his country would become a global leader by mid-century in terms of ""international influence"". That goal is evident in China's descriptions of how the world should evolve in response to covid. In effect, it should have China even more at the centre.
Another political gain that the party may hope to reap is at home. Playing up China's help for stricken countries, and their desire to learn from China's success, helps to deflect public criticism of the party's early response to the disease-its gagging of doctors who shared information about it online and its failure to warn citizens despite evidence of human-to-human transmission. State media insist that China's battle against covid-19 has shown the ""superiority"" of Chinese-style socialism, with its ""unique"" ability to marshal people and resources. Burnishing Mr Xi's image as a figure of global stature helps to reinforce this message. Any phone call between Mr Xi and a world leader to discuss the crisis makes the headlines of state television's · nightly news, no matter how banal the publicly released content. Mr Xi is the dependable, magnanimous statesman. No prizes for viewers who can guess who, by implication, is not such a politician.
The party's propaganda about the aid effort is suffused with Mr Xi's catchphrases. Take the health silk road that the train to Spain symbolically followed. The metaphor was first used by Mr Xi in 2017, when China signed an agreement with the World Health Organisation (who) to establish a health-related subset of the Belt and Road Initiative, China's global infrastructurebuilding project (to which the who was the first un body to sign up). The belt-and-road idea, and all associated silk-road-branded schemes, are closely linked with Mr Xi. Their content is vague-no clear definition has been offered, for example, of a health silk road. But the intent is clear: to portray China as fundamentally benign. The roads span the globe, but all lead back to China.
In his discussions with world leaders about covid-related aid, Mr Xi likes to use another of his favourite expressions: building a ""community with a shared future for mankind"". It sounds harmless enough, but central to this idea is a principle that China holds dear, namely that of respecting other countries regardless of their political systems. Various formulations of this have been used since the days of Mao Zedong (Mao's favoured term, the ""five principles of peaceful coexistence"", remains in use). It means that other countries should swallow any misgivings about the way China is ruled and show it respect.
On March 26th, at an online meeting of do leaders, Mr Xi prefaced his offer to share China's experience of fighting the disease and co-operate in the search for a vaccine by emphasising China's commitment to ""the notion of a community with a shared future for mankind"". The ""urgency and importance"" of creating such a community had become ""even more evident"" during the pandemic, he told the president of Kazakhstan, Kassym-Jomart Tokayev, two days earlier.
Some commentators in China say the country's medical aid could help to strengthen China's attractive ""soft power"", as opposed to the hard kind involving military and economic might. Building such power has been one of the party's goals since a party congress in 2007. Mr Xi has devoted particular attention to it, beefing up projects such as Confucius Institutes and global broadcasting ventures that aim to convey sanitised news about China to Western audiences, delivered in a disarmingly Western style. During the pandemic, China's state media as well as the country's diplomats have been using Twitter and Facebook (which are blocked in China itself) to promote China's charitable efforts. Experts say that thousands of the Twitter accounts used for this are ""sock-puppet"" ones set up to spread disinformation.
The propaganda campaign has been helped by America's virtual absence from the world stage during the pandemic-in part because of Mr Trump's lack of interest in global leadership, and in part because of the damage caused by covid-19 at home. America has even found itself in the embarrassing position of clawing back aid it was meant to give. In March its Agency for International Development (usaid), which played a crucial role in helping African countries contain Ebola in 2014-16, began cancelling shipments of medical supplies abroad because they were needed in America. And as the Trump administration and American governors and hospitals scour the world for masks, gowns and the like, they are infuriating allies who need the same things. Early this month officials in France and Germany accused America of diverting shipments of medical masks that had been intended for use in their countries. Officials in Washington have denied the reports, but they reinforce the view, held in much of the world, that America is looking out only for itself. Mr Trump's decision on April 14th to suspend his country's payments to the who because of its handling of the pandemic will strengthen this belief, even though many Western officials sympathise with his view that the who failed to challenge China's early claims about the low risk of transmission among humans (see Science section).
However, winning hearts and minds is not proving easy for China, either. It does not help that, for all its propaganda about Chinese generosity, the value of China's donations is far eclipsed by that of its sales of medical kit (occasionally of low quality, buyers allege) on commercial terms. Between March 1st and April 4th China exported $i.45bn of medical supplies globally. Most of the sales to the rich world have been at market prices. By the time the train arrived in Madrid, Spain had already bought similar equipment from Chinese suppliers worth about 10,000 times as much as the stuff sent by rail.
It may be that China has not worked out an aid strategy, with a clear sense of which countries to target as a priority and how much should be given away free. Indeed, it has been happy to let companies, both state-owned and private, do much of the work. Some of the country's largest firms have taken up the challenge, but they are relative newcomers to philanthropy. They also have commercial interests at stake in many of the recipient countries.
Bounty from businessmen
Jack Ma, the billionaire co-founder of Alibaba, an e-commerce giant, has been at the forefront. Along with Alibaba's charitable foundation, he has sent planeloads of ventilators, protective kit and covid-19 tests for distribution to all 54 African countries. Huawei, a telecoms firm treated by America as a threat to its security, has already delivered a large share of its pledge of 500,000 masks, 50,000 goggles, 30,000 gowns and 120,000 gloves to hospitals in New York. The company has also donated millions of masks to countries that are pondering whether to allow Huawei into their 5G networks, including Canada and the Netherlands.
In parts of Europe, China's aid may have won admirers. A large billboard thanking ""big brother Xi"", paid for by a pro-government Serbian tabloid, appeared in Serbia's capital, Belgrade (see picture, previous page). Lucrezia Poggetti of merics, a thinktank in Berlin, says public discontent with the eu and distrust of Mr Trump's America has worked in China's favour. This month a poll commissioned by an Italian television station asked people which country they would prefer as an ally outside Europe. Of 800 respondents, 36% favoured China and only 30% chose America.
But to many in the West, China's propaganda drive sounds cynical, exploitive and forgetful of the aid that the West gave China at its time of need. In early February America and Europe sent 30 tons of medical supplies (much of it privately donated). President Emmanuel Macron of France complained that people talk of Chinese and Russian aid to Europe. ""But no one talks about France and Germany delivering 2m masks and tens of thousands of medical gowns to Italy,"" he said. The eu's foreignpolicy chief, Josep Borrell, warned about the ""politics of generosity"".
In poor countries, China's charity may prove more effective. In Africa the shipments are urneeded-a point that China's extensive media network on the continent is keen to highlight (news outlets across Africa use stories from Xinhua, China's state news agency). But America is still a far bigger donor on the continent and to the un. Last year China gave $368m to the UN's general budget, 55% of America's contribution (see chart above).
China's image has taken a severe hit in Africa as a result of the recent evictions of some Africans from their residences in the southern Chinese city of Guangzhou after reports that a few of them had been infected by covid-19. Images of Africans forced to sleep on the streets have been widely shared by social media in their native countries. The Daily Nation, a Kenyan newspaper, accused China of ""betrayal"". Several Chinese envoys in Africa have been summoned for dressings-down by host governments. China says it will gradually lift health-related restrictions on Africans in Guangzhou, and denies discrimination.
Among developing countries, China is as likely, if not more so, to win support by providing economic help as it is by giving medical aid. In Africa, China is the largest bilateral creditor, having lent more than $i40bn since 2000 (see bottom chart). On April 6th Ken Ofori-Atta, Ghana's finance minister, said China should ""come on stronger"" by restructuring or writing off some loans, which he said would require $8bn to service this year. The World Bank and the imf have proposed that creditors co-ordinate to provide debt relief.
On April 15th the G20, which includes China, agreed to allow developing countries to suspend debt payments to its members for the rest of the year. But when it comes to restructuring loans, China may prefer to go it alone rather than work closely with other lenders. In recent years it has been willing to change the terms of its debts, for instance last year those owed by the Republic of Congo. But it likes to act quietly, case-by-case. That way it can maintain the political leverage that its lending provides. Last year China reportedly cancelled $78m owed by Cameroon. A month later Cameroon withdrew its candidate (and the African Union's choice) for director-general of the Food and Agriculture Organisation, a un body, clearing the way for China's candidate to get the job. Some Western critics called this a quid pro quo.
During the pandemic, China has shown readiness to shake its fists as well as woo countries with kindness. Its deployment of ""sharp power"", as some call it, has been evident in its response to suggestions that China may have exacerbated the pandemic with its early cover-up. Chinese embassies in several countries have sputtered with outrage when prominent personalities, from the son of Brazil's president, Jair Bolsonaro, to Mario Vargas Llosa, a Peruvian author, have aired such a heretical thought. China's embassy in Lima accused Mr Vargas Llosa of making ""absurd and baseless criticisms"" of China in a column blaming the initial cover-up on China's dictatorial system. Some Chinese diplomats have even reacted with fury when people point out that the virus originated in China.
Chinese leaders do not offer a clear blueprint for shaping the global order. But back in 2017 Mr Xi gave a hint of China's long game when he proclaimed that it had taken ""a driving seat"" in international affairs and would be ""moving closer to centre stage and making greater contributions to mankind"". This does not appear to involve converting countries to Chinese-style socialism. China's aims are often self-defensive, to protect itself from criticism and challenges to its territorial claims. (When Bruce Aylward, an adviser to the who, pretended not to hear a reporter's question about Taiwan, China's media were delighted.) However, China does try to persuade others to adopt its peculiar view of human rights. It discounts individual freedoms, gives priority to economic development and thinks governments should police the internet as they wish.
Whether China will be able to take advantage of the pandemic to strengthen its global power will depend not least on the politics and economies of China and America post-covid. By stoking its economic growth following the global financial crisis of 2007-09, China gained much clout while the West slumped. It may not be able to replicate that effect this time: another massive dose of stimulus could cripple the country with debt. China is wary of repeating the tactic (see Finance section).
As the world emerges from the crisis, the West's attention is likely to become more focused on China's early handling of the outbreak, the reliability of its covid-related data and on Western vulnerability to China's control of vital supply-chains, not least in medical industries. Such issues could fuel anxieties about China's global influence and make it harder for China to shape the world to its liking. Should he win America's presidential election in November, Joe Biden may reassert a liberal vision of the world order, including support for multilateral institutions and regional alliances that have been disparaged and neglected by Mr Trump. And China may stumble. Another wave of infections could undermine the party's claims to superior handling of the disease. Soaring unemployment could exacerbate social tensions at home and deter China's leaders from engaging in a triumphalist march abroad.
For now, as America flounders, China appears a diffident leader at best. Its hesitancy was on display at the un last month, when it was China's turn to act as president of the Security Council. Throughout the month, it did not convene a single session about the pandemic. (On April 9th the council did hold one, but China insisted that the meeting, held by video-conference, be closed to the public.) Envoys to the un say China did not want to give America a chance to assign blame for the pandemic. ""It's irresponsible,"" says a Security Council diplomat. Instead two diehard rivals refuse to lead. One is in retreat; the other is uncertain whether it really wants to take on global responsibility. The world suffers.","Global influence

Brazil's beloved soap operas have been interrupted by the pandemic-and will be changed by it
Amor de māe"" (""Mother's Love"") is a te.Adenovela about three mothers from different social classes whose lives become entwined in Rio de Janeiro. Its run began in November on Rede Globo, Brazil's largest free television channel, in an evening slot that can attract a quarter of the population. Then, on March 16th, Globo shut its studios to combat the spread of covid-19, sending home some 9,000 workers and, for the first time ever, replacing ongoing soap operas with reruns. Neither military dictatorship nor the Rio Olympics halted production of Brazil's famous novelas, which are broadcast six days a week for single seasons of around 150 episodes apiece.
Manuela Dias, the writer of ""Amor de Mae"", and José Luiz Villamarim, its director, scrambled to re-edit existing footage to suspend the story on a cliffhanger. One of the mothers, Thelma, commits a murder to prevent another, Lurdes, finding out that Thelma's adopted child and Lurdes's longlost son are one and the same. That was the easy part. Now Globo, a huge media empire that broadcasts news, sports and entertainment, must answer the question facing television executives from Hollywood to Bollywood: how to bridge the gap between the pre- and post-pandemic worlds-and what to produce on the other side.
The filming of soap operas has been suspended in other countries, too, but nowhere will the hiatus matter more than in Brazil. Shoddy state-run schools and vast tv audiences mean that, as well as being a cherished form of entertainment, the shows are a vehicle for education and a mirror for current affairs. ""Novelas helped me understand a part of history that literature in school didn't show,"" says Ondina Saidy, a 61-year-old social worker. For instance, a corruption scandal in the 1980s inspired ""What King Am I?"", an allegory set in a European kingdom that poked fun at politicians. ""Avenida Brasil"", one of the most successful soaps in Brazilian history, depicted life in a favela, sparking conversations about race and class when it began in 2012. Rates of organ donation rose after the practice saved a popular character's life.
In short, says Maria Immacolata Vassallo de Lopes of the Centre for the Study of Telenovelas at the University of Sao Paulo, these shows are ""a resource capable of mobilising people"". They are also part of a global market: millions of Americans and Europeans watch Brazilian and Mexican novelas, even if ""K-Dramas"" from South Korea have begun to supplant them. (Colombians, for their part, prefer Turkish yarns.) Now this supply chain has ground to a halt, leaving fans bereft when they most need the consolation of melodrama.
To sustain the ritual viewing in Britain, the bbc is eking out episodes already in the can of ""EastEnders"", its flagship soap, scheduling two per week instead of four. In Mexico, Televisa has put scores of old telenovelas online to be streamed free. In Brazil, Globo is carefully selecting its reruns. They include a modern-day Cinderella tale and a historical drama with a sequel coming out later this year. Meanwhile, actors are connecting with fans on Facebook. Networks are exploring variety-show formats involving home-made videos-chefs in their own kitchens, quizzes in which celebrity panellists beam themselves in.
A rare holdout from the pre-covid era is ""Big Brother Brazil"" (bbb), a venerable real- 1 ity show that confines 20 attractive young people in a house together. Globo decided to keep filming even as versions in Canada and Italy ended early. The network reduced staff to minimise the risk of infection and on March 16th broke into the contestants' isolation to tell them about the pandemic; a similar scene played out on ""Big Brother Germany"". The ensuing tear-filled episodes drove up the already high ratings (Rede Globo's audience in March was its biggest in a decade: 38% of televisions in the country were tuned in). It is comforting to feel that ""the whole world is here, at the same time, living through the same emotion"", says bbb's director, J.B. Oliveira.
With novelas suspended, football cancelled and millions of Brazilians stuck at home, bbb has become a national pastime. Celebrities and politicians, including a son of President Jair Bolsonaro, have identified their favourite contestants on Twitter. A recent elimination round drew i.5bn online votes. In a habit previously reserved for football matches, Brazilians have been shouting at the screen. ""Stop that, for the love of God!"" cries Bianca Cardoso, the founder of a Facebook group for tv fans, when participants engage in what in the covid era seems like risky behaviour, such as sharing dishes and embracing.
Soon, she may not have to worry. Globo is considering banning kissing when production of novelas resumes, at least initially. Crowd scenes will also be avoided to limit the need for extras. Smooching will surely return (though some quarantine habits, such as videoconferencing, will doubtless linger both in life and on screen). But the pandemic's wider impact on television entertainment is unpredictable.

Experimenting with low-budget productions, as Globo has, could help in the long run, reckons Chico Barney, a Brazilian tv critic. Networks are anticipating a downturn after people return to work, audiences dip, advertising shrinks and subscriptions are cancelled. But there will still be demand for dramas, and-as is always true after such a seismic event-some are bound to focus on the pandemic. In Brazil, as elsewhere, the crisis has spotlighted the issue of inequality: wealthy travellers imported the virus, but poor people, who depend on the strained public health system, will suffer most. As in the past, soaps will reflect and shape viewers' understanding of what happened and why.
Ms Dias, the writer of ""Amor de Mae"", has returned to her storyboard, pondering one urgent question in particular. The novela is set in present-day Rio, but the bustling streets and mobbed beaches that it depicts now seem like relics of a bygone age. ""I agonised over what to do,"" she says. ""Do I let coronavirus into the novela, or do I spare my characters?""
Unlike the writers of ""The Archers"", a British radio drama about a fictional village where the virus will arrive in May, Ms Dias decided to be merciful. The novela already grapples with death and inequality, she figures, and by the time it returns Brazilians will be sick of hearing about the disease. ""The drama of whether or not Lurdes finds her son would turn into whether or not Lurdes gets coronavirus,"" she jokes. ""All the plot lines would become medical stories.""

 SĂO PAULO 
 Brazil 's beloved soap operas have been interrupted by the pandemic - and will be changed by it 
 Amor de māe "" ( "" Mother 's Love "" ) is a te . Adenovela about three mothers from different social classes whose lives become entwined in Rio de Janeiro . Its run began in November on Rede Globo , Brazil 's largest free television channel , in an evening slot that can attract a quarter of the population . Then , on March 16th , Globo shut its studios to combat the spread of covid-19 , sending home some 9,000 workers and , for the first time ever , replacing ongoing soap operas with reruns . Neither military dictatorship nor the Rio Olympics halted production of Brazil 's famous novelas , which are broadcast six days a week for single seasons of around 150 episodes apiece . 
 Manuela Dias , the writer of "" Amor de Mae "" , and José Luiz Villamarim , its director , scrambled to re - edit existing footage to suspend the story on a cliffhanger . One of the mothers , Thelma , commits a murder to prevent another , Lurdes , finding out that Thelma 's adopted child and Lurdes 's longlost son are one and the same . That was the easy part . Now Globo , a huge media empire that broadcasts news , sports and entertainment , must answer the question facing television executives from Hollywood to Bollywood : how to bridge the gap between the pre- and post - pandemic worlds - and what to produce on the other side . 
 The filming of soap operas has been suspended in other countries , too , but nowhere will the hiatus matter more than in Brazil . Shoddy state - run schools and vast tv audiences mean that , as well as being a cherished form of entertainment , the shows are a vehicle for education and a mirror for current affairs .

Covid-19 and debt restructuring will make or break the presidency of Alberto Fernández
Until recently advisers to Argentina's president, Alberto Fernández, quoted the old saw that crisis brings opportunity. Inaugurated in December, he is dealing with two calamities that no one can blame him for: a deep recession inherited from his predecessor, Mauricio Macri, and the covid-19 pandemic. Argentines give Mr Fernández high marks for his response. On becoming president he raised taxes and froze pensions and salaries to stabilise public finances. He acted early to slow the spread of covid-19, shutting borders, business and most transport by decree on March 12th. People who break the rules face fines and prison sentences.
The lockdown is having an effect. On April 23rd Argentina had 3,288 confirmed cases of covid-19 and 159 deaths from it. That is far fewer than in Spain, which has roughly the same number of people (though it may be an underestimate). Mr Fernández's approval rating has soared. A recent poll by Poliarquía puts it at 81%. ""I didn't think of him as a leader,"" says Gabriel Más, a farm worker. ""I do now.""
But both Mr Fernández and the country he leads are entering a dangerous phase. Pressure to ease the lockdown is building before the pandemic has peaked. And the government has begun a gambit to support the economy that may end up weakening it further. Success would be the making of his presidency and brighten the future of his Peronist political movement. Failure could be disastrous for both. ""Will he be the creator of a new political hegemony, or author of social chaos if he generates economic havoc?"" asked Jorge Fontevecchia, a media mogul, in a newspaper column.
On April 16th the economy minister, Martín Guzmán, demanded that creditors accept new securities to replace $65bnworth of bonds, almost 40% of foreigncurrency debt. This does not come out of the blue. Mr Macri had sought to stretch out debt payments. In appointing Mr Guzmán, a specialist in debt negotiation, Mr Fernández made it clear that he would give greater priority to restoring growth than to paying creditors.
The pandemic greatly increases the urgency. With revenue crushed by recession, the government is on track to run a primary deficit, ie, before interest payments, of at least 4% of gdp this year. The Central Bank is printing money to keep the government going, which risks driving up inflation, already at 50%. Over the next two years Argentina's scheduled payments of foreigncurrency debt are nearly as large as its foreign-exchange reserves of less than $44bn. ""Argentina can't pay [creditors] anything right now,"" says Mr Guzmán. So far, though, bondholders are unsympathetic. Argentina's demand ""does not represent the product of good-faith negotiations"", complained one group that holds about 16% of the debt.
The mood in the Casa Rosada, the presidential palace, is grim. Argentina may be headed for its ninth default. ""Between pandemic and debt, now maybe default, it looks like double jeopardy,"" says a presidential adviser. The consequences of default would be grisly. Output, squeezed by the lockdown, would shrink by far more than the 5.7% forecast by the imf for this year. The peso would plunge, pushing inflation even higher. Unemployment and poverty would soar. Despite a history of default, ""even we may not recognise what's coming: economic meltdown and social unrest, alongside a pandemic,"" warns Sergio Berensztein, a political analyst.
The government wants to wring the maximum relief it can from bondholders without triggering that disaster. Mr Guzmán is seeking a modest ""haircut"" of 5.4% on the principal (which would save the government $3.6bn) and a dramatic 62% cut in interest payments. These payments would start low, at just 0.5%, and late, beginning in 2023, when an election is due. They would peak in 2029 at less than 5%. Under this plan, the government would save $37.9bn on its interest bill.
The absence of even a token payment until May 2023 will stiffen creditors' resistance. With no prospect of money coming in, they could spend the next three years lobbying and litigating for a better deal. They complain that the government has been slow to disclose its strategy for servicing the debt that would remain. The plans it has released so far do not take into account the effects of covid-19. ""If you're a creditor, told to wait three years, you need to hear the plan,"" says a source close to both investors and the government.
There is little time to resolve the tussle. The Fernández team put a 20-day limit on negotiations. But the real deadline is May 22nd, the end of the 30-day grace period for a missed $500m payment. ""There is recognition that default is much more likely than not,"" says the presidential adviser.
Veterans of past renegotiations hold out hope of an agreement. Argentina's offer preserves much of the face value of the debt. There may be wriggle-room in the schedule for repayment. The price of Argentina's existing bonds rose after it made its proposal, a sign that the offer is more appealing than investors were expecting. Government negotiators are ""pushing it to the cliff-edge, as they must, to remind all that default is a disaster for all"", says a former finance minister.
Mr Fernández is using brinkmanship, too, in his battle with the pandemic. ""Quarantine, social distancing, will extend beyond April,"" said Pedro Cahn, a government epidemiologist. Even then, ""we have to expect many more cases and many more deaths."" Workers in private hospitals say that the government's low numbers for covid-19 cases and fatalities reflect a lack of testing. They fear ""dramatic loss of life"" when the virus peaks, probably in early June, in poor neighbourhoods that ring Buenos Aires and in other cities.
Mr Fernández is trying to shield poor Argentines from the consequences of the lockdown, in part by taxing richer ones. The government has given bonus payments to welfare recipients, informal workers and people who work in health care, policing and supermarkets. It has imposed new freezes on prices of food and medical supplies. Congress may reconvene to levy a tax on Argentines' worldwide assets. The ""patriotic"" tax will ""kill the chicken that lays the eggs for future recovery"", warns Aldo Abram, an economist.
The pre-existing recession makes the trade-off between public health and economic growth even more painful than it is for most countries. Under pressure from trade unions and business, Mr Fernández has allowed organisations in 11 sectors, including export industries and refuges for victims of domestic violence, to reopen. But he is likely to rule out a quick return to normality like that advocated by Brazil's president, Jair Bolsonaro, who makes light of covid-19. Mr Fernández knows that the pandemic is more merciless than Argentina's creditors. -","Argentina

They complain that the government has been slow to disclose its strategy for servicing the debt that would remain. The plans it has released so far do not take into account the effects of covid-19. ""If you're a creditor, told to wait three years, you need to hear the plan,"" says a source close to both investors and the government.
There is little time to resolve the tussle. The Fernández team put a 20-day limit on negotiations. But the real deadline is May 22nd, the end of the 30-day grace period for a missed $500m payment. ""There is recognition that default is much more likely than not,"" says the presidential adviser.
Veterans of past renegotiations hold out hope of an agreement. Argentina's offer preserves much of the face value of the debt. There may be wriggle-room in the schedule for repayment. The price of Argentina's existing bonds rose after it made its proposal, a sign that the offer is more appealing than investors were expecting. Government negotiators are ""pushing it to the cliff-edge, as they must, to remind all that default is a disaster for all"", says a former finance minister.
Mr Fernández is using brinkmanship, too, in his battle with the pandemic. ""Quarantine, social distancing, will extend beyond April,"" said Pedro Cahn, a government epidemiologist. Even then, ""we have to expect many more cases and many more deaths."" Workers in private hospitals say that the government's low numbers for covid-19 cases and fatalities reflect a lack of testing. They fear ""dramatic loss of life"" when the virus peaks, probably in early June, in poor neighbourhoods that ring Buenos Aires and in other cities.
Mr Fernández is trying to shield poor Argentines from the consequences of the lockdown, in part by taxing richer ones. The government has given bonus payments to welfare recipients, informal workers and people who work in health care, policing and supermarkets. It has imposed new freezes on prices of food and medical supplies. Congress may reconvene to levy a tax on Argentines' worldwide assets. The ""patriotic"" tax will ""kill the chicken that lays the eggs for future recovery"", warns Aldo Abram, an economist.
The pre-existing recession makes the trade-off between public health and economic growth even more painful than it is for most countries. Under pressure from trade unions and business, Mr Fernández has allowed organisations in 11 sectors, including export industries and refuges for victims of domestic violence, to reopen. But he is likely to rule out a quick return to normality like that advocated by Brazil's president, Jair Bolsonaro, who makes light of covid-19. Mr Fernández knows that the pandemic is more merciless than Argentina's creditors. -",140,Brazil,ctb-140-2,,False,,0,True

Would-be strongmen are using the pandemic as an excuse to grab more power
On april чти, during a discussion about when and how America should ease covid-19 lockdowns, Donald Trump claimed to have ""absolute power"" to decide, overriding state governors. Within a day, he was forced to retreat. No serious legal scholar agreed with him-America's constitution is admirably clear on the limits to presidential authority.
Contrast that with Viktor Orban's efforts. On March 30th Hungary's parliament issued a ""coronavirus law"", giving the prime minister almost unlimited powers to rule by decree, with no expiry date. Parliament can repeal Mr Orban's new powers, but since his party has an impregnable majority, it probably won't. Mr Orban has in effect become a dictator-in the heart of Europe. He may relinquish some of his new powers after the pandemic, just to prove his critics wrong, but perhaps not all.
Covid-19 is creating opportunities for autocrats and would-be autocrats to tighten their grip. They must assume extraordinary powers, they insist, to protect public health. No fewer than 84 countries have declared a state of emergency since the pandemic began, says the Centre for Civil and Political Rights, a watchdog in Geneva. Some will surrender these powers when the emergency is over. Others plan to hang on to them. The danger is greatest not in mature democracies with strong checks and balances, such as America, but in places where such safeguards are weak, such as Hungary.
Mr Orban has spent the past decade eroding checks on his power, nobbling the courts, tilting the electoral system and urging his cronies to gobble up independent radio and television stations. Mr Trump's claim of absolute power was laughed at; Hungarian media welcomed Mr Orban's corona coronation, and Hungarian institutions did nothing to block it.
Unscrupulous politicians have seen opportunity in disaster before. Vladimir Putin grabbed extra powers after a school siege involving terrorists in Beslan, a town near Russia's border with Georgia. Turkey's President Recep Tayyip Erdogan imposed a state of emergency after a failed coup in 2016, and has since ruled like a sultan. This pandemic presents an even greater opportunity for mischief, because it is raging everywhere at once. The world's attention is on the virus. No repressive act in a far-off land is likely to make headlines elsewhere.
China chose now to arrest Hong Kong's leading pro-democracy activists and puncture its Basic Law (see China section). ""Dictators and others may think there's no better time to take repressive measures,"" says Rob Malley of the International Crisis Group, an ngo in Brussels.
Serbia's president is in effect in sole charge. Togo's has the power to rule by decree, though in theory it runs out in a few months. Cambodia's emergency law gives the government the power to take any ""measures that are deemed appropriate"" to fight the disease. It can restrict people's movement, ban public gatherings, censor social media, seize property and declare martial law. Anyone who fails to ""respect"" the law faces up to ten years in prison. The prime minister, Hun Sen, can act without any real oversight. Though his ministers say the measures will last for only three months, they can be extended indefinitely.
Such powers far exceed any that democratic governments have assumed to fight covid-19, but the regimes in question try to portray them as normal. ""The purpose of making this law for Cambodia is not un-1 · ique, as there is this law already in many other democratic countries,"" says a spokesman for the ministry of justice.
Some curbs on freedom are reasonable given the scale of the emergency. Large gatherings can spread infection, so limiting them for a while makes sense. But it also helps regimes keen to snuff out protests. Algeria banned street marches that have lasted, off and on, for a year, threatening the elderly ruling elite. India's lockdown has squashed nationwide rallies against the government's mistreatment of Muslims. In Russia even lone protesters against Mr Putin have been arrested.
Social-distancing rules can be applied selectively. Azerbaijan's president says the ""isolation"" of members of the opposition may ""become a historical necessity"". Several have been locked up for supposedly violating a lockdown. Unpopular minorities are also at risk. In Uganda police raided a shelter housing 20 gay and transgender people and later charged them with ""congesting in a school-like-dormitory setting within a small house"".
Defeating the virus will require tracking who has been infected, tracing their contacts and quarantining them. This may involve intrusive surveillance. Most people will surrender some privacy temporarily to save lives. Good governments will take only the data they need from their citizens and do so only when they need it. Others will not.
Cambodia's emergency law allows for unlimited surveillance of private citizens. Moscow is mulling a scheme whereby everyone would have to register their personal details on an official website. Every time they want to go out, they would have to provide a reason and the address of their destination. They will then be sent an electronic message to show to the police if they are stopped. The authorities would monitor everyone's geolocation and even financial records to make sure they comply. The potential for abuse is obvious.
Spreading rumours during a pandemic can be dangerous. Many regimes have used this as an excuse to crack down on critics. Reporters without Borders, a watchdog, cites 38 countries that have used covid-19 as a pretext to harass the media. It stresses that the list is not exhaustive.
In Turkey at least eight journalists have been arrested on charges of ""spreading misinformation"". Hundreds of others have been investigated for critical posts on social media. In Bolivia the interim president, Jeanine Áñez, decreed that those who ""misinform or cause uncertainty to the population"" can be jailed for one to ten years. Since she has a record of forcing opposition radio stations off the air, critics fear this will become a tool to lock them up.
Some governments have criminalised almost any disparagement of their response to the pandemic. A Thai artist called Danai Ussama faces up to five years in prison after griping that no one took his temperature at Bangkok airport.
""Censorship kills,"" says Kenneth Roth of Human Rights Watch. ""When governments suppress the free flow of information, it is terrible for public health, as we saw in Wuhan. The Chinese government's muzzling of the doctors who sounded the warning gave the virus a three-week headstart to go global."" A study by the University of Southampton found that if interventions in China had started three weeks earlier, the number of coronavirus cases would have been 95% lower at the end of February, ""significantly limiting the geographical spread of the disease.""
Some governments are enforcing lockdowns harshly. Several Indian states now allow the police to arrest people without charge. In Fiji there have been more coronavirus-related arrests than diagnostic tests. Kenyan cops have beaten health workers on their way to work.
In El Salvador more than 2,000 people have been locked up for violating strict social-distancing rules, often defeating their purpose. Its Supreme Court has told the government to stop arbitrarily detaining people in inhumane conditions that are likely to spread the disease. But its fiery president, Nayib Bukele, has refused (via Twitter) to obey it. Thus, covid-19 has precipitated a constitutional crisis in one of Latin America's most violent countries.
Getting la grippe
Indonesia and the Philippines have given the army prime responsibility for fighting the novel coronavirus. In some ways this is pragmatic: only the armed forces can operate effectively across these two archipelago states. They are also popular. ""They abhor useless debates. They are silent workers, not voracious talkers. They act without fanfare. They get things done,"" said a spokesman for Rodrigo Duterte, the president of the Philippines. Even so, there are worries. Mr Duterte has publicly urged the security forces to shoot troublemakers dead. Fortunately, they appear to have ignored him, but in the long run, turning to the men in uniform during a public-health crisis risks weakening civilian oversight.
The pandemic is seriously disrupting elections. South Korea showed in April that a well-governed rich country can organise a vote while maintaining social distance. Poorer, less orderly places find it harder. For some leaders, that is a welcome excuse to delay their reckoning with voters.
Court-ordered re-runs of rigged elections in Bolivia have been postponed. Those in Malawi could be delayed, too. That would leave the presidency with Peter Mutharika, whose victory last year was ruled invalid after his supporters used Tipp-Ex to alter vote tallies.
Some leaders are holding votes on schedule, knowing that the opposition will barely be able to campaign, whereas the incumbent can look statesmanlike on television. Poland's ruling party wants to go ahead with a presidential election in May for this reason, though it could still be delayed. Guinea held a referendum on March 22nd to allow President Alpha Condé to run for two more terms. The proposal passed easily. Guinea now has almost 700 covid-19 cases and possibly 12 more years of Mr Condé, who has advised Guineans to inhale menthol and drink hot water to ward off the virus.
Ethiopia's elections, which are set for August, were supposed to herald the dawn 1 · of a new democratic era. They have been postponed and the government has assumed emergency powers. During previous states of emergency in 2016 and 2018, tens of thousands of dissidents were locked up in re-education camps or tortured. The current prime minister, Abiy Ahmed, has promised that such abuses are all in the past. But if elections are not held by September, his government will no longer have a mandate, and Ethiopia's ethnic insurgencies could explode.
Strongman flu
Some governments have used the disease itself to intimidate the opposition. Crowded jails are hotbeds of infection. Dissidents understand that detention could be lethal. Turkey has ordered a mass release of up to 90,000 prisoners to spare them from contracting covid-19. The country's thousands of political prisoners are conspicuously excluded from the amnesty.
Some governments are looking for scapegoats. In India that means Muslims. After it was discovered that a Muslim religious meeting on March 15th was the source of more than 1,000 infections, the Hindu nationalist government made every effort to publicise this fact. For several days the ministry of health counted separately covid cases tied to the event. A cabinet member likened it to a crime by the Taliban. Health authorities assiduously traced every single case from the Delhi meeting, ultimately putting some 25,000 people under quarantine. They have made no such effort with any other vector, such as the huge wedding party of a ruling-party bigwig. #CoronaJihad proliferated on social media, along with rumours that Muslims were spitting in people's food to spread the virus. Muslims have been attacked in the streets. A cancer hospital in Meerut said that it would not take Muslim patients unless they tested negative for covid-19.
Blaming Muslims is a handy way to fire up Hindu nationalist voters and distract attention from the fact that, at the time of the notorious Muslim prayer meeting, the government had yet to take the virus seriously. ""Having spent years painting [Muslims] as a demographic, cultural, sexual, and security threat, it is now busily painting them as a biohazard,"" complains Mitali Saran in the Deccan Herald.
Such bigotry not only stokes violence; it also harms public health. Many Muslims are now so suspicious of the government that they are unwilling to co-operate with quarantine rules. In Muslim slums medics have been attacked because of rumours that they are gathering data on Muslims in order to harm them. It was not until April 19th that the prime minister, Narendra Modi, made any effort to soothe sectarian tempers. ""Covid-19 does not see race, religion, colour, caste, creed, language or borders,"" he tweeted. ""We are in this together.""
Many leaders want credit for handing out taxpayers' cash to tide people over during the crisis. Mr Modi is leaning on rich Indians as well as government workers to donate to a special ""pm-cares"" relief fund. It is unclear how the new pot differs from an emergency relief fund that Indian prime ministers have run since 1948, except that it has less oversight and Mr Modi can claim to have launched it.
Some rulers are equally keen that their opponents should get no credit for helping the needy. Turkey is investigating the opposition mayors of Istanbul and Ankara for trying to raise funds to fight covid-19. Mr Erdogan likened them to terrorists. In Uganda President Yoweri Museveni cautions that ""opportunistic politicians who try to distribute food will be arrested and charged with attempted murder."" His government claims that chaotic food distribution will draw crowds that will spread the virus. His foes think he wants to stop them from looking good by doing good.
For now, covid-19 is helping autocrats grab more power. But it poses big risks for them, too. The damage it wreaks will be vast and painful, especially in poor countries. Many despots will struggle to protect their subjects from disease and deprivation. Mr Putin is losing popularity because of his aloof response to the virus. Brazil's Jair Bolsonaro, who scoffs at lockdowns and recently led a rally where placard-wavers called for a coup, could be impeached for incompetence after this crisis. Some are flailing. President Alexander Lukashenko of Belarus said the best way to fight the virus was to drink vodka and drive a tractor.
Some regimes may run out of money. Venezuela's dictator, Nicolás Maduro, looks particularly vulnerable. The combination of covid-19 and an oil-price crash may leave his regime without enough cash to fund its patronage network-and to keep the army loyal. Covid-19 challenges many regimes that rely on the security forces to suppress dissent.
Where governments are seen as legitimate, and where they try to ease the economic pain, people are more likely to comply with lockdowns. In many countries, however, the state is seen as predatory and the police as bullies. In them a backlash is brewing that thuggish cops will struggle to control. Protests against lockdowns have erupted in many countries, including parts of China. More may follow if the pandemic lasts for months, as it probably will.
Pandemocrats
Many autocrats fear losing control. An incident in Cambodia is suggestive. Mr Hun Sen admitted in an unguarded moment that his government lacks the money to tide people over during the outbreak. ""If motorbike-taxi drivers go bankrupt, sell your motorbikes for spending money,"" he said. When a director of a news site accurately quoted this insensitive comment, it was shut down and he was arrested.
Seven years ago Mr Hun Sen was rattled by huge protests by disgruntled factory workers. Cambodia's garment factories are now laying off workers, who are more desperate and angry than before. In many countries covid-19 may foster instability. Autocracies have no immunity. -","Covid-19 and autocracy

Jair Bolsonaro's justice minister resigns and calls the president a scofflaw
On april гэги Brazil's president, Jair Bolsonaro, climbed onto a lorry outside army headquarters in Brasilia to fire up protesters who were calling for a shutdown of Congress and the Supreme Court. Soon after, according to Folha de S. Paulo, a newspaper, he learned that federal police were investigating allegations that one of his sons, Carlos, runs an online fake-news network that may have inspired the protest. On April 24th Mr Bolsonaro sacked the head of the federal police. Hours later the justice minister, Sérgio Moro, resigned. He accused the president on television of ""political interference"" in the police to shield his family.
Mr Moro's resignation is the biggest political blow to Mr Bolsonaro since he became president at the beginning of 2019. An army captain turned congressman, Mr Bolsonaro rose from obscurity by exploiting anger at corruption. His appointment as justice minister of Mr Moro, a judge who jailed scores of politicians and businessmen as leader of the Lava Jato (Car Wash) anti-corruption investigations, signalled his determination to fight graft. Now Mr Moro, a hero to many Brazilians, has accused his former boss of obstructing justice. If an investigation backs that claim, Mr Bolsonaro could be impeached.
That crisis comes on top of twin calamities: the covid-19 pandemic and the economic slump it has caused. On April 16th Mr Bolsonaro sacked the health minister, Luiz Mandetta, who had refused to back his demands that shops and schools reopen. Some supporters are disillusioned. ""I voted for Bolsonaro in hopes of a better Brazil,"" says Ary, a taxi driver in the north-eastern city of Maceió. ""But it was all in vain.""
The allegations against Carlos Bolsonaro are not the first to be levelled against the president's family. Before he took office prosecutors opened an investigation into possible embezzlement by his eldest son, Flávio, now a senator from Rio de Janeiro. Documents published by the Intercept, a news site, suggest he used public money to finance illegal construction projects run by right-wing ""militias"". Now Mr Moro has accused the president himself.
Mr Bolsonaro's survival in office depends on three factors. The first is the probe triggered by Mr Moro. Its outcome may depend on whether the president's alleged misconduct achieves its aim. Things are not going as he might wish. The person he appointed to be the new police chief is a family friend. But on April 29th a Supreme Court judge put the appointment on hold. Mr Bolsonaro says he will appeal that decision. The judge had earlier ruled that a new chief could not change the officers leading investigations into the actions of Mr Bolsonaro's sons, who deny wrongdoing.
The second arena of judgment is Congress, which can evict a president from office by a two-thirds majority of both houses. To avoid this, Mr Bolsonaro is cosying up to the centrāo, a block of ideologically vacant parties. He has abandoned his earlier pledge not to give legislators benefits, such as government jobs for their allies, in exchange for political support. Impeachment ""is not in Congress's interest"", says Ricardo Barros, a federal deputy from the Progressives party, part of the centrāo.
That could change, he admits, if the president loses the support of voters, the third and most important influence on Mr Bolsonaro's future. Before Dilma Rousseff 1 was impeached in 2016 her approval rating dropped to 8% and she faced huge protests. Mr Bolsonaro remains strongly supported by a third of voters. According to Datafolha, a pollster, 46% of Brazilians want him to resign, a rise of nine percentage points within a month. But half think he should stay.
""People are starting to say: 'I was wrong,'"" says Renan Santos, the leader of the right-wing Free Brazil Movement, which organised protests against Ms Rousseff and initially supported Mr Bolsonaro but now calls for his impeachment. For the first time since 2017, Mr Bolsonaro has lost Facebook fans.
Whatever the popular verdict, Mr Bolsonaro's presidency lost much of its purpose when Mr Moro resigned. Its other main justification, the reform programme led by the liberal economy minister, Paulo Guedes, is endangered by the recession. He wants to slash spending, simplify taxes and privatise state enterprises. Now the government must splash out. It has promised tens of millions of Brazilians a monthly payment of 600 reais ($110). That will cost 118bn reais this year, about 1.6% of gdp. On April 22nd the government announced a ""recovery plan"" to employ 1m people through sketchily defined infrastructure projects. Mr Guedes was not consulted. Rumours flew that he would follow Mr Moro out of the door.
The financial markets' confidence in Brazil depends on Mr Guedes staying put. Knowing this, Mr Bolsonaro paraded him before journalists on April 27th and backed down from the public-works plan, for now. Even so, ""reforms aren't going to happen,"" says Eduardo Cury, a federal deputy from the centre-right Party of Brazilian Social Democracy. ""Guedes will have to hang his head or go home.""
His marginalisation leaves the government in the hands of ideologues and generals. The ideologues reinforce Mr Bolsonaro's strongest preferences, for example to loosen gun controls. The soldiers, who occupy seven of 22 cabinet posts (including all four with offices in the presidential palace), sometimes restrain him. They tempered his hostility towards China, Brazil's biggest trading partner. ""They believe they're capable of doing something important for the government at a time when it's very chaotic,"" says a retired general. But they are in tune with Mr Bolsonaro on developing the Amazon and favour bulking up the state's economic role.
Some officers may have second thoughts about backing his imploding presidency, says a scholar who studies Brazil's army. But their sense of duty will keep them loyal. Impeachment would not diminish their role. Hamilton Mourāo, the vice-president, was a serving general until 2018. If the military-minded president is removed, he will leave a martial legacy. -","Brazil

Nayib Bukele may be trying to become Latin America's first millennial dictator
When he became president of El Salvador last year, Nayib Bukele promised change. A millennial who knows that a selfie is worth 1,000 words, he broke the grip of the two parties that had governed since the end of a civil war in 1992. On their watch El Salvador's murder rate became the world's highest and Salvadoreans left the country in droves. Three of the past four presidents have been charged with corruption. ""You bastards, return what's been stolen!"" Mr Bukele demanded before the election. He gave his victory speech in jeans and a leather jacket.
But in his nmonths as president he has done more to wreck El Salvador's democracy than to reform it. In February he entered the Legislative Assembly with soldiers to bully it into financing his crime-fighting programme. With the outbreak of covid-19 his contempt for democratic norms has only grown. Mr Bukele may be on course to become Latin America's first millennial dictator.
He exemplifies a worrying trend. Until recently democracy seemed established in most of Latin America. The main exceptions were three countries ruled by leftist despots: Cuba, Venezuela and Nicaragua. Now some democracies are wobbling. Honduras's president, Juan Orlando Hernández, engineered the abolition of a presidential term limit and in 2017 was re-elected in a flawed vote. Protesters in Bolivia forced Evo Morales, anoth-1 · er term-limit dodger, out of office (and the country) after he apparently tried to rig his re-election last October. With covid-19 as her alibi the interim president, Jeanine Áñez, is amassing power and seeking to delay an election. Brazil's populist president, Jair Bolsonaro, eggs on supporters who call for shutting down Congress and the Supreme Court.
Mr Bukele has gone still further (see Americas section). He moved fast to contain the spread of covid-19, imposing a national lockdown on March 21st, when the country had just three confirmed cases. In the name of protecting citizens, he has trampled their rights. Police have arrested more than 2,000 people for violating the quarantine rules and confined them for up to 30 days in conditions that make the spread of the disease more likely.
The Supreme Court has ruled that the state cannot detain people without a law to back it up. Mr Bukele has defied it. ""Five people are not going to decide the death of hundreds of thousands of Salvadoreans,"" he tweeted. Security forces took his orders to enforce his lockdown, issued via Twitter, as lawful commands. (The legislature has now passed a law authorising detentions.)
Mr Bukele lashed out again when murders jumped last month after a long decline. He encouraged police to use ""lethal force"" on criminals and ordered jailed members of rival gangs to be confined in the same cells. Mr Bukele's office released pictures of hundreds of near-naked prisoners, packed together closer than battery chickens while their cells were inspected.
So far, Mr Bukele has paid no price for his brutishness. Citizens believe he is trying to protect them. Nearly 80% approve of his handling of the pandemic. In an election due next February, his New Ideas party will probably gain control of the legislature.
How long he plans to hold on to all this power is unclear. Sitting presidents may not run for re-election. Mr Bukele might try to lift that term limit before the election in 2024. Or perhaps one of his relatives, the main powerbrokers in his government, will be on the ballot. Either way, democracy would suffer.
America should rein him in, but will not. Mr Bukele has ingratiated himself with President Donald Trump by agreeing to stop migrants from other countries from heading towards the United States. A pandemic-induced economic slump might erase Mr Bukele's popularity. But by then it may be hard to get rid of him. Salvadoreans must find ways to check him now. -","El Salvador
Nayib Bukele may be trying to become Latin America's first millennial dictator
When he became president of El Salvador last year, Nayib Bukele promised change. A millennial who knows that a selfie is worth 1,000 words, he broke the grip of the two parties that had governed since the end of a civil war in 1992. On their watch El Salvador's murder rate became the world's highest and Salvadoreans left the country in droves. Three of the past four presidents have been charged with corruption. ""You bastards, return what's been stolen!"" Mr Bukele demanded before the election. He gave his victory speech in jeans and a leather jacket.
But in his nmonths as president he has done more to wreck El Salvador's democracy than to reform it. In February he entered the Legislative Assembly with soldiers to bully it into financing his crime-fighting programme. With the outbreak of covid-19 his contempt for democratic norms has only grown. Mr Bukele may be on course to become Latin America's first millennial dictator.
He exemplifies a worrying trend. Until recently democracy seemed established in most of Latin America. The main exceptions were three countries ruled by leftist despots: Cuba, Venezuela and Nicaragua. Now some democracies are wobbling. Honduras's president, Juan Orlando Hernández, engineered the abolition of a presidential term limit and in 2017 was re-elected in a flawed vote. Protesters in Bolivia forced Evo Morales, anoth-1 · er term-limit dodger, out of office (and the country) after he apparently tried to rig his re-election last October. With covid-19 as her alibi the interim president, Jeanine Áñez, is amassing power and seeking to delay an election.

The crisis exposes our weaknesses. Will our leaders choose reform or calamity?
In the winter of 1788-89, the desperate government of Louis XVI asked the French people to send in lists of their grievances. It was a fatal mistake. The cahiers de doléances served to articulate the public's unspoken discontent and, equally important, its hopes for a better world. A crucial psychological barrier had fallen: it became possible to imagine a very different France. And the times- the moral and actual bankruptcy of the Ancien Régime, widespread crop failures and hopeless leadership-gave shape to the public's aspirations. The fuse was lit for revolution.
France in 1789. Russia in 1917. The Europe of the 1930s. The pandemic of 2020. They are all junctures where the river of history changes direction. The covid-19 crisis may be a pivotal rather than a revolutionary moment but it, too, is challenging the old order. Like France's cahiers, the coronavirus forces questions about what sort of future we want, what the proper role of government is and what makes a healthy society. We face a choice: to build better ways of dealing domestically and internationally with this challenge (and prepare for inevitable future ones) or let our world become meaner and more selfish, divided and suspicious.
Long before covid-19, popular thinkers like Thomas Piketty, the late Tony Judt and Paul Krugman were warning about deep social inequalities and the shortcomings of globalisation. There were sporadic protests like Occupy Wall Street or France's gilets jaunes. Most of us (such is human nature) carried on living. We worried from time to time about climate change, that our children couldn't afford houses and that there seemed to be more obscenely rich people along with more homeless ones. Covid-19 has turned a spotlight on the dark sides of our world. We have become aware of the fragility of international supply lines, the disadvantages of offshore sources for critical goods and the limits of international bodies. The chaotic responses and blame games of certain governments have exacerbated divisions in and among societies, perhaps permanently. America has withdrawn from moral and material leadership of the world. It and China have grown more hostile to one another, not less. Rogue states such as Russia gleefully make more trouble and the un is increasingly marginalised.
When you name things-grievances, say, as the French did- you give them form and make it harder to ignore them. We are doing that now with the flaws in our world and spelling out our hopes for something better. As the French looked at Britain and America as models, we can see that South Korea, Denmark and New Zealand have controlled the pandemic more effectively than other countries, in part because their peoples have faith in the authorities and each other. Without trust-that the water is clean, medicines are safe, or thugs won't get away with it-societies are vulnerable. Covid-19 has caused fewer deaths proportionately in Germany than elsewhere because of the country's well-funded health system and its competent state and federal governments. As history shows, those societies that survive and adapt best to catastrophes are already strong. Britain rose to the challenge of the Nazis because it was united; France was not and did not.
Much also depended then, and depends now, on leaders. As weaknesses are exposed, do leaders fix or exploit them? While Franklin Roosevelt was promising Americans a better tomorrow in the 1930s, Adolf Hitler was destroying the Weimar Republic and intoxicating Germans with promises of revenge for the Treaty of Versailles. As we know, that ended in a world war.
For every Jacinda Ardern or Angela Merkel, the leaders of New Zealand and Germany who are talking to their citizens about the difficult road ahead, there is an illiberal, populist demagogue playing to baser fears and fantasies. In Brazil President Jair Bolsonaro dismisses covid-19 as ""the sniffles""; in India the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party blames it on the Muslims. President Donald Trump claimed he had ""total"" authority, demonstrating something about his instincts if not his knowledge of the American constitution.
Wise leaders in the past have been able to steer away from danger. In 1830 Britain was coping with unrest in Ireland, violent strikes at home and demands for more power from the growing commercial and industrial middle classes. The enlightened aristocrats of the new Whig government believed that they had a choice between revolution and reform, even if the latter was at the expense of their own power and privilege. In 1832 their Great Reform Act widened the franchise for Parliament. The Whigs did not remove all grievances, but they muted them. A century later another child of privilege, Roosevelt, brought in the New Deal which helped to save American society and capitalism.
The present crisis could be the opportunity for strategies to produce essential public goods and ensure that citizens have safe, decent and fulfilled lives. People coming out of a calamity are open to sweeping changes. Governments will find it hard to resist demands for improved social programmes now that they are spending as though John Maynard Keynes were in the room. Will the British again accept an underfunded National Health Service? And countries could invest in key organisations like the World Health Organisation and give it greater power to protect the world from disease. Perhaps, just perhaps, bodies such as the G7 and G20 could become forums for unity and not dissent.
Future historians, if there are any who can still research and speak freely, will analyse the choices that individual countries and the world made. Let us hope the story shows the better angels of our nature, in Abraham Lincoln's words: enlightened leaders and publics creating together sane and inclusive policies, and strengthening our vital institutions at home and abroad. The alternative story will not have a happy ending.","By invitation

Many a regime has been toppled by a plague, but so far covid-19 is having the opposite effect. Most leaders have seen their approval ratings rise, even as the disease has killed at least 250,000 people. Morning Consult, a pollster, has found that a group of ten politicians have enjoyed an average gain of nine percentage points since the World Health Organisation declared a pandemic on March 11th. The sentiment has been felt widely: in Australia and Canada, India and Germany.
Academics call this pattern the ""rallyround-the-flag"" effect. It has often benefited American presidents during international crises. Studies have found that surging patriotism and meeker opposition both contribute. Yet not all catastrophes are a boon. George W. Bush's lacklustre response to Hurricane Katrina in 2005 punctured his ratings. Tony Blair's fell after Islamists bombed London in 2005, as did François Hollande's after the Paris attacks in 2015. Perhaps voters felt they had failed to police domestic terrorism well, whereas Americans saw the attacks in 2001as an act of war.
Today, voters have rallied round leaders who took covid-19 seriously. The largest bounces are in Australia, Canada and Germany, where death rates have been low among rich Western countries. Despite France's bad outbreak, a solemn Emmanuel Macron has gained some credit. Britons got behind Boris Johnson at first. A recent dip may reflect fears that a tardy lockdown led to thousands of extra deaths.
The four leaders who have fared least well stand accused of ineptitude. Japan's response to the outbreak compares well with most countries', but not with its Asian neighbours. The presidents of America, Mexico and Brazil have all suggested that fears about covid-19 are overblown. Andrés Manuel López Obrador (amlo) and Donald Trump have seen only modest bounces. Jair Bolsonaro has lost nine points.
The effects for ruling parties have been smaller. Angela Merkel's cdu/csu has risen by ten points, with others in single figures-suggesting that voters are rallying round leaders, not governments. History also shows that patriotic boosts are brief and recessions are costly in the polls.
Mr Trump is the only leader of the ten facing a vote soon. Despite 70,000 deaths, few Americans have changed their opinions of him yet, but he cannot afford to lose many supporters before November.","The ratings boost enjoyed by politicians will probably fade

TOKYO
Voters are unimpressed by the prime minister's handling of covid-19
Since japan recorded its first case of covid-19 on January 16th, 784 people have died across the country of 126m, fewer deaths than in one day in New York City during the peak of the outbreak there. On May 14th the government lifted the state of emergency in 39 of Japan's 47 prefectures, with more likely to be released this week. In terms of deaths relative to population, Japan ranks alongside South Korea, whose government has been widely praised for its management of the pandemic.
Yet when it comes to public opinion, Abe Shinzo, Japan's prime minister, has been one of a small handful of world leaders to see his approval ratings drop, alongside covid-deniers like Brazil's Jair Bolsonaro. Polls show that more than half of the Japanese public disapproves of the government's handling of the virus. Limited testing, shortages of protective gear for medical workers, the botched handling of a super-spreading cruise ship and hesitation to impose a state of emergency have fuelled frustration and distrust. ""Citizens and the private sector were far ahead of the government,"" says Nakabayashi Mieko, a former opposition mp. On May 19th Japan's national broadcaster, nhk, found that more people disapproved than approved of Mr Abe's government (see chart).
Mr Abe has cultivated the image of himself as a strong leader. But faced with covid-19 ""he has not acted like the leader he claimed he was,"" says Tobias Harris, author of ""The Iconoclast"", a biography of Mr Abe to be published later this year. Instead, he has appeared hapless and out of touch, much as he did during his brief first stint as pm in 2006-07, when Japanese media pilloried him as kuukiyomenai, or ""one who cannot read the air"", says Jeff Kingston of Temple University in Tokyo.
A scheme to send each Japanese household two cloth masks, at a cost of ¥47bn ($436m) to taxpayers, generated scorn. Detractors dubbed the programme ""Abenomasks"", a play on ""Abenomics"". When the masks started to arrive, many were dirty and defective and, for most people, too small; entire regions have yet to receive any.

Voters are unimpressed by the prime minister's handling of covid-19
Since japan recorded its first case of covid-19 on January 16th, 784 people have died across the country of 126m, fewer deaths than in one day in New York City during the peak of the outbreak there. On May 14th the government lifted the state of emergency in 39 of Japan's 47 prefectures, with more likely to be released this week. In terms of deaths relative to population, Japan ranks alongside South Korea, whose government has been widely praised for its management of the pandemic.
Yet when it comes to public opinion, Abe Shinzo, Japan's prime minister, has been one of a small handful of world leaders to see his approval ratings drop, alongside covid-deniers like Brazil's Jair Bolsonaro. Polls show that more than half of the Japanese public disapproves of the government's handling of the virus. Limited testing, shortages of protective gear for medical workers, the botched handling of a super-spreading cruise ship and hesitation to impose a state of emergency have fuelled frustration and distrust. ""Citizens and the private sector were far ahead of the government,"" says Nakabayashi Mieko, a former opposition mp. On May 19th Japan's national broadcaster, nhk, found that more people disapproved than approved of Mr Abe's government (see chart).
Mr Abe has cultivated the image of himself as a strong leader. But faced with covid-19 ""he has not acted like the leader he claimed he was,"" says Tobias Harris, author of ""The Iconoclast"", a biography of Mr Abe to be published later this year. Instead, he has appeared hapless and out of touch, much as he did during his brief first stint as pm in 2006-07, when Japanese media pilloried him as kuukiyomenai, or ""one who cannot read the air"", says Jeff Kingston of Temple University in Tokyo.
A scheme to send each Japanese household two cloth masks, at a cost of ¥47bn ($436m) to taxpayers, generated scorn. Detractors dubbed the programme ""Abenomasks"", a play on ""Abenomics"". When the masks started to arrive, many were dirty and defective and, for most people, too small; entire regions have yet to receive any. ""Is that really public policy?"" asks Sone Yasunori of Keio University.
The government's economic stimulus measures have been similarly ham-fisted. Mr Abe backtracked on an initial plan to give struggling households ¥300,000 each, shifting instead to a universal ¥100,000 handout favoured by his Liberal Democratic Party's coalition partner, Komeito.

America's response to covid-19 reflects its strengths and weaknesses
In absolute terms, America has been the country worst affected by the coronavirus pandemic. Nearly 1.7m of its inhabitants have been infected, a number which is still growing by around 20,000 every day. On May 27th the country passed its 100,000th confirmed death. Such official death tolls do not necessarily capture all of the lost, and the real tolls in some other countries may be much higher than they seem. But America's official figure is more than 20 times that, say, of China, the country where the disease originated. China is unlikely to have managed to hush up 95% of its deaths.
In most countries such a national tragedy would bring with it a wave of unity. And in many places across America that is what has been seen. All sorts of communities have been suffused by a spirit of mutual aid. People have stopped their ordinary lives to flatten the infection curve, pooled cash to feed unemployed restaurant workers, clapped and banged on pots nightly to celebrate health workers, and held drive-in church services for socially isolated spiritual succour.
On the national stage, though, no such luck. President Donald Trump has done little if anything to bring the nation together or to provide effective leadership to the government's executive branch. He has used the exceptionally prominent bully pulpit he engineered through daily primetime press briefings to spread confusion, misinformation and folly.
To get beyond the spectacle of Mr Trump's shortcomings, and the hatred and disdain with which all his actions are greeted in some quarters, requires seeing America's experience of the epidemic for what it is: highly uneven geographically; disproportionately harmful to some minorities; but, in terms of its death rate, not as yet particularly bad when compared with many countries in Europe.
There were a number of structural reasons to imagine that America would be hit particularly hard by an epidemic such as this. Its health infrastructure is set up principally to maximise profits, and such a system's incentives are not well aligned with pandemic preparedness. One cannot bill an insurer for surge-capacity ventilators, let alone spare intensive-care beds, for specialists in infectious diseases whose expensively acquired expertise is not normally needed or for stockpiles of personal protective equipment (ppe).
The health-insurance system is patchy and expensive, leaving many Americans with too little or no coverage. Researchers speculate that African-Americans may have had a particularly deadly experience of the virus in part because, being less likely to have adequate insurance than their fellow citizens, they tended to seek treatment later in the course of their disease, which typically leads to worse outcomes.
America, like China, has a younger pop- ulation than Europe's. Other things being equal, that should have helped. But other things were not equal. Americans have high levels of conditions that make the virus more lethal, such as diabetes, hypertension and obesity. Roughly 11% of Americans are diabetic, compared with 5% in Italy or France; more than one-third of adults are obese, compared with less than a quarter in Germany. The burden of cardiovascular and respiratory disease in America is substantially higher than it is in western European countries.
Different in many ways
Despite all this, the statistics to date do not show America doing particularly badly. As of May 27th it had seen 301 deaths per million citizens. The 27 countries of the eu have between them seen a death toll of 125,000; 279 deaths per million people. But seven eu countries (including Belgium, France, Italy, the Netherlands and Spain) currently rank above America in their mortality rate. So does Britain, where the official rate is a shocking 559 per million. America thus looks to have fared better, so far, than most major European states, despite significant structural disadvantages when it comes to its people's health and the system meant to maintain it.
Against this, though, should be counted two other factors. The first is that America is less densely populated than Europe, and much less densely populated than the western European states that have been very badly hit. The pandemic has in general been worse in densely populated places. The parts of America which have been worst hit are those with western European population densities (see chart 1).
The second is that the infection began to spread in at least some parts of Europe significantly earlier than it did in America. Italy passed the 100-confirmed-deaths milestone on March 4th, almost two weeks before America did; South Korea had logged 3,000 cases before America's first death was reported. There was thus a short grace period during which America might have shored up its response.
Current evidence suggests that the best thing to have done with that time would have been to get into lockdown sooner. Researchers at Columbia University have estimated that if America had implemented its social-distancing measures just one week earlier it could have reduced nationwide infections by 62% and deaths by 55%.
In America's federal system the timing of shelter-in-place orders and other population-wide measures aimed at stopping the spread of the virus was always going to be a matter for states and cities. Those that went earlier can now be seen, in general, to have done better. A team of economists studying the differences in timing of shelter-in-place orders among states found that the average effect of social-distancing orders in America was to reduce caseloads by 44% within three weeks-with better results for high-population-density states.
The divergence between the East and West Coasts of the country shows the difference vividly. Seattle and San Francisco were early hotspots but shut down fast- which seems likely to be part of the reason that they avoided a meltdown like New York's, where the unwillingness of Bill de Blasio, the mayor of New York City, to adhere to the advice of his public-health agency may have lost valuable time. San Francisco has seen just 40 deaths, compared with New York's 21,000.
Some states might have shut down earlier had they had enough testing capacity to properly evaluate the spread of the virus. Alas the Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (cdc) botched the manufacturing of the test for the virus that it had created in January. Its failure might have been made good, at least to some extent, by private industry. But the Food and Drug Administration (fda) was unwilling to license their efforts. Thus much of the head start which might have made America safer was lost.
Special in some sort of way
This was not Mr Trump's fault. He did not set the timing of the lockdowns, sabotage the cdc or fetter the private labs. But that does not exonerate him. His public statements in the early stage of the pandemic sought to minimise the threat that it posed to America well after scientific advice was making it clear that it would hit America hard. A clear, realistic warning from the White House might have concentrated the minds of state governments. And the jostling with the fda could have been avoided had Mr Trump's administration banged agency heads together and insisted on a coordinated, purposeful response.
America's public-health services are a remarkable resource in terms of brainpower, analytic capability and experience, but they are also numerous and disparate. There are at least a dozen federal ones; local agencies number in the thousands. During the Ebola crisis of 2014 President Barack Obama appointed a tsar to keep the various necessary efforts aligned with one another. Mr Trump has done nothing similar. Nor does he feel he should have. On March 13th, when talking about the failure to get a serious testing infrastructure in place early on, he said, ""I don't take responsibility at all.""
There was no wartime management of the supply chains for testing reagents, swabs and other needed kit. Rather than acting as a co-ordinator, the federal government encouraged an internecine competition between states for ppe and ventilators. A federal agency outbid the commonwealth of Massachusetts for 3m medical-grade face masks, dramatically seizing them after they had been delivered to a New York port. Larry Hogan, the Republican governor of Maryland, was so worried about the federal government muscling in on an order of 500,000 testing kits from South Korea that state police spirited them away to a secret location straight from Baltimore airport.
In assessing this friction, it is worth having a look at the fortunes of two other federated republics during the pandemic (see chart 2). In Brazil Jair Bolsonaro, the president, thinks that containing covid-19, which he once likened to ""sniffles"", is not worth the economic cost (see Americas section). He has tried, unsuccessfully, to prevent some states from locking down. When tasked with enforcing those lockdowns which have gone ahead, the police, who are generally sympathetic to the president, have been dilatory. Brazil's death toll has been climbing steeply.
Germany provides a counter-example. Its states quickly set the country's many private labs to work on testing; this wealth of testing capacity in the early stages of the epidemic allowed local public-health officials to trace contacts and close hotspots of transmission. Angela Merkel, the chancellor, clearly communicated the risks to the public. She and the heads of Germany's states collectively agreed to shutter the economy just a day after the country had recorded its tenth death.
The degree to which Mr Trump's denial of the problem and lack of engagement with the response made America's epidemic worse is unknowable. But it is hard not to imagine that the country might have been better served by an approach more like Mrs Merkel's. Germany's overall death rate has remained considerably lower than that of other comparable European countries; it is one-third that of America's.
In one area, though, Mr Trump's mere presence has been integral to America's outperformance of comparable countries, indeed of any countries: stimulus spending. The states' actions have hit America's economy hard. The official unemployment rate, 3.5% in February, was 14.7% in April. Almost 40m Americans have now filed for unemployment during the epidemic, roughly a quarter of the pre-crisis labour force. ""Absent a historically unprecedented burst of hiring, the unemployment rate could remain in double digits [until some time in] 2021,"" economists from the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco recently concluded.
The federal response to this incipient depression has been remarkably generous. Congress has provided ample unemployment benefits and a grant-and-loan scheme for big and small businesses. Its fiscal stimulus has so far amounted to something like 14% of gdp-higher than most European countries. Of the $9trn the imf estimates to have been spent on fiscal stimulus globally, $2.8trn has been American. There has been a one-time grant of $1,200 to most Americans and a temporary $600 boost to weekly unemployment benefits, which means many of those laid off will be receiving more than they did in work until payments sink back to where they were on July 31st.
Nothing works for everybody
There have been difficulties in getting some of this money out fast enough-state unemployment offices had few staff and run on antiquated software-and gaps in provision remain. Since the start of the crisis, food banks have distributed nearly 1bn meals, 20% more than usual. A recent survey found that more than one in six young children were not eating enough because of their parents' loss of income. But there is more money in the hands of the unemployed than there might have been.
To get a sense of the counterfactual, compare the prompt generosity of this year's action to what Congress provided in the wake of the financial crisis of 2007-09: $840bn. The difference is nothing that Mr Trump has done-co-ordination with Congress has been the treasury secretary's task-but the simple fact of his electionyear incumbency. Republican lawmakers are much more willing to loosen the purse strings under Mr Trump, not least because of the effect of the economy on his election prospects, than they were under Mr Obama. Had covid-19 struck late in President Hillary Clinton's first term, rather than Mr Trump's, it is a fair bet that there would have been similar hostility this time round, too.
Spending may ease the pain; but many states are nevertheless reopening businesses and easing restrictions on work and social gatherings. Thirsty patrons are snaking around the block to get into reopened bars in Dallas; vacationers at Missouri's Lake of the Ozarks filled up swimming pools over the holiday weekend.
Again, it is the states which are doing this, not Mr Trump-despite his various at- tempts to undermine the shelter-in-place orders while they were in force. But the politics of Mr Trump's presidency are a key part of how things have unfurled.
This is because the geographical underpinnings of covid-19 epidemiology and electoral politics are correlated. Low population density predicts both a low covid-19 death rate and a propensity for supporting the Republican Party. Places where Mr Trump has the most support tend to have atypically low experience of the medical effects of the epidemic (see chart 3 on previous page). Recent polling by YouGov has found that only 9% of Republicans have had a family member, friend or acquaintance die of covid-19, compared with 15% of Democrats. Many Republicans in sparsely populated areas feel entirely justified in their exasperation with blanket stay-athome orders.
But the partisan divide on reopening is not just a matter of population density. Researchers at Stanford, Harvard and nyu, armed with location data from mobile phones, have found that throughout lockdown Republicans have been less likely to adhere to social-distancing orders than Democrats, even when living in places with similar levels of infection and similar official constraints on activity. This is in line with research by The Economist on movement during lockdown in America and elsewhere (see chart 4).
The tyranny of the blood test
The right-wing media, which give their audiences a sense that lockdowns, maskwearing and calls for greater testing are weak-willed coastal liberalism, have also played a role. Economists estimating the causal effect of watching Fox News, the television channel in closest alignment to the views of the president, find that it may have persuaded one-third of its viewers not to comply with stay-at-home orders. Nearly 4m Americans watch the network's prime-time opinion shows each night.
America is not an outlier in the fact of its reopening; the same is happening in western Europe. But there is a crucial difference. European reopenings have been preceded by clear indications that the rate of infection was falling. The same is not true for all of America.
An epidemiological analysis published by researchers at Imperial College London, found that, as of May 17th, ""the epidemic [was] not under control in much of the us"". In 24 states the number of further cases to be expected as a result of each new case remained above one. The situation has improved since then, but not by leaps and bounds. New York and surrounding hard hit states are showing declining levels of infection. In other states, such as Alabama and Mississippi, infection rates do not appear to be under control, perhaps because their lockdowns were not that well observed. Outside New York, New Jersey and Connecticut, hospitalisation rates have not changed since the start of May.
Part of the point of a sustained lockdown is to take the time it buys to build the capacity to deal with later recurrences with well-thought-through and resourced testing and contact-tracing programmes. These are not in place nationwide. ""We had time to develop these capabilities that required a national co-ordinated effort, and we have not used this time,"" says Leana Wen, a former health commissioner of Baltimore. ""And I'm afraid that as a result, the sacrifices that people have made are in vain."" Anthony Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases since 1984, testified before the Senate that, should states skip guidelines and open prematurely, ""There is a real risk that you will trigger an outbreak that you may not be able to control."" Local spikes in new cases, if they go unnoticed, will allow community spread to re-establish itself.
Experts have recommended that a disease-surveillance scheme up to the task of nipping such recurrences in the bud would require testing rates of at least 1m per day. Some want a rate double or triple that. But today's rate is reported to be less than half the desideratum-about 400,000-and that is probably an overstatement. Some states are juicing their numbers by reporting the results of antibody tests (which reveal that someone has had the disease) alongside diagnostic tests (which reveal current infections), an apples-for-oranges mistake.
In spite of this, as far back as May 11th a barefaced Mr Trump triumphantly told a Rose Garden of mask-wearing journalists that the testing mission was accomplished: ""We have met the moment and we have prevailed."" If that is by happy chance the case, it is no thanks to Mr Trump. But re-openings which feel premature after lockdowns which were sketchily observed suggest it may not be the case at all. There may be more sad records yet to be set.","WASHINGTON , DC

A recent survey found that more than one in six young children were not eating enough because of their parents ' loss of income . But there is more money in the hands of the unemployed than there might have been . 
 To get a sense of the counterfactual , compare the prompt generosity of this year 's action to what Congress provided in the wake of the financial crisis of 2007 - 09 : $ 840bn . The difference is nothing that Mr Trump has done - co - ordination with Congress has been the treasury secretary 's task - but the simple fact of his electionyear incumbency . Republican lawmakers are much more willing to loosen the purse strings under Mr Trump , not least because of the effect of the economy on his election prospects , than they were under Mr Obama . Had covid-19 struck late in President Hillary Clinton 's first term , rather than Mr Trump 's , it is a fair bet that there would have been similar hostility this time round , too . 
 Spending may ease the pain ; but many states are nevertheless reopening businesses and easing restrictions on work and social gatherings . Thirsty patrons are snaking around the block to get into reopened bars in Dallas ; vacationers at Missouri 's Lake of the Ozarks filled up swimming pools over the holiday weekend . 
 Again , it is the states which are doing this , not Mr Trump - despite his various at- tempts to undermine the shelter - in - place orders while they were in force . But the politics of Mr Trump 's presidency are a key part of how things have unfurled . 
 This is because the geographical underpinnings of covid-19 epidemiology and electoral politics are correlated . Low population density predicts both a low covid-19 death rate and a propensity for supporting the Republican Party . Places where Mr Trump has the most support tend to have atypically low experience of the medical effects of the epidemic ( see chart 3 on previous page ) . Recent polling by YouGov has found that only 9 % of Republicans have had a family member , friend or acquaintance die of covid-19 , compared with 15 % of Democrats . Many Republicans in sparsely populated areas feel entirely justified in their exasperation with blanket stay - athome orders . 
 But the partisan divide on reopening is not just a matter of population density . Researchers at Stanford , Harvard and nyu , armed with location data from mobile phones , have found that throughout lockdown Republicans have been less likely to adhere to social - distancing orders than Democrats , even when living in places with similar levels of infection and similar official constraints on activity . This is in line with research by The Economist on movement during lockdown in America and elsewhere ( see chart 4 ) . 
 The tyranny of the blood test 
 The right - wing media , which give their audiences a sense that lockdowns , maskwearing and calls for greater testing are weak - willed coastal liberalism , have also played a role . Economists estimating the causal effect of watching Fox News , the television channel in closest alignment to the views of Jair Bolsonaro , find that it may have persuaded one - third of its viewers not to comply with stay - at - home orders . Nearly 4 m Americans watch the network 's prime - time opinion shows each night . 
 America is not an outlier in the fact of its reopening ; the same is happening in western Europe . But there is a crucial difference . European reopenings have been preceded by clear indications that the rate of infection was falling . The same is not true for all of America . 
 An epidemiological analysis published by researchers at Imperial College London , found that , as of May 17th , "" the epidemic [ was ] not under control in much of the us "" . In 24 states the number of further cases to be expected as a result of each new case remained above one . The situation has improved since then , but not by leaps and bounds . New York and surrounding hard hit states are showing declining levels of infection . In other states , such as Alabama and Mississippi , infection rates do not appear to be under control , perhaps because their lockdowns were not that well observed . Outside New York , New Jersey and Connecticut , hospitalisation rates have not changed since the start of May. 
 Part of the point of a sustained lockdown is to take the time it buys to build the capacity to deal with later recurrences with well - thought - through and resourced testing and contact - tracing programmes . These are not in place nationwide . "" We had time to develop these capabilities that required a national co - ordinated effort , and we have not used this time , "" says Leana Wen , a former health commissioner of Baltimore . "" And I 'm afraid that as a result , the sacrifices that people have made are in vain . "" Anthony Fauci , the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases since 1984 , testified before the Senate that , should states skip guidelines and open prematurely , "" There is a real risk that you will trigger an outbreak that you may not be able to control . "" Local spikes in new cases , if they go unnoticed , will allow community spread to re - establish itself . 
 Experts have recommended that a disease - surveillance scheme up to the task of nipping such recurrences in the bud would require testing rates of at least 1 m per day . Some want a rate double or triple that . But today 's rate is reported to be less than half the desideratum - about 400,000 - and that is probably an overstatement . Some states are juicing their numbers by reporting the results of antibody tests ( which reveal that someone has had the disease ) alongside diagnostic tests ( which reveal current infections ) , an apples - for - oranges mistake . 
 In spite of this , as far back as May 11th a barefaced Mr Trump triumphantly told a Rose Garden of mask - wearing journalists that the testing mission was accomplished : "" We have met the moment and we have prevailed . "" If that is by happy chance the case , it is no thanks to Mr Trump . But re - openings which feel premature after lockdowns which were sketchily observed suggest it may not be the case at all . There may be more sad records yet to be set .",140,Brazil,ctb-140-2,IN TERM,True,"Jair Bolsonaro , the president",5,True

SĂO PAULO
The country entered the pandemic with some advantages. Because of Jair Bolsonaro it is squandering them
On may i8th Bruno Covas, the mayor of Sāo Paulo, Brazil's biggest city, announced an unscheduled five-day holiday to discourage people from going out. The residents of Paraisópolis, a favela of perhaps 100,000 people in southern Sāo Paulo, where covid-19 deaths are rising at a faster rate than anywhere else in the city, saw the festive side. A popcorn vendor set up shop to serve the stream of patients entering a clinic. School-aged boys flew kites nearby. ""Brazil adapted well to this new reality,"" joked one, pointing to crowded rooftops and the dancing diamonds overhead.
Brazil's covid-19 curve looks like a kite string. On May 28th it had 411,821 confirmed cases and 25,598 deaths. The United States, the only country with more cases, barred Brazilians from entering from May 26th. The World Health Organisation has declared South America ""a new epicentre"", with Brazil the worst affected country. A study in 133 cities by the Federal University of Pelotas in the southern state of Rio Grande do Sul concluded that Brazil's caseload is seven times the official number.
Brazil entered the pandemic with strengths. Like the United States it has a federal system. Governors (and mayors) have the power to declare lockdowns. Brazil's free Unified Health System (sus), modelled on Britain's National Health Service, serves 80% of the population, though poorly in some regions. In earlier crises, such as the HİN! (""swine flu"") epidemic in 2009 and the mosquito-borne Zika outbreak in 2015, the three levels of government and the sus co-operated effectively.
More contagious than H1Ni, covid-19 exploits Brazil's weaknesses. Rich travellers brought the virus, but it is now concentrated in poor neighbourhoods like Paraisópolis, where people are packed together and have jobs without contracts or benefits. That makes social distancing hard. A monthly benefit of 600 reais ($110) introduced in April has helped millions of informal workers, but long queues of people unable to obtain it are still forming at banks.
What makes social distancing harder is that Brazil's populist president, Jair Bolsonaro, scoffs at the medical establishment and its advice. He has quarrelled with and lost two health ministers since the crisis began. His attitude to covid-19 resembles that of President Donald Trump: both tout hydroxychloroquine, a malaria drug that is useless against covid-19 and can be dangerous, according to a new study in the Lancet.
Mr Bolsonaro's attitude causes more damage, however. Brazil's federal system is more president-centred than America's. To work well in a crisis, all levels of government must co-operate. Luiz Henrique Mandetta, Brazil's health minister when the outbreak began, held daily meetings with state and municipal health secretaries to plan for getting and distributing money, tests and equipment to combat the pandemic. But after Mr Bolsonaro sacked him 1 · on April 16th those meetings ended. ""The sus is a three-legged animal,"" Mr Mandetta says. ""If you cut off one of its legs, it starts to go in circles.""
Rich states with relatively strong health systems are coping better. In the state of Sāo Paulo co-ordination among municipal and state health agencies and the private sector helped open thousands of hospital beds, including in stadiums and convention centres. Even so, in the city more than 90% of intensive-care beds are occupied. Douglas Cardozo, an auxiliary nurse at Hospital do Campo Limpo, south of Paraisópolis, says that staff lack bodysuits and other necessities. At least 50 patients a day check in with covid-19 symptoms, he says. Two colleagues have died from it.
In poorer regions of Brazil the health system is buckling. Less than a month after the first covid case was reported on March 13th in Manaus, a city of 2m in the Amazon rainforest, the mayor said that its system had collapsed. A promised field hospital has failed to materialise and mass graves are being dug for victims, some of whom are dying on boats en route to the city.
The weaker the health system, the more it needs the protection of strict lockdowns. But Mr Bolsonaro has made these a wedge issue. He shows up at weekly protests in Brasilia, the capital, against quarantines. Unlike in some European countries, Brazilians do not come to their front doors and windows to applaud health workers. Their covid clamour signals conflict. When Mr Bolsonaro says something incendiary, his fans drive around blasting car horns in approval while his critics bang pots and pans. In municipalities where support for Mr Bolsonaro is strong, adherence to social distancing is correspondingly weak, according to a recent paper by Nicolas Ajzenman, an economist, and two other authors.
This forces governors and mayors to fight on several fronts. Mr Bolsonaro mounted a legal challenge to their quarantine orders, which the Supreme Court rejected on April 15th. Joāo Doria, the centreright governor of Sāo Paulo state, says that to implement a strict lockdown ""would mean a clear confrontation with millions of Brazilians"" who support Mr Bolsonaro. (Critics say he wants to avoid angering businessfolk.) Some Brazilians are merely confused. They ask themselves: ""whom should I listen to, the governor or the president?"" says Mr Doria.
This adds to the economic and cultural forces that jam people together even as the president divides them. Just half in Sāo Paulo are adhering to lockdown rules. To stop the virus's spread 70% is needed, says the state's government. On bustling Avenida Senador Teotônio Vilela on the city's southern periphery more than 20 shoppers browse in a variety store, ducking in and out under half-lowered metal shutters. Reinildo Carneiro, a construction worker, donned a puppy-print mask and popped into a bar in Paraisópolis for a game of snooker. ""You're more vulnerable if you get depressed from staying at home,"" he says. Beer kills the virus, he read on WhatsApp.
Mr Bolsonaro will not set him straight. His presidency is consumed by melodrama. In a two-hour video of a cabinet meeting released by the country's Supreme Court and watched by millions of Brazilians, he gave himself over to unhinged and profanity-filled rants against police investigations of his sons but had little to say about protecting citizens from the pandemic. Widespread testing, a precondition for easing lockdowns safely, is not happening. By May 26th Brazil had processed fewer than 500,000 tests, just a tenth of the number acquired by the health ministry. Its testing rate is far lower than that of European countries and the United States.
Governors are yielding to pressure anyway. On May 27th Mr Doria announced plans to open parts of his state, though not the city of Sāo Paulo. At the city's Sāo Luis cemetery 3,000 fresh graves await covid-19 victims. Several hundred have been filled. The cemetery's old average of 11 burials a day has jumped to more than 40, says a gravedigger. Most graves are covered with flowers but unmarked due to a backlog in engraving the plaques. A banner warns about Zika. None is needed for covid-19, says the gravedigger. ""Once people lose a family member, they finally believe."" -","Brazil

Why conservatives are more likely than liberals to fall prey to misinformation
octors need three qualifications: to JDbe able to lie and not get caught; to pretend to be honest; and to cause death without guilt. So wrote Jean Froissart, a diarist of the Middle Ages, after an outbreak of bubonic plague in the 14th century. Fake news then meant rumours that the plague could be cured by sitting in a sewer, eating decade-old treacle or ingesting arsenic.
The ""infodemic around covid-19, declared by the World Health Organisation (who) in February, is not the world's first outbreak of misinformation. This time the myths include the notion that the disease can be cured by drinking methanol, which has led to more than 700 deaths in Iran, and that it is spread by 5G transmitters, which has convinced arsonists in Britain to carry out more than 90 attacks on phone towers. Just as the virus lodges in people's lungs, dangerous ideas are infecting their minds.
One big difference between the infodemics of the 1300s and 2020 is the rapid worldwide transmission of today's nonsense, enabled by the internet. In March a poll by Gallup of 28 countries in four continents found that in all of them, at least 16%-and as many as 58%-of people thought covid-19 was being deliberately spread (see chart 1). A clip of a film called ""Plandemic , which claims that a shadowy elite started the outbreak for profit, was uploaded on May 4th; within a week it had been seen 8m times and its star, Judy Mikovits, had topped Amazon's bestseller list.
Social media enable people to share true news as well as the fake sort. But the fabulists seem to be winning. A study published in Nature in May found that, although provaccine Facebook users outnumber antivaccine ones, the anti-vaxxers are better at forging links with non-aligned groups like school parents' associations, so their number is growing faster. Among Americans, exposure to social media is associated with a greater likelihood of believing that the government created the virus or that officials exaggerate its seriousness, according to a recent paper in the Harvard Kennedy School's Misinformation Review.
Broadcasters in many countries need a licence and must convince regulators that they try to report the news truthfully. Few such constraints apply to the internet. In April Britain's broadcasting watchdog, Ofcom, censured a tiny tv station called London Live for airing part of an interview with David Icke, a conspiracy theorist who believes the pandemic is a hoax. The broadcast had been watched by only 80,000 people. Yet at the time of Ofcom's ruling 6m had viewed the full interview on YouTube, which is outside Ofcom's jurisdiction.
YouTube has since taken the video down, along with many others. Section 230 of America's Communications Decency Act absolves tech firms of responsibility in that country for fact-checking uploaded content. But President Donald Trump wants to change this (see next story). Even if he is blocked by the courts, public opinion favours more intervention. In America 84% say social networks should delete posts that they suspect contain inaccurate information about covid-19. Half that number say they should do so without confirming the posts are false. Tech firms have thus begun to add warnings to false information and signposts to reliable sources.
Covid-19 may seem a relatively straight- forward subject on which to play censor. Compared with, say, politics, ""it's easier to set policies that are a little more black and white and take a much harder line, Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook's boss, told the New York Times in March. Yet it is proving tricky. The science is changing rapidly. In February America's surgeon-general tweeted that facemasks were ""NOT effective in preventing general public from catching coronavirus . Now he says they are.
Worse, any hope that the pandemic would be politically uncontentious has evaporated. In March Mr Zuckerberg said Facebook had no problem taking down ""things like 'You can cure this by drinking bleach.' I mean, that's just in a different class . Yet weeks later Mr Trump suggested it might help to inject disinfectant. Facebook, Twitter and YouTube have removed videos posted by Brazil's president, Jair Bolsonaro, declaring hydroxychloroquine an effective treatment. So far clips of Mr Trump praising (and even claiming to take) ""the hydroxy remain up. The firms say the difference is that Mr Trump stopped short of saying that the drug was a proven cure.
Left v right v wrong
Just as misinformation is not new, nor is its political use. In 1964 an essay by a historian, Richard Hofstadter, on the ""paranoid style in American politics described ""the sense of heated exaggeration, suspiciousness, and conspiratorial fantasy running through everything from 18th-century protests against the Illuminati to the antiMasonic movement. Yet whereas Hofstadter argued that the paranoid style came as easily to those on the left as on the right- for instance, he cited the rumours of a slave-owners' plot that were propagated by some abolitionists-today's infodemic appears to be spreading more easily among the world's conservatives than its liberals.
In America the Pew Research Centre found in March that 30% of Republicans believed the virus was created intentionally, nearly twice the share of Democrats. Last month a poll by YouGov found that 44% of Republicans think Bill Gates wants to use covid-19 vaccines to implant microchips in people; 19% of Democrats agree. In France a poll by Ifop found that 40% of those who support Marine Le Pen's National Rally (once the National Front) believed that the virus was made by design, twice the share among backers of the far-left Unsubmissive France party. Supporters of the Dutch right-populist Freedom Party and the Forum for Democracy (fvd) are 40% more likely than backers of the far-left Socialist Party to say covid-19 is a biological weapon.
Wilder conspiracy theories aside, conservatives also seem more likely than liberals to question the official line on the pandemic. In late March, with Britain freshly locked down, a quarter of Tories but only 15% of Labour supporters believed that covid-19 was ""just like the flu .
The reluctance of so many conservatives to believe the conventional narrative of covid-19 is part of a more general suspicion of mainstream sources of information in some places. In America there is a yawning partisan gap in trust (see chart 2). The widest gulf concerns journalists, the next academics. These professions have long been conservative targets. Rush Limbaugh, an American talk-show host, speaks of the ""four corners of deceit : the media, scientists, academia and the government.
Such language is echoed by European populists of the right. Thierry Baudet, leader of the fvd, declared last year that ""we're being destroyed by the people who should protect us and undermined by our universities, by our journalists. He has set up a ""hotline to report left-wing academics, and scoffs that the Dutch public broadcaster ""obediently nods for the powers that be . In France Ms Le Pen claims that ""the government has been the biggest provider of fake news since the start of this [covid] crisis. And in Britain, Brexiteers have questioned the impartiality of journalists, academics and civil servants, their attitude summed up by then justice secretary Michael Gove's remark that people ""have had enough of experts from organisations with acronyms saying that they know what is best and getting it consistently wrong . British Conservatives have less faith than others in most of the media, as well as in international institutions. In April an Opinium poll found they were twice as likely as Labour voters to mistrust Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, the head of the who.
Elite-bashing is hardly unique to conservatives. Andr s Manuel L pez Obrador, Mexico's populist left-wing president, continually lays into the media. So did Labour's former leader, Jeremy Corbyn, who talked darkly about an ""establishment that mysteriously kept causing him to lose elections. Democrats are likelier than Republicans to believe that 9/11 was an inside job. And the left is partial to corporate conspiracies, including the myth that aids was invented by Big Pharma and the cia. One prominent peddler of covid-19 myths, according to NewsGuard, which vets sites for accuracy, is @OrganicLife, whose tweets combine vegan nut-milk recipes with paranoia about 5G transmitters.
Conspiracy beliefs are associated with ideological extremism of any variety, argues Karen Douglas, an expert on conspiracy theories at the University of Kent. Yet she says there is an ""asymmetry . People on the right believe in them more often, and entertain a broader range of theories, particularly those that accuse the other ""side of plotting, whether that be left-wingers, foreigners or other groups.
Structural shifts may explain why conservative voters seem to be more prone to the infodemic, and why conservative leaders have more reason-and are more likely-to undermine reliable sources. For one thing, conservatives' complaints that elites are not on their side have become more plausible. In many countries the old leftright political divide, based on economics, has been replaced by a liberal-conservative split, based on culture. This largely pits liberal graduates against conservative schoolleavers. And elites-whether in the media, the civil service, science or academia-are dominated by graduates. This doesn't necessarily make them partial. But when Brexiteers complain that the civil service is a nest of Remainers, or Republicans growl that America's universities are stuffed with liberals, they are right. 1
Conservatives have responded by tuning in to their own media sources, which have found that there is money to be made in amplifying their fears. American talk-radio punctuates paranoid chat with ads for dubious health remedies (Alex Jones, a Texas-based radio host, was recently ordered to stop selling toothpaste which he claimed ""kills the whole SARS-corona family at point-blank range ). Cable channels such as Fox News and websites like Breitbart have drawn audiences by bringing fringe theories into the mainstream.
Most recently, social networks' algorithms have steered people towards polarising content, which is more likely to provoke ""engagement and thus generate ad impressions. In 2018 an internal report at Facebook warned that users were being pointed to divisive material. Yet plans to highlight less controversial posts-a project dubbed ""Eat Your Veggies -were sidelined, partly because of concerns that the changes would affect conservative users more than others, according to the Wall Street Journal. Some 16% of Americans get their covid-19 news directly from the White House; three-quarters of those who do so think the media have exaggerated the seriousness of the pandemic.
Another cause of conservative mistrust is that, in some countries, the electoral system gives conservative politicians a particular incentive to encourage polarisation. Liberals tend to be concentrated in cities; conservatives are more spread out. In winner-takes-all systems, this puts liberal parties at a disadvantage, as they pile up huge majorities in cities while conservative parties win more seats by lower margins elsewhere. In America this means the Republicans can win the electoral college with a minority of the popular vote (as they did in 2000 and 2016). In Britain it means Brexit supporters are in the majority in nearly two-thirds of constituencies but make up only about half of voters. The upshot, argues Ezra Klein in a new book on America, ""Why We're Polarised , is that ultra-partisanship works better for conservatives. Liberals have to win votes from moderates; conservatives can prevail by just getting out their base. As politics becomes more polarised, energising the base gets easier, and winning over moderates harder.
The lessons from history are gloomy. Hofstadter believed that political paranoia ""may be a persistent psychic phenomenon, more or less constantly affecting a modest minority of the population. But, he warned, ""certain historical catastrophes or frustrations may be conducive to the release of such psychic energies, and to situations in which they can more readily be built into mass movements or political parties. Like the Iraq war and the global financial crisis, the pandemic may prove to be exactly that kind of catastrophe.","Fake news

A clip of a film called ""Plandemic , which claims that a shadowy elite started the outbreak for profit, was uploaded on May 4th; within a week it had been seen 8m times and its star, Judy Mikovits, had topped Amazon's bestseller list.
Social media enable people to share true news as well as the fake sort. But the fabulists seem to be winning. A study published in Nature in May found that, although provaccine Facebook users outnumber antivaccine ones, the anti-vaxxers are better at forging links with non-aligned groups like school parents' associations, so their number is growing faster. Among Americans, exposure to social media is associated with a greater likelihood of believing that the government created the virus or that officials exaggerate its seriousness, according to a recent paper in the Harvard Kennedy School's Misinformation Review.
Broadcasters in many countries need a licence and must convince regulators that they try to report the news truthfully. Few such constraints apply to the internet. In April Britain's broadcasting watchdog, Ofcom, censured a tiny tv station called London Live for airing part of an interview with David Icke, a conspiracy theorist who believes the pandemic is a hoax. The broadcast had been watched by only 80,000 people. Yet at the time of Ofcom's ruling 6m had viewed the full interview on YouTube, which is outside Ofcom's jurisdiction.
YouTube has since taken the video down, along with many others. Section 230 of America's Communications Decency Act absolves tech firms of responsibility in that country for fact-checking uploaded content. But President Donald Trump wants to change this (see next story). Even if he is blocked by the courts, public opinion favours more intervention. In America 84% say social networks should delete posts that they suspect contain inaccurate information about covid-19. Half that number say they should do so without confirming the posts are false. Tech firms have thus begun to add warnings to false information and signposts to reliable sources.
Covid-19 may seem a relatively straight- forward subject on which to play censor. Compared with, say, politics, ""it's easier to set policies that are a little more black and white and take a much harder line, Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook's boss, told the New York Times in March. Yet it is proving tricky. The science is changing rapidly. In February America's surgeon-general tweeted that facemasks were ""NOT effective in preventing general public from catching coronavirus . Now he says they are.
Worse, any hope that the pandemic would be politically uncontentious has evaporated. In March Mr Zuckerberg said Facebook had no problem taking down ""things like 'You can cure this by drinking bleach.' I mean, that's just in a different class . Yet weeks later Mr Trump suggested it might help to inject disinfectant. Facebook, Twitter and YouTube have removed videos posted by Brazil's president, Jair Bolsonaro, declaring hydroxychloroquine an effective treatment. So far clips of Mr Trump praising (and even claiming to take) ""the hydroxy remain up. The firms say the difference is that Mr Trump stopped short of saying that the drug was a proven cure.
Left v right v wrong
Just as misinformation is not new, nor is its political use. In 1964 an essay by a historian, Richard Hofstadter, on the ""paranoid style in American politics described ""the sense of heated exaggeration, suspiciousness, and conspiratorial fantasy running through everything from 18th-century protests against the Illuminati to the antiMasonic movement. Yet whereas Hofstadter argued that the paranoid style came as easily to those on the left as on the right- for instance, he cited the rumours of a slave-owners' plot that were propagated by some abolitionists-today's infodemic appears to be spreading more easily among the world's conservatives than its liberals.
In America the Pew Research Centre found in March that 30% of Republicans believed the virus was created intentionally, nearly twice the share of Democrats. Last month a poll by YouGov found that 44% of Republicans think Bill Gates wants to use covid-19 vaccines to implant microchips in people; 19% of Democrats agree. In France a poll by Ifop found that 40% of those who support Marine Le Pen's National Rally (once the National Front) believed that the virus was made by design, twice the share among backers of the far-left Unsubmissive France party. Supporters of the Dutch right-populist Freedom Party and the Forum for Democracy (fvd) are 40% more likely than backers of the far-left Socialist Party to say covid-19 is a biological weapon.
Wilder conspiracy theories aside, conservatives also seem more likely than liberals to question the official line on the pandemic. In late March, with Britain freshly locked down, a quarter of Tories but only 15% of Labour supporters believed that covid-19 was ""just like the flu .
The reluctance of so many conservatives to believe the conventional narrative of covid-19 is part of a more general suspicion of mainstream sources of information in some places. In America there is a yawning partisan gap in trust (see chart 2). The widest gulf concerns journalists, the next academics. These professions have long been conservative targets. Rush Limbaugh, an American talk-show host, speaks of the ""four corners of deceit : the media, scientists, academia and the government.
Such language is echoed by European populists of the right. Thierry Baudet, leader of the fvd, declared last year that ""we're being destroyed by the people who should protect us and undermined by our universities, by our journalists. He has set up a ""hotline to report left-wing academics, and scoffs that the Dutch public broadcaster ""obediently nods for the powers that be . In France Ms Le Pen claims that ""the government has been the biggest provider of fake news since the start of this [covid] crisis. And in Britain, Brexiteers have questioned the impartiality of journalists, academics and civil servants, their attitude summed up by then justice secretary Michael Gove's remark that people ""have had enough of experts from organisations with acronyms saying that they know what is best and getting it consistently wrong . British Conservatives have less faith than others in most of the media, as well as in international institutions. In April an Opinium poll found they were twice as likely as Labour voters to mistrust Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, the head of the who.
Elite-bashing is hardly unique to conservatives. Andr s Manuel L pez Obrador, Mexico's populist left-wing president, continually lays into the media. So did Labour's former leader, Jeremy Corbyn, who talked darkly about an ""establishment that mysteriously kept causing him to lose elections. Democrats are likelier than Republicans to believe that 9/11 was an inside job. And the left is partial to corporate conspiracies, including the myth that aids was invented by Big Pharma and the cia. One prominent peddler of covid-19 myths, according to NewsGuard, which vets sites for accuracy, is @OrganicLife, whose tweets combine vegan nut-milk recipes with paranoia about 5G transmitters.
Conspiracy beliefs are associated with ideological extremism of any variety, argues Karen Douglas, an expert on conspiracy theories at the University of Kent. Yet she says there is an ""asymmetry . People on the right believe in them more often, and entertain a broader range of theories, particularly those that accuse the other ""side of plotting, whether that be left-wingers, foreigners or other groups.
Structural shifts may explain why conservative voters seem to be more prone to the infodemic, and why conservative leaders have more reason-and are more likely-to undermine reliable sources. For one thing, conservatives' complaints that elites are not on their side have become more plausible. In many countries the old leftright political divide, based on economics, has been replaced by a liberal-conservative split, based on culture. This largely pits liberal graduates against conservative schoolleavers. And elites-whether in the media, the civil service, science or academia-are dominated by graduates. This doesn't necessarily make them partial. But when Brexiteers complain that the civil service is a nest of Remainers, or Republicans growl that America's universities are stuffed with liberals, they are right. 1
Conservatives have responded by tuning in to their own media sources, which have found that there is money to be made in amplifying their fears. American talk-radio punctuates paranoid chat with ads for dubious health remedies (Alex Jones, a Texas-based radio host, was recently ordered to stop selling toothpaste which he claimed ""kills the whole SARS-corona family at point-blank range ). Cable channels such as Fox News and websites like Breitbart have drawn audiences by bringing fringe theories into the mainstream.
Most recently, social networks' algorithms have steered people towards polarising content, which is more likely to provoke ""engagement and thus generate ad impressions. In 2018 an internal report at Facebook warned that users were being pointed to divisive material. Yet plans to highlight less controversial posts-a project dubbed ""Eat Your Veggies -were sidelined, partly because of concerns that the changes would affect conservative users more than others, according to the Wall Street Journal. Some 16% of Americans get their covid-19 news directly from the White House; three-quarters of those who do so think the media have exaggerated the seriousness of the pandemic.
Another cause of conservative mistrust is that, in some countries, the electoral system gives conservative politicians a particular incentive to encourage polarisation. Liberals tend to be concentrated in cities; conservatives are more spread out. In winner-takes-all systems, this puts liberal parties at a disadvantage, as they pile up huge majorities in cities while conservative parties win more seats by lower margins elsewhere. In America this means the Republicans can win the electoral college with a minority of the popular vote (as they did in 2000 and 2016). In Britain it means Brexit supporters are in the majority in nearly two-thirds of constituencies but make up only about half of voters. The upshot, argues Ezra Klein in a new book on America, ""Why We're Polarised , is that ultra-partisanship works better for conservatives. Liberals have to win votes from moderates; conservatives can prevail by just getting out their base. As politics becomes more polarised, energising the base gets easier, and winning over moderates harder.
The lessons from history are gloomy. Hofstadter believed that political paranoia ""may be a persistent psychic phenomenon, more or less constantly affecting a modest minority of the population. But, he warned, ""certain historical catastrophes or frustrations may be conducive to the release of such psychic energies, and to situations in which they can more readily be built into mass movements or political parties. Like the Iraq war and the global financial crisis, the pandemic may prove to be exactly that kind of catastrophe.",140,Brazil,ctb-140-2,,False,,0,True

MARSEILLE
A controversial doctor exposes fractures in French society
In late march, outside a brand-new medical institute on a busy boulevard in Marseille, a single-file queue snaked along the pavement. Amid a national shortage of covid-19 tests, local residents had heard that the city's Institut Hospitalier Universitaire, linked to the main public hospital, was offering to test anybody with even mild symptoms. Word had also spread that the institute's director, Didier Raoult, was successfully treating patients there with hydroxychloroquine, used to treat malaria, along with an antibiotic. Today, Mr Raoult says coolly that covid-19 has ""almost totally disappeared from Marseille.
A contrarian microbiologist with long druid-like silver hair, Mr Raoult has become a cult figure in France's second-biggest city. A fan tattooed an image of the professor on his arm. A former patient drove a publicity van emblazoned with the doctor's face around the city. L'Olympique de Marseille, the local football club, displayed a banner declaring ""Marseille and the world behind Prof. Raoult!!!
On one level, Marseille's new hero reflects a natural yearning for hope at a time of anguish, and for clarity in the face of scientific uncertainty. Mr Raoult has treated nearly 4,000 patients. His most recent study put those who tested positive for covid-19 on the two-drug cocktail. It reported no deaths among those aged under 74, and said 98.7% were ""cured.
Yet the controversy over Mr Raoult's treatment also exposes deep fractures in French society. The capital's elite ridicules the professor-""a charlatan who thinks he is God, sniffed a philosopher. The Paris medical establishment pours scorn on his results. They are not randomised clinical trials but hospital-based observational studies, lacking a control group. He represents none of the Paris-based French health bodies. As if to confirm his capricious nature, note his critics, Mr Raoult walked out of President Emmanuel Macron's scientific advisory council.
Populists, meanwhile, have claimed him as one of theirs, a sort of gilet jaune in a white coat. He is ""to medicine what we are to politics, declared Jordan Bardella, deputy leader of the National Rally (formerly the National Front). The professor has a serious research record, winning a top prize in part for his discovery of the first giant virus. But Mr Raoult's cocky, consensus-defying self-promotion-he calls himself ""a star of infectious diseases-makes him a poster boy for those drawn to showmanship. Donald Trump and Jair Bolsonaro are fans of his antimalarial drug.
Mindful of this following, Mr Macron flew to Marseille during lockdown to listen to the professor. Three large randomised controlled trials, in Britain, America and Spain, found no benefit from hydroxychloroquine in treating covid-19. The French government, meanwhile, has zigzagged on authorising clinical trials. The Marseillais, however, are undeterred. A poll shows that only 39% of the French have a positive image of Mr Raoult, but in the region around Marseille he scores 60%.","France

SAO PAULO
Big firms don't chop down trees. But their suppliers do
The world's emissions of carbon dioxide may fall by 7% this year because of lockdowns in response to the pandemic, according to Nature Climate Change, a journal. Brazil is a glaring exception. Its emissions will rise by 10-20% from 2018, when they were last measured, says the Climate Observatory, a consortium of research outfits. The culprit is deforestation. In the first four months of 2020 an estimated 1,202 square km (464 square miles) were cleared in the Brazilian Amazon, 55% more than during the same period in 2019, which was the worst year in a decade. Come August, when ranchers set fire to cleared areas to prepare them for grazing, runaway blazes could outnumber those that shocked the world last year. Scientists say tree loss is nearing a ""tipping point, after which trees will dry out and die, releasing billions of tonnes of carbon into the atmosphere.
Environmentalists blame Brazil's populist president, Jair Bolsonaro, for the catastrophe. He favours deregulation to allow logging, mining and farming in the forest and has weakened enforcement of environmental laws. Less attention has been paid to the role of big firms like jbs and Cargill, global intermediaries for beef and soya, the commodities that drive deforestation (see Graphic detail).
The companies do not chop down trees themselves. Rather, they are middlemen in complex supply chains that deal in soya and beef produced on deforested land. The process begins when speculators, who tend to operate outside the law, buy or seize land, sell the timber, graze cattle on it for several years and then sell it to a soya farmer. Land in the Amazon is five to ten times more valuable once it is deforested, says Daniel Nepstad, an ecologist. Not chopping down trees would have a large opportunity cost. In 2009 Mr Nepstad estimated that cost (in terms of forgone beef and soy output) would be $275bn over 30 years, about 16% of that year's gdp.
Under pressure from public opinion, the big firms have made attempts to control the problem. In 2009, a damning report from Greenpeace led jbs, Marfrig and Minerva, meat giants which together handle two-thirds of Brazil's exports, to pledge to stop buying from suppliers that deforest illegally. (The forest code allows owners to clear 20% of their land.) jbs, which sources from an area in the Amazon larger than Germany, says it has blocked 9,000 suppliers, using satellites to detect clearing. Soya traders such as Cargill and Bunge have used such systems to enforce a zero-deforestation agreement for the region since 2008, when retail firms like McDonald's and Tesco said they would no longer buy Amazonian soya harvested on deforested land.
These agreements contributed to a sharp decline in the rate of tree loss until 2012 (see chart on next page). Before the ""soya moratorium, 30% of new fields in the Amazon involved clearing forests. In the eight years after it was signed, 99% of soya expansion was on land that was already treeless. But, warns Andr Vasconcelos from Trase, an ngo that tracks com- modity supply chains, the frenzy of deforestation under Mr Bolsonaro could reverse this trend.
The deforestation surge shows that the agreements have an Achilles' heel, says Mr Nepstad. The big firms are still not exerting the control they could over all their suppliers. And even if they did, large amounts of soya, and especially beef, are traded by smaller firms with weaker incentives to persuade farmers to change behaviour.
The problem is especially acute in ranching, which accounts for roughly 80% of deforestation in the Amazon, nearly all of it illegal. ""Cows move around,"" explains Paulo Pianez of Marfrig. Every fattening farm the big meatpackers buy from has, on average, 23 of its own suppliers, says Holly Gibbs of the University of Wisconsin. Current monitoring doesn't cover ranchers who breed and graze cattle, so it misses 85-90% of deforestation. Rogue fattening farms can also ""launder"" cattle by moving them to lawful farms-perhaps their own-right before selling them. A new Greenpeace report alleges that through this mechanism jbs, Marfrig and Minerva ended up selling beef from farms that deforested a protected Amazon reserve on the border between Brazil and Bolivia. They said they had not known about any illegality.
Soya-driven deforestation more directly affects the cerrado, the tropical savannah southeast of the rainforest. In Mato Grosso, a state that straddles the Amazon and the cerrado, 27% of deforestation between 2012 and 2017 took place on soya farms, according to a new report by Imaflora and Instituto Centro de Vida (icv), Brazilian research institutes, and Trase. The state provides a third of the eu's soya imports from Brazil. Ninety-five per cent of clearing on soya farms was illegal. A third occurred in the Amazon, revealing a gap in the soya moratorium. Since it only covers land where soya is planted, a farmer who illegally clears another part of his farm-say, for cattle-can continue selling to traders, who crush and export the soya.
Andr Nassar of Abiove, a soya-industry lobby, points out that the area of new soya fields planted on deforested land in the cerrado has fallen: from 215,000 hectares (530,000 acres) a year in 2000-06 to 79,000 hectares in 2013-18. The industry should distinguish legal from illegal deforestation, he says-it doesn't do annual monitoring in the cerrado-but embargoing farms is the responsibility of the government. Nonetheless, Bunge and Cargill have vowed to source only from land that has not been deforested, legally or illegally. They missed their 2020 deadline but plan to succeed by 2025 and 2030, respectively.
Perhaps they would move faster if they felt more pressure from customers and investors. One reason that soya giants seem more serious than meat producers about reducing deforestation, says Maria Lettini of fairr, a network of investors concerned about sustainability, is that most soya is exported. The eu is the second-top destination after China. But companies struggle to get people to pay more for a ""hidden commodity"", says Juliana Lopes of Amaggi, a Brazilian soya behemoth. ""You know your clothing is made of cotton and your chocolate comes from cacao,"" she says. But few people will pay extra for chicken made with sustainable soya, which explains why just 2-3% is certified deforestation-free. Better labelling could help, she says.
Four-fifths of Brazilian beef, by contrast, is eaten in Brazil. Exports go mostly to China, Russia and the Middle East, where feeding people is a higher priority than saving trees. Investors, for their part, see beef firms as unsexy businesses with thin margins. They haven't demanded huge efforts to reduce deforestation, says Joao Paulo Dibo of Rio Bravo Investimentos, an asset manager in Sao Paulo. Sexy or not, beef producers are doing well. While Brazilian share prices overall are down by 18% this year, Marfrig has seen its share price rise by 27% and Minerva has recovered what it lost at the start of the pandemic. jbs, the world's largest meatpacker, said 2019 was the most profitable year ever.
Morgan Stanley, Ita and Santander declined to discuss soya and meat companies with The Economist. A new 58-page report by Ita recommends investing in jbs, Marfrig and Minerva. (It doesn't contain the word ""deforestation"".) This reflects ""myopia"" at a time when investing in sustainable industry is rapidly expanding, says Fabio Alperowitch of fama Investimentos. It is one of 230 funds with more than $16trn in assets that signed a letter in the wake of last year's fires calling on firms to end deforestation. BlackRock, one of jbs's top-ten shareholders, did not sign, even though it is divesting from coal.
Economic turmoil makes it unlikely that companies will soon spend a lot to combat deforestation, says Marcello Brito of the Brazilian Agribusiness Association. ""Shareholders won't want it,"" he says.
Despite these discouragements, the firms say they are making progress. The meatpackers claim they are working towards their promise, made in 2009, to expand tracing to indirect suppliers. One idea is to use animal-transit permits, which track vaccinations as cattle are passed between ranchers, to flag deforestation. But the agriculture ministry has yet to agree. Minerva is considering using a tool developed by the University of Wisconsin, called Visipec, to map suppliers, identify regions with high deforestation and prioritise suppliers in other areas. Minerva gets 30% of its beef via full-cycle breeding, which it can guarantee is deforestation-free. Commercial restrictions could actually benefit the top firms, says its sustainability director, Taciano Custodio. ""We're better positioned to adapt.""
But change from the top three meatpackers won't guarantee a reduction in deforestation, because they account for less than half of the market. ""When we block a supplier, he can cross the road and sell to another slaughterhouse,"" says Mrcio Nappo of jbs. Industry-wide progress will require better enforcement and incentives for ranchers. ""We have to make production sustainable as a whole,"" says Mr Pianez.
That sentiment is echoed in the soya industry, where cracking down on deforestation is logistically simple but politically tough. According to the Mato Grosso study, 80% of illegal deforestation took place on 400 farms, 2% of the total. They are ""lowhanging fruit"" for action, says Mr Vasconcelos. But two years of talks about expanding the moratorium to the cerrado stalled. According to soya growers, multinational firms failed to raise $250m to launch a fund for compensating farmers who retain woodland. ""They demand, demand, demand, but don't offer anything in return,"" complains Ricardo Arioli.
Cargill says it will spend $30m on ways to stop deforestation industry-wide. Marfrig and Amaggi are backing an initiative launched by the government of Mato Grosso in 2015 to reduce deforestation through a ""landscape approach"". Fernando Sampaio, the director of its committee, which includes ngos and companies, says municipalities that reduce deforestation will receive technical assistance and credit and more business from the big firms, incentivising others to follow. But although the rate of deforestation in the state between August 2018 and July 2019 decreased by 4% from a year earlier, the initiative looks set to fall far short of its goal of ending illegal deforestation by 2020: 85% of the 1,685 square km cleared were done so illegally.
Among the biggest obstacles to progress is the lack of co-operation from the federal government. In a video of a cabinet meet- ing in April released by the Supreme Court, the environment minister, Ricardo Salles, called on the government to ""push through"" deregulation while people are distracted by the pandemic. A rule change in the indigenous agency allows landowners to claim chunks of indigenous territories that are awaiting official demarcation. Even the Amazon soya moratorium appears shaky. Aprosoja, a growers' lobby, threatened to abandon it (because it forbids legal deforestation). The agriculture minister, Tereza Cristina, called it ""absurd"".
Reducing deforestation will require consensus on tricky issues like the fate of tens of thousands of poor settlers on public lands in the Amazon, where half of deforestation takes place. However, environmentalists say that the ""land regularisation"" bill currently in Congress would also grant titles for big deforested tracts to ""land-grabbers"", sending the message that further clearing might also get a pass. An earlier version of the bill was rejected on May 20th after British supermarkets threatened to boycott Brazilian products.
Though still faint, such noises are growing louder. They add to the argument that companies should make changes not just for ethical reasons, but also for business reasons. Supermarkets could speed things up by telling consumers where their beef and soya come from. Getting farmers and ranchers on board will require the right balance of pressure and incentives. The companies have leverage, Ms Gibbs insists. A decade ago, after jbs, Marfrig and Minerva pledged to purge suppliers who deforested, more than 30 other beef firms signed similar agreements. ""If you could get a big company to take the first step, others would follow,"" she predicts.","The Amazon 
 SAO PAULO 
 Big firms do n't chop down trees . But their suppliers do 
 The world 's emissions of carbon dioxide may fall by 7 % this year because of lockdowns in response to the pandemic , according to Nature Climate Change , a journal . Brazil is a glaring exception . Its emissions will rise by 10 - 20 % from 2018 , when they were last measured , says the Climate Observatory , a consortium of research outfits . The culprit is deforestation . In the first four months of 2020 an estimated 1,202 square km ( 464 square miles ) were cleared in the Brazilian Amazon , 55 % more than during the same period in 2019 , which was the worst year in a decade . Come August , when ranchers set fire to cleared areas to prepare them for grazing , runaway blazes could outnumber those that shocked the world last year . Scientists say tree loss is nearing a "" tipping point , after which trees will dry out and die , releasing billions of tonnes of carbon into the atmosphere . 
 Environmentalists blame Jair Bolsonaro's for the catastrophe . Jair Bolsonaro favours deregulation to allow logging , mining and farming in the forest and has weakened enforcement of environmental laws . Less attention has been paid to the role of big firms like jbs and Cargill , global intermediaries for beef and soya , the commodities that drive deforestation ( see Graphic detail ) . 
 The companies do not chop down trees themselves . Rather , they are middlemen in complex supply chains that deal in soya and beef produced on deforested land . The process begins when speculators , who tend to operate outside the law , buy or seize land , sell the timber , graze cattle on it for several years and then sell it to a soya farmer . Land in the Amazon is five to ten times more valuable once it is deforested , says Daniel Nepstad , an ecologist . Not chopping down trees would have a large opportunity cost . In 2009 Mr Nepstad estimated that cost ( in terms of forgone beef and soy output ) would be $ 275bn over 30 years , about 16 % of that year 's gdp . 
 Under pressure from public opinion , the big firms have made attempts to control the problem . In 2009 , a damning report from Greenpeace led jbs , Marfrig and Minerva , meat giants which together handle two - thirds of Brazil 's exports , to pledge to stop buying from suppliers that deforest illegally . ( The forest code allows owners to clear 20 % of their land . ) jbs , which sources from an area in the Amazon larger than Germany , says it has blocked 9,000 suppliers , using satellites to detect clearing . Soya traders such as Cargill and Bunge have used such systems to enforce a zero - deforestation agreement for the region since 2008 , when retail firms like McDonald 's and Tesco said they would no longer buy Amazonian soya harvested on deforested land . 
 These agreements contributed to a sharp decline in the rate of tree loss until 2012 ( see chart on next page ) . Before the "" soya moratorium , 30 % of new fields in the Amazon involved clearing forests . In the eight years after it was signed , 99 % of soya expansion was on land that was already treeless . But , warns Andr Vasconcelos from Trase , an ngo that tracks com- modity supply chains , the frenzy of deforestation under Jair Bolsonaro could reverse this trend . 
 The deforestation surge shows that the agreements have an Achilles ' heel , says Mr Nepstad . The big firms are still not exerting the control they could over all their suppliers . And even if they did , large amounts of soya , and especially beef , are traded by smaller firms with weaker incentives to persuade farmers to change behaviour . 
 The problem is especially acute in ranching , which accounts for roughly 80 % of deforestation in the Amazon , nearly all of it illegal . "" Cows move around , "" explains Paulo Pianez of Marfrig . Every fattening farm the big meatpackers buy from has , on average , 23 of its own suppliers , says Holly Gibbs of the University of Wisconsin . Current monitoring does n't cover ranchers who breed and graze cattle , so it misses 85 - 90 % of deforestation . Rogue fattening farms can also "" launder "" cattle by moving them to lawful farms - perhaps their own - right before selling them . A new Greenpeace report alleges that through this mechanism jbs , Marfrig and Minerva ended up selling beef from farms that deforested a protected Amazon reserve on the border between Brazil and Bolivia . They said they had not known about any illegality . 
 Soya - driven deforestation more directly affects the cerrado , the tropical savannah southeast of the rainforest . In Mato Grosso , a state that straddles the Amazon and the cerrado , 27 % of deforestation between 2012 and 2017 took place on soya farms , according to a new report by Imaflora and Instituto Centro de Vida ( icv ) , Brazilian research institutes , and Trase . The state provides a third of the eu 's soya imports from Brazil . Ninety - five per cent of clearing on soya farms was illegal . A third occurred in the Amazon , revealing a gap in the soya moratorium . Since it only covers land where soya is planted , a farmer who illegally clears another part of his farm - say , for cattle - can continue selling to traders , who crush and export the soya . 
 Andr Nassar of Abiove , a soya - industry lobby , points out that the area of new soya fields planted on deforested land in the cerrado has fallen : from 215,000 hectares ( 530,000 acres ) a year in 2000 - 06 to 79,000 hectares in 2013 - 18 . The industry should distinguish legal from illegal deforestation , he says - it does n't do annual monitoring in the cerrado - but embargoing farms is the responsibility of the government . Nonetheless , Bunge and Cargill have vowed to source only from land that has not been deforested , legally or illegally . They missed their 2020 deadline but plan to succeed by 2025 and 2030 , respectively . 
 Perhaps they would move faster if they felt more pressure from customers and investors . One reason that soya giants seem more serious than meat producers about reducing deforestation , says Maria Lettini of fairr , a network of investors concerned about sustainability , is that most soya is exported . The eu is the second - top destination after China . But companies struggle to get people to pay more for a "" hidden commodity "" , says Juliana Lopes of Amaggi , a Brazilian soya behemoth . "" You know your clothing is made of cotton and your chocolate comes from cacao , "" she says . But few people will pay extra for chicken made with sustainable soya , which explains why just 2 - 3 % is certified deforestation - free . Better labelling could help , she says . 
 Four - fifths of Brazilian beef , by contrast , is eaten in Brazil . Exports go mostly to China , Russia and the Middle East , where feeding people is a higher priority than saving trees . Investors , for their part , see beef firms as unsexy businesses with thin margins . They have n't demanded huge efforts to reduce deforestation , says Joao Paulo Dibo of Rio Bravo Investimentos , an asset manager in Sao Paulo . Sexy or not , beef producers are doing well . While Brazilian share prices overall are down by 18 % this year , Marfrig has seen its share price rise by 27 % and Minerva has recovered what it lost at the start of the pandemic . jbs , the world 's largest meatpacker , said 2019 was the most profitable year ever . 
 Morgan Stanley , Ita and Santander declined to discuss soya and meat companies with The Economist . A new 58 - page report by Ita recommends investing in jbs , Marfrig and Minerva . ( It does n't contain the word "" deforestation "" . ) This reflects "" myopia "" at a time when investing in sustainable industry is rapidly expanding , says Fabio Alperowitch of fama Investimentos . It is one of 230 funds with more than $ 16trn in assets that signed a letter in the wake of last year 's fires calling on firms to end deforestation . BlackRock , one of jbs 's top - ten shareholders , did not sign , even though it is divesting from coal .

Most weekends since covid-19 hit Brazil, supporters of President Jair Bolsonaro have rallied in Brasilia and Sao Paulo. They demand the reopening of a partially locked-down economy, the shutting down of the Supreme Court and Congress and a return to the military rule of 1964-85. A few are armed. In the capital Mr Bolsonaro often joins them, dispensing hugs and handshakes in defiance of health regulations. Neither he nor they wear face masks.
Since Mr Bolsonaro, a former army captain with far-right views, took office in January 2019 many Brazilians have been sanguine about the threat he poses to democracy. Some argue that the country's institutions are strong enough to restrain him. True, the president has stuffed his government with military officers. But they have been seen as a moderating influence. And the demonstrations are small.
Tensions have risen in the past few weeks. Mr Bolsonaro has become more intimidating, saying of Congress, ""The time of villainy is over, now it's the people in power, and of the court, ""It's over, for fuck's sake. Some of the military ministers, starting with Vice-President Hamilton Mourao, a retired general, have issued veiled threats against the court, Congress and the media.
In a WhatsApp message leaked last month, Celso de Mello, the senior justice of the court, wrote: ""We must resist the destruction of the democratic order to avoid what happened in the Weimar Republic, which was overthrown by Hitler. ""Brazilian democracy is under serious threat, agrees Oscar Vilhena Vieira, the dean of the law school at the Fundao Getulio Vargas (fgv), a university. ""The president is not just trying to create an institutional conflict, [but also] trying to stimulate violent groups.
A backbench congressman for 28 years, Mr Bolsonaro has never shown much respect for democracy. He has now become more confrontational for two reasons. First, the Supreme Court has launched investigations that involve him. One is into his sacking of the federal police commander, to protect one of his sons from prosecution, say his critics. Another is into supporters (including another two of his sons) suspected of orchestrating slurs and threats towards the court's justices.
The second reason is that Mr Bolsonaro shows little ability to govern. The pandemic has dramatised that. His refusal to support lockdowns and social distancing has contributed to covid-19's severe toll in Brazil, with nearly 40,000 deaths, the world's third-highest number. He is losing popular support, although he retains a core of around 30% of voters.
It is a sign of his weakness that he increasingly relies on the army. Ten of his 22 ministers are now military men and 3,000 others are in government jobs. ""De facto we have a military regime, says a former officer. That carries risks for the armed forces as well as for democracy. Mr Bolsonaro has exacerbated the army's internal division and politicisation, which began earlier. Its discipline and hierarchy are fraying. Many junior officers voice their support for Mr Bolsonaro on social media. Four generals with jobs in the presidential palace, two on active service, have more power than the army commander, their nominal superior.
The army also runs a grave risk to its reputation. It is now in charge of the health ministry (where it briefly tried to halt publication of full covid-19 data), political co-ordination and protecting the Amazon. ""They really believe they know how to do things, says the former officer. They may learn the hard way, as during the dictatorship, that they don't.
Mr Bolsonaro does not look strong enough to pull off a coup. He is opposed by most of Brazil's state governors. Although the virus has temporarily disabled Congress, Mr Vieira notes that the Supreme Court is acting in an unusually united way. Nevertheless, ""democracy can die even if you don't have a strongman, warns Matias Spektor of the Centre for International Relations at fgv. If Mr Bolsonaro is eventually impeached Mr Mourao would succeed him, bringing the army still closer to power.
Another threat, notes Mr Spektor, is Mr Bolsonaro's hollowing out of Brazil's democratic institutions and fomenting of conflict. He has installed a friendly prosecutor-general, and has influence over the state police forces as well as the federal police. A police raid has silenced Rio de Janeiro's governor, recently a critic of Mr Bolsonaro's. Brazilian democrats, often adversaries, are starting to unite in opposition to the president. They are right to be alarmed.","Jair Bolsonaro dreams of a return to military rule . What does the army think ?

AMSTERDAM, JOHANNESBURG, MELKSHAM, MEXICO CITY, PARIS AND SAO PAULO
The killing of one man in Minneapolis has sparked global protests
Local police arrested Giovanni Lpez, a 30-year-old Mexican bricklayer, in Ixtlahuacn de los Membrillos, a town near Guadalajara, on May 4th. Why they detained him is unclear. The next morning his family found him dead in a nearby hospital, with bruises on his head and a bullet in his ankle. His name did not go viral; no politician lamented his death.
Christian Lpez, who filmed his brother's arrest, stayed silent at first. He would later claim that messengers acting on behalf of the local mayor threatened to kill his family if the footage went public. But then came the killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis, and the anti-police, anti-racism backlash that has swept the world. ""I saw it and thought, this is the same thing that happened to my brother,"" he says. On June 1st he went to the press.
The chief prosecutor in the state of Jalisco, where the death occurred, faced a barrage of questions. On June 4th a march in Guadalajara, marking a month since Giovanni's death, turned violent. Calls demanding #Justiciaparagiovanni increased. The three officers connected with Giovanni's death were arrested. The mayor's role is under investigation. Protests have since spread to Tijuana and the state of Veracruz against two local pre-Floyd police killings, of Oliver Lpez (no relation) in March and Carlos Andrs Navarro in May.
Mr Floyd's death has provoked protests around the world. Why his death set off a global movement whereas countless other unjust killings did not is hard to say. Mr Floyd was American, of course, and the world pays more attention to the United States than to Mexico or any other country. His death was filmed in excruciating detail. It happened at a time when billions of people were cooped up and frustrated at home, thanks to covid-19. Lockdowns have surely made the global mood more combustible.
But the important points are that police brutality is rife in many countries and minorities fear discrimination everywhere. That is why Mr Floyd's fate resonated. Just as women on every continent found common cause in the #MeToo movement, despite the range of their experiences, so protesters around the world have united around the cry that black lives matter.
At their simplest the protests mark people's antipathy towards cops who beat or kill those whom they vowed to protect. Protests have spread throughout Mexico, where nine in ten homicides go unpunished and many police moonlight for the other side. The country's most notorious unsolved crime, the disappearance and presumed murder in 2014 of 43 student teachers in the town of Ayotzinapa, is thought to have been orchestrated by police paid by drug gangs.
Some of the global anger is directed at the United States. Protests have erupted outside American embassies from Spain to South Africa. Nana Akufo-Addo, Ghana's president, tweeted that: ""Black people, the world over, are shocked and distraught."" President Cyril Ramaphosa of South Africa said: ""The killing of George Floyd has opened up deep wounds for us all.""
Many protesters would agree. But many also seethe that their leaders condemn po- lice abuse in Minnesota while allowing or even encouraging it at home. America's police kill more people than those of any other rich democracy, but cops in some developing countries are much more lethal (see chart 1). So plenty of the protests around the world are about local abuses as well.
On June 8th in Mathare, a poor part of Nairobi, about 200 Kenyans marched against police atrocities. Since a covid-19 curfew was introduced in Kenya's capital on March 27th police have killed 15 people, according to the country's Independent Police Oversight Authority. ""[T]he poor people of this country have come together to say no to police killings...and also stand in solidarity with the global protest against police excesses,"" Juliet Wanjera, a member of the Mathare Social Justice Centre, an ngo, has told journalists.
Since 2012 there have been more than 40,000 complaints against the South African Police Service for alleged crimes including rape and murder, with just 531 convictions. Security forces have killed at least 11 people during South Africa's lockdown, in place since March 27th, and more than 200,000 have been arrested. Mr Ramaphosa has said merely that authorities have been guilty of ""over-enthusiasm"".
That will not wash with many South Africans. The killing on April 10th of Collins Khosa, a 40-year-old man from Alexandra, a township in Johannesburg, by soldiers, has prompted particular outrage. According to his family, Mr Khosa was targeted for drinking a beer even though he was on his own property. (Buying alcohol was illegal in April and May, as per lockdown regulations, but drinking it was not.)
Some analysts worry that police abuse in America may make it easier for others to follow suit. ""It will certainly be very easy for leaders in Africa, those with their own dictatorial tendencies, to justify future behaviour by referencing the actions of the us administration in the last few weeks,"" argues Idayat Hassan of the Centre for Democracy and Development, a think-tank in Abuja, Nigeria. Police brutality in developing countries rarely prompts a global reaction. The killing by Zimbabwean security forces of 17 protesters in January 2019 did not lead to mass protests elsewhere.
In the state of Rio de Janeiro (population 6.3m), police killed 1,810 people last year, nearly twice as many as in the United States (population 328m). Police say most of the dead are gunmen from favelas, informal settlements that are often controlled by criminals. But watchdogs point to a rise in extrajudicial killings, including massacres of more than ten people, fuelled by warlike police operations, sometimes with snipers in helicopters. Images of smiling children killed by police all too often appear on people's televisions. They include eight-year-old Agatha, shot by a stray bullet last September while riding in a van with her mother, and 14-year-old Joao Pedro, killed in a botched police raid last month.
Brazilians in more than ten cities took to the streets on June 7th to mourn their deaths and to protest against the government of Jair Bolsonaro, a populist who campaigned on promises to give immunity to police who kill. He said last year that a bill to this effect would cause criminals to ""die in the streets like cockroaches"". Congress rejected the measure, but Brazil's trigger-happy police are rarely prosecuted. Still, on June 5th a Supreme Court judge banned most police operations in favelas for the remainder of the pandemic.
Of the 6,220 people killed by Brazil's police in 2018, three out of four were black. In Indonesia, #BlackLivesMatter has found new relevance as #PapuanLivesMatter. Indonesia runs half of the island of New Guinea, and controls it almost as if it were an occupying power. Papuans-whose skin is darker than that of other Indonesians- face bleak economic prospects and violence at the hands of security forces.
In 2019 a Papuan student dormitory in Surabaya in eastern Java was besieged by a mob claiming its inhabitants had thrown the national flag into a gutter. Some taunted them as ""monkeys"". Rather than dispersing the mob, riot police stormed the dorm with tear-gas and arrested 43 Papuans. That and similar actions in other cities were the catalyst last summer for huge demonstrations by young Indonesians in support of Papuans. In recent days calls have grown for Indonesians to denounce the discrimination that Papuans suffer.
A determined people
Even where police brutality is rarer, attention has turned to domestic racism. In Melksham, a small town in England, 120 people gathered on June 7th to protest against it. Some 97% of the town's inhabitants are white. It has not seen a major protest since woollen-mill workers rioted in 1802. ""White privilege doesn't mean your life hasn't been hard,"" Botan Williams, the event's 15-year-old organiser, told the crowd, ""it just means your skin colour isn't one of the things making it harder.""
Throughout Britain demonstrators have echoed their American counterparts, chanting ""hands up, don't shoot"" at (unarmed) police. Placards named black victims of British police violence: Mark Duggan, Rashan Charles and Edson Da Costa. Black people are just 3% of the population in England and Wales but 12% of prisoners. Black men are stopped and searched at nine times the rate of white men.
Similarly in Australia Aboriginals and Torres Strait islanders are just over 3% of the overall population but 29% of those in prison. An indigenous female Australian is more likely to be behind bars than a nonindigenous male. Scott Morrison, the conservative prime minister, says: ""There is no need to import things happening in other countries here to Australia"" because ""Australia is a fair country...[it] is not the United States."" Protesters were unconvinced. Indigenous Australians are poorer and less healthy-and have less access to housing, land, education and social workers-than other Australians.
The first demonstration in France since Mr Floyd's death brought 20,000 people carrying ""Black Lives Matter"" banners to the main Paris courthouse on June 2nd. It centred on a French controversy: the death in 2016 of Adama Traor, a 24-year-old who was pinned to the ground by police officers during his arrest. A medical report released on the morning of the demonstration suggested that he was asphyxiated. The Floyd protests carry particular resonance in the banlieues, high-rise estates where friction between the police and residents, many of them of immigrant origin, frames daily life. This distrust can erupt into confrontation, violence and, occasionally, death. There were 19 deaths in France during police operations last year.
France is the first European country where the protests have changed policy. Earlier this year, after a motorbike courier died of asphyxiation during his arrest in Paris, President Emmanuel Macron asked Christophe Castaner, his interior minister, to come up with ways to ""improve police ethics"". On June 8th those proposals were hastily put together. Mr Castaner acknowledged racism within the police force, and said that choke holds would be banned. France would take a ""zero tolerance"" approach to racism, he declared.
Before the protests, New Zealand was mulling whether to equip more of its usually unarmed police with guns. Evaluation of a six-month trial was to have been completed by the end of June. But on June 9th the head of police said he had received over 4,000 letters in a week, and that the plan would be permanently scrapped.
Some Europeans have deplored American racism while failing to see the parallels in their own countries. Europe's biggest Black Lives Matter rallies were in Germany. Signs in English were far more prominent than German ones. In Spain, too, demonstrators mostly condemned American racism, with only cursory mentions of Europe's treatment of African migrants. There were few mentions of Europe's widespread religious discrimination against Muslims.
Europeans are sometimes complacent about racism. Granted, European police shoot far fewer people than American police do. But this is largely because they are less likely to be shot at. Last year 48 police were killed-most of them shot- in the line of duty in America; in Britain one was.
Measuring prejudice is hard. Racist attitudes have been socially unacceptable nearly everywhere for decades, so many who harbour them will not admit it to pollsters. But some do. And according to a recent international World Values Survey, more Germans and Dutch say they would not want ""people of another race"" as neighbours than Americans (see chart 2).
Ethnic profiling by police is illegal in most countries, but common. Members of minorities (especially young men) are routinely frisked and asked for identification when out in public. In private, many police admit to taking account of race when deciding whom to stop, noting that some groups, for a variety of reasons, commit more crimes than others. Such profiling makes life much harder for those who happen to belong to those groups, the vast majority of whom are law-abiding.
Many people do not care. Brazilians knew what to expect when they elected Mr Bolsonaro. Two-thirds of Germans think racial profiling is an acceptable tool of policing, according to a poll in 2017 by YouGov. ""The worst thing about it,"" says Sony Kapoor, an Indian-born Briton who lives in Norway, ""is the smugness of Europeans who think they don't harbour the same sort of racism as Americans.""","Black Lives Matter 
 AMSTERDAM , JOHANNESBURG , MELKSHAM , MEXICO CITY , PARIS AND SAO PAULO 
 The killing of one man in Minneapolis has sparked global protests 
 Local police arrested Giovanni Lpez , a 30 - year - old Mexican bricklayer , in Ixtlahuacn de los Membrillos , a town near Guadalajara , on May 4th . Why they detained him is unclear . The next morning his family found him dead in a nearby hospital , with bruises on his head and a bullet in his ankle . His name did not go viral ; no politician lamented his death . 
 Christian Lpez , who filmed his brother 's arrest , stayed silent at first . He would later claim that messengers acting on behalf of the local mayor threatened to kill his family if the footage went public . But then came the killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis , and the anti - police , anti - racism backlash that has swept the world . "" I saw it and thought , this is the same thing that happened to my brother , "" he says . On June 1st he went to the press . 
 The chief prosecutor in the state of Jalisco , where the death occurred , faced a barrage of questions . On June 4th a march in Guadalajara , marking a month since Giovanni 's death , turned violent . Calls demanding # Justiciaparagiovanni increased . The three officers connected with Giovanni 's death were arrested . The mayor 's role is under investigation . Protests have since spread to Tijuana and the state of Veracruz against two local pre - Floyd police killings , of Oliver Lpez ( no relation ) in March and Carlos Andrs Navarro in May. 
 Mr Floyd 's death has provoked protests around the world . Why his death set off a global movement whereas countless other unjust killings did not is hard to say . Mr Floyd was American , of course , and the world pays more attention to the United States than to Mexico or any other country . His death was filmed in excruciating detail . It happened at a time when billions of people were cooped up and frustrated at home , thanks to covid-19 . Lockdowns have surely made the global mood more combustible . 
 But the important points are that police brutality is rife in many countries and minorities fear discrimination everywhere . That is why Mr Floyd 's fate resonated . Just as women on every continent found common cause in the # MeToo movement , despite the range of their experiences , so protesters around the world have united around the cry that black lives matter . 
 At their simplest the protests mark people 's antipathy towards cops who beat or kill those whom they vowed to protect . Protests have spread throughout Mexico , where nine in ten homicides go unpunished and many police moonlight for the other side . The country 's most notorious unsolved crime , the disappearance and presumed murder in 2014 of 43 student teachers in the town of Ayotzinapa , is thought to have been orchestrated by police paid by drug gangs . 
 Some of the global anger is directed at the United States . Protests have erupted outside American embassies from Spain to South Africa . Nana Akufo - Addo , Ghana 's president , tweeted that : "" Black people , the world over , are shocked and distraught . "" President Cyril Ramaphosa of South Africa said : "" The killing of George Floyd has opened up deep wounds for us all . "" 
 Many protesters would agree . But many also seethe that their leaders condemn po- lice abuse in Minnesota while allowing or even encouraging it at home . America 's police kill more people than those of any other rich democracy , but cops in some developing countries are much more lethal ( see chart 1 ) . So plenty of the protests around the world are about local abuses as well . 
 On June 8th in Mathare , a poor part of Nairobi , about 200 Kenyans marched against police atrocities . Since a covid-19 curfew was introduced in Kenya 's capital on March 27th police have killed 15 people , according to the country 's Independent Police Oversight Authority . "" [ T]he poor people of this country have come together to say no to police killings ... and also stand in solidarity with the global protest against police excesses , "" Juliet Wanjera , a member of the Mathare Social Justice Centre , an ngo , has told journalists . 
 Since 2012 there have been more than 40,000 complaints against the South African Police Service for alleged crimes including rape and murder , with just 531 convictions . Security forces have killed at least 11 people during South Africa 's lockdown , in place since March 27th , and more than 200,000 have been arrested . Mr Ramaphosa has said merely that authorities have been guilty of "" over - enthusiasm "" . 
 That will not wash with many South Africans . The killing on April 10th of Collins Khosa , a 40 - year - old man from Alexandra , a township in Johannesburg , by soldiers , has prompted particular outrage . According to his family , Mr Khosa was targeted for drinking a beer even though he was on his own property . ( Buying alcohol was illegal in April and May , as per lockdown regulations , but drinking it was not . ) 
 Some analysts worry that police abuse in America may make it easier for others to follow suit . "" It will certainly be very easy for leaders in Africa , those with their own dictatorial tendencies , to justify future behaviour by referencing the actions of the us administration in the last few weeks , "" argues Idayat Hassan of the Centre for Democracy and Development , a think - tank in Abuja , Nigeria . Police brutality in developing countries rarely prompts a global reaction . The killing by Zimbabwean security forces of 17 protesters in January 2019 did not lead to mass protests elsewhere . 
 In the state of Rio de Janeiro ( population 6.3 m ) , police killed 1,810 people last year , nearly twice as many as in the United States ( population 328 m ) . Police say most of the dead are gunmen from favelas , informal settlements that are often controlled by criminals . But watchdogs point to a rise in extrajudicial killings , including massacres of more than ten people , fuelled by warlike police operations , sometimes with snipers in helicopters . Images of smiling children killed by police all too often appear on people 's televisions . They include eight - year - old Agatha , shot by a stray bullet last September while riding in a van with her mother , and 14 - year - old Joao Pedro , killed in a botched police raid last month . 
 Brazilians in more than ten cities took to the streets on June 7th to mourn their deaths and to protest against the government of Jair Bolsonaro . Jair Bolsonaro said last year that a bill to this effect would cause criminals to "" die in the streets like cockroaches "" . Congress rejected the measure , but Brazil 's trigger - happy police are rarely prosecuted . Still , on June 5th a Supreme Court judge banned most police operations in favelas for the remainder of the pandemic . 
 Of the 6,220 people killed by Brazil 's police in 2018 , three out of four were black . In Indonesia , # BlackLivesMatter has found new relevance as # PapuanLivesMatter . Indonesia runs half of the island of New Guinea , and controls it almost as if it were an occupying power . Papuans - whose skin is darker than that of other Indonesians- face bleak economic prospects and violence at the hands of security forces . 
 In 2019 a Papuan student dormitory in Surabaya in eastern Java was besieged by a mob claiming its inhabitants had thrown the national flag into a gutter . Some taunted them as "" monkeys "" . Rather than dispersing the mob , riot police stormed the dorm with tear - gas and arrested 43 Papuans . That and similar actions in other cities were the catalyst last summer for huge demonstrations by young Indonesians in support of Papuans . In recent days calls have grown for Indonesians to denounce the discrimination that Papuans suffer . 
 A determined people 
 Even where police brutality is rarer , attention has turned to domestic racism . In Melksham , a small town in England , 120 people gathered on June 7th to protest against it . Some 97 % of the town 's inhabitants are white . It has not seen a major protest since woollen - mill workers rioted in 1802 . "" White privilege does n't mean your life has n't been hard , "" Botan Williams , the event 's 15 - year - old organiser , told the crowd , "" it just means your skin colour is n't one of the things making it harder . ""

Placards named black victims of British police violence : Mark Duggan , Rashan Charles and Edson Da Costa . Black people are just 3 % of the population in England and Wales but 12 % of prisoners .

MEXICO CITY
Mexico's failures illustrate why Latin America is now the centre of the pandemic
On a spring afternoon in Mexicali, in northern Mexico, Erick Mercado pondered what was coming. The private Hispanic American Hospital, where he runs the accident-and-emergency service, had cancelled all elective surgery and made plans to seal off the second floor. In half an hour, he explained, the governor of Baja California would confirm the state's first coronavirus cases. People with flu-like symptoms, Dr Mercado predicted, would ""go into a panic and rush to hospitals for testing. Sure enough, a queue appeared in the car park by nightfall.
Three months later, Dr Mercado and his hospital are at breaking point. For every covid-19 patient to whom he can offer a bed, he must turn away five. More than 90% of the city's hospital beds are taken, and the number of registered deaths nearly tripled to 660 in the first half of June. Dr Mercado's days are filled with suffering patients, exhausted staff and visitors who cannot approach loved ones. Most distressing of all is knowing that ""people who do not comply with government orders to stay at home, wear masks and keep social distance have made the pandemic worse.
His frustration is provoked by the messiness of Mexico's response to covid-19. The government shut down the formal part of the economy on March 30th, when fewer than 1,000 cases had been registered. But- unlike in richer countries-its lockdown order failed to contain the outbreak (see chart on next page). Mexico has 159,793 confirmed cases and 19,080 deaths. Although the number of new cases nationally has lately fallen, it is still rising in 27 of the 32 states. Yet with covid-19 on the rampage, the country is easing its controls.
The rest of Latin America shares its plight. The region is reporting more cases each day than Europe did during its covid-19 peak in April. By some measures it is the world's most urbanised region, which may help explain the virus's spread. Governments' responses have varied greatly. Brazil's President Jair Bolsonaro has been cavalier, dismissing covid-19 as ""sniffles and breaching his own health ministry's social-distancing advice. Nicaragua's Daniel Ortega imposed no lockdown. Governments in Peru, Argentina and elsewhere acted early and sternly, using the police to enforce quarantine orders. Yet with few exceptions (see next story), the spread of the virus has been swift.
Even where the rules are strict, many people have not obeyed. The rich have adhered to lockdowns more than the poor. Many informal workers-street vendors, cleaners and the like-must work to eat. Few Latin American countries have European-style safety nets. Many have nonetheless provided emergency aid. In Brazil, El Salvador and elsewhere beneficiaries flocked to cashpoints, potentially spreading the virus. In a region where trust in government is low, citizens are detached from the state ""not just legally, but emotionally and cognitively, says Hugo Ñopo, a Peruvian economist. That makes them less inclined to listen to pandemic pleas from officialdom. The resignation, firing or arrest of six Latin American health ministers since March is unlikely to have bolstered citizens' confidence in
governments. Despite the region's leaky lockdowns, ? its economy will shrink by 7.2% this year, more than anywhere else, predicts the World Bank. Small wonder that governments besides Mexico's are contemplating ending lockdowns before they have tamed the disease. They are taking a gamble.
A quasi-quarantine is better than none. Andrés Manuel López Obrador, Mexico's president, has said in private meetings that his priority is to avoid the apocalypse that struck Guayaquil, Ecuador's largest city, where corpses lay in the streets in April. Mexico's quarantine achieved that, buying time for the government to find extra beds, doctors and ventilators, educate citizens and review research about how to halt the virus. It was loose by design, avoiding ""authoritarian"" restrictions on movement and allowing workers in informal jobs to continue to practise their trades. Nonetheless, the government expects up to 10m people to fall below its poverty line this year.
In Iztapalapa, a suburb of Mexico City that has the country's highest confirmed infection rate, both the lockdown and the government that ordered it seem distant. On Callejon 57, a tiny colourful street, life carries on as normal. Although Mexican media dubbed it ""Covid Alley"" after it saw 45 deaths in three months, many residents downplay the threat. One man says the powers that be want to kill off pensioners. Another, whose uncle died recently (""not from covid-19""), thinks the government is exaggerating to keep the poor under its thumb. Others doubt the virus is real. Yet most residents make some effort to protect themselves and others. ""When the deaths started the masks came out,"" says Miguel Contreras from behind a sheet of plastic at his hole-in-the-wall convenience store.
Joaquín Reyes recalls that when his 90year-old grandmother died, he could say farewell only by phone, through a doctor. The doctor said covid-19 ""probably"" killed her, though the death certificate does not mention it. Mr Reyes, who wears a mask as he flattens chicken breasts at the stall outside his house on Callejon 57, is unsure. His till, a margarine tub packed with coins, is filled with water to ward off germs. This reassures customers, he explains. As ever, he is working long hours and resting only on Sundays. ""If I had money, I would stay in my house all day,"" he says.
Covid-19's devastation is greater than the government admits. Among the 25 countries with most cases, none tests fewer people than Mexico as a share of population. Two in five tests are positive, a sign that the outbreak is being badly undercounted. An analysis of death certificates shows that between April 1st and June 7th Mexico City had 17,000 more deaths than it normally does over that period. This suggests a toll nearly four times the government's count. The capital's excess deaths are nearing New York's 25,000, even though its people are on average younger.
Despite this, Mexico's government is desperate to end lockdown. It expects the pandemic to peak this month. The government has introduced a traffic-light system, which encourages states that are taming the virus ease lockdowns. Just one state qualified for any colour other than red. But the government tweaked its criteria so that 16 could begin to reopen on June 15th. Mexico City, which remains red, is starting to reopen anyway.
Other countries that left lockdowns prematurely have suffered. Guatemala and Venezuela have tried alternating between tough and loose regimes, only to find that cases rise after streets fill up during lax phases. Panama City and Santiago, Chile's capital, have reinforced lockdowns after authorities declared victory too early. Chile now has the highest confirmed infection rate of any non-tiny country.
Even so, many countries, suffering lockdown fatigue along with economic pain, are moving towards gradual easing. Bolivia, Colombia and Honduras, whose president, Juan Orlando Hernández, was hospitalised after testing positive for the virus, plan to phase out their lockdowns this month. Governments hope thereby to support their economies. They run the risk of boosting the virus, too.

2020-06-20,https://www-proquest-com.proxy.uchicago.edu/abicomplete/docview/2415030698/fulltext/B00EB9C20E924622PQ/35?accountid=14657,"A gringo takeover bid for a Latin American development bank
Since it was founded in 1959, the InterAmerican Development Bank (idb) has had just four presidents: a Chilean, a Mexican, a Uruguayan and, since 2005, Luis Alberto Moreno, a Colombian. Under the gentlemen's agreement by which it was founded, Latin America has the presidency and a small majority of the capital while the United States has the number-two job and some informal vetoes over how the bank is run. The idb has not been free of the faults of such institutions, such as bureaucracy and a degree of cronyism, but it has played an important role in the region. It lends around $i2bn a year for infrastructure, health, education and so on, does some useful research and advises governments. It has also been a channel of communication between the two halves of the Americas.
Donald Trump doesn't believe in gentlemen's agreements, and his administration this week broke this one. The Treasury Department named Mauricio Claver-Carone, the top official for Latin America at the National Security Council (nsc), as its candidate to replace Mr Moreno, who is due to step down in September. Mr Claver-Carone, a CubanAmerican, is technically qualified for the post. He has been an adviser to the Treasury and a representative to the imf, and was involved in the Trump administration's initiatives on development finance. He has told interlocutors that he would serve only one term at the idb, would bring fresh ideas and would be better placed than a Latin American to get the Treasury's crucial support for a capital increase that would give the bank resources to mitigate the covid-19 slump in the region. These are things that many in Latin America might welcome.
But Mr Claver-Carone is a controversial choice, and not just because his nomination breaks with tradition. At the nsc he has been the chief architect of Mr Trump's Venezuela policy, which has failed in its aim of getting rid of the dictatorship of Nicolás Maduro. ""He's a guy who comes with very Miami-type baggage, adversarial to Cuba and Venezuela and representing a conservative alliance,"" says a Latin American diplomat. ""He would bring ideology directly into the bank."" Mr Claver-Carone walked out of the inauguration of Argentina's president, Alberto Fernández, in December because of the presence of a Venezuelan minister. Many who have dealt with him describe him as arrogant and confrontational.
Given the Trump administration's cold war against China, Mr Claver-Carone's appointment as head of the idb might force Latin America to choose between the two countries, which the region is reluctant to do. Although China is granting fewer loans to Latin America than it did recently, it remains one of the region's most important trade partners. The Trump administration was furious with Mr Moreno for agreeing to hold the bank's annual meeting in China in 2019 (though in the event it was delayed and moved to Ecuador because of a row over who represented Venezuela). Mr Claver-Carone has his own animus against Mr Moreno, who vetoed his appointment as the bank's vice-president.
For Latin America the loss of the idb presidency would be a big diplomatic defeat, reflecting the region's weakness and ideological division. Its leaders are a generally unimpressive bunch. They have failed to unite behind a candidate of their own. Diplomats expected the job to go either to Brazil or to Argentina. Jair Bolsonaro's government in Brazil informally canvassed support for Rodrigo Xavier, an experienced banker. Argentina's putative candidate, Gustavo Béliz, is a competent former idb official, but its centre-left government has few allies in the region. Brazil looks likely to back Mr Claver-Carone, mainly because Mr Bolsonaro has aligned himself closely with Mr Trump. Other smaller countries may, too, because they are desperate for money.
The new president must secure a double majority, of countries representing 50% of the idb's shares (the United States has 30% and Brazil 11%) and separately of the 28 members in the Americas. That may yet be a problem for Mr Claver-Carone.
The biggest reason to oppose his nomination is that he represents a polarising administration that may well lose an election in November, making him ""the earliest lame duck in history"", as a South American official puts it. The sensible course would be to extend Mr Moreno's term until next year, both to give time for other candidates to emerge and to see whether Mr Claver-Carone really represents the United States.","A gringo takeover bid for a Latin American development bank 
 Since it was founded in 1959 , the InterAmerican Development Bank ( idb ) has had just four presidents : a Chilean , a Mexican , a Uruguayan and , since 2005 , Luis Alberto Moreno , a Colombian . Under the gentlemen 's agreement by which it was founded , Latin America has the presidency and a small majority of the capital while the United States has the number - two job and some informal vetoes over how the bank is run . The idb has not been free of the faults of such institutions , such as bureaucracy and a degree of cronyism , but it has played an important role in the region . It lends around $ i2bn a year for infrastructure , health , education and so on , does some useful research and advises governments . It has also been a channel of communication between the two halves of the Americas . 
 Donald Trump does n't believe in gentlemen 's agreements , and his administration this week broke this one . The Treasury Department named Mauricio Claver - Carone , the top official for Latin America at the National Security Council ( nsc ) , as its candidate to replace Mr Moreno , who is due to step down in September . Mr Claver - Carone , a CubanAmerican , is technically qualified for the post . He has been an adviser to the Treasury and a representative to the imf , and was involved in the Trump administration 's initiatives on development finance . He has told interlocutors that he would serve only one term at the idb , would bring fresh ideas and would be better placed than a Latin American to get the Treasury 's crucial support for a capital increase that would give the bank resources to mitigate the covid-19 slump in the region . These are things that many in Latin America might welcome . 
 But Mr Claver - Carone is a controversial choice , and not just because his nomination breaks with tradition . At the nsc he has been the chief architect of Mr Trump 's Venezuela policy , which has failed in its aim of getting rid of the dictatorship of Nicolás Maduro .

A messy restart to the beautiful game
BEFORE COVID-19 hit Brazil, Santo André, a football club from the outskirts of Sāo Paulo, was leading the state championship. It hoped to secure a spot in the national one next year. On March 16th, with two regular games left to play, the league shut down. Santo André's stadium became a field hospital. At least five players whose contracts expired during the hiatus left for other clubs.
In June its president, Sidney Riquetto, learned that other state clubs were flouting quarantines to practise secretly, sometimes without uniforms on municipal pitches. Mr Riquetto cried foul. In a scramble for the ball, ""players in better shape will get there first, he complains.
Brazil, which has won the football World Cup five times (including 50 years ago this week), is eager to resume playing the game it thinks it plays better than anyone else. But kicking off during the covid-19 outbreak is proving tricky and contentious. Brazil has recorded 1.2m cases and 53,830 deaths, more than any other country except the United States.
Ninety-five players from the top league, nearly a sixth, have tested positive for the coronavirus. Nine are from Flamengo, 2019's national champions from Rio de Janeiro. They hosted Brazil's first mid-pandemic match on June 18th at Maracaná stadium (against Bangu, with no fans), metres away from a covid-19 field hospital.
In Sāo Paulo, which still bans matches, clubs are getting antsy. ""We have been very patient, says Thiago Scuro, the athletic director of Red Bull Bragantino, though not enough to abide by a leaguewide pact not to train as long as clubs in some parts of the state are not allowed. (The club has now agreed to wait until July 1st, when the governor says practice can resume state-wide.)
Brazil's president, Jair Bolsonaro, a Flamengo fan, is keen for the sport to restart. Odds of a footballer dying from covid-19 are ""infinitely small, he says. But football's bosses are trying to be more responsible. There is ""no evidence that athletes can't get ill, say guidelines for clubs published by Brazil's Football Federation. They recommend no spitting or handshakes. Less reassuring is the suggestion for clubs that do not have coronavirus tests on hand: ask a player to sniff coffee placed 5cm away from his nose. If he can smell it, he's probably not infected. Santo André plan to house players in rented training centres to keep them covid-free. If other clubs take such care, Mr Riquetto says, football will help restore a ""sense of normality to Brazil. It's a big if, he admits.","Brazil

THE COVID-19 pandemic has still not peaked in Latin America, and it is likely to last for several more months. Apart from the toll in human lives, the virus and the efforts to fight it through lockdowns have hammered economies and forced tens of millions of Latin Americans into poverty. The imf expects the economy of the region (including the Caribbean) to contract by 9.4% this year, with only a moderate recovery next. Harder to divine are the political implications of this hardship. But if history is a guide, they will be great.
Latin America has seen slumps on this scale only twice in the past century. The first was triggered by the Wall Street crash of 1929. By 1932, many of the region's economies had shrunk by 20% (and 40% in the case of Chile and Cuba). Export earnings and investment collapsed. In most cases recovery came only in 1933. The second slump was in the 1980s, when a string of countries defaulted on their foreign debts after international interest rates soared. For Latin America as a whole, gdp per person shrank by almost a tenth between 1981 and 1983. Recovery was much slower than in the 1930s. The 1980s became known as the ""lost decade.
Both these periods saw political upheaval. Between 1930 and 1933 the armed forces pushed aside civilian governments and took power in eight Latin American countries. In Chile the reverse happened: a popular uprising overthrew the government of General Carlos Ibáñez in 1931. Over the next 18 months Chile suffered nine successive governments, two general strikes and several coups before settling down under civilian rule for the next 40 years. The 1980s saw the opposite trend. Dictatorships, which had prevailed in the region, yielded to elected democratic governments in eight countries between 1982 and 1989.
Covid-19 struck Latin America as it was already suffering political strains because of several years of slow economic growth and popular discontent over corruption and poor public services. This discontent manifested itself in the defeat of incumbent parties in many recent elections, the rise to power of populist outsiders in Brazil and Mexico in 2018 and a wave of street protests last year, notably in Ecuador, Chile and Bolivia.
The immediate effect of the pandemic has been to strengthen presidents in several countries. The public has generally applauded rulers who have tried to save lives with lockdowns. And these lockdowns have made it harder for opponents to fight back, either in the streets or in hampered legislatures. When the pandemic ebbs but its economic consequences linger, anger is likely to resurface and may be directed at governments. ""Rally-roundthe-flag is a very short-term effect; in a couple of years people won't connect the economic crisis with the virus, says Daniela Campello, the co-author of a forthcoming book on the links between economic volatility and political instability in South America. ""It's hard to see any kind of [political] equilibrium or maintenance of the status quo.
What political direction will popular anger take? One answer might be that it will breed more populism. That is possible, but it may not apply where populism is the status quo. And populists tend to have a hard time when money is short. Optimists think that the overriding lesson of covid-19 is that democratic governments, armed with science and openness, are doing a better job than populists, and that voters will reward them. That may be so in richer parts of the world. In Latin America opposition to incumbents, whether populists or democrats, is more likely to be the trend.
If the 1930s and the 1980s are any guide, the current slump may prompt regime change. After three mainly democratic decades, the risk is of a return to authoritarian rule. Already some presidents, such as Nayib Bukele in El Salvador and Jeanine Áñez, Bolivia's interim ruler, have used the pandemic as a pretext to grab extra powers.
The biggest threat is that the army returns as a political actor, as it already has in Brazil under Jair Bolsonaro, Venezuela under Nicolás Maduro and to an extent in Mexico and Bolivia. That is partly because police may struggle to maintain public order in the face of popular anger. It is also because satisfaction with democracy and its institutions, already low in many countries, may fall further, and would-be authoritarians, civilian or military, may spy an opportunity. History need not repeat itself. Nevertheless, Latin America's democrats will have their work cut out.","The risk of regime change and a new authoritarianism

S&Acaron;O PAULO
Missionaries are eager to convert isolated indigenous groups in the Amazon. Brazil's president is on their side
Marcos mayoruna found Jesus 15 years ago. The son of a cacique (chief) from the Vale do Javari, an indigenous territory in the Brazilian Amazon larger than Austria, he was converted by a missionary from another ethnic group and became a pastor himself. After seminary in Rio de Janeiro he went home to spread the word of God to the Mayoruna and other tribes.
He sometimes worked with Brazilian and American missionaries, swapping his local knowledge for donations to his humble seminary in Atalaia do Norte, a dusty town in the northern part of the valley. But, he says, the missionaries seemed more interested in reaching isolated peoples, indigenous groups that, unlike the Mayoruna, have little or no contact with the societies that surround them. Worldwide, 100 probably exist today, says Survival International, an ngo. The largest concentration, of perhaps 16, is in the Javari valley.
They owe their survival to a decision by Brazil's government in 1988. It discourages contact with isolated tribes, except to prevent medical emergencies, warfare between tribes or other catastrophes. The policy's father is Sydney Possuelo, a revered sertanista, or explorer, who led contact missions for Brazil's military government in the 1970s and 1980s. Development projects like the construction of the TransAmazonian highway cleaved through forest inhabited by scores of indigenous groups (see map on next page). In some, 50-90% of their members died from diseases like measles and flu. Horrified, Mr Possuelo persuaded the government to adopt the no-contact policy. It has become a model for other countries in the region.
From the start, it encountered resistance, chiefly from people who want to farm and mine on indigenous land. Now, for the first time, Brazil has a president, Jair Bolsonaro, who is a critic of the policy. An evangelical Christian, he shares the proselytising zeal of the missionaries whom Mr Mayoruna has encountered. He is also sympathetic to businessmen who want to develop the Amazon. Though still on the books, in practice the no-contact policy is being dismantled.
One of Mr Bolsonaro's first decrees transferred power to demarcate indigenous reserves from the indigenous agency (funai) to the agriculture ministry, which is friendlier to farmers. The Supreme Court annulled it. This year he nominated Ricardo Lopes Dias, a former missionary, to oversee the part of funai that deals with its policy on isolated tribes. Mr Possuelo says that Mr Bolsonaro poses the biggest threat to those groups since the no-contact policy began. ""Contact is a road of no return,"" he says. The alarm is heightened by covid-19, which could hurt indigenous people more than those with access to modern health care. Mr Bolsonaro, who revealed this week that he had tested positive for the coronavirus, has shown little interest in shielding Brazilians from it.
Even before his presidency, the no-contact policy was under threat. Between 1987 and 2013, funai contacted only five isolated groups. But illegal logging, mining and drug smuggling have pushed non-isolated groups towards isolated ones. Tensions between them have drawn in the state. funai has led as many contact missions since 2014 as it did in those previous 26 years. In 2015 it drew criticism for initially ignoring pleas from the Matis in the Javari valley to make contact with the isolated Korubo, whose members had killed two Matis leaders. funai contacted the Korubo only after the Matis killed eight Korubo in revenge.
With Mr Bolsonaro in charge, religious pressures reinforce commercial ones. ""I haven't met an Indian who wants to be naked, and it's a crime to keep them that way,"" says an American missionary who lives in Atalaia do Norte. Edward Luz, the president of the New Tribes Mission of Brazil (mntb), whose 480 missionaries evangelise ""unreached ethnic groups"", wrote in an email to The Economist that contact will improve their health. Fear and worry ""will be replaced by confidence and they will smile, procreate, have their cultural practices and grow in numbers again,"" he prophesied.
Mr Lopes was once an mntb missionary. His appointment to funai is like ""putting a fox in charge of the hen house"", says Beto Marubo, an indigenous activist. He fears that Mr Lopes will share secret information about tribes' locations with proselytising friends. If contact is needed, it should be done by the government, not missionaries, said Mr Lopes in an email.
Missionaries deny that they are trying to contact isolated tribes. Their actions suggest otherwise. Ethnos360, the American partner of mntb, raised more than $2m to buy a helicopter to ""open the door to reach ten additional people groups living in extreme isolation"" in the Javari valley. Mr Luz says the helicopter, which arrived in January, will help mntb in areas where it already works, like Vida Nova, a Marubo village where it built a church in the 1950s. funai has reported Andrew Tonkin, an American, to the police for flying a seaplane into the Javari valley. Indigenous leaders say he was searching for isolated groups. He denies this and denounces what he sees as funai's paternalism. ""What about [indigenous peoples'] right to invite who they want to their community?"" he emailed. ""To worship God freely?""
It is not just missionaries and miners who challenge the no-contact policy. In an editorial in Science in 2015, two anthropologists, Kim Hill and Robert Walker, suggested that, given governments' inability to protect indigenous lands, isolated groups are ""not viable in the long term"". ""Controlled contact"" would be a better policy, they wrote. ""If we can guarantee them protection from exploitation they would all choose contact tomorrow,"" says Mr Hill. His research shows that by at least one measure they would be better off: among the Ache of Paraguay, half of children living isolated in the forest died before reaching adulthood. After contact in the 1970s, child mortality rates spiked for a few years, but are now 2-3%.
The Science article caused a furore. The idea of controlled contact ignores native peoples' right to self-determination, say defenders of no contact. Many groups returned to isolation after traumatic encounters, such as enslavement by rubber tappers in the early 1900s. Uncontacted groups ""know there's a world out there,"" says Mr Marubo. ""They are making a choice by isolating themselves."" Many people doubt that any contact could be controlled, and that it would be accompanied by medical follow-up. ""Can you trust that a government won't think about what gold is there, what oil is there, what trees are there?"" asks Glenn Shepard, an ethnobotanist.
Even if controlled contact were possible, now seems a bad time to initiate it. The prevalence of covid-19 among indigenous people in cities is five times that among white Brazilians. Mr Hill agrees contact should not happen until there is a vaccine and Mr Bolsonaro is no longer president.
Yet evangelists see the disease as a reason to initiate it. Congress's evangelical lobby tacked on to a law that allocates money to protect indigenous people from covid-19 an amendment that allows missionaries to remain on indigenous lands. After a court ordered the government to evict 20,000 gold miners from the remote Yanomami territory, the army dropped off face masks and hydroxychloroquine, an antimalarial drug that Mr Bolsonaro thinks is effective against covid-19.
Mr Mayoruna, who left the forest because ""I wanted to know who God was"", recently broke ties with the missionaries. He thinks it is a matter of time before the remaining isolated groups are confronted with modern Brazil, but says it is wrong for pastors to push the pace. ""You can't force anyone to convert,"" he says.","Brazil

DUBAI, JOHANNESBURG, SINGAPORE, SYDNEY, TOKYO AND WASHINGTON, DC
Covid-19 has frozen global migration. When the pandemic recedes, how many barriers will remain?
Every weekend the removal vans come to a leafy suburb of Dubai. Expatriates are packing up. The United Arab Emirates (uae), of which Dubai is part, will lose 10% of its population this year, reckons Nasser al-Shaikh, an ex-finance minister. Covid-19 has devastated the Gulf's trade-and-transport hub. Emirates, Dubai's airline, says it may cut 30% of its roughly 100,000 staff.
Nearly all of those losing their jobs in the uae are migrants, who are almost 90% of the population. Without a job, they have to leave the country. This is irksome enough if they are bankers or architects. For those who used to wash dishes in hotels or lay bricks on building sites that are now shuttered, it can be a nightmare. Some 500,000 Indians in the uae have registered to be evacuated; less than half have been.
Many blue-collar migrants have waited so long for flights that they have blown their savings. Asad (not his real name) got a $1,100 pay-off when he lost his construction job in April, but has had to spend nearly all of it on food and other necessities, which are far costlier in Dubai than back home in Pakistan. This week he was huddling outside the airport for a cigarette before a flight to Lahore. ""Two years [and] I go home with almost nothing,"" he says. Some of his friends are even worse off: they still owe money to the labour brokers who brought them to the Gulf in the first place.
Covid-19 has immobilised the world. Planes are grounded, borders are closed, people are hunkered down at home. Every country has restricted travel because of the coronavirus-issuing more than 65,000 rules in total. Some countries are starting to open up but it will be a long time before people can globetrot as freely as before.
For tourists who have to take a domestic holiday instead of a glamorous foreign one, global immobility is annoying. For would-be migrants, it can be life-shattering. Millions who would have set off to start a new life this year cannot. Workers who might have quadrupled their wages will remain poor. Students who might have stretched their minds on foreign campuses will stay at home.
Tens of millions of migrants who have already moved now face deportation, having lost their job, according to the International Labour Organisation. Millions have gone home to places like the Philippines, India and Ukraine. Millions more are stranded, sometimes in crowded conditions that foster the spread of the virus.
Locals are not always sympathetic. Malaysia, which used to welcome Muslim Rohingya refugees, has started pushing their vessels back into the sea. Italy has stepped up efforts to turn back boatloads of Africans. A Kuwaiti actress suggested that migrant workers, who are 70% of the labour force in Kuwait, be thrown into the desert to free up space in hospitals.
Global remittance flows, which are over three times bigger than foreign aid to poor countries, will fall by 20% this year, predicts the World Bank. Families that used to rely on cash from a migrant son or aunt to see them through hard times are finding that times are suddenly much harder and the flow of cash from abroad has dried up.
Businesses that depend on mobile labour have been hobbled. Pokka Singapore, a drinks-maker, employs about 120 Malaysians who used to commute across the border to Singapore. When the borders closed, more than half decided to remain in Malaysia, says Rieko Shofu, the firm's boss. She has gone without half her Malaysian workforce for months, with no end in sight.
Travel curbs have made cross-border investment harder. Before committing money to a venture, you need to be ""able to walk the factory floor"" and ""physically validate what you read in the PowerPoint presentation,"" says Stephen Forshaw of Temasek, Singapore's sovereign-wealth fund. Now, if you are not already there, you can't.
Even if tourism and business travel return to something resembling normal as the pandemic fades, some restrictions on migration may remain. Where people had a settled right to move which was temporarily suspended for health reasons, within the European Union for example, that right will surely be restored. But where permission to move is granted by the host government, it may become permanently harder.
Much will depend on how covid-19 affects people's view of immigrants. Fear could make them more hostile. Many will conclude that letting in foreigners is a health risk (though the vast majority of travellers are not migrants). Because the virus originated in China, bigots in many countries have mistreated people who look Chinese. Bigots in China, meanwhile, have evicted black immigrants from their homes and barred them from hotels, after hearing a rumour that Africans were likely to be infected. Future migrants will not quickly forget footage of a no-blacks sign on a McDonald's in Guangzhou.
With economies reeling, many will also conclude that it is time to stop immigrants from competing with natives for scarce jobs. In countries where lots of migrants have been laid off and are allowed to live on the dole, locals may resent the expense.
The pandemic might also hurt illicit migrants. Some of the snooping tools that governments have introduced to trace the spread of covid-19 could outlast it, making it harder to work in the shadows. In China, to take the most extreme example, malls and subways often deny entry to those who lack an app on their phone to show they are healthy, which no one can get without a formal address. ""It may become virtually impossible to live without papers,"" writes Roberto Castillo of AfricansInChina.net.
In other ways, however, the pandemic could make people friendlier towards immigrants, many of whom have risked their lives to do essential work during the crisis (see chart 1). Health services in rich countries could not function without them (see chart 2). Roughly half the doctors in Australia and Israel are foreign-born. In America migrants were 14% of the population in 2018 but 29% of doctors. Medical research, of the sort that will one day yield a vaccine, depends on teams of the most talented minds from around the world getting together and collaborating. Some 40% of medical and life scientists in America are foreign-born. The Oxford Vaccine Group, which unveiled promising vaccine trial results in July, includes scientists from practically everywhere.
Immigrants also do a big share of the jobs that ""make it possible for the rest of us to work safely from home,"" observes Doris Meissner of the Migration Policy Institute, a think-tank. They grow food (42% of farm workers in America are foreign-born), deliver things (18% of industrial truckers) and disinfect floors (47% of hotel maids and 25% of janitors). More than half of American tech giants were founded by immigrants or their children. That includes Zoom, Amazon and Google, without whose products remote working would be tricky.
With covid-19 rife, immigration policy is not at the top of the agenda anywhere. But it is bubbling up. Europe seems more hostile to migrants crossing the Mediterranean. In Australia the opposition Labor Party's immigration spokeswoman said the country should move away from its ""lazy"" reliance on ""cheap"" foreign workers who take ""jobs Australians could do"".
Among rich countries the debate is playing out most dramatically in America. Long before covid-19 was discovered, Mr Trump associated immigrants with germs. He spoke of ""tremendous infectious disease...pouring across the border"" with Mexico. Stephen Miller, a hardline adviser, had long argued that public health could provide a legal justification for shutting them out. After the coronavirus struck, Mr Trump enacted a wishlist of restrictions.
He banned foreign travellers from China. This did not protect America since Americans were free to return home from covid-19 hotspots. Nonetheless, Mr Trump praised his own decisiveness. ""I banned China,"" he repeated, often.
Immigration to the United States was falling even before the pandemic, thanks to aggressive enforcement, reduced quotas and the eloquence with which Mr Trump tells migrants they are not wanted. The net increase in the foreign-born population was a mere 200,000 in 2017-18, down from over 1m in 2013-14. Mr Trump seems eager to lower that number to zero.
In June he issued a ""Proclamation Suspending Entry of Aliens Who Present a Risk to the us Labour Market Following the Coronavirus Outbreak"". It froze four types of visa for the rest of the year: h-1bs (for highly skilled workers); h-2bs (for lessskilled workers); j visas, for au pairs, temporary summer workers and some academics; and l visas, for professionals who are moved within the same company.
With every word, they drop knowledge
These new rules, combined with a neartotal shutdown of visa offices, will destroy American jobs, not create them. Holders of h-1B visas mostly work in information technology, where there is a skills shortage. Adam Ozimek of Upwork, a freelancing platform, estimates that the use of it to enable remote working has reduced the risk of job losses by between a third and a half. And a new paper by Britta Glennon of the Wharton School finds that when America restricts h-1B visas, multinationals do not hire more Americans. They shift operations to Canada, India and China.
Curbing the flow of talent will constrict economic growth. Consider the baffling decision to stop intra-company transfers. Multinationals routinely bring in key managers or technicians from abroad to solve bottlenecks. If they cannot do this, their businesses are less likely to succeed-so they will be less likely to invest in America at all. ""About 80% of my portfolio consists of at least one founder who has immigrant roots,"" says Joydeep Bhattacharyya, a venture capitalist in Silicon Valley. ""Many have started outside the United States, and then the entrepreneur has moved over, employ- ing a lot of American workers. This year it's completely stopped. No matter how well they're doing, they can't come.""
Banning au pairs won't create jobs for Americans, either. On the contrary: by providing cheap child care, au pairs make it easier for American parents to go out to work. Families that couldn't afford a nanny can often afford an au pair because part of the au pair's compensation is a place to stay and a chance to learn English.
Jason Patwell, a defence contractor, is a single father of three boys, one of whom has special needs. He was aghast when he realised that an au pair would not be coming. ""I would love to say I have a back-up plan, but I don't. I can throw money at the problem, and go into debt. I'll survive until the end of the summer,"" he says.
In worse-off countries, where the state lacks the cash to cushion the economic shock of covid-19, the debate about migration is even more fraught. Consider South Africa, where xenophobia was common, sometimes lethally so, even before the pandemic. Like America, South Africa shares a long, porous land border with a large continent where wages are much lower. Workers and traders flock there from all over Africa. The World Bank estimates that each one creates on average two jobs for natives, because migrants import skills, start businesses and spend money. But most South Africans think otherwise. They are nearly twice as likely to say that immigrants are a burden than to say they make the country stronger, says a Pew poll. (In America, those figures are reversed.)
One of the first things South Africa's government did to fight covid-19 was to build a 40km fence on the border with Zimbabwe. It has more holes than a bagel warehouse. A local farmer calls it ""a complete farce"". It would not be much of a publichealth measure in any case. Covid-19 has largely entered South Africa by air, from Europe, and is circulating widely.
In March a minister announced that foreign-owned shops, which are the only outlets in many areas and are disproportionally owned by Ethiopians and Somalis, would have to close. Locals were forced to travel miles to buy groceries, which helped spread the virus. Enforcement was relaxed in April, but the hassles did not end.
When the offices that issue permits were closed, the government promised that all expiring permits would automatically be extended, first until July 31st, then until October 31st. However, police and soldiers have allegedly detained and demanded bribes from foreigners with out-of-date papers. A few Zimbabweans got on privately organised repatriation buses. Upon leaving South Africa, some were banned from returning for five years, despite promises to the contrary. An overhaul of immigration laws is due later this year-to be drafted by securocrats, not economists.
Some countries may emerge from the pandemic more open to migration. In Japan covid-19 may have spurred the government to make its pro-immigration policies more explicit. The country is ageing and needs young foreigners to clean hotels and staff shops. The polite fiction was that many of these foreign workers were ""trainees"", learning skills to bring back home.
Got a lot farther by working a lot harder
But from April the government ditched the requirement that these ""trainees"" stick with the firm that sponsored their visa. It did not want to deport migrants who had lost jobs in one sector (eg hotels) when others (eg hospitals) were crying out for them. So it announced that they could switch employers. By doing so, it has dropped the pretence that the trainee programme is about anything more than coping with Japan's own labour shortage, argues Menju Toshihiro of the Japan Centre for International Exchange, a non-profit. Indeed, migrant workers are so valuable that calls to exclude them from the government's covid-19 stimulus package fell on deaf ears.
In Britain anti-immigration sentiment peaked around the time of the Brexit referendum of 2016, but has since subsided. Many who voted to leave the eu because they thought there was too much migration now feel Britain has taken back control of its borders. In the wake of covid-19, views of immigration will continue to mollify, predicts Jonathan Portes of King's College London. A recent decision to extend residence rights to up to 3m Hong Kongers passed without fuss. Under a proposed points-based system, eu nationals will find it harder to work in the uk, and few workers from anywhere will be admitted if they make less than £25,600 ($33,231) a year. But the rules will be looser for health workers. And voters have noticed that many migrants who make less than £25,600 have been indispensable of late. ""Care workers, bus drivers and supermarket staff all fulfil essential functions, and it is far from obvious that there will be public support for an immigration system that excludes them all in favour of relatively junior bankers,"" writes Mr Portes.
In America, for all Mr Trump's fist-waving, the share of people who think that illegal immigration is a ""very big problem"" has fallen markedly since the pandemic began, from 43% last year to 28% in June. This could be because the influx has dried up, or because, compared with covid-19 itself, nothing seems like a ""very big problem"". The country is divided. A new Economist/ YouGov poll finds Americans roughly evenly split between wanting immigration to resume after the pandemic at the same pace as before or faster (40%) versus slower or remaining frozen (42%).
Still, the inability of populist leaders such as Mr Trump and Brazil's Jair Bolsonaro to cope with covid-19 could cost them their jobs-and thereby usher in a less drawbridge-up type of government. The Economist's prediction model gives Joe Biden about a nine-in-ten chance of winning the American presidency in November. He would clearly be different. He says ""Trump has waged an unrelenting assault on our values and our history as a nation of immigrants."" He could immediately revoke Mr Trump's executive orders and stop separating migrant children from their parents. He vows to promote laws to increase the number of skilled migrants, create an easier path to citizenship and let cities with labour shortages petition for more migrants.
Covid-19 has shown that the freedom to migrate, which was always constrained, can be cancelled at will when people are scared. Consider Subha Nawer Pushpita's experiences. She is a Bangladeshi studying computer science at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. America was built by people like her: immigrants at mit have won more Nobel prizes than China. So she was gobsmacked to learn, on July 6th, that she might be deported. The government said that foreigners at American universities who take only remote classes would have to leave the country.
Eighteen states sued to have the rule scrapped. The week after, it was. ""I felt incredibly relieved and excited. I called my mom and I was shouting,"" recalls Ms Pushpita. She will be able to study. But many others won't. On July 24th the Trump administration said that new foreign students who have not yet reached America will be barred if their classes are taught remotely. ""As long as he's in office, something else will pop up,"" sighs Ms Pushpita.","Migration after covid-19 
 DUBAI , JOHANNESBURG , SINGAPORE , SYDNEY , TOKYO AND WASHINGTON , DC 
 Covid-19 has frozen global migration . When the pandemic recedes , how many barriers will remain ? 
 Every weekend the removal vans come to a leafy suburb of Dubai . Expatriates are packing up . The United Arab Emirates ( uae ) , of which Dubai is part , will lose 10 % of its population this year , reckons Nasser al - Shaikh , an ex - finance minister . Covid-19 has devastated the Gulf 's trade - and - transport hub . Emirates , Dubai 's airline , says it may cut 30 % of its roughly 100,000 staff . 
 Nearly all of those losing their jobs in the uae are migrants , who are almost 90 % of the population . Without a job , they have to leave the country . This is irksome enough if they are bankers or architects . For those who used to wash dishes in hotels or lay bricks on building sites that are now shuttered , it can be a nightmare . Some 500,000 Indians in the uae have registered to be evacuated ; less than half have been . 
 Many blue - collar migrants have waited so long for flights that they have blown their savings . Asad ( not his real name ) got a $ 1,100 pay - off when he lost his construction job in April , but has had to spend nearly all of it on food and other necessities , which are far costlier in Dubai than back home in Pakistan . This week he was huddling outside the airport for a cigarette before a flight to Lahore . "" Two years [ and ] I go home with almost nothing , "" he says . Some of his friends are even worse off : they still owe money to the labour brokers who brought them to the Gulf in the first place . 
 Covid-19 has immobilised the world . Planes are grounded , borders are closed , people are hunkered down at home . Every country has restricted travel because of the coronavirus - issuing more than 65,000 rules in total . Some countries are starting to open up but it will be a long time before people can globetrot as freely as before . 
 For tourists who have to take a domestic holiday instead of a glamorous foreign one , global immobility is annoying . For would - be migrants , it can be life - shattering . Millions who would have set off to start a new life this year can not . Workers who might have quadrupled their wages will remain poor . Students who might have stretched their minds on foreign campuses will stay at home . 
 Tens of millions of migrants who have already moved now face deportation , having lost their job , according to the International Labour Organisation . Millions have gone home to places like the Philippines , India and Ukraine . Millions more are stranded , sometimes in crowded conditions that foster the spread of the virus . 
 Locals are not always sympathetic . Malaysia , which used to welcome Muslim Rohingya refugees , has started pushing their vessels back into the sea . Italy has stepped up efforts to turn back boatloads of Africans . A Kuwaiti actress suggested that migrant workers , who are 70 % of the labour force in Kuwait , be thrown into the desert to free up space in hospitals . 
 Global remittance flows , which are over three times bigger than foreign aid to poor countries , will fall by 20 % this year , predicts the World Bank . Families that used to rely on cash from a migrant son or aunt to see them through hard times are finding that times are suddenly much harder and the flow of cash from abroad has dried up . 
 Businesses that depend on mobile labour have been hobbled . Pokka Singapore , a drinks - maker , employs about 120 Malaysians who used to commute across the border to Singapore . When the borders closed , more than half decided to remain in Malaysia , says Rieko Shofu , the firm 's boss . She has gone without half her Malaysian workforce for months , with no end in sight . 
 Travel curbs have made cross - border investment harder . Before committing money to a venture , you need to be "" able to walk the factory floor "" and "" physically validate what you read in the PowerPoint presentation , "" says Stephen Forshaw of Temasek , Singapore 's sovereign - wealth fund . Now , if you are not already there , you ca n't . 
 Even if tourism and business travel return to something resembling normal as the pandemic fades , some restrictions on migration may remain . Where people had a settled right to move which was temporarily suspended for health reasons , within the European Union for example , that right will surely be restored . But where permission to move is granted by the host government , it may become permanently harder . 
 Much will depend on how covid-19 affects people 's view of immigrants . Fear could make them more hostile . Many will conclude that letting in foreigners is a health risk ( though the vast majority of travellers are not migrants ) . Because the virus originated in China , bigots in many countries have mistreated people who look Chinese . Bigots in China , meanwhile , have evicted black immigrants from their homes and barred them from hotels , after hearing a rumour that Africans were likely to be infected . Future migrants will not quickly forget footage of a no - blacks sign on a McDonald 's in Guangzhou . 
 With economies reeling , many will also conclude that it is time to stop immigrants from competing with natives for scarce jobs . In countries where lots of migrants have been laid off and are allowed to live on the dole , locals may resent the expense . 
 The pandemic might also hurt illicit migrants . Some of the snooping tools that governments have introduced to trace the spread of covid-19 could outlast it , making it harder to work in the shadows . In China , to take the most extreme example , malls and subways often deny entry to those who lack an app on their phone to show they are healthy , which no one can get without a formal address . "" It may become virtually impossible to live without papers , "" writes Roberto Castillo of AfricansInChina.net . 
 In other ways , however , the pandemic could make people friendlier towards immigrants , many of whom have risked their lives to do essential work during the crisis ( see chart 1 ) . Health services in rich countries could not function without them ( see chart 2 ) . Roughly half the doctors in Australia and Israel are foreign - born . In America migrants were 14 % of the population in 2018 but 29 % of doctors . Medical research , of the sort that will one day yield a vaccine , depends on teams of the most talented minds from around the world getting together and collaborating . Some 40 % of medical and life scientists in America are foreign - born . The Oxford Vaccine Group , which unveiled promising vaccine trial results in July , includes scientists from practically everywhere . 
 Immigrants also do a big share of the jobs that "" make it possible for the rest of us to work safely from home , "" observes Doris Meissner of the Migration Policy Institute , a think - tank . They grow food ( 42 % of farm workers in America are foreign - born ) , deliver things ( 18 % of industrial truckers ) and disinfect floors ( 47 % of hotel maids and 25 % of janitors ) . More than half of American tech giants were founded by immigrants or their children . That includes Zoom , Amazon and Google , without whose products remote working would be tricky . 
 With covid-19 rife , immigration policy is not at the top of the agenda anywhere . But it is bubbling up . Europe seems more hostile to migrants crossing the Mediterranean . In Australia the opposition Labor Party 's immigration spokeswoman said the country should move away from its "" lazy "" reliance on "" cheap "" foreign workers who take "" jobs Australians could do "" . 
 Among rich countries the debate is playing out most dramatically in America . Long before covid-19 was discovered , Mr Trump associated immigrants with germs . He spoke of "" tremendous infectious disease ... pouring across the border "" with Mexico . Stephen Miller , a hardline adviser , had long argued that public health could provide a legal justification for shutting them out . After the coronavirus struck , Mr Trump enacted a wishlist of restrictions . 
 He banned foreign travellers from China . This did not protect America since Americans were free to return home from covid-19 hotspots . Nonetheless , Mr Trump praised his own decisiveness . "" I banned China , "" he repeated , often .

""For the first time in history, you can truly envision a western hemisphere that is secure, democratic and middle-class, from northern Canada to southern Chile, and everywhere in between."" So said Joe Biden in a speech at Harvard University in 2014. Much has changed since then, not least the destruction of lives and livelihoods wrought by the pandemic. Even so, were Mr Biden to be elected president of the United States in November, for many Latin Americans he would offer a vision that is reassuring and familiar compared with the unpredictable sound and fury of Donald Trump.
Mr Trump won in 2016 in part because he promised to build a wall to keep out Latin American immigrants, declaring that Mexico was ""not our friend"". Nevertheless, he has developed relatively good relations with the most important governments in the region. Jair Bolsonaro, Brazil's president, used Mr Trump's success as a template for his own campaign in 2018. He has closely aligned Brazil's foreign policy, normally independent, with the Trump administration's views. Andrés Manuel López Obrador, on his only foreign trip in 21 months as Mexico's leader, last month went to Washington and praised Mr Trump's ""kindness and respect"". To keep the border open for trade, Mexico's government has collaborated in shutting it to asylum-seekers.
Wary of Mr Trump's threats of tariffs and sanctions, many governments have fallen into line ""out of necessity and especially out of fear"", says a Latin American official. Ordinary Latin Americans are not impressed: the percentage who express a favourable view of the United States fell from the high 60s in 2015 to around 45 in 2017, according to the Pew Research Centre.
Mr Trump's Latin American policy has centred on a (so far) failed bid to overthrow what John Bolton, his former national security adviser, called ""the troika of tyranny""-the leftist dictatorships in Venezuela, Cuba and Nicaragua. In his recent memoir Mr Bolton blamed the failure to oust Nicolás Maduro in Venezuela, despite swingeing sanctions, on Mr Trump's lack of constancy and foot-dragging inside the administration. As important, the administration underestimated the difficulty of prising the army away from Mr Maduro. Its critics say its Latin American policies are based on the president's need to win Florida, home to large Cuban and Venezuelan diasporas, in November. ""Domestic politics always figures in policy towards Latin America, but never before to this degree,"" says Michael Shifter of Inter-American Dialogue, a think-tank in Washington.
Were Mr Biden to win, his priorities would be the American economy and dealing with China. But Latin America might not be at the bottom of his to-do list. He knows the region far better than recent presidents. In Barack Obama's second term Vice-President Biden took on responsibility for the Americas. ""He dedicated time to it, set out to learn about it and talked to a lot of people in the region,"" says the Latin American official.
Juan Gonzalez, who advised Mr Biden on Latin America back then, stresses that the region and the world are not as they were in 2016. ""The challenges are much greater,"" he says. But he thinks there are opportunities for the United States in the region, not just threats to be managed. American firms that bring supply chains back from China could benefit Mexico and Central America. Mr Biden has long supported immigration reform. As president, he would be likely to resume his previous policy in Central America, with an aid programme aimed at fighting corruption and deterring migration through economic development.
On Venezuela, Mr Gonzalez says that sanctions should be part of a broader policy that would include seeking negotiations for free elections. A Biden presidency would revert to Mr Obama's Cuba policy, which saw engagement as more likely to weaken the communist regime than Mr Trump's intensification of sanctions. It would press Mr Bolsonaro on his failure to protect the Amazon.
An immediate issue concerns leadership of the Inter-American Development Bank. Breaking with a 60-year understanding that its president is a Latin American, the Trump administration wants the job for Mauricio Claver-Carone, an official at the National Security Council and an architect of its Venezuela policy. He may get it at a meeting of the bank's governors next month. A Biden administration would probably force him out in favour of a less polarising figure. To do that, Mr Biden must win.","A Biden presidency might seem reassuringly familiar to Latin Americans

Covid-19 is forcing the world to confront a new form of collective trauma
The nightmare began in earnest for residents of Parque das Tribos when their cacique, or local chief, died of covid-19. Messias Kokama had battled politicians, developers and drug gangs to transform a dusty informal settlement on the outskirts of Manaus, a city of 2m people deep in the Brazilian Amazon, into a haven for some 600 indigenous families from 35 ethnic groups. He was 53 and said he wasn't afraid of the virus. His death on May 13th shook the community.
By then, hospitals in Manaus were turning people away and cemeteries were digging mass graves. Ambulances wouldn't come to Parque das Tribos (""Tribes Park) because the city and the federal indigenous agency each claimed that indigenous city-dwellers fell to the other institution. Such neglect exacerbated their grief. Every few days another elder would start gasping for air. Those who made it back from hospital told horror stories of frigid wards packed with dying patients and doctors who didn't speak their language. One resident fled the icu. ""He said he would rather die in a hammock than surrounded by tubes, said his daughter-in-law, Cláudia Baré. Five weeks later, he did.
The pandemic has now subsided in Parque das Tribos. Burials in Manaus have fallen from more than 150 per day to the prepandemic norm of around 35. Sunbathers once again pack Ponta Negra beach on the banks of the Rio Negro. It scarcely seems imaginable that just two months ago, boats were arriving at the port with covid-19 patients who had died on the journey. Yet the chaos of the past few months is giving way to a second crisis. Lingering trauma and continued hardship will take much longer to overcome. Mr Kokama's daughter, Mirian, is being treated for depression. His son, Miqueias, who is 33 and took over as chief, barely sleeps.
For some, the second half of 2020 will bring much-needed relief. For the time being the number of new recorded global infections has plateaued. In many countries it has dropped dramatically. Yet for those places hit hardest, a full recovery will depend on more than getting the virus under control. In a world paralysed by death, survivors are everywhere: icu patients who faced the horror of covid-19 first-hand, doctors and nurses who cared for them, relatives forced to mourn over WhatsApp and Zoom, families who lost their livelihoods. Mental-health professionals say that no single event since the second world war has left so many people in so many places traumatised at once. How people fare in the months and years ahead will depend partly on how their countries-and, more importantly, their communities-respond.
Stress en masse
In 1972 a dam burst at a coal mine in West Virginia and 132m gallons of sludge ripped through the Buffalo Creek valley, killing 125 people and destroying thousands of homes. The victims' lawyers hired Kai Erikson, a sociologist, to study the aftermath of the flood. It had swept away not only physical belongings, but also relationships, routines, tradition and trust. He called this devastation ""collective trauma.
The way Mr Erikson saw it, traumatic experiences harm individuals, of course. But they can also change group dynamics. People stop trusting each other. It becomes harder to bring people back together and easier to open new wounds. If nothing is done, this can permanently damage a society-and even destroy it. In Buffalo Creek untreated grief and neglect en masse led to the demise of several towns.
Though the term may have been new, the experience of collective trauma was not. Mass trauma has now been identified in the context of wars, natural disasters and terrorist attacks. Research shows that people and communities are typically very resilient. Yet exposure to death puts them at greater risk of lasting affliction. Violence and disasters owing to negligence-such as the Buffalo Creek flood or the explosion on August 4th at a warehouse in Beirut that killed some 150 people-are more likely to lead to trauma than ""acts of God"" such as hurricanes or earthquakes.
Pandemics do not fall neatly into either category. During the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (sars) outbreak in Hong Kong in 2003, nearly 40% of the population experienced increased stress, 16% showed signs of trauma and only 25% believed they were very likely to survive if they contracted the disease even though the death rate was around 10% of people infected. A review of studies involving patients treated for sars found that a third went on to develop symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder (ptsd), a condition that can result in vivid flashbacks and difficulty sleeping. But past epidemics are imperfect proxies for covid-19. Its unprecedented reach across the globe and into nearly every aspect of life makes it more like a world war.
There were no large-scale psychological studies during the first or the second world wars, though the Holocaust would become the event most deeply associated with mass death and grief. Researchers in the early 2000s found roughly half of Holocaust survivors were still suffering from ptsd. Many had other disorders such as schizophrenia. Even among non-Jewish Europeans who were children during the war, 10-40% still had ptsd symptoms. In communities of survivors, research has shown that ""inherited trauma"" can be passed to subsequent generations, by growing up flooded with their parents' memories, and possibly, through genes.
The suffering caused by covid-19 falls far short of the horrors of the Holocaust. Still, Krzysztof Kaniasty, a psychologist and disaster expert, points out that the pandemic presents nearly all the risk factors for ptsd. It has caused sudden death, life-changing events, large-scale social ruptures and chronic stressors like uncertainty and the added hassles of daily life.
The luckiest will suffer mildly from one or two of these effects. Yet more than at any other point in recent history, millions of people have been slammed by all of them. In the first large-scale survey of a developed country struck by covid-19, published in July by Psychiatry Research, 29% of 15,530 Britons surveyed met the criteria for a general psychiatric disorder. In Spain, where a shortage of protective kit has meant nearly a sixth of all covid-19 infections are of health workers, more than half are showing signs of ptsd. Another study found 86% of Bangladeshis are dealing with covid-related stress, resulting in insomnia, irritability and family problems.
There are signs of hope. In the long run people fare better when they perceive strong social support in the aftermath of a catastrophe and worse when they feel neglected or excluded. ""Strong communities buffer against adverse traumatic effects,"" says Joshua Morganstein of the Uniformed Services University in Bethesda, Maryland. His studies of health workers in Florida after hurricanes in 2004 and 2005 found lower rates of ptsd and depression among those who reported living in places with tight-knit social circles, which are better able to organise in times of crisis.
Adverse learning conditions
On February 21st the first case of covid-19 in Italy was diagnosed at a small hospital in Codogno, a serene town with cobbled streets not far from the river Po. Its inhabitants were soon experiencing drama of a sort they had seen only in films. Roadblocks were thrown up around the newly declared ""red zone"" and residents besieged pharmacies for personal protective equipment (ppe), which quickly ran out. ""It was like being in a war with an invisible enemy,"" says Rosa Cavalli, whose family owns one of the pharmacies.
But within days, 100 people were working as volunteers at an operation centre run by Italy's disaster-response service. The struggling community radio station, which was renamed ""Red Zone Radio"", began putting out twice-daily bulletins to counter fake news and conspiracy theories. ""There was an initial moment of disorientation,"" says Nicoletta Porcu, a psychologist who formed part of a crisis group with colleagues. But the outpouring of support helped the town emerge strengthened from the trauma.
Mr Kaniasty, the professor, has found that ""received support"" that might come in the form of a donation is less important for psychological outcomes than ""perceived support"", the feeling that people can rely on their neighbours. As Codogno came out of lockdown in June, the degree of compliance with distancing rules-necessary for recovery-was astonishingly universal. The parish priest, Monsignor Iginio Passerini, was taken aback during confession to hear a young boy list among his sins that of having lowered his face mask outdoors.
Mass tragedies can teach groups of people how to avoid or mitigate them in future. Such ""adversarial growth"" helps explain why commuters in Hong Kong wore masks before any covid-19 cases had been reported. Most credit the territory's scarring experience with sars, which included tragic mistakes. But it also raised the profile of doctors. A record number of students applied to study medicine. The government added isolation wards in hospitals, trained infection specialists and stockpiled ppe.
Such investments paid off this year. Not a single covid-19 death was reported among Hong Kong's hospital workers. The response earned the unpopular government a ratings boost, but a controversial security law has undermined public trust and may compromise its mass-testing strategy.
Covid-19 is easier to deal with than some traumas. It moves more slowly and is more dispersed than a natural disaster, buying governments time. Unlike a war or a terrorist attack, there is no direct human enemy to blame. Some find comfort in the fact that the whole world is going through hardship at once. When Wayne Bai, a worker at a telecoms company in Wuhan, made a business trip the day after the city's lockdown lifted, he was denied a room at seven hotels. But his annoyance faded as the virus spread across the globe.
This universality has drawbacks, of course. One is that poor countries cannot turn as readily to rich ones for money or supplies. Aid workers who usually arrive after disasters would have been welcome in Guayaquil, Ecuador, where funeral services collapsed in late March, leading to a pile-up of bodies in homes. Zaida Rovira of the public ombudsman's office recalls trying to console a 70-year-old who had spent four days with his brother's body in the room they shared. At the Guasmo hospital, relatives had to enter refrigerated containers to look through hundreds of unlabelled corpses. More than 70 remain unidentified. Only recently did staff start collecting
dna samples after admitting sending photos of the bodies to relatives on WhatsApp may have led to misidentification.
Guayaquil, a tropical business hub of 2.7m people, is still counting the dead. They may top 10,000, which would give it one of the highest death rates of any big city. Yet it disappeared from headlines in April and has had to deal with its trauma alone. Most family members have received no psychological support. This points to yet another important characteristic of covid-19-its mental-health burden falls unequally in different parts of the world.
This exacerbates suffering in areas that failed to implement lessons from prior traumas. Parts of New Orleans where black people died of covid-19 at rates two to three times higher than white people were the same areas ravaged by Hurricane Katrina in 2005. Then, racist housing policies had herded minorities into low-lying areas. Now, a higher share of minorities work in front-line jobs cleaning hospitals or stocking shelves. They also have more underlying health problems like diabetes, often caused by poor access to primary care.
The remains of the pain
Good leadership can bring people together in a crisis. Polarising leadership has the opposite effect. In Brazil President Jair Bolsonaro has echoed his American counterpart's claim that the economic fallout of covid-19 is a greater trauma than the death toll. In both countries social distancing is a political statement. Even when hospitals were full in Manaus, less than half of people stayed at home. The local governor tried to cast himself as responsible, but people stopped trusting him after his health secretary was arrested on charges of embezzlement tied to a fake respirator company, which she denies. Corruption was more blatant in Guayaquil. The ombudsman's office is investigating reports that morgue staffers demanded $700 from relatives to return bodies, though most family members are too traumatised to sue.
Chaos at the top makes it harder to grapple with a harsh reality. Some stop believing altogether. Psychologists who set up a hotline in Manaus were surprised to discover that even callers who had lost relatives downplayed the virus's role, claiming other ailments ultimately killed them. Many believe online conspiracy theories, such as one claiming the state had exaggerated the death toll to receive more federal money and another alleging that the coffins buried in mass graves were filled with rocks. Sônia Lemos, who ran the hotline, said locals were going through collective denial. ""It's a defence mechanism that saves people from feeling responsible.""
There is a danger that political divisions, social distancing and economic woes will over time lead to a loss of togetherness in the same way that displacement after the Buffalo Creek flood gave ""a degree of permanence to what might otherwise have been a transitional state of shock"", in the words of Mr Erikson. Communities cannot grieve together because the disaster is ongoing and the threat has yet to disappear, says Judith Lewis Herman, a psychiatry professor at Harvard Medical School. She describes three stages of healing: re-establishing safety, remembrance and mourning, and reconnecting with others. Social distancing complicates all of them.
And so like the pandemic itself, the psychological fallout will require assessment and adaptation. Many doctors are still focused on saving lives, but governments and mental-health professionals should start thinking about ""psycho-social"" interventions. In France ""medical and psychological emergency units"" offer one model. They were launched to respond to mentalhealth concerns after a terrorist attack in 1995. People are offered psychological support immediately, near the scene, just as they would be offered paramedical services. Four years after 86 people were killed in Nice in a terrorist attack, the city has broadly returned to normal, says Frédéric Jover, the psychiatrist then running the unit. But empty streets this spring brought back ghastly memories. Nice reactivated its unit to help people struggling with bereavement, anxiety and isolation.
The fact that covid-19 is slower than a bomb or a flood gives governments and ngos an opportunity to identify and deal with mental-health issues before it is too late. Fuelled by national protests against racism and police violence, advocacy groups in Louisiana are proposing policies for a ""racially and economically equitable"" covid-19 recovery. New York City's health department is hosting virtual town-hall meetings for African-Americans, including webinars about bereavement.
But it will not be easy to sustain the recent surge in community organising and mutual-aid networks (such as WhatsApp groups to bring groceries to old people) that have sprung up across the country. Fatigue and forgetting can lead social networks to deteriorate, says Sarah Lowe of the Yale School of Public Health. ""Often people are still recovering when resources are cut off."" One of her studies found that a year after Hurricane Sandy, which hit New York City in 2012, mental-health outcomes were similar across demographic groups. But two years on, the poor were faring worse.
Poor countries spend much less on mental-health services and their citizens have fewer resources to get help. So healing will have to come from the ground up. This will require the creation of spaces-physical or virtual-for people to come together. In Parque das Tribos Ms Baré organised a WhatsApp group to distribute food baskets. A local nurse used her free time to go door-to-door checking on covid-19 cases and eventually persuaded the city to send a mobile-health station. Mr Kokama's family petitioned the courts for permission to bring his body back for a 30-minute, closed-coffin ceremony.
His friends and neighbours gathered on a recent Sunday, the first time since the funeral, settling into lawn chairs to watch local dance groups perform to raise money on Facebook Live. ""This is still a cry for help,"" said Luciana Vasconcelos as she painted her friend's face red and black. She added that Parque das Tribos owes its existence to a kind of collective trauma: indigenous people leaving the forest for the city in search of a better life. A speaker boomed out traditional lyrics with modern beats, and a mobile phone on a tripod filmed the dancers, some in т-shirts, others in beads, all beaming with a stubborn sort of hope.","BEIJING , CODOGNO , HONG KONG , MANAUS , NEW YORK , PARIS AND QUITO

The president's pandemic spending unnerves the liberal economy minister
Jair bolsonaro, Brazil's president, ought to be in trouble. His is one of the countries worst affected by covid-19. It has had nearly 4m confirmed cases, second only to the number in the United States, and 123,780 known deaths. That is largely the president's fault. He has downplayed the pandemic, railed against lockdowns and promoted unproven cures.
A crusader against corruption before he became president, Mr Bolsonaro is surrounded by scandal. One of his sons is the target of a corruption investigation. The justice minister, Sérgio Moro, quit in April, accusing the president of interfering with the probe. And yet Mr Bolsonaro is gaining political strength. The share of Brazilians who deem his performance ""good"" or ""great"" is 37%, its highest since he took office at the beginning of last year, according to Datafolha, a pollster.
This is a side-effect of covid-19. While Mr Bolsonaro has done little to contain it, he has spent generously to shield poor Brazilians from its economic effects. At the same time, he has strengthened his weak position in Congress. His tiny Alliance for Brazil, formed last November, has teamed up with the centrāo, a big bloc of centreright parties. That will help the government pass legislation and, perhaps, shield him from impeachment. The centrāo is blocking 49 impeachment motions stemming from the scandals and the mishandling of the pandemic.
But as Mr Bolsonaro grows stronger, his commitment to keeping his promises becomes weaker. The alliance with the centrāo employs the grubby dealmaking that Mr Bolsonaro once denounced. Friends of centrāo politicians have got plum government jobs. Also in doubt is Mr Bolsonaro's pledge to reform the economy, which had encouraged some bankers and businessmen to overlook his authoritarian views.
Mr Bolsonaro, a former army captain, is not an economic reformer by instinct. Economic liberals have put their faith in Paulo Guedes, the economy minister (pictured left), who favours small government and free markets. He justified their confidence last year by helping to reform the pension system, whose lavish benefits would have led to crippling debt. But Mr Guedes is visibly uneasy about the spending provoked by the pandemic. In late August two of his top aides quit, prompting a fall in the stockmarket and pushing the real to its lowest level against the dollar since May.
Whatever happens to Mr Guedes, Mr Bolsonaro's presidency has entered a new phase. In its proneness to scandal, its cynical deal with Congress and its generosity to poor voters, it is coming to resemble past administrations. Mr Bolsonaro's government has ""some similarities"" to that of the left-wing Workers' Party (pt), which governed from 2003 to 2016, says Arminio Fraga, a former head of the central bank.
No one would have said that before the pandemic. The government had trimmed Bolsa Família, the pt's flagship welfare programme, which transfers cash to families that promise to send their children to school and to clinics for check-ups. Last year the Bolsonaro government cut the number of families enrolled by 1.2m to 13m.
With the pandemic the penny-pinching has stopped. The government has spent 213bn reais ($39bn), about 2% of gdp, on an emergency handout of 600 reais a month to Brazilians who earn the minimum wage of 1,045 reais a month. That benefits 67m people, a third of the population. The payout lifted out of extreme poverty 72% of families in that condition. Among the beneficiaries are recipients of Bolsa Família, who get a much larger sum than the pro- gramme's minimum payment of 89 rears. In the poor north-east, the pt's heartland, the share of people who call the government's performance ""bad"" or ""terrible"" fell from 52% in June to 35% in August.
The government has extended to December the emergency benefit initially meant to last three months (but will reduce it by half). Mr Bolsonaro wants to replace Bolsa Família with his own Renda Brasil (Brazil Income), a benefit that will unify all social programmes. Its details are still vague. To give the economy an extra boost Mr Bolsonaro wants to borrow 5bn reais more this year to build infrastructure.
Pro-poor spending makes sense. The economy shrank by 9.7% in the second quarter. It is the same size as it was 11 years ago. Without the relief programme it would have shrunk more. The jobless rate climbed to 13.3% in the second quarter from 12% in the same period last year.
But the prospect of big deficits worries Mr Guedes. The government is set to smash through a ceiling on spending, which is inscribed in the constitution. (A workaround can probably be found.) The primary deficit, ie, before interest payments, jumped to $94bn in July from $6.5bn the year before. It is expected to reach $i47bn for the full year, 11% of gdp.
Disagreement between president and minister flared in late August, when Mr Guedes said the government should pay for Renda Brasil by cutting back other welfare programmes. Mr Bolsonaro rebuffed him. He would ""not take away from the poor to give to the poorest"", he said.
The two men seem to have reached a truce. Mr Guedes may accept a breach of the spending cap if Congress acts to control future spending, says Chris Garman of Eurasia Group, a political-risk consultancy. His other demand is reform of the tax system, which is among the most complex in the world. A mid-sized Brazilian firm typically spends 1,500 hours a year dealing with tax, compared with 175 for an American firm, according to the World Bank.
But reforming tax is as complex as taxation itself. One of Mr Guedes's ideas-replacing two taxes on company turnover with a 12% VAT-would anger farmers, who have a powerful lobby, notes Marcos Cintra, the chief of the federal revenue service until September. Consumers would also object. Reform, if it happens, will be ""a very noisy process"", says Mr Garman.
Mr Guedes has apparently decided he can still do some good. After tax reform could come measures to reduce public-sector employment and benefits. Perhaps. But Mr Bolsonaro has now seen that enlarging the state is more popular than shrinking it. As the presidential election approaches in 2022, the salience of that lesson will grow. Brazil's experiment with economic liberalism may prove short-lived.","Brazil

ONLY A DECADE ago Latin America seemed to be making a mark in the world. Enriched by a commodity boom and with democracy contributing to social progress, many of the region's governments felt part of ""the rise of the south in a multipolar world. John Kerry, Barack Obama's secretary of state, said in 2013 that the United States saw its newly self-confident neighbours as equals. ""The era of the Monroe doctrine is over, he declared, referring to an early American president's warning to European monarchies to keep out of the western hemisphere, which gradually evolved into the belief that the United States was the hegemon of the Americas.
Under President Donald Trump, the Monroe doctrine seems to be back. In 2019 John Bolton, then Mr Trump's national security adviser, proclaimed it to be ""alive and well in a speech in which he pledged to topple the dictatorships of Venezuela and Cuba. The United States has so far failed in that, but its neoMonrovianism has now produced a victory. It will take over the presidency of the Inter-American Development Bank (idb), a big regional lender which, though based in Washington, DC, has been in Latin American hands since its founding in 1959. On September 12th a virtual meeting of the board of governors chose Mauricio Claver-Carone, the Trump administration's top official for Latin America, as the bank's president.
He is a controversial choice, and not just because his election breaks with precedent. Until 2017 he was a lobbyist against Cuba's communist regime. A conservative Republican with limited experience of economic development, he is the chief architect of the sanctions the administration has imposed on Venezuela. He insists that he will be both a reforming president, and one who respects the views of the board of governors. Ojalá (if only), as Latin Americans say.
It is reasonable to assume that if Mr Trump wins a second term in November the idb will become a tool of United States foreign policy. Mr Claver-Carone shares the obsessions of his political sponsor, Senator Marco Rubio of Florida. One is to overthrow Cuban communism as well as the Venezuelan regime. The other is to drive China out of Latin America. Mr Claver-Carone talks of hiring more staff from small countries in Central America and the Caribbean, where China and Venezuela are influential. More lending to those countries may follow.
Many Latin Americans would like to see democracy come to Cuba and Venezuela, and worry about Chinese influence. But it is hardly in the region's interest to let these concerns overwhelm others or to divert development money away from needs made even more pressing by the pandemic, such as strengthening health care and education in the countries where most Latin Americans live. For these reasons a few governments-and many of the region's most distinguished former leaders-opposed Mr Claver-Carone. Yet they failed to unite behind a better qualified candidate; 23 of the region's 28 governments, including Brazil and Colombia, bowed to Mr Trump's will.
That it can no longer lead one of its flagship international institutions marks a nadir for Latin America. The region is dis-integrating. For that, the hubris of the Latin American left when in power a decade ago is partly to blame. Hugo Chávez in Venezuela and Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva in Brazil forged integration schemes based on political alignment (and more or less explicit anti-Americanism) rather than abiding national interest. Leftist excess contributed to polarisation and the advent of its opposite. Jair Bolsonaro, Brazil's hardright president, used Mr Trump's victory as a template for his own in 2018. His government has slavishly aligned with his idol's, out of ideological conviction. That seems to be the case, too, with Iván Duque, Colombia's president, who describes himself as a moderate but on foreign policy is not.
Another factor is weakness. The pandemic has struck the region hard after years of economic stagnation. Many presidents are in no mood to take risks. Mexico's Andrés Manuel López Obrador, a bully at home but a coward abroad, first backed and then scotched an Argentine plan to prevent a quorum at the governors' meeting to stop Mr ClaverCarone. Mr López Obrador mistrusts international financial institutions. Other governments reckoned Mr ClaverCarone was best placed to increase the iDB's capital and thus its loans. Few want a fight with Mr Trump. They prefer to hide in the wings of the world stage.","A defeat for a weak and divided Latin America

Rising regulation will force more firms to decarbonise
SUPPORT FOR solar panels in Georgia came from a surprising point on the American political spectrum. In 2013 Georgia Power, the local electricity monopoly, was reluctant to increase the use of solar panels. That irked Debbie Dooley, a preacher's daughter and co-founder of Atlanta's Tea Party, a hard-right Republican faction. She wanted more energy independence, and rooftop solar was one answer. Forming an alliance with the Sierra Club, a green lobby group, she established the Green Tea Party coalition. It helped defeat a bid by Georgia Power to hit rooftop-solar customers with high fees. Since 2013 Georgia's solar capacity has jumped more than 13-fold.
Politicians of all stripes are introducing green regulations. The Grantham Research Institute at the London School of Economics counts over 1,900 pieces of climate legislation around the world. Almost two-thirds were enacted in the past ten years. That may be good news for the planet, if perhaps not for many firms. By one estimate transition-related regulation, particularly carbon pricing, and technological disruption could reduce the market capitalisation of 1,400 of the world's biggest companies by 3%, or $1.6trn. And the costs are not evenly spread. For some the figure will be as big as 60%. In anticipation of carbon pricing, a small minority of companies are decarbonising-but too few to save the planet.
More rules are likely. Urged on by voters, policymakers are setting ever tougher green targets. Over 70 countries have committed to reaching net-zero by at least 2050. The eu proposed a net-zero target in law in March. All but one of the G7 countries have made similar commitments. America is the odd one out. Donald Trump, its president, has dubbed climate change a ""hoax"". His administration has rolled-back 68 environmental regulations, according to the New York Times. His scepticism has emboldened other world leaders such as Brazil's Jair Bolsonaro to pursue environmentally destructive policies. And Mr Trump has begun the process of withdrawing from the Paris agreement.
Yet many American states and cities have pushed back. Some have sought to challenge Mr Trump's rollbacks in court. Others have introduced their own green rules. Thirty of the 50 states have renewable-power portfolios; more than ten have low-carbon fuel standards for cars. Moreover, the polls suggest that Mr Trump's days in office are numbered. His Democratic opponent, Joe Biden, is promising to make fighting climate change a centrepiece of his presidency. He plans to spend $2trn in four years on low-carbon infrastructure and energy. He wants to join others by going for net-zero by 2050 and emissions-free electric power by 2035. Mr Biden was part of the team that helped negotiate the Paris agreement, which he plans to rejoin.
If he is elected, an early test of Mr Biden's ambitions may be America's ""nationally determined contribution"" (ndc). These are decarbonisation plans that countries promised to devise under the Paris agreement. Their cumulative impact is not currently sufficient to meet the Paris goals. But the signatories also agreed to ""ratchet up"" their ndc ambitions every five years. The first round of updates were due this year. If Mr Biden wins, he could announce a new ndc in early 2021. Climate warriors will hope for national carbon pricing, which Mr Biden supported as vice-president.
Such a move would be a huge boost for carbon pricing everywhere. About half of current ndcs mention the idea. In 2010 about 5% of the world's emissions were covered by a carbon price. Today, that figure is over 15%. Next year China is expected to roll out the world's biggest scheme. The eu currently has the next-largest, and plans an expansion. Yet the price of carbon varies enormously. In most cases, it is far below $75 a tonne of CO2, the level the imf says would be needed to meet the 2°C target. In some places, the price has started to climb. It hit record highs in California and Oregon in late 2019 due to tougher fuel-emissions standards. Having corrected an oversupply problem, the eu price also rose to €24 a tonne in January, up from €8 in 2018.
How might an upsurge in climate regulation affect business? An analysis by Vivid Economics, a consultancy, and the Principles for Responsible Investment, a UN-backed group of investors, offers some answers. The researchers looked at the exposure of 1,400-odd publicly listed companies to ""transition risks""-technological and regulatory threats from decarbonisation. Some $1.6trn, or 3.1%, of market capitalisation, would be wiped off the value of the msci All Country World Index, a gauge of global stockmarkets. This assumes regulations are enacted from 2020. If policymakers delay five years, even faster decarbonisation will be needed, meaning stricter rules and a sharper revaluation of assets. In such a case, values may fall by 4.5%. The longer policymakers delay, the greater the shock, warns Jason Eis of Vivid Economics.
Whenever it occurs, the shock will be concentrated. In the least-damaging scenario, four-fifths of companies would see their value move up or down by less than 10%. But the impact on the remaining fifth is bigger. The worst-performing 100 firms would lose 43% of their value; the best performers would gain 33%. Energy is the hardest-hit sector, followed by other high-emitting industries such as utilities and mining. Within sectors there are winners and losers too. Companies that embrace low-carbon strategies will do best; heavy polluters will suffer most.
Pressure to cut CO2 emissions comes also from the bottom up. Climate-conscious bosses say consumers are demanding greener products, especially in Europe. A survey by Yale University found that almost a third of Americans claim to have bought products because a company is taking steps to reduce global warming. Over a quarter say they have avoided products sold by firms opposed to such steps. Company boycotts, supercharged by social media, pose rising reputational risk. Some big firms, including Amazon and Nestlé, have changed environmental policies following the threat of mass consumer action.
Sweden may offer a glimpse of the future. Shoppers seem to be turning away from polluting products. Even before covid-19, flygskam (flightshaming) appears to have cut demand in 2019 for European flights from Sweden on sas and Braathens, two Scandinavian airlines, by 4% and 12%, respectively.
Shrewd firms are preparing for the transition by decarbonising now. Broadly speaking, four approaches have been followed. The first is to sell dirty assets or buy clean ones. Royal dsm, a Dutch chemicals company, cut its carbon emissions by 90% from 2006 to 2019. About half came from selling carbon-intensive business units such as petrochemicals, says Feike Sijbesma, its former boss. Earlier this month the oil major bp bought stakes in two offshore wind projects in America from Equinor, Norway's state-owned oil giant.
Or just buy cleaner
A second tactic, used especially by firms with high vehicle or power emissions, is to buy cleaner energy, thus not having to alter business models. The more clean power that firms buy the further costs fall, notes Nigel Topping, an adviser to the British government. Around 260 companies have pledged to use only renewable energy from 2050 or earlier. Since 2008 companies have bought more renewable power than the annual electricity capacity of Vietnam. Green cars are in vogue too. Over 80 firms, including Amazon, have vowed to add many more electric vehicles to their fleets.
A third method is to invest in new low-carbon products. Corporate spending on climate-related investments crept up from $135bn in 2013 to $172bn in 2018, according to the Climate Policy Initiative, an advisory group. Some of this is in-house. Take Maersk, a giant in shipping, an industry that accounts for about 2-3% of global emissions. If Maersk wants its ships to stop all emissions by 2050, it needs the new technology by 2030. It is examining new fuels, from ammonia-based ones to alcohol. ""This is a completely new game for us,"" says Simon Christopher Bergulf, the firm's head of regulatory affairs.
Other firms are investing in startups. jbs and Tyson, two meat-sellers, have invested in plant-based protein. Zunum Aero, a Seattle-based outfit, plans to bring a small hybrid-electric aircraft to market. Its backers include Boeing and JetBlue, an airline. Oil majors' venture-capital arms routinely invest in clean-energy firms. Chevron, Occidental Petroleum and ExxonMobil have all bought into startups trying to suck CO2 from the air.
The final idea is to decarbonise supply chains. Andrew Howard, of Schroders, says that on average 60% of a company's carbon risk lies in its supply chain, not least because tax-hit suppliers may pass costs back up the chain. But cutting carbon out of supply chains is fiendishly tricky. The first problem is data. Most companies have armies of suppliers, few of which monitor environmental metrics. Next is the difficulty of persuading suppliers to take action. Ikea has a €100m fund to help suppliers buy renewable energy. Scania, a Swedish lorry-maker, trains suppliers on decarbonisation and conducts sustainability audits. Those who continue to fail will lose Scania's business, says Henrik Henriksson, its boss.
Badgering suppliers is important for two reasons. First, some emissions are outside companies' control. The Economist estimates that emissions from publicly listed, investor-owned companies account for some ten gigatonnes of greenhouse gases, a fifth of the world's total. Much of the rest comes from farming, households, governments and state-owned firms. Second, the share of firms shrinking their carbon footprint is small. A report by Boston Consulting Group, a consultancy, and the World Economic Forum says that fewer than 3,000 of the millions of companies around the world reveal their full carbon footprints to the cdp's emissions-disclosure programme. Around 1,600 of these have set emissions-reduction targets but fewer than 1,000 have actually cut emissions in the past year. The firms that abate are typically those for which it is easiest. Financial firms lowered emissions by 34% in the past year, compared with just 9% in the transport sector.
Among the biggest polluters, decarbonisation efforts are dismal. A report by the Transition Pathway Initiative, a research project set up by asset owners, looked at 238 energy, industrial and transport firms with big carbon footprints. Just 18% are on course to cut their emissions enough to help meet the 2°C target. A study by the Climate Action 100+ found a similar result.
Carbon taxes are not bad news for all firms. Carbon-efficient ones in high-emitting industries will gain an edge. They would pay a small levy under carbon taxes, while large costs would hinder competitors. Take the aluminium industry. Producing one tonne of the metal typically generates about 13 tonnes of CO2. But that figure varies greatly depending on the power source. It can be cut to four tonnes using low-carbon energy to power smelters. All the largest non-Chinese producers now offer low-carbon products.
For firms where change is the hardest, lobbying against climate regulations is quietly taking place. InfluenceMap, a research firm, says that since 2015 lobbying efforts among oil companies have slowed. But the American Petroleum Institute (api), a powerful trade group, increased its lobbying after Mr Trump's election to encourage regulatory rollbacks. Some oil firms, such as bp and Equinor, have publicly distanced themselves from the api even while retaining membership.
A further explanation may lie in another rising fear: the threat of litigation. Lawsuits have long battered the tobacco industry. Could climate-change prosecutions be next?

Almost two-thirds were enacted in the past ten years. That may be good news for the planet, if perhaps not for many firms. By one estimate transition-related regulation, particularly carbon pricing, and technological disruption could reduce the market capitalisation of 1,400 of the world's biggest companies by 3%, or $1.6trn. And the costs are not evenly spread. For some the figure will be as big as 60%. In anticipation of carbon pricing, a small minority of companies are decarbonising-but too few to save the planet.
More rules are likely. Urged on by voters, policymakers are setting ever tougher green targets. Over 70 countries have committed to reaching net-zero by at least 2050. The eu proposed a net-zero target in law in March. All but one of the G7 countries have made similar commitments. America is the odd one out. Donald Trump, its president, has dubbed climate change a ""hoax"". His administration has rolled-back 68 environmental regulations, according to the New York Times. His scepticism has emboldened other world leaders such as Brazil's Jair Bolsonaro to pursue environmentally destructive policies. And Mr Trump has begun the process of withdrawing from the Paris agreement.
Yet many American states and cities have pushed back. Some have sought to challenge Mr Trump's rollbacks in court. Others have introduced their own green rules. Thirty of the 50 states have renewable-power portfolios; more than ten have low-carbon fuel standards for cars. Moreover, the polls suggest that Mr Trump's days in office are numbered. His Democratic opponent, Joe Biden, is promising to make fighting climate change a centrepiece of his presidency. He plans to spend $2trn in four years on low-carbon infrastructure and energy. He wants to join others by going for net-zero by 2050 and emissions-free electric power by 2035. Mr Biden was part of the team that helped negotiate the Paris agreement, which he plans to rejoin.
If he is elected, an early test of Mr Biden's ambitions may be America's ""nationally determined contribution"" (ndc). These are decarbonisation plans that countries promised to devise under the Paris agreement. Their cumulative impact is not currently sufficient to meet the Paris goals. But the signatories also agreed to ""ratchet up"" their ndc ambitions every five years. The first round of updates were due this year. If Mr Biden wins, he could announce a new ndc in early 2021. Climate warriors will hope for national carbon pricing, which Mr Biden supported as vice-president.
Such a move would be a huge boost for carbon pricing everywhere. About half of current ndcs mention the idea. In 2010 about 5% of the world's emissions were covered by a carbon price. Today, that figure is over 15%. Next year China is expected to roll out the world's biggest scheme. The eu currently has the next-largest, and plans an expansion. Yet the price of carbon varies enormously. In most cases, it is far below $75 a tonne of CO2, the level the imf says would be needed to meet the 2°C target. In some places, the price has started to climb. It hit record highs in California and Oregon in late 2019 due to tougher fuel-emissions standards. Having corrected an oversupply problem, the eu price also rose to €24 a tonne in January, up from €8 in 2018.
How might an upsurge in climate regulation affect business? An analysis by Vivid Economics, a consultancy, and the Principles for Responsible Investment, a UN-backed group of investors, offers some answers. The researchers looked at the exposure of 1,400-odd publicly listed companies to ""transition risks""-technological and regulatory threats from decarbonisation. Some $1.6trn, or 3.1%, of market capitalisation, would be wiped off the value of the msci All Country World Index, a gauge of global stockmarkets. This assumes regulations are enacted from 2020. If policymakers delay five years, even faster decarbonisation will be needed, meaning stricter rules and a sharper revaluation of assets. In such a case, values may fall by 4.5%. The longer policymakers delay, the greater the shock, warns Jason Eis of Vivid Economics.
Whenever it occurs, the shock will be concentrated. In the least-damaging scenario, four-fifths of companies would see their value move up or down by less than 10%. But the impact on the remaining fifth is bigger. The worst-performing 100 firms would lose 43% of their value; the best performers would gain 33%. Energy is the hardest-hit sector, followed by other high-emitting industries such as utilities and mining. Within sectors there are winners and losers too. Companies that embrace low-carbon strategies will do best; heavy polluters will suffer most.
Pressure to cut CO2 emissions comes also from the bottom up. Climate-conscious bosses say consumers are demanding greener products, especially in Europe. A survey by Yale University found that almost a third of Americans claim to have bought products because a company is taking steps to reduce global warming. Over a quarter say they have avoided products sold by firms opposed to such steps. Company boycotts, supercharged by social media, pose rising reputational risk. Some big firms, including Amazon and Nestlé, have changed environmental policies following the threat of mass consumer action.
Sweden may offer a glimpse of the future. Shoppers seem to be turning away from polluting products. Even before covid-19, flygskam (flightshaming) appears to have cut demand in 2019 for European flights from Sweden on sas and Braathens, two Scandinavian airlines, by 4% and 12%, respectively.
Shrewd firms are preparing for the transition by decarbonising now. Broadly speaking, four approaches have been followed. The first is to sell dirty assets or buy clean ones. Royal dsm, a Dutch chemicals company, cut its carbon emissions by 90% from 2006 to 2019. About half came from selling carbon-intensive business units such as petrochemicals, says Feike Sijbesma, its former boss. Earlier this month the oil major bp bought stakes in two offshore wind projects in America from Equinor, Norway's state-owned oil giant.
Or just buy cleaner
A second tactic, used especially by firms with high vehicle or power emissions, is to buy cleaner energy, thus not having to alter business models. The more clean power that firms buy the further costs fall, notes Nigel Topping, an adviser to the British government. Around 260 companies have pledged to use only renewable energy from 2050 or earlier. Since 2008 companies have bought more renewable power than the annual electricity capacity of Vietnam. Green cars are in vogue too. Over 80 firms, including Amazon, have vowed to add many more electric vehicles to their fleets.
A third method is to invest in new low-carbon products. Corporate spending on climate-related investments crept up from $135bn in 2013 to $172bn in 2018, according to the Climate Policy Initiative, an advisory group. Some of this is in-house. Take Maersk, a giant in shipping, an industry that accounts for about 2-3% of global emissions. If Maersk wants its ships to stop all emissions by 2050, it needs the new technology by 2030. It is examining new fuels, from ammonia-based ones to alcohol. ""This is a completely new game for us,"" says Simon Christopher Bergulf, the firm's head of regulatory affairs.
Other firms are investing in startups. jbs and Tyson, two meat-sellers, have invested in plant-based protein. Zunum Aero, a Seattle-based outfit, plans to bring a small hybrid-electric aircraft to market. Its backers include Boeing and JetBlue, an airline. Oil majors' venture-capital arms routinely invest in clean-energy firms. Chevron, Occidental Petroleum and ExxonMobil have all bought into startups trying to suck CO2 from the air.
The final idea is to decarbonise supply chains. Andrew Howard, of Schroders, says that on average 60% of a company's carbon risk lies in its supply chain, not least because tax-hit suppliers may pass costs back up the chain. But cutting carbon out of supply chains is fiendishly tricky. The first problem is data. Most companies have armies of suppliers, few of which monitor environmental metrics. Next is the difficulty of persuading suppliers to take action. Ikea has a €100m fund to help suppliers buy renewable energy. Scania, a Swedish lorry-maker, trains suppliers on decarbonisation and conducts sustainability audits. Those who continue to fail will lose Scania's business, says Henrik Henriksson, its boss.
Badgering suppliers is important for two reasons. First, some emissions are outside companies' control. The Economist estimates that emissions from publicly listed, investor-owned companies account for some ten gigatonnes of greenhouse gases, a fifth of the world's total. Much of the rest comes from farming, households, governments and state-owned firms. Second, the share of firms shrinking their carbon footprint is small. A report by Boston Consulting Group, a consultancy, and the World Economic Forum says that fewer than 3,000 of the millions of companies around the world reveal their full carbon footprints to the cdp's emissions-disclosure programme. Around 1,600 of these have set emissions-reduction targets but fewer than 1,000 have actually cut emissions in the past year. The firms that abate are typically those for which it is easiest. Financial firms lowered emissions by 34% in the past year, compared with just 9% in the transport sector.
Among the biggest polluters, decarbonisation efforts are dismal. A report by the Transition Pathway Initiative, a research project set up by asset owners, looked at 238 energy, industrial and transport firms with big carbon footprints. Just 18% are on course to cut their emissions enough to help meet the 2°C target. A study by the Climate Action 100+ found a similar result.
Carbon taxes are not bad news for all firms. Carbon-efficient ones in high-emitting industries will gain an edge. They would pay a small levy under carbon taxes, while large costs would hinder competitors. Take the aluminium industry. Producing one tonne of the metal typically generates about 13 tonnes of CO2. But that figure varies greatly depending on the power source. It can be cut to four tonnes using low-carbon energy to power smelters. All the largest non-Chinese producers now offer low-carbon products.
For firms where change is the hardest, lobbying against climate regulations is quietly taking place. InfluenceMap, a research firm, says that since 2015 lobbying efforts among oil companies have slowed. But the American Petroleum Institute (api), a powerful trade group, increased its lobbying after Mr Trump's election to encourage regulatory rollbacks. Some oil firms, such as bp and Equinor, have publicly distanced themselves from the api even while retaining membership.
A further explanation may lie in another rising fear: the threat of litigation. Lawsuits have long battered the tobacco industry. Could climate-change prosecutions be next?

The pandemic has reversed years of progress in reducing extreme poverty. Once again, politicians bear much blame
This coronavirus affects everyone, but not equally. The young often shrug off the virus; the old often die of it. The rich shrug off the economic shock; the poor cannot. Because of covid-19, the number of extremely poor people (ie, those making less than $1.90 a day) will rise by 70m-100m this year, the World Bank predicts. Using a broader measure, including those who lack basic shelter or clean water and children who go hungry, the ranks of the poor will swell by240m-490m this year, says the un. That could reverse almost a decade of progress (see International section). If a vaccine is found, economies will no doubt bounce back. But widespread vaccination will take years and the very poor cannot wait that long. By then, malnutrition will have stunted a tragic number of children's bodies and minds.
Governments in rich countries have spent over 10% of gdp to ease the economic pain. Others cannot be so ambitious. Emerging economies have spent just 3%, and the poorest nations less than 1%. Safety-nets in low-income countries are cobweb-thin. Governments there have handed out only $4 extra per person on social programmes-in total, not per day.
Donors should help. Rich countries are on course to cut direct aid by a third compared with last year. The imf and World Bank have raised lending, but only 31% more of the bank's money has reached poor countries, says the Centre for Global Development, a think-tank, about half the increase in the global financial crisis, a much smaller shock.
Governments in poor countries, meanwhile, need to spend their money wisely. Too many offer pork for chums and crumbs for the poor. Since the crisis began, Mexico has provided no new programmes for the hard-up but has given Pemex, the state oil giant, tax breaks worth $2.7bn, or $21 per Mexican. India has poured $7bn down coal mines. South Africa is expected soon to confirm another wasteful effort to keep its money-losing airline aloft. Even when money is earmarked for good ends, it is too often wasted or stolen. South African investigators are probing possible fraud in 658 contracts worth $300m for covid-fighting kit. Nigeria's health ministry bought some masks for $53 each. In a leaked recording, a voice allegedly belonging to a Ugandan official guffaws as she and her colleagues appear to plot to pocket money meant for alleviating suffering in the pandemic.
The best way to help the poor is to give them money directly. The simplicity of this policy makes it less vulnerable to corruption. With a little extra cash in their pockets, recipients can feed their children and send them back to school. They can avoid a fire-sale of assets, such as a motorbike-taxi or a cow, that will help them make a living in the future. One country that has done well getting cash into poor pockets is Brazil, despite President Jair Bolsonaro's habit of downplaying the effects of covid-19. Various measures of poverty there have actually fallen, largely because the government has sent $110 per month for three months to the impecunious, helping 66m people. A priority for governments should be basic health care, which the pandemic has disrupted so badly that vaccination rates for children have been set back about 20 years.
The crisis requires politicians to make hard choices quickly. Mistakes are inevitable, given how much remains unknown about the disease. But some are inexcusable. India's sudden lockdown threw millions of migrant workers out of their urban jobs and lodgings, forcing them to head back to their villages on foot or crowded trains, spreading the virus far and wide. South Africa barred people from leaving home at night but then evicted tens of thousands of squatters from shacks on public land, with no place to go. Politicians governing remotely from their comfortable home offices should think harder about how their decisions might affect those whom covid-19 is plunging back into dire poverty. It is shameful when their responses to the pandemic add to the suffering of the least fortunate.","Covid-19 and poverty

On september 21st President Andrés Manuel López Obrador (known as amlo) began his televised early-morning press conference by asking a functionary to read out an interminable list of petrol prices at service stations around the country. Then there were video updates on amlo's pet infrastructure projects: an $8bn oil refinery, a new airport in Mexico City and three new railway lines. After an hour or so, he got to the meat of his agenda: attacking two small monthly magazines, Nexos and Letras Libres, and singling out by name their editors, Héctor Aguilar Camín and Enrique Krauze.
They ""were the chiefs of the intelligentsia throughout the neoliberal period"", amlo complained. He insinuated that they acted as hired propagandists for the governments of his predecessors. ""They belong to the conservative grouping which would like to maintain the same regime of corruption, injustices and privilege,"" he said earlier this month. These attacks, which apply, too, to Reforma, an independent newspaper, have intensified in the past few weeks. They look like an attempt to silence critical voices in the Mexican media by a populist president who has already hobbled previously independent institutions such as the Supreme Court and regulatory agencies. Many media businesses practise self-censorship.
Last month the government fined Nexos 1m pesos ($45,000) and banned all state bodies from dealings with it or its small book publisher. An official claimed that in 2018, when the magazine won an advertising contract from the Social Security Institute, it had failed to pay full labour taxes for its staff. This is false, says Mr Aguilar, who has appealed to a court. This month Paco Ignacio Taibo, a leftist historian appointed by amlo to be the director of a big state-owned publisher and bookseller, warned Messrs Aguilar and Krauze: ""stay in your little corner or change countries. It's not a threat."" It obviously was, and amlo has not required Mr Taibo to withdraw it.
This ""public lynching"" is dangerous, says Mr Krauze, a historian. ""The presidential word is very powerful in Mexico. You don't know how people will interpret it if he is continually pointing to someone as an enemy."" Some critics of past presidents have been murdered (as have journalists who fell foul of crime gangs).
Government support for the media through advertising is an unhealthy Mexican tradition, going back to the 1920s. amlo is continuing it with partisan gusto. During his first year in office, the two main television companies, which provide adulatory coverage, received a total of 700m pesos in advertising. La Jornada, a small leftist daily, got 252m pesos.
The president's insinuations that Nexos and Letras Libres lived purely from state largesse during earlier administrations are false. Mr Krauze says that income from the state, which included advertising, subscriptions by public libraries and contracts for historical documentaries, amounted to only 15% of the total revenues of his cultural businesses, Letras Libres and Clío, a film company. In Nexos's case government advertising was around 25% of the total.
Both Nexos and Letras Libres are niche publications whose combined circulation is fewer than 30,000 copies (though both have popular websites). So why is amlo scared of them? There are two apparent reasons. One is that he is temperamentally allergic to criticism. The other is that he is pursuing a populist strategy of dividing his country into ""the people"" and ""the reactionaries"". No matter that both Mr Krauze and Mr Aguilar have been champions of democracy for decades, and were fiercely critical of previous governments.
Although opinion polls give amlo an approval rating of around 55%, the going is getting tougher for him ahead of a vital mid-term election next July. His government has mismanaged the pandemic. Mexico's economy is set to contract by 10% this year, more than the regional average. A president who claims to champion the poor has done little to prevent their numbers multiplying.
This month 650 of Mexico's most prominent academics and intellectuals published an open letter stating that ""freedom of expression is under siege in Mexico, and with that democracy is threatened."" That mirrors the fears of intellectuals in Brazil regarding their populist president, Jair Bolsonaro. Mr Bolsonaro is of the right, and amlo claims to be of the left. But it increasingly looks as if the main difference between them is merely that the Mexican speaks more softly and has nicer manners.","The president 's war on the intelligentsia

When the pandemic struck Piura, a city in northern Peru, Daniel Zapata had a part-time job with a market-research firm. The 250 soles ($70) he earned each month paid his fees for a three-year course in business administration. The covid-19 recession put paid to all that. The firm closed, and Mr Zapata, who is 20 and lives with his parents and a sister, has dropped out of his course. The family received 760 soles in emergency aid from Peru's government. With the lockdown over, they must now rely on his sister's income as a teacher and his father's pension from his years working in a textile factory. Having lived in the lower tier of the middle class, Mr Zapata is staring into the abyss of poverty. He expects little from a general election next April. The politicians ""just squabble instead of working"", he says.
The covid-19 recession is wiping out years of progress in Latin America in reducing poverty and inequality. Economists are starting to map just how big the social impact of the pandemic is. Many governments imposed long lockdowns. These hit the half of Latin Americans who work in the informal economy especially hard. Many countries, like Peru, offset part of the lost income by expanding aid programmes for the poor. That has helped, but not enough, and the effort may not be sustainable.
The region's economy is set to contract by 9.1% this year, according to the un Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean. It says this means that 45m people will fall back into poverty (taking the total to 37% of the population). The unemployment rate has risen by 2.2 percentage points to 11% in nine countries for which data are available, reports the International Labour Organisation. Income from wages in Latin America has fallen by 19.3%, compared with a global average of 10.7%.
These estimates assume that everyone loses a similar percentage of their income. Nora Lustig, an Argentine economist, and her team at Tulane University in New Orleans have used household surveys to figure out which groups lost most income and received most from the government in Brazil, Mexico, Colombia and urban areas of Argentina, which together account for two-thirds of Latin America's total population. They think that the biggest losers will be among the region's lower-middle classes, because social-assistance programmes provide an income floor for many of the poor. Although women, people of African descent and indigenous people are more likely to lose income, they get more help from the government.
Ms Lustig thinks the year may end with up to 21m new poor in those four countries. The impact is much bigger in Mexico than in Brazil, because of contrasting government policies. Mexico's president, Andrés Manuel López Obrador, claims to be of the left and his campaign slogan was ""First, the poor"". Yet he has done little to help the poorest. Brazil's president, Jair Bolsonaro, is of the hard right. But his government has made an emergency payment of $107 per month for five months, from which 53m people have benefited. The payment has been extended, though at a lower amount. Poverty could even decline slightly in Brazil, while in Mexico there will be at least 10m new poor.
The damage will last. Even though the pandemic is at last starting to wane in the region, at least for now, and many economies have opened up again, demand will remain depressed because firms and workers are poorer. Researchers at the Inter-American Development Bank have found that in past recessions when gdp contracted by 5% or more unemployment took an average of nine years to return to its previous level.
If the pandemic-induced recession is like previous ones it will reverse much of Latin America's recent progress in reducing inequality. The causes of that progress included the spread of education and more demand for unskilled workers in service businesses. The hard-up are much less likely to be able to work remotely. The many low-skilled workers whose jobs require personal contactwaiters, hairdressers, etc-may see their wages fall.
Even before the pandemic Latin America was highly unequal. Frustration at slow economic growth, lack of opportunity and a discredited political class showed in the election of populist presidents and in street protests in several countries. The tens of millions of new poor have reasons for resentment. They may not accept their fate quietly. That is likely to shape the region's politics for years to come.","Millions of Latin Americans who thought they were middle - class are suddenly not

Many countries , like Peru , offset part of the lost income by expanding aid programmes for the poor . That has helped , but not enough , and the effort may not be sustainable . 
 The region 's economy is set to contract by 9.1 % this year , according to the un Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean . It says this means that 45 m people will fall back into poverty ( taking the total to 37 % of the population ) . The unemployment rate has risen by 2.2 percentage points to 11 % in nine countries for which data are available , reports the International Labour Organisation . Income from wages in Latin America has fallen by 19.3 % , compared with a global average of 10.7 % . 
 These estimates assume that everyone loses a similar percentage of their income . Nora Lustig , an Argentine economist , and her team at Tulane University in New Orleans have used household surveys to figure out which groups lost most income and received most from the government in Brazil , Mexico , Colombia and urban areas of Argentina , which together account for two - thirds of Latin America 's total population . They think that the biggest losers will be among the region 's lower - middle classes , because social - assistance programmes provide an income floor for many of the poor . Although women , people of African descent and indigenous people are more likely to lose income , they get more help from the government . 
 Ms Lustig thinks the year may end with up to 21 m new poor in those four countries . The impact is much bigger in Mexico than in Brazil , because of contrasting government policies . Mexico 's president , Andrés Manuel López Obrador , claims to be of the left and his campaign slogan was "" First , the poor "" . Yet he has done little to help the poorest . Jair Bolsonaro's , is of the hard right . But Jair Bolsonaro's government has made an emergency payment of $ 107 per month for five months , from which 53 m people have benefited . The payment has been extended , though at a lower amount . Poverty could even decline slightly in Brazil , while in Mexico there will be at least 10 m new poor . 
 The damage will last . Even though the pandemic is at last starting to wane in the region , at least for now , and many economies have opened up again , demand will remain depressed because firms and workers are poorer . Researchers at the Inter - American Development Bank have found that in past recessions when gdp contracted by 5 % or more unemployment took an average of nine years to return to its previous level . 
 If the pandemic - induced recession is like previous ones it will reverse much of Latin America 's recent progress in reducing inequality . The causes of that progress included the spread of education and more demand for unskilled workers in service businesses . The hard - up are much less likely to be able to work remotely . The many low - skilled workers whose jobs require personal contactwaiters , hairdressers , etc - may see their wages fall . 
 Even before the pandemic Latin America was highly unequal . Frustration at slow economic growth , lack of opportunity and a discredited political class showed in the election of populist presidents and in street protests in several countries . The tens of millions of new poor have reasons for resentment . They may not accept their fate quietly . That is likely to shape the region 's politics for years to come .",140,Brazil,ctb-140-2,IN TERM,True,"Brazil 's president , Jair Bolsonaro",2,True

Mixed martial arts is on the rise, and on the right
Mansfield, a former mining town in the Midlands, tends to be ahead of the curve. In 2017, after 94 years under Labour control, it fell to the Conservative Party, foreshadowing the collapse of the ""red wall"" of northern Labour seats in 2019. It is also in the forefront of a sporting revolution sweeping former industrial towns, particularly in the north and the Midlands: the rise of mixed martial arts.
mma fighters are locked in a cage and employ violent tactics to subdue their opponents. The sport has spread to Britain from America, home to the Ultimate Fighting Championship (ufc), the world's largest mma promotion company. In 2007 the British Medical Association advised that the sport be banned on the grounds that it was too violent, but it has continued to grow, and now boasts the same participation among 18-34-year-old men as cricket and rugby, according to Harris Interactive, a market researcher. In November 2019 the ufc opened a gym in Nottingham, the first of its kind in Europe, and earlier this month the bbc broadcast an mma fight for the first time.
A focus on discipline, often combined with teetotalism, has won the sport a reputation for keeping young men in deprived areas on the straight and narrow. ""It's discipline and respect, little things like that, that aren't much about nowadays,"" says Christian Smith, a former professional fighter who now runs Tap or Snap, one of Mansfield's 14 mma gyms. Jimmy Hey, an mma trainer who runs the Apex Gym in Great Harwood, Lancashire, says he would often drive around the area and spot his students acting up. ""I'd catch them with an eight-pack of beer, getting ready to go home at 12 o'clock in the afternoon and just sit there and get drunk... So I used to drag them off the street and that. But they responded really well.""
Brutality in the ring can turn cage fighters into celebrities with international reputations. Michael Bisping, from Clitheroe, Lancashire, worked in factories before moving to America where he became a world champion. ""A lot of lads see it as a way out,"" says Mr Hey. Fans reject the idea that fighters are mere thugs. ""It can look like mindless violence in a cage,"" admits one. ""But I've heard it compared to highspeed chess, which I agree with.""
On both sides of the Atlantic, the sport has political overtones. In America, Dana White, president of the ufc, and Colby Covington, a welterweight champion, are outspoken supporters of Donald Trump. Darren Till, a Liverpudlian fighter who has relocated to Brazil, is a cheer-leader for Jair Bolsonaro. In America and Germany, some mma gyms are associated with the far right. The sport is a natural fit for extremists who want to co-opt it, says Alex Channon, a senior lecturer of sport at the University of Brighton. ""The struggle for physical domination between men is pretty much central to fascist ideology.""
Britain First, a fascist group, had an mma instructor at a training camp in Erith, south-east London; that came to light- and to an end-when Paul Golding, the group's leader, was handed a suspended prison sentence in 2017 after headbutting the instructor in a nightclub. Mr Hey was questioned by anti-terror police after Hope Not Hate, an advocacy group, claimed he was training members of National Action, a banned group. He admits to having trained National Action members but says he did not realise they belonged to the group. A subgroup of mma embraces cultural nationalism, claiming that martial arts were invented not by East Asians, but by ancient Celts. The majority of mma enthusiasts regard them as eccentric.
The left is challenging right-wing domination of the sport, through so-called ""red gyms"". Some offer training to activists to fight fascists at protests; others, like Solstar in London, teach lefties about healthy living.

The pandemic has eroded democracy and respect for human rights
People were hungry during lockdown. So Francis Zaake, a Ugandan member of parliament, bought some rice and sugar and had it delivered to his neediest constituents. For this charitable act, he was arrested. Mr Zaake is a member of the opposition, and Uganda's President Yoweri Museveni has ordered that only the government may hand out food aid. Anyone else who does so can be charged with murder, Mr Museveni has threatened, since they might do it in a disorderly way, attract crowds and thereby spread the coronavirus.
Mr Zaake had been careful not to put his constituents at risk. Rather than having crowds converge on one place to pick up the food parcels, he had them delivered to people's doors by motorbike-taxi. Nonetheless, the next day police and soldiers jumped over his fence while he was showering and broke into his house. They dragged him into a van and threw him in a cell. He says they beat, kicked and cut him, crushed his testicles, sprayed a blinding chemical into his eyes, called him a dog and told him to quit politics. He claims that one sneered: ""We can do whatever we want to you or even kill you...No one will demonstrate for you because they are under lockdown."" The police say he inflicted the injuries on himself and is fishing for sympathy with foreign donors.
The charges against him were eventually dropped, but the message was clear. ""The president doesn't want the opposition to give out food,"" says Mr Zaake, who walks with crutches and wears sunglasses to protect his eyes. ""He knows that people will like us [if we do].""
The pandemic has been terrible not only for the human body but also for the body politic. Freedom House, a think-tank in Washington, counts 80 countries where the quality of democracy and respect for human rights have deteriorated since the pandemic began. The list includes both dictatorships that have grown nastier and democracies where standards have slipped. Only one country, Malawi, has improved (see map overleaf). Covid-19 ""has fuelled a crisis for democracy around the world,"" argue Sarah Repucci and Amy Slipowitz of Freedom House. Global freedom has been declining since just before the financial crisis of 2007-08, by their reckoning. Covid-19 has accelerated this pre-existing trend in several ways.
The disease poses a grave and fast-moving threat to every nation. Governments have, quite reasonably, assumed emergency powers to counter it. But such powers can be abused. Governments have selectively banned protests on the grounds that they might spread the virus, silenced critics and scapegoated minorities. They have used emergency measures to harass dissidents. And they have taken advantage of a general atmosphere of alarm. With everyone's attention on covid-19, autocrats and would-be autocrats in many countries can do all sorts of bad things, safe in the knowledge that the rest of the world will barely notice, let alone object.
Measuring the pandemic's effect on democracy and human rights is hard. Without covid-19, would China's rulers still have inflicted such horrors on Muslim Uyghurs this year? Would Thailand's king have grabbed nearly absolute powers? Would Egypt have executed 15 political prisoners in a single weekend this month? Perhaps. But these outrages would surely have faced stronger opposition, both at home and abroad. Granted, the current American administration makes less fuss about human rights than previous ones have and covid-19 has not changed that. But the voice from the White House is not the only one that counts.
Last year was a year of mass protests, which swept six continents, brought down five governments (Algeria, Bolivia, Iraq, Lebanon and Sudan) and forced others to rethink unpopular policies, as in Chile, France and Hong Kong. This year, by contrast, governments have banned mass gatherings to enforce social distancing. For many, this is wonderfully convenient.
For example, in India, the world's largest democracy, the biggest campaign of civil resistance for decades erupted shortly before the pandemic. For 100 days protesters raged against proposed changes to citizenship laws that would discriminate against Muslims and potentially render millions of them stateless. These protests petered out after a curfew was imposed in response to covid-19, since it was no longer possible to occupy the streets.
Later, when Prime Minister Narendra Modi's Hindu-nationalist government began imposing strict local lockdowns, it singled out neighbourhoods which had held protests, many of which were Muslim. Heavy police barricades locked in residents for weeks.
In early September the government declared that in the upcoming parliamentary session there would be no Question Hour for the opposition and no private members' bills-long-standing institutions that allow opposition mps to query the government directly. The excuse: the health risks of covid-19, along with assertions that in a crisis, legislative time was too precious to waste on noisy debate. The opposition walked out, allowing Mr Modi to ram through 25 bills in three days. He then suspended the session eight days early, having apparently forgotten the earlier excuse that time was short.
At the outset of the crisis Mr Modi, who has a knack for the theatrics of power, called on citizens to bang on pots, and later to light sacred lamps, in a show of solidarity to fight the pandemic. These displays, taken up by his supporters with glee, were not spontaneous expressions of support for doctors and nurses, like similar displays in Italy, Spain or Britain. Rather, they were a demonstration of Mr Modi's power.
H.L. Mencken, an American journalist, once wrote that ""the whole aim of practical politics is to keep the populace alarmed (and hence clamorous to be led to safety) by an endless series of hobgoblins, most of them imaginary."" He could have added that when people have real cause for alarm, they are even keener to be led to safety. Some put their trust in the sober calculations of evidence-driven experts. Others put their faith in strongmen.
Mr Modi has racked up colossal approval ratings this year, even as he presides over a double catastrophe of mass death and economic slump. So has Rodrigo Duterte in the Philippines, despite the largest reported caseload in South-East Asia. Mr Duterte's poll numbers may be coloured by fear; he has had thousands of people, supposedly criminal suspects, killed without trial, a campaign that appears to have intensified during the pandemic. But many Filipinos admire his grim style-extending a ""state of calamity"" for another year last month, temporarily banning many nurses from going to work overseas and vowing to try the first covid-19 vaccine himself to show it is safe.
Popular, you're gonna be popular
Admiration for Jair Bolsonaro, Brazil's militaristic president, is as high as ever, despite over 5m covid-19 cases and more than 150,000 deaths. This is partly because he has handed out emergency aid to 67m hard-up Brazilians, but his macho posturing also appeals to many voters. He caught covid-19 and recovered, crediting his background as an athlete. He declared: ""We have to face [the virus] like a man, damn it, not like a little boy."" He blames state governors for being so scared of the disease that they wreck people's livelihoods unnecessarily.
That strikes a chord with some. When Sāo Paulo's lockdown was at its tightest, a clothing shop was illegally letting customers in through a tiny metal shutter door. ""The governors shut things down to hurt the economy and make Bolsonaro look bad,"" grumbled the owner, who shared his president's dismissive attitude towards covid-19. ""The death numbers are a lie,"" he said: ""I'm only wearing this mask out of respect for our clients. I don't need it.""
Strongmen find it easier to impress the masses when they control the news. In April Reporters Without Borders, a watchdog, counted 38 countries using the coronavirus as an excuse to harass critical media. That number has now more than doubled, to 91, says Freedom House.
Many governments have criminalised ""fake news"" about the pandemic. Often, this means commentary that displeases the ruling party. Nicaragua's regime plans to ban news that ""causes alarm, fear or anxiety"". El Salvador has relaunched a state television outlet, having purged 70 journalists since President Nayib Bukele came to power last year. ""I am watching a very balanced newscast,"" grinned Mr Bukele. ""I don't know what the opposition will see.""
Anyone in Zimbabwe who publishes or disseminates ""false"" information about an official, or that impedes the response to the pandemic, faces up to 20 years in prison. Two journalists were arrested when they tried to visit in hospital three opposition activists, including an mp, who had been abducted, tortured and forced to drink urine by ruling-party thugs.
All around the world, ordinary people are being gagged, too. Some 116 citizen journalists are currently imprisoned, says Reporters Without Borders. In Uzbekistan people entering quarantine facilities have had to hand over their phones, supposedly to prevent the devices from spreading the virus but actually so they cannot take photos of the woeful conditions inside.
Medics, who see covid-19 fiascos close up, face extra pressure to shut up. China's rulers silenced the doctors in Wuhan who first sounded the alarm about the new virus. Censorship can be lethal. Had China listened to doctors and acted faster to curb the disease, it would not have spread so fast around the world.
Still, other regimes have copied China's example. In September the Turkish Medical Association accused Turkey's government of downplaying the outbreak. A ruling-party ally called for the group to be shut down and its leaders investigated for stoking ""panic"". Yet the doctors were right. The health ministry later admitted that its daily figures did not include asymptomatic patients. An opposition lawmaker shared a document suggesting that the true number of cases in a single day in September was 19 times the official tally.
Egypt's government says it is coping admirably with the pandemic. A dozen doctors have been arrested for suggesting otherwise, as have several journalists. One, Mohamed Monir, died of covid-19 contracted during detention.
Of the 24 countries that had national elections scheduled between January and August, nine were disrupted by the pandemic. Some delays were justified. But as South Korea showed, a ballot can be held safely if suitable precautions are taken. Some other governments were in no hurry. Sri Lanka's President Gotabaya Rajapaksa dissolved the opposition-controlled parliament in March and did not allow fresh elections until August. In the meantime, he ran the country without lawmakers to check him.
In Hong Kong pro-democracy candidates were expected to do well in elections in September. Citing the risk of covid-19, the territory's pro-communist leaders delayed them for a year.
Burundi's election in May was probably never going to be clean, but the virus supplied the perfect excuse to exclude pesky foreign observers. Twelve days before the election they were told that they would have to quarantine on arrival in the country for 14 days, thus missing the vote.
In Russia Vladimir Putin has turned the virus to his advantage. He shifted responsibility for a strict lockdown to regional governors, but then took credit for easing it. In the summer he held a constitutional pseudo-referendum to allow himself to stay in office until 2036. Citing public health, he extended the vote to a week and allowed people to vote at home, in courtyards, in playgrounds and on tree stumps. The vote was impossible to observe or verify. Mr Putin declared a resounding victory. Parliament voted to change the voting procedure permanently.
In countries with too few checks and balances, rules to curb the virus can be used for other ends. On a dark road in Senegal, a policeman recently stopped a taxi and detained the driver for wearing his anti-covid mask on his chin. After 45 minutes, shaking with fury, the driver returned to his vehicle. The cop had threatened him with dire punishments unless he handed over some cash, he explained to his passenger, a reporter for The Economist. He drove off as fast as he could, cursing.
While petty officials abuse the rules to pad their wages, strongmen typically abuse them to crush dissent. Police assaulted civilians in 59 countries and detained them in 66 for reasons linked to the pandemic. Violence was most common in countries Freedom House classifies as ""partly free"", where people are not yet too scared to protest, but their rulers would like them to be.
In Zimbabwe, for example, many of the 34 new regulations passed during a national lockdown are still in place, and have been used as a pretext for myriad abuses. In September the Zimbabwe Human Rights ngo Forum, an umbrella group, released a report listing 920 cases of torture, extrajudicial killings, unlawful arrests and assaults on citizens by the security services in the first 180 days of lockdown. One man was forced to roll around in raw sewage. Many had dogs set on them. Dozens of opposition activists have been arrested or beaten, including a former finance minister. There were too many everyday cases of intimidation and harassment to count.
Many strongmen are also chipping away at pre-pandemic checks on their power. Nicaragua has borrowed an idea from Mr Putin: a law will require ngos that receive foreign funding to register as ""foreign agents"". India used similar rules to shut down the local arm of Amnesty International, which closed in September after its bank accounts were frozen.
In Kazakhstan trials are taking place on Zoom, leading some defendants in politically charged cases to complain that this makes it easy for judges to have selective hearing. Alnur Ilyashev, a pro-democracy campaigner who was sentenced to three years of restricted movement for ""disseminating false information"", said he could not always hear his own trial.
Nothing spreads like fear
Panic about a contagious disease makes people irrational and xenophobic. A study in 2015 by Huggy Rao of Stanford University and Sunasir Dutta of the University of Minnesota found that people were less likely to favour legalising irregular immigrants if told about a new strain of flu. Many autocrats, even if they have not read the academic literature, grasp that blaming outgroups is a good way to win support.
Mr Modi's government tars Muslims as superspreaders. Bulgaria imposed harsher lockdowns on Romany neighbourhoods than on others. Turkey's religious authorities blame gay people. Malaysian officials blame migrant workers, some of whom have been caned and deported.
Minorities have had an especially grim time in Myanmar. Aung San Suu Kyi, the country's de facto president, threatened severe penalties for residents who re-enter the country illegally. People understood this to refer to the Rohingyas, a persecuted Muslim group, roughly 1m of whom have fled into neighbouring countries. The rumour that Rohingyas were infecting the nation spread rapidly. A cartoon circulating online showed a Rohingya man, labelled as an ""illegal interloper"", crossing the border, carrying covid-19.
Meanwhile, a un rapporteur warns that the pandemic has ""emboldened"" Myanmar's army, which has stepped up its war on secessionists. The Arakan Army, a rebel group, offered ceasefires in April, June and September; all were rebuffed. In May and June the army bombed civilians, razed villages and tortured non-combatants, says Amnesty International. Some 200,000 have fled to camps for displaced people, according to a local ngo, the Rakhine Ethnics Congress. Since covid-19 struck, donations have declined and supplies of food to the camps have dwindled.
Abusers and autocrats have not had it all their own way this year. The pandemic has drained their treasuries. Their finances will still be wobbly even when a vaccine is found and the public-health excuse for curbs on freedom is no longer plausible.
And people are pushing back. Although 158 countries have imposed restrictions on demonstrations, big protests have erupted in at least 90 since the pandemic began. Furious crowds in Kyrgyzstan this month forced the government to order a re-run of a tainted election. Protests in Nigeria prompted the government to disband a notoriously torture-and-murder-prone police unit on October 11th. Mass rallies in Belarus have so far failed to reverse a rigged election there, but have made it clear that the dictator, Alexander Lukashenko, has lost the consent of his people.
Institutions are pushing back, too. A court in Lesotho barred the prime minister from using the virus as an excuse to close parliament. Russia's opposition parties refuse to be cowed even by the poisoning of their main leader, Alexei Navalny.
With luck, when covid-19 eventually recedes, the global atmosphere of fear will recede with it. People may find the capacity to care a bit more about abuses that occur far away, or to people unlike themselves. They may even elect leaders who speak up for universal values. But for the time being, the outlook is grim. *","Covid-19 and liberty

So has Rodrigo Duterte in the Philippines , despite the largest reported caseload in South - East Asia . Mr Duterte 's poll numbers may be coloured by fear ; he has had thousands of people , supposedly criminal suspects , killed without trial , a campaign that appears to have intensified during the pandemic . But many Filipinos admire his grim style - extending a "" state of calamity "" for another year last month , temporarily banning many nurses from going to work overseas and vowing to try the first covid-19 vaccine himself to show it is safe . 
 Popular , you 're gon na be popular 
 Admiration for Jair Bolsonaro's , is as high as ever , despite over 5 m covid-19 cases and more than 150,000 deaths . This is partly because Jair Bolsonaro has handed out emergency aid to 67 m hard - up Brazilians , but Jair Bolsonaro's macho posturing also appeals to many voters . Jair Bolsonaro caught covid-19 and recovered , crediting Jair Bolsonaro's background as an athlete . Jair Bolsonaro declared : "" We have to face [ the virus ] like a man , damn it , not like a little boy . "" Jair Bolsonaro blames state governors for being so scared of the disease that they wreck people 's livelihoods unnecessarily . 
 That strikes a chord with some . When Sāo Paulo 's lockdown was at its tightest , a clothing shop was illegally letting customers in through a tiny metal shutter door . "" The governors shut things down to hurt the economy and make Jair Bolsonaro look bad , "" grumbled the owner , who shared Jair Bolsonaro's dismissive attitude towards covid-19 . "" The death numbers are a lie , "" he said : "" I 'm only wearing this mask out of respect for our clients . I do n't need it . "" 
 Strongmen find it easier to impress the masses when they control the news . In April Reporters Without Borders , a watchdog , counted 38 countries using the coronavirus as an excuse to harass critical media . That number has now more than doubled , to 91 , says Freedom House . 
 Many governments have criminalised "" fake news "" about the pandemic . Often , this means commentary that displeases the ruling party . Nicaragua 's regime plans to ban news that "" causes alarm , fear or anxiety "" . El Salvador has relaunched a state television outlet , having purged 70 journalists since President Nayib Bukele came to power last year . "" I am watching a very balanced newscast , "" grinned Mr Bukele . "" I do n't know what the opposition will see . "" 
 Anyone in Zimbabwe who publishes or disseminates "" false "" information about an official , or that impedes the response to the pandemic , faces up to 20 years in prison . Two journalists were arrested when they tried to visit in hospital three opposition activists , including an mp , who had been abducted , tortured and forced to drink urine by ruling - party thugs . 
 All around the world , ordinary people are being gagged , too . Some 116 citizen journalists are currently imprisoned , says Reporters Without Borders . In Uzbekistan people entering quarantine facilities have had to hand over their phones , supposedly to prevent the devices from spreading the virus but actually so they can not take photos of the woeful conditions inside . 
 Medics , who see covid-19 fiascos close up , face extra pressure to shut up . China 's rulers silenced the doctors in Wuhan who first sounded the alarm about the new virus . Censorship can be lethal . Had China listened to doctors and acted faster to curb the disease , it would not have spread so fast around the world . 
 Still , other regimes have copied China 's example . In September the Turkish Medical Association accused Turkey 's government of downplaying the outbreak . A ruling - party ally called for the group to be shut down and its leaders investigated for stoking "" panic "" . Yet the doctors were right . The health ministry later admitted that its daily figures did not include asymptomatic patients . An opposition lawmaker shared a document suggesting that the true number of cases in a single day in September was 19 times the official tally . 
 Egypt 's government says it is coping admirably with the pandemic . A dozen doctors have been arrested for suggesting otherwise , as have several journalists . One , Mohamed Monir , died of covid-19 contracted during detention . 
 Of the 24 countries that had national elections scheduled between January and August , nine were disrupted by the pandemic . Some delays were justified . But as South Korea showed , a ballot can be held safely if suitable precautions are taken . Some other governments were in no hurry . Sri Lanka 's President Gotabaya Rajapaksa dissolved the opposition - controlled parliament in March and did not allow fresh elections until August . In the meantime , he ran the country without lawmakers to check him . 
 In Hong Kong pro - democracy candidates were expected to do well in elections in September . Citing the risk of covid-19 , the territory 's pro - communist leaders delayed them for a year . 
 Burundi 's election in May was probably never going to be clean , but the virus supplied the perfect excuse to exclude pesky foreign observers . Twelve days before the election they were told that they would have to quarantine on arrival in the country for 14 days , thus missing the vote . 
 In Russia Vladimir Putin has turned the virus to his advantage . He shifted responsibility for a strict lockdown to regional governors , but then took credit for easing it . In the summer he held a constitutional pseudo - referendum to allow himself to stay in office until 2036 . Citing public health , he extended the vote to a week and allowed people to vote at home , in courtyards , in playgrounds and on tree stumps . The vote was impossible to observe or verify . Mr Putin declared a resounding victory . Parliament voted to change the voting procedure permanently . 
 In countries with too few checks and balances , rules to curb the virus can be used for other ends . On a dark road in Senegal , a policeman recently stopped a taxi and detained the driver for wearing his anti - covid mask on his chin . After 45 minutes , shaking with fury , the driver returned to his vehicle . The cop had threatened him with dire punishments unless he handed over some cash , he explained to his passenger , a reporter for The Economist . He drove off as fast as he could , cursing . 
 While petty officials abuse the rules to pad their wages , strongmen typically abuse them to crush dissent . Police assaulted civilians in 59 countries and detained them in 66 for reasons linked to the pandemic . Violence was most common in countries Freedom House classifies as "" partly free "" , where people are not yet too scared to protest , but their rulers would like them to be . 
 In Zimbabwe , for example , many of the 34 new regulations passed during a national lockdown are still in place , and have been used as a pretext for myriad abuses . In September the Zimbabwe Human Rights ngo Forum , an umbrella group , released a report listing 920 cases of torture , extrajudicial killings , unlawful arrests and assaults on citizens by the security services in the first 180 days of lockdown . One man was forced to roll around in raw sewage . Many had dogs set on them . Dozens of opposition activists have been arrested or beaten , including a former finance minister . There were too many everyday cases of intimidation and harassment to count . 
 Many strongmen are also chipping away at pre - pandemic checks on their power . Nicaragua has borrowed an idea from Mr Putin : a law will require ngos that receive foreign funding to register as "" foreign agents "" . India used similar rules to shut down the local arm of Amnesty International , which closed in September after its bank accounts were frozen . 
 In Kazakhstan trials are taking place on Zoom , leading some defendants in politically charged cases to complain that this makes it easy for judges to have selective hearing . Alnur Ilyashev , a pro - democracy campaigner who was sentenced to three years of restricted movement for "" disseminating false information "" , said he could not always hear his own trial . 
 Nothing spreads like fear 
 Panic about a contagious disease makes people irrational and xenophobic . A study in 2015 by Huggy Rao of Stanford University and Sunasir Dutta of the University of Minnesota found that people were less likely to favour legalising irregular immigrants if told about a new strain of flu . Many autocrats , even if they have not read the academic literature , grasp that blaming outgroups is a good way to win support . 
 Mr Modi 's government tars Muslims as superspreaders . Bulgaria imposed harsher lockdowns on Romany neighbourhoods than on others . Turkey 's religious authorities blame gay people . Malaysian officials blame migrant workers , some of whom have been caned and deported . 
 Minorities have had an especially grim time in Myanmar . Aung San Suu Kyi , the country 's de facto president , threatened severe penalties for residents who re - enter the country illegally . People understood this to refer to the Rohingyas , a persecuted Muslim group , roughly 1 m of whom have fled into neighbouring countries . The rumour that Rohingyas were infecting the nation spread rapidly . A cartoon circulating online showed a Rohingya man , labelled as an "" illegal interloper "" , crossing the border , carrying covid-19 . 
 Meanwhile , a un rapporteur warns that the pandemic has "" emboldened "" Myanmar 's army , which has stepped up its war on secessionists . The Arakan Army , a rebel group , offered ceasefires in April , June and September ; all were rebuffed . In May and June the army bombed civilians , razed villages and tortured non - combatants , says Amnesty International . Some 200,000 have fled to camps for displaced people , according to a local ngo , the Rakhine Ethnics Congress . Since covid-19 struck , donations have declined and supplies of food to the camps have dwindled . 
 Abusers and autocrats have not had it all their own way this year . The pandemic has drained their treasuries . Their finances will still be wobbly even when a vaccine is found and the public - health excuse for curbs on freedom is no longer plausible . 
 And people are pushing back . Although 158 countries have imposed restrictions on demonstrations , big protests have erupted in at least 90 since the pandemic began . Furious crowds in Kyrgyzstan this month forced the government to order a re - run of a tainted election . Protests in Nigeria prompted the government to disband a notoriously torture - and - murder - prone police unit on October 11th . Mass rallies in Belarus have so far failed to reverse a rigged election there , but have made it clear that the dictator , Alexander Lukashenko , has lost the consent of his people . 
 Institutions are pushing back , too . A court in Lesotho barred the prime minister from using the virus as an excuse to close parliament . Russia 's opposition parties refuse to be cowed even by the poisoning of their main leader , Alexei Navalny . 
 With luck , when covid-19 eventually recedes , the global atmosphere of fear will recede with it . People may find the capacity to care a bit more about abuses that occur far away , or to people unlike themselves . They may even elect leaders who speak up for universal values . But for the time being , the outlook is grim . *",140,Brazil,ctb-140-2,IN TERM,True,"Jair Bolsonaro , Brazil 's militaristic president",9,True

Months of frantic electioneering, $13.9bn of campaign spending, a raging pandemic and mass protests over race: in spite of all the sweat and tears, America was still determining as we went to press if its next president really would be Joe Biden or whether Donald Trump might somehow wrangle a second term. Congress is likely to be split between a Democratic House and a Republican Senate-though even that result may remain in doubt until a run-off in January.
In the coming days politicians should take their cue from voters, who turned out in greater force than in any year since 1900 and who made their choice without violence. Vote-counting must run its course and disputes between the two campaigns be settled within the spirit of the law. The biggest threat to that comes from Mr Trump, who used his election-night party to claim falsely that he had already won, and to fire up his supporters by warning that victory was being stolen from him. Coming from a man sworn to safeguard America's constitution, such incitement was a reminder why many, including this newspaper, had called for voters to repudiate Mr Trump wholesale.
With Mr Biden's victory they would take a crucial first step in that direction. Only once in the past 40 years has a president been denied a second term. Mr Trump will lose the popular vote by, we reckon, 52% to 47%-only the electoral college's bias towards rural voters saved him from a crushing defeat. That is a repudiation of sorts.
A Biden White House would also set a wholly new tone. The all-caps tweets and the constant needling of partisan divisions would go. So would the self-dealing, the habitual lying and the use of government departments to pursue personal vendettas. Mr Biden is a decent man who, after the polls closed, vowed to govern as a unifier. His victory would change American policy in areas from climate to immigration. That is a form of repudiation, too.
And yet the unexpected closeness of the vote also means populism will live on in America. With this election it has become clear that Mr Trump's astonishing victory in 2016 was not an aberration but the start of a profound ideological shift in his party (see Lexington). Defying expectations and covid-19, he has won millions more votes in the huge turnout of 2020 than he did in 2016's moderate one. Far from being swept away in a blue wave, Republicans have gained seats in the House and seem set to keep control of the Senate. The Republican Party, which fell under Mr Trump's spell while he was in office, is not about to shake itself out of the trance now. It is even conceivable that Mr Trump, or a member of his family, could run for the White House in 2024.
The outside world, which has been watching this contest with rapt attention, will draw two conclusions from America's failure to reject Trumpism more decisively. The first will be among populist nationalists who look to Mr Trump for inspiration and who will now reckon that their brand of politics has a brighter future outside America, too. An abject defeat for Mr Trump may have spelled trouble for politicians like Jair Bolsonaro in Brazil and Marine Le Pen in France. Instead Nigel Farage, formerly the leader of the Brexit Party, is busy planning his comeback (see Britain section). The persistence of Mr Trump's support suggests that the rejection of immigration, urban elites and globalisation, which gathered pace after the financial crisis of 2008-09, still has further to run.
The second conclusion is to be wary of relying on America. Mr Trump has been a disruptive, transactional force in foreign affairs, contemptuous of alliances and multilateralism. Mr Biden, by contrast, is steeped in the traditional values of American diplomacy from his time in the Senate. He would doubtless seek to restore close ties with allies and to strengthen global governance, by for instance, remaining in the World Health Organisation and rejoining the Paris agreement on climate change. But after this election result, everyone will know that it could all revert again in 2024.
At home the picture is more complicated, but it contains lessons for both parties-and for their stewardship of America. The hardest message is for the Democrats. Their failure to take the Senate means that Mr Biden will struggle to pass bills or appoint judges. An infrastructure bill, health-care reform and environmental laws could all be blocked by Congress.
That failure partly reflects the Democrats' inability to attract white, non-college-educated voters, especially in rural America. They also fared less well than expected among young AfricanAmerican men and Hispanic voters in Florida and Texas. These losses undermine the Democrats' assumption that, just because America is becoming less white and more suburban, they are destined to win elections. Rather, they will need to earn support by countering Republican claims that they are against free enterprise and that fringe obsessions with identity politics are becoming an oppressive Democratic orthodoxy.
Republicans face lessons, too. Trumpism has its limits. If they block all legislation in the Senate so as to discredit Mr Biden, it will mark yet another electoral cycle in which the gridlock and the zero-sum logic of partisanship prevent America from grappling with its problems. Republicans will tell themselves that discrediting the Washington machine helps the party that claims to stand for limited government-however swampy the Trump administration proved. That view is as short-sighted as it is cynical.
Red-lesson day
Those black and Hispanic voters who came over to their side this week suggest that Republicans can win minority support and that ethnic groups are not monoliths. Republicans are seduced by a dangerous identity politics of their own, which stirs up white fears of a multiracial country. How much better if they made a positive case for their party, seeking to expand their base by earning their share of the credit for, say, bills to reform criminal justice or upgrade America's creaking infrastructure.
This election has once again shown that America is a divided nation. Many of its politicians set out to feed the divisions, and none has divided more than Mr Trump. We hope that his defeat will stand as a lesson that it doesn't always work.","What the 2020 results say about America's future
Months of frantic electioneering, $13.9bn of campaign spending, a raging pandemic and mass protests over race: in spite of all the sweat and tears, America was still determining as we went to press if its next president really would be Joe Biden or whether Donald Trump might somehow wrangle a second term. Congress is likely to be split between a Democratic House and a Republican Senate-though even that result may remain in doubt until a run-off in January.
In the coming days politicians should take their cue from voters, who turned out in greater force than in any year since 1900 and who made their choice without violence. Vote-counting must run its course and disputes between the two campaigns be settled within the spirit of the law. The biggest threat to that comes from Mr Trump, who used his election-night party to claim falsely that he had already won, and to fire up his supporters by warning that victory was being stolen from him. Coming from a man sworn to safeguard America's constitution, such incitement was a reminder why many, including this newspaper, had called for voters to repudiate Mr Trump wholesale.

After the pandemic struck Chile, ten do-gooding organisations formed Fondo Respuesta Comunitaria (the Community Response Fund) to alleviate hunger and poverty. It provides money for some 200 projects, mostly ollas comunes (soup kitchens). In Colombia the Fundación Santo Domingo is giving 100bn pesos ($26m) to pay for groceries and a domestic-abuse hotline, among other things. The Fundación Carlos Slim, backed by Mexico's richest man, earmarked 1bn pesos ($47m) to treat covid-19 in that country.
The pandemic has given a boost to philanthropy in Latin America, but it is also a threat. Donors have less money to give or are shifting it to public health from other good causes. Almost half of ngos in Chile may not survive, fears Sylvia Eyzaguirre of the Centro de Estudios Públicos, a think-tank. Prospects are as gloomy in Colombia, where many charities depend on events like galas and bingo nights, which cannot happen in covid times. In too many countries bureaucracy and politics add to the burdens. For the sake of its political and social health, Latin America needs more charitable activity, not less.
Philanthropy is fragile in part because it is less deeply rooted than elsewhere, notably the United States and Europe. In colonial times the Catholic church cured the sick and helped the poor. Centralising states took over such responsibilities, though not as effectively as in the rich world. ""Philanthropy and [civilsociety] associations were sort of a minor tributary and not part of the main story of development of those nations,"" says Michael Layton of the Johnson Centre for Philanthropy at Grand Valley State University in Michigan.
They remain weak. The Latin American countries with the largest philanthropic sectors are Mexico and Colombia, according to a study published in 2018. There foundations' assets are worth 1% of annual gdp, compared with 4.8% in the United States. Ordinary folk seem less altruistic than in other regions, though the tradition of almsgiving through the church remains strong. In a global giving index put together by the Charities Aid Foundation, the only Latin American country in the top 20 is Haiti.
The region pays a high price for low levels of generosity. The population of non-profit universities, museums, birdwatching clubs and the like is sparse. Unlike in the rich world, governments do not give them much money. Worldwide, non-profits account for 5.7% of employment; in Mexico, Colombia and Peru that is 3% or less, according to Lester Salamon of Johns Hopkins University in Maryland.
Latin America has too few groups that channel citizens' grievances into proposals that governments might adopt, making conflict more likely. If the rich, who are undertaxed, gave away more money, high levels of inequality might rankle less.
Recently they have become more open-handed. More than half the region's philanthropic groups have been founded since 2000, according to a study published by the Universidad del Pacífico in Peru. But the law, and increasingly politics, throw up obstacles. In many countries registering a charity is difficult. Chile has some 60 laws governing the tax treatment of donations. Donors can give tax-free money to cultural institutions but not to environmental or human-rights groups.
There is a push to change that in Chile, made more urgent by last year's violent protests against inequality and poor public services. Left- and rightleaning think-tanks are lobbying together for a law to make giving easier.
Where authoritarians rule, life is getting harder for groups that benefit from philanthropy. Jair Bolsonaro, Brazil's right-wing president, has made rhetorical war on defenders of the environment. Mexico's left-wing president, Andrés Manuel López Obrador, has attacked environmental groups that oppose pet infrastructure projects, such as the Maya train across the Yucatán peninsula. This month Mexico's Senate passed a law to strip tax-exempt status from groups that get most of their income from activities not related to their charitable goals. That would hurt groups like universities that make ends meet by, for example, operating bookshops. The bill is ""a profound attack on the independence of non-profits"", says Mr Layton.
Weakening do-gooders may make life more comfortable for high-handed presidents like Messrs Bolsonaro and López Obrador. But a region traumatised by pandemic and rising poverty needs more philanthropy, not less.","Latin American has too little philanthropy

For all Donald Trump's efforts to overturn this month's election, American democracy never looked likely to buckle after polling day. Sure enough, on November 23rd, even as the president once again condemned ""the most corrupt election in American history"", he agreed that the federal government should give Joe Biden the resources he needs to prepare for office.
Mr Trump has still done harm, as have the Republican leaders who indulged him (see Lexington). Given that four in every five Republican voters say the vote was ""stolen"", trust in the fairness of elections has been shaken and Mr Biden unjustly undermined from the very start. Henceforth in close votes routine jobs like counting and certifying votes will risk being part of the battleground. That is not a threat to the republic's existence, but it does mark a further partisan deterioration in American democracy.
It is also part of a global democratic recession. The collapse of the Soviet Union led to a flourishing in the number and quality of liberal democracies, but the trend has now gone into reverse. Hungary and Poland are blocking the European Union budget because their governments refuse to bow to the rule of law (see Charlemagne). Our briefing describes how in the world's largest democracy the Bharatiya Janata Party (bjp) under Narendra Modi is capturing institutions, including the courts, the police and now, it is feared, the election commission. The Economist Intelligence Unit (eiu), our sister organisation, has been compiling a democracy index since 2006. Last year's score was the worst ever. Covid-19 has accelerated the decline.
The threat is not from military coups but governments in power. Given time, unscrupulous leaders can hollow out democracy completely. Two decades ago Venezuela held meaningful elections; today it is about to eliminate the last kernel of opposition (see Americas section). But even in countries where such a calamity is unthinkable, the erosion of norms and institutions leads to worse government. To reverse this, you have to understand what has gone wrong.
Whether you support them or not, Mr Trump and his fellow populists came to power as a response to the failings of democratic governments. In rich countries working-class voters came to believe that politicians did not care about them, after their living standards stagnated and they became worried about immigration. In central and eastern Europe governments seeking to join the eu paid more heed to Brussels than their own voters. In developing countries corruption sent the message that the ruling classes were chiefly interested in their own bank accounts.
Enterprising politicians responded to these feelings by elevating identity far above policy so as to show voters that their grievances matter. Such was the upheaval that some old parties were swept away-in France in 2017 they won just a quarter of the vote between them. Poland had thrived under a centrist government, but Law and Justice told voters that their Catholic values were under attack from Brussels. In Brazil Jair Bolsonaro endorsed voters' contempt for the political class (see Bello). So relentless is Mr Trump's focus on the identity of his base that he did not even propose a programme for his second term.
Identity politics, boosted by social media and partisan television and radio, has re-engaged voters. Participation is the only component of the eiu's democracy index to have improved since 2006. Mr Biden and Mr Trump both won more votes than any presidential candidates in history. But in solving one of democracy's problems, identity politics has created others.
That is because a politics that reinforces immutable identities leads away from the tolerance and forbearance a democracy needs to solve social conflicts. In arguments about who gets what, people can split the difference and feel content. In arguments about who they are-over religion, race and anti-elitism, say-compromise can seem like betrayal. When ways of life are at stake the other lot are not just mistaken, they are dangerous. Having not mattered enough, elections now matter too much.
In some countries majoritarian leaders have exploited this tribal loyalty to nobble the institutions supposed to check them. In Turkey Recep Tayyip Erdogan governs as if democratic power is absolute and condemns those who block him as enemies of the republic. In Mexico Andrés Manuel López Obrador sidesteps entire branches of government, which have supposedly been captured by the elites, and appeals directly to his supporters in referendums. In India, when the electoral commission pursued bjp candidates less scrupulously than their opponents, one of the three top commissioners objected-only to find his family investigated for tax evasion.
America's institutions are protected by the professionalism of its judges and officials. Many of them feel bound by standards laid down by those who came before them. When Mr Trump tried to subvert the election, he failed abjectly because countless people did their duty.
As a result, the main harm identity politics does to America comes through animosity and gridlock. Politics is supposed to resolve society's conflicts, but democracy is generating them instead. Partly because tribes live in different information universes, matters of fact like wearing masks and climate change are transformed into disputes about people's way of life. The result is that American politics has once again become unresponsive. It fires people up so much that it obstructs the compromises needed for society to move forward.
Vote for change
Some warn that the discontent this creates will cause democracies to die-an outcome that its foes, championed by Vladimir Putin, have schemed to bring about. And yet, there are plenty of reasons to hope. One of democracy's strengths is that it promises lots of chances to start again. So long as elections take place, there is always the possibility of kicking the rascals out even in places where governments stack the vote. In the cities of Hungary and Poland voters have begun to reject repression and cronyism. In eu elections last year populists did worse than expected. Perhaps the pendulum has already begun to swing. India is too vast and too diverse for a single party to rule on its own.
Democracy is adaptable, too. In America's election Republicans picked up Hispanic and black votes; and in Britain last year 1 the governing Conservative Party won Labour seats in the Midlands. That mixing is just what politics in both countries needs, because it encourages parties on the left and right to break out of their tribal redoubts and to tilt the balance of political effort away from identity and back towards outcomes.
Democracy is, for good or ill, also linked to the fortunes of the superpower that is most closely tied to it. America supports democracy partly through example and advocacy. At home Mr Biden will attempt to restore norms such as the independence of the Justice Department. Abroad, he will not indulge autocrats and tyrants as much as Mr Trump has. And America could boost democracy through power politics. If Mr Biden wants to create an alliance to help America keep ahead in the race against China for tech dominance, democracy will help define it.
Above all, democracy is something people strive for. Every weekend Belarusians risk their liberty and their lives by taking to the streets to defy the dictator who refuses them the right to choose who should govern them, just as Hong Kongers, Sudanese and Thais have. It is an inspiration that voters everywhere should carry with them to the ballot box. *","Although it has been in recession, democracy contains the seeds of its own recovery
For all Donald Trump's efforts to overturn this month's election, American democracy never looked likely to buckle after polling day. Sure enough, on November 23rd, even as the president once again condemned ""the most corrupt election in American history"", he agreed that the federal government should give Joe Biden the resources he needs to prepare for office.
Mr Trump has still done harm, as have the Republican leaders who indulged him (see Lexington). Given that four in every five Republican voters say the vote was ""stolen"", trust in the fairness of elections has been shaken and Mr Biden unjustly undermined from the very start. Henceforth in close votes routine jobs like counting and certifying votes will risk being part of the battleground. That is not a threat to the republic's existence, but it does mark a further partisan deterioration in American democracy.
It is also part of a global democratic recession. The collapse of the Soviet Union led to a flourishing in the number and quality of liberal democracies, but the trend has now gone into reverse. Hungary and Poland are blocking the European Union budget because their governments refuse to bow to the rule of law (see Charlemagne). Our briefing describes how in the world's largest democracy the Bharatiya Janata Party (bjp) under Narendra Modi is capturing institutions, including the courts, the police and now, it is feared, the election commission. The Economist Intelligence Unit (eiu), our sister organisation, has been compiling a democracy index since 2006. Last year's score was the worst ever. Covid-19 has accelerated the decline.
The threat is not from military coups but governments in power. Given time, unscrupulous leaders can hollow out democracy completely. Two decades ago Venezuela held meaningful elections; today it is about to eliminate the last kernel of opposition (see Americas section). But even in countries where such a calamity is unthinkable, the erosion of norms and institutions leads to worse government. To reverse this, you have to understand what has gone wrong.
Whether you support them or not, Mr Trump and his fellow populists came to power as a response to the failings of democratic governments. In rich countries working-class voters came to believe that politicians did not care about them, after their living standards stagnated and they became worried about immigration. In central and eastern Europe governments seeking to join the eu paid more heed to Brussels than their own voters. In developing countries corruption sent the message that the ruling classes were chiefly interested in their own bank accounts.
Enterprising politicians responded to these feelings by elevating identity far above policy so as to show voters that their grievances matter. Such was the upheaval that some old parties were swept away-in France in 2017 they won just a quarter of the vote between them. Poland had thrived under a centrist government, but Law and Justice told voters that their Catholic values were under attack from Brussels. In Brazil Jair Bolsonaro endorsed voters' contempt for the political class (see Bello). So relentless is Mr Trump's focus on the identity of his base that he did not even propose a programme for his second term.
Identity politics, boosted by social media and partisan television and radio, has re-engaged voters. Participation is the only component of the eiu's democracy index to have improved since 2006.

THIS HAS been a bad month for Brazil's populist president, Jair Bolsonaro. First, Donald Trump, whose victory in 2016 served as a template for his own and with whom he aligned his government, lost his bid for a second term. And then the candidates Mr Bolsonaro backed in municipal elections on November 15th nearly all fared poorly, while the big winners were mainstream parties. Some pundits are rushing to write his political obituary. ""The elections of 2018 were a hiatus and those of 2020 have put things back in their right place,"" wrote Eliane Cantanhede, the political columnist of O Estado de S. Paulo, a newspaper.
Brazilian liberals hope she is right, and that Mr Trump's defeat will be an augury of Mr Bolsonaro's fate at the next election in 2022. A former army captain, Mr Bolsonaro is scornful of democracy and its checks and balances, has stuffed his government with military men, says offensive things about gay, feminist and black Brazilians, favours gun ownership and underplays both covid-19 and climate change. His election broke the mould of Brazilian politics and was in some ways an aberration. Even so, it would be a mistake to write off his chances of a second term.
In 2018 Mr Bolsonaro was the beneficiary of an unusual moment in which the country's political class was widely seen to have failed. His chief opponent, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, a once idolised former president, was in jail, barred from running by a conviction for bribe-taking in the so-called Lava Jato (Car Wash) scandal. Lula's left-wing Workers' Party was seen by many not just as corrupt and self-serving but incompetent, having driven the economy into what was then its deepest recession in a century. But the opprobrium extended to centrist politicians, many of whom were caught up in Lava Jato.
Mr Bolsonaro, who posed as an antipolitical outsider, tapped into conservative currents in Brazilian society, some long present, some newer. He attracted disproportionate support from men and evangelical Protestants. But what tipped the election to him was the popularity of his talk about family values and law and order in the poor peripheries of Brazil's big cities, the Workers' Party's former base, argues a recent book by Jairo Nicolau, a political scientist. His victory owed much to the skilful use of social media in a way that was novel in a Brazilian election.
As president, Mr Bolsonaro empowered hard-right ideologues, pursued polarisation and all but self-destructed. Six months ago, amid rising tension caused by the pandemic, corruption allegations against one of his sons and threats of impeachment, he came close to ordering the armed forces to shut down the Supreme Court. Some of his military advisers talked him out of that. Mr Bolsonaro saved his presidency by edging away from antipolitics and towards conservative politics as usual, allying with the centrāo (big centre), a clutch of conservative parties of professional politicians who hold 221 of the 513 seats in Congress. An emergency stipend paid to 66m people has blunted criticism of his mishandling of the pandemic. Brazil has had more than 6m confirmed cases and 170,000 deaths. Mr Bolsonaro's approval rating has risen from 30% to 40%.
His most likely path to a second term involves cementing his alliance with the centrāo, which did well in the municipal elections. His attempts to set up his own political party, announced a year ago, have yet to bear fruit. An alliance with the centrāo would make him a much less credible campaigner against corruption and the political class. But it would offer the kind of political machine that historically helped to win Brazilian elections-useful since social media alone are unlikely to give him such a competitive edge twice. If the opposition remains divided both between left and centre and within those camps, that would help him, too.
The big problem for Mr Bolsonaro is the economy. The emergency stipend has helped the country avoid a deeper recession. But how long can the government sustain it? Public debt is heading for 100% of gdp. Even with interest rates low, that is a big number for a country with a history of default and inflation. Economic recovery may be slow and austerity looks unavoidable next year. Income per person has already fallen below its level of 2010. Many Brazilians are suffering. Nationalist sound and fury will not pay the bills. Mr Bolsonaro remains today a competitive candidate. But by 2022 Brazilians may be less receptive to him than they were in 2018.","Brazil 's weak economy stands between Jair Bolsonaro and a second term

Covid-19 has so far caused over 73m recorded infections and more than 1.6m recorded deaths. On January 23rd the Chinese authorities imposed a quarantine in Wuhan, soon extending it to the rest of Hubei province and beyond. Variants of this ""lockdown"" policy were adopted by other countries as they struggled to contain the outbreak.
Every breath you take
By late January cases were widely reported in Germany, Japan, Taiwan and Vietnam. Markets were rattled, fearing disruption to global supply chains that run through China. By late February the World Health Organisation said that most infections were occurring outside China. Italy was the first country to be hit hard. After hospitals were overwhelmed, the country went into lockdown in early March.
The sudden imposition of lockdowns led to panic buying in some places, notably in America and Britain, where supermarket shelves were stripped bare. Shopping moved online. Internet searches rocketed for goods such as toilet paper, fitness equipment and breadmakers. In poorer countries, such as India, the human cost was higher. Left suddenly without work, many migrant labourers tried to return to their family homes; it was the country's greatest movement of people since partition in 1947. India's economy shrank by around 25% in April-June.
By late March China was recording fewer domestic cases. The lockdown in Wuhan ended in early April. China closed its border to foreigners as the disease spread rapidly in Europe, most menacingly in Britain, France, Italy and Spain.
Don't stand so close to me
America was hit almost as hard by the coronavirus. Donald Trump didn't take it seriously at first; he tried to lift federal restrictions in April, promising a return to normality by Easter. Wearing a face mask became a badge of political allegiance. Mr Trump rowed with the who, accusing it of being in China's pocket, and said that America would leave it in 2021. Brazil was also led by a sceptic. Jair Bolsonaro said the disease was just a case of the ""sniffles"".
The extent of the market crash in mid-March (the s&p 500 lost a quarter of its value over three weeks) sparked fears of a depression. The Federal Reserve and other central banks made emergency cuts to interest rates. The Fed also propped up the corporate-bond market, action it had shied away from during the financial crisis a decade earlier.
Oil markets took a hammering. As if the pandemic were not enough of a problem, in March Saudi Arabia instigated a price war with Russia, as their deal over production levels broke down. Prices plunged in the steepest one-day decline since 1991. They eventually recovered somewhat. By the end of the year opec and Russia had struck a tentative agreement to increase supply.
Politicians in many countries pulled out their fiscal bazookas to defend their economies. America's Congress passed a $2.2trn stimulus bill (the cares act), which directed cash payments to households and topped up unemployment benefits. Some 21m people lost their jobs in April alone; unemployment soared to 14.7%, but it never hit the 20% that some had forecast. Britain guaranteed 80% of wages to workers who had been furloughed, and even subsidised restaurant meals in August.
Spirits in the material world
The pandemic was a boon for some. Once the shock of lockdowns faded, stockmarkets climbed towards new records, in part because of the soaring share prices of tech firms. Zoom meetings became a feature for office employees sent home to work remotely (Zoom fatigue was soon a common gripe). As online shopping flourished, Amazon recruited hundreds of thousands of extra staff. Jeff Bezos, Amazon's boss, saw his wealth increase from $111bn in March to $185bn in December. The combined wealth of the world's ten richest people grew by 57%, to $1.14trn.
Among industries, aviation and tourism were the biggest losers from the pandemic. Even with huge government bail-outs, airlines are reckoned to have lost $51obn in revenue, according to their international association. The un reported that international tourism declined by 70% in JanuaryAugust, causing a loss of $730bn in export revenues.
Scientists had what many thought to be a Herculean task developing a vaccine for covid-19, but drug firms made great strides and by the end of the year several jabs were ready. Britain started the first inoculation programme using a fully tested vaccine, followed soon after by America. Even with the vaccine, officials warn, the world will be battling the virus for another year.
The outbreak of civil war in Ethiopia was one of 2020's great disappointments. Abiy Ahmed, the prime minister and winner of a Nobel peace prize, launched an attack on the Tigray region when separatist forces attacked the army.
Chinese and Indian troops clashed along their Himalayan border, the first deadly encounter between the two sides in decades. Fighting also erupted between Armenia and Azerbaijan over the longdisputed enclave of NagornoKarabakh. Their truce is shaky.
Abe Shinzo, Japan's longestserving prime minister, stood down from office because of ill health. He was replaced by Suga Yoshihide, who is determined that the Tokyo Olympics will go ahead in July 2021.
China imposed a draconian national-security law on Hong Kong to crush anti-government unrest. It came into force just before the 23rd anniversary of the city's handover to China from British rule. Elections to the Legislative Council were postponed; pro-democracy candidates had been expected to do well. Opposition legislators resigned en masse in protest against the disbarring of colleagues.
De do do do, de da da da
America's presidential election was a rowdy affair. The Democratic primaries produced a surprise when Pete Buttigieg was declared the winner in Iowa; a delay in the count because of a technical glitch raised more questions about America's election machinery. Joe Biden cleaned up on Super Tuesday, and went on to win the presidency. Donald Trump, who was acquitted at his impeachment trial in February, resorted to more shenanigans, falsely claiming the result was fraudulent. He will be gone from the White House on January 20th 2021.
The death of George Floyd, a black man, at the hands of police in Minneapolis sparked the worst unrest across America for decades. Floyd's cry that he couldn't breathe to the officer kneeling on his neck reverberated around the world. The incident led to a surge in global support for Black Lives Matter and a reckoning with the legacy of slavery and colonialism. Toppling statues of white men was de rigueur for woke activists in many cities. America endured a summer of protest; notable flashpoints included Kenosha and Portland.
So lonely
Britain officially left the European Union on January 31st, entering a transition period that ends on December 31st. Talks about a trade deal dragged on. Whatever the outcome, Britons were told to expect delays when visiting the continent from now on.
Venezuelan troops intercepted two small boatloads of men who wanted to overthrow the country's dictator, Nicolás Maduro. ""Operation Gideon"" was led by two former members of America's special forces. Six of the invaders, a group of deserters and Maduro opponents, were executed.
Western intelligence fingered the Kremlin for trying to assassinate Alexei Navalny, Russia's main opposition leader. Poisoned by novichok, a nerve agent, Mr Navalny fell ill on a plane and was airlifted to Germany for treatment. He eventually recovered and later called on the eu to impose sanctions on high-ranking Russian oligarchs.
King of pain
Belarus was thrown into crisis when Alexander Lukashenko won a sixth term as president in another rigged election. Widespread protests were brutally suppressed by state goons, forcing opposition leaders to flee the country.
Israel's third election in less than a year led to a powersharing agreement, with Binyamin Netanyahu remaining as prime minister until November 2021. Israel also signed peace deals, brokered by the Trump administration, with the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain, Morocco and Sudan. Other Arab countries may follow.
In other noteworthy elections, Sinn Fein got the most votes at the polls in Ireland but came second in terms of seats. The country got its first-ever coalition government between Fianna Fail and Fine Gael. In Bolivia's twice-postponed election Luis Arce won the presidency. He is from the left but is viewed as a technocrat.
There was talk of war in the Gulf region after America assassinated Qassem Suleimani, Iran's foremost general, in a drone strike at Baghdad's airport in January. Five days later a Ukrainian airliner crashed after taking off from Tehran airport, killing all 176 people on board. Iran's armed forces later admitted that they had mistaken the plane for a missile and shot it down.
Parts of central Beirut were destroyed by a huge explosion, killing 200 people and injuring 6,500. A fire at the port ignited 2,750 tonnes of ammonium nitrate that had been stored and neglected for seven years. The blast, felt 240km away in Cyprus, led to the resignation of the Lebanese government.
nasa launched astronauts into space from American soil for the first time since the end of the shuttle programme in 2011. It used a SpaceX capsule, a first for a private company putting humans into orbit. China sent a spacecraft to the Moon to collect rocks, which hasn't been done since the 1970s.
""Parasite"", a South Korean comedy thriller, was the surprise winner at the Oscars. It beat the bookies' favourite, ""1917"", to scoop best picture, the first foreign-language film to do so.
Synchronicity
The film industry was hit hard by lockdowns, as cinema closures postponed the release of many blockbusters until 2021. Some went straight to streaming. Disney+, the studio's streaming service, ended the year with 87m subscribers. It wasn't expecting to reach that number until 2024; it now thinks it may have 260m users in four years' time. Disney reorganised its content delivery around streaming.

Even with huge government bail-outs, airlines are reckoned to have lost $51obn in revenue, according to their international association. The un reported that international tourism declined by 70% in JanuaryAugust, causing a loss of $730bn in export revenues.
Scientists had what many thought to be a Herculean task developing a vaccine for covid-19, but drug firms made great strides and by the end of the year several jabs were ready. Britain started the first inoculation programme using a fully tested vaccine, followed soon after by America. Even with the vaccine, officials warn, the world will be battling the virus for another year.
The outbreak of civil war in Ethiopia was one of 2020's great disappointments. Abiy Ahmed, the prime minister and winner of a Nobel peace prize, launched an attack on the Tigray region when separatist forces attacked the army.
Chinese and Indian troops clashed along their Himalayan border, the first deadly encounter between the two sides in decades. Fighting also erupted between Armenia and Azerbaijan over the longdisputed enclave of NagornoKarabakh. Their truce is shaky.
Abe Shinzo, Japan's longestserving prime minister, stood down from office because of ill health. He was replaced by Suga Yoshihide, who is determined that the Tokyo Olympics will go ahead in July 2021.
China imposed a draconian national-security law on Hong Kong to crush anti-government unrest. It came into force just before the 23rd anniversary of the city's handover to China from British rule. Elections to the Legislative Council were postponed; pro-democracy candidates had been expected to do well. Opposition legislators resigned en masse in protest against the disbarring of colleagues.
De do do do, de da da da
America's presidential election was a rowdy affair. The Democratic primaries produced a surprise when Pete Buttigieg was declared the winner in Iowa; a delay in the count because of a technical glitch raised more questions about America's election machinery. Joe Biden cleaned up on Super Tuesday, and went on to win the presidency. Donald Trump, who was acquitted at his impeachment trial in February, resorted to more shenanigans, falsely claiming the result was fraudulent. He will be gone from the White House on January 20th 2021.
The death of George Floyd, a black man, at the hands of police in Minneapolis sparked the worst unrest across America for decades. Floyd's cry that he couldn't breathe to the officer kneeling on his neck reverberated around the world. The incident led to a surge in global support for Black Lives Matter and a reckoning with the legacy of slavery and colonialism. Toppling statues of white men was de rigueur for woke activists in many cities. America endured a summer of protest; notable flashpoints included Kenosha and Portland.
So lonely
Britain officially left the European Union on January 31st, entering a transition period that ends on December 31st. Talks about a trade deal dragged on. Whatever the outcome, Britons were told to expect delays when visiting the continent from now on.
Venezuelan troops intercepted two small boatloads of men who wanted to overthrow the country's dictator, Nicolás Maduro. ""Operation Gideon"" was led by two former members of America's special forces. Six of the invaders, a group of deserters and Maduro opponents, were executed.
Western intelligence fingered the Kremlin for trying to assassinate Alexei Navalny, Russia's main opposition leader. Poisoned by novichok, a nerve agent, Mr Navalny fell ill on a plane and was airlifted to Germany for treatment. He eventually recovered and later called on the eu to impose sanctions on high-ranking Russian oligarchs.
King of pain
Belarus was thrown into crisis when Alexander Lukashenko won a sixth term as president in another rigged election. Widespread protests were brutally suppressed by state goons, forcing opposition leaders to flee the country.
Israel's third election in less than a year led to a powersharing agreement, with Binyamin Netanyahu remaining as prime minister until November 2021. Israel also signed peace deals, brokered by the Trump administration, with the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain, Morocco and Sudan. Other Arab countries may follow.
In other noteworthy elections, Sinn Fein got the most votes at the polls in Ireland but came second in terms of seats. The country got its first-ever coalition government between Fianna Fail and Fine Gael. In Bolivia's twice-postponed election Luis Arce won the presidency. He is from the left but is viewed as a technocrat.
There was talk of war in the Gulf region after America assassinated Qassem Suleimani, Iran's foremost general, in a drone strike at Baghdad's airport in January. Five days later a Ukrainian airliner crashed after taking off from Tehran airport, killing all 176 people on board. Iran's armed forces later admitted that they had mistaken the plane for a missile and shot it down.
Parts of central Beirut were destroyed by a huge explosion, killing 200 people and injuring 6,500. A fire at the port ignited 2,750 tonnes of ammonium nitrate that had been stored and neglected for seven years. The blast, felt 240km away in Cyprus, led to the resignation of the Lebanese government.
nasa launched astronauts into space from American soil for the first time since the end of the shuttle programme in 2011. It used a SpaceX capsule, a first for a private company putting humans into orbit. China sent a spacecraft to the Moon to collect rocks, which hasn't been done since the 1970s.
""Parasite"", a South Korean comedy thriller, was the surprise winner at the Oscars. It beat the bookies' favourite, ""1917"", to scoop best picture, the first foreign-language film to do so.
Synchronicity
The film industry was hit hard by lockdowns, as cinema closures postponed the release of many blockbusters until 2021. Some went straight to streaming. Disney+, the studio's streaming service, ended the year with 87m subscribers. It wasn't expecting to reach that number until 2024; it now thinks it may have 260m users in four years' time. Disney reorganised its content delivery around streaming.

S&Acaron;O GONÇALO
The hard-up received huge welfare payments during the pandemic. These may soon dry up
IN THE FINAL days of a tight mayoral race in November in Sāo Gonçalo, an unglamorous city across the bay from Rio de Janeiro, one of the candidates, a retired police officer known as Capitāo Nelson, made his way down a street lined with supporters. The mood was euphoric. A maskless man with a bottle of sanitiser on a string around his neck stomped his feet to funk music and squirted the gel into the air ""to kill the germs"" of the rival party. Humberto Perez, a handyman, likes the captain ""because he cares about poor people, just like the president"", Jair Bolsonaro. After work dried up in March a monthly payment from the federal government kept him from going hungry. ""And the campaign gave me a free lunch,"" he said, with a toothy grin.
The fact that some Brazilians are celebrating during a pandemic that has killed 180,000 of their fellow citizens is among covid-19's many paradoxes. So is the reason for their cheer: that a right-wing, pro-market government has rolled out the biggest welfare programme in Brazil's history. Before the pandemic, extreme poverty was on the rise. Nearly 1m families were on the waiting list for Bolsa Família, a conditional cash-transfer programme that the government had cut back after a recession in 2014-16. In March 2020 widespread hunger seemed imminent. Paulo Guedes, the economy minister, proposed to spend no more than 5bn reais ($1bn), 0.2% of the budget, to fight the pandemic.
But momentum began to build in Brazil's Congress to provide a basic income to poor people. Realising that it risked looking miserly, the government announced that it would give monthly payments of 600 reais to 68m Brazilians, a third of the population. Single mothers got twice that. In September the government halved the benefit, called auxilio emergencial (emergency aid), but extended it until the end of 2020. Brazil's fiscal response to the pandemic, which also includes job-retention schemes, adds up to more than 8% of gdp, among the highest for G20 countries and twice the average for emerging markets. Congress declared a ""state of calamity"" to allow the government to bypass a constitutional ceiling on spending.
But with public debt approaching 100% of gdp, the government now faces a moment of truth. The state of calamity ends on December 31st, and with it the auxilio. Brazil can do one of three things: chop welfare spending to pre-pandemic levels, breach the ceiling or enact fiscal reforms that would allow it to maintain both. The third choice is the best, but it is also the most difficult. Since a landmark pension reform in 2019, the government has done little to cut spending or improve its effectiveness.
The auxilio has been a remarkable success. For more than 7m informal workers who lost their jobs, it was a crucial safetynet. It tripled payments to 14m families who had received an average of 190 reais a month from Bolsa Família. The auxilio lifted 1m people out of extreme poverty (see chart on next page) and kept another 15m from becoming poor. Fundaçao Getulio Vargas (fgv), a university, found that Brazil's Gini coefficient, a measure of inequality, swiftly dropped from 0.55 to 0.49, which is a lot. Poverty and inequality are the lowest since fgv began tracking them in 1970.
Brazilians whose pockets were empty after years of low growth bought televisions and ovens. Millions opened their first bank accounts. The poor north-east experienced a construction boom. After a 9.7% contraction in the second quarter, the 1 economy grew 7.7% in the third. It will shrink in 2020 by half as much as many economists had predicted.
Mr Bolsonaro's approval ratings climbed, smoothing the way for an alliance with the centrāo (big centre), a bloc of opportunistic centre-right parties in Congress. ""The expectation of victory and power brings us together,"" says Ricardo Barros, now the government's whip. Centrāo candidates were the biggest winners in the local elections. They included Capitāo Nelson, who won an upset victory against his left-wing rival. He promised money for new clinics and more police.
That will be a hard promise to keep. The stimulus was a ""huge dose of anaesthesia that numbed the pain of the pandemic"", says Marcelo Neri of fgv. On January 1st ""it will wear off"". The unemployment rate of 14.6% is the highest it has ever been. People in the poorest half of households have lost 28% of their earnings. ""Unwinding all the extraordinary support in the coming months could risk derailing the incipient recovery,"" warns the imf. Millions could fall into poverty.
If Brazil tapers spending gradually, as other countries plan to do, it will breach the ceiling, which was enacted in 2016 to control rising debt. It limits growth in most federal expenditure to the previous year's rate of inflation. Because 94% of the budget is eaten up by mandatory spending (chiefly pensions and salaries), little is left for investment and social programmes. In 2019 the government spent 3obn reais, or 0.4% of gdp, on Bolsa Família. The auxilio cost ten times that.
Some Brazilians think the ceiling is essential to prevent an eventual default. But Brazil's debt is largely denominated in its own currency, which reduces that risk. If interest rates were to rise uncontrollably, the Central Bank could buy government debt. The cap matters more as a sign of commitment to reforms, says Arthur Carvalho of Truxt Investimentos, a hedge fund. ""If you can't cut anything in a mammoth state to fund an important social programme, you can't make choices,"" he says. The imf urges Brazil to keep the ceiling and make space for a more targeted benefit in 2021 by ""swiftly"" passing money-saving reforms. Brazil risks hyperinflation if it scraps the spending ceiling, warned Mr Guedes in an interview with The Economist.
Neither big reforms nor a change in the spending cap is in prospect, which means welfare spending is set to fall. The damage to the poor will be modest, Mr Guedes thinks. The beneficiaries of the auxilio ""were alive before the pandemic"", he said. ""They had informal jobs"" cleaning houses or selling sweets on the beach. ""If the economy recovers they'll be back."" Mr Guedes is bullish about that. ""We will end this year with zero net jobs lost in the formal labour market,"" he predicts. ""I challenge any country to beat our record.""
His boss is less relaxed. Mr Bolsonaro wants to launch a new programme, Renda Cidadā (Citizens' Income), which would help more families than Bolsa Família, although fewer than the auxilio. But he has rejected proposals for how to pay for it. ""I can't take away from the poor to give to the poorer,"" he said when Mr Guedes suggested trimming other programmes.
There are other ideas. Congress is considering an ""emergency"" constitutional reform that would curb public-sector pay and tax exemptions. This would free a bit of cash for welfare. More would be available if that reform were coupled with an amendment to make the spending limit more flexible during crises, suggests Monica de Bolle of the Peterson Institute for International Economics, a think-tank in Washington. ""You could do this without spooking markets,"" she says. But Congress signalled last week that it will discuss the emergency measures only in February at the earliest. Mr Guedes promptly said he would take a holiday.
The government and Congress could put off a reckoning by extending the state of calamity, using a second wave of covid-19 as its justification. Mr Guedes has hinted he might endorse that. It would merely postpone the choice between fiscal reform and welfare cuts. The auxilio ""can't last for ever"", says Carlos Jordy, a congressional ally of Mr Bolsonaro who attended Capitāo Nelson's rally. Mr Perez, the handyman, may learn painfully that there is no such thing as a free lunch.","Brazil

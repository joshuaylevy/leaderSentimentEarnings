AUSTRIA'S predilection for grand coalitions, which have governed the country for much of the post-war era, may be ending. This week its current left-right alliance broke up acrimoniously after only 18 months in office. Complaining of disarray among the Social Democrats and of the government's sharp U-turn over the European Union, the People's Party demanded a snap election, which will take place on September 28th. It will be closely watched to the north, in Germany, where another grand coalition is bickering and the Social Democrats are also in disarray.
The Austrian government's collapse owes much to the failings of Alfred Gusenbauer, the Social Democrats' leader. He unexpectedly became chancellor after narrowly defeating his People's Party rival, Wolfgang Schussel, in 2006, but he lacked the leadership and charisma to manage an unruly grand coalition. As the People's Party took most of the senior cabinet posts and fended off serious policy changes, Mr Gusenbauer also lost the confidence of his own party. When the Social Democrats did badly in regional elections, he was forced to hand the leadership to Werner Faymann, the transport minister, last month.
Mr Faymann's first move was to shift his party's position on Europe by calling for referendums on any future EU treaty, despite the fact that Mr Gusenbauer had just refused to put the Lisbon treaty to a popular vote. The shift was announced in an open letter to Kronen Zeitung, an anti-European tabloid. Mr Faymann also walked away from a coalition deal on reining in spending on pensions. It was too much for the People's Party leader (and finance minister), Wilhelm Molterer.
In provoking an early election, Mr Molterer is gambling that voters will prefer his promise of responsible government to the populist message of the Social Democrats. The outcome is uncertain. Austrians rival the British in their Euroscepticism, and most are also against cuts in social spending. The real risk is that neither party can match the demagoguery of the far right.
Heinz-Christian Strache is hoping to push his Freedom Party back to the highs it enjoyed before his predecessor, Jorg Haider, joined a coalition government that suffered temporary ostracism by the rest of Europe. If the Freedom Party gets close to the 20% voting share predicted in most polls, the two big parties will face an unappealing choice: either join forces with an irresponsible rabble-rouser, risking a repeat of the country's 1990s isolation; or revert once again to a discredited grand coalition, with the built-in conflicts that make governing Austria so hard.","One grand coalition in a German - speaking country falls apart

AFTER a string of electoral defeats and internal divisions, the far right staged a spectacular comeback in the Austrian election on September 28th. Between them, the openly anti-immigration Freedom Party and its offshoot, the Alliance for Austria's Future, led by Jorg Haider, took 29% of the vote, within a whisker of the Social Democratic Party, which remained the biggest party even though its vote fell from 35% to just under 30%. Young voters (whose numbers had risen because the voting age was reduced to 16 before the election) seem to have been as keen on the far right as their older peers, if not more so.
Most analysts agree that voters did not actually move rightwards, but rather wanted to express discontent with the poor performance and squabbling of the outgoing ""grand coalition"" between the Social Democrats and the conservative People's Party. Alas, they will probably get a government of the same parties, albeit with different faces at the top.
Werner Faymann, who only recently took over the leadership of the Social Democrats from the unpopular chancellor, Alfred Gusenbauer, is adamant that he will not form a coalition with either Mr Haider (whose party took 11% of the vote) or his former protege turned bitter rival, Heinz-Christian Strache of the Freedom Party (which got 18%). In the campaign he said he would happily link up with the People's Party again, so long as it got rid of its leaders, the party's chairman, Wilhelm Molterer, and its veteran parliamentary faction leader (and former chancellor), Wolfgang Schussel. 
As it happens, the party dumped Mr Molterer when the results came in, for good reason. He had forced a snap election and then run such a poor campaign that the People's Party's share of the vote tumbled from 34% to 26%, a record low. His designated successor is the environment minister, Josef Proll, widely known to be Mr Faymann's favourite conservative.
Mr Faymann and Mr Proll may wish to show that the alliance between the country's two big parties, which has ruled Austria for most of the post-war era, can work even with a small majority. Perhaps it can. The failings of the outgoing government arose mainly from Mr Schussel's refusal to accept his narrow defeat in the 2006 election and his use of Mr Molterer to make life miserable for the Social Democrats.
A continuation of the grand coalition may or may not be good for Austria, but it seems certain to be good for the far right. Mr Strache and Mr Haider, shut out of power, would continue to lambast the ""coalition of losers"" for carrying on with business as usual. They may also gain from Austrians' rising Euroscepticism (according to the latest Eurobarometer poll, only 36% think that their country's EU membership, which has been a boon to the economy, is a good thing). Even if a grand coalition holds together, it might be pushed by a vocal opposition into populist policies such as tighter immigration control.
Some Social Democrats have argued for a minority government instead, but neither Mr Faymann nor the federal president, Heinz Fischer, is thought to favour such an experiment. A different way out would be to move away from proportional representation. The two main parties discussed this inconclusively when they had the two-thirds majority needed for constitutional change. With that majority gone, Austria may be stuck with a system that perpetuates unhappy grand coalitions--and feeds far-right parties.","The far right does well , but the government is likely to exclude it

IN THE end, Tony Blair's great European adventure seems to have been a balancing act too far. As prime minister, Mr Blair built a career on political acrobatics. He was the Labour politician who left in place great chunks of Thatcherism. As prime minister, he swore he was a true European (the ""most European of Englishmen"", France's Nicolas Sarkozy once said) even as he defended opt-outs from such policies as ending internal European Union passport controls. More than any British leader, he backed closer European defence co-operation--and then he split Europe by joining America in Iraq.
But high-wire acts hurt when they fail. And, at an EU summit in Brussels on October 29th and 30th, Mr Blair fell, watching his bid to become the first permanent president of the European Council collapse. Mr Blair needed leaders to agree that he was a sincere European, and they could not. He needed his fellow socialists to admit he was one of them, and they declined (the centre-left Austrian chancellor, Werner Faymann, said Mr Blair represented ""Bush and the war in Iraq"".)
The post at issue is not ""president of Europe"" but a narrower job, created by the Lisbon treaty, to chair meetings of the union's 27 national leaders, and speak for them abroad, for up to five years. It replaces a rotating system under which countries set the agenda for, and chaired, EU summits for six months.
EU jobs were not on the agenda of this summit. Mr Blair was not even in Brussels. But he dominated the corridor talk. Officially, EU leaders were waiting for final treaty ratification, which came a few days later on November 3rd, after the Czech president, Vaclav Klaus, ended a one-man campaign to resist Lisbon and signed it, paving the way for another summit to discuss top jobs. Yet even before Mr Klaus climbed down, leaders had found proxy means of debating Mr Blair.
At the October summit, socialists from Spain, Portugal, Austria and the European Parliament said their block should get the other big job created by Lisbon, that of high representative for foreign policy. Because the left controls a minority of EU governments and cannot claim both top jobs, that was code for ditching Mr Blair. Meeting socialist colleagues before the summit, Gordon Brown, the British prime minister, testily urged them to ""get real"" and back Mr Blair. His browbeating failed. Euro-socialists say their top candidates for high representative are David Miliband, the British foreign secretary (who may prefer to stay in national politics), and Italy's Massimo D'Alema, a wily ex-communist who was quite a successful foreign minister.
On the right, Mr Sarkozy declined to repeat his endorsement of Mr Blair. Sphinx-like, he would say only that EU jobs rarely went to early front-runners. In late-night briefings, the French murmured that Britain's EU opt-outs were ""not an advantage"" for Mr Blair. In truth, Mr Sarkozy's chief concern is to stick close to the German chancellor, Angela Merkel. He announced proudly that France and Germany would jointly support candidates for the top jobs. Ms Merkel, a Christian Democrat, is more tribal than Mr Sarkozy. She reportedly feels the centre-right should provide the first council president, as it controls most national governments. The president should also come from a ""small country"", she briefed German reporters, at least this time. 
That will have big consequences for the EU and its image. Whatever people think of Mr Blair, making him president would have signalled that the EU wanted a spokesman with direct access to world leaders. Mr Blair's apparent demise as a candidate (British officials loyally insist he still has a chance, once EU leaders ponder the unpalatable alternatives) signals the opposite. So does the rise of such alternative frontrunners as the Dutch or Luxembourgeois prime ministers, or the current darling of the corridors, Herman Van Rompuy, a clever, Haiku-writing ascetic who is prime minister of Belgium. Mr Van Rompuy, a Christian Democrat, is an Atlanticist and (a bit) less of a Euro-fanatic than previous Belgian prime ministers. He is endearingly modest: indulging in his first foreign caravan holiday this summer, he declared that at his age ""you are allowed to go a bit mad"". But as prime minister, his main experience of international disputes is a Belgo-Dutch spat over the dredging of the River Scheldt. Turning inwards, not outwards
When speaking jointly as the European Council, it turns out, EU leaders do not want to talk to the world. They want to talk to themselves. Pointing out that the new high representative will have lots of money and staff, as people in Brussels do, cannot hide this essential lack of ambition: he or she will be a peer of the world's foreign ministers, not of its leaders.
The Blair saga also casts alarming light on Britain's Conservative Party. Their foreign affairs chief, William Hague, told EU ambassadors in London that making Mr Blair president would be a ""hostile"" act. David Cameron, the Tory leader, called for a modest ""chairmanic"" head of the European Council. The Tories offered two arguments: that voters were denied a referendum on Lisbon so Mr Blair had no right to the job, and that Mr Blair would make the post too big a deal.
Britain was, indeed, denied a Lisbon referendum. But it is hard to see how Tory interests are advanced by helping a Belgian federalist into a top EU job. An even bigger Tory mistake is the belief that a modest president will mean a modest Europe. It will not. It means, rather, that the bit of the EU machine that directly represents national governments will have a weaker voice, to the advantage of the more federalist institutions: the European Commission and the European Parliament.

EUROPE is turning on its tax dodgers. Next month a European Union summit will discuss how to recover some of the EUR 1 trillion ($1.3 trillion) in revenues lost yearly through tax evasion and avoidance. President Francois Hollande wants to eradicate tax havens. Nine countries have plans to share more tax information automatically. Even Luxembourg is giving up bank secrecy. In these days of austerity, there is no love lost for those who evade taxes. Perhaps the surprise is that action has taken so long. 
Eye-catching revelations are one reason things are moving. In Britain it was the derisory corporate tax paid by Starbucks and other multinationals. In France it was the disgrace of the former budget minister, Jerome Cahuzac, who stashed money in a secret Swiss bank account. In Germany tax authorities have been buying black-market data on accounts in Liechtenstein and Switzerland. The sheer scale of recent offshore leaks, with revelations of 120,000 companies and trusts in havens like the British Virgin Islands, demanded action. The EU bail-out that crushed two banks in Cyprus, stuffed with Russian money, is another warning that offshore havens are no longer safe. 
The most important force for change is the least visible: America's readiness to wield blunt financial power beyond its borders. Under the Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act, financial institutions must reveal details of American clients abroad or face a 30% withholding tax on any income earned in America. EU members are negotiating to provide the information, reducing the administrative burden and allowing a reciprocal deal for America to pass on information about European citizens. 
Most EU governments (except Luxembourg and Austria) already swap information on bank interest earned by foreign EU nationals, under the EU's savings directive. From next year a separate law will extend this practice to other forms of revenue--including employment earnings, directors' fees, pensions, life insurance and rents. It also stipulates that, if an EU member agrees to wider co-operation with a third country, the same provisions must apply to its fellows: so if EU countries swap information with America they must also give it to others within the EU. 
Luxembourg has bowed to the inevitable, and declared that it will apply the savings directive from 2015. German politicians' poor jokes about invading Luxembourg as ""in the old times"" may have offended the Grand Duchy, but it was the threat of being cut off from the American financial system that forced it to embrace ""white"" money. ""We can only thank America,"" says Sven Giegold, a German Green MEP. But Austria, with a constitutionally enshrined right to bank secrecy, is holding out. Maria Fekter, its finance minister, calls herself a ""hunter of tax cheats but also protector of honest savers"". The chancellor, Werner Faymann, seems readier to change. In Brussels the reckoning is that Austria's resistance will not last much beyond September's election. 
Once these EU diehards are defeated, Eurocrats hope to conclude a broader version of the savings directive. And they want a strong mandate to negotiate automatic data-exchange with Switzerland, Liechtenstein and other non-EU tax havens. For the moment these shelters apply a withholding tax on EU citizens' accounts and remit the money to governments anonymously; they also provide information ""on request"" if fraud is suspected. 
The gradual death of bank secrecy in Europe will do little to confront legal tax schemes that allow big multinational firms to ""pay only as much tax as they choose"", as one EU diplomat puts it. Part of the problem involves offshore havens offering secrecy, light regulation and low (or no) taxation. But part is onshore. The EU may have a single market that allows free movement of capital and goods, but it has 27 national tax jurisdictions. Whether through deliberate competition or inadvertent mismatches in tax rules, efforts to avoid double taxation often result in no taxation. Some of the best-known schemes are named after EU members: the ""double Irish"" and the ""Dutch sandwich"". London tolerates many dodgy shell companies and limited-liability partnerships. 
How sovereign? 
Tax policy is, for the most part, a jealously guarded national competence in the EU. The authority to tax citizens is seen as a central attribute of sovereignty. Critics say a refusal to pool powers at EU level risks creating a ""race to the bottom"", with each country trying to outdo its neighbour. Yet if so, the danger in harmonisation must be of more oppressive taxation. Smaller, poorer countries on Europe's periphery have every right to levy low rates of tax. Britain should not have to sign up to a financial-transactions tax it dislikes. If France insists on taxing its rich citizens at a rate of 75%, it can blame only itself when they leave. 
Yet co-operation in an age of mobile capital is necessary to ensure that international companies pay their taxes. A tougher policy of naming and shaming tax havens is a start. More transparency on where companies earn money, employ staff and pay tax is desirable. Renegotiating double-taxation agreements could close some loopholes. But all this is best done globally. Agreement within the EU would help, but is held back by a mutual suspicion. At one end stand European institutions seeking to build their empires. At the other stands Britain, with its innate aversion to any arrangement that has a European label. 
Countries need to find a middle way. Not all tax competition is ""harmful"", even if in some forms it may be. Elaborate tax schemes can give big multinationals an unfair advantage over smaller domestic firms. Joint action should not be an excuse to force up Ireland's 12.5% rate of corporate tax. But inaction that allows firms to engineer a rate more like 2.5% for themselves is inexcusable. In such a world, sovereignty comes at a cost that too often goes unrecognised.","Bank secrecy is dying in Europe--thanks mainly to America

Yet if so, the danger in harmonisation must be of more oppressive taxation. Smaller, poorer countries on Europe's periphery have every right to levy low rates of tax. Britain should not have to sign up to a financial-transactions tax it dislikes. If France insists on taxing its rich citizens at a rate of 75%, it can blame only itself when they leave. 
Yet co-operation in an age of mobile capital is necessary to ensure that international companies pay their taxes. A tougher policy of naming and shaming tax havens is a start. More transparency on where companies earn money, employ staff and pay tax is desirable. Renegotiating double-taxation agreements could close some loopholes. But all this is best done globally. Agreement within the EU would help, but is held back by a mutual suspicion. At one end stand European institutions seeking to build their empires. At the other stands Britain, with its innate aversion to any arrangement that has a European label. 
Countries need to find a middle way. Not all tax competition is ""harmful"", even if in some forms it may be. Elaborate tax schemes can give big multinationals an unfair advantage over smaller domestic firms. Joint action should not be an excuse to force up Ireland's 12.5% rate of corporate tax. But inaction that allows firms to engineer a rate more like 2.5% for themselves is inexcusable. In such a world, sovereignty comes at a cost that too often goes unrecognised.",305,Austria,A30-66,,False,,0,True

AT FIRST sight, Austrian voters chose business as usual in the election on September 29th. The Social Democrats (SPO) and centre-right People's Party (OVP), which have governed the country together for all but seven years since 1986, retained their majority, albeit with fewer seats. Even though a coalition between the OVP and two right-wing groups is theoretically possible, another left-right coalition seems more likely. 
Yet a closer look at the result reveals signs of turmoil in Austrian politics. Due to a larger-than-ever protest vote, the two main parties saw their combined share of the vote fall to just over 50%, down from 55% in 2006 and 78% in 2002. A whopping 30% went to the Eurosceptic far right, split between the xenophobic Freedom Party (FPO) with 21%, the more centrist Alliance for Austria's Future, which fell just short of the 4% threshold to enter parliament, and Team Stronach, led by Frank Stronach, an Austro-Canadian entrepreneur, which got nearly 6%. 
Although Austria boasts the lowest unemployment in the European Union and has weathered the financial crisis since 2008 better than most, there is a groundswell of anger and frustration among voters, says Peter Filzmaier, a political scientist at the Donau-Universitat Krems. Supporters of these parties ""see themselves as the economic losers"", he says. Blue-collar workers deserted the SPO for the FPO. Fear of immigration and anger about bank bail-outs and euro-zone bail-outs swelled the protest vote. 
Young, urban voters mostly supported the Greens, which received 12%, and Neos, a new centrist party that gained a surprisingly strong 5%. The only groups that strongly supported the coalition parties were the elderly and, in the case of the OVP, farmers. 
With 27% of the vote, the SPO remains the largest faction ahead of the OVP, which got 24%. Werner Faymann, the chancellor and SPO leader, wants to form the next government with the OVP, which has started a desperate search for alternatives. The OVP has a traditionally strong pro-European outlook and would find it hard to co-operate with the Eurosceptic fringe as it did between 2000 and 2006. The FPO has become even more extreme and Team Stronach seems unfit to govern due to the erratic octogenarian Mr Stronach. 
By resisting calls for a new ""grand coalition"", OVP grandees are probably just trying to drive up the price for a new pact. Coalition talks could drag on for weeks or even months. And once the partners get back together, the marriage is unlikely to be much happier than before.","Austrians flocked to populist parties

""WE WILL manage,"" said Angela Merkel, the German chancellor, in an attempt earlier this month to win public support for the refugees streaming into the country from the Middle East via the Balkans. Her phrase was both optimistic and familiar--it comes from the German version of the theme song of ""Bob the Builder"", a children's television series. 
But within two weeks, on September 13th, Mrs Merkel performed a volte-face that stunned the European Union. Because Germany could not ""manage"" the influx of asylum-seekers and migrants, she reimposed controls along the border with Austria, accelerating an already galloping crisis. Austria, Slovakia and the Netherlands followed suit with controls of their own. They are said to be temporary and legal under the Schengen agreement that sets up free travel in most of the EU. And so they may be. But the crisis has a life of its own. 
Hungary declared an emergency, sealed its border with Serbia with barbed-wire fences and began arresting those trying to cross. Police fired tear gas at them; 20 officers and many refugees were hurt. Growing numbers of refugees are now trapped on the Serbian side and have started evading the barrier by marching into Romania and Croatia, which are in the EU but not yet in Schengen. Hungary responded by saying it will extend the fence to its Romanian border. The cascade of events is likely to continue. 
Mrs Merkel and her Austrian counterpart, Werner Faymann, meeting in Berlin on September 15th, called for an emergency EU summit. A day earlier the EU's interior ministers had failed to reach agreement on a plan proposed by the European Commission for a binding quota system that would allocate 120,000 refugees among member states. The fiercest resistance came from eastern European countries. The plan could still be passed when the ministers next meet on September 22nd. But Germany's interior minister, Thomas de Maiziere, says that more pressure is needed. He proposes cutting EU subsidies to member states that refuse to take their share of refugees. 
Disorder on the border 
A potentially more effective way of exerting pressure involves extending German border controls to its eastern neighbours, Poland and the Czech Republic. The checks would not affect the legal rights of people seeking asylum in Germany (there or anywhere else) but merely move the burden of registering applicants from inland processing centres to the border. Yet controls would slow traffic and disrupt commerce, much of which benefits eastern Europe. Germany, ever sensitive about being seen as a bully, will think hard about increasing pressure overtly. Nonetheless, on September 7th Sigmar Gabriel, Germany's vice-chancellor and economics minister, made a veiled threat. More border controls, he said, ""would be a politically dramatic reverse for Europe, and I think a mental one too. But it would also be a heavy economic blow...especially for those states that are now saying: 'We won't participate.'"" 
For now, Mrs Merkel is busy shoring up domestic support. She became a heroine of sorts to refugees and many citizens on September 4th when she allowed trains to carry stranded refugees from Hungary through Austria into Germany. Germans bearing flowers and sweets turned out to welcome them. But Mrs Merkel, who is usually more cautious, had acted without bringing along some of her closest political partners. The conservative Christian Social Union governs the state of Bavaria, which borders Austria, and was outraged by Mrs Merkel's welcoming stance, calling it a ""grave mistake"". Other regional and municipal governments joined in the criticism. So did some EU countries, accusing Mrs Merkel of encouraging even more refugees to come. 
Germany's welcome mat could fray as the crisis grows. But Mrs Merkel is trying to retain her position as a champion of refugees. ""If we now have to start apologising for showing a friendly face in an emergency, then this is not my country,"" she said defiantly on September 15th. 
She is haunted by the spectre that EU countries could fail in their greatest humanitarian challenge yet, thus betraying their own values. Border controls appear to negate perhaps the most visible achievement of European integration. Unsurprisingly many Eurosceptics are celebrating. ""Schengen surely can't survive now,"" tweeted Nigel Farage, the leader of Britain's UK Independence Party.

ON MARCH 17th, as The Economist went to press, Angela Merkel was on her way to Brussels for a summit that may define her legacy as German chancellor. At her initiative, the 28 member states of the European Union were to agree to a controversial deal with Turkey that Mrs Merkel had earlier this month sold as a potential ""breakthrough"" in the refugee crisis. But many of her EU counterparts demurred. Even if a compromise materialises, Mrs Merkel currently looks more isolated than any German chancellor since the 1950s. 
This continues a slide in Mrs Merkel's power. Only last summer, she was first among equals in the EU, having managed the euro crisis and a showdown with Russia in Ukraine. But on September 4th she opened Germany's borders to refugees streaming into Europe, setting off conflicts with Hungary and other eastern countries. At first she had Austria on her side. But in January its chancellor, Werner Faymann, turned into an opponent, as he led a group of Balkan countries to close their borders. 
Mrs Merkel's isolation has not gone unnoticed in Germany. Horst Seehofer, the premier of Bavaria and leader of the Christian Social Union (CSU), nominally the sister party of Mrs Merkel's Christian Democratic Union (CDU), has been attacking her for months. He demands a fixed upper limit on refugees, as Austria has imposed. Following regional elections on March 13th in which the Christian Democrats fared badly, Mr Seehofer warned of an ""existential"" threat to the Union parties. 
His worry is that Union supporters keep drifting to the Alternative for Germany (AfD), a right-wing party founded in 2013. On March 13th it came second behind the CDU in Saxony-Anhalt, with 24%. Compared with other countries with populist parties, however, that is not unusual. ""I do not see the AfD as an existential problem for the CDU, but I do see it as a problem,"" Mrs Merkel said. Defiantly, she then redoubled her commitment to a ""European"" solution to the crisis, rather than ""national"" one, involving border closures. 
The lessons of the elections are indeed ambiguous, for they show Mrs Merkel to be less vulnerable than it appears to observers abroad. The winners in the two western states, Baden-Wurttemberg and Rhineland-Palatinate, were the Greens and the Social Democrats, respectively. Their candidates supported Mrs Merkel's stance on refugees and were rewarded for it. The Christian Democrats failed mainly because their candidates had tried to distance themselves from her line. ""The majority of voters supported Merkel's refugee policy,"" says Gero Neugebauer, a political scientist at Free University Berlin. 
Moreover there exists no plausible scenario in which Mrs Merkel could be toppled. The opposition parties in the federal parliament have only 20% of seats and, in any event, agree with Mrs Merkel on refugees. The Social Democrats, her coalition partners, are cantankerous but also side with her. Moreover, they know that ousting Mrs Merkel would lead to new elections, which they do not want. They would lose seats (in two of the three elections on March 13th they received a drubbing). And the AfD would almost certainly enter the federal parliament, a situation which they want to avoid. 
Even the CSU cannot directly unseat Mrs Merkel. If its 56 members of parliament were to walk out of the coalition, Mrs Merkel's majority would merely shrink from 80% to 71%. That leaves only her own party, the CDU, as the place where a putsch could originate. But while she does have naysayers there, it is famous for rallying loyally around its leaders. 
More importantly, no viable contender exists to take Mrs Merkel's place. Wolfgang Schauble, currently the finance minister, is said to hold a grudge since Mrs Merkel outmanoeuvred him to become party leader in 2000. But he is 73. Ursula von der Leyen, the defence minister, has less support within the CDU than Mrs Merkel and is at least as liberal as Mrs Merkel concerning refugees. Julia Klockner, the Christian Democrat candidate in Rhineland-Palatinate, was once mentioned as a potential heiress to Mrs Merkel. But she lost the election there, her second defeat in five years. 
The only way for Mrs Merkel to leave office before her term is up in 2017 would be if she chooses to. Rumours do indeed recur that she may be open to the job of secretary-general of the United Nations. But that would be out of character at this stage of her career.

A four-star general in North Korea who was thought to have been executed earlier this year has apparently resurfaced.

Werner Faymann stepped down as the chancellor of Austria. He had been in power since 2008, but faced criticism from within his party, the Social Democrats, for the country's increasingly hard line on refugees. The far-right Freedom Party is ahead in the polls in the run-off for the federal presidency, a mostly ceremonial role. 
Ahead of new elections in Spain on June 26th, Podemos, a far-left movement, announced that it would form a parliamentary pact with United Left, the former communist party. ""We want to agree on a government for progressive change,"" said Pablo Iglesias, the leader of Podemos. 
After weeks of protests against France's controversial new labour laws, Francois Hollande, the president, forced through the reforms without a parliamentary vote. 
The Italian parliament voted in favour of civil unions for gay couples. Italy was the last big Western democracy not to have any legal recognition of same-sex partnerships. 
Sadiq Khan, a British-born Muslim of Pakistani descent, won London's mayoral election with over 50% of the vote. The battle between the Labour man and his Conservative rival was marred by a pernicious attempt to link Mr Khan to Islamic extremism. Donald Trump, the presumptive Republican presidential candidate, said he would make an ""exception"" for the mayor to his proposed ban on Muslims entering America. Mr Khan dismissed the offer. 
In other elections in Britain, the Conservatives surged to replace Labour as the second party in Scotland behind the nationalist SNP, which lost its majority rule. In Wales the right-wing anti-Europe UK Independence Party claimed seven seats, their first ever in the Welsh Assembly. In England Labour avoided the drubbing that was expected in council elections.

FOR seven and a half years, Austria's chancellor, Werner Faymann, survived the fall-out of the world financial crisis, turmoil in the euro zone, a wave of refugees and more than a dozen electoral setbacks for his Social Democratic party. As of last week, he was the European Union's second-longest-serving head of government, after Germany's Angela Merkel. 
But the first round of Austria's presidential elections last month, where his party's candidate won a dismal 11% of the vote, was one defeat too many. At the traditional May Day parade, party stalwarts turned away and young activists booed him. On May 9th Mr Faymann stepped down. A politician better at infighting than public speaking, he leaves behind a divided party and a precarious government. 
The coalition, with the centre-right People's Party as junior partners, enjoys a slim majority in parliament. But it is under attack from the far-right Freedom Party, which is well ahead in the opinion polls. Norbert Hofer, its soft-spoken candidate for the federal presidency, got 35% in the first round and is the favourite to win the run-off on May 22nd. The position is mostly ceremonial, but can exercise real power in uncertain times. Mr Hofer has threatened to try to block EU trade agreements, and to dismiss parliament if it raises taxes or relaxes immigration barriers. 
The Freedom Party has been riding a wave of discontent with both governing parties, which have been ruling jointly or in alternation since 1945. It got its biggest boost last year, when about 1m migrants from the Middle East came through the country. Though most moved on to Germany and Sweden, 90,000 people applied for asylum in Austria last year, a large number for a nation of 8m citizens. 
Mr Faymann at first stood by Mrs Merkel in her determination to keep the doors open for refugees. But under pressure from public opinion and his coalition partner, he agreed in January to erect border controls and cap the number of asylum-seekers allowed in, triggering a wave of border closures through the Balkans. The volte-face split the party: left-wingers accused Mr Faymann of kissing up to the Freedom Party, while centrists said the party should start to cooperate with the far right. 
This rift puts Mr Faymann's successor in a tricky position. The most likely candidate is Christian Kern, the boss of the state-owned railway company, who has strong roots in the party but no experience of day-to-day politics. He will be more willing to undertake business-friendly economic reforms than Mr Faymann was, says Thomas Hofer, a political analyst, ""but it will be a hard sell within the party."" 
The refugee policy, however, is unlikely to change. The People's Party says it will remain in the coalition only if the borders remain shut for most asylum-seekers. Reinhold Mitterlehner, the party leader, is under pressure because of poor polls and must compete for popularity with Sebastian Kurz, the foreign minister, a charismatic 29-year-old who takes hard-line positions on immigration. Both parties will want to avoid snap elections before their term ends in 2018. 
A victory for the far-right presidential candidate may, paradoxically, boost the fortunes of the coalition, says Mr Hofer. It would bring its parties closer together, fearing a far-right power grab. Neither Social Democrats nor conservatives will want to play junior partner to a populist Freedom Party and its rabble-rousing leader, Heinz-Christian Strache. Thanks to a lack of good alternatives, the old coalition could live on, warts and all.

WHAT is Austria's problem? In Vienna the streets are clean, the trams rattle reliably past and the bow-tied waiters still dispense their Sachertorte with supercilious smirks. The country is well-run, prosperous and secure. There are no neglected banlieues. Even the refugees who poured through last year have stopped coming. And yet Austria is on the verge of electing a far-right president from a party with an unsavoury past. 
Last month, for the first time in post-war Austria, voters in the first round of a presidential election spurned the candidates backed by the centre-left Social Democrats (SPO) and centre-right People's Party (OVP), which run the country in a ""grand coalition"". In Sunday's run-off they must choose between Norbert Hofer, the fresh-faced candidate of the far-right Freedom Party (FPO), or Alexander Van der Bellen, an aged professor backed by the Greens. Mr Hofer is the favourite, and the rest of Europe is alarmed. 
The FPO operates from a familiar populist-right playbook. The suits have grown sharper while the outright racism has been cloaked. The hostility has shifted from Jews to Muslims, a strategy that resonates with voters of Serbian background, whom the party has assiduously cultivated. Its leaders prefer social media to the traditional kind. Its base is poorly educated rural men. It has no good words for America but plenty for Vladimir Putin. 
If he wins, Mr Hofer is unlikely to wreak constitutional havoc. But should Heinz-Christian Strache, the FPO's chairman, become chancellor at the next federal election (due in September 2018, if not sooner), some fear a Hungarian-style attack on independent institutions. Others worry about squabbles with neighbours; Mr Strache has mused that the German-speakers of South Tyrol, across the Italian border, might like to rejoin their Austrian brethren. What do voters see in this outfit? 
For decades Austria was a living example of the old saw that there is no point in voting because the government always gets in. The Second Republic, established after the war, has been run almost without interruption by either, or (usually) both, the SPO and the OVP. Under Austria's Proporz system, jobs, housing and business licences were doled out on the basis of party membership. Laws are written by party-affiliated labour or business groups and handed to parliament to rubber-stamp. Even now two motoring associations and two mountain-trekking clubs exist, to ensure that Austrians need never dally with another political tribe when their cars break down or when on an Alpine stroll. 
This arrangement worked when growth was high and jobs plentiful. But when the system faltered, cronyism made an easy target for genuine opposition parties. Austria, which never went through a thorough German-style post-Nazi reckoning, was not inoculated against a xenophobic party like the FPO. The party chugged along for years as a political also-ran, until hostility to the clubbiness of Austrian politics lifted it into the major league. 
The FPO became a serious force in the late 1980s under a charismatic leader, Jorg Haider, who was not averse to praising Nazi Germany. In 1999 it won 27% of the vote and joined an OVP-led coalition. (Austria's horrified EU partners briefly cut diplomatic links.) But after a flurry of early reforms the government turned out to be no less wedded to the methods of patronage than its predecessors. The extent of the corruption the FPO practised while in office is only now emerging. 
The party split, and for a while sank. Mr Haider died in a car crash in 2008. But last year's refugee crisis revived it. Austria's hapless social-democrat chancellor, Werner Faymann, initially supported Germany's open-door policy before pirouetting gracelessly towards border closures and asylum quotas, as the FPO had advocated from the start. The grand coalition fed the discontent with aimless rows. The FPO has now topped polls for over a year. On May 9th, under pressure from his disgruntled party, Mr Faymann abruptly resigned. 
After being sworn in this week his successor, Christian Kern, admitted that the grand coalition was losing voters' trust. His speech also revealed the constraints on the government. Mr Kern backed Mr Van der Bellen for president but was unable to offer the SVO's formal support, because many of its members hope to join the FPO in coalition. The OVP feels the same. The government now has its last chance to show that it has not run out of ideas. There is plenty to do, from schools reform to slashing red tape to constitutional changes. Some 90,000 asylum-seekers need integrating. ""The OVP, and in particular the SPO, thought reforms would lose them elections,"" says Franz Schellhorn, director of Agenda Austria, a think-tank. ""Now the opposite is true."" 
The best lack all conviction 
The centre is struggling to hold all over Europe. In Austria the mainstream parties did their best to turn politics into dull mush, yet it has suddenly turned hard and consequential. The SVO and OVP, having brought rising living standards and preserved social peace for decades, are visibly out of ideas. Many Austrians cannot take apocalyptic talk of the FPO's rise seriously. In France voters unite behind candidates they dislike to block the far-right National Front. But Mr Van der Bellen can rely on no such coalition to propel him to the presidency. For voters of a conservative bent Mr Hofer may actually represent the safer option. 
So in many respects this is an Austrian story as much as a European one. But these days every European election carries a larger meaning. Far-right parties across Europe will cheer a victory for Mr Hofer on Sunday; liberals will lament it. Austria is not about to return to the 1930s. But the election of Western Europe's first far-right head of state would still mark a solemn moment. Austria's do-nothing coalition is on the front line of a struggle that many other centrist parties across Europe are facing. Some appear to have given up. This is Austria's problem. But it is also Europe's.","One of Europe 's most steadfastly dull countries has suddenly turned interesting

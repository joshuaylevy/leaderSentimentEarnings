Charles de Gaulle once dismissed a visiting Japanese prime minister as a transistor salesman--a gibe the Japanese have neither forgotten nor forgiven. Because of good manners, and self-interest, they will not call George Bush a mere car salesman when he arrives in Tokyo on January 7th, after stops in Australia, Singapore and South Korea, for three days of talks on security, trade and world affairs. But since he will be accompanied by the bosses of General Motors, Ford and Chrysler, a car salesman is what the American president will pretend to be.
""Pretend"" because no one on either side of the Pacific seriously expects the Japanese to forsake their own well-made and affordable motor cars for dubious products from Detroit. But with America's presidential election just 11 months away, the Japanese understand Mr Bush's need to be seen as the booster of American exports and protector of American jobs. They also understand that Kiichi Miyazawa, Japan's prime minister, is destined to become the hapless fall guy--even though, after only two months in office, his popularity is already plummeting.
Deservedly so. Mr Miyazawa has mishandled every big policy initiative presented during the extraordinary session of the Diet (parliament) which started with his appointment and ended just before Christmas. First, the bills to allow Japanese soldiers to participate in United Nations peace-keeping and disaster operations had to be dropped. Then he failed to include a special tax in the new budget so Japan would not be caught dithering, in Gulf war fashion, in the next international crisis. Now he has had to abandon plans to revise Japan's money-grubbing electoral system. The electorate senses that the undoubtedly clever Mr Miyazawa is short of gumption.
His lack comes at a bad time. Like Mr Bush, Mr Miyazawa also faces a crucial test at the polls in 1992. The ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) is desperate to regain the upper-house majority that it lost after the Recruit shares-for-favours scandal two years ago. Ever since, the government has been stymied when it has tried to push controversial legislation through the Diet. Mr Miyazawa knows that he must deliver that majority in July's election or his party bosses will boot him out.
His best ploy will be to play the international statesman. Using just such a ploy, his predecessor, Toshiki Kaifu, who bungled even more disastrously at home than Mr Miyazawa, became Japan's most popular prime minister since the war. The Japanese enjoy seeing their leaders on television hobnobbing with the great around the globe.
Mr Miyazawa's difficulty is that he has only two brief opportunities to capture public attention before the Diet becomes embroiled in the annual budget debate. One is Mr Bush's visit to Japan. The other is the compromise on agricultural protection that America, the European Community and Japan will have to achieve to save the GATT's Uruguay round from acrimonious failure. In both cases, Japan will see itself giving more than it gains--so Mr Miyazawa's place in the spotlight could end up being more dangerous than valuable.
What he wants from the Americans is a ""Tokyo Declaration""--a high-minded proclamation outlining the next 50 years of cooperation between the United States and Japan to help solve the world's problems. Mr Miyazawa will propose an international conference in Tokyo to consider the economic issues confronting the Middle East; and he will join Mr Bush in stressing the need to prevent the proliferation of both nuclear and conventional weapons. All this will be drafted with fine phrases about peace and mutual understanding. Innocuous documents that promise no risk or expense go down especially well in Japan.
In return, the Japanese will let Mr Bush have his ""Action Plan"". This will be explicitly concerned with bilateral trade issues--and will give the president a few economic souvenirs to take home.
One, gift-wrapped on the eve of Mr Bush's departure from Washington, was a cut in Japan's discount rate from 5% to 4.5%--the second half-point reduction in less than two months and one which, in unlikely theory, could expand Japan's demand for American goods. Another is the squeeze that the Ministry of International Trade and Industry (MITI) has already put on Japan's car makers to limit their exports to America for at least another year. Japan's ""voluntary"" agreement to export no more than 2.3m cars a year to America was due to expire in March. The new deal will cost Japanese car companies nothing. They export only 1.8m cars a year to the United States now that their big American factories are up and running. A similar export restraint on Japanese machine-tool makers is to be extended a further two years.
MITI's other token is to get Japan's car dealers to sell American models alongside Japanese ones. The transport ministry has meanwhile agreed to relax some import requirements on American cars. Even the budget has been skewed to reap American praise after complaints that Japan has been diverting public investment into industry at the expense of ordinary Japanese people--who are then forced to put up with third-world standards of roads, airports, sanitation, housing and recreation facilities.
As a gesture to the Americans, money for the government's construction projects is to be increased by 5.3%, compared with an overall rise of 2.7% agreed on December 28th for the next fiscal year's Y72.2 trillion ($580 billion) budget. In addition, local governments are expected to spend 11% more on public works and there will be a 10.9% rise in the ""fiscal investment and loans programme"" to allow more money to find its way into public works.
All this, Mr Miyazawa can argue, is evidence that Japan is delivering on its promise to spend Y430 trillion over ten years modernising its infrastructure. True, none of Japan's promises is likely to put more than a handful of Americans back to work--but they will sound good when Mr Bush hits the campaign trail.
The question is what Mr Miyazawa will get in return. Will Mr Bush be as accommodating in the final haggling over the Uruguay round--and the necessity for Japan to open its sacred rice market to foreign growers? Probably not, in which case Mr Miyazawa's reward for playing the obliging host could be to see his support from the party and the public disappear altogether.
Balancing act
Trade could hardly fail to be at the top of George Bush's Asian agenda. America is Asia's biggest export market, buying around a third of the exports of Japan, Taiwan, South Korea and China, and a quarter of Hong Kong's. Japan, China and Taiwan together accounted for four-fifths of America's trade deficit in 1991, up from half in 1988. In most cases, however, America's deficits with Asia are not widening; they are simply not shrinking as fast as America's deficit with the rest of the world.
Indeed, although Japan's total trade surplus in 1991 reached a record $100 billion or so, its surplus with America narrowed, to an annual rate of $46 billion in the first ten months of 1991, down from $56 billion in 1988. Taiwan also trimmed its surplus with America, while America's trade with South Korea and Hong Kong is now almost in balance.
One imbalance, however, continues to balloon. China's trade surplus with America went from $4 billion in 1988 to $10.4 billion in 1990, and on one estimate soared to above $13 billion in 1991.","How times have changed .

Those whose melancholy duty it is to analyse his talks there may come to a similar conclusion.
The president arrived in Japan on January 7th hoping to depart three days later with a list of goodies that would help him get re-elected in November. But Mr Bush lost at tennis (playing the emperor and the crown prince) and did not do much better in the rest of the games. Kiichi Miyazawa, Japan's prime minister for less than three months, has been in no position to deliver anything. The Americans must take some of blame for the misunderstandings that dogged the talks.
The two leaders were supposed to have met last November. Mr Bush postponed the trip after criticism that he preferred globetrotting to fixing the economy at home. At the time, just before the 50th anniversary of the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbour, the two men had been planning to reaffirm their mutual dependence and look forward to the next 50 years of friendly co-operation. Mr Miyazawa saw this as his chance to show his famous diplomatic skills and recover some of the prestige that Japan had lost abroad through its dilly-dallying at the time of the Gulf war. Japan set to work to draft a ""Tokyo Declaration"", a high-minded document about sharing responsibility for maintaining peace and prosperity in the region.
But the moment passed. American emotions about Pearl Harbour subsided. Mr Miyazawa muffed legislation that would have allowed Japan to send troops abroad on United Nations peacekeeping missions, and thus shoulder some of the global responsibilities being talked about. Mr Bush found himself suddenly in election year. With 8.5m Americans out of work, and America's trade deficit with Japan nosing back towards $42 billion, this was, his advisers advised, the time to get tough. Bashing Japan for not buying enough goods made in America should, it was argued, go down well in Detroit.
For courtesy's sake, Mr Miyazawa has been given his Tokyo Declaration. This expresses the two countries' vague determination to work together for a new world order. But the week's meetings were mainly about an Action Plan that defines various market-opening measures that the Americans want. A third document, the Macroeconomic Accord, was also released during the meetings, due to end on January 10th. Mr Miyazawa may have thought he would spend the week looking noble on the world stage. Instead, he has been asked to make grubby concessions over money and markets.
What have the Americans gained? Two dozen Japanese companies have been bullied into buying more manufactured goods from abroad. The Action Plan talks of them buying $26.4 billion worth of foreign goods a year by early 1994, up by $10.2 billion over their imports in 1990. ""Foreign"", as all good Japanese know, means American. The Japanese may or may not chip in something towards an $8.25 billion atom-smashing machine that American scientists want to build in Texas. Nine Japanese car manufacturers have outlined plans for buying $19 billion-worth of components from America by 1994 (see page 60).
Though they are already widely known, the import targets for American cars ($6.4 billion worth by 1994) have not been put in the plan. No one in Japan wants to be blamed for breaking a written promise--as happened when the Semi-conductor Accord of 1986 recklessly guaranteed American chip makers 20% of the Japanese market. Mr Miyazawa has also offered to relax import-inspection standards that have irked the Americans on more than 50 items.
The Action Plan refers to reports by the Japanese Fair Trade Commission on practices in the motor, car-component, glass and paper industries that bar competition. The commission's investigations were approved at the Structural Impediment Initiative talks in 1990 on barriers restricting trade between Japan and America. The Action Plan calls for a ""re-invigoration"" of those talks--with some new topics added at America's insistence.
The Americans will gain access to $5 billion-worth of trade insurance covering the next five years. The cash is for underwriting Japanese overseas projects in which American firms take part, such as building power stations in Latin America and drilling for oil in Siberia. The scheme came into effect last May and has so far provided some $700m of Japanese government insurance for six overseas projects--helping American firms export $2 billion-worth of goods.
On the tricky issue of rice, the Americans have been urging Japan to accept GATT proposals for replacing import restrictions on agricultural products with tariffs. This would help bring the Uruguay round of multilateral trade talks to a successful conclusion. But the ruling Liberal Democrats are afraid of offending Japan's farmers before July's election for the upper house of the Diet (parliament). Mr Miyazawa knows that amending the law that bans all but token rice imports is out of the question. One idea being discussed is to impose huge tariffs of 700% on imported rice; another is to allow 300,000 tons of foreign rice into Japan for use in famine-relief operations elsewhere.
When are added up, the measures announced this week will buy few jobs for Americans. They may even backfire on Mr Bush in the months ahead. Expectations have been rising in Washington that Japan's latest market-opening measures are somehow different from the dozens that have gone before. All have helped, bit by bit, to make the Japanese market more accessible to foreigners, but none has allowed Japan's trading partners to eliminate their deficits. Mr Bush's efforts will be no different.
Yet in one way this week's talks have been different. They are the first bilateral negotiations between America and Japan since the collapse of Soviet communism. With the Russian presence in the Pacific diminishing, a nearly-nuclear North Korea edging out of its long period of moody isolation, and an increasingly capitalist China eager for western aid, America has quietly begun to redefine its relations with Japan. From valued ally, Japan is being cast increasingly as a dangerous competitor, more of a threat than an opportunity.
Mr Bush was said to be better after a bit of a rest.

Yet in one way this week's talks have been different. They are the first bilateral negotiations between America and Japan since the collapse of Soviet communism. With the Russian presence in the Pacific diminishing, a nearly-nuclear North Korea edging out of its long period of moody isolation, and an increasingly capitalist China eager for western aid, America has quietly begun to redefine its relations with Japan.

Mr Bush was said to be better after a bit of a rest. But for many Americans Japan is going to remain a bad taste in the mouth.
PROMISES, PROMISES
""We will stay involved,"" President Bush promised in Australia, the first stop on his Pacific tour, ""right up till the end of eternity."" Never mind the oxymoron. Mr Bush talked much more sense in Asia about the balance of power than about the balance of trade. Even so, both he and his hosts remain pretty much in the dark about America's role in Asia's defence now that the Soviet Union is gone.
How can America best perform the important function, which used to be hidden under the anti-Soviet mantle, of keeping the power balance between regional rivals like Japan, China, India and the Koreas? What is the right task and size for America's Seventh Fleet, especially in relation to Russia's Pacific fleet? Should America rely on its bilateral defence ties, or would a multilateral security system along European lines now make sense?
Nobody yet has the answers. But all agree that for Asia's stability America should not stage any immediate retreat from the region. Hence the declaration by Mr Bush's defence secretary, Richard Cheney, that after the 10% reductions in American forces in Japan and South Korea over the past two years, ""I do not expect further significant reductions in Asia for the time being, or the Pacific. It is very important that the United States stay forward deployed in the Pacific."" The president stressed the same point in his press conference in Tokyo on January 9th.
That will, however, require what American officials admit is some ""adjustment""--not least because the Philippines has at last unequivocally told the Americans to leave their Subic Bay naval base by the end of this year. America's admirals are not much fussed. They think that in these more relaxed days the tasks done at Subic can be parcelled out elsewhere.
In 1990, for example, Singapore gave American ships and fighter aircraft the right to port calls for operations and repairs. When Mr Bush arrived in Singapore after Australia, he won agreement for the transfer there of a logistics command now at Subic Bay: it will be the first permanent stationing of American forces in Singapore since 1945. America will next seek military calling rights from Malaysia, Thailand and Indonesia.
The only other urgent matter on Mr Bush's defence agenda was North Korea's nuclear programme. In South Korea, the penultimate stop on his tour, Mr Bush again demanded that the North submit to international inspection of its nuclear sites and gave warning of the danger of ""paper promises"", suggesting that he was unconvinced by the nuclear renunciation made by the North in its accord with the South on December 31st.
Inching forward, the North said this week in Vienna that it would sign a safeguards agreement with the International Atomic Energy Agency before the end of the month. Eager to please, the South promptly announced the suspension of this year's springtime military exercise with the Americans--presumably miffing Mr Bush, who had said in Seoul the exercise would be called off only after the North had submitted to inspections.
In Japan, now (with the demise of the Soviet Union) probably the world's second biggest military spender, Mr Bush and his hosts declared that in the next Gulf-like emergency America and Japan must act as fully cooperating partners. It seemed, however, that the question of how to build Asia's post-cold-war security structure was ignored. The arduous job of peddling American cars in Japan did not leave time for this minor matter.","The Tokyo summit will be recalled by most ordinary people as the time George Bush swallowed something that did not agree with him .

Burly young Japanese policemen raced into a Tokyo hospital on January 13th and hauled out a politician who had fled there in the hope of appearing too ill to be arrested. The doctors shrugged their shoulders and Fumio Abe--a former cabinet minister and an official in the party faction headed by the prime minister, Kiichi Miyazawa--was taken away to jail.
Mr Abe is accused of receiving Y80m ($630,000) from a steel-frame company called Kyowa in return for helping the firm with its projects in Hokkaido. He was the minister in charge of Hokkaido development at the time. The Tokyo public prosecutor appears to be giving Mr Abe an even harder time than when he was gunning for the politicians and civil servants involved in the Recruit shares-for-favours investigation in 1988-89. Several were accused of corruption but none was arrested. Mr Abe is in fact the first member of the Diet (parliament) to be arrested since 1976, when Kakuei Tanaka and several others were in trouble over the Lockheed bribery case.
The public prosecutor's office is sending a message to the ruling Liberal Democratic Party that it does not think much of the party's half-hearted attempt--now largely abandoned--to clean up Japanese politics. The previous prime minister, Toshiki Kaifu, tried without success to reform the Japanese electoral system, along with its insatiable appetite for campaign funds. His attempts helped make him the most popular prime minister with the public since the war. But Mr Kaifu was booted out of office by the party bigwigs. His replacement, Mr Miyazawa, promptly abandoned electoral reform. He is an old-style leader, comfortably free of reformist zeal.
The Kyowa affair is said to be the dirtiest of Japan's 15 major bribery cases since the war that have involved Diet members. Mr Abe is said by the public prosecutor to have given the firm details of the route planned for a main road in Hokkaido so that it could buy up the land beforehand. He also, it is alleged, helped to get Kyowa cheap government loans. The prosecutor's office is particularly angry that all this supposedly went on when the Recruit case was in the headlines. If the ruling party could not restrain its members then, will it ever manage to get a grip on corruption?
Mr Abe resigned his post in the Miyazawa faction last month when the investigators were closing in. He has since resigned from the ruling party, though not from the Diet. Mr Miyazawa will find it difficult to distance himself from the former minister. Mr Abe is said to have been given Y50m to pass on to his political boss. The Miyazawa faction admitted this week that it accepted a Y10m ""membership fee"" from a fund-raising group run by Mr Abe in 1989. According to a story told to the public prosecutor, the money was obtained from Kyowa and was used to buy Mr Abe a place in the Kaifu cabinet.
All told, Mr Abe is said to have pocketed Y480m ($3.8m) of Kyowa's money. Four other members of the Miyazawa faction, among them Zenko Suzuki, a former prime minister, are alleged to have received money from Kyowa. Its total pay-out to politicians is said to have topped Y2.2 billion.
The opposition parties have promised to give the government a grilling in the new parliamentary session due to start on January 24th. The Buddhist-affiliated Komeito (""clean government party"") is saying that Mr Miyazawa should take ""political and moral responsibility"" for the Kyowa affair--Diet-speak for doing the honourable thing and falling on his sword.
Even without the scandal, the prime minister is facing a tough session. The opposition parties want defence spending to be further cut in the budget for the next financial year. The government proposes to increase the defence bill by only 3.5% instead of the usual 6%, and is unwilling to see a bigger cut. If the budget is not passed before the end of March, it will have to draw up a stop-gap budget, adding to Mr Miyazawa's reputation for political bungling.
As much as the Liberal Democrats' leaders now rue the day they let Mr Miyazawa become prime minister, they know they are stuck with him--at least until the end of July. That is when half the upper-house seats are up for re-election. With the popular Mr Kaifu at the helm, the party felt it at least had a chance of narrowing the gap with the opposition in the upper house, if not actually winning back the majority it lost in the wake of the Recruit scandal. With Mr Miyazawa in charge, the party leaders fear that they could lose even more seats in the upper house. Getting controversial legislation through the Diet would then be impossible.
That is why Shin Kanemaru, the Liberal Democrats' ageing godfather and boss of the party's biggest faction, agreed last week to accept the honorary title of vice-president of the party. Mr Miyazawa has been badgering him to do so since taking office, as it would confer endorsement of his shaky administration by the party's most powerful cabal. For better or worse, Mr Kanemaru has decided that the party must close ranks if it is to fend off criticism about Mr Abe and the Kyowa scandal. What Mr Kanemaru also knows is that the Kyowa affair promises to be small beer alongside yet another political scandal now brewing. Watch for the next thrilling installment.","It was like a rerun of the Recruit bribery scandal .

The government proposes to increase the defence bill by only 3.5 % instead of the usual 6 % , and is unwilling to see a bigger cut . If the budget is not passed before the end of March , it will have to draw up a stop - gap budget , adding to Mr Miyazawa 's reputation for political bungling . 
 As much as the Liberal Democrats ' leaders now rue the day they let Mr Miyazawa become prime minister , they know they are stuck with him -- at least until the end of July . That is when half the upper - house seats are up for re - election . With the popular Mr Kaifu at the helm , the party felt it at least had a chance of narrowing the gap with the opposition in the upper house , if not actually winning back the majority it lost in the wake of the Recruit scandal . With Mr Miyazawa in charge , the party leaders fear that they could lose even more seats in the upper house . Getting controversial legislation through the Diet would then be impossible . 
 That is why Shin Kanemaru , the Liberal Democrats ' ageing godfather and boss of the party 's biggest faction , agreed last week to accept the honorary title of vice - president of the party . Mr Miyazawa has been badgering him to do so since taking office , as it would confer endorsement of his shaky administration by the party 's most powerful cabal . For better or worse , Mr Kanemaru has decided that the party must close ranks if it is to fend off criticism about Kiichi Miyazawa and the Kyowa scandal . What Mr Kanemaru also knows is that the Kyowa affair promises to be small beer alongside yet another political scandal now brewing .

Everyone had thought that Kiichi Miyazawa's government, now all of three months old, would last at least until the summer. Then the prime minister would probably resign after the miserable showing the ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) is expecting in the upper-house election in late July. But nasty things are happening to Mr Miyazawa now. A corruption scandal has again touched the government; the debate on the budget has been brought to a halt by an indignant opposition; and on February 9th the ruling party suffered a crushing defeat in a by-election. The whisper now is that Mr Miyazawa may have to go much sooner, perhaps by late March.
It is all beginning to look horribly like a rerun of the events of 1989. In that year the Recruit shares-for-favours scandal, an outraged opposition and the ensuing chaos in the Diet (parliament) forced Noboru Takeshita to resign as prime minister. The embarrassing Sosuke Uno, who replaced him, lasted only a few months--partly because of a sex scandal but mainly because he took responsibility for the Liberal Democrats' loss, after 34 years, of its majority in the upper house.
The Nara seat--a stronghold of conservatism--was lost to the Liberal Democrats at that time. Since then the party has worked hard and spent money in an effort to reclaim it. All to no avail. After the poll on February 9th an infuriated local party chief lamented, ""Our efforts to realise victory have been smashed by the scandal."" He was referring to the misfortunes of Fumio Abe, an aide of Mr Miyazawa's who was arrested on January 13th for allegedly pocketing Y80m ($640,000) in bribes from a steel-frame company called Kyowa while he was a cabinet minister.
The opposition parties in Nara united under the banner of political ethics. The 47% turnout was the highest in years for a by-election. Yukisha Yoshida, a 20-year veteran of the lower house, won the seat comfortably for Rengo-no-kai (the political arm of the Japanese trade union confederation) with 51% of the vote. Nobuharu Inoki, the Liberal Democratic candidate who held the seat until 1989, managed only 37%.
The socialists (who now call themselves, at least in English, the Social Democrats) and two small centrist groups, the Democratic Socialist Party and the United Social Democratic Party, threw their weight behind Rengo's man. With no candidate of its own, the Buddhist-affiliated Komeito (""Clean Government Party"") told its 60,000 supporters in Nara to vote as they pleased; most seem to have liked the Rengo man.
Alarmingly for the Liberal Democrats, the normally bickering opposition parties are (with the exception of the Communists) doing their best to stay united. Komeito is being asked to join the front against them, and is promising not to run a candidate of its own in the next upper-house by-election, due in Miyagi on March 8th. A lower-house by-election in Gunma will follow in late March. Two more disasters for the Liberal Democrats would make life difficult indeed for Mr Miyazawa.
All the more so if the budget remains stalled in committee. The opposition started its boycott of the budget debate on February 5th when the government refused to call Mr Abe and other members of parliament implicated in the Kyowa scandal to answer questions in the Diet. The government has offered to set up an informal committee to look into the Kyowa affair. But the opposition parties want their victims to give sworn evidence in the Diet so that, if they perjured themselves, they could be jailed.
This is a tactic the opposition parties used to great effect in 1989. The ruling party had angered the opposition by using its majority to bulldoze an unpopular consumption tax through the Diet. In retaliation, the opposition had refused to debate the budget, bringing parliamentary business to a halt for over four months. In the end the government gave in on two opposition demands. Yasuhiro Nakasone, a former prime minister and the central figure in the Recruit affair, gave evidence before the Diet. And Mr Takeshita duly announced his resignation, standing down in May 1989, despite an upper-house election that was looming in July (as it is now).
There is talk of Mr Miyazawa dissolving the lower house in late March. But talk is all it is. The previous prime minister, Toshiki Kaifu, also hinted at calling a snap election when the ruling party killed off his political reform bills. But the trap springs fast in Japan on political mice that try to roar. The words were barely out of Mr Kaifu's mouth when the party bosses turned him out of office. Mr Miyazawa perhaps has even less authority than the popular Mr Kaifu to decide on the timing of an election.
Such things are the say-so of Shin Kanemaru, the ageing godfather of the Liberal Democrats. Mr Kanemaru on February 13th proposed, perhaps mischievously, giving opposition parties a ""taste"" of power in coalition with the LDP after the upper-house election. He has little time for Mr Miyazawa, whom he regards as a prima donna. But last month he accepted the honorary title of vice-president of the party, to shore up Mr Miyazawa's administration. The bigwigs are clearly indicating that they will stick by Mr Miyazawa at least until the upper-house election is out of the way.
But they said that about Mr Takeshita when the Recruit scandal was creeping closer to his office. Mr Kanemaru and his henchmen may be able to buy off the opposition with bundles of money beneath the table, but they cannot silence the public prosecutor's men. The investigators have begun to probe the affairs of a firm called Sagawa Kyubin. The firm's Tokyo subsidiary is reported to have worked with the Inagawa-kai, a crime syndicate. Dubious loans and backhanders amounting to Y490 billion ($3.9 billion) are said to have been made to the firm's friends in the underworld and in politics. The names of more than 100 Diet members said to have been on the take have been leaked to newspapers.
Small fry have started to confess to the prosecutor and the police. The big names implicated in this new scandal are expected to be disclosed in March, when the public prosecutor's office starts feeding the newspapers with titbits provided by two of the company's former directors. When that happens the ruling party's most powerful men could be running for cover.","In the sushi bars and watering holes of Nagatacho -- the Capitol Hill of Japan -- the talk is of the coming "" March - April crisis "" .

Mr.Lee, who still keeps a sharp eye on the running of Singapore from his cabinet post as ""senior minister"", has shown little patience for the democratic and civil-libertarian advice sometimes offered by westerners. In his last years as prime minister the government severely restricted the circulation of several foreign publications for behaviour that would be considered perfectly reasonable in the West.
In a constituency meeting on February 8th, Mr Lee did it again. He warned Singapore against heeding ""liberal sociologists"" who ask for a softer and less meritocratic touch in the schools. Look how badly the British have done with that kind of policy, he said, not to mention the Americans:
This is the result of 20 years of liberal education, new ideas of education, fulfilment, creativity. You never teach the child, you engage the child. You never discipline the child, you reason with him. The result is a workforce that cannot compete.
Plenty of westerners would agree with that. But Mr Lee's latest remarks are part of a more general pattern of resistance by Asian leaders to notions about democracy and individual freedoms that most people in the West take as self-evident truths. The Asian challenge to these western notions is much more interesting than communism's ever was: Asian authoritarians argue from a position of economic and social success.
Some of them sniff a plot in the West's preoccupation with civil liberties. The chief conspiracy theorist is Malaysia's prime minister, Mahathir Mohamad, who suspects that keeping Asia down--and America's power, as embodied in the ""new world order"", up--is the real aim of western clucking over the environment and human rights. In addressing the recent summit of the Association of South-East Asian Nations, Dr Mahathir said the West was arrogant in believing that its system of democratic government was right for everyone. Democracy, he argued, brought a lot of misery to many people.
That idea was echoed a few days later by representatives of two weightier Asian powers. At the World Economic Forum in Davos in Switzerland, Noboru Takeshita, a former prime minister of Japan who is still probably his country's most powerful politician, said that, ""laudable though democracy is,"" countries that ""rush"" to it can suffer a political collapse that makes it ""more difficult to introduce market economies, and their people suffer as a result.""
Mr Takeshita was talking about Russia, and giving pretty clear backing to the line taken at Davos by China's prime minister, Li Peng. Mr Li unrepentantly said that human rights in China were not the business of outsiders. He argued that what really mattered for a country as poor as China was economic growth, which could flourish only with political and social stability.
This is the crux of the disagreement between the Asian authoritarians and western democrats. The Asians think that the economy comes first: a government's main duty is to keep the country competitive; democracy and all the rest should be thought of in terms of how well they serve economic development.
That explains why in his blast against educational relaxation Singapore's Mr Lee also attacked those who said that local companies should be encouraged at the expense of multinationals: ""Our efficiency and competitiveness will be lost."" In his hapless recent musings about America's declining work ethic, Kiichi Miyazawa, Japan's prime minister, was really saying that Japan could not allow itself to get into a similar fix.
Leaders who put competitiveness first rightly worry that the average Asian, when given his head, opts for the same indulgences as slack westerners. It is an ignoble but indicative example that, when Singapore relaxed film censorship last July, making available Hong Kong classics such as ""Erotic Ghost Story"", cinema attendance shot up from 1.5m in June to 2.5m in August. A fresh clamp-down in the autumn restored the figure to 1.5m by December.","Kiichi Miyazawa's has never been afraid to tread on the toes of western liberals .

Earlier scandals now seem likely to be eclipsed by Sagawa's, although they were important enough in their time. The Recruit scandal led to the downfall in 1989 of the then prime minister, Noboru Takeshita, ruined a dozen other leading figures in business and government, and cost the ruling Liberal Democrats the majority they had held in the upper house of the Diet (parliament) for 34 years. The Lockheed affair of 1976 culminated in a former prime minister, Kakuei Tanaka, being given a jail sentence. A scandal that emerged last month has still to run its course, but so far it has involved the arrest of a former cabinet minister, Fumio Abe, on charges of taking Y90m ($710,000) in bribes for favouring a steel-frame maker called Kyowa. The money involved in the Sagawa affair is more awesome--hundreds of billions of yen.
The company was started over 30 years ago in Kyoto with a handful of people and two bicycles. Today it is Japan's second largest parcel-delivery firm--with 25,000 employees, 14,000 lorries and sales last year of Y909 billion. The company's founder and chairman, Kiyoshi Sagawa, has the motto, ""Work twice as hard and get paid three times as much."" The company has been prosecuted frequently for breaking labour laws and transport regulations.
The police started to investigate the firm after a boardroom row last July became public. On February 13th investigators raided homes and offices and seized a mass of documents. Hiroyasu Watanabe, the former president of Sagawa's Tokyo subsidiary, and Jun Saotome, a former director, are accused of giving Y530 billion in loans and guarantees to a number of firms, with out seeking interest payments or collateral and knowing the money would never be repaid. Such ""gifts"" are illegal.
Several recipients of Sagawa's largesse were fronts for the Inagawa-kai, Japan's second largest crime syndicate. So far, Y114 billion of loans have been traced to gangland coffers. The generosity seems to have been for strong-arm favours that helped the delivery firm muscle into rival territory, acquire new routes and deal with uppity employees.
Having political friends seems to have helped Sagawa, too. Between them, they are said to have pocketed upwards of Y80 billion of Sagawa's cash. The firm lobbied to get the law on parcel delivery changed so it could operate nationally instead of just locally. The transport ministry liberalised the law in 1990. It is said that the firm was paying the salaries of several hundred personal assistants to members of the Diet. The police now have Mr Watanabe's diary, which apparently lists the various Diet offices on the payroll. Sagawa, it seems, used underworld friends to pay the politicians and keep the bribes secret. For the hapless, 14-week-old government of Kiichi Miyazawa this is yet another burden.
Shortly before his arrest, Mr Saotome claimed that politicians were coming to the firm's Tokyo offices ""almost every day"" to collect money. Yasuo Matsuzawa, the president of Heiwado Real Estate, who has been arrested for receiving illegal loans, says that some 130 Diet members were regular recipients of Sagawa's cash, and not all of them were from the ruling Liberal Democratic Party.

Employers are saying that times are hard, and meaning it. Growth could be as low as 1.7%, according to the soothsayers. In the round of pay bargaining now starting, bosses are talking of rises of no more than 2%. Bonuses this summer are likely to be the smallest for a decade.
This is bad news not only for the luckless seekers of more money, but also for the prime minister, Kiichi Miyazawa. During the four months he has had the job Mr Miyazawa has had to take the flak for two political-bribery scandals, which are still far from being resolved. Now the economy turns out to be suffering even more than was previously imagined. No wonder the prime minister's approval rating is falling, down from 55% in November to 32% in the most recent opinion poll.
His government is desperate to show that it is doing something urgent about the economy in general, and pay packets in particular. This means getting pump-priming money into public works quickly. The money has been allocated in the budget for the financial year starting on April 1st. But if the budget is to be approved by the Diet (parliament) before then, deals have to be done with the opposition parties left, right and centre. Otherwise, stop-gap measures will have to be taken to scrape enough money together to pay teachers, police, health workers and other officials. Such a course would make the government look even more inept.
The opposition parties have been harassing the government mercilessly. They blocked deliberations on the budget until Mr Miyazawa agreed that senior politicians in the ruling Liberal Democratic Party could be questioned in the Diet about bribery allegations. Two former cabinet members, one of them an ex-prime minister, Zenko Suzuki, gave evidence on February 25th. Both admitted having received money from Kyowa, a steel-frame company accused of bribing a former cabinet minister, Fumio Abe, to help it win building projects. The Liberal Democrats have now had to agree to a far more embarrassing demand, for Mr Abe to testify as well. Not only was Mr Abe a close ally of Mr Miyazawa, but also one of his party faction's biggest bagmen. He is on bail, charged with receiving Y90m ($690,000) in bribes from Kyowa.
The opposition has also demanded that a special Diet committee should be formed to investigate the Kyubin scandal, which promises to eclipse even the Recruit affair of 1989. The Tokyo branch of Sagawa Kyubin, Japan's second largest delivery firm, is alleged to have greased the palms of some 130 politicians.
To add to his misery, the socialists are demanding that Mr Miyazawa should cut proposed defence spending in the budget. Before this demand, the government was proposing to increase the defence bill by 3.8%, the lowest rise since 1960. If the socialists are to be appeased, the rise will be less than 1%. The opposition parties are also demanding a cut in the mid-term defence plan for 1991-95. The Americans are worried. James Lilley, who watches over international security for the Pentagon, was due in Tokyo on March 6th to hear what the government has to say.
America, and other countries, are no doubt surprised that the government has dumped the legislation that would have allowed Japanese servicemen to take part in United Nations peacekeeping work abroad. It was supposed to have been the cornerstone of the country's new foreign policy. But critics said it would be a step towards militarism.
With the opposition apparently contented for the moment, deliberations on the budget got going again on March 2nd. The government is braced, not too hopefully, for some crucial by-elections. The first is on March 8th, in Miyagi. Another is in Gunma later this month, and a third in Ibaraki in April. If the ruling party fares as poorly in these as it did at Nara in February, when its candidate was trounced, it can say goodbye to loosening the opposition's hold on the upper house in July's election.
Time and the opposition permitting, Mr Miyazawa does hope to get a measure of political reform enacted before the Diet session ends in June. This will include some redrawing of electoral boundaries and tighter restrictions on campaign funds. But the by-election in Miyagi this Sunday could seal his fate.","Anyone seeking a decent pay rise in Japan this year looks like being disappointed . Employers are saying that times are hard , and meaning it . Growth could be as low as 1.7 % , according to the soothsayers . In the round of pay bargaining now starting , bosses are talking of rises of no more than 2 % . Bonuses this summer are likely to be the smallest for a decade . 
 This is bad news not only for the luckless seekers of more money , but also for Kiichi Miyazawa . During the four months Kiichi Miyazawa has had the job Kiichi Miyazawa has had to take the flak for two political - bribery scandals , which are still far from being resolved . Now the economy turns out to be suffering even more than was previously imagined . No wonder Kiichi Miyazawa's approval rating is falling , down from 55 % in November to 32 % in the most recent opinion poll . 
 Kiichi Miyazawa's government is desperate to show that it is doing something urgent about the economy in general , and pay packets in particular . This means getting pump - priming money into public works quickly . The money has been allocated in the budget for the financial year starting on April 1st . But if the budget is to be approved by the Diet ( parliament ) before then , deals have to be done with the opposition parties left , right and centre . Otherwise , stop - gap measures will have to be taken to scrape enough money together to pay teachers , police , health workers and other officials . Such a course would make the government look even more inept . 
 The opposition parties have been harassing the government mercilessly . They blocked deliberations on the budget until Kiichi Miyazawa agreed that senior politicians in the ruling Liberal Democratic Party could be questioned in the Diet about bribery allegations . Two former cabinet members , one of them an ex - prime minister , Zenko Suzuki , gave evidence on February 25th . Both admitted having received money from Kyowa , a steel - frame company accused of bribing a former cabinet minister , Fumio Abe , to help it win building projects . The Liberal Democrats have now had to agree to a far more embarrassing demand , for Mr Abe to testify as well . Not only was Mr Abe a close ally of Kiichi Miyazawa , but also one of his party faction 's biggest bagmen . He is on bail , charged with receiving Y90 m ( $ 690,000 ) in bribes from Kyowa . 
 The opposition has also demanded that a special Diet committee should be formed to investigate the Kyubin scandal , which promises to eclipse even the Recruit affair of 1989 . The Tokyo branch of Sagawa Kyubin , Japan 's second largest delivery firm , is alleged to have greased the palms of some 130 politicians . 
 To add to Kiichi Miyazawa's misery , the socialists are demanding that Kiichi Miyazawa should cut proposed defence spending in the budget . Before this demand , the government was proposing to increase the defence bill by 3.8 % , the lowest rise since 1960 . If the socialists are to be appeased , the rise will be less than 1 % . The opposition parties are also demanding a cut in the mid - term defence plan for 1991 - 95 . The Americans are worried .

Italy and Japan, alone among rich countries, have political systems uncomplicated by alternating governments. For nearly 40 years the Liberal Democrats have run Japan; for nearly 50 years the Christian Democrats have dominated the coalitions--all 49 of them--that have run Italy. Both countries are democracies, but democracy without a change of government is a bit like Atlanta without a change of aircraft: missing its defining characteristic. Voting loses its point, not to mention its fun, if it never involves kicking the rascals out.
Italians will get the chance to do that on April 5th, and the Japanese will be able to do the next best thing--giving their rulers a good hack on the shins--when they go to the polls for the upper house of their parliament in July. For the first time since the second world war there is real uncertainty in Italy: the political class is expecting to measure the electoral shift reflected by the voting not in the usual millimetres, but in centimetres, maybe even in metres. In Japan he voters are already taking swipes at the government, most recently, on March 8th, by voting for the opposition candidate in a by-election. Kiichi Miyazawa, the prime minister, may lose his job if his party's fortunes do not perk up (see page 36).
No one should assume, however, that the mere unpopularity of the government will be enough to ensure its dismissal in either Italy or Japan. The change that invites speculation about the durability of the status quo in Italy is the collapse of communism. Italy has achieved its faction-ridden, paralysed and consensual political system through the joint terror of a fascist past and of a possibly communist future; democrats have combined against anti-democrats, real or imaginary. Now that the neo-fascists (adorned by Mussolini's grand-daughter) are more decorative than menacing and the communists are divided and demoralised, the anti-democrats scarcely seem worth combining against. The coalition parties like the present arrangement because it enables them to hand out jobs and patronage to their cronies. But the voters are growing weary. Hence the rise of the many protest leaves in northern Italy, and fringe parties all over.
Japan too has a faction-ridden, paralysed and consensual political system, and a wartime past even uglier than Italy's. It also has a main opposition party, the Social Democrats, as unfit for government as the Italian communists. But the Social Democrats' democratic credentials have never been in doubt; only the wisdom of their policies. So the reason Japanese voters may one day decide they need a system of alternating governments has nothing to do with the collapse of communism in Europe. It is that the current system is so dreadfully corrupt.
OF RICE AND YEN
Italy and Japan have in common some pleasant thins (a fondness for rice), some silly thing (currencies that put too many noughts on the end of every bill), some awkward things (elongated territory frequently shaken by earthquakes), some peculiar things (corporate fiefs born of city states and warlords) and some nasty thing (the Mafia and the yakuza). They also have economic systems which, despite their current troubles, have an enviable record of delivering the goods. If they are less influential in the world than their economies suggest they should be, it is because of their common political system, which produces weak governments that are one-party-dominated, consensus-hungry, decision-shy and prone to corruption. Change may not come this year, but the sooner it does the better it will be for Italians and Japanese alike.","For different reasons , two of the curiosities of the modern world may be approaching the point where they can no longer continue their common curiousness .

Inflation is below 2%, unemployment is a touch over 2%, and the economy is officially expected to grow by 2.6% this year. Yet that forecast looks wobbly, and it compares sadly with growth last year of an estimated 4.3%. Exit polls at Miyagi, where the ruling Liberal Democratic Party was defeated in a by-election on March 8th, showed that voters were disturbed not just by the political scandals shaking the government. They were equally worried about the state of the economy--and the government's seeming failure to do anything about it.
People are concerned about their summer bonuses, usually worth around 2-1/2 months' pay. Pay deals this spring are going to be lower than normal, and many Japanese are worried that there may not be enough money in their bonuses to meet bills for health and education.
The government is worried that the voters are worried. An election for half the seats in the upper house of the Diet (parliament) takes place on July 26th, just after employers hand out the summer bonuses. The Liberal Democrats currently hold 75 of the 126 upper-house seats due to be contested, and had hoped to regain the majority they had until 1989, or at least hold on to what they now have. Party officials are now gloomily predicting that the best they can expect is to retain 60 seats. That would increase the opposition's upper-house majority from 14 to 29--allowing it to bring parliamentary business to a halt should it wish to do so.
The party that has ruled Japan since the mid-1950s is having to get used to defeat. Its candidate was trounced in a by-election in Nara last month. It lost the Miyagi seat three years ago in the wake of the Recruit shares-for-favours scandal. Until then it was a Liberal Democratic stronghold. In this week's contest, the party mustered all its political and financial weight in an effort to win Miyagi back. More than 300 of its Diet members were sent to the constituency.
The party's candidate, Nobuo Onodera, is a leading local politician and a former chairman of the prefectural assembly. The candidate backed by Rengo-no-kai, Japan's biggest federation of trade unions, was a little-known college professor, Koki Hagino, who had decided to stand only ten days before the start of the campaign. The Liberal Democrat was only narrowly beaten, but what unnerved the party's local workers was the realisation that, had the central office not mounted such a heavyweight campaign, the rout would have been as devastating as it was in Nara.
Two more by-elections are due--in Gunma on March 29th and in Ibaraki on April 12th. Then, on to the July campaign, in which the issues are likely to be those that were prominent in Miyagi, namely scandals and the economy. The Reno candidate there never missed a chance to criticise the prime minister, Kiichi Miyazawa, and his government for failing to explain their involvement in the latest pair of political scandals.
In one, Fumio Abe, a close aide of Mr Miyazawa and a former cabinet minister, is accused of receiving Y90m ($680,000) for helping a steel-frame company called Kyowa win building contracts. In the other affair, some 130 Diet members--including several bigwigs from the ruling party--are said to have been in the pocket of a trucking firm, Sagawa Kyubin, and its gangster friends. The Sagawa affair is still being investigated by the Tokyo public prosecutor's office. When all the details come out, the case is expected to eclipse even the Recruit scandal in terms of the sums involved and the reputations destroyed.
The opposition parties are not as clean as they make out. But at least they have been moving swiftly to stamp out corruption within their own houses. On March 10th the Social Democrats forced one of their lower-house members, Kenichi Ueno, to resign his seat in the Diet. Mr Ueno is alleged to have received around Y10m in handouts from a developer called Mariya.
As for the economy, Mr Miyazawa wants to rustle up some extra money to pour into public works, to get things moving. The quarterly survey of business confidence by the Bank of Japan on March 6th was the gloomiest since the doom-laden days after the stockmarket crash of 1987. Everyone is expecting a further cut in the discount rate, probably before the month is out.
The Liberal Democrats, in particular, have been badgering the bank's governor, Yasushi Mieno, to cut the interest rate. A veiled threat came from Shin Kanemaru, the Liberal Democrats' godfather, who implied that the governor's job was a political appointment. The independently minded Mr Mieno snapped back that cutting interest rates was none of the government's business. By continuing to demand a reduction in the discount rate, the party is out to win credit for the cut that will come when Mr Mieno decides the time is right. That is a measure of how desperate Mr Miyazawa and his government have become.","Many finance ministers in recession hit countries would consider themselves fortunate to have the problems of Japan .

After two recent by-election disasters, voters in Gunma on March 29th gave the Liberal Democrats the victory they had been anxiously seeking. Its candidates won both lower-house seats. One seat had previously been held by the ruling party, the other by the opposition Social Democrats. Between them, the winners garnered 72% of the votes cast. The loudest sighs of relief were heard in the residence of Japan's hard-pressed prime minister, Kiichi Miyazawa.

Mr Miyazawa has been wisely keeping his head down and his mouth shut. Since taking office in November, his approval rating measured by opinion polls has sunk from 56% to 26%. Even within his party there is little sympathy for the haughty Mr Miyazawa. But with half the 256 seats in the upper house up for re-election in July, senior ruling-party officials have agreed to rescue his administration from disaster.

The officials' attention is beginning to pay off. Not only did the money machine produce the right result in Gunma, but a strategy for fighting July's election has begun to emerge as well. A central element is the effort the government made this week to stimulate the economy. Compared with this time last year, the government is to spend an extra Y5 trillion ($38 billion), mainly on public works. The discount rate has been cut by 3/4%, brining it down to 3-3/4%. Although voters remain angry with the Liberal Democrats for failing to mend their money-grubbing ways, they are worried much more about what will happen to their summer bonuses. Boosting the economy is designed to cheer them up.

The Liberal Democrats are now gunning for the Rengo-no-kai--the body formed three years ago by the 7.7m strong Rengo (Trade Union Confederation) to field candidates against the ruling party. In its first outing during the upper-house election in 1989, Rengo candidates won 11 of the 12 seats they contested. In February a little-known Rengo candidate crushed the Liberal Democrats' choice in the by-election for an upperhouse seat in Nara. A month later Rengo won a by-election in Miyagi.

The Social Democrats fielded their own candidate at Gunma, and lost. But each time they and other non-communist opposition parties have united behind a Rengo candidate, the union man has won. The Rengo jinx has begun to unnerve the Liberal Democrats. Rengo has made it clear that it intends to put up more than 20 candidates in the July election. If it maintains its record, Rengo could become the second-largest opposition group in the upper house. The rattled ruling party is already unable to get its more controversial bills through the Diet since losing control of the upper house in the wake of the Recruit shares-for-favours scandal in 1989. In the elections in July it would dearly love to loosen the opposition's hold over the upper house, in preparation for winning back control in 1995.

Some of the Liberal Democrats' top brass have stared pointing out that a vote for Rengo is, in effect, a vote for the Social Democrats. And they are attacking Rengo's lack of policies. The union group admits that its sole purpose is to win seats, not to promote policies.

The Liberal Democrats have been hinting that a lower-house election may be called at the same time as the upper-house one in July. This would be a severe blow to the opposition. Only the ruling party, with its huge war-chest, long list of candidates, extensive network of grassroots supporters and intimate connections with big business, can afford to fight elections in both houses at the same time.

Normally, Mr Miyazawa (assuming he is still prime minister) would not have to call a general election until next year. But there are many in the party with fond memories of how a double election in 1986 produced a landslide victory for them in both houses--and gave the then prime minister, Yasuhiro Nakasone, an unprecedented third term in office.

However, the talk about a double election may be designed only to frighten the Komeito (Clean Government Party) and the Democratic Socialist Party--two small groups that hold the balance of power in the upper house--into supporting the government's peacekeeping bill. If passed, this would allow Japanese soldiers to be sent abroad on United Nations peacekeeping operations.

Left to his own devices, Mr Miyazawa was expected to do badly in the upper-house election. With the party machine behind him, he may now have a chance to chip away at the opposition's majority. Will that persuade his party bosses to let him stay on after the election? Probably not.","The big - money election machine of Japan 's ruling Liberal Democratic Party has at last gone into gear .

Far from winning important political and economic concessions from Japan, Mr Jiang has had to return home more or less empty-handed. All he came away with on April 10th at the end of his five-day visit was a promise to swap panda bears for breeding purposes, a handful of cultural exchanges and a $1m donation towards restoring some cultural monuments in Turfan.

Mr Jiang is the most senior Chinese leader to visit Japan since the massacre of students in Tiananmen Square three years ago. The official visit was billed as an occasion for laying the foundation for friendly ties in the 21st century. Not only was it a disappointment for China, but it also fell short of Japan's hopes.

Kiichi Miyazawa, the Japanese prime minister, had hoped that China would endorse, rather than knock, the bill he is trying to get though the Diet (parliament) which would allow Japanese soldiers to join United Nations peacekeepers in places like Cambodia. The issue was very delicate""  said Mr Jiang. In his view Japan should use its cash  rather than its soldiers  to foster peace and development. Mr Jiang wanted to fix a date for a state visit to China by the Japanese emperor and empress. The Chinese would like the Japanese royal couple to attend celebrations in Beijing marking the 20th anniversary of the normalisation of diplomatic relations between the two countries. Such a visit  it is believed in Beijing  would seal Sino-Japanese relations at the highest level--and make it difficult for Japan to remain cool to further requests for technical co-operation and financial aid. Mr Jian went so far as to say that no ""unreasonable demands"" would be attached to a state visit. In other words  China would not expect the emperor to apologise for the Japanese occupation  as he had to apologise to South Korea's visiting president in 1990. Mr Miyazawa told his guest coolly that he would let him know later about a state visit. Japan is nervous about involving the emperor--a ""symbol of state""--in political affairs  especially those as sensitive as Sino-Japanese relations. The Japanese are angry at China's renewed claim to a small group of islands  the Senkaku  between Japan and Taiwan. Large oil deposits are said to lie beneath their surrounding seas. Powerful figures in Japan's ruling Liberal Democratic Party have been pressing Mr Miyazawa not to concede anything to the Chinese as long as they persist in making such territorial claims and  in addition  threaten to seek war reparations. A bill demanding that the Japanese government pays Y24 trillion ($180 billion) to compensate war victims was presented to China's National People's Congress in March. Mr Jiang refused to say anything about China's plans for its burgeoning arms sales to trouble-makers abroad. Japan has offered to give money and manpower to set up a UN arms register  but this ""big idea"" is getting nowhere with China. As a result of such lack of co-operation  the Japanese  though not exactly losing patience with China  are beginning to see greater opportunities for diplomatic success elsewhere in the region. Relations with North Korea and Cambodia are looming far larger. Mr Jiang played down talk about North Korea being close to making the bomb. But the mere idea of having such a bankrupt  isolated and neurotically suspicious neighbour tinkering with plutonium makes Japan deadly serious about improving its relations with North Korea. Through a series of meetings touching on the possibility of providing reparations as well as economic aid  Japanese diplomats have been slowly encouraging North Korea to abandon its isolation. On April 3rd North Korea's UN envoy  Han Si Hae  told friendly journalists in Tokyo that a safeguards agreement  allowing inspectors into the country's nuclear plants  would be ratified shortly--probably during the Supreme People's Assembly that began on April 8th. A list of sites  including the controversial plant in Yongbyon that American spy satellites indicate is a bomb factory  would be released to the International Atomic Energy Agency in late May. In Cambodia the Japanese are welcome. They have a fairly clean war record there. With the civil war supposedly over  Japan is eager to help out in the transitional administration leading to a general election. The Japanese government has offered to make a ""substantial contribution"" to the estimated cost of the UN's work in Cambodia. What with monitoring a ceasefire  disarming the rival armies and helping to resettle 350 000 refugees  the total UN bill is expected to amount to $2 billion. Apart from providing cash  Japan also plans to send people to Cambodia to help clear the mines and rebuild the 3 000 or more bridges destroyed during 13 years of fighting. First  though  Japan needs to get a bill through the Diet to lift the constitutional ban on allowing soldiers to be sent abroad  even as specialists on humanitarian missions. In the upper house of the Diet  where the ruling party does not have a majority  the opposition has in the past blocked the bill  saying that it is a step towards militarisation. Recently  however  the bill has inched towards approval. The socialist prime minister of Cambodia  Hun Sen  has been pressing socialists in Japan to end their opposition to the bill. The ruling Liberal Democrats have begun to feel that they may eventually get their peacekeeping legislation through. Japanese soldiers could then begin to shoulder some of the country's diplomatic duties abroad--and never mind what the Chinese think.""","The military adventures of Japan in the 1930s and 1940s have long been used by China to make the Japanese feel at a disadvantage .

Their first overseas mission for 47 years will be to help the United Nations keep the peace in Cambodia.

The last time Japanese soldiers set sail was to try to repulse the American landing in Okinawa of April 1945. Some 12,500 Americans died during 82 days of fighting. The typhoon of steel"" is reckoned also to have claimed the lives of more than 100 000 Japanese soldiers  plus some 140 000 Okinawans used as cannon fodder. The 1.2m people in Okinawa have never quite forgiven the mainland Japanese for that sacrifice. The Ryukyu islands (of which Okinawa is the biggest) were an independent kingdom for 450 years until annexed by Japan in 1879. The inhabitants were forbidden to speak their own language  forced to pledge allegiance to the Japanese emperor and generally discriminated against. Then  at the end of the second world war  they were told to fight to the death as honourable Japanese. Dutifully they did  only to find themselves betrayed when in 1951 the authorities in Tokyo ceded the islands to the Americans so that the rest of Japan might be free of the occupying forces. The Americans ended their ownership of Okinawa in 1972. This Friday  May 15th  the 20th anniversary of that event was due to be celebrated at ceremonies attended by Dan Quayle  the American vice-president  Mr Miyazawa and other big wigs. Pointedly  the ceremonies were being held in Tokyo--not Naha  the capital of Okinawa. A bomb was thrown perilously close to Emperor Akihito when he visited Naha as crown prince in 1975. Reminders of the war are abundant in Okinawa. As part of the 1972 deal to regain possession of the Ryukyu islands  Japan granted the Americans 20-year leases on their military bases there and has paid the rent on them to local landlords ever since. The leases are being renewed  although for how long has not yet been decided. The 43 bases  with their 29 000 military personnel (mostly marines)  cover 240 square kilometres (92 square miles). Three-quarters of the land occupied by American bases in Japan is in the islands. There is another sore point. Twenty years ago the Y15.5 billion (worth $50m then) in rent and wages earned each year by local residents from the bases accounted for more than 15% of Okinawa's income. Today the bases  with their 8 000 local employees  are still the largest employer in Okinawa  but their Y91 billion ($700m) contribution amounts to no more than 5% of income in the Okinawa prefecture. Okinawans have become richer over the past 20 years  but not as rich as they had hoped. In 1972 the income of Okinawans was only 55% of the national average. The authorities in Tokyo then promised to raise it to 80% and to increase manufacturing's share of the local economy from 9% to 18%. But the living standard in Okinawa is still only 75% of the national average. Okinawans have become more hooked than ever on handouts--now 30% of their income. Worse  manufacturing has shrunk to 6% (compared with 29% for Japan as a whole). Unemployment  at 4%  is nearly twice the national average. The deindustrialisation of Okinawa has been driven by tourism. The number of visitors has soared from 440 000 in 1972 to more than 3m in 1991. The government aimed to double the number of tourists in Okinawa by the end of the decade to 6m-7m a year. But the island's golden beaches are being spoilt by mud and sewage from the development already taking place. The great coral reefs are visibly dying from pollution. Until recently  the strongest supporters of the American presence in Okinawa were the 28 000 landowners who received fat rents for the bases.

Many people in Okinawa would like Mr Quayle to put their minds at rest.""","With the backdoor deals now done , Kiichi Miyazawa's is about to get a bill through the Diet ( parliament ) that will allow Japanese soldiers to be sent abroad again . Their first overseas mission for 47 years will be to help the United Nations keep the peace in Cambodia . 

 The last time Japanese soldiers set sail was to try to repulse the American landing in Okinawa of April 1945 . Some 12,500 Americans died during 82 days of fighting . The typhoon of steel "" is reckoned also to have claimed the lives of more than 100 000 Japanese soldiers   plus some 140 000 Okinawans used as cannon fodder . The 1.2 m people in Okinawa have never quite forgiven the mainland Japanese for that sacrifice . The Ryukyu islands ( of which Okinawa is the biggest ) were an independent kingdom for 450 years until annexed by Japan in 1879 . The inhabitants were forbidden to speak their own language   forced to pledge allegiance to the Japanese emperor and generally discriminated against . Then   at the end of the second world war   they were told to fight to the death as honourable Japanese . Dutifully they did   only to find themselves betrayed when in 1951 the authorities in Tokyo ceded the islands to the Americans so that the rest of Japan might be free of the occupying forces . The Americans ended their ownership of Okinawa in 1972 . This Friday   May 15th   the 20th anniversary of that event was due to be celebrated at ceremonies attended by Dan Quayle   the American vice - president   Mr Miyazawa and other big wigs . Pointedly   the ceremonies were being held in Tokyo -- not Naha   the capital of Okinawa . A bomb was thrown perilously close to Emperor Akihito when he visited Naha as crown prince in 1975 . Reminders of the war are abundant in Okinawa . As part of the 1972 deal to regain possession of the Ryukyu islands   Japan granted the Americans 20 - year leases on their military bases there and has paid the rent on them to local landlords ever since . The leases are being renewed   although for how long has not yet been decided . The 43 bases   with their 29 000 military personnel ( mostly marines )   cover 240 square kilometres ( 92 square miles ) . Three - quarters of the land occupied by American bases in Japan is in the islands . There is another sore point . Twenty years ago the Y15.5 billion ( worth $ 50 m then ) in rent and wages earned each year by local residents from the bases accounted for more than 15 % of Okinawa 's income . Today the bases   with their 8 000 local employees   are still the largest employer in Okinawa   but their Y91 billion ( $ 700 m ) contribution amounts to no more than 5 % of income in the Okinawa prefecture . Okinawans have become richer over the past 20 years   but not as rich as they had hoped . In 1972 the income of Okinawans was only 55 % of the national average . The authorities in Tokyo then promised to raise it to 80 % and to increase manufacturing 's share of the local economy from 9 % to 18 % . But the living standard in Okinawa is still only 75 % of the national average . Okinawans have become more hooked than ever on handouts -- now 30 % of their income . Worse   manufacturing has shrunk to 6 % ( compared with 29 % for Japan as a whole ) . Unemployment   at 4 %   is nearly twice the national average . The deindustrialisation of Okinawa has been driven by tourism . The number of visitors has soared from 440 000 in 1972 to more than 3 m in 1991 . Kiichi Miyazawa aimed to double the number of tourists in Okinawa by the end of the decade to 6m-7 m a year . But the island 's golden beaches are being spoilt by mud and sewage from the development already taking place . The great coral reefs are visibly dying from pollution . Until recently   the strongest supporters of the American presence in Okinawa were the 28 000 landowners who received fat rents for the bases . But with hotels and other tourist facilities in demand   they now want to have either their land back for development or a 20 - fold increase in rents . Kiichi Miyazawa has offered a little over 10 % and is using the threat of confiscation to beat the landowners down .

Yawara Hata, a respected 81-year-old left-winger, had been expecting to coast to a sixth four-year-term. Saitama is one of only four socialist strongholds among Japan's 47 prefectures. But last week Mr Hata unexpectedly said he was stepping down. Odder still, the ruling Liberal Democratic Party then tried to get its own man, Yoshihiko Tsuchiya, to pull out of the contest. What was happening?
Back in February the Liberal Democrats' leaders persuaded Mr Tsuchiya to stand for the governorship. They saw him as a strong candidate. As a former speaker of the upper house of the Diet (parliament), Mr Tsuchiya has the rank of an ex-prime minister, and he agonised before agreeing to let himself be ""demoted"" as a candidate for a mere governorship. Belatedly, the ruling party found to its horror that Mr Tsuchiya had no hope against the popular Mr Hata. Not only would their man lose, but he would have to surrender his own upper-house seat (also in Saitama) three weeks beforehand. This would mean a by-election, which the party might also lose. And all this on the eve of the main upper-house elections in July.
That was when the long shadow of Shin Kanemaru, the ageing don of the Liberal Democrats, flitted across Saitama. He struck a deal with the Social Democrats (formerly the socialists). They would dump Mr Hata. In exchange, the Liberal Democrats would have Mr Tsuchiya stand down, and back any candidate of the opposition's choosing, provided that the ruling party could claim to have forced Mr Hata from office. Social Democrats were to be taken care of in other ways--possibly even having a few of them in the next government.
What followed might have surprised even Machiavelli. On May 11th Mr Hata declared his ""100% commitment"" to stand for re-election. Next day newspapers splashed a story leaked by Kyowa Saitama Bank about large donations to a religious organisation from a big construction firm. The religious group turned out to have close connections with Mr Hata's office. By the afternoon the governor had announced that he would not be standing for re-election after all.
Accusations were made about bid-rigging for building contracts worth Y82 billion ($635m) handed out by the Saitama prefectural government. The Fair Trade Commission had been investigating 66 building firms in Saitama for operating a cartel. Three days after the story broke--and Mr Hata had called it quits--the commission dropped its case. Why should it do that? Good question, agree local residents.
Now the Liberal Democrats cannot deliver their side of the bargain: Mr Tsuchiya is refusing to stand down. Many Saitama voters are angry enough to cast their vote for anybody but the ruling party's man. It looks as though the ruling party faces the prospect of two highly conspicuous and humiliating defeats in Saitama.
The likely upshot is that a head or two will roll. Ichiro Ozawa was forced to resign as secretary-general of the Liberal Democrats when he backed the wrong man in the Tokyo governor's election in April 1991. Once again it was the party's secretary-general, now Tamisuke Watanuki, who backed the wrong candidate this time. So did the prime minister, Kiichi Miyazawa.

On May 22nd Morihiro Hosokawa, the former governor of Kumamoto on the southern island of Kyushu, registered a new political party, the New Japan Party (it sounds better in Japanese). Its aim is to decentralise a government that Mr Hosokawa calls ""rigid, outmoded and yoked to vested interests"". It is unlikely to succeed. But many people in provincial Japan would like to see it try and may well support it in the election for the upper house of the Diet (parliament) on July 26th.
Mr Hosokawa, grandson of a pre-war prime minister and the 18th-generation head of an aristocratic family, must first find some candidates. Household names such as Akio Morita, the founder and chairman of Sony, and various media types have been touted as possible candidates (they have not, it should be added, put themselves forward). With the polls emphasising popular disenchantment with all the main political parties, Mr Hosokawa's new group could easily garner 3m-4m votes--allowing it to take four or five upper-house seats from the Liberal Democrats.
That may not sound much. But it is enough to alarm the ruling party. Three years ago, in the wake of the Recruit shares-for-favours scandal, the Trade Union Confederation set up Rengo-no-Kai to fight the last upper-house election (half of the 252 seats are contested every three years). To the Liberal Democrats' consternation, 11 of the 12 Rengo candidates won hands down, and so helped to deprive the ruling party of the majority it had held in the upper house for the previous 34 years.
Ever since, despite the LDP's comfortable majority in the more powerful lower house, the opposition has been able to frustrate much of the government's legislation. Last year the LDP sacked Toshiki Kaifu, a popular prime minister who might have won the party an upper-house victory, and replaced him with Kiichi Miyazawa. He has since proved so maladroit that the party now knows it will be 1995 at the earliest before it can regain a majority. In the meantime it must make do by greasing palms and making deals.
The opposition parties have mostly gone along with this cosy arrangement. But not the Communists and, more importantly, not Rengo. With a grassroots organisation and 8m paid-up members, the trade unions have refused to be bought off. In the run-up to this year's upper-house election, Rengo has twice trounced the LDP in by-elections--and is expected to gain further upper-house seats come July. Not surprisingly, nobbling Rengo has become the Liberal Democrats' obsession.
Is Mr Hosokawa's party a Rengo in the making? Politically, they could not be further apart. The 54-year-old Mr Hosokawa was an LDP member of the upper house for 12 years before spending eight years as governor of his ancestral prefecture. Many believe the aristocrat has blundered by arrogantly turning against his old friends and political allies. ""As lord of the manor,"" say LDP stalwarts, ""he wants to ride in the palanquin.""
Maybe so, but in its short existence, Mr Hosokawa's party has attracted plenty of well-wishers from outside the LDP. Keigo Ouchi, chairman of the small but respected Democratic Socialist Party, has praised Mr Hosokawa for breaking away from the political mainstream. So has Osamu Shibuya, leader of the New Wave ginger group within the Social Democratic Party. Both opposition groups say they are prepared to work closely with Mr Hosokawa's party if he gets some of his candidates into parliament. The Buddhist-affiliated Komeito (Clean Government Party) is less sure. With financial scandals of its own to hide, the Komeito is as worried as the LDP about the electoral damage that a prissily clean party like Mr Hosokawa's may inflict.
Some suspicious folk meanwhile maintain that the New Japan Party is really nothing more than a secret Liberal Democratic plot to thwart Rengo. Noboru Takeshita, the former prime minister and one of the triumvirate that runs the LDP, is an old friend of Mr Hosokawa's. Rumours persist that the two of them are colluding to deny Rengo the support that it might otherwise expect in this July's poll.

The question is how big a boost.

Some form of supplementary budget, to help cope with wage increases, typhoon relief and other such regular pressures on the economy, is a routine affair. But what increasing numbers of businessmen are hoping for is the big countercyclical boost last used in 1987, when today's prime minister, Kiichi Miyazawa, was finance minister: Y1 trillion ($7.8 billion) would, they say, be too puny; Y5 trillion, mainly through public-works' projects, would be a lot better.

Salomon Brothers, an American investment bank, is predicting the Y5 trillion stimulus, and says it would raise economic output in the financial year ending next March by 2.4%. Otherwise, Salomon says, GNP will grow by only 1.3%. That compares with the optimistic official target of 3.5%.

Fortunately for the business lobby, the Liberal Democrats' godfather""  Shin Kanemaru  agrees on the need for action. Before leaving for America on June 2nd to meet President Bush  he said a supplementaly budgt of Y7 trillion was required. If so  Mr Bush will be as pleased as any Tokyo businessman; growth in Japan could give some timely encouragement in an election year to the American economy. Yet Japan's powerful bureaucrats are far from convinced that so large a stimulus is required. The finance ministry does not want to abandon the path of fiscal rectitude; and the Economic Planning Agency does not think that the overt symptoms of financial distress--a sick stockmarket  near stagnant growth in the money-supply and credit  and Y60 trillion of dodgy debt in the banking system--indicate grievous ill-health in the ""real"" economy  where unemployment still afflicts only 2% of the workforce. One senior EPA official likes to compare the state of the Japanese economy to an aeroplane which has descended from 20 000 ft to 10 000 ft: it may have fallen a long way but it is still cruising at a comfortable altitude. But the analogy is not entirely soothing. The EPA is gambling that the economy will pick up speed of its own accord in the autumn  and before it descends too low. So far the descent has been rather steep: industrial production fell by 5.5% year-on-year in April  while shipments of capital goods (excluding transport equipment) plunged by 10.2%. This suggests large cuts in capital spending. The pessimism will not fade quickly. Last month the Ministly of International Trade and Industry published a survey of 650 companies: 78.5% of them said business conditions were bad; only 2.9% said they were good. The reaction of many leading companies is to freeze the salaries of middle managers and directors and announce sharp cuts in the number of graduates they plan to hire next year.

With the Russian president, Boris Yeltsin, expected in Tokyo on September 13th for a four-day visit, officials of the Japanese foreign ministry again prepared to put their case for regaining the islands. They will not be needed, not for the time being anyway. At the last moment Mr Yeltsin postponed his trip until December, possibly indefinitely. It seems he could not stomach another discussion about the islands. In bringing them up yet again the Japanese may have overplayed their hand.
Japan has insisted that it will not discuss the economic aid Russia desperately wants until the issue of the islands is resolved. The result has been to back Mr Yeltsin into a corner. Any surrender of territory would be attacked by his nationalist opponents. An opinion poll published in Moscow this week said that 60% of Russians oppose returning the islands. In an interview on Tokyo television on September 5th Mr Yeltsin said, in effect, that he would not be surrendering the islands during his visit.
Mr Yeltsin's snub to Japan by calling off the trip is a blow for the Japanese foreign ministry. Recently it has been playing down talk of an immediate settlement. Suggestions have been made that Japan would be content if the Russians conceded sovereignty of the islands without withdrawing immediately. But there is no hint that Japan is prepared to abandon its quest, even though polls suggest most Japanese people do not care much about the islands. The waters around the islands have value as fishing grounds, but the islands themselves are largely uninhabitable, unless you happen to be a Russian.
Neither does Japan have an unchallengeable legal claim to the islands. The foreign ministry likes to produce 17th century maps of the area showing that the islands were then Japanese. It dismisses claims by the Russians that they used to tax the islanders as ""some Cossacks collecting furs"".
More tellingly, in 1951 Japan included two of the islands, Etorofu and Kunashiri, in a formal renunciation of its claim to the Kuriles. In 1956 it was prepared to settle the islands issue in return for Shikotan and the Habomai rocks. But this was when the cold war was at its coldest. America wanted to keep the Soviet Union and Japan at loggerheads. The secretary of state, John Foster Dulles, told the Japanese to renew their claims to Etorofu and Kunashiri.
The Americans still formally support Japan's claim. But when the Japanese prime minister, Kiichi Miyazawa, last visited Washington he was told to give Mr Yeltsin a break. The Americans are far more interested in Japan helping Russia economically than they are about the islands. This will not have been lost on Mr Yeltsin.","Diplomats in Japan have grown old with the issue : the country 's demand for the return of four islands in the Kuriles , seized by the Soviet Union in 1945 , in the closing day of the second world war .

But there is no hint that Japan is prepared to abandon its quest , even though polls suggest most Japanese people do not care much about the islands . The waters around the islands have value as fishing grounds , but the islands themselves are largely uninhabitable , unless you happen to be a Russian . 
 Neither does Japan have an unchallengeable legal claim to the islands . The foreign ministry likes to produce 17th century maps of the area showing that the islands were then Japanese . It dismisses claims by the Russians that they used to tax the islanders as "" some Cossacks collecting furs "" . 
 More tellingly , in 1951 Japan included two of the islands , Etorofu and Kunashiri , in a formal renunciation of its claim to the Kuriles . In 1956 it was prepared to settle the islands issue in return for Shikotan and the Habomai rocks . But this was when the cold war was at its coldest . America wanted to keep the Soviet Union and Japan at loggerheads . The secretary of state , John Foster Dulles , told the Japanese to renew their claims to Etorofu and Kunashiri . 
 The Americans still formally support Japan 's claim . But when Kiichi Miyazawa , last visited Washington Kiichi Miyazawa was told to give Mr Yeltsin a break . The Americans are far more interested in Japan helping Russia economically than they are about the islands . This will not have been lost on Mr Yeltsin .",740,Japan,A29-8185,IN TERM,True,"the Japanese prime minister , Kiichi Miyazawa",2,True

Since the 1970s, when anti-pollution demonstrators trapped businessmen in their buildings and the government hustled through 14 environmental laws in a single year, Japan has invested massively in pollution prevention. The country's businessmen like to tell each other that their pollution controls are the toughest in the world; and they are probably right.
But they are about to come under pressure to do more. Japan's attack on dirty air at home gave it a competitive edge in the world's markets for cars and air-pollution equipment. Now the government hopes to do much the same with global pollution. Japanese companies have been thinking up ways to get rid of ozone-depleting chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs): for instance, NEC, a computer manufacturer, now engraves electronic chips with lasers, a technique that costs less than older methods that used CFCs to clean the chips. The Keidanren, a big-business club, is talking to China about that fast-developing country's energy policy: China's filthy coal-fired plants, which Japan has the technology to clean, shower acid rain on Japan's forests.
Most intriguing, though, is the government's enthusiasm for ways to curb global warming by reducing Japan's output of carbon dioxide. The government has promised that, by the end of the century, the output of carbon dioxide per person will be held at the 1990 level. Japan's output of the as stabilised in the 1970s (see chart), after a big rise in the oil price; after the yen price of oil collapsed in the early and mid-1980s, output of the as began to rise again. (Chart omitted)
The main source of this increase has been transport: the boom of the 1980s led to a taste for petrol-guzzling cars. New Japanese cars averaged 13 km (eight miles) to the litre in 1981; by 1988 they did only 11.6 km. That is equal to 27.3 miles to the American gallon, less than the 28 miles per gallon achieved by the average new American car. Japan's car makers say the trend to bigger cars is continuing. Overall, the country's appetite for energy grew by 5% a year in the fiscal years of 1987 and 1988, and was still growing by 2.7% in 1991.
The international trade and industry ministry, MITI, is running a large programme of research into ways to curb the output of carbon dioxide, much of it paid for by the main fuel-gobbling industries. The government wonders whether to go further, and introduce economic rewards and punishments. As so often in Japanese environmental policy, the various interested ministries are at loggerheads.
The battleground is a new law to cover international environmental issues, promised by the prime minister, Kiichi Miyazawa. The environment agency would like the law to make it easier to introduce new green taxes. Its panel of experts on global warming has called for a carbon tax, to the indignation of industrialists.
MITI, though, wants to design the new law itself. It prefers a mixture of subsidies for energy conservation, and penalties on companies that use energy wastefully. But a lot of industrialists suspect that MITI, which has been deprived of some of its sway over companies by deregulation, sees energy conservation as a way to regain influence. They also think that those penalties might come to look surprisingly like a tax, whose proceeds would conveniently end up in MITI's budget, not in that of the finance ministry.
Not surprisingly, lots of Japanese companies are keen on the idea of subsidies to encourage investment in energy conservation. Other industrial countries might feel differently. If Japan were to subsidise some of its most successful export industries, in the virtuous cause of curbing global warming, some countries might decide that a level playing field was more important than a cool planet.","ON THE subject of pollution , Japanese businessmen are apt to sound smug .

It is true that the affair is an intricate one. But for those prepared to persevere there is the reward of a tale involving huge sums of money, gansterism and the murky side of politics. It stands to compare with the most famous scandals of the post-war years, the Lockheed and the Recruit shares-for-favours affairs.
The Japanese had a taste of all this with the appearance in court on September 22nd of Hiroyasu Watanabe, the former president of Sagawa's Tokyo subsidiary. Mr Watanabe was sacked from the company last summer and subsequently charged with breach of trust for handing out hundreds of billions of yen in loans and loan guarantees without asking for interest or collateral. The recipients are said to have included leading politicians.
In his opening statement to the court the public prosecutor linked Mr Watanabe--who denies everything--with Susumu Ishii, a former boss of Inagawa-kai, Japan's second-biggest crime syndicate. Ishii was a modern-minded gangster who understood the game of finance. He was linked to a scandal involving securities which led to the resignations of the chairman and president of Nomura, Japan's biggest stockbroking firm. Ishii died of a cerebral haemorrhage in September 1991, aged 67, before he could be interrogated thoroughly. But by naming Ishii in connection with the Sagawa Kyubin case, the public prosecutor has further undermined the standing of Shin Kanemaru, the 77-year-old godfather of Japanese politics. Such was doubtless the prosecutor's intention.
Mr Kanemaru resigned on August 27th from the titular post of vice-president of the Liberal Democrats after admitting receiving Y500m ($4.1m) from Sagawa Kyubin, though he claimed the money was actually handed to an aide. He is now desperately trying to resist prosecutors' repeated demands that he should submit to questioning over his acceptance of this undeclared political gift. Japanese law prohibits political donations of more than Y1.5m a year. On September 24th Mr Kanemaru apparently agreed through his lawyers to submit a written statement admitting he received the money. He has, however, threatened to resign from the Diet (parliament) if he is charged with breaking the law on political gifts.
So the linking in court of Ishii with Mr Watanabe has come at a bad time for Mr Kanemaru. By implication, Mr Kanemaru is being associated with gangster money, a matter noted in Japanese newspapers. According to the prosecutor's statement, Mr Watanabe became friendly with Ishii after he asked the gangster in September 1987 to help him suppress a campaign of harassment by an extremist group against Noboru Takeshita. The dominant Takeshita faction in the Liberal Democratic Party is headed by Mr Kanemaru. According to Japanese newspapers, Mr Kanemaru sought Mr Watanabe's help to protect Mr Takeshita. The harassment stopped and Mr Takeshita later became prime minister, though he resigned over the Recruit scandal.
The prosecutor told the court that Mr Watanabe developed his relationship with Ishii by lending him huge amounts of money. Ishii used this money to help finance an attempt to corner the shares of Tokyu Corporation, a big railway company. Nomura and Nikko, another securities firm, admitted last year lending Ishii large sums for the same purpose. The prosecutor said the gangster gave Mr Watanabe Y1.7 billion in profits from this speculation.
The prosecutor also shed light on how Mr Watanabe developed his political contacts. Here the link man is said to have been Rekiji Kobari, the 78-year-old chairman of a bus firm called Fukushima Kotsu. Mr Kobari, who was questioned by prosecutors in July in a Tokyo hospital to which he had retreated, has connections with the Liberal Democrats. He is reckoned to have been the main conduit in Mr Watanabe's efforts to buy friends in Nagatacho, Tokyo's political district.
There is an even murkier aspect of the Sagawa Kyubin case which the mainstream press in Japan chooses not to discuss. It was raised in the latest issue of Zaikai Tembo, a financial magazine, which disappeared suddenly from news-stands a few weeks ago. An article placed Sagawa Kyubin within a group of nationalists and gangsters active in China before and during the second world war. Many of the people active in this group subsequently rose to prominence after the war when the Americans decided it was sensible to put nationalists in power to counter left-wing influence. The most prominent beneficiary was Nobusuke Kishi. He had been accused of war crimes, but the American administration that ran post-war Japan cancelled the charge, believing that Kishi would be useful. He became prime minister in 1957. Kishi was head of the Seiwakai faction, which was later led by his adopted son, Shintaro Abe, a former foreign minister, who died last year.
The old Japan-China connection is traditionally viewed as hands-off material by Japanese journalists, which is one reason the Sagawa Kyubin affair remains so murky. One point is clear, though. The political power base of the present prime minister, Kiichi Miyazawa, depends on the support of the increasingly troubled Takeshita faction. The doubts around Mr Kanemaru is bound to make it harder for Mr Miyazawa to get his way in parliament, especially when it comes to passing measures to reform an electoral system that breeds corruption.","There are those who predict that Japan 's latest scandal , involving a parcel - delivery firm called Sagawa Kyubin , will fade from public view because it is so boring .

The most powerful figure in Japanese politics, Shin Kanemaru, 78, was notified politely by post on September 28th that his acceptance of a Y500m ($4.2m) donation from the Sagawa Kyubin delivery firm was a breach of the law. Japanese politicians are not supposed to accept more than Y1.5m from any one source during a single year.
Unlike lesser transgressors, however, Mr Kanemaru had neither to visit the public prosecutor's office to answer embarrassing questions nor turn up in court. The summary indictment merely asked him to pay a fine of Y200,000--about the same as the penalty for overnight parking in some parts of Tokyo. Such is the influence of the ruling party's godfather.
Mr Kanemaru had remained closeted in his Tokyo home since August 27th, when he resigned as vice-president of the ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) after admitting that he had known about the illegal Y500m contribution. If indicted, Mr Kanemaru had promised to resign also from his real job--running the 111-strong LDP faction that was originally formed by the former prime minister, Noboru Takeshita. It was even rumoured that he would leave politics altogether.
That was enough to frighten the government, and especially the prime minister. Kiichi Miyazawa got his job on Mr Kanemaru's say-so and has kept it only through the Takeshita faction's support. Were Mr Kanemaru really to shuffle away, the Takeshita faction would fall apart. There would be an unseemly battle as his political heir, Ichiro Ozawa, the up-and-coming Seiroku Kajiyama and Mr Takeshita himself fought for control of the faction. Mr Takeshita resigned as prime minister over the Recruit shares-for-favours scandal, but has not given up hope of a second term. To get it, however, he would first have to regain control of his faction.
But not all resignation threats are real. No sooner had Mr Kanemaru threatened to resign than his protete, Mr Ozawa, was offering to go too. Mr Kajiyama and Mr Takeshita got the message. If Mr Kanemaru and Mr Ozawa really did go, neither Mr Kajiyama nor Mr Takeshita would win the faction's whole-hearted support, and they knew it. Both are now declaring that, come what may, there must be no change in the Takeshita faction's leadership. Mr Kanemaru finally returned to his office on October 1st, doubtless to the prime minister's great relief.
But Mr Miyazawa's difficulties are not over. Two particular problems are looming. One is the extraordinary session of the Diet (parliament) that is to be convened on October 30th. The Y10.7 trillion supplementary budget that the government has promised to revive the ailing economy needs to be passed by no later than early November if it is to have any effect this fiscal year.
However, the opposition parties intend to use the budget debates to raise Cain over the relationship between politicians and angsters revealed by the Sagawa Kyubin scandal. Some opposition members are even talking about compelling Mr Kanemaru to give evidence as a sworn witness before the house, as the former prime minister, Yasuhiro Nakasone, was forced to during the Recruit affair. They will probably fail but, even so, the coming month will be a trying time for Mr Miyazawa.
All the more so because a cabinet reshuffle is due. Normally, this would present few problems other than damaged egos. But with the rumpus within the Takeshita faction barely abated, it becomes more tricky. The biggest dilemma is who to make secretary-general. The post belongs to the Takeshita faction. The group's 50-year-old Mr Ozawa has done the job before and, though still recovering from a heart attack, wants to do it in the year ahead.

The 78-year-old godfather of the ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) was fined a token Y200,000 ($1,700) in late September for receiving Y500m from the scandal-plagued Sagawa Kyubin delivery firm. It is illegal for politicians to receive donations of more than Y1.5m from any one source during a single year. ""It is not enough to demand that Mr Kaneman should testify before the Diet (parliament) and resign. We must also uncover the hidden donations to LDP politicians:' said Makoto Tanabe, chairman of the Social Democratic Party. Rich, that, coming from a man who is both one of Mr Kanemaru's oldest sparring partners and a fellow conspirator.
The real intention is to embarrass the LDP into being more generous with its under-the-table handouts when the extraordinary session of the Diet gets under way in late October. After all, Mr Kanemaru does not intend to get out of politics until he is good and ready, perhaps in early 1994. Meanwhile, although he has given up his post as party vice-president, he continues his proper job: running the 111-strong faction set up by the former prime minister, Nobon Takeshita. This faction picks the plum jobs in the cabinet.
Yet appearances matter, and the government will still have to introduce a measure of political reform during the extraordinary Diet session. Otherwise its supplementary budget--of Y10.7 trillion, in measures to revive the economy--could be held hostage by the opposition.
Three concessions are therefore being prepared. The first is a change in constituency boundaries. This is needed anyway--the disparity between the value of a vote in the most and the least populous electoral districts now exceeds three to one. Without a change the next general election could be declared unconstitutional and therefore void. The government is proposing to add one new seat in nine districts and remove one from each often others. The ""nine-plus-ten-minus"" proposal is expected to go down well if the LDP secures the odd marginal seat for the opposition. Such deals are what Mr Kanemaru and Mr Tanabe tend to discuss when they dine together.
The second possible concession is an amendment to the law controlling political funds. Instead of simply paying the maximum fine of just Y200,000 (the sum Mr Kanemaru had to pay), politicians caught receiving too much money would have the donation confiscated.
The final gesture could be electoral reform. Shortly after being made prime minister last November, Kiichi Miyazawa dutifully ditched his predecessor's proposal to replace Japan's multi-seat constituencies with a combination of single-member, first-past-the-post constituencies and seats chosen by proportional representation.
The single-seat proposal held clear dangers for the opposition parties. Traditionally, LDP candidates slug it out among themselves for three of the four or five seats in a constituency, allowing an opposition candidate to claim the remaining seat unopposed. Fighting an election this way has been ruinously expensive for the ruling party, but has cost the opposition parties practically nothing.
The biggest objection, however, came from LDP members who had already served several parliamentary terms. Having spent fortunes nurturing their local supporters, they were appalled at the thought of having to fight an election on an equal footing with newcomers and members of the opposition. Paradoxically, that reaction has persuaded the opposition parties of the charms of the single-seat proposal.
The LDP'S new set of reforms will broadly be the same as before. True, party diehards are still trying to jettison the idea of proportional representation. But Mr Kanemaru and his henchman, Ichiro Ozawa, know that no opposition politicians are going to accept the deal without the one thing that will save them from being cut to pieces in a first-past-the-post election. Odd, really, that the LDP'S most enthusiastic advocates of electoral reform these days seem to be those with the grubbiest hands.","Opposition parties in Japan have been making ritual demands -- not too loudly , of course , in case they be taken seriously -- for Shin Kanemaru to get out of politics .

After all , Mr Kanemaru does not intend to get out of politics until he is good and ready , perhaps in early 1994 . Meanwhile , although he has given up his post as party vice - president , he continues his proper job : running the 111 - strong faction set up by the former prime minister , Nobon Takeshita . This faction picks the plum jobs in the cabinet . 
 Yet appearances matter , and the government will still have to introduce a measure of political reform during the extraordinary Diet session . Otherwise its supplementary budget -- of Y10.7 trillion , in measures to revive the economy -- could be held hostage by the opposition . 
 Three concessions are therefore being prepared . The first is a change in constituency boundaries . This is needed anyway -- the disparity between the value of a vote in the most and the least populous electoral districts now exceeds three to one . Without a change the next general election could be declared unconstitutional and therefore void . The government is proposing to add one new seat in nine districts and remove one from each often others . The "" nine - plus - ten - minus "" proposal is expected to go down well if the LDP secures the odd marginal seat for the opposition . Such deals are what Mr Kanemaru and Mr Tanabe tend to discuss when they dine together . 
 The second possible concession is an amendment to the law controlling political funds . Instead of simply paying the maximum fine of just Y200,000 ( the sum Mr Kanemaru had to pay ) , politicians caught receiving too much money would have the donation confiscated . 
 The final gesture could be electoral reform . Shortly after being made prime minister last November , Kiichi Miyazawa dutifully ditched Kiichi Miyazawa's predecessor 's proposal to replace Japan 's multi - seat constituencies with a combination of single - member , first - past - the - post constituencies and seats chosen by proportional representation . 
 The single - seat proposal held clear dangers for the opposition parties . Traditionally , LDP candidates slug it out among themselves for three of the four or five seats in a constituency , allowing an opposition candidate to claim the remaining seat unopposed . Fighting an election this way has been ruinously expensive for the ruling party , but has cost the opposition parties practically nothing . 
 The biggest objection , however , came from LDP members who had already served several parliamentary terms . Having spent fortunes nurturing their local supporters , they were appalled at the thought of having to fight an election on an equal footing with newcomers and members of the opposition . Paradoxically , that reaction has persuaded the opposition parties of the charms of the single - seat proposal . 
 The LDP 'S new set of reforms will broadly be the same as before . True , party diehards are still trying to jettison the idea of proportional representation . But Mr Kanemaru and his henchman , Ichiro Ozawa , know that no opposition politicians are going to accept the deal without the one thing that will save them from being cut to pieces in a first - past - the - post election . Odd , really , that the LDP 'S most enthusiastic advocates of electoral reform these days seem to be those with the grubbiest hands .",740,Japan,A29-8185,IN TERM,True,Kiichi Miyazawa,2,True

The authorities in Beijing have even reintroduced the ancient Chinese custom of chaogong--demanding that emissaries from neighbouring countries come to China to pay homage. On October 23rd the Japanese royal couple, Emperor Akihito and Empress Michiko, will make an official six-day trip to Beijing, Shanghai and the ancient capital of Xian. It will be the first time in two millennia that a Japanese emperor has made the pilgrimage to the Middle Kingdom.
Ostensibly, the royal visit is to celebrate the 20th anniversary of the normalisation of relations between the two countries. But China has been pressing for Emperor Akihito's visit as a seal of approval on its post-Tiananmen policies. The Chinese government has also wanted to warn the Americans that it will feel obliged to play the ""Japan card"" if they choose to treat China as a pariah.
Japan feels that it has to do something about the country's widening trade gap with China. Japan is China's second-largest trading partner after Hong Kong. It exported goods worth $8.6 billion to China last year but imported $14.2 billions-worth in return. Less successfully than America, Japan has been urging China to rectify its ""unfair"" trading practices if it wants its bid to join GATT to be taken seriously. Japan also hopes to be a moderating influence on China now that it is flexing its muscles and Russia and America are reducing their military presence in the region. By lifting sanctions one year after the Tiananmen massacre and granting China huge amounts of technical and financial aid, the Japanese authorities argue that they have done much to prevent China from slipping into isolation.
Even so, Kiichi Miyazawa's government has had misgivings about letting Emperor Akihito go to Beijing. It has been nervous about the possibility of ""spontaneous"" demonstrations while the emperor was on tour--with apologies and compensation being demanded for the enforced prostitution suffered by many Chinese women as well as the imperial army's slaughter of Chinese civilians in the 1930s. Some 13m Chinese are reckoned to have lost their lives during Japan's occupation of China.
To et its way, China has been using both stick and carrot. In February it threatened to use gunboats to enforce its sovereignty over the Diaoyutai islands, off Taiwan, which Japan calls Senkaku and claims as its own. Meanwhile, unlike other Asian countries with bitter wartime memories, China has declined to criticise Japan's recent decision to send troops to Cambodia as peacekeepers for the United Nations.
The Chinese government. has also refused pointedly to endorse claims by some 300,000 private citizens in China for compensation from Japan for wartime atrocities. Most important of all, the Chinese have done nothing to discourage Japan in its campaign to win permanent membership of the UN Security Council.
The Japanese authorities finally caved in over the royal visit when the Chinese assured them in September that there would be no demonstrations, nor would the emperor be expected to apologise for Japan's colonial past. In his formal address, Emperor Akihito is now expected merely to refer to ""wartime abuses"" but will stop short of issuing the kind of apology he made when Roh Tae Woo, the South Korean president, visited Japan in 1990.
Lately, the police in Beijing and Shanghai have taken to silencing potential trouble-makers with short spells of detention. Japanese police have their own way of silencing critics of the emperor's forthcoming trip--especially the nationalists who make so much noise. A new ordinance went into effect in Tokyo in mid-October, restricting the amount of noise that the right-wing gangs' loudspeaker vans can make.","With the Tiananmen Square massacre of 1989 buried by the promise of trade , China has felt confident enough to start throwing its diplomatic weight around Asia again .

But in the end Shin Kanemaru, the greatest wheeler-dealer in Japanese politics, failed to make a deal for himself. After a week of mounting criticism, the Liberal Democratic Pay's embattled kingmaker finally announced on October 14th that he was resigning his seat in the Diet (parliament) to take responsibility for the Sagawa Kyubin scandal that was threatening to bring parliamentary affairs to a halt.
It may yet. What angered the public was not the gory details unearthed during the Sagawa investigation of how gangsters helped to get Mr Kanemaru's man, Noboru Takeshita, elected as prime minister in 1987. Still less was it the Y500m ($4.2m) in illegal donations that Mr Kanemaru took from the Sagawa delivery firm before the 1991 general election on behalf of 60 younger Liberal Democratic parliamentarians who belonged to the Takeshita faction that he managed. Japanese politicians are not allowed to receive more than 1.5m from any one source in a year.
What stuck in the public's craw was the way Mr Kanemaru seemed able to fix even the public prosecutor's office. Instead of being hauled in for questioning, Mr Kanemaru was allowed simply to write a letter admitting he had erred. He did not even have to attend court. A summons was sent by post, requiring him merely to pay a 200,000 ($1,670)-fine--less than the penalty for some traffic offences. The bitter truth was made plain: one law for the rich and powerful and one for the rest.
Mr Kanemaru had hoped to ride out the storm of protest by merely standing down from his ceremonial post of vice-president of the party and retreating even more than usual into the shadows. The 78-year-old leader was determined to soldier on, especially once it became clear that, if he went, Mr Takeshita would then be under the spotlight. Mr Kanemaru was also reluctant to leave his post as boss of the ruling party's biggest faction without first ensuring the smooth handover of power to his young protg, Ichiro Ozawa. Mr Kanemaru and Mr Ozawa have wielded the big stick and done deals with the opposition, as well as with the other Liberal Democratic factions. Without them, even less than normal would get done in Japanese politics.
The influence of Mr Ozawa could now begin to wane. He has been acting chairman of the 111-member Takeshita faction and in line to be the next-but-one prime minister. In a bid to still criticism about his high-handedness, Mr Ozawa is now having to share power with Ryutaro Hashimoto, a former finance minister, and Keizo Obuchi, a former secretary-general of the Liberal Democrats. Some expect Mr Ozawa to resign his party post, if not his Diet seat, to atone for not protecting his boss better. If he goes, the Takeshita faction is likely to fracture into two groups, with one following Mr Ozawa and the other choosing the up-and-coming Seiroku Kajiyama as its leader.
That could be more than a little embarrassing for the government. Kiichi Miyazawa got the job of prime minister a year ago an Mr Kanemaru's nod and has remained in office only through the Takeshita faction's support. The prime minister's own faction has nothing like enough clout to get legislation passed in the Diet. Deals requiring bundles of under-the-table money have to be done with the opposition to get bills through the upper house, where the ruling party no longer has an overall majority. Its majority remains intact in the more powerful lower house.
The most serious piece of parliamentary business that could be held up by quarrels within the Takeshita faction is the supplementary budget. This is needed for the government's Y10.7 trillion ($89 billion) pack of measures to help revive the economy. An extraordinary session of the Diet is to be convened on October 30th to consider the package. It looks as though the opposition parties will stall the budget debate while demanding that Mr Kanemaru, and possibly Mr Takeshita, give evidence before the house under oath.

Yet while the prime minister, Kiichi Miyazawa, was rejecting efforts to open Japan's heavily protected rice market, the makers of miso paste, sake and rice crackers were threatening to put up prices because of the shortage of rice. The food manufacturers are expecting only 60% of the rice for processing that they had been promised. The extra 200,000 tons will have to be made up with table rice costing twice as much.
Japan is still in a tizzy about whether to accept GATT proposals for converting its import restrictions on rice into tariffs, thereby allowing foreign rice to gain a foothold in Japan. Now that America and the European Community (France permitting) have settled their differences over oil seeds, the government is panicking about being blamed should its rice ban cause further delays in bringing the six-year Uruguay round to a weary conclusion.
The Miyazawa government knows that sooner or later it is going to have to lift its ban on rice imports. Yet it has done nothing to prepare public opinion for the inevitable. Over the coming weeks ""tariffication"" will have to be sold to voters throughout the country's farming constituencies. But Mr Miyazawa and half his cabinet are continuing to resist the idea loudly, painting themselves and the country further into a corner.
Two realists in the cabinet have been Kozo Watanabe, the international trade and industry minister, and his namesake, Michio Watanabe, the foreign minister. Both have been urging Mr Miyazawa to make concessions. The trade minister has been particularly scathing about the government's lack of preparation. ""What is needed"", he told reporters after a cabinet meeting on November 24th, ""is politics that finally uses some brains ... The prime minister should take a political decision.""
Such decisions have been difficult since the ruling Liberal Democratic Party fell into disarray after the resignation of its powerbroker, Shin Kanemaru, over the Sagawa Kyubin scandal. Mr Miyazawa relied on the large Takeshita faction, headed by Mr Kanemaru, to get things done. Now the faction is disintegrating as rivals battle to lead it. Earlier it had been assumed that Mr Kanemaru and his henchmen would do backdoor deals to sell rice liberalisation to the farmers, as happened when the Japanese beef and citrus markets had to be opened to imports in 1988. But with Mr Kanemaru out of politics (and in hospital for an eye operation) there is no one to see that things get done.
In his absence, the government's public line is that the deal struck by the Americans and the Europeans is tantamount to a ""revision"" of the draft proposals made last December by GATT'S director-general, Arthur Dunkel. That, it is argued, sets a precedent for other amendments. Mr Miyazawa wants the Dunkel proposals revised to exclude rice from tariffication. He can expect support from South Korea, which also has some vociferous rice growers. But not even Mr Miyazawa expects his GATT partners to make an exception over rice--certainly not with Japan's trade surplus soaring again.
So behind the scenes Japanese officials are preparing to negotiate. They know that accepting imports and tariffs is better than having to deal with the Americans direct, especially with a Clinton administration likely to be more protectionist than its two predecessors.
To start the bargaining Japan will offer to lift its ban on rice imports providing the tariff on rice can be prohibitively high. It costs about three times as much to produce rice in Japan as it does, on average, elsewhere. Mr Dunkel suggests that the tariff should be based on this price difference. But the government makes Japanese consumers pay about seven times the world price for the rice they buy for the table. With a tariff set to keep prices at that level, there would be few complaints from the ruling party's 3m faithful in the paddies. So what if a handful of sake, miso and rice-cracker makers, deprived of cheap imports, scream blue murder?

But now the Takeshita faction's era of power is ending. The 109-member group within the ruling Liberal Democratic Party is splintering amid allegations that gangsters were used to get Noboru Takeshita elected as Japan's prime minister in 1987. Mr Takeshita may now have to follow the faction's disgraced boss, Shin Kanemaru, into retirement. One way or another, Kiichi Miyazawa, the prime minister, is finally being freed of the Takeshita faction's grip.
The annual ritual of selecting a new cabinet was being completed this week, and the new line-up was expected to be announced on December 11th. For the first time since it was formed by Kakuei Tanaka in the early 1970s, the faction's members will not dominate both the government and the party machine.
But Mr Miyazawa will have to pay a price for his new freedom. He has been allowed to stay in power only because of support from the Takeshita faction. Now he must forge a fresh set of alliances.
In creating his new cabinet he was having to offer plum posts to members of what were until recently lesser factions. But he was also trying to maintain cordial relations with as many people as possible in the old Takeshita faction. The juiciest plum is not a cabinet portfolio but the post of secretary-general of the Liberal Democrats--a job which usually involves running the government on a day-to-day basis.
Mr Miyazawa was expected to give the post to Seiroku Kajiyama, a senior member of the old Takeshita faction. Mr Kajiyama believes he has earned the job, having bullied the opposition into accepting most of the government's proposals, including the bill to allow Japanese troops to join United Nations peacekeeping missions abroad. But Mr Kajiyama's chances of getting the top job owed more to the fact that, with him in the team, the largest chunk of the Takeshita faction would support Mr Miyazawa.
In October Mr Kajiyama fought a bare-knuckled fight with Ochiro Ozawa to stop him becoming head of the Takeshita faction. Instead, the job went to Keizo Obuchi, whom Mr Kajiyama supported. Although the faction is now splitting, Mr Kajiyama remains the power behind a group of 60-odd Takeshita faction members, headed by Mr Obuchi. As for Mr Ozawa, he has rounded up about 40 younger members of the faction, forming a group called ""Reform Forum 21"" under the nominal leadership of Tsutomu Hata, the finance minister before the reshuffle. When the two groups formalise their split, the Obuchi faction will rank fourth among the Liberal Democrats' groups and the Hata faction fifth.
Under the new order, power brokers in the ruling party's three larger groupings are determined to get more of the good jobs they have been deprived of for so long. Hiroshi Mitsuzuka, who heads what is in effect now the party's largest faction, has been badgering the prime minister for one of the other top party posts--chairman of the powerful Executive Council. He also wants his lieutenant, Yoshiro Mori, made finance minister, a post that has traditionally gone to the Takeshita faction. The Mitsuzuka faction looked like securing at least four senior posts in the new cabinet.
Michio Watanabe also wanted the secretary-general's job, but has been persuaded to stay on as foreign minister and deputy prime minister. The understanding is that, if his health holds up, the prime ministership will be his for the asking when Mr Miyazawa's two-year term is up next September. A Watanabe man was expected to get the third of the top party posts--chairman of the Policy Affairs Council. The justice ministry, which has for long been a property of the Takeshita faction, was expected to go to Hyosuke Kujiraoka, of the small but honest Komoto faction.
While mulling over his new cabinet this week, Mr Miyazawa has no doubt been digesting the results of two opinion polls. One survey rated his present cabinet's performance as abysmal, with only one in seven of those polled prepared to give it support. In the other survey, three out of five people declared themselves delighted that the Takeshita faction was disintegrating. That ought surely to give Mr Miyazawa the confidence to select a more independent cabinet--and, in the process, to be a little more his own man.","For two decades it dominated Japanese politics , picking the nation 's prime ministers and keeping the plum cabinet and party posts for itself .

Although the faction is now splitting , Mr Kajiyama remains the power behind a group of 60 - odd Takeshita faction members , headed by Mr Obuchi . As for Mr Ozawa , he has rounded up about 40 younger members of the faction , forming a group called "" Reform Forum 21 "" under the nominal leadership of Tsutomu Hata , the finance minister before the reshuffle . When the two groups formalise their split , the Obuchi faction will rank fourth among the Liberal Democrats ' groups and the Hata faction fifth . 
 Under the new order , power brokers in the ruling party 's three larger groupings are determined to get more of the good jobs they have been deprived of for so long . Hiroshi Mitsuzuka , who heads what is in effect now the party 's largest faction , has been badgering Kiichi Miyazawa for one of the other top party posts -- chairman of the powerful Executive Council . He also wants his lieutenant , Yoshiro Mori , made finance minister , a post that has traditionally gone to the Takeshita faction . The Mitsuzuka faction looked like securing at least four senior posts in the new cabinet . 
 Michio Watanabe also wanted the secretary - general 's job , but has been persuaded to stay on as foreign minister and deputy prime minister . The understanding is that , if his health holds up , the prime ministership will be his for the asking when Kiichi Miyazawa's two - year term is up next September . A Watanabe man was expected to get the third of the top party posts -- chairman of the Policy Affairs Council . The justice ministry , which has for long been a property of the Takeshita faction , was expected to go to Hyosuke Kujiraoka , of the small but honest Komoto faction . 
 While mulling over Kiichi Miyazawa's new cabinet this week , Kiichi Miyazawa has no doubt been digesting the results of two opinion polls . One survey rated Kiichi Miyazawa's present cabinet 's performance as abysmal , with only one in seven of those polled prepared to give it support . In the other survey , three out of five people declared themselves delighted that the Takeshita faction was disintegrating . That ought surely to give Kiichi Miyazawa the confidence to select a more independent cabinet -- and , in the process , to be a little more Kiichi Miyazawa's own man .",740,Japan,A29-8185,IN TERM,True,"Kiichi Miyazawa , the prime minister ,",17,True

Japan's diplomats like to shudder at the thought. Japan, they say, would not dream of challenging America's supremacy in East Asia; indeed, it is proud to contribute to regional security by having America's soldiers on its soil. But perhaps they shudder too much. As Japan's prime minister, Kiichi Miyazawa, begins a visit to South-East Asia on January 11th, it is hard not to see a touch of independent ambition. The real question is not so much whether Japan wants to lead in Asia, but whether it can.
The urge to lead starts with economics. Partly because Americans get angry when they buy too many Japanese products, Japanese exporters have tilted towards Asia. In 1991 Japan's exports to the Association of South-East Asian Nations (Singapore, Thailand, Malaysia, Indonesia, the Philippines and Brunei) plus Hong Kong, Taiwan and South Korea were three times their 1985 value (measured in nominal dollars); exports to America grew by just two-fifths in that period. Investment has also flowed increasingly to Asia. To escape the rising yen, Japanese firms have moved their factories abroad. Between 1985 and 1991 they quadrupled the flow of investment into the Asian group; flows to America tripled.
This gives Japan a big stake in a region not noted for its inherent stability. Thailand is prone to coups. Indonesia's unity depends on an authoritarian central government. Cambodia is struggling to put behind it years of civil war. Last year China scared its neighbours by pressing its claim to the contested Spratly islands. Vietnam, For all its recent rapprochement with the regime in Beijing, fundamentally mistrusts China. That antagonism could well surface again when Vietnam eventually joins ASEAN. Meanwhile, North Korea, Japan's Stalinist neighbour, is friendless, penniless and dangerously close to having nuclear weapons.
Not surprisingly, Japan would dearly love the Americans to keep the lid on this cauldron. But whereas Bill Clinton has promised not to withdraw troops from Asia, the Japanese cannot help but wonder whether he--or perhaps the president after him--will stick to this commitment. They note that last September America, under pressure to go, closed its naval base at Subic Bay in the Philippines. And they gulp at America's budget deficit. Even in the current economic climate, Japan's bureaucrats hate the idea of any sort of deficit. Many do not believe that a broke America will underpin Asian security indefinitely.
Like West Europeans in the 1980s, Japan therefore wants to prepare for a gradual American withdrawal without thereby encouraging it. To manage this trick, Japan aims to strengthen its hand in Asia and then use its clout to further America's interests. The clout-building takes the form of a growing aid budget: for all its fiscal discipline, Japan aims to spend 6.5% more on aid in the financial year beginning in April. Cautiously, Japan is raising its military profile, too. Last year Japanese troops were sent to help the UN in Cambodia, their first foreign deployment since the second world war. Now Michio Watanabe, Japan's foreign minister, talks of building on that start.
Japan has already used its expanding Asian influence to assist the Americans. It has refused to join the East Asian Economic Caucus, a club invented by Malaysia that has an anti-western tone. Instead, it has thrown its weight behind the Asia-Pacific Economic Co-operation forum; thanks in part to Japanese insistence, this group includes America. Japan is also keen on the Asian Development Bank; it and America are the bank's biggest backers.
On this month's trip--he will visit Indonesia, Malaysia, Thailand and Brunei--Mr Miyazawa will no doubt urge his hosts to be nice to the Americans. In public, the emphasis will be different. The prime minister likes to tell fellow-Asians that their interests will be uppermost in his mind when Japan holds the G7 summit this summer. He also wants partners for Japanese aid projects in the region: Japan provides the money, somebody else provides the people. This way Japan makes friends--and the more it makes, the more useful it is to America.
That, at least, is how the Japanese tell it. Yet as Japan's influence and investment in Asia expand, so it will be more inclined to pursue its own policies. In 1990 it defied America by resuming aid to China just a year after the Tiananmen massacre. Late last year it broke with America's embargo on aid to Vietnam. For the sake of another national aim--to recover from Russia control of the northern Kurile islands--Japan has also resisted American pressure to be more generous to President Yeltsin's government.
Such shows of independence serve Japan's self-esteem as well as its self-interest. The country is stung by the charge (raised most loudly when it dithered during the Gulf war) that it is incapable of acting on its own initiative. It wants to show itself deserving of a permanent seat on the United Nations Security Council, and Asia seems the natural place to make its claim.
The trouble is that Japan's diplomatic achievements are tending to fall short of its ambitions. Japan thought it could use its aid lever to prise the Kurile islands from Russia. This failed even when Russia was happily shedding other bits of the ex-Soviet Union, and when the Japanese tried again in mid-1992 Boris Yeltsin snubbed them just as Mikhail Gorbachev had.
Two other embarrassments followed. Japan's war-time brutality returned to haunt it: Korean women, once forced into prostitution to serve Japanese troops, have recently demanded compensation from the Japanese government. The Japanese responded badly, first denying that forced prostitution happened; then denying official involvement in it. The government has now formally apologised, but the repeated calls for compensation keep the issue in the headlines.
As if this were not enough, the UN's Cambodia operation, intended to be a show-case of Japan's policy of constructive internationalism, is now looking distinctly rickety. A body bag or two would be sure to make Japan's cautious leaders pause over their Asian ambitions.","An independent foreign policy ? Japan 's diplomats like to shudder at the thought .

But Japan's prime minister, Kiichi Miyazawa, may yet get back on top. The prospect of a royal wedding in June has softened the memory of last year's Sagawa Kyubin scandal. The G7 summit of rich countries' leaders in Tokyo in July will make Mr Miyazawa look statesmanlike. By the time autumn comes, the ruling Liberal Democrats may well choose him to lead the party in an election for the important lower house of the Diet (parliament). That would ive Mr Miyazawa a third year in the job, a fair distinction in Japanese politics.
Mr Miyazawa's chief worry ought to be the Sagwa Kyubin scandal. So far only one senior party man has resigned after admitting to receiving bribes from the parcel-delivery firm, although others at the top are implicated. The opposition Social Democratic Party may seek more confessions and resignations in the new session of the Diet starting on January 22nd. But many Japanese believe it would be tasteless to keep on about the scandal just when Japan is celebrating the crown prince's engagement. Instead, a different theme is deemed becoming: reforming the political system, in; including the constitution. The end of the cold war, a young president in America, a career woman preparing to marry into the royal family: all encourage the Japanese to feel that the world is changing, and that their political system should change with it. Conceivably, though, this talk of renewal may prove more awkward for Mr Miyazawa than the Sagawa Kyubin scandal. This septuagenarian stands for the old order.
The reformists' favourite target is the part of Japan's constitution that forbids the use of military force abroad. Last year the government rammed a law through the Diet allowing Japanese soldiers to join the United Nations' operation in Cambodia. Under the law, soldiers may only be sent to a country where there is a ceasefire, and where they have been invited by the country's government. It would not apply to, say, Somalia. Japan's internationalists sense there are more Somalias to come.
Mr Miyazawa is against changing the constitution. In Bangkok on January 16th, he said Japan ""shall never again become a military power"". Michio Watanabe, the foreign minister, who wants fewer restrictions on Japanese soldiers abroad, may hope that, by isolating the prime minister on the issue of the constitution, he will improve his own chances of leading the party. An opinion poll on January 17th said that 69% of Japanese believe that helping to maintain peace is an important part of Japan's contribution to international affairs.

Now some party insiders too show signs of impatience. On January 25th two senior members of Reform Forum 21, an LDP faction formed in December, said they might leave to start a new party. This faction controls 35 seats in the lower (and more powerful) house of the Diet (parliament). If the LDP lost those seats, it would also lose its overall majority.
Japan's politics often seems unchanging, so there is doubt whether the secession talk is serious. But Ichiro Ozawa, the more prominent of the two trouble-makers, is not to be dismissed lightly. Though only 50, he has already held the powerful job of LDP secretary-general. He is often spoken of as a future prime minister.
Secession, says Mr Ozawa, need not be necessary if the party reforms Japan's politics. This means shaking up the multi-member constituency system, which causes people from the same party to compete against each other in elections. As a result, candidates cannot canvass votes by preaching party policy; they are obliged to compete on character, and on the gifts they give to voters. An electoral system closer either to Britain's or to Germany's, Mr Ozawa thinks, would encourage more debate.
Plenty of LDP men say change is a fine idea; and on January 22nd the prime minister, Kiichi Miyazawa, promised to do something about political reform. But the truth is that politicians fear change in the system that elected them. Many reckon Mr Miyazawa would like his reform proposal to fail. In that case, Mr Ozawa might just put his threat into practice.
Mr Ozawa claims lofty motives. Japan, he says, can no longer rely entirely on America to secure peace and free trade; indeed, the Japanese fear that the Clinton administration may prove to be protectionist. But Japan will not perform confidently in the world until its electoral system encourages debate and, consequently, the formation of bold policies. Mr Ozawa despises Japan's tradition of political consensus. He is not afraid to describe a senior party colleague as ""stupid"". In Mr Ozawa's view, important political decisions should no longer be made by faction bosses in sake-filled rooms. They should be arrived at by public discussion.
Mr Ozawa sits straight and talks formally. The second trouble-maker, Kazuo Aichi, smiles and slouches; his office wall is cheered up by a T-shirt depicting Japan's favourite symbol of change, Bill Clinton. Mr Aichi advances a more simple reason for threatening secession. After chatting to people in his constituency over the recent holidays, he has decided that leaving the party could win him votes. Because of the Sagawa Kyubin affair, the latest in a string of corruption scandals, membership of the ruling party has become a liability.
This will remain true only if, as the lower-house election approaches towards the end of the year, the LDP is seen to be in danger of losing its majority. An opinion poll this month said the government is slightly less unpopular: 57% said they disapproved of it, compared with 65% in December. Traditionally, most people have backed the LDP because it held power, and therefore could funnel favours to supporters. Mr Aichi is undaunted. Leaving the party would not mean losing power, he says: by teaming up with other opposition groups, the new party could force the Liberal Democrats to form a coalition government.
The rebels are likely to bide their time. Electoral reform would end talk of a split. But if secession talk does encourage electoral reform, it will have achieved a result more significant than the formation of a new party.","The Japanese are fed up with the Liberal Democratic Party , which has ruled them continuously since 1955 .

Mr Clinton means change; Japan's politics is famously unchanging. Mr Clinton is celebrated on Japanese chat shows; few American televiewers could name the prime minister of Japan, or any other Japanese person for that matter.
The contrasts hurt. Japan's remarkable economic success has not brought a corresponding self-confidence. Its people envy Mr Clinton's vigour, yet are afraid to copy it. In short, Japan has a Clinton complex.
Nowhere is this more evident than on the vexed question of initiative. Mr Clinton was elected as the man with a plan, though Americans are starting to ask when he will implement any of it. Japan's politicians err in the opposite way: they shrink from spelling out their goals, even on occasions when they are doing something novel. An education system that stresses rote learning rather than argument, a career system that rewards seniority rather than precocious merit: both discourage the individualism and self-promotion that help make America. So reluctant are Japan's leaders to take the initiative that sometimes nothing seems to happen without foreign prompting.
The present debate on Japan's lacklustre economy is a case in point. When the Bank of Japan cuts interest rates, as it did on February 4th, lowering the discount rate from 3.25% to 2.5%, or when the finance ministry concedes a fiscal stimulus, many conclude that outsiders have prevailed upon Japan to rein in its trade surplus. If Japan stops penalising its consumers by protecting its rice market, foreigners will again be given the credit.
The same eminence blache lurks behind many lesser decisions. Last month an American gained the highest rank in sumo wrestling; perhaps he should thank the American protests last year when a compatriot was denied similar promotion. An imperial wedding was announced early, because a foreign newspaper had decided to report it.
Japan might fairly shrug off comparisons with reigners. After all, its economic management has been sounder than America's. Its sportsmen do not take drugs. Its imperial family is free of divorces. Takashi Inogouchi, a professor at Tokyo University, argues that Japan is often quicker than America to implement change, but is slower to discuss it. In 1985 Japan submitted to American pressure and agreed to double domestic demand; America, for its part, said it would tackle its budget deficit. By 1990 Japan had made good its side of the bargain. America had not.
Yet most Japanese are remarkably uncheered by such evidence. They feel unglamorous. They are hurt by foreigners taunts: that they live in rabbit hutches and are economic animals, and that their constitutional restrictions on sending troops to fight abroad are a form of cowardly introversion. Japanese journalists often reveal the national paranoia by reporting on what Tokyo-based foreigners are reporting.
Mr Clinton is increasing the Paranoia, partly because of his fresh-laced energy and partly because of the team around him. Winston Lord, the man he has nominated to take charge of Asia at the State Department, is a China expert. The same goes for Kent Wiedemann, the nominee for Asia in the National Security Council. The top trade negotiator, Mickey Kantor, has no experience in trade. True, Laura Tyson the head of the Council of Economic Advisers, does know about Japan, but her views are not encouraging. She believes in tough action to prise open ""structural"" barriers protecting Japan's market. Japanese firms collude to exclude outsiders, she thinks, so America must do more than encourage Japan to lift tariffs.
There will probably be more hard talk, because Japan's trade surplus is soaring. Until recently the Japanese soothingly pointed out that, despite the rise in their worldwide surplus, their surplus with America was not growing. On January 22nd, however, Decembers trade figures were published, showing that the surplus with America was up 14.3% on the previous year. As America's economy takes off, it will suck in still more imports. Five days later, when America imposed steel duties on 19 countries, Japan's pessimists sensed the first shock of the coming trade war.
In fact Japan's steel exporters were less heavily penalised than European ones; and the duties resulted from a complaint lodged with America's Commerce apartment by the steel producers last June. In other areas, too, Japan's nervousness over the new administration may be overdone. The Japanese fret that their prime minister, Kiichi Miyazawa, has failed to secure an early audience with Mr Clinton. But then Mr Clinton wants desperately not to be a foreign-policy president. The Japanese concern that America will pull back from Asia may be similarly exaggerated; the only withdrawal so far has been an unwilling departure from the Philippines' Subic Bay naval base.
But justified or not, the worry is real, and the added probability of trade conflict is encouraging the thought that Japan had better learn to defend itself. One way is for company officials to blame foreign firms' own shortcomings for their failure to do better in Japan. In December a panel of businessmen demanded retaliation in kind should America impose punitive tariffs on Japanese exports. Japan's government has in the past shrunk from joining this chorus. But on January 25th a senior official at the Ministry of International Trade and Industry declared that Japan might indeed retaliate if the Clinton administration proved protectionist. And on February 3rd the chief cabinet secretary, Yohei Kono, said two tough new American trade bills break free-trade principles.
Other aspects of Japan's foreign policy maybe changing at least as much. The country's politicians have begun a debate on reforming the constitution to allow Japanese troops to fight abroad. This would allow Japan to take part in more UN peacekeeping operations, and so head off accusations that Japan is leaving the world's dirty jobs to others.
There are signs that the new assertiveness is already extending to Japan's dealings with America. Last month Yukio Sato, the head of the foreign ministry's North American department, wrote that Japan should set the two countries' relations on a more equal footing. To this, it should ""address economic and political issues through its own eyes and make its own opinions known to the world."" Quite so, but many Japanese wish that a man with a plan would show them how.","Bill Clinton is young; Japan's leaders are old. Mr Clinton means change; Japan's politics is famously unchanging.

The contrasts hurt. Japan's remarkable economic success has not brought a corresponding self-confidence. Its people envy Mr Clinton's vigour, yet are afraid to copy it. In short, Japan has a Clinton complex.
Nowhere is this more evident than on the vexed question of initiative. Mr Clinton was elected as the man with a plan, though Americans are starting to ask when he will implement any of it. Japan's politicians err in the opposite way: they shrink from spelling out their goals, even on occasions when they are doing something novel. An education system that stresses rote learning rather than argument, a career system that rewards seniority rather than precocious merit: both discourage the individualism and self-promotion that help make America. So reluctant are Japan's leaders to take the initiative that sometimes nothing seems to happen without foreign prompting.
The present debate on Japan's lacklustre economy is a case in point. When the Bank of Japan cuts interest rates, as it did on February 4th, lowering the discount rate from 3.25% to 2.5%, or when the finance ministry concedes a fiscal stimulus, many conclude that outsiders have prevailed upon Japan to rein in its trade surplus. If Japan stops penalising its consumers by protecting its rice market, foreigners will again be given the credit.
The same eminence blache lurks behind many lesser decisions. Last month an American gained the highest rank in sumo wrestling; perhaps he should thank the American protests last year when a compatriot was denied similar promotion. An imperial wedding was announced early, because a foreign newspaper had decided to report it.
Japan might fairly shrug off comparisons with reigners. After all, its economic management has been sounder than America's. Its sportsmen do not take drugs. Its imperial family is free of divorces. Takashi Inogouchi, a professor at Tokyo University, argues that Japan is often quicker than America to implement change, but is slower to discuss it. In 1985 Japan submitted to American pressure and agreed to double domestic demand; America, for its part, said it would tackle its budget deficit. By 1990 Japan had made good its side of the bargain. America had not.
Yet most Japanese are remarkably uncheered by such evidence. They feel unglamorous. They are hurt by foreigners taunts: that they live in rabbit hutches and are economic animals, and that their constitutional restrictions on sending troops to fight abroad are a form of cowardly introversion. Japanese journalists often reveal the national paranoia by reporting on what Tokyo-based foreigners are reporting.
Mr Clinton is increasing the Paranoia, partly because of his fresh-laced energy and partly because of the team around him. Winston Lord, the man he has nominated to take charge of Asia at the State Department, is a China expert. The same goes for Kent Wiedemann, the nominee for Asia in the National Security Council. The top trade negotiator, Mickey Kantor, has no experience in trade. True, Laura Tyson the head of the Council of Economic Advisers, does know about Japan, but her views are not encouraging. She believes in tough action to prise open ""structural"" barriers protecting Japan's market. Japanese firms collude to exclude outsiders, she thinks, so America must do more than encourage Japan to lift tariffs.
There will probably be more hard talk, because Japan's trade surplus is soaring. Until recently the Japanese soothingly pointed out that, despite the rise in their worldwide surplus, their surplus with America was not growing. On January 22nd, however, Decembers trade figures were published, showing that the surplus with America was up 14.3% on the previous year. As America's economy takes off, it will suck in still more imports. Five days later, when America imposed steel duties on 19 countries, Japan's pessimists sensed the first shock of the coming trade war.
In fact Japan's steel exporters were less heavily penalised than European ones; and the duties resulted from a complaint lodged with America's Commerce apartment by the steel producers last June. In other areas, too, Japan's nervousness over the new administration may be overdone. The Japanese fret that their prime minister, Kiichi Miyazawa, has failed to secure an early audience with Mr Clinton. But then Mr Clinton wants desperately not to be a foreign-policy president. The Japanese concern that America will pull back from Asia may be similarly exaggerated; the only withdrawal so far has been an unwilling departure from the Philippines' Subic Bay naval base.
But justified or not, the worry is real, and the added probability of trade conflict is encouraging the thought that Japan had better learn to defend itself. One way is for company officials to blame foreign firms' own shortcomings for their failure to do better in Japan. In December a panel of businessmen demanded retaliation in kind should America impose punitive tariffs on Japanese exports. Japan's government has in the past shrunk from joining this chorus. But on January 25th a senior official at the Ministry of International Trade and Industry declared that Japan might indeed retaliate if the Clinton administration proved protectionist. And on February 3rd the chief cabinet secretary, Yohei Kono, said two tough new American trade bills break free-trade principles.
Other aspects of Japan's foreign policy maybe changing at least as much. The country's politicians have begun a debate on reforming the constitution to allow Japanese troops to fight abroad. This would allow Japan to take part in more UN peacekeeping operations, and so head off accusations that Japan is leaving the world's dirty jobs to others.
There are signs that the new assertiveness is already extending to Japan's dealings with America. Last month Yukio Sato, the head of the foreign ministry's North American department, wrote that Japan should set the two countries' relations on a more equal footing. To this, it should ""address economic and political issues through its own eyes and make its own opinions known to the world.""

Mr Kumagai quotes a series of complacent comments about the economy made by Mr Miyazawa since becoming prime minister in 1991.
In the article Mr Kumagai also says that over-regulation and heavy-handed administrative guidance to ministers are stifling the economy. He says that unless Japan deregulates and does more to promote internal demand, it risks economic isolation as a result of its rising trade surplus.

By controlling the biggest faction of the governing Liberal Democratic Party (Lop), both Kakuei Tanaka and Shin Kanemaru ruled Japan in their time; both were arrested for financial trickery. Yet being arrested for accepting bribes from Lockheed, an American aircraft maker, did nothing to upset Mr Tanaka's dominance. Even after he was found guilty, he stayed out of prison by appealing against the verdict, and went on running the country. Mr Kanemaru, by contrast, will not recover from his arrest on March 6th. A decade ago, when Mr Tanaka reigned, shady deals were deemed acceptable. No longer.
The depths of Mr Kanemaru's alleged shadiness are admittedly astonishing. In the three days after he was locked up, public prosecutors picking through his offices and houses found hoards of cash, bonds and gold bars worth as much as Y6 billion ($51m). The Lockheed bribe was a trifling Y500m. Since Mr Kanemaru has lately paid a mere 10m or so each year in tax, the prosecutors suspect him of evasion. He is due to be charged by March 13th, together with his private secretary.
This comes on top of Mr Kanemaru's humbling in last year's scandal involving a company called Sagawa Kyubin. In August Mr Kanemaru admitted taking a Y500m donation from the company. At first he seemed likely to shrug this off, in a style Mr Tanaka would have been proud of. He paid a token fine in September of Y200,000--about the same as some of Tokyo's parking fines--and then retired home to play mahjong, refusing for weeks to answer questions on what he had done with the illegal money. Yet Mr Kanemaru presumed too much on his countrymen's indulgence. Their outcry grew so strong that in October he had to resign from the Diet (parliament).
The popular indignation may explain why Mr Kanemaru has now been arrested. The prosecutor's office was criticised for being soft on him last year; by locking him up, it may hope to restore its credibility. Yet other, more elaborate, explanations abound which may shed light on the big question in Japan: will public anger cleanse and enhance the country's democracy?
The most popular elaboration goes like this. To nail tax-evaders, the prosecutor needs help from the tax authorities. These come under the Ministry of Finance. The prime minister, Kiichi Miyazawa, once worked in that ministry. Mr Miyazawa may have told his chums to investigate Mr Kanemaru: not because he has anything against the man, but because he wants to hobble one of Mr Kanemaru's associates.
Who might that be? Most people reckon that the prosecutor's obvious next target is Noboru Takeshita, one of the prime ministers whom Mr Kanemaru put in office. But the associate who really worries the prime minister is Ichiro Ozawa. Mr Ozawa climbed the LDP ladder as Mr Kanemaru's protege, so was presumably involved in many of his shady dealings. He now says he wants to replace continuous LDP rule with two-party democracy and hints he may leave to set up a new party. Mr Ozawa makes this offence worse with calls for more deployment of Japanese troops abroad, an idea of which Mr Miyazawa is chary. Mr Miyazawa may hope that, with Mr Kanemaru in jail, the troublesome protege will lie low lest the tax men come after him. That would squash one hope for greater pluralism.
But if this is indeed Mr Miyazawa's plan, it is a dangerous one. The arrest may harm the LDP as much as Mr Ozawa, and the party faces a general election this autumn. Before the arrest, the government's abysmal opinion-poll rating had improved a bit since the depths of the Sagawa Kyubin scandal: in February 21.6% said they approved of the cabinet, up from 14.7% in December. The news that an LDP boss had amassed billions of yen--apparently for his own benefit rather than to pay for political campaigns--is unlikely to go down well in noodle bars around the land. The Japanese like to boast that their country is free from shocking disparities in wealth.
To polish the party's image, the LDP is promising political reform. On March 2nd--perhaps with knowledge of the coming arrest--the party announced the outlines of two bills to change Japan's electoral system. These are more radical than expected. If voted into law, the bills will replace Japan's multi-member constituencies with single-member ones. The existing system obliges LDP candidates to compete against each other. Since they buy popularity with bribes, reform of the system may reduce the amount of dirty money in politics.
On March 4th the LDP announced two further bills: to limit to two the number of fund-raising organisations that each politician may run (at present, limits on the size of donations are circumvented by splitting big ones among many fund-raisin outfits) and to give public subsidies to campaigning, so reducing the need to take bribes.
Before Mr Kanemaru's arrest, many doubted whether the LDP was serious about these ideas. Now the doubts have softened. If Mr Kanemaru helps reform along, it will be a happy irony.","For a taste of how Japan has changed , compare the arrests of two of its master politicians .

In the centre would be Singapore, Malaysia, Brunei and Cambodia. Together they would add up to a resource-rich area of 400m people, most of them under the age of 15. By the turn of the century they could constitute the world's most dynamic economic grouping. In August 1988 General Chatichai Choonhavan, then the prime minister of Thailand, found a name for that dream: suwannaphume, the ""golden land"".
It is a prospect that has grown more enticing. Last January Japan's prime minister, Kiichi Miyazawa, went to Bangkok and proposed the creation of a ""forum for the comprehensive development of Indochina"". The following month President Francois Mitterrand made a visit to two of France's former colonies, Vietnam and Cambodia--the first by a western head of state since America's troops abandoned Indochina to communism.
Where politicians go, businessmen have gone before them: the few decent hotels in what was formerly French Indochina--Vietnam, Cambodia and Laos--are booked to the rafters by wheeler-dealers from Singapore, Bankok, Taiwan and Hong Kong Last month they had to juggle their accommodation to fit in not just President Mitterrand's encourage but also a visiting delegation of more than 120 members of Japan's industrialists' association, the Keidanren. Last year the Association of South-East Asian Nations--Thailand, Sinapore, Brunei, Malaysia, Indonesia and the Philippines--signed a treaty of ""amity and co-operation"" with Vietnam and Laos. Permanent residents, such as French bankers and British oilmen, grow more numerous by the month, paying extortionate rents for refurbished villas in Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh City (as the communists renamed Saigon). Clearly, plenty of people reckon the golden dream will become reality.
But not even the optimistic General Chatichai believed in instant alchemy. Almost five years on, the sobering reality is that Myanmar, with its military junta, is an international pariah; Cambodia is teetering between insecure semi-democracy and renewed civil war; and Vietnam, thanks to American obstinacy, remains cut off from the international credits needed to develop its economy. As for the 4m people oflandlocked Laos, poor they were and poor they remain. Is there any point in dreaming?
It depends whether the region's economics drives its politics, or vice versa. A generation ago politics was in the driving seat. In 1975, for example, South Vietnam fell to the communist North; the Khmers Rouges, in mad pursuit of agrarian revolution, emptied Cambodia's cities, butchered its middle class and returned the country to ""year zero""; and the communist Pathet Lao declared a people's republic in Laos. To the ASEAN countries the advancing forces of Marx and Mao may not have appeared irresistible, but certainly menacin. Meanwhile, Burma, as it still called itself, was in self-imposed, near-absolute isolation.
Now move on a decade. In November 1986 Laos introduced its ""new economic management"" programme; the following month Vietnam approved a policy of doi moi (renovation); and in 1988 Myanmar announced an ""open-door policy"". All these were variations ofthe same liberalising tendency: greater autonomy for state enterprises; encouragement for private businessmen and foregin investors; relaxation of many price controls. Even Cambodia, under Vietnamese dominance but locked in civil war, joined the trend, emphasisin the private sector in its five-year plan of 1986-90 and writing laws for foreign investment in 1989. Rather than threatening ASEAN, its leftist neighbours were trying to emulate it.
WHERE THE GRASS WAS GREENER
There were many reasons for Indochina's change of heart. One was the sheer difficulty in the 1970s of exporting communist politics to ASEAN. Internal security forces cracked down on any symptoms of Matxism, be they in Jakarta or Singapore. At the same time, South-East Asia's various defence treaties with the West, and the American bases in the Philippines, ruled out militaly action. True, there was a growing communist insurency in the Philippines, but even in reaction to the worst excesses of President Marcos it could never develop enouh popular support to topple the government.
Another factor was the diminishing power of the Soviet Union, Indochina's superpower patron. After Mikhail Gorbachev took over in 1985, the Soviet Union became less willing to support decrepit economies to keep its Asian empire intact--and soon it became not just unwilling to do so but unable.
The biggest reason, though was the simplest: the ever-increasing and ever more obvious prosperity of South-East Asia's market economies. By the mid-1980s the most pur-blind member of Indochina's ruling parties could not fail to notice that the grass was indeed greener in Thailand, let alone Sinapore and Malaysia. Even Indonesia, statistically ASEAN'S poorest member, was better off than Vietnam. And the gap between the fast-growing market economies and the ones held back by central planning was growing wider, thanks not least to the influx of foreign investment, especially from Japan. The ASEAN economies collectively doubled in size during the 1970s, and again during the 1980s.
CHALLENGE AND RESPONSE
For the people of ASEAN, that economic growth means that fewer and fewer people live in what the World Bank calls ""absolute poverty""--having fewer than 2,150 calories a day. In 1970 three-fifths of Indonesia's people lived below this poverty line; by 1980 the proportion was down to 29%; by 1990 to 15%. For Thailand the equivalent figures were 26%, 17% and 16% (a levelling-off which partly reflects the persistent inequality between Bangkok and the rest of the country). Even the Philippines, which fell spectacularly from race in the mid-1980s, manaed to reduce its figures from 35% in 1970 to 30% in 1980 and 21% in 1990. As for Malaysia and Singapore, they have prospered so well that abject poverty is more or less illegal.
Comparable statistics for the centrally planned economies are hard to find. They measure ""net material product"", excluding services and depreciation. Any translation into the familiar gross domestic product of market economies involves heroic assumptions--pointless ones if the original figures were anyway concocted to be politically correct. The Asian Development Bank puts Vietnam's CDP per head in 1990 at about $200, as against around $1,400 for Thailand. Allow for differences in purchasing power, and the UN Development Programme gives Vietnam a GDP per person of $1,000--and Thailand $3,570.
So much for figures. The reality that can be seen, touched, heard and on occasion sniffed is that the averae Vietnamese, Lao, Cambodian or Burmese is dirt-poor. Bankok's street vendors peddle fake designer watches to foreign tourists; Hanoi's mend odd bits of ancient machinery for other townsfolk, or give them shaves and haircuts in front of cracked pieces of mirror. The command economy has made Indochina feel horribly poor.
Even its governments have realised this. In Vietnam, for example, the doctrinaire revolutionaries who won the war but then lost the peace have given way to economic pramatists. One sin of this was the retirement in the late 1980s of the one-time president and Communist Party general secretary, Truong Chinh (a nom de guerre that means ""long march""), and of his colleaue, Le Duc Tho. With both now dead, the political pendulum has swung in favour of economic liberals such as Nguyen Van Linh, a former party leader, and Vo Van Kiet, appointed last year as prime minister.
The swing to the pragmatists should be no surprise. Bereft of outside patrons and challened to find jobs for growing populations, the command economies have no choice but to command less and liberalise more. In the biggest of them, Vietnam, the workforce expands by 1.2m people a year. On top, it has to absorb demobilised soldiers: maybe 300,000 in the past year, suggest western sources; twice as many, say overnment figures. And all this while Vietnam copes with the collapse of a Soviet empire which supported its budet, bought most of its exports and provided many essential imports such as oil products, chemicals, fertiliser and steel.
So far the shift to the market is working. Indochina's ""informal sector""--witness the contraband markets in Ho Chi Minh City, Phnom Penh and Vientiane--gives livelihoods to legions of the otherwise unemployed or underemployed. A typical civil servant in Vietnam needs at least one other source of income to keep his family. Fortunately, the invisible hand provides: he gives private lessons, or sells noodles on a street corner, or extorts bribes, or receives money from relatives amon those 1.5m or so Vietnamese who have left since the fall of Saigon.
Myanmar, having officially abandoned the ""Burmese way to socialism"" in 1988, has manaed a minor boom so far in the 199Os: new roads and brides, new timber exports, rising property prices. So too in Laos, where the clothing industry is increasinly an alternative to the opium-poppy fields. In Vietnam, Pham Chi Lan, deputy head of the chamber of commerce and industry, points out that exports to the rich countries of Asia have exceeded those to the former Comecon area for the past four years; that Vietnam has emerged as the world's third-biggest rice exporter (after Thailand and America); and that the state's once complete hold on the economy has fallen to 60% in industry, 40% in services and a mere 2% in agriculture. All, she says, is ""thanks to doi moi.""
True enough. The success of doi moi and its siblings beins by increasing food production. As China demonstrated in the early 1980s, this happens once a farmer has quasi-ownership, through a long lease of the land he tills, and once he is allowed to sell his produce freely. The success continues by allowing private-sector industries to co-exist with state-owned zones; by freeing prices; by privatising (the Vietnamese prefer to say ""equitising"") state assets; by setting up export-promotion zones; by running realistic exchange rates. When countries start from as far back as Vietnam or Laos, such steps are bound to produce some quick gains.
But they also produce problems. No communist country in Asia, not even China, where Den Xiaoping's reforms started as far back as 1978, has made the full transition to a market economy. Instead, all are grappling with the question--socially and politically sensitive--of how to close surplus state factories. All have the same hope: that foreign markets and, especially, foreign investment will somehow provide enough jobs to square the circle.
THE BURDEN OF INSECURITY
Easier hoped for than achieved. Collectively, Indochina has much to offer the outside world: the forests and precious stones of Myanmar and Cambodia; the probable oil and gas fields off the Vietnamese coast; the tourist potential of beautiful highlands, unspoilt beaches and artistic miracles such as Angkor Wat. In the words of many an astute businessman in Bangkok and Sinapore, Indochina is like ASEAN was 20 years ago, but with a better-educated workforce (the literacy rate in Vietnam is almost 90%). Why, therefore, should Indochina not prosper just as ASEAN did?
The answer is that Indochina in the 1990s looks nowhere near as attractive to foreign investors as ASEAN did in the 1980s, when the market economies received investments worth $38 billion (the largest share coming from Japan). Vietnam now has one of the world's most liberal laws on foreign investment--yet in six years it has garnered only about $3 billion of foreign investment, three-quarters of it in the south, where the commercial tradition has much deeper roots than in the north. Moreover, most of the investment has so far only been pledged, rather than delivered. Far less still has one into Myanmar, Cambodia and tiny Laos.
One reason for the scarcity of foreign investment in Indochina is that it takes time for undeveloped economies to absorb capital. Another is the Americans' continuing prejudice against Vietnam. But the biggest reason is that ASEAN in the 1980s (despite the fall of Marcos in the Philippines and a couple of coup attempts in Thailand) was a region of peace and stability; so far, Indochina in the 1990s is not. Pessimists fear it never will be.
They could be right. General Chatichai's suwannaphume will work only if trade can flow freely across peaceful frontiers. That implies a lasting peace in Cambodia. Supposedly, that will come from the elections to be held there on May 23rd-25th. But already the Khmers Roues, one ofthe four factions ofthe civil war that began in December 1978 and was, in theory, ended by the Paris accords of October 1991, are boycotting the electoral process. The good intentions of Paris could easily collapse into a resumed civil war--especially since Cambodia's economic reforms have so far benefited not the peasantry, backers of the Khmers Rouges in the past, but an elite in Phnom Penh.
And what then? The economic pivot of the region's development is Vietnam, but President Bush refused to lift the trade and aid embago that the United States has kept in force ever since the two countries were at war. Instead, America gave Vietnam a ""road map"" of the conditions that it must meet for full reconition: things like taking its troops out of Cambodia and giving full information on American servicemen still listed as missing in action during the war. All the conditions have been met, except one over which Vietnam now has little control--sustained democracy in Cambodia. Will President Clinton maintain the embargo? If so, America will block Vietnam's access to the World Bank and Asian Development Bank loans that it needs--$1 billion a year of them, says one estimate--to rebuild its infrastructure, still showing the effects of American bombing 20-25 years ago.
What hope then for the official goal that by the year 2000 the economy will be twice as big as in 1990? The answer is, none. The prime minister, Mr Kiet, says Vietnam needs to invest $40 billion during that period; by the calculations of Nguyen Xuan Oanh, an engaging economist who was once the prime minister of South Vietnam, the country needs ten years and $2.8 billion a year in foreign investment to reach economic take-off. Although Japan resumed aid to Vietnam last November, and although from December American firms have been allowed to sign--but not implement--contracts with Vietnam, such money will come only when stability is guaranteed.
WORTH STRIVING FOR
Does it matter if the golden land proves a fantasy? Yes. Not that the Thai vision of gold is everyone's. Much of the business being done in Myanmar and Indochina is environmental pillage. Thai generals make dubious but mutually profitable alliances with the authorities in Myanmar and with the Khmers Roues in Cambodia to export logs and gems. So do dealers from Singapore, Hong Kong and Taiwan--a Chinese network which has few scruples. Myanmar's military regime thereby gets the hard currency that it needs to buy weaponry and to stay in power. The Khmers Roues likewise get the supplies they need, in defiance of trade sanctions imposed on them by the VN at the beinning of this year.
Cynics say that General Chatichai's concept had nothing to do with harmonious economic development; it was simply a form of Thai economic imperialism. Thai ideas for the reion include building a road from north-east Thailand through Laos to the central Vietnamese port of Danan, and harnessing the upper waters of the Mekong river to provide power and irriation for Thailand, Myanmar, Laos, Vietnam and southem China. The capital, it seems, would come from a proposed Thai-Japan ""Indochina development fund""--but few doubt that the political and commercial benefit would accure mainly to Thailand.
Yet, even thouh the general's suyannaphume may be flawed, the dream is still worthwhile. As any capitalist country can show, economic development is never to be rejected merely because it makes some people or class much richer than others, or than they seem to deserve. And a wider objective too would be served. Indochina, like Europe, has suffered repeated wars. Thai, Burmese, Khmer and Vietnamese kingdoms were at odds a thousand years ago, and ethnic mistrust persists between Thai and Vietnamese, Khmer and Vietnamese, Vietnamese and Chinese. There could be more conflict. The Lao and Thai armies clashed as recently as 1988; tension is sometimes high on the border between Thailand and Myanmar; and sovereignty over the Spratly islands, in the South China Sea, is disputed by Vietnam, Malaysia, Brunei, the Philippines, China and Taiwan. Against that backround, even a tarnished suwannaphume of economic co-operation makes sense. Like Europe, South-East Asia could find economic integration a source not only of wealth but of peace.","Dream of a free market, from the vast Indonesian archipelago in the south to Myanmar (as Burma now prefers to be called), Laos and Vietnam in the north. In the centre would be Singapore, Malaysia, Brunei and Cambodia. Together they would add up to a resource-rich area of 400m people, most of them under the age of 15. By the turn of the century they could constitute the world's most dynamic economic grouping. In August 1988 General Chatichai Choonhavan, then the prime minister of Thailand, found a name for that dream: suwannaphume, the ""golden land"".
It is a prospect that has grown more enticing. Last January Japan's prime minister, Kiichi Miyazawa, went to Bangkok and proposed the creation of a ""forum for the comprehensive development of Indochina"". The following month President Francois Mitterrand made a visit to two of France's former colonies, Vietnam and Cambodia--the first by a western head of state since America's troops abandoned Indochina to communism.
Where politicians go, businessmen have gone before them: the few decent hotels in what was formerly French Indochina--Vietnam, Cambodia and Laos--are booked to the rafters by wheeler-dealers from Singapore, Bankok, Taiwan and Hong Kong Last month they had to juggle their accommodation to fit in not just President Mitterrand's encourage but also a visiting delegation of more than 120 members of Japan's industrialists' association, the Keidanren. Last year the Association of South-East Asian Nations--Thailand, Sinapore, Brunei, Malaysia, Indonesia and the Philippines--signed a treaty of ""amity and co-operation"" with Vietnam and Laos. Permanent residents, such as French bankers and British oilmen, grow more numerous by the month, paying extortionate rents for refurbished villas in Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh City (as the communists renamed Saigon). Clearly, plenty of people reckon the golden dream will become reality.
But not even the optimistic General Chatichai believed in instant alchemy. Almost five years on, the sobering reality is that Myanmar, with its military junta, is an international pariah; Cambodia is teetering between insecure semi-democracy and renewed civil war; and Vietnam, thanks to American obstinacy, remains cut off from the international credits needed to develop its economy. As for the 4m people oflandlocked Laos, poor they were and poor they remain. Is there any point in dreaming?
It depends whether the region's economics drives its politics, or vice versa. A generation ago politics was in the driving seat. In 1975, for example, South Vietnam fell to the communist North; the Khmers Rouges, in mad pursuit of agrarian revolution, emptied Cambodia's cities, butchered its middle class and returned the country to ""year zero""; and the communist Pathet Lao declared a people's republic in Laos. To the ASEAN countries the advancing forces of Marx and Mao may not have appeared irresistible, but certainly menacin. Meanwhile, Burma, as it still called itself, was in self-imposed, near-absolute isolation.
Now move on a decade. In November 1986 Laos introduced its ""new economic management"" programme; the following month Vietnam approved a policy of doi moi (renovation); and in 1988 Myanmar announced an ""open-door policy"". All these were variations ofthe same liberalising tendency: greater autonomy for state enterprises; encouragement for private businessmen and foregin investors; relaxation of many price controls. Even Cambodia, under Vietnamese dominance but locked in civil war, joined the trend, emphasisin the private sector in its five-year plan of 1986-90 and writing laws for foreign investment in 1989. Rather than threatening ASEAN, its leftist neighbours were trying to emulate it.
WHERE THE GRASS WAS GREENER
There were many reasons for Indochina's change of heart. One was the sheer difficulty in the 1970s of exporting communist politics to ASEAN. Internal security forces cracked down on any symptoms of Matxism, be they in Jakarta or Singapore. At the same time, South-East Asia's various defence treaties with the West, and the American bases in the Philippines, ruled out militaly action. True, there was a growing communist insurency in the Philippines, but even in reaction to the worst excesses of President Marcos it could never develop enouh popular support to topple the government.
Another factor was the diminishing power of the Soviet Union, Indochina's superpower patron. After Mikhail Gorbachev took over in 1985, the Soviet Union became less willing to support decrepit economies to keep its Asian empire intact--and soon it became not just unwilling to do so but unable.
The biggest reason, though was the simplest: the ever-increasing and ever more obvious prosperity of South-East Asia's market economies. By the mid-1980s the most pur-blind member of Indochina's ruling parties could not fail to notice that the grass was indeed greener in Thailand, let alone Sinapore and Malaysia. Even Indonesia, statistically ASEAN'S poorest member, was better off than Vietnam. And the gap between the fast-growing market economies and the ones held back by central planning was growing wider, thanks not least to the influx of foreign investment, especially from Japan. The ASEAN economies collectively doubled in size during the 1970s, and again during the 1980s.
CHALLENGE AND RESPONSE
For the people of ASEAN, that economic growth means that fewer and fewer people live in what the World Bank calls ""absolute poverty""--having fewer than 2,150 calories a day. In 1970 three-fifths of Indonesia's people lived below this poverty line; by 1980 the proportion was down to 29%; by 1990 to 15%. For Thailand the equivalent figures were 26%, 17% and 16% (a levelling-off which partly reflects the persistent inequality between Bangkok and the rest of the country). Even the Philippines, which fell spectacularly from race in the mid-1980s, manaed to reduce its figures from 35% in 1970 to 30% in 1980 and 21% in 1990. As for Malaysia and Singapore, they have prospered so well that abject poverty is more or less illegal.
Comparable statistics for the centrally planned economies are hard to find. They measure ""net material product"", excluding services and depreciation. Any translation into the familiar gross domestic product of market economies involves heroic assumptions--pointless ones if the original figures were anyway concocted to be politically correct. The Asian Development Bank puts Vietnam's CDP per head in 1990 at about $200, as against around $1,400 for Thailand. Allow for differences in purchasing power, and the UN Development Programme gives Vietnam a GDP per person of $1,000--and Thailand $3,570.
So much for figures. The reality that can be seen, touched, heard and on occasion sniffed is that the averae Vietnamese, Lao, Cambodian or Burmese is dirt-poor. Bankok's street vendors peddle fake designer watches to foreign tourists; Hanoi's mend odd bits of ancient machinery for other townsfolk, or give them shaves and haircuts in front of cracked pieces of mirror. The command economy has made Indochina feel horribly poor.
Even its governments have realised this. In Vietnam, for example, the doctrinaire revolutionaries who won the war but then lost the peace have given way to economic pramatists. One sin of this was the retirement in the late 1980s of the one-time president and Communist Party general secretary, Truong Chinh (a nom de guerre that means ""long march""), and of his colleaue, Le Duc Tho. With both now dead, the political pendulum has swung in favour of economic liberals such as Nguyen Van Linh, a former party leader, and Vo Van Kiet, appointed last year as prime minister.
The swing to the pragmatists should be no surprise. Bereft of outside patrons and challened to find jobs for growing populations, the command economies have no choice but to command less and liberalise more. In the biggest of them, Vietnam, the workforce expands by 1.2m people a year. On top, it has to absorb demobilised soldiers: maybe 300,000 in the past year, suggest western sources; twice as many, say overnment figures. And all this while Vietnam copes with the collapse of a Soviet empire which supported its budet, bought most of its exports and provided many essential imports such as oil products, chemicals, fertiliser and steel.
So far the shift to the market is working. Indochina's ""informal sector""--witness the contraband markets in Ho Chi Minh City, Phnom Penh and Vientiane--gives livelihoods to legions of the otherwise unemployed or underemployed. A typical civil servant in Vietnam needs at least one other source of income to keep his family. Fortunately, the invisible hand provides: he gives private lessons, or sells noodles on a street corner, or extorts bribes, or receives money from relatives amon those 1.5m or so Vietnamese who have left since the fall of Saigon.
Myanmar, having officially abandoned the ""Burmese way to socialism"" in 1988, has manaed a minor boom so far in the 199Os: new roads and brides, new timber exports, rising property prices. So too in Laos, where the clothing industry is increasinly an alternative to the opium-poppy fields. In Vietnam, Pham Chi Lan, deputy head of the chamber of commerce and industry, points out that exports to the rich countries of Asia have exceeded those to the former Comecon area for the past four years; that Vietnam has emerged as the world's third-biggest rice exporter (after Thailand and America); and that the state's once complete hold on the economy has fallen to 60% in industry, 40% in services and a mere 2% in agriculture. All, she says, is ""thanks to doi moi.""
True enough. The success of doi moi and its siblings beins by increasing food production. As China demonstrated in the early 1980s, this happens once a farmer has quasi-ownership, through a long lease of the land he tills, and once he is allowed to sell his produce freely. The success continues by allowing private-sector industries to co-exist with state-owned zones; by freeing prices; by privatising (the Vietnamese prefer to say ""equitising"") state assets; by setting up export-promotion zones; by running realistic exchange rates. When countries start from as far back as Vietnam or Laos, such steps are bound to produce some quick gains.
But they also produce problems. No communist country in Asia, not even China, where Den Xiaoping's reforms started as far back as 1978, has made the full transition to a market economy. Instead, all are grappling with the question--socially and politically sensitive--of how to close surplus state factories. All have the same hope: that foreign markets and, especially, foreign investment will somehow provide enough jobs to square the circle.
THE BURDEN OF INSECURITY
Easier hoped for than achieved. Collectively, Indochina has much to offer the outside world: the forests and precious stones of Myanmar and Cambodia; the probable oil and gas fields off the Vietnamese coast; the tourist potential of beautiful highlands, unspoilt beaches and artistic miracles such as Angkor Wat. In the words of many an astute businessman in Bangkok and Sinapore, Indochina is like ASEAN was 20 years ago, but with a better-educated workforce (the literacy rate in Vietnam is almost 90%). Why, therefore, should Indochina not prosper just as ASEAN did?
The answer is that Indochina in the 1990s looks nowhere near as attractive to foreign investors as ASEAN did in the 1980s, when the market economies received investments worth $38 billion (the largest share coming from Japan). Vietnam now has one of the world's most liberal laws on foreign investment--yet in six years it has garnered only about $3 billion of foreign investment, three-quarters of it in the south, where the commercial tradition has much deeper roots than in the north. Moreover, most of the investment has so far only been pledged, rather than delivered. Far less still has one into Myanmar, Cambodia and tiny Laos.
One reason for the scarcity of foreign investment in Indochina is that it takes time for undeveloped economies to absorb capital. Another is the Americans' continuing prejudice against Vietnam. But the biggest reason is that ASEAN in the 1980s (despite the fall of Marcos in the Philippines and a couple of coup attempts in Thailand) was a region of peace and stability; so far, Indochina in the 1990s is not. Pessimists fear it never will be.
They could be right. General Chatichai's suwannaphume will work only if trade can flow freely across peaceful frontiers. That implies a lasting peace in Cambodia. Supposedly, that will come from the elections to be held there on May 23rd-25th. But already the Khmers Roues, one ofthe four factions ofthe civil war that began in December 1978 and was, in theory, ended by the Paris accords of October 1991, are boycotting the electoral process. The good intentions of Paris could easily collapse into a resumed civil war--especially since Cambodia's economic reforms have so far benefited not the peasantry, backers of the Khmers Rouges in the past, but an elite in Phnom Penh.
And what then? The economic pivot of the region's development is Vietnam, but President Bush refused to lift the trade and aid embago that the United States has kept in force ever since the two countries were at war. Instead, America gave Vietnam a ""road map"" of the conditions that it must meet for full reconition: things like taking its troops out of Cambodia and giving full information on American servicemen still listed as missing in action during the war.

The new optimism about blue-chip companies has certainly been slow to spread to small-company shares traded on the over-the-counter market (see chart). (Chart omitted) That seems odd. Because small companies' earnings are more volatile than those of bigger firms, they ought to bounce back more quickly when the economy recovers. Kathy Matsui, an analyst at Barclays de Zoete Wedd, expects net profits of the 300 small companies she tracks to rise by 40% in the year to March 1994, after a fall of 41% in the financial year just ended. JASDAQ a screen-based trading system for OTC shares, has been running since December, making them easier to trade.
This has tempted foreign investors, who bought a net Y4.9 billion ($41m) of OTC stocks in February and another Y7.5 billion in the following three weeks, according to Gary Chan of James Capel. They hope that other investors are holding back for regulatory reasons and because OTC shares are illiquid, not because of any doubts about small firms' prospects. Japan's public pension funds, for instance, have poured money into blue chips as part of the government's effort to support the main market; but they are forbidden to invest in OTC stocks.
Liquidity has also drawn other investors to the main market. Hedge funds, for instance, do not bother with small shares, preferring to short bigger ones. When these bean their recent rise, hedge funds rushed to buy them to cover their positions: this gave the main market a useful push upwards. Similarly international investors who were underweight in Tokyo piled into Japanese shares last month; missing out might have meant underperforming the world equity index. They had to buy fast, so they chose liquid shares with familiar names.
One group of investors traditionally not shy of small shares is Japan's private punters. They account for half the OTC market's turnover. But they have yet to recover from the trauma of Tokyo's bear market. They sold a net Y3.8 billion of OTC shares in February, and were still selling in March.
Using these arguments, optimists say that there are no fundamental grounds for small shares failing to rise with big ones. Hence, after a short lag, they ought to follow the main market upwards, just as in previous cycles. Look again, however. The recent economic slowdown has been different from its predecessors; the recovery, when it arrives, will also be different.
The oil shocks of the 1970s, and the abrupt rise of the yen in 1986, made life especially hard for Japanese exporters. This time the domestic slowdown has meant that firms catering to the home market have been hardest hit. Exports, particularly those aimed at the booming American market, are holding up. Big firms export a greater share of their output than small ones.
This cycle also differs in the degree of distress in the financial system. Banks are burdened with bad debts just when they need to meet new international capital-adequacy standards; so bank lending has been flattish for two years. Japanese banks trim loans to small companies first, because they are riskier and because small firms are too young to have close relationships with their bankers. Big companies also have the let-out of the bond market. This market is too immature to accommodate small firms; and Japan has no junk-bond market.
The Bank of Japan denies that small companies have trouble raising money. Its regular survey of confidence finds that more small companies still choose the word ""accommodative"" rather than ""severe"" to describe bank attitudes. Others are more concerned. The finance ministry has urged banks to lend to small companies. The labour ministry has put back the deadline for small companies to reduce the working week from 48 to 44 hours. Recently the industry minister, Yoshiro Mori, said he was looking at ways of helping small companies to raise finance, possibly through more loans by government bodies.
In 1992 government and government backed loans made up 39% of new loans to small and medium-sized companies, up from 30% in 1991. Private bankers, too, are growing more sensitive to criticism. On March 30th Tsuneo Wakai, the chairman of the Japanese Federation of Bankers Associations, insisted that banks are ready to lend to small companies if they have sound managements.
Financial distress may also spring another nasty surprise on foreigners who have bought OTC shares. Partly because they are young, a bigger chunk of small firms' own share portfolios was bought at the top of the market. Some of them are now revealing big losses on these holdings. In November a note in the accounts of Osaka Organic Chemical, a firm quoted on the second section of Osaka's stock exchange, revealed an unrealised loss of Y900m on its equity holdings, far bigger than its Y739m profit. Those counting on a revival among the laggards may have a long wait.","Spring is in the air for Tokyo 's financiers . The Nikkei share average jumped by over 12 % in March .

Since September, when Mr Yeltsin cancelled a visit to Tokyo, Japan has been reluctant to offer much aid to Russia. The two countries' relations, said the Japanese, should expand in a ""balanced"" way: this meant that aid was conditional on the return by Russia of the Kurile islands off Japan's northern coast. Besides, Japan argued, Russia could not absorb aid usefully; and the Gorbachev precedent showed that Russia's hopes for reform do not depend on the survival of one leader. Confronted with forein determination to back Mr Yeltsin, however, Japan has caved in.
Japan's prime minister, Kiichi Miyazawa, now says that the meeting of G7 finance ministers, which will take place in Tokyo on April 14th and 15th, will promise lots of new aid to Russia. The figure may be around $30 billion, officials hint, which dwarfs the $1.6 billion in bilateral aid announced on April 4th by President Clinton, and even the $24 billion in multilateral aid promised to Russia last year. Japan, whisper the officials, will be among the most generous contributors.
Japan is falling back upon cheque-book diplomacy. As well as Russian aid, Mr Miyazawa is promising a supplementary budget--perhaps Y13 trillion ($115 billion) in extra spending on public works and other worthy causes. The aim is to boost demand and therefore imports, so helping to meet American complaints about Japan's trade surplus. The details of this boost are to be announced on April 13th,just in time for Mr Miyazawa's first meeting with Mr Clinton. The prime minister hopes that his two concessions --on Russia and on the economy--may win him the sympathy he needs to fend off trade sanctions.
All this recalls Japan's image during the Gulf war. Then, too, Japan wrote a cheque --or rather two, worth $13 billion. But it did so belatedly and, as a result, it seemed that it would not have paid without foreign insistence. For all its economic clout, Japan appeared woefully short on diplomatic savvy.
Yet Japan has changed a lot since then. Three months ao, Tokyo was full of talk of the country's new diplomacy. Japanese troops had left home soil for the first time since the second world war, to take part in the United Nations peace effort in Cambodia. Japan had shown its independence of America by its early resumption of aid to China and Vietnam. Mr Miyazawa had toured South-East Asia, proclaiming Japan's special relationship with the region. The new American secretary of state had said Japan deserved a permanent seat on the UN Security Council. The Tokyo summit of the Group of Seven was to have marked the new dignity of Japanese diplomacy.
So why has Japan allowed the Russian question to embarrass it? The answer lies in politics. Japanese who are uneasy about the endless rule of the Liberal Democratic Party argue that, without the vigorous debate that comes with a two-party system, Japan will always make decisions slowly; so it will never be able to lead internationally. A chief proponent of this view is Ichiro Ozawa, who rebelled against the status quo last year by splitting the ruling party's main faction. It seems only fitting that the political row that got Japan into the Yeltsin mess is ending in triumph for Mr Ozawa's movement.
Early last month, when the pressure for Russian aid was intensifying, Mr Miyazawa realised that he had better support the idea. But he was stopped by Michio Watanabe, his deputy and forein minister, who owed his job to the strenth of his faction rather than to the prime minister's favour. Mr Watanabe's men went on denying that there was to be a G7 ministerial meeting on aid, even after Mr Miyazawa's office had announced that there was.
In the meantime, however, Mr Watanabe's health weakened. On April 6th Mr Watanabe resigned. To replace him Mr Miyazawa tried to recruit Tsutomu Hata, who rebelled last year with Mr Ozawa. Mr Hata, as the older of the two men, is the formal head of the new breakaway faction. The two have vowed to push for political reform. By accepting the foreign minister's job, Mr Hata would have abandoned that promise. He refused it and the job went to the relatively unknown Kubun Muto, a member of Mr Watanabe's faction.
Political reform will not come easily. Mr Ozawa has been obliged to lie low by the investigation of his old mentor, Shin Kaneman, on charges of tax evasion. Though the government has drawn up some far-reaching political-reform bills, few think that Mr Miyazawa is serious about getting them passed. Mr Hata's stand keeps the reform hope alive. But it will be some time before Japan dances on the international stage as nimbly as its partners.","Help for Boris Yeltsin means Japan 's humiliation .

There have been many false dawns in the past three years of unrelenting gloom for Japan's stockmarket. But the latest rally, which has seen the Nikkei average rise by over 20% from its low point of the year, looks the most convincing so far. The reason is not the state of Japan's economy--which is still poor--but the changed tone of government policy.
The best argument for those who stayed determinedly bullish during Japan's three-year bear market was always that the Japanese government had the wherewithal to turn things round. Fighting the effects of asset deflation has now been raised to the top of the policy agenda in Japan. The latest confirmation came in press reports that the Japanese government plans another Y13 trillion ($115 billion) supplementary budget. After taking out the reclassifying of already-planned spending, some Y6 trillion of this will probably be genuine new spending. In last autumn's Y11 trillion supplementary budget only Y3 trillion turned out to be new. The details of the new budget will be announced formally by the prime minister, Kiichi Miyazawa, on April 13th, before he goes to Washington to meet President Clinton.
There is also room for more monetary easing. True, the Bank of Japan has already cut the official discount rate (ODR) six times in the past three years, to its present level of 2.5%. But with inflation now below 112% Japan still has positive real short-term interest rates--whereas they are negative in America. The recent surge in the yen has increased the pressure to ease, since it is hitting Japanese exporters. Peter Morgan, an economist at Merrill Lynch, expects the ODR to be cut to 1.75% this summer, which would allow short-term market rates to fall to 2.25%. This could be a powerful prop for share prices: Wall Street boomed on the back of low interest rates long before there was hard evidence of economic recovery.
The stockmarket has discounted both the supplementary budget, but not perhaps an ODR cut. The momentum behind the recent rally is impressive, both in price and volume. Peter Tasker, an investment strategist at Kleinwort Benson, says investors have undergone a ""schizophrenic shift in sentiment"". The most dramatic evidence has been the rally in NTT, the telephone company that is the market's bellwether share. Its price has doubled this year.
The Nikkei even understates the market's sure. The broader Topix index is now 10% above the high point it reached last autumn, after the rally that followed the previous supplementary budget. Had the Nikkei made a similar gain, it would now be at 21,000. Trading volumes too have shot up; turnover is up tenfold from January's depressed levels. On April 2nd the market saw its highest daily volume since November 1989, when the Nikkei was about to hit its all-time high.
Crude manipulation has certainly played a part in the rally. The latest deliberate press leaks suggest that the government may allocate Y9 trillion of public-sector cash (such as post-office savings and public pension funds) to support the market in the fiscal year that began on April 1st, compared with Y4 trillion last year. This is one reason foreign fund managers have been buying. They are convinced that the government has put a floor under the market. They are also encouraged by signs that the money supply has stopped falling. February saw the first year-on-year increase in M2-plus certificates of deposit since August.
In contrast, most Japanese institutional investors remain wary. They have reason to be cautious. Their unrealised capital gains shrank drastically during the bear market; they are scared that the market is still overvalued in price-earnings terms. Corporate earnings are expected to decline this year for the fourth year in a row. Kleinwort Benson expects earning to fall by 10% in the year to March 1994. This puts the Nikkei on a whopping prospective price-earnings ratio of nearly 80. Foreign investors are prepared to ignore this, because optimistic analysts are telling them that earning could double in the following fiscal year.
There are two ways to interpret the caution of domestic institutional investors. One is that the market could go much higher when they belatedly decide to join in. That would do more than fiscal easing to bring forward economic recovery. The stockmarket is a stronger leading economic indicator in Japan than in other countries, partly because Japanese banks count a portion of unrealised capital gains on shareholdings in their capital--thus allowing more bank lending. Cross-shareholding also help. The rise of 20% in the stockmarket has increased its capitalisation by Y60 trillion; since about two-thirds of that is represented by Japanese companies' cross-shareholdings, that has given corporate Japan a Y40 trillion increase in its financial wealth. That is equivalent to ten years' worth of today's depressed annual net profits.
Still, it would be foolish to get carried away. For the odds favour the second interpretation: that Japanese institutional investors will stay cautious. Today's bearish consensus about the stockmarket cannot be so easily broken. And if domestic institutions stay out and the economy weakens again the market could fall sharply in the summer--though in the short term a further rally to the 22,000 level is likely.
It is also too simple to see lower interest rates as a market panacea. Bulls believe that the Tokyo market will follow the precedent of Wall Street's interest-rate-driven boom. But there are differences between Tokyo and New York. Japanese companies have not yet begun the painful restructuring that many American companies have undergone. Japanese banks have yet to admit to their bad-debt problems--let alone reserve against them. And the strength of the yen is aggravating Japan's economic slowdown, while dollar weakness boosted America's recovery. Perhaps the dawn will again turn out to be false after all.","This time it really may be different .

Where necessary, that will mean demanding, with menaces, better access to foreign markets for American exporters.

The best objection to ""aggressive"" trade policies is not that they may harm others (which they do) or that they undermine the multilateral process of trade liberalisation that has served the world well for 40 years (which they also do); to emphasise such points can seem naive and unrealistic. The best objection is that such policies actually do most harm, in the end, to the aressor.
How can this be? How can it harm America's interests if Japan agrees (as it did in a deal on semiconductors) to expand America's share of Japan's market? It is easy to see how a pact of that sort may damage Japan.

It is also easy to see why third parties (exporters in Europe or Asia, for instance) may suffer. But so long as the policy of demanding with menaces works--ie, so long as American exports increase--how can America be the victim?
IN TRADE, TOLERANCE PAYS
One answer is that America may suffer retaliation in trade policy, or in other ways. It is in America's economic and strategic interests, as well as Japan's, to nurture the alliance between the two countries. If the Clinton administration's only policy towards Japan is its trade policy, and if that policy's only face is angry and complaining, something valuable is in danger. But there is also a subtler answer.
Openness to imports is not a burden that enfeebles an economy. If it were, America (one of the most open economies in the world) would not be so rich, and the once-closed economies of Eastern Europe would not be so poor. The first task for an intelligent trade policy is not to open foreign markets; more important is the goal of keeping one's own markets open. That way, domestic industries are obliged to compete, which is necessary if they are to innovate and seek greater efficiency.
By all means, a trade-policy ""activist"" might reply--but why should leaning on Japan to open its markets have the effect of closing America's? The question is--one hates to say it--naive and unrealistic. The domestic pressure for protection is relentless. To keep it in check, governments need to be shrewd. They need to deny the enemy opportunities and arguments. The administration seems ready to supply both.
To achieve market-sharing deals, the Clinton administration will have to threaten (as it already has) higher barriers to imports. If that threat is to remain credible, from time to time it will have to be carried through--and there will be no lack of voices accusing Mr Clinton of cowardice if he later backs down. Merely by issuing the threat, the administration announces to protectionists that it is open for business. And in the process it denies itself its best defence--a cogent intellectual argument. For if there are circumstances in which it makes economic sense to grant greater protection to, say, the American car industry (and the threat takes that as its premise), the administration can no loner deploy the economic argument for free trade with conviction.
In the past, Japan has bent to American pressure on trade, often in ways that have served the cause of managed, rather than open, markets. If, from now on, it politely says no to such arrangements, it will benefit not only itself but also--despite Mr Clinton's efforts to the contrary--America.","Though Bill Clinton has, as yet, no settled policy on trade, the signs are that he wants to be a lot more forceful than his relatively accommodating predecessor, George Bush.

The timing of the supplementary budget was determined by the need to appease Japan's main trading partner. But the sheer size of the package--Y13.2 trillion ($116.5 billion)--makes it clear that the usually tight-fisted finance ministry is genuinely worried about the fragility of the domestic economy.
Although no tax cuts were announced. this budget, the second in nine months, is likely to be more effective in stimulating the economy than last August's Y10.7 trillion effort. Baring Securities reckons that the amount of real new spending, as opposed to reclassification of existing spending, will amount to Y7.3 trillion, compared with the Y4 trillion of new money actually spent in last year's effort. The money is aimed at those areas of the economy most in need of help. Small and medium-sized companies will get subsidised loans of Y1.9 trillion; almost as much goes to home buyers. Those eligible to borrow money from the Housing Loan Corporation, which provides a third of all mortgages in Japan, can now borrow at a 30-year fixed and subsidised rate of just 4.1%. This is the lowest rate ever offered.
The details of the budget also illustrate the government's fears about the future of Japan's system of lifetime employment. A fund that subsidises jobs in struggling industries will see its cash increase from Y79 billion in 1992-93 to Y900m in 1993-94. In a Y480 trillion economy this may not be much, but it has some symbolic importance. Any company in which overtime and production have both declined for six consecutive months is eligible to apply to the fund. Among those preparing to ask for help are the giants of Japanese industry, the car makers.
Using taxpayers' money to help reduce the pain of restructuring in the Japanese car industry may not go down well in Detroit. Nor will the record $13.8 billion trade surplus in March help soothe the Americans. But the budget has probably met American demands that Japan should try to boost imports by stimulating its domestic economy--for the moment, at least.
There is, however, a danger that the fanfare surrounding this budget has raised expectations at home and abroad too high. The economy is not about to turn round immediately. This latest boost will not have much impact until later this year; and the banking system and the depressed property market need a long period of low interest rates, rather than a package of fiscal measures.
Consumer confidence also needs to be bolstered. Consumption, which accounts for nearly 60% of GNP, shows little sign of picking up yet. Sales in Tokyo's department stores fell by 11.4% in the year to March, their largest decline ever. Austerity is fashionable in Japan these days. Louis Vuitton bags are out, discount-store clothes are in. Pricey french restaurants are losing out to a vogue for cheap but healthy home cooking. People say that after-work drinking is on the decline.
But even if the Japanese cannot be persuaded to go out on a consumer spending spree, this package should at least avert the danger that the economy may actually contract. Baring Securities estimates that it will increase GNP growth in the fiscal year ending next March by 0.8%, bringing it up to 1.5%--rather more realistic than the official forecast that the economy will grow by 3.3% this fiscal year.","On April 13th , two days before setting off to Washington , Kiichi Miyazawa tore open the package Kiichi Miyazawa is offering to Kiichi Miyazawa's American hosts .

A lot of these thing honestly involve real debates over ideas...and the answers are not self-evident. And one of the reasons I wanted to run for president is to open the floodgates for debating ideas so that we could try to change in the appropriate way.""
Thus Bill Clinton, at a press conference on April 23rd, shortly before the 100th day of his presidency. Ask the thousands of FOBs--friends of Bill--why they have long thought that he would one day be a great president and their replies will sooner or later share the same point. The man likes ideas. He genuinely does. At any gathering of the faithful, he will stay up until the small hours debating ideas with all and sundry, pulling people with different backgrounds into the same conversation. He is that rare bird, the night-owl who likes talking without the prop of a strong drink in his hands.
Ideas, intelligence, he and his administration have aplenty. But the FOBS have, in the past, liked their man not just because he was interested in ideas for their own sake, but because he wanted to apply them to government. And if there is a question about the Clinton administration three months into its term it is not about whether he is an ""old"" or a ""new"" Democrat; as one of his advisers says, fairly, that will be clear one day. The problem is that the president does not know how to implement ""change in the appropriate way"".
Part of this is of his own making. The famous EGG formula--""ethnicity, gender and geography-has slowed the process of appointments in a way that has hurt the administration. It is no doubt laudable to try to craft an executive branch that ""looks like America"". But America does not look like a disorganised company most of whose workers do not have a boss; or at least it did not the last time it deserved worldwide respect. Part of the problem is that some of the younger Clintonians have got their priorities wrong. The White House may have all the computer wizardry in the world, but it lacked the old-fashioned political skills required to et a $16 billion ""stimulus"" package through the Senate.
It was that failure of implementation that seems to have prompted Leon Panetta, Mr Clinton's budget chief, to unburden himself of melancholy thoughts on April 26th. Mr Panetta thought not only that, at present, the mood in Congress is running against ratification of the North American Free Trade Agreement, but that the administration would have difficulty when it sends its health-care proposals to Capitol Hill this month. This will be the real test of whether ideas can be matched to implementation. That the health-care taskforce is engaged in thorough and original work on reform is not in doubt. But if Mr Clinton allows Congress, the doctors and the drug industry to pick apart his proposals, his public standing will suffer.
There is one other reason why Mr Clinton's implementation has lagged behind his ideas. For a man who studied and coveted the presidency for years, he seems to have been taken aback by the discovery that his time is not his own. An American president can decide to focus on domestic policy only up to a point; events in the wider world, leaders of other countries, have a habit of eating into time that the president thought he would spend on other thing.
Mr Clinton has spent far more time on foreign policy than he or most of his staff anticipated. Before the Vancouver summit with Boris Yeltsin, the Russian leader, he was devoting a third of his time to the summit agenda. In the second two weeks of April, he was locked in meeting after endless meeting on Bosnia.
One consequence of time spent on foreign policy is that there are still subjects on which the president himself has not laid down detailed marching orders to his staff. Trade policy is one of these issues. With the exception of preparation for his meeting with Kiichi Miyazawa, the prime minister of Japan, he has still not had a full-blown meeting on trade with his economic team. That has left the impression that trade policy is at the mercy of ad hoc decision-making by a variety of officials.
Education is another area that seems, so far, to have been Clintonless (surprisingly, given his experience in the subject as a governor). The package of education reforms unveiled by Richard Riley, the education secretary, on April 21st was frankly disappointing; more of the old policy of exhortation, together with voluntary codes of curriculum content and methods of assessment. Even given the limits that federalism imposes on any education plan (the federal government spends only 6% of the cash devoted to education) this was a damp squib.
How could such a disappointment have been avoided? For one answer, think back to the triumphant first term of Ronald Reagan. Crucial to Mr Reagan's success was the role in the White House of Jim Baker, his chief of staff; not only to get good thins done, but to make sure that bad things were left undone. A Baker in Mr Clinton's White House would never have let the education package out. A Baker would have imposed order on the question of whether or not the administration is flirting with a value-added tax. A Baker might even have smelt that the FBI'S plan for Waco was madcap.
Mr Clinton has no such man. Mack McLarty, his chief of staff, seems to have imposed his will neither on the business of. generating ideas nor on working out how to implement them. Warren Christopher, the secretary of state, will stick to his last. Al Gore, the vice-president, seems to have a good working relationship with the president. But he cannot be a chief of staff; no president can run the risk of seeming to hand the reins of government over to his Number Two. By a similar token, the president cannot possibly rant more responsibility to his wife. This is not because she is unpopular. But there have been enough jokes about the Clintons for the president to avoid any suggestion that he cannot manage without her.
Without a real, head-knocking manager of his programme, the administration continues to live in something of a fool's paradise. The success that Mr Clinton made of his economic package--the speed with which Congress passed his deficit-reduction measures, the positive reaction in the markets--convinced too many that he would turn all he touched to gold. Yet this is, in many ways, a weak administration: supported by a minority vote last November, bereft of men and women as big as the president himself can be.
This would matter less if the rest of the year looked easy. It looks anything but. There is the snakepit of Bosnia; there is health care; there is an economy whose recovery suddenly looks fragile again. Mere ideas, however good, will not get Mr Clinton through that lot. In his second hundred days, he will have to discover how to turn his ideas into lasting achievements.","""This is an ideas battle...not every one of these thins can be distilled into politics--you know, who's for this and who's for that, and if this person is for this, somebody else has to be for that.

He claimed that Japan discriminated against American firms in its public-sector procurement practices, and announced that he was reviewing whether Japan had met the terms of a 1990 agreement with America to purchase supercomputers. He revealed too that he was examining the records of 16 countries, no less, and of the European Community, to see whether they granted adequate protection to the American holders of intellectual property rights. Mr Kantor's actions, as so often, raised eyebrows abroad, and reopened the question of whether the Clinton administration has a coherent trade policy. In fact, in a series of speeches and interviews in the first week in May, members of the administration have started to give an answer.
""Coherence"" in trade policy is an elusive quality, whether or not the president takes active charge of it. (With the exception of preparations last month for the visit of Kiichi Miyazawa, the prime minister of Japan, President Clinton has still not chaired a high-level meeting on the subject.) America's trade laws are fiendishly complex. They divide responsibility between Congress and a variety of federal agencies; they invest broad discretion in a variety of officers. Their bark is often worse than their bite. The only certain outcome of the April 30th announcements is a paperchase of bureaucratic meetings and interagency reviews: and high dudgeon abroad.
In theory, the administration could decide simply to ignore all the laws that give America unilateral power to impose sanctions on its trading partners. Yet even this could not grant total coherence, since many of the trade laws can be triggered by private companies or pressure groups. Mr Kantor, speaking as the lawyer he is, thinks that a policy of self-denial would bring the laws into disrepute. On May 4th, before a meeting of the Council of the Americas, he said that the only way he could build support for a system of open trade was to apply the laws that Congress had put in place, and to hold America's partners to agreements they have made. Hence the challenge to Japan on the supercomputer deal.
Carla Hills, George Bush's trade secretary, used to use language like this. It was she who spoke of using American law as a crowbar to open foreign markets, and who said that the administration, though it might not much like it, was nonetheless bound to apply the Super-301 trade-retaliation measure then on the statute book. The prepared texts of speeches by Mr Clinton and Mr Bush on trade policy are indistinguishable from each other. Mr Clinton talked tough to Mr Miyazawa last month about market access; but it was Mr Bush who took a group of America's most protectionist businessmen with him to Japan. Mr Kantor, before the Council of the Americas, gave a speech committing the administration to implementing a North American Free Trade Agreement by January 1st 1994; on the same day he set out the administration's determination to conclude the Uruguay round of the GATT December.
Why, then, is the administration so misunderstood? Part of the reason is that, off-the-cuff, Mr Kantor has not yet learned to speak the language of trade buffs. On May 4th he said in answer to a question, as he has implied before, that he was an ""agnostic"" on free trade, protectionism, managed trade or anything; all he wanted was an ""open world trading system"". That ""agnostic"", which sounded fair enough to Mr Kantor, could have carried an explosive charge across the oceans.
Foreign suspicion is also fuelled by reports that the administration is deeply divided on trade policy. Laura Tyson, the chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers, who is meant to be on the protectionist side of this debate, flatly denies this: those who believe it, she says, are living in a ""different reality"". Ms Tyson may protest too much; but she could certainly argue that at no time in the previous two administrations did everyone involved in trade policy sing from the same songbook. It is an error to rewrite history to pretend that they did.
How do members of the administration themselves think trade policy has changed? On May 4th, Mr Kantor have four examples. First, he said, the administration was more actively engaged in trade policy than the Bush people used to be. Second, he argued that Mr Clinton had tied trade policy to domestic economic policy directly. Third, he said that America's economic strength was its best security; and fourth, he said that America was now committed to leading the world to global growth.
Not much enlightenment there; the same reply could have been given at any time in the past four-years. But the previous day, when the same question was asked of Robert Rubin, who heads the National Economic Council in the White House, a rather different answer was given. The president, said Mr Rubin, believed that a ""two-way process"" was necessary to expand trade, and that he wanted to see ""measurable progress"" on the removal of formal or informal impediments to trade. So that the point would not be overlooked, Mr Rubin deliberately drew attention to the phrase ""measurable progress"".
A few days before, in an interview with The Economist, Ms Tyson had made precisely the same point. The administration's trade policy towards Japan, she said, was based on the idea that if it concluded trade agreements with the Japanese, it wanted measures of their success. She said that there was a variety of such measures. Sometimes the measure would be evidence that the Japanese had changed a regulation; sometimes that the number of distributors of foreign goods had grown, or the rate of acceptance of foreign bids for contracts. Sometimes, she continued, the appropriate measure would be the rate of growth in American exports of particular goods or the achievement of a certain market share.
Particular sectoral discussions, she continued, would carry with them their own specific measures. Ms Tyson has supported the Japanese-American semiconductor agreements, the last of which set a proposed share of part of the Japanese chip market of 20; she says that not all sectors should be treated to the ""market-share"" approach, but that the administration reserves the right to use it where appropriate.
Although there have doubtless been examples of such a ""results-oriented"" approach before--the semiconductor agreements were concluded by the Regan and Bush administrations--Ms Tyson's emphasis on the point is new. In traditional trade theory, rules set a framework within which the market, and not governments, determines what amounts of goods and services are sold in any territory. At the limit, it is difficult to see how an emphasis on measured results is consistent with multi-lateralism; it is not possible to imagine that the GATT could police hundreds of agreements, each with its own predetermined measure of success.
For that reason, when Ms Tyson claims that it is a ""terrible exaggeration"" to say that her approach amounts to managed trade, traditional free-traders, wedded to the advantages of multilateralism, will wonder what else it could be called. There will certainly be concern abroad that one measure in the administration's locker is the growth of American exports. What happened to the idea that America's power to open new markets was meant to bring benefits to all the world's traders?","On April 30th Mickey Kantor , President Clinton 's trade representative , announced a set of decisions under American trade laws . He claimed that Japan discriminated against American firms in its public - sector procurement practices , and announced that he was reviewing whether Japan had met the terms of a 1990 agreement with America to purchase supercomputers . He revealed too that he was examining the records of 16 countries , no less , and of the European Community , to see whether they granted adequate protection to the American holders of intellectual property rights . Mr Kantor 's actions , as so often , raised eyebrows abroad , and reopened the question of whether the Clinton administration has a coherent trade policy . In fact , in a series of speeches and interviews in the first week in May , members of the administration have started to give an answer . 
 "" Coherence "" in trade policy is an elusive quality , whether or not the president takes active charge of it . ( With the exception of preparations last month for the visit of Kiichi Miyazawa , President Clinton has still not chaired a high - level meeting on the subject . ) America 's trade laws are fiendishly complex . They divide responsibility between Congress and a variety of federal agencies ; they invest broad discretion in a variety of officers . Their bark is often worse than their bite . The only certain outcome of the April 30th announcements is a paperchase of bureaucratic meetings and interagency reviews : and high dudgeon abroad . 
 In theory , the administration could decide simply to ignore all the laws that give America unilateral power to impose sanctions on its trading partners . Yet even this could not grant total coherence , since many of the trade laws can be triggered by private companies or pressure groups . Mr Kantor , speaking as the lawyer he is , thinks that a policy of self - denial would bring the laws into disrepute . On May 4th , before a meeting of the Council of the Americas , he said that the only way he could build support for a system of open trade was to apply the laws that Congress had put in place , and to hold America 's partners to agreements they have made . Hence the challenge to Japan on the supercomputer deal . 
 Carla Hills , George Bush 's trade secretary , used to use language like this . It was she who spoke of using American law as a crowbar to open foreign markets , and who said that the administration , though it might not much like it , was nonetheless bound to apply the Super-301 trade - retaliation measure then on the statute book . The prepared texts of speeches by Mr Clinton and Mr Bush on trade policy are indistinguishable from each other . Mr Clinton talked tough to Kiichi Miyazawa last month about market access ; but it was Mr Bush who took a group of America 's most protectionist businessmen with him to Japan . Mr Kantor , before the Council of the Americas , gave a speech committing the administration to implementing a North American Free Trade Agreement by January 1st 1994 ; on the same day he set out the administration 's determination to conclude the Uruguay round of the GATT December . 
 Why , then , is the administration so misunderstood ? Part of the reason is that , off - the - cuff , Mr Kantor has not yet learned to speak the language of trade buffs . On May 4th he said in answer to a question , as he has implied before , that he was an "" agnostic "" on free trade , protectionism , managed trade or anything ; all he wanted was an "" open world trading system "" . That "" agnostic "" , which sounded fair enough to Mr Kantor , could have carried an explosive charge across the oceans .

No longer, it seems. The Clinton administration strongly believes in exerting such pressure. Its policy is to open some Japanese markets (which it deems to be closed) by setting import targets--an approach to trade policy that supporters call ""results-oriented"", This ugly term foreshadows uncertain consequences. Far from capitulating to this new thrust of American trade policy, Japan is taking a stand that could lead to a trans-Pacific confrontation.
Japan's government is deeply opposed to what America's trade representative, Mickey Kantor, has called a new policy geared to ""quantifiable results"" for some products. It fears that the demands and threats which are part of any such policy are bound to spread--both within product groups and to new areas of trade. At the summit meeting last month between Bill Clinton and Japan's prime minister, Kiichi Miyazawa, America insisted that Japan should come up with specific measures that would enable it to meet new import targets. Japan's government will refuse.
Instead, Japan is undertaking a detailed defence of its record on trade. This will first appear in the annual white paper on trade developments, due to be published on May 21st by the Ministry of International Trade and Industry (MITI)--its definitive statement on trade matters. In addition to the customary dry analysis, this year's edition will put Japan's side of an argument that has, until now, been dominated by American and European critiques. It follows another MITI report, published this week, that takes America, the European Community and other large trading partners to task for their ""unfair trading practices"". Both reports argue for trade governed by multilateral rules and call for the completion of the Uruguay round of trade talks.
Besides making worthy free-trade noises, MITI'S defence will also tackle American criticism head on. Naoyuki Haraoka, director of MITI'S international trade research office, is at pains to point out that Japan is in fact more open than other countries. Japan's average tariff on mining and manufactured goods is 2.7%, compared with 4.2% in America and 4.6% in the European Community. The report will also reject the argument that Japan needs special trade sanctions because it operates a different sort of capitalism. It will try to do so by explaining the nature and future of the country's trade surplus.
It is this persistent surplus, more than anything, that has provoked anger in Washington--and Mr Clinton's remark that ""the possibility of obtaining real, even access to the Japanese market is somewhat remote"". This year the surplus has been growing fast. Jesper Koll, a Tokyo-based economist at S.G. Warbur, estimates that Japan's trade surplus could reach $200 billion if the yen stays at current levels. That is $68 billion more than last year's figure. Moreover, the bilateral surplus with America is also growing rapidly. Mr Koll reckons it will climb from $44 billion in 1992 to $78 billion this year, an all-time high. With the economy still barely growing, despite two fiscal packages in the past nine months, Japan's critics say that the country is once more exporting its way out of recession.
One defence the ministry will make is that most trade statistics ignore services. MITI estimates, using data from the Bank of Japan, that if Japan's imports of services had been included in its trade statistics, then the trade surplus would have been $84 billion, $48 billion lower than reported. Exclusive attention to trade in goods is therefore misleading. MITI wants to see better collection of statistics for trade in services by international bodies such as the OECD.
SURPLUS, WHAT SURPLUS?
Analysis by Mr Haraoka's office explains the recent rise in Japan's trade surplus as follows: because of the recession at home, Japan has seen a decline in expensive imports of luxuries, which were enormously fashionable during the second half of the 1980s. This effect has been compounded, thanks to slow growth elsewhere, by low prices for the international commodities that Japanese industry depends upon. Exports of Japanese machinery, on the other hand, withstood the downturn quite well because the Asian economies that buy them continued to boom.
Also, the American and Japanese economies have been out of kilter. America's strengthening economy caused an increase in American demand for Japanese imports, while Japanese demand for foreign goods declined. The effect is amplified, MITI argues, because 35 of American exports to Japan are industrial commodities, which are highly sensitive to the business cycle.
Having argued that criticism of the trade surplus in Washington is misconceived, MITI's forthcoming paper goes on to predict that the surplus will, of its own accord, gradually diminish in size and relevance:
* When Japanese demand picks up again, imports will grow more quickly than in past recoveries. This is because the volume of Japanese imports has become more sensitive to the domestic economic cycle.
* Parts and components account for a growing share of Japan's exports; 28% of total exports and 36% of machinery exports in 1992 compared with 19% and 28% respectively in 1981. MITI believes that such exports should be of less concern to advocates of managed trade than consumer goods, because components increase the competitiveness--and therefore the export potential--of the industries that buy them. (Advocates of managed trade would doubtless dispute that.)
* From now on, MITI argues, Japans overseas plants will increasingly export their output back to Japan. Before, they bought Japanese exports of equipment and parts.
* Three years of declining profits have followed the over-investment of the late 1980s. Mr Haraoka predicts that Japanese managers will henceforth act more like Western managers, putting profits before their firms' market share. In the past, that is, Japanese firms have been export-driven; in future they will be less likely to export their way out of trouble.
For these reasons, MITI argues, Japan's trade surplus will fall in due course. However, it says, a persistent surplus (albeit a smaller one) is inevitable as long as Japanese households save more than American ones, and America's budget deficit remains untamed. This is a familiar point: trade balances are determined by macroeconomic factors, not by trade policy. To this, a sophisticated advocate of the import-target approach could reply that the balance is not the issue. What matters is access to Japan's markets; America would be content if Japan increased its imports and exports by the same amount (leaving the trade balance, and the associated accounting identities, undisturbed). This reply is disingenuous. American public opinion demands, in its unsophisticated way, a smaller trade deficit.
On trade and other issues, Japan has caved in to outside pressure countless times before, and may do so again. The White House seems to be counting on this. It, and Congress, would be better advised to concentrate on reducing America's budget deficit. That would reduce the trade deficit regardless of Japan's trade policies. Threats of trade reprisals, even if they force Japan to give way, will not.","Once when Japan faced pressure from abroad, it would either give in reluctantly or keep quiet and hope that the fuss would die down.

Public disapproval had brought about the resignation of the ruling Liberal Democratic Party's corrupt kingmaker, Shin Kanemaru. The LDP's unending grip on power seemed threatened by a collapse in the opinion polls. A rebel faction hinted it might leave the LDP, destroying the party's lower-house majority. A small opposition group called the Japan New Party was rising quickly in the polls by promising freshness and honesty. Socialist politicians seemed intent on forging a new unity and modernising their hard-left policies.
In recent weeks, however, disillusion has displaced optimism. ""The only hope is that a new party will emerge and change everything,"" says a typically frustrated businessman. Mr Kanemaru's arrest has not been followed by others. The government's opinion-poll rating has edged up, from 20.1% in November to 26.3% in May, according to polls conducted by Yomiuri Shimbun, Japan's biggest newspaper. The LDP's rebellious faction no loner looks like splitting off: on June 2nd one of its members said secession would achieve nothing, and that the best way to bring about reform was to work behind the scenes.
Why are the reformers now retreating? Partly because one of the leading LDP rebels, Ichiro Ozawa, rose on Mr Kanemaru's coat tails. His patron's arrest on charges of tax evasion suggests Mr Ozawa should not risk angering the tax authorities, or their friends. Kiichi Miyazawa, the prime minister, used to work in the finance ministry, which oversees the tax office.
At the same time, the opposition's appeal to would-be LDP secessionists is waning. The Social Democratic Party and the Clean Government Party, Japan's two biggest opposition parties, have both failed to use the LDP'S disarray to improve their own poll ratings. The Japan New Party's support rose from 0.5% in September last year to 5.646 in April, according to Yomiuri Shimbun polls. It slipped back to 4.2% in May, perhaps because of the party's failure to offer new policies, perhaps because of reports of the party leader's dalliances.
Yet, although the reformers have been floundering, the chances of reform suddenly look better than ever. Powerful people, as Japan's subtle politicians know, stay powerful by bending to others' wishes. The LDP'S mainstream has been quietly promoting change, and more than half its Diet (parliamentary) members recently signed a petition in favour of political reform.
So it is that the prospects for four political-reform bills are suddenly looking good. Three of them propose rules to make political bribery more difficult. The fourth would change Japan's electoral system. At present several candidates are elected in each constituency. This discourages campaigns based on party policy; usually the main contenders are all Liberal Democrats.
The LDP'S previous proposal for voting reform was to replace the Japanese system with a first-past-the-post system. That would have given it around 90% of seats in the lower house and, since the opposition would never accept that prospect, the bill seemed destined for the dustbin.
But on May 28th the Liberal Democrats put forward proposals that the opposition might swallow, because they would preserve the current balance of power. One idea is to revive a bill put forward in 1991, in the wake of a previous corruption scandal. This envisaged 300 first-past-the-post seats plus 175 that would be filled by proportional representation. The opposition has proposed something similar, so the stage is set for compromise.
The current Diet session is due to end on June 20th, which leaves little time for the horse-trading that will be necessary. Some talk of extending it until the Group of Seven summit in Tokyo in early July; others favour calling an extraordinary session in September. Either way, however, politicians of both rebellious and conservative sorts say some kind of reform is likely to be enacted.
The staunchest opponents of reform strike a revealing pose: rather than argue against it, they seek to undermine it by espousing an extreme version. Even they do not believe the issue will just evaporate. If the politicians flunk change this time, the issue of electoral reform will return to haunt them.

This is the old law of Japanese politics, but on June 15th it was turned upside down. The bosses of the governing Liberal Democratic Party admitted that, despite more than a week of discussions, they had failed to unite around a new electoral-reform proposal. Japan's opposition parties, by contrast, had signed their names to a reform bill two weeks earlier.
This is bad news for Japan's political system, and for the prime minister, Kiichi Miyazawa. For the past three months, he has been saying that his party must push through reform or lose the public's confidence. This had already been mislaid last year, when a new wave of scandals revealed the extent of the party's bribe-taking and links with gangsters. Shin Kanemaru, the party's kingmaker and allegedly bribe-taker-in-chief, was arrested in March; gold bars were found in his office.
Electoral reform was intended to atone for these embarrassments; Japan's multi-member electoral constituencies are thought to discourage debate and encourage graft. But most Liberal Democratic folk resist changing the system that put them in office. As a result, they rallied around wildly radical reforms unacceptable to the opposition, which fears the plan would cost them many seats in the Diet (parliament). This was intended to please voters with the semblance of reformist zeal, while blocking real change. Mr Miyazawa's hopes of winning approval for reform during this session of the Diet have thus been thwarted: the session ends on June 20th.
Artificial zeal may not impress the voters. A poll published on June 15th suggested that 81.6% of Japanese thought the cabinet should resin or parliament should be dissolved if a reform compromise eluded it. The government's popularity will not have been helped by a survey that appeared on the same day, showing the suspicious wealth of Liberal Democratic politicians.
This found that the average Liberal Democratic respondent admitted to assets of Y132m ($1.2m), about three times the average for opposition politicians and twice that of the average Japanese family. The politicians are probably even richer than they say; the figures exclude assets held in the name of members of their families.
The voters will soon have their say, in elections for the Tokyo Metropolitan Assembly this month, and then in a general election that must be held by February. Mr Miyazawa's more immediate discomfort is caused by fellow politicians. A dissident Liberal Democratic faction headed by Tsutomu Hata supports reforms and has threatened to join the opposition if it is frustrated. On the day the party gave up on reform Masaharu Gotoda, who is the deputy prime minister and not usually a rebel, criticised his boss for ducking the reform challenge. Supporters and opponents of reform resorted briefly to fisticuffs.
As The Economist went to press, the mettle of the pro-reform gang was about to be tested. Three opposition parties had tabled a motion of no confidence in the government. If this were passed the cabinet would have to resign or call an election. By supporting the no-confidence motion the Hata faction could bring about the downfall of the government. Even if Mr Miyazawa escapes that fate, his reputation is going to be badly damaged. The G7 world economic summit will be held in Tokyo on July 7th-9th. Mr Miyazawa longed to look like a statesman then, not like a discredited weakling.
With their economy in the dumps and the Clinton administration demanding access to their markets, the Japanese want more decisive government. Even so, Mr Miyazawa's career cannot be written off entirely. He may salvage part of his reformist image by promising to continue discussion of electoral reform, perhaps in a special session of the Diet later in the summer. More important, Mr Miyazawa has no strong rivals. The chief contender for his job is unwell. For the prime minister to survive this week's happenings would be extraordinary. But extraordinary things do happen in Japanese politics.","The opposition is meant to be divided ; the ruling party rules because it acts more or less as one .

On the day the party gave up on reform Masaharu Gotoda , who is the deputy prime minister and not usually a rebel , criticised Kiichi Miyazawa's for ducking the reform challenge . Supporters and opponents of reform resorted briefly to fisticuffs . 
 As Kiichi Miyazawa went to press , the mettle of the pro - reform gang was about to be tested . Three opposition parties had tabled a motion of no confidence in the government . If this were passed the cabinet would have to resign or call an election . By supporting the no - confidence motion the Hata faction could bring about the downfall of the government . Even if Kiichi Miyazawa escapes that fate , Kiichi Miyazawa's reputation is going to be badly damaged . The G7 world economic summit will be held in Tokyo on July 7th-9th . Kiichi Miyazawa longed to look like a statesman then , not like a discredited weakling . 
 With their economy in the dumps and the Clinton administration demanding access to their markets , the Japanese want more decisive government . Even so , Kiichi Miyazawa's career can not be written off entirely . Kiichi Miyazawa may salvage part of Kiichi Miyazawa's reformist image by promising to continue discussion of electoral reform , perhaps in a special session of the Diet later in the summer .

In its exquisite politeness, just as in its phenomenal economic success and its incomprehensible politics, Japan has long seemed different from all other countries. Now Mr Hata and his rebels have blown a hole in one of the main features of Japanese distinctiveness: a political system that has kept the Liberal Democratic Party in power for 38 unbroken years (see page 33).
Some Japanese compare the LDP's collapse to the fall of the Berlin Wall. At first glance that claim looks excessive. The Japanese rebels are not veteran dissidents like the anti-communists who helped free Eastern Europe. Mr Hata, though seen as a strange and interesting figure in Japanese politics because he held down a proper job for ten years, is a former LDP finance and agriculture minister. And Ichiro Ozawa, the rebels' behind-the-scenes leader, is a political fixer much like the faction heads who have pulled the political strings for the past four decades. He learnt his politics from two master-manipulators, Kakuei Tanaka, a prime minister in the 1970s, and Shin Kanemaru, the LDP godfather whose shame and scandal brought on the calls for reform that precipitated this crisis.
Yet a revolution may indeed be taking place in Japan. First, the LDP'S dominion is probably over. Second, and more important, the politics of Japan is changing because the people of Japan are changing (see pages 21-23). Mr Hata has emerged from the backrooms to go on chat shows and offer his vision of the future not because he has undergone a religious conversion but because he senses that this is what voters want. Influenced by his impressions, as a tourist or peripatetic businessman, of more open political systems elsewhere; hungry for political standards to match Japan's economic ones; disillusioned with government-by-bureaucrat after the recent popping of Japan's ""bubble economy"": the man in the noodle bar thinks he has subordinated his own interests to those of company and government for long enough.
In the immediate future, Japanese politics will probably look messy. An election is to be held on July 18th. The LDP, now splintering, is unlikely to win an overall majority. The Social Democratic Party, the next-largest, still struggling to rid itself of some policies so passe they would embarrass an Albanian communist, does not yet look like a plausible government. So after the election the backrooms will probably fill up again, coalitions may form and collapse, and the Japanese may well start to reminisce about the stability of the good old LDP days. While the politicians scramble, the bureaucrats will appear to be more in control than ever.
But such disorder will be the precursor to a new order. The campaign for political reform is set to continue and eventually succeed. Mr Miyazawa fell because he failed to back bills on party-finance and electoral reform, intended to clean up Japanese politics. Any new government will be under pressure to push ahead with those.
In time, the break-up of the monolithic LDP and the opening up of politics will accelerate the change that lies behind that opening up. As Japanese voters express their demands more openly, so their politicians will reflect their interests more clearly. That is likely to lead to a spread of influence away from the few who manipulated the old system towards the many who will have better access to the new one.
The balance of power is likely to shift in two ways, at least--from the countryside to the towns, and from producers to consumers. Rural voters currently have up to three times as much weight in elections as urban ones, which helps explain why city taxpayers subsidise their country cousins. Mr Hata and the other rebels draw their support mainly from the towns.
SOME COSTS, MORE BENEFITS
The protection that farmers have enjoyed, through subsidies and a virtual ban on rice imports, amounts both to a bias in favour of the countryside and a raw deal for Japanese consumers. Japan is enmeshed in red tape that helps producers--ranging from safety rules that make drivers change their cars every couple of years, to a system of planning permits that has let shopkeepers drive away big, cost-cutting stores. A political system that responds more to voters' demands will make markets work more in the interests of consumers. (True, the European Community's common agricultural policy offers lousy proof that western-style democracy serves the interests of consumers; but, in Japan, more open politics will shift the balance of influence in that direction.)
Are there then no costs in losing a system that has presided over such dramatic economic success? Few changes are free of any cost. Unity and consensus have given Japan a steadiness of policy that has served it well since the 1950s. Japan's post-war economic performance, built upon social cohesion and political continuity, has been strikingly more successful than that of countries such as Britain, which pride themselves on confrontational systems of government. As Japan takes up political debate and even disputation, it will sacrifice some of the force of its single-mindedness.
But overall it will gain. Consensus and discipline are fine virtues in vehicle-assembly plants, where almost everybody works to a preordained plan. Such factories, however, will count for less and less of Japanese economic output, as the yen rises and manufacturing shifts to cheaper parts of the world. Increasingly, the Japanese will need to produce goods and services that require irreverent imagination and individual initiative. Firms trying to dream up new kinds of financial derivatives need employees who are inventive rather than obedient.
For the outside world, the change in Japanese politics comes as good news. The United States is increasingly irritated by Japan's failure to buy more American goods, and is increasingly open about that irritation. This argument threatens the world. Japan's more powerful consumers should be useful allies for the Americans. America would do well to befriend changing Japan, rather than antagonise it.
Japan may also start to play a bigger role abroad. Its old politicians looked uncomfortable prancing on the world stage with their publicity-conscious counterparts. Japan's voters now take a different view. Although involvement in places like Cambodia makes them nervous, they are delighted when their leaders hobnob with American presidents, or the country holds a grand international jamboree--such as the awkwardly timed G7 meeting scheduled for July. Mr Hata, probably the next prime minister, has said that political reform ""will help Japan to develop a more independent foreign policy and to take diplomatic initiatives."" In the loom of its uncertainties, the world can welcome such a new light shining in Japan.","About to lead a rebellion designed to split his own party and bring down the government , Tsutomu Hata turned to Kiichi Miyazawa on June 18th and , without irony , bowed .

He belonged until recently to the biggest faction of Japan's biggest party, which gave him a decent chance to amass influence and campaign funds. His specialist area of influence-peddling is the environment, and in 1992 he organised an eminent persons' colloquium on greenery. He persuaded Noboru Takeshita, an ex-prime minister and the boss of Mr Aichi's faction, to attend as Japan's eminence. But in two days of meetings Mr Takeshita said nothing at all.
This, says Mr Aichi, came as a formative shock. The, reluctance to express opinions is a traditional Japanese virtue. The country's intellectual history is dominated not by great conceptual thinkers, but by the obscure parables of Zen Buddhism; indeed, Zen teaches its disciples to rid the mind of thought. Opinionated Japanese are often regarded as brash and unreliable; their egoism threatens their country's prized consensus. Yet Mr Takeshita's reticence, however suitable among fellow Japanese, made him look an idiot in international company.
So Mr Aichi resolved to push for more outspoken politics. In December he joined a band of rebels that split from the Takeshita faction, proclaiming a new movement called Reform Forum 21. On June 18th this group brought down Japan's government. The prime minister, Kiichi Miyazawa, had backed away from plans to reform Japan's election system. Mr Aichi and his friends supported an opposition no-confidence motion. Then they marched out of the Liberal Democratic Party, so ending four decades in which it had ruled virtually unchallenged.
The election that will follow next month will not immediately bring about a new kind of politics; corrupt pork-barrelling may, as usual, be more evident than the policy-based campaigning that Mr Aichi wants. Though the odds are against it, the Liberal Democrats' electoral machine may keep them in office, perhaps through a coalition. But the forces that have driven Mr Aichi will in the end transform Japan's politics. The nation's multiplying contacts with other countries--trade negotiations, G7 summits, talks on UN peace-keeping--are placing new demands upon its politicians. As a result, the politicians will change.
INTERNATIONAL REVOLUTION
This will mark a new stage in Japan's long apprenticeship with the West. In the mid-19th century, the country emerged from 200 years of near isolation and rushed to copy the industrial revolutions of America and Europe. The government dispatched experts abroad to report on steel and railway engines, schooling and bureaucracy. In the ensuing half century, Japan joined the world's foremost economies. But the experts were selective. They had orders to bring home western techniques and technologies, not western liberalism, individualism or similar ideas. ""Japanese spirit, western knowledge"" was the slogan of the period.
In the 1980s, however, this pattern of selective learning from foreigners was reversed. Western companies rushed to copy their more successful Japanese rivals: in techniques and technologies, the apprentice turned master. At the same time, the dramatic rise of the yen from the middle of the decade opened Japan to the social and political examples that the 19th-century leaders had deliberately excluded. Though nobody proclaimed such a slogan, ""Japanese knowledge, western spirit"" summed up what was going on.
Tokyo suddenly became an international financial centre: conservative Japanese bankers began to share their lunch bars with loud-tied people from London and New York. The strong yen vastly increased Japan's capacity to buy imports, so the foreign financiers were joined by teams of salesmen from all manner of western firms. In the five years to 1990, the number of legal foreign residents in Japan jumped 26% to 1.1m. All in all, the total number of visitors (residents plus short-termers) rose by 39% to 3.2m in 1990.
The strong yen also encouraged the Japanese to go abroad. In 1985 1.5m Japanese visited America; in 1990 3.2m went. (That excludes holiday trips to Guam and Hawaii, whose numbers rose from 1.2m to 2.1m.) Visits to Europe jumped from 2.3m to 5.1m over the period. The travellers included a growing number leaving home to study: 24,000 did so in 1985, 122,000 in 1990. Japanese businessmen charged abroad too, buying properties, building factories.
Since 1990 travel has continued to expand, and the yen's renewed rise this year will further boost this revolution in international contact. Most Japanese seem to relish it. Opinion polls show that the Japanese want more international exchange; and the government is committed to improving school children's ability in spoken English. For those who have already left school, Tokyo's subway system is full of advertisements for English lessons.
As more and more ordinary Japanese rub shoulders with foreigners, the country's rulers can no longer screen foreign influence. The carefully selective exposure of old has been replaced by thousands of undirected contacts. Until the government's collapse this month, the resulting change seemed more social than political. But social shifts are bound to work through into politics.
Take, for example, the effect of foreign firms' increased presence in Japan. A decade ago, most students at top universities would not consider a job with a foreign securities house or computer firm; this is changing rapidly. Working for foreigners means accepting western work practices rather than traditional Japanese ones.
Western firms tend to hold individual employees responsible for decisions; Japanese companies favour decision by consensus, with responsibility shared around. Responsibility means opportunity: in a western firm, the employee who performs well can hope for quick promotion. Japanese firms, by contrast, traditionally believe in promotion by age as much as merit. Responsibility also means risk: western companies are far quicker to fire people.
STRONGER YEN, STRONGER OPINIONS
Thus western companies are encouraging new attitudes: more individualism, more risk, less paternalism. As a result, Japan's conception of merit is changing. In the days of consensus and slow promotion by age, disciplined loyalty to the firm was rewarded handsomely. These days, by contrast, initiative and originality are rising in value.
As their contact with foreign firms increases, Japanese firms are adopting western practices, so the effect on attitudes is multiplied. Hence the rowing popularity of business degrees, which foster prima donna managers. Five years ago only one Japanese university offered MBAs; four more have since started to do so.
Admiration For individualism is spreading beyond the business world. Artists have abandoned respectful study at the feet of older masters in favour of free-wheeling iconoclasm. Women are gradually challenging men's traditional status. More Japanese are defying the authority of the law: the number of reported crimes jumped 10.4% in the five years to 1992. One of today's most popular youth heroes is Malcolm X, a hoodlum turned radical civil-rights campaigner.
What might these shifts mean for politics? Japan's rulers are old; but western influence has undermined respect for age. The rulers practise slow, consensual decisionmaking; but consensus is no longer preferred to personal initiative. They shrink from expressing their views clearly; but Japan is acquiring a western taste for articulate leaders with vision. Small wonder that many Japanese hold their politicians in contempt. Japan's aged rulers, like the silent Mr Takeshita, no longer represent their country.
Instead, the Japanese want confident spokesmen. An early sign of this came in 1986, soon after the strengthening yen began to strengthen Japanese opinions. In that year Yasuhiro Nakasone led the Liberal Democrats to a landslide election victory. Mr Nakasone had made himself popular by talking straight at meetings with foreign leaders. This won the respect of Ronald Reagan. For an American president, popularity in Japan could well be regarded as a handicap. For Mr Nakasone, there was huge domestic advantage in the Yasu-Ron relationship.
Pressure from the electorate is not the only force for a new politics, as the fall of the government this month has shown. Pressure also comes from within the ruling establishment-from politicians like Mr Aichi and, less visibly but equally importantly, from bureaucrats and business chiefs. The reason, again, lies in international contact.
As Japan's share of the world economy rises with the yen, so foreign demands on Japan grow more insistent. Japan is required to restrict exports, stimulate imports, contribute to UN peace-keeping, support the environment, pay for Boris Yeltsin. It cannot say Yes to everybody; it needs politicians who can negotiate toughly in committee rooms and defend Japan's position charmingly to critical outsiders.
Over the past half year Japan has felt this need acutely. In the month or two after his election, Bill Clinton was a popular hero in Japan: his youth and energy delighted the younger, internationalist Japanese who despair of their own politicians. It was all the more galling to Japan's leaders, therefore, when Mr Clinton rounded on them.
NO MEANS YES
The new president seemed ready, if necessary, to prise open Japanese markets with sanctions. He was determined to help Mr Yeltsin, despite Japan's policy of blocking aid until the Russians moved towards returning the northerly Kurile islands. At a summit with Mr Yeltsin in Vancouver in April, Mr Clinton let slip what he thought of Japanese objections. When the Japanese say No they sometimes mean Yes, was the American president's advice to Mr Yeltsin.
Japan's recently humbled prime minister, Kiichi Miyazawa, failed to live up to the Clinton challenge. He is clever and speaks English; when he met Mr Clinton in April the two had a fine discussion. In the press conference afterwards, however, the president attacked ""Japan's growing global imbalances and inadequate market access"", and said he would not ""paper over"" the two countries' differences. Mr Miyazawa was forced on to the defensive. He and the president, he ventured not very convincingly, had established a feeling of mutual trust.
Not that Japan is incapable of fighting. Japanese officials decry the Clinton team's appetite for ""managed trade"" as a departure from the free-trade principles of the GATT. In briefings and policy papers, they present a skilful defence of Japan's efforts to open up to exports. But their case is harmed by their politicians' sluggishness. A headline-grabbing promise to open Japan's rice market, for example, would have undermined the country's critics--even if, as with many western promises, deeds later proved a long time coming. Though he knows that the rice market must eventually be opened, Mr Miyazawa has shrunk from such bold action.
Nor has Japan headed off American trade demands by proving itself a worthy partner in non-trade matters. The issue of aid to Russia presented a chance to do this last spring; but the opportunity was fumbled. Japan convened a special summit of G7 ministers in Tokyo, at which it promised Mr Yeltsin $1.8 billion. But it did so belatedly, only after other G7 countries had bullied it into action. As in the Gulf war, when most of Japan's contribution was approved by the Diet (parliament) only after the fighting had ended, Japan appeared grudging. Faster action might have made Japan look like the champion of Russian aid, not like a churlish sugar daddy.
The resulting damage to Japan's standing in the world affects more than its ability to protect its trade interests. Japanese pride is wounded too. Multiplying contacts with the outside world have multiplied the urge to be respected by it. Besides, Japan's wealth has brought aspiration to political and diplomatic superpowerdom. Since Japan is increasingly asked to pay for world initiatives, it naturally feels it deserves an increasing share of the credit for them. The clearest mark of this new status would be a permanent seat for Japan on the United Nations Security Council, an idea which the Clinton team is backing.
Pending that prize, Japan views its participation in other international bodies with the utmost seriousness. July's G7 summit in Tokyo has preoccupied Tokyo's wise grey heads for months beforehand. It was to have been a chance to demonstrate Japan's aptitude for international leadership. Sadly, the host will have just demonstrated his inability to lead his own government.
Pride and self-interest in international affairs, therefore, demand stronger political leadership. The demands are reinforced by changes within Japan. The government's task at home has grown harder. From the 1950s until the 1980s, Japan suspended debate on foreign policy and defence by handing these tricky matters over to the Americans. Meanwhile, economic policy was focused on the single-minded pursuit of growth through exports.
Now things are different. America's military protection is no longer taken for granted; its diplomatic lead is often resented. This prompts plenty of alarming questions, such as how Japan should deal with the security threats from North Korea and China. On the economic front, there are calls to balance the pursuit of growth with other goals: shorter working hours, more environmental sensitivity, more personal consumption. Within the growth-seeking camp, a split has opened up between international firms that depend on free trade and domestically focused ones that depend on protectionism. In short, Japan's famous consensus has vanished.
For these reasons, a profound change is under way among Japan's powerful bureaucrats. They once delighted in ineffectual government, since it left them in charge of the country. Nowadays, they admit that wise mandarins cannot run Japan any more; they need a politician's dash and nerve if their wisdom is to be implemented.
Take the UN effort in Cambodia. To support its claim to be taken seriously in the world, Japan has done much to help this. It gave more money to the operation than any other country, which helps to explain why Cambodia has gone better than most UN projects. More remarkably, Japan stretched the interpretation of its pacifist constitution to allow its soldiers to participate. Bureaucrats alone could never have broken the pacifist taboo, says one Japanese diplomat; it took a politician to shove the idea through the Diet. By no coincidence, the man who did the shoving was Ichiro Ozawa, the ruling party's secretary-general at the time--and now a leading figure in Mr Aichi's rebel faction.
WILL ANYTHING HAPPEN?
Business leaders, bureaucrats and ordinary Japanese all want bolder politics. Even after this month's drama, however, many still laugh at the idea that their wish might be granted. The absence of policy debate is built into Japan's multi-member constituency system. In elections, rival candidates from each party compete against one another, which makes it pointless to campaign on the basis of the party's policy. Instead, candidates buy votes. This in turn forces them to devote the periods between election campaigns to lobbying on behalf of rich backers, rather than arguing about policies.
The hope of change has been raised before, only to be disappointed. Since the 1970s, several corruption scandals have been followed by promises to curb money politics, all of which proved empty. In 1991 Toshiki Kaifu, the prime minister of the time, vowed to reform the electoral system in a way that would promote open debate on the questions facing post-consensus Japan. His party promptly ditched him.
This time, however, politics does seem to be changing. Two years after Mr Kaifu's departure, his successor has fallen for the opposite reason: Mr Miyazawa failed to back electoral reform boldly. This failure alienated just about everyone outside his own band of cronies. The most generous opinion polls suggested that a quarter of Japanese supported him; others put the proportion at around a tenth. Bureaucrats have been privately saying that, to deserve a permanent place on the UN Security Council, Japan needed stronger leadership.
A few days before Mr Miyazawa's fall, Takeshi Nagano, president of the Federation of Employers' Associations, predicted that the ruling party would lose the next election if it shelved political reform--a remarkable statement, given the Liberal Democrats' four decades in office. He added that he would not regret this. Business leaders traditionally pay for the ruling party. This time their exasperation with politics has boiled over.
By itself, Mr Miyazawa's fall will not change the quality of Japan's politics. The next government is likely to be an unstable coalition. Even if it does push through the electoral reform that Mr Miyazawa balked at, Japan's politicians will not be transformed into policy gurus overnight. Yet the coalition of bureaucrats, businessmen and dissident politicians that got rid of Mr Miyazawa represents a powerful force for change. So does the shift in attitudes that lies behind this coalition. As Japan's internationalisation continues, those attitudes will shift further.","Kazuo Aichi is an ordinary sort of Japanese politician .

 The strong yen also encouraged the Japanese to go abroad . In 1985 1.5 m Japanese visited America ; in 1990 3.2 m went . ( That excludes holiday trips to Guam and Hawaii , whose numbers rose from 1.2 m to 2.1 m. ) Visits to Europe jumped from 2.3 m to 5.1 m over the period . The travellers included a growing number leaving home to study : 24,000 did so in 1985 , 122,000 in 1990 . Japanese businessmen charged abroad too , buying properties , building factories . 
 Since 1990 travel has continued to expand , and the yen 's renewed rise this year will further boost this revolution in international contact . Most Japanese seem to relish it . Opinion polls show that the Japanese want more international exchange ; and the government is committed to improving school children 's ability in spoken English . For those who have already left school , Tokyo 's subway system is full of advertisements for English lessons . 
 As more and more ordinary Japanese rub shoulders with foreigners , the country 's rulers can no longer screen foreign influence . The carefully selective exposure of old has been replaced by thousands of undirected contacts . Until the government 's collapse this month , the resulting change seemed more social than political . But social shifts are bound to work through into politics . 
 Take , for example , the effect of foreign firms ' increased presence in Japan . A decade ago , most students at top universities would not consider a job with a foreign securities house or computer firm ; this is changing rapidly . Working for foreigners means accepting western work practices rather than traditional Japanese ones . 
 Western firms tend to hold individual employees responsible for decisions ; Japanese companies favour decision by consensus , with responsibility shared around . Responsibility means opportunity : in a western firm , the employee who performs well can hope for quick promotion . Japanese firms , by contrast , traditionally believe in promotion by age as much as merit . Responsibility also means risk : western companies are far quicker to fire people . 
 STRONGER YEN , STRONGER OPINIONS 
 Thus western companies are encouraging new attitudes : more individualism , more risk , less paternalism . As a result , Japan 's conception of merit is changing . In the days of consensus and slow promotion by age , disciplined loyalty to the firm was rewarded handsomely . These days , by contrast , initiative and originality are rising in value . 
 As their contact with foreign firms increases , Japanese firms are adopting western practices , so the effect on attitudes is multiplied . Hence the rowing popularity of business degrees , which foster prima donna managers . Five years ago only one Japanese university offered MBAs ; four more have since started to do so . 
 Admiration For individualism is spreading beyond the business world . Artists have abandoned respectful study at the feet of older masters in favour of free - wheeling iconoclasm . Women are gradually challenging men 's traditional status . More Japanese are defying the authority of the law : the number of reported crimes jumped 10.4 % in the five years to 1992 . One of today 's most popular youth heroes is Malcolm X , a hoodlum turned radical civil - rights campaigner . 
 What might these shifts mean for politics ? Japan 's rulers are old ; but western influence has undermined respect for age . The rulers practise slow , consensual decisionmaking ; but consensus is no longer preferred to personal initiative . They shrink from expressing their views clearly ; but Japan is acquiring a western taste for articulate leaders with vision . Small wonder that many Japanese hold their politicians in contempt . Japan 's aged rulers , like the silent Mr Takeshita , no longer represent their country . 
 Instead , the Japanese want confident spokesmen . An early sign of this came in 1986 , soon after the strengthening yen began to strengthen Japanese opinions . In that year Yasuhiro Nakasone led the Liberal Democrats to a landslide election victory . Mr Nakasone had made himself popular by talking straight at meetings with foreign leaders . This won the respect of Ronald Reagan . For an American president , popularity in Japan could well be regarded as a handicap . For Mr Nakasone , there was huge domestic advantage in the Yasu - Ron relationship . 
 Pressure from the electorate is not the only force for a new politics , as the fall of the government this month has shown . Pressure also comes from within the ruling establishment - from politicians like Mr Aichi and , less visibly but equally importantly , from bureaucrats and business chiefs . The reason , again , lies in international contact . 
 As Japan 's share of the world economy rises with the yen , so foreign demands on Japan grow more insistent . Japan is required to restrict exports , stimulate imports , contribute to UN peace - keeping , support the environment , pay for Boris Yeltsin . It can not say Yes to everybody ; it needs politicians who can negotiate toughly in committee rooms and defend Japan 's position charmingly to critical outsiders . 
 Over the past half year Japan has felt this need acutely . In the month or two after his election , Bill Clinton was a popular hero in Japan : his youth and energy delighted the younger , internationalist Japanese who despair of their own politicians . It was all the more galling to Japan 's leaders , therefore , when Mr Clinton rounded on them . 
 NO MEANS YES 
 The new president seemed ready , if necessary , to prise open Japanese markets with sanctions . He was determined to help Mr Yeltsin , despite Japan 's policy of blocking aid until the Russians moved towards returning the northerly Kurile islands . At a summit with Mr Yeltsin in Vancouver in April , Mr Clinton let slip what he thought of Japanese objections . When the Japanese say No they sometimes mean Yes , was the American president 's advice to Mr Yeltsin . 
 Japan 's recently humbled prime minister , Kiichi Miyazawa , failed to live up to the Clinton challenge . He is clever and speaks English ; when he met Mr Clinton in April the two had a fine discussion . In the press conference afterwards , however , the president attacked "" Japan 's growing global imbalances and inadequate market access "" , and said he would not "" paper over "" the two countries ' differences . Mr Miyazawa was forced on to the defensive . He and the president , he ventured not very convincingly , had established a feeling of mutual trust . 
 Not that Japan is incapable of fighting . Japanese officials decry the Clinton team 's appetite for "" managed trade "" as a departure from the free - trade principles of the GATT . In briefings and policy papers , they present a skilful defence of Japan 's efforts to open up to exports . But their case is harmed by their politicians ' sluggishness . A headline - grabbing promise to open Japan 's rice market , for example , would have undermined the country 's critics -- even if , as with many western promises , deeds later proved a long time coming . Though he knows that the rice market must eventually be opened , Mr Miyazawa has shrunk from such bold action . 
 Nor has Japan headed off American trade demands by proving itself a worthy partner in non - trade matters . The issue of aid to Russia presented a chance to do this last spring ; but the opportunity was fumbled . Japan convened a special summit of G7 ministers in Tokyo , at which it promised Mr Yeltsin $ 1.8 billion . But it did so belatedly , only after other G7 countries had bullied it into action . As in the Gulf war , when most of Japan 's contribution was approved by the Diet ( parliament ) only after the fighting had ended , Japan appeared grudging . Faster action might have made Japan look like the champion of Russian aid , not like a churlish sugar daddy . 
 The resulting damage to Japan 's standing in the world affects more than its ability to protect its trade interests . Japanese pride is wounded too . Multiplying contacts with the outside world have multiplied the urge to be respected by it . Besides , Japan 's wealth has brought aspiration to political and diplomatic superpowerdom . Since Japan is increasingly asked to pay for world initiatives , it naturally feels it deserves an increasing share of the credit for them . The clearest mark of this new status would be a permanent seat for Japan on the United Nations Security Council , an idea which the Clinton team is backing . 
 Pending that prize , Japan views its participation in other international bodies with the utmost seriousness . July 's G7 summit in Tokyo has preoccupied Tokyo 's wise grey heads for months beforehand . It was to have been a chance to demonstrate Japan 's aptitude for international leadership . Sadly , the host will have just demonstrated his inability to lead his own government . 
 Pride and self - interest in international affairs , therefore , demand stronger political leadership . The demands are reinforced by changes within Japan . The government 's task at home has grown harder . From the 1950s until the 1980s , Japan suspended debate on foreign policy and defence by handing these tricky matters over to the Americans . Meanwhile , economic policy was focused on the single - minded pursuit of growth through exports . 
 Now things are different . America 's military protection is no longer taken for granted ; its diplomatic lead is often resented . This prompts plenty of alarming questions , such as how Japan should deal with the security threats from North Korea and China . On the economic front , there are calls to balance the pursuit of growth with other goals : shorter working hours , more environmental sensitivity , more personal consumption . Within the growth - seeking camp , a split has opened up between international firms that depend on free trade and domestically focused ones that depend on protectionism . In short , Japan 's famous consensus has vanished . 
 For these reasons , a profound change is under way among Japan 's powerful bureaucrats . They once delighted in ineffectual government , since it left them in charge of the country . Nowadays , they admit that wise mandarins can not run Japan any more ; they need a politician 's dash and nerve if their wisdom is to be implemented . 
 Take the UN effort in Cambodia . To support its claim to be taken seriously in the world , Japan has done much to help this . It gave more money to the operation than any other country , which helps to explain why Cambodia has gone better than most UN projects . More remarkably , Japan stretched the interpretation of its pacifist constitution to allow its soldiers to participate . Bureaucrats alone could never have broken the pacifist taboo , says one Japanese diplomat ; it took a politician to shove the idea through the Diet . By no coincidence , the man who did the shoving was Ichiro Ozawa , the ruling party 's secretary - general at the time -- and now a leading figure in Mr Aichi 's rebel faction . 
 WILL ANYTHING HAPPEN ? 
 Business leaders , bureaucrats and ordinary Japanese all want bolder politics . Even after this month 's drama , however , many still laugh at the idea that their wish might be granted . The absence of policy debate is built into Japan 's multi - member constituency system . In elections , rival candidates from each party compete against one another , which makes it pointless to campaign on the basis of the party 's policy . Instead , candidates buy votes . This in turn forces them to devote the periods between election campaigns to lobbying on behalf of rich backers , rather than arguing about policies . 
 The hope of change has been raised before , only to be disappointed . Since the 1970s , several corruption scandals have been followed by promises to curb money politics , all of which proved empty . In 1991 Toshiki Kaifu , the prime minister of the time , vowed to reform the electoral system in a way that would promote open debate on the questions facing post - consensus Japan . His party promptly ditched him . 
 This time , however , politics does seem to be changing . Two years after Mr Kaifu 's departure , his successor has fallen for the opposite reason : Mr Miyazawa failed to back electoral reform boldly . This failure alienated just about everyone outside his own band of cronies . The most generous opinion polls suggested that a quarter of Japanese supported him ; others put the proportion at around a tenth . Bureaucrats have been privately saying that , to deserve a permanent place on the UN Security Council , Japan needed stronger leadership . 
 A few days before Mr Miyazawa 's fall , Takeshi Nagano , president of the Federation of Employers ' Associations , predicted that the ruling party would lose the next election if it shelved political reform -- a remarkable statement , given the Liberal Democrats ' four decades in office . He added that he would not regret this . Business leaders traditionally pay for the ruling party . This time their exasperation with politics has boiled over . 
 By itself , Mr Miyazawa 's fall will not change the quality of Japan 's politics . The next government is likely to be an unstable coalition . Even if it does push through the electoral reform that Mr Miyazawa balked at , Japan 's politicians will not be transformed into policy gurus overnight . Yet Kiichi Miyazawa represents a powerful force for change . So does the shift in attitudes that lies behind Kiichi Miyazawa . As Japan 's internationalisation continues , those attitudes will shift further .",740,Japan,A29-8185,IN TERM,True,"the coalition of bureaucrats , businessmen and dissident politicians that got rid of Mr Miyazawa",6,True

The first is loyalty, and this is what kept Mr Mihara in the political mainstream in December, when the current rebellion within the Liberal Democratic Party began. Like many LDP members of the Diet (parliament), Mr Mihara inherited his seat from his father, who entrusted his heir to a rich faction boss; the son felt obedience was his duty. But the second political motive is ""logic"". This drove the reform-minded Mr Mihara to leave the LDP and set up his own party on June 21st.
Japanese politicians have been in a ferment of self-examination since June 18th, when 35 LDP members rebelled against the government's failure to support electoral reform and voted for an opposition no-confidence motion. An election has been called for July 18th, and LDP splinter groups are turning into new parties. But the mix of loyalty and logic will make it hard for Japan to replace LDP rule with unchaotic pluralism.
Though the logic of Mr Mihara's reformist views has pushed him to leave the ruling party, it has not led him to join the biggest group of rebels, led by Tsutomu Hata. Mr Mihara's New Party Harbinger (the name loses something in translation) has just ten members of the outgoing parliament. Two days after its launch, Mr Hata founded the New Born Party, with 44 members of the old parliament. The two new parties, says Mr Mihara, have identical policies. Personal loyalties keep them divided.
This sort of splintering heartens those who have stayed in the LDP. So far 46 of the party's members from the lower house have defected; 228 remain, not enough to form a majority should all be returned in the election. With the possibility that the LDP will lose its 38-year-old command of the lower house, its members are venting their rage publicly on the party's top brass; the foreign minister has suggested the party would be better off with Mr Miyazawa dead.
Yet the LDP is not finished. Although next month's election is unlikely to give it a majority in the Diet, it may remain the biggest party. A poll conducted by the Mainichi Shimbun; a big national newspaper, has suggested that 79% are happy to see defections from the LDP, but only 9% would vote for Mr Hata's party. The LDP had the support of 13% of respondents.
Many fear that the end of LDP dominance may mean the end of prosperous stability. A poll in another newspaper, the Asahi Shimbun, found that 61% were happy to see the government punished, and only 6% wanted the LDP to win the election outright. But just 24% favoured a government that excluded the LDP entirely. By far the most popular option, which attracted 62% support, was an LDP-based coalition.
With some form of coalition likely, everything hangs upon alliances. For the moment, no opposition party will admit to contemplating a post-election deal with the discredited Liberal Democrats. But the power of personality is making it hard for other alliances to form.
Mr Hata's party is getting the cold shoulder not only from Mr Mihara's Harbingers, but also from the Japan New Party, founded last year by Morihiro Hosokawa, another LDP defector. Like the Harbiners and Mr Hata's New Born Party, Mr Hosokawa supports electoral and campaign-finance reform, freer markets, a bigger role for Japan in the world and close alliance with America. But Mr Hata's group has a reputation for autocracy, mainly because of Ichiro Ozawa, the deputy leader, who reminds people of the LDP'S faction bosses.
Thus Mr Hata is getting more support from the Social Democratic Party, formerly the Japan Socialist Party, whose leaders have been saying that Mr Hata would make a fine prime minister. The policies of the Social Democrats clash thoroughly with Mr Hata's. They favour protection for farmers and support communist North Korea; they want Japan to disarm; their commitment to political reform is said to be shallow.
True, the party's leaders have been heaving their members rightwards. On June 22nd Sadao Yamahana, the Social Democrats' chairman, assured the American ambassador that his party favoured warm relations between the two countries. But the real reason for the party's fondness for Mr Hata has little to do with policy. As an LDP fixer in years gone by, Mr Ozawa excelled at buying votes from the former Socialists. Some may still owe him loyalty.
Before it was dissolved, the Social Democrats held 137 seats in the lower house. Mr Hata says he hopes to field 100 candidates in the general election next month. Even if all Mr Hata's people and all the Social Democrats win, an alliance between the two parties would be 19 short of an overall majority. It might make up the number by drawing in the small Democratic Socialist Party, or the Buddhist-linked Clean Government Party. Or it could form a minority government if the Communist Party promised not to vote against it. On the other hand, support might leak from this alliance. Hardline socialists within the Social Democrats, including some influential ones, might resign. Precarious as this sounds, Mr Hata has a greater chance of forming a government than anybody else. Though Mr Hosokawa's Japan New Party is doing well in the polls, it is unlikely to come up with more than 60 candidates. The most likely alternative to Mr Hata, therefore, is more LDP.
Whatever its unpopularity among urban sophisticates, the LDP has support in the countryside where votes count for up to three times those of townspeople. The party has devoted years to bribing the villages with railway lines and farm subsidies. LDP politicians have deep roots. They bring presents to weddings and funerals; they find jobs for slow sons and husbands for plain daughters. And they are well organised. The LDP will probably field 280 candidates.
Before this month's events, Mr Hata and his friends talked dreamily of brining about two-party politics on the American model. Perhaps Japan will get there in the end.

Which party did Mr Inoue represent? ""I don't know,"" comes the reply, ""but a friend asked me to back him."" This show of democratic zeal is more than many Japanese mustered in the election on July 18th.
The turnout, at 67%, was the lowest ever. The results looked less than exciting. The ruling Liberal Democratic Party, though shaken by scandal and splits, won all but four of the 227 seats in the Diet (parliament) left to it after rebels had created two new parties. After the election, five independents joint the LDP. It is still three times as big as the largest opposition party, the Social Democrats.
Yet changes there are. For the first time since 1955 the LDP finds itself without a majority in the lower house of the Diet. Four days after the election the party dumped its leader, Kiichi Miyazawa, because he had failed to reform the political system. A shouting match then broke out between old LDP chiefs and younger men demanding that the new leader be chosen by an open vote, not by a deal among election bosses.
The Social Democrats, for their part, lost 64 of their 134 seats. The leftist policies this party never quite brouht itself to drop -- support for disarmament, opposition to nuclear power and yet support for near-nuclear North Korea--now carry little political weight. Though the Communist Party still has 15 members of the lower house, Japan's left is all but finished.
The old parties of left and right have made room for the new centrists. The Japan New Party, formed last year, increased its representation from nil to 35, plus one after an independent joined; it is now set to merge with the 13-strong New Party Harbiner, most of whose members are LDP Secessionists. Then there is the even newer Japan Renewal Pary, set up last month by a former LDP finance minister, Tsutomu Hata. This party now holds 55 seats, 19 more than before the election. That is a fair achievement, given that the Renewal Party had barely a month to field candidates.
This marks the rise of a new kind of politician. LDP candidates have usually been elected with the help of support groups, which distribute money and favours to the voters. Lacking cash and friends, new candidates resorted to new methods. They appeared on television; they enthused student volunteers with their ideas; they put about the novel view that politics need not be monopolised by sleazy insiders.
Banri Kaieda, a Japan New Party candidate in central Tokyo, is typical. He decided to stand for the lower house less than a month before the vote. The election officer of his LDP rivals were covered with framed messages of support from local interest groups. But Mr Kaieda, who exudes a professional charm that befits a television commentator, came top of the poll.
At his election-night party, a bond trader in jeans and cowboy boots said Japan had taken a step towards America, where children dream of being president. From now on, young Japanese will also feel that politics is open to them. The feeling will deepen as television makes further gains at the expense of patronage. Japan's businesses are cutting their donations to the LDP; television is getting livelier. ""Japan needs a Larry King show,"" says the bond trader earnestly.
Calls for more vigorous debate are common amon new centrists. For the past 40 years, they say, Japan was united in pursuit of economic growth. Now it must weigh this against new priorities: defence, the environment, personal consumption. Finding the balance requires open argument, preferably conducted in an American-style two-party system. Ichiro Ozawa, Mr Hata's deputy, has shown his appetite for forthright talk in a new book which shocks many pacifist Japanese by advocating armed participation in United Nations peacekeeping work.
Where Japan will be a few years hence is clearer than where it will be tomorrow. The 228-seat LDP is 28 short of an overall majority. A coalition of Mr Hata's Renewers, the three socialist parties and the Buddhist-linked Clean Government Party could muster 195 seats. To govern, either side would need the help of the New Party. Its leader, Morihiro Hosokawa, veils his plans in mystery.
A year ago Mr Hosokawa said he wanted a two-party system. That was when it seemed impossible. Now he is in a position to bring Japan a lot nearer to two-partydom by joining an opposition alliance. But he gets on badly with Mr Hata's men; and he is thought to be holding out for the top job, even though his party would be only the fourth-biggest in the coalition. Speculation that he might join the LDP quietened on July 22nd, when he said he would not do that. His prevarication is unpopular. On a television show this week, an irate supporter said Mr Hosokawa should return his votes if he meant to do nothing with them.
The politicians promise to end their squabbles by Audust 2nd, when the Diet is to meet to elect a new prime minister. A different uncertainty may persist. On July 22nd the trial begins of Shin Kanemaru, the LDP faction boss whose downfall last year prompted the split in his party, and so eventually this month's election.
Mr Kanemaru's trial will expose some of the vast bribes that he used to buy the loyalty of party colleagues. Plenty of other LDP men, including some ex-LDP new centrists, are in danger of being tarnished. The pretrial investigation of Mr Kanemaru's affairs has already netted two provincial mayors. Their trials may in due course implicate other politicians.
Nobody knows whether the next government will last out the year, still less whether it will reform the electoral rules, blamed for fostering money politics. Reform, if it happens, could encourae the shift from porkbarrel to policy. But, judging from this election, that shift is happening anyway.","In the anonymous stream of a Tokyo expressway , an anonymous taxi driver declares , "" I voted for Inoue .

Morihiro Hosokawa is a conciliator, a waffler, a man apparently without ideals. Apart from his good looks and his relative youth (he is 55), he seems remarkably like the grey men who have dominated his country's politics for nearly four decades.
Yet Mr Hosokawa's route to power is unprecedented in Japan. Until the election on July 18th, his Japan New Party was a tiny opposition group in a country where opposition parties hardly mattered. Now Mr Hosokawa heads an eight-party coalition that will, barring unforeseen catastrophe, put an end to 38 unbroken years of rule by the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP).
Mr Hosokawa, an aristocrat and former provincial governor, fence--sat his way to the top job. The LDP lost its majority in parliament thanks to the defection in June of a group led by Tsutomu Hata, a former finance minister. In the subsequent election, Mr Hosokawa's New Party increased its lower-house strength from nothing to 35 seats. By keeping vague about which side he might join, Mr Hosokawa set his price high.
On July 22nd Mr Hosokawa spurned the LDP's advances. He then minced coyly towards a coalition of opposition parties. He said he would join them only if they accepted his version of political reform; the opposition assented. He said they should reconcile other policy differences; a suitable, if rather limited, joint manifesto was concocted. Finally, on July 29th, Mr Hosokawa accepted the coalition's offer to propose him as prime minister; ""it is my fate,"" he explained modestly. Since the coalition controls 245 seats to the LDP's 225, Mr Hosokawa is all but certain to get the job when the Diet appoints a new prime minister shortly.
The coalition is an odd one. The New Party, Mr Hata's Japan Renewal Party, and another LDP splinter called the New Party Harbinger, are centre-right; the Social Democrats still hold to some hard-left policies. But the Social Democrats lost so many seats in the election that they have little clout, whereas the reformists have momentum behind them. The alliance has agreed not to dwell on the Social Democrats' more extreme ideas, such as support for North Korea. Instead, it unites in calling for a fiscal stimulus, and for keeping Japan's rice market closed to imports. It also favours clearer apologies for Japan's behaviour in the second world war.
After the problem of keeping the alliance together, the new parties' main difficulty will be working with the bureaucrats, who have run Japan for four decades, with the LDP as their political front. Many LDP parliamentarians are ex-mandarins, including Kiichi Miyazawa, the outgoing prime minister. The boss of each ministry holds the rank of vice-minister, and usually wields more power than his political superior; but the LDP has never interfered in appointments to these positions. In exchange, the bureaucrats have bent the rules to help the politicians' business sponsors. Until the election two weeks ago, this ensured the flow of business contributions to the LDP, and so the continuation of the LDP-mandarin partnership.
The new parties represent a revolt against the power of civil servants. From his days in the provinces, Mr Hosokawa bitterly recalls how hard it was to extract the bureaucrats' permission to move a bus stop in his prefecture. Many of his followers also come from local politics; hardly any are former civil servants. Masayoshi Takemura, who leads the New Party Harbinger, is another ex-governor. Most of Mr Hata's people in the Japan Renewal Party come from the LDP, but not from the ex-bureaucrat part of it: their faction was led by populists from the countryside.
Some coalition members, especially Mr Hata's people, say that it is time for politicians to take control of policy. Such radicalism makes the bureaucrats anxious. ""The emphasis might shift to policies with good sound-bites,"" said a disdainful man from the Ministry of International Trade and Industry (MITI) to a Japanese newspaper. The reform of the electoral system and of campaign finance, the coalition's main priority, is unlikely to provoke a clash with the bureaucracy. Decentralisation, another coalition goal, would reduce the ministries' power; but the coalition may not hold together long enough to pursue this ambition. As a result, a fight between politicians and bureaucrats is more likely to centre on taxation.
The finance ministry shudders at the prospect of a cut. Last year the government ran a budget deficit of Y1.5 trillion, or 0.3% of GNP--tiny by most countries' standards, but enough to rattle Japan's prudent mandarins. Hard times are depressing tax revenues, so this year's shortfall is likely to be bigger. But hard times also spur those who want a tax cut, and the coalition partners smell a chance to defy the bureaucrats and make themselves popular.
The battle could complicate the budget process. The government already looks certain to miss the deadline, which falls at the end of July, by which time it is supposed to announce a ceiling for the growth of next year's budget. Ministries are meant to submit requests for spending by the end of August. Unseemly delay could result in squabbles among coalition partners, and thence to the political deadlock feared by those who wonder whether coalition government can really work in Japan.","There could be no better symbol of Japan 's paradoxical change than the country 's likely next prime minister .

Britain and China could tell America and Japan a thing or two about badly-managed trade disputes. They got into an argument a while ago about China's trade surplus with Britain. When negotiations failed, the British sent gunboats, forced the Chinese to buy British-made goods--and soured relations between the two countries for a century-and-a-half.
Bill Clinton seems unlikely to emulate the aggressive Lord Palmerston, foreign secretary and prime minister during the Opium Wars; nor is he likely to try to redress the balance of trade by forcing America's drugs surplus on the Japanese when he meets Japan's new prime minister, Morihiro Hosokawa, next week. But there is a danger in the administration's decision to focus its foreign policy on economic issues--which, in the case of Japan, means the trade deficit. Fixated by those figures, Washington is in danger of blinding itself to an aspect of the relationship far more important to America's future.
Japan's trade surplus with America shrank during the second half of the 1980s, then began to grow again in 1990. Its revival coincided with the collapse of the Soviet empire, then of the Soviet Union. By wiping out the threat from communism in Europe and diluting it in Asia, the Soviet collapse down-graded in the minds of some the importance of friendship with Japan. That gave strength to the school of thought politely described as ""revisionist"", more vulgarly known as Japan-bashing. It includes politicians such as David Bonior, the Democratic chief whip in the House of Representatives, who tabled an amendment threatening the withdrawal of American troops from Japan, if Japan did not cut its trade surplus.
Mr Clinton's own attitude seems ambivalent. On the one hand, his appointment of a Democratic grandee, Walter Mondale, to be ambassador to Japan signals the importance he places on relations with Tokyo; on the other hand, most discussions with Japan since he took office have focused on his ""results-oriented"" trade policy. The idea is to shrink the deficit by persuading the Japanese to allocate slices of their markets to American companies. Behind it is an implicit threat about what might happen if the ""results"" are not achieved.
LOOKING FOR TROUBLE
Endangering America's friendship with Japan in this way is mistaken for several reasons. Trade grievances cannot be measured by the size even of Japan's overall surplus, let alone its bilateral balance with a single country. A smaller Japanese surplus would not imply lower trade barriers, just as a larger one does not imply that the barriers are getting higher. And, however large its deficit, America should not be demanding slices of the Japanese market: such an approach has nothing to do with the free trade and competition to which Mr Clinton says he is committed. In any case, the chances are that the bone of contention may soon be buried. When Japan's economy (and thus its domestic demand) begins to recover from recession, probably early next year, its imports are likely to rise rapidly, reducing the trade imbalance.
Certainly, America has some legitimate reasons for complaint: Japan blatantly protects some of its markets. But Mr Hosokawa does see the need for deregulation. And there are other reasons, too, why America should be readier to treat Japan as a partner, not as an obstacle.
For more than four decades, from Japan's defeat in the second world war to the crumbling of the Soviet Union, America could reasonably take Japan for granted. Cowed by its grisly past, and fearful of communism, Japan stuck close under America's nuclear umbrella. But Japan is starting to come to terms with the past: talking about it more openly, thinking about asserting itself abroad through the United Nations, even discussing the possibility of changing its pacifist constitution.
Japanese attitudes towards America are shifting fast. In June 1985 only 21% of Japanese thought that relations between the two countries were broadly ""unfriendly""; in June 1990 36% did; in June 1993 64% did (compared with only 25% of Americans). Mr Clinton may also find Mr Hosokawa's attitude different from that of his predecessor, Kiichi Miyazawa. Mr Miyazawa broadly welcomed outside pressure (gaiatsu) as a useful way of overcoming resistance to change in Japan. Mr Hosokawa now has a Japanese mandate for change and may take less kindly to being pushed about by foreigners. Gaiatsu is out, naiatsu (internal pressure) is in vogue.
There is much at stake if America mishandles its partnership with Japan. North-east Asia, just across the Pacific from America, is probably the world's most dangerous region. There is that loose cannon, North Korea; the vast unpredictability of China's future; the sulkiness of still-powerful Russia. The closeness between America and Japan makes all this less dangerous than it might be. America's military presence also gives Japan a sense of security, which it might otherwise try to achieve by over-arming itself. Were a rift to row between the two, a Japan thinking more aggressively about its own security might then provoke its neighbours to do the same. Indeed, America might find bogeys lurking in the future much more frightening than a giant trade deficit.","BETTER TO PREPARE FOR TOMORROW 'S GENUINE FEARS THAN FOR TODAY 'S FALSE ONES 
 Britain and China could tell America and Japan a thing or two about badly - managed trade disputes . They got into an argument a while ago about China 's trade surplus with Britain . When negotiations failed , the British sent gunboats , forced the Chinese to buy British - made goods -- and soured relations between the two countries for a century - and - a - half . 
 Bill Clinton seems unlikely to emulate the aggressive Lord Palmerston , foreign secretary and prime minister during the Opium Wars ; nor is he likely to try to redress the balance of trade by forcing America 's drugs surplus on the Japanese when he meets Japan 's new prime minister , Morihiro Hosokawa , next week . But there is a danger in the administration 's decision to focus its foreign policy on economic issues -- which , in the case of Japan , means the trade deficit . Fixated by those figures , Washington is in danger of blinding itself to an aspect of the relationship far more important to America 's future . 
 Japan 's trade surplus with America shrank during the second half of the 1980s , then began to grow again in 1990 . Its revival coincided with the collapse of the Soviet empire , then of the Soviet Union . By wiping out the threat from communism in Europe and diluting it in Asia , the Soviet collapse down - graded in the minds of some the importance of friendship with Japan . That gave strength to the school of thought politely described as "" revisionist "" , more vulgarly known as Japan - bashing . It includes politicians such as David Bonior , the Democratic chief whip in the House of Representatives , who tabled an amendment threatening the withdrawal of American troops from Japan , if Japan did not cut its trade surplus . 
 Mr Clinton 's own attitude seems ambivalent . On the one hand , his appointment of a Democratic grandee , Walter Mondale , to be ambassador to Japan signals the importance he places on relations with Tokyo ; on the other hand , most discussions with Japan since he took office have focused on his "" results - oriented "" trade policy . The idea is to shrink the deficit by persuading the Japanese to allocate slices of their markets to American companies . Behind it is an implicit threat about what might happen if the "" results "" are not achieved . 
 LOOKING FOR TROUBLE 
 Endangering America 's friendship with Japan in this way is mistaken for several reasons . Trade grievances can not be measured by the size even of Japan 's overall surplus , let alone its bilateral balance with a single country . A smaller Japanese surplus would not imply lower trade barriers , just as a larger one does not imply that the barriers are getting higher . And , however large its deficit , America should not be demanding slices of the Japanese market : such an approach has nothing to do with the free trade and competition to which Mr Clinton says he is committed . In any case , the chances are that the bone of contention may soon be buried . When Japan 's economy ( and thus its domestic demand ) begins to recover from recession , probably early next year , its imports are likely to rise rapidly , reducing the trade imbalance .

His coalition government won Japan's election in July by promising political reform. Then, faced with a depressed economy, Mr Hosokawa promised tax cuts and deregulation. Next, to soften Russia's position on the disputed Kurile islands, Mr Hosokawa promised to encourage Japanese investment in Russia's Far East. Threatened with American sanctions, he promised on October 26th to reform Japan's closed construction-bidding system.
So far the promises are working. The Americans postponed the sanctions threat (see page 76). On October 21st the Russians too indulged Mr Hosokawa, cancelling a second planned clumping of nuclear waste in the Sea of Japan. At home, Mr Hosokawa is the most popular Japanese prime minister in the history of opinion polls; his bold talk is a relief after the long and waffly rule of the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP).
But soon the audience will want results. In theory, Mr Hosokawa should have no difficulty in carrying out political reform by December 15th, his self-imposed deadline. His coalition has agreed on a reform package: the present, corruption-prone system of multi-member constituencies is to be replaced by a mix of proportional representation and single-member constituencies; rules on campaign funding are to be tightened. Since the coalition holds an overall majority, getting these changes through the parliament might seem a mere formality.
But things are not so simple. Japan's leaders are expected to court consensus, so Mr Hosokawa wants to get the Liberal Democratic opposition's support. Negotiations are going slowly, and the December deadline is beginning to look over-optimistic.
Progress is scarcely better on deregulation, the second Hosokawa promise. On October 27th a committee of wise men concluded months of study on how to streamline government; its proposals are destined for the filing cabinets. The previous week another committee, set up by the prime minister himself, submitted the first draft of a deregulation plan. A retired civil servant dominates the drafting committee; his document is masterfully free of detail.
Slow progress on political reform and deregulation suggests that other Hosokawa plans--market-opening, a tax cut--may be hard to implement. In the end, unfulfilled promises and economic loom may undermine his popularity. Yet this does not mean that Japan's hopes of democratic rebirth have dimmed entirely: Mr Hosokawa's example is having an effect on others.
The prime minister's efforts have one broad aim: to check the power of the bureaucracy. Deregulation would do this directly; political reform would do it indirectly, by giving parliamentarians the legitimacy they need to face down civil servants. Mr Hosokawa does not talk about the third way of checking bureaucratic power, which is to strengthen the judiciary. Yet this is the field in which most is happening.
A VANGUARD OF LAWYERS
The most visible evidence of new judicial zest comes from the office of the Tokyo public prosecutor. Sensing that the end of LDP rule gave it free rein, the prosecutor has now arrested more than 20 local politicians and construction executives who allegedly traded public-works contracts for illegal election campaign money. This is an attack on bureaucrats too, since they run the bidding system and oversee the construction companies. On October 27th the construction minister announced that several senior officials under him would be punished.
A week earlier the education ministry also felt the brunt of new judicial assertiveness. The Tokyo High Court ruled that the ministry had abused its authority in ordering Saburo Ienaga, a historian, to rewrite part of his text book about the second world war. Mr Ienaga had written that Japanese troops raped Chinese women in Nanjing in 1937; the ministry deemed this unfit to print. In past trials the ministry got the upper hand; this time Mr Ienaga had the better of the verdict. Many Japanese reckon the LDP's fall explains this shift of fortune.
Other, less noted legal shifts are eroding the power of the bureaucracy. In the past, ordinary citizens have been unwilling to challenge government. Setsuo Miyazawa, who teaches law at Kobe University, cites a comparison with Germany. In 1989 just 1,119 suits were filed in Japan to contest the legality of government actions; in West Germany there were around 450,000.
The costs of a legal challenge have sometimes been set deliberately high to discourage citizens from taking on government. In Osaka, for instance, a group of citizens wanted a court injunction against the dispatch of Japanese troops on a United Nations peacekeeping mission on the rounds that this would violate Japan's pacifist constitution. An Osaka district court had set the cost of filing the case at a prohibitive Y95m ($800,000). In August the High Court cut it to Y1m.
Japan's justice ministry has traditionally headed off judicial checks on the bureaucracy by influencing the appointment and promotion of judges. In particular, the ministry saw to it that lawyers with experience as private attorneys were not appointed; instead, judges were chosen from among the more loyal lawyers working in the Supreme Court bureaucracy. That has recently been changing. This month alone, three judges have been recruited from the ranks of practising attorneys.
The bureaucrats retain the power to punish liberal judges with jobs on far-flung rural benches. If, as in America, the executive's nominations to the Supreme Court had to be confirmed by the legislature, the bureaucrats would be further weakened. One day such radicalism might just seem possible.","Japan's prime minister, Morihiro Hosokawa, is good at making promises.

Both have vowed to reform their politics and deregulate their economies.

The scale of corruption and thus the size of the task ahead was grander in Korea than in Japan. But Mr Kim's determination has startled even the most optimistic commentators. To prove his sincerity, he has opened his personal finances to public scrutiny. He has outlawed the false-name bank accounts used to hide ill-gotten cash. To make it harder for politicians to take bribes, he has promised to impose ceilings on election spending.

Deregulation requires as radicals change in economic management and bureaucratic minds in South Korea as in Japan, for Korean rulers have emulated the Japanese model of ""partnership"" between government and business. Korea's military strongman Park Chung Hee used Japan's 19th-century modernisation drive as a blueprint for his own economic programme. In the 1980s his successor, Chun Doo Hwan, consciously copied the Japanese ""income doubling plan"" of the 1960s. So South Korea now has massive diversified conglomerates with interlocking shareholdings, preferential financing for ""strategic"" industries and an economic bureaucracy that thinks it knows everything.
The Japanese have proudly likened their neighbors' emulation of their economic model to a flock of geese flying in a V-shape behind the leader. Now that Japan is sunk in recession, the Koreans are still learning but from Japan's mistakes. ""The Japanese economy has grown too complex to be directed by bureaucrats,"" says Young Soo-gil, of the Korean Economic Planning Board, ""which is perhaps why it has not been doing so well of late."" The solution, says an official in the president's office, is ""to let firms make decisions on purely economic grounds, rather than waiting for the government to tell them what to do.""
The government has already taken one big step in the direction of deregulation. As of November 1st, banks may charge whatever interest rates they like. Previously the government had held rates artificially low to provide low-cost capital for favoured firms.

The president started the ""framework"" talks between America and Japan seven months ago, when Kiichi Miyazawa, an old-guard Liberal Democrat, led Japan. A deadline of February 11th had been set for agreement on ways to open up Japanese markets. The odds for success ought to have been raised when the coalition led by Morihiro Hosokawa, Japan's reformist prime minister, came to power. Since Mr. Clinton and Mr. Hosokawa were obliged to admit, on February 12th, that their talks had come to naught, the future of the two countries' trade relations has been thrown perilously open.
Plenty of blame is being bandied about. The Americans accuse Japanese negotiators of over-literalness during the discussions: ""slippery"" is the word some are using. This attitude, say the Americans, ruled out serious discussion of a more general commitment to open markets in Japan. It led the Americans to insist on those infamous ""targets"" for a larger market share in various Japanese sectors, such as cars, car parts, public procurement and medical equipment. For their part, the Japanese-crying ""managed trade""--say they had no choice but to dig in their heels over targets that bureaucrats and politicians were either unable or unwilling to deliver.
American negotiators also complain that, until the final days of the talks, the political commitment in Japan to an agreement was simply not there. On the American side, the framework talks had been coordinated with smooth unanimity from within the White House, through the new National Economic Council (NEC). In Japan, it was the foreign ministry that took the lead. For most of the time, bureaucrats were in charge; ministers, according to one American negotiator, seemed to be reading from briefing notes.
Late in the night of February 10th, progress briefly seemed possible. After dining with Mr. Hosokawa at Blair House, Japan's foreign minister, Tsutomu Hata, called for a meeting between himself, America's trade representative, Mickey Kantor, Bowman Cutter from the NEC and Japan's chief trade negotiator. The prepared texts were put away. The Americans said they were ready to put in writing that various ""indicators"" of market share would not later be used as ""targets"". They admitted to certain a ""awkwardnesses"" in the American stand: that, for instance, it was hard to insist on a hefty market share for American cars since Detroit barely produced any right-hand-drive models. Had such awkwardnesses been brought out earlier, the talks might have been saved. As it was, the Americans had boxed both sides into a corner, and time had run out.
A majority of the administration's trade people privately feel some sympathy with the Japanese, and admit that the attempts negotiate market-share targets with Japan have run their course. The Japanese do not easily forget the 1986 semiconductor accord, when they agreed that the Americans should aim for a greater share of Japan's semiconductor market. The desired share, 20%, was quickly interpreted by the Americans as being a firm commitment. Now the Japanese are being attacked because that share has diminished. Yet the market is growing rapidly, benefiting American and Japanese chipmakers alike.
Yet if market-share targets are to be abandoned, the administration is not at all clear what should take their place. In the meantime, the pressure for face-saving retaliation against Japan is growing. On February 15th Mr. Kantor announced that America was drawing up a list of sanctions against Japanese products, worth several hundred million dollars, because Japan had reneged on agreements to grant Motorola, an American company, greater access to Japan's cellular-phone market.
This is a long-simmering dispute, and one unconnected with the framework talks. Mr. Kantor said it had nothing to do with targets or market share. But the administration's response has been hurried forward, and the issue is bound to be thrown into the argument.
So, too, is the desire by both Congress and the administration to reinstate the ""Super 301"" provision of America's trade laws. This grants America broad unilateral powers to find, and retaliate against, allegedly discriminatory trade practices by other countries. It is an unwelcome time for Super 301 to be revived. As it is, according to some estimates, America's anti-dumping actions, countervailing duties and the like disrupt as much international trade as Japan's anti-competitive practices. A vigorous use of Super 301 would not only do more to disrupt trade; it would also undermine the multilateral efforts to improve dispute-settlement procedures that have just been agreed under the Uruguay round of trade talks.
It is not yet certain that Mr. Clinton, who seems determined now to take personal charge of America's economic relations with Japan, will head down the jinoistic path. He may prefer to wait for Mr. Hosokawa to deliver on the promises he has made to the Japanese to free the economy of regulations that keep prices iniquitously high. America, certainly, has a legitimate interest in such issues. But instead of gauging its interest in terms of market share, argues Gary Saxonhouse of the University of Michigan, it should look instead at price structures in various Japanese sectors. Where in Japan are prices out of line with other countries, after taking distribution and transport costs into account? The administration has done woefully little work on the matter.
In the absence of any new trade policy towards Japan, America has turned back to an old and rather clumsy lever, the exchange rate. Since the collapse of the trade talks, the yen has soared, threatening to break through Y100 to the dollar (see page 85). The administration professes to remain aloof from these market exertions. It is, of course, delighted that a strong yen could squeeze Japanese exporters so hard that they will beg their bureaucrats to cede to American trade demands.
The administration also hopes that a strong yen will help to cut Japan's $60-billion trade surplus with America, particularly if Japan, despite its promises, fails to ease its fiscal constraint. A strong yen might well help to cut the surplus (though the surplus is neither bad in itself nor a measure of Japan's trade barriers), but that is not the point. What matters is whether the yen is near its ""equilibrium"" level vis-a-vis the dollar. If that equilibrium is nearer Y110-115--and economists at the Treasury Department were prepared to admit as much only a few months ago--then the yen has overshot. The administration's goading of the exchange rate will therefore have produced more long-term economic distortions than short-term political gains.","It was an outcome that Bill Clinton's administration could see coming from a long way off, but did little to prevent. The president started the ""framework"" talks between America and Japan seven months ago, when Kiichi Miyazawa, an old-guard Liberal Democrat, led Japan. A deadline of February 11th had been set for agreement on ways to open up Japanese markets. The odds for success ought to have been raised when the coalition led by Morihiro Hosokawa, Japan's reformist prime minister, came to power. Since Mr. Clinton and Mr. Hosokawa were obliged to admit, on February 12th, that their talks had come to naught, the future of the two countries' trade relations has been thrown perilously open.
Plenty of blame is being bandied about. The Americans accuse Japanese negotiators of over-literalness during the discussions: ""slippery"" is the word some are using. This attitude, say the Americans, ruled out serious discussion of a more general commitment to open markets in Japan. It led the Americans to insist on those infamous ""targets"" for a larger market share in various Japanese sectors, such as cars, car parts, public procurement and medical equipment. For their part, the Japanese-crying ""managed trade""--say they had no choice but to dig in their heels over targets that bureaucrats and politicians were either unable or unwilling to deliver.
American negotiators also complain that, until the final days of the talks, the political commitment in Japan to an agreement was simply not there. On the American side, the framework talks had been coordinated with smooth unanimity from within the White House, through the new National Economic Council (NEC). In Japan, it was the foreign ministry that took the lead. For most of the time, bureaucrats were in charge; ministers, according to one American negotiator, seemed to be reading from briefing notes.
Late in the night of February 10th, progress briefly seemed possible. After dining with Mr. Hosokawa at Blair House, Japan's foreign minister, Tsutomu Hata, called for a meeting between himself, America's trade representative, Mickey Kantor, Bowman Cutter from the NEC and Japan's chief trade negotiator. The prepared texts were put away. The Americans said they were ready to put in writing that various ""indicators"" of market share would not later be used as ""targets"". They admitted to certain a ""awkwardnesses"" in the American stand: that, for instance, it was hard to insist on a hefty market share for American cars since Detroit barely produced any right-hand-drive models. Had such awkwardnesses been brought out earlier, the talks might have been saved. As it was, the Americans had boxed both sides into a corner, and time had run out.
A majority of the administration's trade people privately feel some sympathy with the Japanese, and admit that the attempts negotiate market-share targets with Japan have run their course. The Japanese do not easily forget the 1986 semiconductor accord, when they agreed that the Americans should aim for a greater share of Japan's semiconductor market. The desired share, 20%, was quickly interpreted by the Americans as being a firm commitment. Now the Japanese are being attacked because that share has diminished. Yet the market is growing rapidly, benefiting American and Japanese chipmakers alike.
Yet if market-share targets are to be abandoned, the administration is not at all clear what should take their place. In the meantime, the pressure for face-saving retaliation against Japan is growing. On February 15th Mr. Kantor announced that America was drawing up a list of sanctions against Japanese products, worth several hundred million dollars, because Japan had reneged on agreements to grant Motorola, an American company, greater access to Japan's cellular-phone market.
This is a long-simmering dispute, and one unconnected with the framework talks. Mr. Kantor said it had nothing to do with targets or market share. But the administration's response has been hurried forward, and the issue is bound to be thrown into the argument.
So, too, is the desire by both Congress and the administration to reinstate the ""Super 301"" provision of America's trade laws. This grants America broad unilateral powers to find, and retaliate against, allegedly discriminatory trade practices by other countries. It is an unwelcome time for Super 301 to be revived. As it is, according to some estimates, America's anti-dumping actions, countervailing duties and the like disrupt as much international trade as Japan's anti-competitive practices. A vigorous use of Super 301 would not only do more to disrupt trade; it would also undermine the multilateral efforts to improve dispute-settlement procedures that have just been agreed under the Uruguay round of trade talks.
It is not yet certain that Mr. Clinton, who seems determined now to take personal charge of America's economic relations with Japan, will head down the jinoistic path. He may prefer to wait for Mr. Hosokawa to deliver on the promises he has made to the Japanese to free the economy of regulations that keep prices iniquitously high. America, certainly, has a legitimate interest in such issues. But instead of gauging its interest in terms of market share, argues Gary Saxonhouse of the University of Michigan, it should look instead at price structures in various Japanese sectors. Where in Japan are prices out of line with other countries, after taking distribution and transport costs into account? The administration has done woefully little work on the matter.
In the absence of any new trade policy towards Japan, America has turned back to an old and rather clumsy lever, the exchange rate. Since the collapse of the trade talks, the yen has soared, threatening to break through Y100 to the dollar (see page 85). The administration professes to remain aloof from these market exertions. It is, of course, delighted that a strong yen could squeeze Japanese exporters so hard that they will beg their bureaucrats to cede to American trade demands.
The administration also hopes that a strong yen will help to cut Japan's $60-billion trade surplus with America, particularly if Japan, despite its promises, fails to ease its fiscal constraint. A strong yen might well help to cut the surplus (though the surplus is neither bad in itself nor a measure of Japan's trade barriers), but that is not the point. What matters is whether the yen is near its ""equilibrium"" level vis-a-vis the dollar. If that equilibrium is nearer Y110-115--and economists at the Treasury Department were prepared to admit as much only a few months ago--then the yen has overshot. The administration's goading of the exchange rate will therefore have produced more long-term economic distortions than short-term political gains.",740,Japan,A29-8185,,False,,0,True

IT WAS a new twist in Japan's long saga of political scandals. On March 11th, after Kishiro Nakamura learnt that he was being accused of corruption, he turned himself in, and apparently timed his arrest so that it could be watched live on prime-time television. The Japanese may not care for the damage that scandal has done to their political system, but they can hardly complain about the entertainment it provides.
Mr Nakamura, who was construction minister in the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) government that lost office last July, was charged with receiving a bribe of Y10m ($100,000) from Kajima, a civil-engineering company. Kajima was part of a cartel known as the Saitama Saturday Association, which was allegedly involved in rigging bids for a dam-building project in Saitama, Mr Nakamura's home base.
This was the first occasion in almost three decades that a member of Japan's parliament had had his collar felt while the assembly was in session. The first, but maybe not the last. On March 15th Tokyo's public prosecutors said they wanted to question Takashi Inoue, a member of the upper house and head of the National Land Agency when Mr Nakamura was a minister. On March 16th the Asahi Shimbun alleged that Kiichi Miyazawa, the prime minister at the time, was involved too. Mr Miyazawa has denied it.
Construction cartels were common during the years of the building boom. Japanese public-works projects were not the only sufferers. On March 14th the American government claimed it was the victim of a cartel in connection with contracts at its naval base at Atsui. It is preparing to seek damages of Y1 billion from the companies involved.
Mr Nakamura seems an unlikely victim: he is young (44) and widely regarded as thoughtful. The classic image of the recipient of a construction back-hander is Kakuei Tanaka, a thuggish building contractor who clawed his way to the prime minister's office and ended up in prison. And, for a Japanese bribe, Y10m is peanuts.
All this can only benefit Morohiro Hosokawa, the embattled prime minister. It helps to remind people of the days when Japan was a one-party state run by mutual back-scratchers in the LDP. It also distracts attention from stories about Mr Hosokawa. In 1979, before he became governor of Kumamoto prefecture, a mansion owned by his family was renovated, allegedly at a cost of Y1 billion, by Kiyoshi Sagawa, the head of a trucking company. Three years later he received Y100m from Mr Sagawa to finance the election campaign that made him governor. Mr Hosokawa says that the money was paid back with interest; but he has yet to produce evidence.","TOKYO

The first non-Liberal Democratic government in 38 years has proved incapable of government. No replacement is likely to be cleaner or more cohesive. Thus runs the popular cynicism in Tokyo, after the announcement on April 8th by the prime minister, Morihiro Hosokawa, that he would resign over a financial scandal. Yet the truth is rather less depressing. Ever since electoral reform was enacted by parliament in March, Japan has been engaged in a second and no less worthwhile stage of its political reconstruction.
Mr Hosokawa's announcement on April 8th probably owed less to scandal than to policy. He has admitted receiving interest on a loan from Tokyo Sagawa Kyubin, a delivery company, and some unspecified irregularities in share dealing. None of this is recent; none involves big sums by the standards of Japan's politics; none is quite enough to explain his resignation. To see why, consider Mr Hosokawa's allies.
When Ichiro Ozawa, the power behind the coalition, was accused of corruption last year, he calmly declared that his past misbehaviour was proof of the need to reform politics. That misbehaviour involved raising cash for the Takeshita faction, the corrupt heart of the corrupt Liberal Democratic Party (LDP). Half of that faction later formed the Japan Renewal Party, which has supplied five of Mr Hosokawa's cabinet colleagues: it is a fair bet that all have more to be ashamed of than the departing prime minister. One of the five, Tsutomu Hata, seemed, at mid-week, likely to succeed Mr Hosokawa.
The real reason for Mr Hosokawa's resignation lies in the aftermath of his success in shoving electoral reform through parliament. The prime minister lost no time in announcing plans to reform Japan's clumsy tax system, which penalises salaried workers and favours the self-employed and the retired. To widen the tax net, Mr Hosokawa promised to shift the tax burden from incomes to consumption.
This angered the Social Democratic Party, the largest member of Mr Hosokawa's eight-party coalition, since consumption taxes are hard on the poorer Japanese who traditionally support it. The reform proposal also enraged Masayoshi Takemura, the leader of the New Harbinger Party, who stormed unannounced into Mr Hosokawa's office and screamed at him.
In the weeks that followed, Mr Hosokawa tried and failed to evict Mr Takemura from the cabinet. Mr Takemura and the Social Democrats withdrew support for Mr Hosokawa's modernising policies. Aside from tax reform, these include economic deregulation and a more assertive foreign policy.
Thus paralysed, Mr Hosokawa saw little virtue in staying on. So he resigned, hoping to build an alliance that could resume the business of reform later. And although the coalition seems likely to try to soldier on towards an election, the intrigue triggered by Mr Hosokawa's move has shown what a future pro-reform alliance might look like.
On the day he resigned, Mr Hosokawa launched a new parliamentary group called Reform. Rumours soon spread that the Hata-Ozawa Japan Renewal Party would join the Reform group, along with the Clean Government Party. The latter has no policies but lots of money to pay for election campaigning.
These three parties would give the Reform group around 150 members, about 100 short of the number required to form a majority in the lower house of parliament. To plug the gap, Mr Ozawa proposed to recruit Michio Watanabe, a Liberal Democratic baron; Mr Watanabe's vigorous foreign-policy views fit well with the Reformers. For two days Mr Watanabe tried to persuade enough party colleagues to join him. He failed. As a result, the Reform gang seems to have resigned itself to sticking with the old coalition for the moment.
While the shape of a future modernising party could thus be glimpsed, so too could that of a traditionalist opposition. The New Harbingers and Social Democrats were canvassing support from other Liberal Democratic groups that share the view that Japan should stick by its pacifist constitution. Kiichi Miyazawa, a former prime minister, is a prominent LDP traditionalist. The Social Democrats and Liberal Democrats both have rural supporters who dislike deregulation of agriculture. In this they stand opposed to the urban-based Reformers.
Both wins of the LDP seem, for the moment, to have decided not to defect. The party remains easily Japan's biggest. By sticking together it may regain power at the next election. Yet the LDP's unity is soon to face a test. The redrawing of constituency boundaries, which should be completed this autumn, will oblige the party's bosses to sever some parliamentarians from their old districts. The new boundaries' victims will make ready recruits for other parties.","The country's cleanest politician is dirty after all.

A few paces from the porno shops and pin-ball parlours stands a brightly lit koban, a police box. Inside, three policemen sit behind a long, low table spread with detailed maps, old-fashioned telephones, and a box of red-tipped seals for stamping documents. Little local police stations like this one, sometimes manned by only one person, are to be found in 15,000 places across Japan. They represent one of the secrets behind Japan's enviably low crime rate.
Every few minutes somebody comes in to ask for help. A man dressed exclusively in leather is looking for a certain night club; this is pointed out for him on one of the maps. Another caller wants to report a lost bag; this involves official stamps. Then a grizzled man with a crew-cut enters, bows deeply to the policemen, and hands over Y200 ($1.95). He is repaying a loan: if you are caught short without money for a bus journey home in Tokyo, the police can be relied upon to help, out.
This remarkable cosiness between police and civilians comes with a correspondingly low crime rate. In 1990 Japan suffered 12 thefts per 1,000 people, compared with America's 53 and Germany's 44. The contrast between Japan's present and its past is even more remarkable, although the headline figures obscure the nature of the change. Between 1970 and 1990 the total number of recorded crimes jumped 15%, reflecting the growth in petty theft that naturally accompanied the spread of property. But the striking figure is that, over the same period, violent crime dropped by two-thirds.
What can other countries learn from this? Deriving lessons from Japan involves distinguishing between two kinds of reason for the country's social peace. The first is the particular nature of its society: homogeneous, disciplined, imbued with a fear of ostracism that encourages conformity. The second kind of reason, which may hold transportable lessons, lies in the special strength of its police.
It is tempting to ascribe Japan's low crime rate entirely to social causes. Japan has almost no under-class. Illiteracy is practically unheard of. Tramps remain a rare sight. Immigrants, whose children in some rich countries form a crime-prone underclass, are rare too.
Four decades of remarkable economic growth have rewarded disciplined work both handsomely and evenly. GNP per head has doubled since 1970. Income inequalities have remained remarkably low: at the age of 50, high-school graduates working in big firms get paid 85% as much as their university-educated contemporaries. Even in its worst post-war recession, the government's (admittedly optimistic) statistics say that unemployment remains below 3%. In short, the fat rewards of accepting society's rules have made it foolish to rebel.
Drug-taking is minimal: in 1991 a mere 60 people were arrested for offences relating to cocaine, and 110 for ones relating to heroin. Japanese people, explains Akira Kawada of the National Police Academy, disapprove of drugs. Last year a publishing magnate was arrested for importing cocaine; to show their distaste, some Japanese vowed to stop buying his books.
Yet the social causes of Japan's respect for the law, though powerful, can only suggest why Japan is more peaceful than other rich countries. They cannot explain why Japan is more peaceful today than in the past. Indeed, Japan's serious crime has dwindled even though some of the social conditions that tend to restrain crime have eroded.
HARDER TIMES
Immigrants, for example, maybe scarce, but they are more numerous than they were. Cocaine and heroin were even rarer ten years ago than today. Conservative, multi-generation households are giving way to nuclear families and people living alone. Close-knit, village-like communities are being replaced by modern anonymity.
Nobody is more aware of this last point than the Japanese police. In 1992 the National Police Agency complained of ""the borderless rampancy of crimes"", meaning that society, and therefore crime, has grown more mobile.
In 1970 one Japanese in five had a car; in 1990 one in two. Driving, rather than walking, cuts people off from their neighbours: they lose opportunities to greet each other in the street. Cars also encourage shoppers to o less to friendly local stores, and more to distant discounters where customers avoid each other's eyes. And cars enable families to abandon cramped town centres, where everybody knows the neighbours, in favour of spacious suburbs, where anonymity reigns.
All this weakens the old social ties that both deterred crime and made investigating it easier. In the motorised age, a criminal can escape faster from the scene of his crime. He may drive to the scene too, so the old assumption that he is somebody who lives nearby is no loner safe. Even if he does turn out to be a local, his neighbours may never have spoken to him. Personal relations are ""thinning"", in the police agency's phrase.
In May 1990 a small girl was found dead in Ashikaga, a quiet town in Tochigi prefecture, on the border between the Japan Alps and Tokyo's Kanto plain. Over the next 18 months, the police distributed an average of ten leaflets to each of Ashikaga's 53,000 homes, asking for useful information. But Ashikaga had suffered the transition to mobility: since the early 1970s cars had reduced the number of pedestrians in its shopping streets on the average July Sunday by two-thirds. Leaflets and door-to-door questioning produced few results. When a suspect was eventually arrested (he confessed to murdering two other children previously), it transpired that none of his neighbours had known his name, his job, or anything else about him.
NEIGHBOURLY POLICEMAN
Japan's policing triumph--the reduction of serious crime despite more awkward social circumstances--has been achieved through skilful adaptation. The most important instance of this is to be found in the maps and friendly grins in that Tokyo police box. The stream of callers asking for help testifies to a triumphant campaign to ensure that a traditional system has not been left behind by social modernisation, but has been adapted and extended as the central feature of policing in Japan.
The importance of neighbourhood policing was recognised decades ago. In 1967 the patrol police, who, as a subsection of the traffic police, had been considered the dregs of the force, were dignified with the status of a division.
These days, some 6,000 police boxes are manned day and night in Japan's towns; in the countryside, the boxes, which double as policemen's homes, number 9,000. By deploying manpower widely rather than concentrating it in big police stations, Japan's police aim to be more accessible than their western counterparts. They spend much time dispensing friendly services like telling people the way, taking charge of lost property, or sheltering stray pets. A wife in a live-in police box is expected to help, handling reports of lost goods if her husband is out when someone calls.
To maintain good community relations, the police take par in local events with deadly earnestness. Two years ago in Kanazawa, a small provincial town, the police used to commandeer the top floor of a civic centre for band practices, drowning out this correspondent's Japanese lessons. The National Police Agency claims that police bands give about 5,000 performances each year, and that these are heard (whether with pleasure the statistics do not relate) by some 20m people.
This cosiness traditionally encouraged the public to co-operate with the police, and to volunteer information about suspicious characters. To reinforce this, police-box officers try to call on each family, shop and company in their area twice a year.
But, as the Ashikaga murder showed, social change has undermined the efficacy of traditional police methods. The need to adapt has been clear since the late 1970s, when Masayuki Murayama, a legal academic at Chiba University, accompanied patrolmen on their rounds in Tokyo. He found that women were increasingly going out to work, so it was becoming harder to find householders to survey. Such residents as could be found were becoming less welcoming; only janitors and landlords seemed eager to help. Mr Murayama even found that policemen sometimes forged visit reports in order to escape this unrewarding duty.
Mr Murayama's patrolmen were scarcely more enthusiastic about handling routine callers at the police box. However essential this work might have been to preserving the police force's reputation, patrolmen considered it mundane. In the past, callers had occasionally volunteered information that led to arrests; by the 1970s this was rare, so handling calls gave policemen few opportunities to win points that might lead to promotion.
Instead, more and more arrests resulted from spot checks on suspicious-looking characters in the street--a few questions, an inspection of belongings. Mr Murayama found that patrolmen reserved their enthusiasm for this, since arrests won promotion points. This research was later backed up by official surveys, which found that police boxes were often left unmanned while their occupants were on patrol, much to the public's frustration.
Rather than resin itself the decline of the police box, however, Japan's police force has fought back. In the mid-1980s, the police bean to change the system of evaluating officers, to encourage helpfulness to the public rather than just notching up arrest scores. The visiting system has been adapted to make it more effective: visits concentrate on the people who need them most (the old, for instance) and the areas where they can be most useful (places where mobility is high and it is harder to keep tabs on people). To improve the quality of simple services, the police force has also started rehiring retired policemen, who concentrate exclusively on less taxing jobs like dealing with lost pedestrians and objects found in the street.
The retired policemen are also meant to reduce the number of occasions when police boxes are deserted. But this problem also has a high-tech solution. The police have installed about 100 ""automatic"" boxes: when a caller enters an empty box, a policeman from a nearby station appears on a video screen to answer questions. If the caller wants a local map, this is immediately faxed to him.
The range of help dispensed from the police box has been broadened so as to keep the public interested. In 1991 the police recorded 188,000 requests for personal advice, a modest expansion on 1990. Just under a third related to crime prevention; advice on family problems accounted for more than a quarter of the questions, and civil affairs (such as personal finance) accounted for nearly a fifth.
Social mobility has increased the number of old people living alone and uncared for by their children, and so vulnerable to crime. Community policemen have seen in this an opportunity: at the end of 1991 they claimed to be paying regular visits to some 140,000 people over 65 living alone, about one in seven such households. As well as dispensing advice on crime prevention, the police make it their business to report on the state of the elderly to their relations, so bolstering their reputation for helpfulness.
All this seems to be working. The public's continued willingness to co-operate with the police is revealed in the lost-and-found statistics. In 1991 the number of articles handed in to the police (4.1m) astonishingly exceeded the number of reported losses (2.9m). Fully Y18.5 billion ($137m) in lost cash was found and handed over to the police by dutiful citizens.
Could other countries emulate this system? Some have tried: in 1991 alone, 13 countries sent missions to Japan to study community policing. Frustratingly for foreigners, the friendly style of Japan's patrolmen does in part depend on the friendliness of the people they work with. In 1991 only three policemen died while carrying out their duties; of these, two were killed by an erupting volcano. Not being brutalised, Japanese policemen tend not to be brutal.
Yet this does not mean that Japan's policing friendliness is impossible to copy. For one thin, society can be encouraged to be gentle: gun control is one obvious measure hose absence in America is reckoned crazy in Japan. And the relaxed style of Japan's police owes much to two replicable policies: generous staffing, and leniency.
Japan's policemen claim that they are understaffed, noting that, in 1990, the country had one policeman per 556 Japanese, proportionately fewer than in America (one per 379) or France (268). But Setsuo Miyazawa, a legal academic at Kobe University, points out that Japan's police force is big relative to the number of crimes it must cope with. In 1990 Japan's thefts per policeman were just two-thirds of France's and less than a tenth of America's. Japan's policemen have less work, so their relaxed style should not come as a surprise.
The small number of crimes per policeman is the result of a 73% expansion in police staff between 1960 and 1990. Expansion made promotion easier to come by, which further helped morale; this was reinforced by several redefinitions of ranks. The latest came in 1991, when middle ranks (inspector and assistant inspector) expanded from 19% to 36% of the force, while the numbers of lowly patrolmen shrunk.
Good morale is reflected in the competition to join the police force. In 1991, even before the current recession made private-sector jobs hard to et, 8.6 candidates applied for each available job. More than a third of the 7,500 successful applicants had been to college or university.
Then there is the leniency. In 1990, 31% of offenders caught and questioned by the police were dismissed after signing an apology for some minor offence. The prevailing attitude of forgiveness achieves three objects. Police are spared the job of collecting evidence to support the prosecution of minor cases. The public is reinforced in its view that policemen are decent. And the stigma of judicial action is reserved for serious crimes.
THE UNNEIGHBOURLY POLICEMAN
None of this means that Japan's policemen are soft. Far from it: a big reason for the low rate of serious crime is that it is so hard to get away with. In 1989 Japan cleared 96% of its murder cases--for which the penalty may be death--and 76% of its robberies, a far higher proportion than elsewhere. The reasons for this are replicable too, though some may not be desirable.
The scattered deployment entailed by the police-box system enables patrolmen to et to the scene of a crime quickly. Those at the bar-district box could walk to the boundary of their allotted area in two minutes. In 1989 it took the police an average of five minutes and 49 seconds to reach the scene after receiving an emergency telephone call.
Japan's police force is experimenting with new methods. It is developing a central computer database of photographs and notes on suspects that can be easily consulted by prefectural police agencies. New roadside machines check number-plates of passing cars against those of wanted vehicles. More gadgets check fragments of fingerprints left by suspects against vast numbers of fingerprints held in a computer. Technological advance helps to derive clues from infinitesimal quantities of material left behind by criminals.
Next come the less desirable causes for Japan's high clearance rate, which come down to the fact that suspects have few civil rights. In theory, Japanese have the right to silence and legal help when they are arrested. In practice, suspects can be held for 23 days without being charged, and often without access to a lawyer.
Japan's police therefore have plenty of opportunities to force confessions. These are neither recorded verbatim nor tape-recorded. Instead, detectives write up the results of their interrogations into coherent statements, and tell the suspects to sin them.
In 1990 fully 91.5% of defendants tried at district and summary courts had signed such confessions, according to Mr Murayama. Japan's constitution declares that forced confessions, or confessions made after unduly long periods of detention, shall not be admitted in court; and that confession alone is insufficient basis for conviction. In practice, confessions carry a lot of weight, in part because those who are accused of crimes are given little chance to collect evidence for their defence.
In 1990 36% of defendants tried at district and summary courts had no witnesses at all to give evidence on their behalf. Among the rest, the average number of witnesses was just 1.5. Press reports of arrests and trials often assume that the accused is guilty. It is only slightly amazing, therefore, that in 1990 the conviction rate in district and summary courts was 99.8%.
Leniency and friendliness are thus matched with illiberal ferocity towards those presumed guilty; inducements to respect the law and the police are backed by harsh treatment for those who fail to do so. Other rich countries, with loner traditions of civil liberties, may balk at the second half of Japan's formula. But the first--the friendly policeman in a little local box--plus the blending of police work with some of the roles usually played by social workers--provides a valuable lesson for outsiders.","It is Friday night in a bar district of Tokyo, and the Japanese miracle is under way. A few paces from the porno shops and pin-ball parlours stands a brightly lit koban, a police box. Inside, three policemen sit behind a long, low table spread with detailed maps, old-fashioned telephones, and a box of red-tipped seals for stamping documents. Little local police stations like this one, sometimes manned by only one person, are to be found in 15,000 places across Japan. They represent one of the secrets behind Japan's enviably low crime rate.
Every few minutes somebody comes in to ask for help. A man dressed exclusively in leather is looking for a certain night club; this is pointed out for him on one of the maps. Another caller wants to report a lost bag; this involves official stamps. Then a grizzled man with a crew-cut enters, bows deeply to the policemen, and hands over Y200 ($1.95). He is repaying a loan: if you are caught short without money for a bus journey home in Tokyo, the police can be relied upon to help, out.
This remarkable cosiness between police and civilians comes with a correspondingly low crime rate. In 1990 Japan suffered 12 thefts per 1,000 people, compared with America's 53 and Germany's 44. The contrast between Japan's present and its past is even more remarkable, although the headline figures obscure the nature of the change. Between 1970 and 1990 the total number of recorded crimes jumped 15%, reflecting the growth in petty theft that naturally accompanied the spread of property. But the striking figure is that, over the same period, violent crime dropped by two-thirds.
What can other countries learn from this? Deriving lessons from Japan involves distinguishing between two kinds of reason for the country's social peace. The first is the particular nature of its society: homogeneous, disciplined, imbued with a fear of ostracism that encourages conformity. The second kind of reason, which may hold transportable lessons, lies in the special strength of its police.
It is tempting to ascribe Japan's low crime rate entirely to social causes. Japan has almost no under-class. Illiteracy is practically unheard of. Tramps remain a rare sight. Immigrants, whose children in some rich countries form a crime-prone underclass, are rare too.
Four decades of remarkable economic growth have rewarded disciplined work both handsomely and evenly. GNP per head has doubled since 1970. Income inequalities have remained remarkably low: at the age of 50, high-school graduates working in big firms get paid 85% as much as their university-educated contemporaries. Even in its worst post-war recession, the government's (admittedly optimistic) statistics say that unemployment remains below 3%. In short, the fat rewards of accepting society's rules have made it foolish to rebel.
Drug-taking is minimal: in 1991 a mere 60 people were arrested for offences relating to cocaine, and 110 for ones relating to heroin. Japanese people, explains Akira Kawada of the National Police Academy, disapprove of drugs. Last year a publishing magnate was arrested for importing cocaine; to show their distaste, some Japanese vowed to stop buying his books.
Yet the social causes of Japan's respect for the law, though powerful, can only suggest why Japan is more peaceful than other rich countries. They cannot explain why Japan is more peaceful today than in the past. Indeed, Japan's serious crime has dwindled even though some of the social conditions that tend to restrain crime have eroded.
HARDER TIMES
Immigrants, for example, maybe scarce, but they are more numerous than they were. Cocaine and heroin were even rarer ten years ago than today. Conservative, multi-generation households are giving way to nuclear families and people living alone. Close-knit, village-like communities are being replaced by modern anonymity.
Nobody is more aware of this last point than the Japanese police. In 1992 the National Police Agency complained of ""the borderless rampancy of crimes"", meaning that society, and therefore crime, has grown more mobile.
In 1970 one Japanese in five had a car; in 1990 one in two. Driving, rather than walking, cuts people off from their neighbours: they lose opportunities to greet each other in the street. Cars also encourage shoppers to o less to friendly local stores, and more to distant discounters where customers avoid each other's eyes. And cars enable families to abandon cramped town centres, where everybody knows the neighbours, in favour of spacious suburbs, where anonymity reigns.
All this weakens the old social ties that both deterred crime and made investigating it easier. In the motorised age, a criminal can escape faster from the scene of his crime. He may drive to the scene too, so the old assumption that he is somebody who lives nearby is no loner safe. Even if he does turn out to be a local, his neighbours may never have spoken to him. Personal relations are ""thinning"", in the police agency's phrase.
In May 1990 a small girl was found dead in Ashikaga, a quiet town in Tochigi prefecture, on the border between the Japan Alps and Tokyo's Kanto plain. Over the next 18 months, the police distributed an average of ten leaflets to each of Ashikaga's 53,000 homes, asking for useful information. But Ashikaga had suffered the transition to mobility: since the early 1970s cars had reduced the number of pedestrians in its shopping streets on the average July Sunday by two-thirds. Leaflets and door-to-door questioning produced few results. When a suspect was eventually arrested (he confessed to murdering two other children previously), it transpired that none of his neighbours had known his name, his job, or anything else about him.
NEIGHBOURLY POLICEMAN
Japan's policing triumph--the reduction of serious crime despite more awkward social circumstances--has been achieved through skilful adaptation. The most important instance of this is to be found in the maps and friendly grins in that Tokyo police box. The stream of callers asking for help testifies to a triumphant campaign to ensure that a traditional system has not been left behind by social modernisation, but has been adapted and extended as the central feature of policing in Japan.
The importance of neighbourhood policing was recognised decades ago. In 1967 the patrol police, who, as a subsection of the traffic police, had been considered the dregs of the force, were dignified with the status of a division.
These days, some 6,000 police boxes are manned day and night in Japan's towns; in the countryside, the boxes, which double as policemen's homes, number 9,000. By deploying manpower widely rather than concentrating it in big police stations, Japan's police aim to be more accessible than their western counterparts. They spend much time dispensing friendly services like telling people the way, taking charge of lost property, or sheltering stray pets. A wife in a live-in police box is expected to help, handling reports of lost goods if her husband is out when someone calls.
To maintain good community relations, the police take par in local events with deadly earnestness. Two years ago in Kanazawa, a small provincial town, the police used to commandeer the top floor of a civic centre for band practices, drowning out this correspondent's Japanese lessons. The National Police Agency claims that police bands give about 5,000 performances each year, and that these are heard (whether with pleasure the statistics do not relate) by some 20m people.
This cosiness traditionally encouraged the public to co-operate with the police, and to volunteer information about suspicious characters. To reinforce this, police-box officers try to call on each family, shop and company in their area twice a year.
But, as the Ashikaga murder showed, social change has undermined the efficacy of traditional police methods. The need to adapt has been clear since the late 1970s, when Masayuki Murayama, a legal academic at Chiba University, accompanied patrolmen on their rounds in Tokyo. He found that women were increasingly going out to work, so it was becoming harder to find householders to survey. Such residents as could be found were becoming less welcoming; only janitors and landlords seemed eager to help. Mr Murayama even found that policemen sometimes forged visit reports in order to escape this unrewarding duty.
Mr Murayama's patrolmen were scarcely more enthusiastic about handling routine callers at the police box. However essential this work might have been to preserving the police force's reputation, patrolmen considered it mundane. In the past, callers had occasionally volunteered information that led to arrests; by the 1970s this was rare, so handling calls gave policemen few opportunities to win points that might lead to promotion.
Instead, more and more arrests resulted from spot checks on suspicious-looking characters in the street--a few questions, an inspection of belongings. Mr Murayama found that patrolmen reserved their enthusiasm for this, since arrests won promotion points. This research was later backed up by official surveys, which found that police boxes were often left unmanned while their occupants were on patrol, much to the public's frustration.
Rather than resin itself the decline of the police box, however, Japan's police force has fought back. In the mid-1980s, the police bean to change the system of evaluating officers, to encourage helpfulness to the public rather than just notching up arrest scores. The visiting system has been adapted to make it more effective: visits concentrate on the people who need them most (the old, for instance) and the areas where they can be most useful (places where mobility is high and it is harder to keep tabs on people). To improve the quality of simple services, the police force has also started rehiring retired policemen, who concentrate exclusively on less taxing jobs like dealing with lost pedestrians and objects found in the street.
The retired policemen are also meant to reduce the number of occasions when police boxes are deserted. But this problem also has a high-tech solution. The police have installed about 100 ""automatic"" boxes: when a caller enters an empty box, a policeman from a nearby station appears on a video screen to answer questions. If the caller wants a local map, this is immediately faxed to him.
The range of help dispensed from the police box has been broadened so as to keep the public interested. In 1991 the police recorded 188,000 requests for personal advice, a modest expansion on 1990. Just under a third related to crime prevention; advice on family problems accounted for more than a quarter of the questions, and civil affairs (such as personal finance) accounted for nearly a fifth.
Social mobility has increased the number of old people living alone and uncared for by their children, and so vulnerable to crime. Community policemen have seen in this an opportunity: at the end of 1991 they claimed to be paying regular visits to some 140,000 people over 65 living alone, about one in seven such households. As well as dispensing advice on crime prevention, the police make it their business to report on the state of the elderly to their relations, so bolstering their reputation for helpfulness.
All this seems to be working. The public's continued willingness to co-operate with the police is revealed in the lost-and-found statistics. In 1991 the number of articles handed in to the police (4.1m) astonishingly exceeded the number of reported losses (2.9m). Fully Y18.5 billion ($137m) in lost cash was found and handed over to the police by dutiful citizens.
Could other countries emulate this system? Some have tried: in 1991 alone, 13 countries sent missions to Japan to study community policing. Frustratingly for foreigners, the friendly style of Japan's patrolmen does in part depend on the friendliness of the people they work with. In 1991 only three policemen died while carrying out their duties; of these, two were killed by an erupting volcano. Not being brutalised, Japanese policemen tend not to be brutal.
Yet this does not mean that Japan's policing friendliness is impossible to copy. For one thin, society can be encouraged to be gentle: gun control is one obvious measure hose absence in America is reckoned crazy in Japan. And the relaxed style of Japan's police owes much to two replicable policies: generous staffing, and leniency.
Japan's policemen claim that they are understaffed, noting that, in 1990, the country had one policeman per 556 Japanese, proportionately fewer than in America (one per 379) or France (268). But Setsuo Miyazawa, a legal academic at Kobe University, points out that Japan's police force is big relative to the number of crimes it must cope with. In 1990 Japan's thefts per policeman were just two-thirds of France's and less than a tenth of America's. Japan's policemen have less work, so their relaxed style should not come as a surprise.

The coalition partners, if that is the word, are Mr Bolger's National Party, with 44 seats, and the New Zealand First Party, with 17 seats. Both are right of centre, but have little liking for each other. New Zealand First's leader, Winston Peters, was sacked from National's parliamentary group in 1992 and formed his own party. In the general-election campaign, he said he would never ""sidle up"" to Mr Bolger. He drove a hard bargain with the National Party and collected the jobs of deputy prime minister and treasurer, giving him a big voice in financial policy. He longs to become prime minister.

The coalition's big promise, the replacement of the generous tax-financed pension scheme with a compulsory contributory plan, is getting into trouble. It is to be put to a referendum in September, and opinion polls suggest it may be rejected. Mr Peters is its architect and main cheerleader. If the new proposal fails, his political star will fall further. His Maori MPS might even set up their own party. 
For the National Party, the pleasure of the slide of an unloved partner is tempered by the fact that it does not have the numbers to govern on its own.

Well, that's politics, even in the land of sheep. Mr Bolger, who has himself done some political plotting in his time, took it well. When he returned to Wellington on October 3ist, he bowed out graciously as leader of the National Party. After all, his opponent is a lady, even though some of her rougher critics have called Jenny Shipley an armoured personnel carrier. Mrs Shipley will, if a number of political problems can be fixed, become New Zealand's first woman prime minister by the end of the month. 
Mr Bolger was, it seems, taken unawares. During his visit to Britain and then France he appeared to have no idea that knives were being sharpened at home. After the Commonwealth meeting, he planned to attend a summit of the Asia-Pacific Economic Co-operation forum in Vancouver later this month, speaking up for free trade and wagging a finger at stricken South-East Asian states tempted towards more protectionism. In his diary were proposed trips to China, and to the United States. However, foreign affairs do not necessarily impress the voters at home. 
New Zealand has a coalition government composed of Mr Bolger's National Party and the small New Zealand First party. It is sensationally unpopular. The National Party's support had fallen to 30% and its partner's to 2%. A government plan to introduce a compulsory private pension scheme was rejected in a referendum by 92% of the voters in September. New Zealanders know what they don't like. 
Mrs Shipley, the transport minister in Mr Bolger's cabinet, is regarded as a pillar of the right. She has risen quickly through National Party ranks in a ten-year political career. Party members who have backed her against the experienced and pragmatic Mr Bolger believe she will be more of a match for the Labour leader, Helen Clark, in the next general election, due by 1999. 
Labour's popularity had risen recently from 28% to above 50%. If a snap election were held, Labour might perhaps be able to form a government on its own. Much of Labour's support, however, stems from disenchantment with the first government to be elected under the now unpopular proportional-representation system. Mrs Shipley's supporters say she can impose discipline on bumbling, ineffective ministersparticularly those from New Zealand First-and introduce new faces to the cabinet. The finance minister, Bill Birch, the foreign minister, Don McKinnon, and the defence minister, Paul East, have been lined up by the plotters for the firing squadthough Mrs Shipley respects Mr Birch's political acumen. The National Party gained seven points this week after Mrs Shipley became party leader. 
Despite her own leanings to the right, Mrs Shipley may shift the National Party towards the centre. She may also exploit her appeal as a woman who has made it to the top. The party needs to win more women voters, maybe by bringing more women into the cabinet. Mrs Shipley is at present the only one. Her success has won favour among businessmen, worried by the tendency to drift they believe has been imposed on National through its link with New Zealand First. Despite a huge increase in spending on health, education and welfare, which has put at risk the surpluses and tax cuts planned by the National Party, the government still faces criticism over cuts in hospital services. 
The National Party's and Mrs Shipley's immediate problem, though, is getting New Zealand First to approve the new prime minister. Winston Peters, the leader of New Zealand First, is piqued that he has not been involved in the great events of the past week, even though he is deputy prime minister. So far he has refused to endorse the change. But with almost no support at large for his own party, he may have no alternative but to go along with Mrs Shipley.

The central business district remains at a virtual standstill. Firms lucky enough to be equipped with generators, or to have them flown in from Australia, have stayed open. But many small businesses are fighting for survival. 
For Jenny Shipley, who took over as prime minister in November, the power crisis is her first big leadership test, not least because she plans more electricity privatisations. The blackouts have left people asking plenty of questions about Mercury Energy, the firm that is supposed to supply Auckland's power. 
The inquiry that has been set up will want to know why Mercury relied on just four underground cables to power the booming centre of a city of im people. Auckland, moreover, is rapidly filling up with big new hotels and blocks of flats as it awaits such events as the summit of the Asia-Pacific Economic Co-operation forum next year and the Americas Cup yachting competition. Wellington, the capital, and Christchurch are smaller cities, but both rely on twice as many main cables for their power. 
""It is the most incredible, freakish bad luck you could ever imagine,"" says Jim Macaulay, Mercury's chairman. ""It's third-world conditions at their worst,"" complains the manager of a large block of flats whose tenants have been advised to leave until the lights are back on. Although some power has been restored to the city, two repaired cables failed during testing on March 4th. 
New Zealand's electricity is generated by two state-owned enterprises and transmitted by a third to retail companies such as Mercury. Angry Aucklanders accuse Mercury's bosses of sacrificing investment in new cables to boost profits to pay for the takeover of neighbouring utilities. Most people have been surprised to learn that the firm (now known as ""falling Mercury"") is controlled by one of New Zealand's biggest law firms, Russell McVeagh McKenzie Bartleet. The electricity reforms of the Labour government in the late 198os saw many power boards replaced by public or private companies. Mercury, however, emerged as a curious beast, theoretically owned on behalf of the public by the Auckland Energy Consumer Trust. Its directors are outnumbered five to four by appointees approved by Russell McVeagh. 
The highest temperatures since records began in 1855 have not improved tempers. Indeed, the heatwave may have caused the old cables to fail. Whatever the reason, the government is likely to reassess its next phase of electricity reform, which includes privatising the generating and distribution companies, in order to persuade New Zealanders that their lights and airconditioners will not fail again.

The three countries are the founders and signatories of a 1994 convention that is supposed to conserve stocks of the southern bluefin tuna, a fish much prized by lovers of Japanese sushi and sashimi. But even though the southern bluefin is considered by Australia and New Zealand to be an endangered species, a fleet of 65 Japanese fishing boats has set sail to catch more than the conservation agreement allows. 
On July 13th, after a protest to the Jap anese ambassador, New Zealand closed its ports to all Japanese tuna fishers. Australia had done likewise earlier this year. Both countries are angry at Japan's decision to begin an ""experimental"" programme to catch an additional 1,400 tonnes of southern bluefin in the southern stretches of the Indian Ocean. Japan already has a 6,065-tonne share of the total quota of 11,750 tonnes. 
The row has been simmering for months. During a visit to Tokyo in March, New Zealand's prime minister, Jenny Shipley, raised the issue with the now outgoing Japanese prime minister, Ryutaro Hashimoto. She argued that southern bluefin were an international resource and that Japan should stick to the agreement to allow stocks of the migratory fish to recover. Japan, however, claims there is no scientific evidence to show that the species is endangered. 
Many Australian and New Zealand tuna fishermen believe Japan has simply bowed to pressure for a bigger catch from its powerful fishing industry. The market for tuna is lucrative. A southern bluefin can fetch vim ($7,100) in Tokyo's fish market, and top specimens much more. Australian exports of southern bluefin are worth an estimated $A100m ($62m) a year and New Zealand's about a quarter of that. The idea of the convention is to create a healthy long-term future for the fishermen of all three countries. 
The issue could grow into wider trade row. A tuna war with Japan would be an awkward forerunner to a plan to create free trade in food products, which is supposed to be launched at the APEC summit in New Zealand in 1999.

Stockholm BERGGREN SIx Biological factors receive scant attention in your survey. Only women possess the ability to give birth and to nurse new human beings. That ""biology is destiny"" rankles many but it would be foolish to submerge basic, unalterable biological differences under ideological debate and econometric studies. 
So could men and women ever enjoy equal status in the workforce? Nine months gestation and subsequent recovery from giving birth is less than perfectly compatible with a full-time job outside the home. Men are not subject to this natural limitation, so should we be surprised that, other things being equal, they continue to be the favoured sex for many jobs? 
No reasonable person argues against equality of the sexes in general. But until the real differences between men and women are fully appreciated, plans for ""equalisation"" of the sexes in the family, workplace and elsewhere will ultimately be frustrated. Charlottesville, Virginia JAMES HEETDERKS

VITO TANZI 
Washington, DC IMF SIR-It is premature and illadvised to prescribe a highly experimental treatment to cure Japan's sick economy, for two reasons. First, traditional medicine-real institutional change, comprehensive deregulation, a clean-up of the banking sector and some well-chosen consumer spending incentives-has never been administered in the correct dose or for the right duration. 
Second, the unknown and potentially powerful side-effects of a sustained policy of deliberate inflation could easily make matters worse. It is naive to think that China will sit idly by as the yen depreciates against the dollar. This could unravel sO years of global trade co-operation as protectionist pressures mount in America and other developed countries, to resist the tidal wave of Asian exports. Japan has already endured eight years of irresponsible policy-making and has nothing to show for it. Given the risks of the ""credibly irresponsible"" policy suggested by Paul Krugman and others, would it not make more sense to apply three or four years of a conventional, well-tested and ""incredibly responsible"" policy first?

Upper Montclair, Montclair NewJersey State University Air mail Six-Robert Ayling's predictable response (Letters, July 25th) to your leader opposing the BA-AA alliance is flawed. The 267 slots that the European Commission has proposed be released would be insufficient to retain viable competition in the air transport market between Britain and America. This derisory number of slots, equivalent to 19 daily flights, would be split between Heathrow and Gatwick airports and then shared between six American and two British airlines. No airline would have sufficient slots to compete effectively with the high frequency levels offered by BA-An. Passengers would face higher fares and less choice. Therefore, the alliance should not be allowed to proceed under the terms proposed by the EU commission. STEPHAN EGLI Vice-president 
London Delta AirLines Back issues SIR-Institutional memory appears not to be your strong suit. You attribute the origin of the notion of ""Asian values"" (July 25th), as a positive force for development, to ""some Asians"" in ""the early 1990s"". In fact its origin was Roderick MacFarquhar in The Economist (February sth,1980). 
That you have forgotten this is dismaying, since his article was doubly important. First, although you had taken a lead in paying attention to Japan, other countries in the region and the generality ofgrowth were still not widely noticed beyond specialist circles. Second, at the time, this line of argument was fresh and bold. In particular, the insistence that economic analysis must be complemented by attention to political, social and cultural variables remains as true now as it was in 1980. 
Finally, the moral of this episode is to endorse a strand in Asian values ignored by your article. In my experience East Asians have a stronger sense of history than is now the case in the West It would be inconceivable for a Korean journal to so forget itself as you have done in this case. Shipley, AIDAN 
West Yorkshire FOSTER-CARTER Taxing questions SIR-You rightly tell European governments not to make such a fuss about ""harmful"" tax competition (""No harm done"", August Ist). But one can go further than encouraging them to control their spending. They say that tax competition leads to lower taxes on capital and higher taxes on labour, which leads to unemployment. This assumption should be challenged. Capital exists only because at some time in the past labour was applied to natural resources. Increase the future demand for capital (by taxing it less) and you increase the current demand for labour. In the long term the mix of taxes on labour and capital may make little difference to the proportion of labour in the economic resources used. 
RICHARD BARON 
London Institute of Directors Putting Britain first SIR-The late 1980s boom in Britain was fuelled, not followed, by inflation (""Britain's next recession"", July 25th). Chancellor Nigel Lawson's shadowing of the D-mark entailed heavy interventions by the Bank of England to sustain parity. His prime minister, Margaret Thatcher, preferred to let the pound rise against continental currencies, and watch the boom blow itself out. Instead, Britain joined Europe's exchange-rate mechanism with devastating effect on its real economy. No doubt that was the price to pay for the British government being able to take a seat at the negotiations on Europe's future, culminating at Maastricht. 
Next year, Europe will have very different foreign-exchange markets. A repeat of this past drama will only be avoided if Tony Blair and Gordon Brown focus first and foremost on the British economy, and worry about influence in Europe as a secondary consideration. Maybe that is what the chancellor means by taking Britain's economic interests into account on matters relating to Euroland. 
JONATHAN STORY Fontainebleau INSEAD Predictions of doom SIR-You raise doubts about the accuracy of econometric models in predicting currency crises (""The perils of prediction"", August Ist) but fail to acknowledge the most powerful aspects of these tools for today's investment community. 
Exact timing is far from the point of these models. Indeed, given the difficulty of incorporating key factors and the frequent time-lags in relevant data, it is understandable that the models are weak on predictions of timing. For example, based on almost any econometric model, the rouble should have collapsed by now-on April 24th, the J.P. Morgan ""Event Risk Indicator"" you cite assigned a 99.1% likelihood of a 10% currency fall over the next month. But how do we include in a model the potential rescue of Russia through an IMFled financing plan? 
High risks of devaluation are usually reflected in high interest rates on domestic instruments. For example, in Venezuela shortterm rates hover near 50%. In these situations, the models can prove very powerful. They can be used to estimate not only the probability of a currency jump, but also the new equilibrium level at which the currency might settle if such a jump should occur. With this information, we can calculate intervals for expected foreign currency returns on domestically denominated instruments with a high degree of confidence. 
Boston JAVIER KULESZ SIR-The peril of using models to predict currency crises is not that they will fail but that they will attract enough believers to become self-fulfilling. Predictions of doom, whether they are theoretically sound or not, will provide the final push to a crisis if enough speculators are acting on them. These are undoubtedly financial tools which the world is better without 
Hong Kong WILLIAM KwAN Christian tolerance SIR-Your analysis on the plight of Christians in the Middle East (""As christians vanish from their cradle"", July 18th) corrects an oftheard commentary on the region. Israeli sources frequently cite systematic Islamic persecution as the motive for flight. 
I served as director of the Pontifical Mission for Palestine (a Vatican agency) based in Jordan. In one country after another, I have found just the opposite. King Hussein, Yasser Arafat and even Saddam Hussein have been routinely supportive of Catholics and Orthodox Christians alike. They regard them as well educated, well connected foundations for the future. Where Christians do suffer discrimination it is that which occurs against a minority in most societies when people compete forjobs and housing. 
Outside Israel and Palestine, the recurring theme of departing Christians is their decades-long frustration over wars, totalitarian governments, depressed economies and inadequate social services. Their second-class status is the last straw. 
Inside Israel they cite these same issues despite an obviously thriving infrastructure and the facade of democracy. As Arabs they are not permitted to expand their own homes for additional children or even to secure property deeds. This subtle ethnic cleansing by bureaucratic methods defeats any hopes Christians have of building a future. 
We can beg for them to sacrifice and remain. Or we could upgrade our efforts for human rights from Muslim societies and the Israeli government. Hinesburg, 
Vermont WILLIAM CORCORAN Reliance in India SIR-I must take issue with the central theme of your article on Reliance (July 25th). You say that Reliance's competitive position depends partly on sheltering within a domestic Indian market protected by high import tariffs. 
This is fundamentally inaccurate. Reliance neither seeks nor needs tariff protection. The reasons why, in the short term, we prefer to remain focused on our domestic market are much more straightforward. First and foremost is the sheer scale of the opportunity within India-an economy with GDP growth forecasts of 6-7% over the next two years. As the expansion of the Indian middle class gathers momentum and disposable incomes rise, so our core markets expand at double-digit rates. 
Also there is little point in seeking to become a global player until the Indian government allows its domestically domiciled corporations full capitalaccount convertibility. The government has never freely allowed, and continues to control, the movement of capital overseas to acquire foreign assets. MATHEW PANIKAR Chairman 
London Reliance Europe Limited Six-Reliance is a company that, in a country where apparently it is the ""done thing"", has mastered the game of political relationships to the highest extent, whilst at the same time building a firstclass manufacturing infrastructure.

SIR-Your curmudgeonly portrait of Chung Ju Yung (Face value, February 6th) pays too little heed to, and misses the significance of, his final grand venture: a foray into North Korea. This is not just about charity. The economic complementarities of the two Koreas are akin to those between China and Taiwan, which now share $30 billion of investment and $20 billion of annual trade. 
The centrepiece of Hyundai's northern plans is an industrial estate slated to produce exports worth $4 billion annually-more than five times the current total.

Defending officials 
SIR-Bagehot (February 13th) sees something sinister in Tony Blair's defence of the civil servants who were criticised by the foreign affairs select committee over Sierra Leone. I disagree, for two reasons. 
First, it is patently true that the officials concerned were criticised unfairly, with full benefit from hindsight. The committee found them at fault for, among other things, failing to react to early press reports about the violation of sanctions on Sierra Leone-most crucially in March 1998. At the time, however, no one in the Commons seems to have appreciated the import of those reports; not even the Mrs on the select committee. It was a foreign office minister, Tony Lloyd, who first brought up the matter in debate (to his later regret). 
Secondly, and more generally, ministers have to defend civil servants. Otherwise they will be accused of hiding behind their officials. This is the lesson of the Parkhurst prison escape of 1995. Robin Cook was almost fried in the same oil when his first reaction to the Sierra Leone scandal was to dissociate himself from his officials. He had to change tack straight away, coming to their defence instead. Had Tony Blair simply accepted the committee's conclusions, similar accusations would no doubt have gone his way.

Artificial Belgium 
SIR-You have always been somewhat sceptical about Belgium's federalisation process. But few Belgians would call it ""a country divided ever more deeply and irritably"" between Flanders and Wallonia (Charlemagne, February 13th). 
Most foreigners tend to forget that Belgium is an artificial creation. If Napoleon had not been defeated at Waterloo, the 3m French-speaking Belgians would still be French. Had a small Brussels elite not succeeded in its 1830 rebellion, 6m Dutch-speaking Belgians would still be Dutch. The bilingual city of Brussels would have been what it is now, has always been and always will be: the capital of Flanders (legal or defacto), where one needs to know French to find a job, Dutch to keep it, and English to do it.

Atrocious America

Saddam is excoriated for killing thousands of his own civilians over the years and trying to topple the leadership of Kuwait in 1991. Yet the American and British enforced embargo has killed far more Iraqi civilians-through malnutrition and disease as well as illegal military attacks-than Saddam Hussein at his worst. 
Jackson's Point, HENDRIK Canada WEILER 
Seismic warning 
SIR-In your article on earthquake prediction (January 30th) you say that for the public and emergency services ""any warning is better than none at all."" In fact, no prediction is better than one that is misleading, mistaken, or misused. 
The case of earthquake prediction is perhaps the canonical example of why this is so. In the 1970s and 1980s optimism about the potential for prediction of specific earthquakes gave way to a more sober view of the challenge. The process showed that predictive knowledge was neither necessary nor sufficient for decision-makers to improve their response to earthquakes. Yet, scientists and policy makers continue to use disasters as justification for increased emphasis on predictive research. 
This addresses the political need to ""do something"", and for scientists it helps sell the need for more research. Predictions from the earth sciences bring tremendous benefits to society but only with compensating advances in society's ability to use this knowledge appropriately in the decision-making process.

Nathan's success 
SIR-Your review of Niall Ferguson's book ""The World's Banker"" (February 13th) gets it wrong on two fronts. Mayer Amschel, father of the five Rothschild brothers, was a dealer in rare coins, not antiques. More importantly, it was precisely because no other history had focused on the ""political, diplomatic and social"" scene in which he and his brothers established their banking operations, that Mr Ferguson was encouraged to do just that. The ""mechanics of their operations"" would not explain how Nathan Mayer and his four brothers were able to lay the foundation of the bank that exists today; the political and social environment of the 19th century does. 
Far from being a weakness, the attention to ""causes of wars, revolutions and so forth"" is key to understanding much of the early success of Nathan Mayer and his family.

No one is trying to bring the general to trial for his coup, but for the tortures and murders after it.

Paying a high price 
SIR-Your article on the British government's policy on retail pricing is long overdue (""Expensive"", February 6th). Kim Howells, minister at the Department of Trade and Industry, is keen on lower prices. This conflicts with a long-standing concern to protect town centres, currently championed by Richard Caborn, at the Department of Transport. 
However, promoting town centres protects inefficient, obsolete retailers by reducing the supply of developable land and the degree of competition between modern, efficient superstores. Restrictive planning policies in effect confer local monopolies on those out-of-town stores which have succeeded in slipping through the planning net.

Don't abandon Russia 
SIR-Your suggestion (""Russia, financial outcast"", February 6th) that Russia should be allowed to default and collapse is entirely wrong, as was your earlier sup port of an iF-led bailout. It was obvious that the money provided would soon be wasted through crony capitalism and economic mismanagement. It should now be clear that a comprehensive international effort is necessary to assist Russia in overcoming the most severe crisis in the post-communist world. 
Abandoning the Primakov government will lead to chaosnot only in Russia but for the rest of the world. As the current mess is as much due to ill-advised foreign advice over the last decade as to post-Soviet crony capitalism, responsibility must be shared by the international community and the G7. However, any assistance must be on the basis of tough conditionality, especially with regard to foreign-debt reduction, institutional reconstruction, and fighting organised crime and corruption. 
As former deputy premier of Poland and finance minister in 1994-97,Ican assure you that we were able to succeed. This was not only due to our sound policies and commitment to liberalisation, privatisation and structural reforms, but also because Poland was not abandoned by the world when its support was most needed. 
GRZEGORZ KOLODKO Visiting scholar 
Washington, DC IMF 
SIR-In the course of the past ten years Russia has gone through ordeals that can only be compared to those of Germany during the Weimar period. The West's policy for 400 years has always been to dismember, weaken and keep Russia friendless. All is well until a western country's nose is bloodied against Russia's elbow. 
Remember that Russia inherited the debts of the former Soviet Union but it is by Russia's effort that many of these people have learned how to read and write. Russia has also brought industrialisation and the possibility to live in civilised conditions. If the policies you advocate for Russia had been applied to Germany in 1945, I sincerely doubt Europe would be as prosperous as it is today. Soviet effort gave you the chance to apply those policies. 
In Afghanistan, during the Soviet presence, and in Chechnya, the West pumped millions of dollars to anti-government guerrillas. The payback has been ten years of civil war in one case and a beheaded westerner in the other. As the West dismembers Yugoslavia, another Slavic state, I give you some advice: ""look further than the end of your nose"".

Time lapse 
SiR-The basis for the exception for Time Canada (February 6th) in Canada's 1965 tariff barriers against ""split-run"" magazines was not the elephantine weight of our publication, as you say, but the fact that we had been publishing a Canadian edition for 22 years. A more draconian change in 1976 forbade Canadian advertisers in non-Canadian magazines-notably Time Canada-to deduct the cost ofthis advertising as a business expense. This protectionist measure is still in effect, and was not struck down by the recent WTO ruling. It is the main reason why most American-based magazines are unlikely to establish split-run editions in Canada.

Germany's states 
SIR-Your survey of Germany (February 6th) says that there are too many Lander and they make little geographical sense. You therefore favour some sort of ""rationalisation"". Would you favour similar changes in America, whose states have an average population of just 2-3% more than Germany's? 
The ""thoroughly unsatisfactory' fiscal arrangements, which guarantee a roughly equitable apportionment of German taxes among the 16 states, may provide ""disincentives for the Lander to grow richer and raise their own tax bases"". But such ""incentives"" do not seem to be all that effective in other nations without such redistribution. In America the expenditure per publicschool pupil in New Jersey is more than three times that in Utah. American children must choose their place of residence carefully to assure themselves a decent education-or better yet, attend a private school. German school children get an excellent public education no matter where they live.

America's pie 
SIR-Your article on foreign direct investment (""The trouble with mergers"", January 30th) seriously understates its overall contribution to America's economic welfare. True, the numbers employed by subsidiaries of overseas companies have remained steady for several years. However, this ignores reinvested earnings by these subsidiaries: close to $20 billion in 1997. 
Jobs supported by these subsidiaries tend to be in highskill/high-wage sectors of the economy. They offer compensation that is on average 13% higher than from business overall. Also, capital from abroad, as well as reinvestment by American subsidiaries, surely stimulates demand, contributes to the tax base and supports indirect employment. This all contributes to America's enviable current employment rate.

As the current mess is as much due to ill-advised foreign advice over the last decade as to post-Soviet crony capitalism, responsibility must be shared by the international community and the G7. However, any assistance must be on the basis of tough conditionality, especially with regard to foreign-debt reduction, institutional reconstruction, and fighting organised crime and corruption. 
As former deputy premier of Poland and finance minister in 1994-97,Ican assure you that we were able to succeed. This was not only due to our sound policies and commitment to liberalisation, privatisation and structural reforms, but also because Poland was not abandoned by the world when its support was most needed.

SIR-In the course of the past ten years Russia has gone through ordeals that can only be compared to those of Germany during the Weimar period. The West's policy for 400 years has always been to dismember, weaken and keep Russia friendless. All is well until a western country's nose is bloodied against Russia's elbow. 
Remember that Russia inherited the debts of the former Soviet Union but it is by Russia's effort that many of these people have learned how to read and write. Russia has also brought industrialisation and the possibility to live in civilised conditions. If the policies you advocate for Russia had been applied to Germany in 1945, I sincerely doubt Europe would be as prosperous as it is today. Soviet effort gave you the chance to apply those policies. 
In Afghanistan, during the Soviet presence, and in Chechnya, the West pumped millions of dollars to anti-government guerrillas. The payback has been ten years of civil war in one case and a beheaded westerner in the other. As the West dismembers Yugoslavia, another Slavic state, I give you some advice: ""look further than the end of your nose"".

Time lapse 
SiR-The basis for the exception for Time Canada (February 6th) in Canada's 1965 tariff barriers against ""split-run"" magazines was not the elephantine weight of our publication, as you say, but the fact that we had been publishing a Canadian edition for 22 years. A more draconian change in 1976 forbade Canadian advertisers in non-Canadian magazines-notably Time Canada-to deduct the cost ofthis advertising as a business expense. This protectionist measure is still in effect, and was not struck down by the recent WTO ruling. It is the main reason why most American-based magazines are unlikely to establish split-run editions in Canada.

Germany's states 
SIR-Your survey of Germany (February 6th) says that there are too many Lander and they make little geographical sense. You therefore favour some sort of ""rationalisation"". Would you favour similar changes in America, whose states have an average population of just 2-3% more than Germany's? 
The ""thoroughly unsatisfactory' fiscal arrangements, which guarantee a roughly equitable apportionment of German taxes among the 16 states, may provide ""disincentives for the Lander to grow richer and raise their own tax bases"". But such ""incentives"" do not seem to be all that effective in other nations without such redistribution. In America the expenditure per publicschool pupil in New Jersey is more than three times that in Utah. American children must choose their place of residence carefully to assure themselves a decent education-or better yet, attend a private school. German school children get an excellent public education no matter where they live.

America's pie 
SIR-Your article on foreign direct investment (""The trouble with mergers"", January 30th) seriously understates its overall contribution to America's economic welfare. True, the numbers employed by subsidiaries of overseas companies have remained steady for several years. However, this ignores reinvested earnings by these subsidiaries: close to $20 billion in 1997. 
Jobs supported by these subsidiaries tend to be in highskill/high-wage sectors of the economy. They offer compensation that is on average 13% higher than from business overall. Also, capital from abroad, as well as reinvestment by American subsidiaries, surely stimulates demand, contributes to the tax base and supports indirect employment. This all contributes to America's enviable current employment rate.

SIR-I would be more impressed by the argument calling for the extension of the droit de suite (February Uth) if it were accepted that the principle worked both ways. Buyers of highly-priced modern works of art, subsequently sold at a loss, could look forward to some compensation from the artist or his heirs. I can confidently predict some works that will fall into this category.

SIR-Jeffrey Sachs has not considered that more than merely saving lives those lives should be worth living (By invitation, August 14th). Many poor countries are experiencing explosive population growth, far beyond their ability to provide a decent standard of living. Much of this is due to the effect of modem science, for example in health and agriculture. In addition, through a variety of policies, many of these countries encourage large families. The result of unrestrained growth includes poverty, ignorance, starvation, illness and early death. Implementing Mr Sachs's proposals would add to the population problem, and could cause even more misery. 
If poor countries are not willing and able to control their pop ulation growth, and raise living standards, it may not be possible to convince the rich ones to make the effort to save them. 
DAVID SHELDON 
Toronto 
SIR-Both you and my colleague Jeffrey Sachs agree that a lack of access to new medicines, protected by product patents, is a big problem. As you say, it can have dramatic consequences for welfare. While mortality rates for AIDS patients have plummeted in America and Europe, in the poor countries they are at alarmingly high rates, because of lack of access to new AIDS medicines. 
Monopoly prices reap huge rents for multinational firms in rich countries-a major market failure for the poorest of the poor. While Mr Sachs proposes a global incentive fund for future vaccine development there are no ideas on how to expand access to existing new medicines. 
Pharmaceutical companies say that high monopoly rents on new medicines assure incentives for high-risk research on future pathbreaking medicines and pay for past efforts that resulted in failure. But the vast majority of those medicines (successes and failures) have little relevance to the disease patterns in the poorest countries. Where is the ethical justification for charging rich-country prices for the new medicines that are relevant to poor countries when the profits subsidise research on diseases that have little relevance to them? Substantial price reductions or even donations of welfare-enhancing new medicines for poor countries are called for. 
MICHAEL REICH 
Harvard School of Public Health 
SIR-The ""shock"" free market economic policies espoused by Mr Sachs directly contributed to the impoverishment of many in the former Soviet Union and Eastem Europe after the collapse of Communism; having him write on ""helping the world's poorest"" is laden with irony. Mr Sachs's thesis-that impoverishment in highly indebted poor countries (Hipcs) is more a product of climate and recent weather patterns than exploitation by wealthier nations-is quite a piece of theoretical obscurantism. It also does nothing to explain the large gap in high-income countries between rich and poor, with some of the latter living in conditions nearly as bad as those in the HIPCS, despite inhabiting more temperate climes. 
That said, I agree with the four propositions for economic improvement Mr Sachs outlines. After they are instituted, maybe we can stop using developing countries in the way they have been used by colonial economies for hundreds of years: for the mass plunder of resources and labour.

Profiting online 
SIR-In Internet retailing established companies do have certain advantages over pure web companies, including offline brand awareness, market clout, marketing firepower and already existing distribution and fulfilment systems (""The real Internet revolution"", August 2ist). However, a huge problem faced by bricks-- and-mortar companies trying to sell online is that they risk outpricing their other ""real world"" distribution channels. 
You say that the online operation of Toys ""R"" Us is in jeopardy. The problem that it faces is that it is unable to match the markdowns of other Internet upstarts such as eToys (which generally sells below shop prices) because such a strategy would undercut its network of franchisees around the country. Also, preferential pricing could foster resentment by store managers.

Korea's missile 
SIR-At last, someone has asked the obvious question (""Countdown"", August 21st). If this summer we have had weeks of warning that North Korea might test a missile, how could the one it launched a year ago have come as such a surprise? Then as now, American spy satellites watched North Korea's every move. 
Reports at the time claimed that the Japanese government had advance warning of last year's launch and tried to get North Korea to call it off. But why did the Japanese government choose not to alert its citizens? And why did America not shout it from the rooftops, as it has this time? There are two answers. The allies hoped to see what Kim Jong I1 had in his arsenal, and to scare Japanese public opinion out of pacifism and into endorsing closer defence co-operation with America. Both aims have been amply fulfilled. 
As to North Korea's motives, your verdict of ""totally unpredictable"" is too defeatist. Last year, they let off a big firework for their 50th birthday. This year, it is the old North Korean ploy of going out on a limb in order to be rewarded for later backing off. It works every time.

SIR-You say that the people of Halifax, Nova Scotia, have ""a useful lesson to teach the world"" about the passive smelling of perfumes and other scented toiletry products in public places (""Sense and non-scents"", August 7th) Unfortunately, your tongue-in-cheek comments suggest that you are unaware of a medical problem known as chemical sensitivity that increasingly complicates the lives of many people. 
For unfortunates who have developed this sensitivity a few seconds of smelling strong perfumes can cause severe physical reactions that may last for hours. A relative disaster might strike if a strongly scented person happens to be sitting in front of a chemically sensitive person on a bus, train or plane, and no alternative seating is available. I sincerely applaud the fine people of Halifax and can only hope that others become more aware that a pleasing scent for them may be anathema for another.

Voting for growth 
SIR-Your ""Politics brief' on direct democracy (August 14th) ignores a crucial aspect, namely its effect on the economy. Over the past decades scholars have carried out serious econometric cross-section studies, using the fact that the voters in the 26 Swiss cantons have different opportunities for undertaking popular referendums and initiatives. In some cantons, for instance, almost any issue can be brought to the vote. In others, the set of issues is more restricted, for example, it excludes the budget. 
The result of more extended participation rights for voters is striking: cheaper and more efficient provision of public services; lower debt per person; higher income per person; and, most importantly, a happier population. The causation does indeed run from direct democracy to these outcomes, not the other way round, and no other factors are responsible. Direct democracy is even more beneficial than you suggest. 
BRUNO FREY 
Zurich 
SIR-Democracy must be a means not an end, and that end is liberty. Untamed democracy is the enemy of liberty. The tyranny of a majority is as oppressive as the tyranny of a central committee. Direct democracy is not a good answer to any of our problems (however, as in California of late, it may be a necessary evil when elected politicians refuse to deal with difficult issues). 
Democracy must be surrounded by non democratic elements-- extraordinary majorities, executive vetoes, judicial review, constitutions, bills of rights, etc, to prevent it from becoming tyrannical. Tempered democracy is the surest instrument we have yet seen to ensure liberty. 
JOHN AHLSTROM

India's election 
SIR-The days of Jawaharlal Nehru, Indira Gandhi or even Rajiv Gandhi are over for the Congress party; it now exhibits signs of being a spent force (""The battle for India"", August 14th). Instead of being on the offensive during the run-up to the forthcoming parliamentary elections the party is expending lots of time and energy defending its nomination of Sonia Gandhi, a foreigner by birth, as the next prime minister of India. 
Sharad Pawar, a political heavyweight, left the Congress party weakening its stronghold in the premier state of Maharashtra. Ironically, the induction of Jayalalitha Jayaram, the ""erratic Tamil Nadu politician"", into an alliance has further diminished the party's credibility instead of compensating it for the loss of Mr Pawar because of a slew of corruption charges against her and her unprincipled role in bringing down a functioning government on unsubstantiated charges. 
In the final analysis, what works in India during election time is a sort of fuzzy logic not cold analysis. Atal Behari Vajpayee's Bjp-led alliance may win the elections not because of the military and diplomatic victory in Kargil, nor on account of low inflation in the Indian economy, nor even because his party is far less corrupt, but because of his skills as an orator and his frequent dalliance with mellifluous poetry in Hindi when he reaches out to the masses.

Youth-hostile 
SIR-I fail to see how America can be seen as having a youth-oriented culture (Lexington, August 14th). The country is dominated by repressive anti-youth politicians who have forgotten what it is like to be young. Too many of the 1960s baby-boomers have turned on their successors; one of them is in the White House. Bill Clinton launched a hysterical and hypocritical ""war on drugs""; supports the wearing of school uniforms and curfews on young people; and has used the power of the federal government against states wanting to lower the drinking age from a ludicrously high 21. 
Personal freedom is more important than the paranoid and petty-minded justifications for these curtailments of liberty. Sixteen-year-olds should be given the same rights as adults. 
MARK TAHA

SIR-Your article on the horrors of youth could not have been more appropriate at a time when the mainstream media flash stories which portray the youth of America as mysterious criminals with increasingly violent tendencies. As a i7-year-old, I am dismayed by the ongoing search for the causes of this ""new violence"" among children and teenagers. 
Perhaps the tabloids should search for the cause of violence among our adults. The real mystery is the motive behind such policies as America's support of governments who oppress their own people or the bombing of innocent civilians (which is somehow deemed both effective and humane).

Options for change 
SIR-You comment that option-- pricing theory is likely to replace the ""Capital Asset Pricing Model"" only when the majority of managers have doctorates in applied mathematics (Economics focus, August 14th). It would be a pity if this were true, as decision making in business is crying out for better financial tools. 
Much of the apparent complexity of current approaches to ""real-options analysis"" arises from the attempt to fit financial-- option formulae to real-world problems. Usually, this does not work as real-world options are often quite different from financial options. Option-pricing formulae are treated as a procrustean bed by academics: either the real world is simplified beyond recognition or unwarranted assumptions are added to make the facts fit the theory. Neither approach satisfies managers. 
There is an alternative. Simple financial models can capture the essence of option value by directly incorporating managers' existing knowledge of uncertainty and their possible decisions in the future. This approach avoids the dangers of complex formulae and unwarranted assumptions, and gives a lot more management insight than black-box formulae while creating less opportunity for academic publications. 
It seems a pity to dismiss a major advance in financial decisionmaking just because academia has not found ways to make it practical. 
STEPHEN BLACK 
Cambridge 
SIR-In theory, the greater the volatility in the price of an underlying asset, the more valuable the option to buy it. The greater the price variation, the greater the range of choice for the optionholder, and the greater his profit from choosing the right moment to buy. 
The world oil price fell 65% between October 1996 and December 1998. By July 1999 it had risen by i2%. Despite this increase in price variability, the values of various options-unimproved acreage, proved undeveloped reserves, exploration ahead of development-did not rise but apparently kept falling. 
This does not prove option theory wrong, but its limits are severe. When the price variability is not due to chance and may change for unknown reasons, we are, for now, back where we started: more uncertainty means lower values and less investment.

Digital and the BBC 
SIR-Your articles on the BBC (August 7th) fail to mention the most important reason why the additional licence fee for digital TV viewers should be rejected; we already pay extra to view digital TV. It is the analogue viewers who should be taxed; they watch TV free to air (except for the standard licence fee). To charge us more just because we are already paying more defies all logic or justice. 
That digital viewers rarely watch the BBC merely strengthens this sense of injustice. Viewers should have freedom to choose packages that do not include the BBC, and if they cannot receive the BBC they should not have to pay the licence fee. 
CHRISTOPH BLUTH

SIR-You suggest that the homes most likely to take digital services are more affluent and therefore politically more ""palatable"" for the government to tax. This assumption is misplaced. All the evidence from our tracking of the market shows that the homes most likely to have taken up digital TV (or intending to) are overwhelmingly traditional heavyviewing homes. The view that a digital tax would be largely sourced from the rich, enabling the government to ""get away with it"" is wrong; the tax will be mainly paid by ordinary families.

FOR a small, out-of-the-way country, New Zealand is getting a lot of attention. Its former prime minister, Mike Moore, has just taken over as head of the World Trade Organisation (WTO). Its foreign minister, Don McKinnon, is the front-runner to head the Commonwealth. And although New Zealand's plans for a bash to open the millennium have begun to unravel, celestial mechanics should guarantee that it gets there first. On September 12th and 13th, it was the seventh annual summit of the zi members of the Asia-Pacific Economic Co-operation forum that put New Zealand in the spotlight. 
As one of the region's most liberal economies, New Zealand was out to make the most of the summit. Although APEC accounts for some 60% of world trade and has a bold freetrade agenda, it has made little headway. After promising in 1994 to remove trade barriers by 2010 (or by 2020 for poorer members) the group had completed only a third of its tariff-cutting goals by the end of 1998. The main reason is an unfortunate conflict between business attitudes and WTo rules. 
The rules require any country that cuts tariffs to do so for all WTO members, not just a handful. So, if APEC members want to slash barriers to each other's trade, they must do so for other countries as well-including countries that are not part of the group and that offer nothing in retum. 
At last year's summit in Kuala Lumpur, APEC leaders backed away from a plan to cut their tariffs-on imports from within and outside the region-in 15 sectors, such as forestry, chemicals and toys. As APEC members dominate the sectors, not only would its consumers have benefited, but its exporters would have captured most of the additional gains. Since non-APEc countries would have gained as well, however, it was considered unfair and dropped. ""Last year's summit brought into focus just how important the wTo is,"" says Charles Finny, one of New Zealand's senior trade negotiators. Which could go to show how unimportant APEC is: Paul Krugman, a noted economist, has already labelled it ""an empty shell"". 
Undaunted, New Zealand's prime minister, Jenny Shipley, remains keen to give APEC some teeth. The trade agenda she presented to the assembled big cheeses, such as Bill Clinton and China's leader Jiang Zemin, was crafted to overcome APEC'S weaknesses in two ways: using New Zealand as an example of the gains that can come from one-way trade liberalisation, and trying to forge APEC into an effective free-trade lobbyist within the WTO itself. 
New Zealand has already exposed itself almost completely to world markets. Over the past 15 years, successive governments have eliminated all domestic subsidies, all export subsidies and most tariffs. The few that remain will be phased out by 2006. Apart from a free-trade agreement with neighbouring Australia, New Zealand has made these decisions unilaterally. 
Such boldness is still criticised by many New Zealanders, who denounce the vagaries of world commodity prices and the loss of factories to regional neighbours offering subsidies. The grumbles will continue into this year's general election, due to be held by early December. The biggest issues will be resistance to tax increases and complaints of an inadequate welfare state. The loss of educated workers to other countries-exacerbated by New Zealand's English-speaking workforce and its remoteness-is another worry. But it is hard to see how trade barriers would help any of these problems. 
After 15 years of liberalising, New Zealand's two main political parties show no signs of turning back. This week New Zealand announced a new free-trade deal with Singapore (exclusive free-trade areas are allowed under the WTO, provided that countries eliminate all trade barriers in almost all goods and services). Chile announced that it might soon join them. 
New Zealand relies heavily on agriculture, including food processing. The summit called for an ""open food system"", with more investment in rural infrastructure and the exclusion of food from economic sanctions. The main aim is to press for the elimination of export subsidies. By getting America and Japan to go along with it, New Zealand has thus ensured that the European Union will henceforth be totally isolated in the WTO. 
It will now be up to Mr Moore to make something out of what he called the ""dress rehearsal"" for the next WTo round, which begins in November. Mr Moore had better move quickly; the next two APEC hosts are two of the least liberal in the region, Brunei and China. ","Free - trading New Zealand was the perfect host for this year 's APEC summit . As for the guests ... 
 FOR a small , out - of - the - way country , New Zealand is getting a lot of attention . Its former prime minister , Mike Moore , has just taken over as head of the World Trade Organisation ( WTO ) . Its foreign minister , Don McKinnon , is the front - runner to head the Commonwealth . And although New Zealand 's plans for a bash to open the millennium have begun to unravel , celestial mechanics should guarantee that it gets there first . On September 12th and 13th , it was the seventh annual summit of the zi members of the Asia - Pacific Economic Co - operation forum that put New Zealand in the spotlight . 
 As one of the region 's most liberal economies , New Zealand was out to make the most of the summit . Although APEC accounts for some 60 % of world trade and has a bold freetrade agenda , it has made little headway . After promising in 1994 to remove trade barriers by 2010 ( or by 2020 for poorer members ) the group had completed only a third of its tariff - cutting goals by the end of 1998 . The main reason is an unfortunate conflict between business attitudes and WTo rules . 
 The rules require any country that cuts tariffs to do so for all WTO members , not just a handful . So , if APEC members want to slash barriers to each other 's trade , they must do so for other countries as well - including countries that are not part of the group and that offer nothing in retum .

Russia kept up its war on Chechnya, claiming it would take the capital, Grozny, by mid-December and had surrounded four-fifths of the city. However, Igor Ivanov, Russia's foreign minister, agreed to hold talks with an OSCE delegation visiting Moscow next month. Meanwhile, Ruslan Aushev, leader of neighbouring Ingushetia, sacked most of his ministers for failing to deal with an influx of 215,000 Chechen refugees. 
Members of the ruling party in Croatia rushed through an emergency measure to declare President Franjo Tudjman, who is seriously ill in hospital, temporarily incapacitated. Power now passes to the speaker of parliament. 
President Bill Clinton completed a five-day trip through south-eastern Europe. He was cheered in Turkey, jeered in Greece and adored again in Bulgaria and Kosovo. At an OSCE summit in Istanbul, a revised treaty limiting conventional forces in Europe was signed by both Mr Clinton and Russia's president, Boris Yeltsin, who then characteristically walked out. 
The death sentence for treason passed on Abdullah Ocalan, leader of the outlawed Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK), was upheld by a Turkish appeal court. His lawyers will now appeal to the European Court of Human Rights. 
Lord Archer was forced to step down as Tory candidate for mayor of London after it was revealed that he had fabricated an alibi for possible use in a libel action in 1987. 
Algeria's Islamists 
President Abdel Bouteflika's hopes for Algerian national reconciliation were dimmed when an unknown assassin killed Abdelkader Hachani, a moderate Islamist who had been trying to bring the FIS, the outlawed Islamist party, back into the country's political life. 
A compromise on the fate of the 13 Iranian Jews accused of spying for Israel seemed near after the hardline chief of Tehran's Revolutionary Court said that the National Security Council, a political body chaired by President Muhammad Khatami, had the right to put Iran's national interests ahead of any court ruling. Iran had been under strong western pressure, as a conviction for spying carries the death penalty. 
Islamists and liberals in Kuwait's parliament united to defeat, by 41 votes to 21, the ruler's decree giving political rights to women. The liberals are expected to reintroduce the same measure soon, in a more democratic format. 
Christian churches throughout the Holy Land closed their doors for two days in protest at Israel's decision to allow a mosque to be built close to the Basilica of the Annunciation in Nazareth. 
The Nigerian army sealed off a region in the Niger Delta where 12 policemen had been killed last week in communal fighting. Many civilians were reported killed during the army clampdown. 
The army way 
Abdurrahman Wahid, Indonesia's president, rejected demands by the army to impose martial law in Aceh to put down a separatist movement. It would only worsen the problem, he said. The planned referendum in the province, he added, would not be about independence but about the introduction of Islamic law. 
Nawaz Sharif made a formal appearance in a Karachi court, the first time he has been seen in public since being deposed as Pakistan's prime minister last month.

AFTER New Zealand's general election of 1996, nine weeks passed before a coalition government could be put together between the conservative National Party and the Populist NZ First party. That wobbled along until 1998 when the coalition split, and the National Party carried on as a minority government. The election on November 27th was rather more decisive. The Labour Party won 52 seats, which with the ii seats of the Alliance party, its leftleaning partner, will give it a workable majority in the 120-member Parliament. The National Party has 41 seats. New Zealanders seem to have mastered some of the intricacies of their German-style system of proportional representation, which had been blamed for producing the previous unstable government. Countries considering changing their first-past-the post system had been alan-ned by the results of the New Zealand experiment. They may now be reassured. Possibly. 
New Zealand was ready for change. For 15 years, first Labour, then National, had guided the country away from its egalitarian past. But the gap between rich and poor had widened too far for many New Zealanders. In recent years particularly, they had become increasingly disenchanted with the flinty policies of National's leader, jenny Shipley, who sought to make New Zealand intemationally competitive whatever the domestic cost. The new coalition, led by Labour's 49year-old Helen Clark, plans to increase the top rates of personal income tax, and assist poor families. many of the poorest are Maoris, who make up about 15% of New Zealand's population Of 3.6m. 
In her early years in Parliament, Ms Clark, fresh from teaching politics at Auckland University, was regarded as a left-winger. These days she is thought of as centrist. Labour for her is not the radical market-driven ways practised by the party in the 198os, but the policies of its kinder, socially caring founders. She insists there is more to life than the pursuit of wealth. She likes listening to opera, cross-country skiing and climbing mountains. 
Ms Clark comes to office as New Zealand moves out of a mild recession brought on by the Asian slump and two severe droughts. Her major challenge may be to curb the demands of the Alliance, which is eager to impose wealth taxes, rebuild the tariff walls lowered over the past decade, and expand welfare benefits. For the moment, the Alliance's Jim Anderton, delighted after waiting for 18 years to get his hands on power, is exuding co-operation, but financial markets are wary that he will want to tamper with the independence of the Reserve Bank in running monetary policy. Mr Anderton has made no secret that he wants to be minister of economic development, besides being deputy prime minister, and return to the interventionism that was anathema to the governments of the past 15 years. The tussle for economic power between Mr Anderton and Labour's Michael Cullen, expected to become finance minister, promises to be one of the more fascinating chapters in the life of the government.

THE government of Felipe Gonzalez is dying on its feet. Every week seems to bring some new cry of pain. Mr Gonzalez's opponents, in politics and the press, say that he must go. The prime minister, battered and weary, has already been pushed into calling an election next spring, a year before he legally had to. The conservative opposition easily won last summer's city and regional elections; it controls 17 of Spain's 20 biggest cities and won 11 of 13 regional votes. The end of an era is at hand. What went wrong for Mr Gonzalez, and what can the other lot do to put it right?
On the face of it, the answer to the first question seems simple. Spain's establishment is drowning in a sea of corruption. Ever since Mr Gonzalez's long-serving number two, Alfonso Guerra, had to resign in 1991 after a scandal involving his businessman brother, the government has tottered from one embarrassment to the next.
There was the row about illegal financing of the ruling Socialist party. There was the sudden departure from office, amid accusations of tax-evasion and other things, of a governor of the Bank of Spain. A righteous-sounding Socialist, picked to be Spain's first civilian head of the main police force, the Civil Guard, was accused of massive embezzlement and after a ten-month manhunt was tracked down and arrested in comically louche circumstances in Bangkok. Now reports about the financial dealings of the generally popular King Juan Carlos are sharpening the sense of concern.
Most dangerously for Mr Gonzalez, a dozen senior policemen and top Socialists, including a former deputy minister of the interior, have been charged with running death squads that killed at least 27 suspected Basque terrorists in the mid-1980s. Can this have happened without Mr Gonzalez's knowledge? He says he knew nothing. The senate has set up a commission to look into the matter. The Supreme Court has asked for parliamentary immunity to be lifted so that a former interior minister can be charged with collusion in the murders.
Few people think that Mr Gonzalez himself, even if he knew of the death squads' existence, ordered the killing of those Basques (and it should be added that many Spaniards, even on the left, think the dead men got what they deserved). Nor do most people think he himself has been corrupt, though many of his friends clearly were. But Mr Gonzalez was too close to the scandals for his authority to remain undamaged. His subsequent wrigglings have done nothing to repair the damage. The steady piling up of embarrassment has taken its toll. His friends say he may stand down even before the coming election, which is due in March.
How well it all began
That would be a wry end to his 13 years in office, a period longer than any recent European leader can claim except Germany's Helmut Kohl. Whatever his government's recent shortcomings, Spain has experienced a marvellous transformation since Mr Gonzalez became prime minister in 1982.
That was only seven years after the death of General Franco, and one year after an attempted military coup. Yet Mr Gonzalez, a lad of 40 when he assumed that heritage, will leave behind him a solidly democratic Spain. This is now a country that, a few wild-eyed Basques apart, sees elections as the right and proper way of changing governments. Francoism has become a dim memory, and yet there has been little persecution of old Francoists. The army is safely back in barracks. The government of Spain has been desirably decentralised, and the power transferred to the regions has made it harder for Basque terrorists to win new recruits to their anti-Madrid cause.
Not least, Mr Gonzalez's Socialist government has changed the nature of Spanish socialism. Most of the people around him now call themselves Social Democrats rather than Socialists, and say they belong to the ""centre-left"". They have a middle-class feel to them, which is not unconnected to the fact that Mr Gonzalez has been able to win four elections in a row chiefly because much of Spain's burgeoning middle class has so far been happy to vote for him.
In economics, Mr Gonzalez has junked much of the ideological baggage his party carried into office 13 years ago. His has been a truly free-market government-rigorously monetarist, hospitable to foreign investors, firm with the trade unions, gradually willing to privatise, a dutiful slaughterer of quite a few useless industrial dinosaurs. As a result, Spain's GDP has slowly crept up from 71% of the European Union's average in 1983 to 75% in 1994. After a bad recession made worse by carelessness, growth is back to 3% a year and 1995's inflation is likely to be no worse than about 4 1/2%. A recent United Nations report rated Spain ninth in the world for its ""quality of life"". Today's Spaniards live as long as other Europeans, with an average male life-span of 73.
Mr Gonzalez's achievements abroad are no less striking. He swept Spain into the European Community (partly on the argument that membership would help to keep Spain democratic), fought off the opposition of old-guard Socialists to win a referendum that brought the country into NATO, and allowed America to keep its military bases in Spain. Mr Gonzalez has opened Spain to the world. He has made Spain look modern, and helped Spaniards to relax.
So what went wrong?
The fall from those heights is not just the result of a string of. Other things have gone wrong, just as seriously. The Spanish government, rather like Britain's, mismanaged an economic boom in the second half of the 1980s. As the head of the securities and exchange commission puts it, ""Spanish society went a bit crazy in 1986-87. Everybody thought they could become billionaires."" The government failed to keep inflation under control. A lot of flashy firms, having borrowed too much, went bust. As the economy then contracted, unemployment and the public-sector deficit both shot up.
Worse, the economy has a number of structural weaknesses that the government has addressed too timidly, too late or not at all. Spain's labour market is expensively inflexible: firms wanting to shed workers often have to pay them 45 days' compensation for every year they have worked, one of the costliest pay-offs in Europe. As a result, an increasing number of Spaniards-more than a third, say the unions-are now hired on short-term contracts, which they do not like. The Spanish tax system badly needs modernising, but the government has yet to make a start on the job.
The blackest economic cloud hanging over Spain, though, is joblessness. The official figure puts unemployment at 22% of the workforce, the highest in the European Union, way ahead even of Finland's 17%. Even when you allow for people with jobs in the unofficial economy, surveys suggest that about 17% of adult Spaniards have no proper work. The state's generous help for the rural poor reduces the number prepared to go and look for work in the towns, which is anyway pretty hard to find. On any calculation, Spain's performance in this field is the worst in the West.
Nor has this produced the industrial discipline the theorist might have expected. Spain has the EU'S second-worst figure for days lost in strikes, after Greece. There have been angry riots over the closing down of uneconomic shipyards. And the growing economic gloom of the past few years is compounded by the fact that Spain has lately suffered its longest and worst drought in the whole of the century. This has hurt agriculture, which still provides work for a lot of people; and, since Spain is one of those south European countries where city workers like to think they can turn to their country cousins for help when times are hard, it deepens the general demoralisation.
All in all, after a splendid beginning, the Socialists find themselves battered by a series of storms they have not been able to cope with. It is hard to say what Spanish socialism now consists of. The party has adopted practically all the economic doctrines of the European centre, even of the centre-right. Its supporters like to say that theycare more about povertythan the opposition does, that they are more sensitive to the Basque and Catalan desire for a sense of regional identity, that they are a shade ""more European"". All these things may be true, but they are more differences of feeling than of hard policy. It is also true that many Socialists, asked what makes them Socialists, put ""religion"" at the top oftheir list: antipathy to the hierarchy of the Roman Catholic church remains strong. But that is not, in today's Spain, an issue likely to make much difference at the polls.
The original driving-force of Spanish socialism was anti-Francoism. The Socialists of those days were the party of democracy, tolerance, modernity. Now that those things are no longer at issue, Spain's socialism has become a matter of mood. This is why the scandals have so damaged the Socialists. Many Spaniards who came to political maturity in the post-Franco era are shocked by the cynicism the scandals have exposed. ""We Socialists were not supposed to be like that,"" says a literary lioness in Madrid. That is true, and it stings. The shape of the alternative
The Spanish right is now embodied in the People's Party (PP), led by Jose Maria Aznar, himself a relative lad of 42. His party has three main components.
There is the centre-right, which loves to use words like ""pragmatic"" and ""moderate"" about itself, and believes earnestly in consensus, and is in general rather like the more solemn segments of Germany's Christian Democrats. Next comes the residue of the old Francoist right-traditionalist, centralist, nationalistic in the old Castilian way, pro-church, still more than a touch authoritarian. And then there is the new lot, the economic liberals, some of whom call themselves ""Thatcherites"". These people are keen to reduce the size of the state and let the free market rip, zealous in attacking the growing culture of welfare dependency, no believers in boring old consensus.
The consensus-seeking centre-right is the largest single element in this mixture. Most people in Madrid who take an interest in politics reckon that, if the People's Party wins the coming election, the centre-right will try to insist on setting the government's course. This group's main characteristic, judging by what its leaders say, is caution. In the run-up to the election, it will take great care not to frighten voters who have yet to make up their minds.
Last time, Mr Gonzalez scared many
Spaniards into believing that the right intended to turn back the clock, grind the faces of the poor, and so on. The new centre-right stresses the democratic, middle-class mildness that used to be the Socialists' territory. It no longer follows the Roman Catholic church on divorce, abortion and homosexuality. Nor does it champion the merits of a centralised government.
It wants to reassure people on the edges of Spain, not least the large middle class of Catalonia, politically the most important of Spain's regions. ""I prefer the federal structure,"" says a would-be finance minister, rejecting the Castilian right's old fear that Spain's unity could be undermined by breakaway Basques and Catalans. Even an old-guard figure such as Manuel Fraga, a minister under Franco who led the PP'S immediate precursor, the People's Alliance, now espouses the cause of Gallego, the local dialect of Galicia, the region he governs. Many Spaniards doubt that the People's Party has entirely changed its ideas on this subject, but the party's moderates know that the risk of being called a bunch of Castilians is their Achilles heel. They will try hard not to let it bring them to the ground.
These centre-rightists also say they will press on with the economic reforms begun by the modernisers in the Socialist Party; they believe in privatisation, deregulation, monetary rigour. But they are consolidators, not revolutionaries.
It is true that the party's economists say the tax structure should be simplified, and the top rate cut from 56% to 40%. They want contributions to the social welfare budget, currently 28.3% of the basic salary (and almost entirely paid for by employers), cut by 5%. Property, corporation and enterprise taxes should go down, too. Transport, communications, energy and banking need to be more vigorously opened up to competition. The state airline, Iberia, needs a thorough shaking up. Labour should be made more flexible (ie, easier to sack). The number of ministries and the size of their staffs must be cut.
But on each point the spokesmen of the party take care to counsel caution. Changes cannot occur in the first budget. Pensions cannot be reformed ""too soon"". Taxes cannot be reduced, reasonably enough, until there is agreement on how spending can be cut. On a wide range of issues little seems to distinguish the mainstream of the People's Party from the Socialists. Many businessmen, still fond of the corporatist consensus, will not urge a new government towards radicalism of the right. ""Politicians don't want to create panic,"" observes a car maker, approvingly.
On foreign policy, the gap between the parties, says Javier Solana, the foreign minister, is ""zero . . . You need a microscope to see the differences."" Mr Solana admits that the People's Party might be ""a bit more Gaullist"". Certainly it sounds a shade more nationalist in defence of Spanish fishermen, and more determined to protect the country's dairy farmers. It might beat the drum harder on Gibraltar. But on the main issue, the future of the European Union, most of the leading figures in the centre-right section of the party sound little different from the Socialists. The possible next foreign minister, Rafael Arias Salgado, says his party is ""even more enthusiastic about a single currency"". The mystery of Mr Aznar
The centre-right, however, is not in undisputed command of the party. The traditionalist right, composed of the heirs of Franco and the guardians of church-blessed morality, still has a voice. Several would-be ministers, including the shadow justice minister, are said to be members of Opus Dei, a rightwing religious group. Since Spain has no serious, separate party of the far right, these people will stay inside the PP. But they are no longer strong enough to dominate it. Their followers will vote for Mr Aznar, but they will not be able to control him.
A more formidable challenge may come from the Thatcherites. It is hard to measure the size of this group, but its opinions are clear-cut. The Thatcherites have no time for Francoist economics. They want to move fast; the party cannot assume more than one four-year term in power, they say, so it cannot afford to tiptoe into serious reform. On social issues, they are generally libertarian. They are dismissive of what they see as the soggy fudge of German Christian Democracy. They are also wary of the idea of a federal Europe. Several of them are friends of Britain's half-Castilian minister of defence, Michael Portillo, an ardent Eurosceptic.
Another sign of vitality in the People's Party is its new openness to women and the young. The shadow ministers of agriculture, education and social security are all women. So are the PP mayors of Seville, Valencia, Saragossa and Malaga. Mr Aznar's wife is a power in the party.
No less important is the relative youth of many of the party's leading figures. A dozen years ago it was Mr Gonzalez who epitomised young, modern Spain. Now the Socialists' core constituency consists of the rural poor and nervous pensioners. The impatient young have swung to the right. This has had its effect on policy. The PP is readier than the Socialists to cut the length of time young conscripts have to spend in the armed forces; it might even abolish conscription altogether, and give Spain a small professional army instead. It is at least as interested as Mr Gonzalez's party in the environment, another thing that youth cares about. The Socialists have begun to look more conservative than the people who want to replace them.
Which strand of the PP will prevail if the party wins power? The conventional wisdom in Madrid has it that the apparently dull and cautious Mr Aznar, solidly unspectacular when he was head of the province of Castile-Leon before taking over the party leadership, is a natural consensus man. After the glitter of Mr Gonzalez, say many, Spain needs this unphotogenic, seemingly boring tax lawyer.
Mr Aznar is still a bit of a mystery. He has gained in confidence lately. His calmness and dignity after Basque terrorists narrowly failed to blow him up in Madrid last April were widely applauded. But he still keeps his cards close to his chest, though he has written (apparently without much ghosting) a respectable outline of his beliefs which suggests that he has been doing a commendable amount of reading of Karl Popper, David Hume and others. The battle for his mind continues.
Two big questions remain. One is about Spain's ""nationalities"": how, essentially, Mr Aznar proposes to deal with the Catalans and the Basques. If he fails to win an outright majority of seats in the next parliament, as is entirely possible, he will have to decide whether he wishes to buy the support of those regions' parties with a further devolution of power from Madrid.
The even bigger question concerns the economy. Although the People's Party has lately sounded so studiously moderate, Mr Aznar may decide that the economy's structural problems-with its tax system, the labour market, welfare, pensions, the banksare so severe that only brave and radical action as soon as he gets into office will have a chance of solving them. The Thatcherites think he is more attracted to their ideas than he lets on, and that he might become more adventurous once in power. ""I am a liberal, not a Thatcherite,"" he has said. ""Wait and see,"" the Hispano-Thatcherites retort.
The more cautious people in his party say that, if he is converted to radicalism, Mr Aznar will be taking a risk with Spain's newborn democracy, still too frail to stand the shock of drastic economic reform. The irony is that, if Mr Aznar decides to ignore these nervous colleagues, it will be because of what he inherits from Mr Gonzalez. his 13 years, Mr Gonzalez has overseen Spain's transformation into a firmly-rooted democracy that might, in fact, accept the painful measures which Spain needs at least as much as does the rest of Western Europe.
Post-Franco Spain has been, on the whole, a remarkable success. But it has not removed all the weaknesses of the Franco times, and Mr Gonzalez's Socialists have been in power long enough to have produced new flaws of their own. Spain needs something livelier, post-Gonzalez, than just a dutiful preserver of things as they are.",230,Spain,"After 13 years in power , Spain 's Socialists are almost certainly heading for the exit .

 Another sign of vitality in the People 's Party is its new openness to women and the young . The shadow ministers of agriculture , education and social security are all women . So are the PP mayors of Seville , Valencia , Saragossa and Malaga . Jose Maria Aznar's wife is a power in the party . 
 No less important is the relative youth of many of the party 's leading figures . A dozen years ago it was Jose Maria Aznar Prime Minister Aznar Mr Aznar who epitomised young , modern Spain . Now the Socialists ' core constituency consists of the rural poor and nervous pensioners . The impatient young have swung to the right . This has had its effect on policy . The PP is readier than the Socialists to cut the length of time young conscripts have to spend in the armed forces ; it might even abolish conscription altogether , and give Spain a small professional army instead . It is at least as interested as Jose Maria Aznar's party in the environment , another thing that youth cares about . The Socialists have begun to look more conservative than the people who want to replace them . 
 Which strand of the PP will prevail if the party wins power ? The conventional wisdom in Madrid has it that Jose Maria Aznar Prime Minister Aznar Mr Aznar party leadership , is a natural consensus man . After the glitter of Jose Maria Aznar Prime Minister Aznar Mr Aznar , say many , Spain needs Jose Maria Aznar Prime Minister Aznar Mr Aznar . 
 Jose Maria Aznar Prime Minister Aznar Mr Aznar is still a bit of a mystery . Jose Maria Aznar Prime Minister Aznar Mr Aznar has gained in confidence lately . Jose Maria Aznar's calmness and dignity after Basque terrorists narrowly failed to blow Jose Maria Aznar Prime Minister Aznar Mr Aznar up in Madrid last April were widely applauded . But Jose Maria Aznar Prime Minister Aznar Mr Aznar still keeps Jose Maria Aznar's cards close to Jose Maria Aznar's chest , though Jose Maria Aznar Prime Minister Aznar Mr Aznar has written ( apparently without much ghosting ) a respectable outline of Jose Maria Aznar's beliefs which suggests that Jose Maria Aznar Prime Minister Aznar Mr Aznar has been doing a commendable amount of reading of Karl Popper , David Hume and others . The battle for Jose Maria Aznar's mind continues . 
 Two big questions remain . One is about Spain 's "" nationalities "" : how , essentially , Jose Maria Aznar Prime Minister Aznar Mr Aznar proposes to deal with the Catalans and the Basques . If Jose Maria Aznar Prime Minister Aznar Mr Aznar fails to win an outright majority of seats in the next parliament , as is entirely possible , Jose Maria Aznar Prime Minister Aznar Mr Aznar will have to decide whether Jose Maria Aznar Prime Minister Aznar Mr Aznar wishes to buy the support of those regions ' parties with a further devolution of power from Madrid . 
 The even bigger question concerns the economy . Although the People 's Party has lately sounded so studiously moderate , Jose Maria Aznar Prime Minister Aznar Mr Aznar may decide that the economy 's structural problems - with its tax system , the labour market , welfare , pensions , the banksare so severe that only brave and radical action as soon as Jose Maria Aznar Prime Minister Aznar Mr Aznar gets into office will have a chance of solving them . The Thatcherites think Jose Maria Aznar Prime Minister Aznar Mr Aznar is more attracted to their ideas than Jose Maria Aznar Prime Minister Aznar Mr Aznar lets on , and that Jose Maria Aznar Prime Minister Aznar Mr Aznar might become more adventurous once in power . "" Jose Maria Aznar Prime Minister Aznar Mr Aznar am a liberal , not a Thatcherite , "" Jose Maria Aznar Prime Minister Aznar Mr Aznar has said . "" Wait and see , "" the Hispano - Thatcherites retort . 
 The more cautious people in Jose Maria Aznar's party say that , if Jose Maria Aznar Prime Minister Aznar Mr Aznar is converted to radicalism , Jose Maria Aznar Prime Minister Aznar Mr Aznar will be taking a risk with Spain 's newborn democracy , still too frail to stand the shock of drastic economic reform . The irony is that , if Jose Maria Aznar Prime Minister Aznar Mr Aznar decides to ignore these nervous colleagues , it will be because of what Jose Maria Aznar Prime Minister Aznar Mr Aznar inherits from Jose Maria Aznar Prime Minister Aznar Mr Aznar . Jose Maria Aznar's 13 years , Jose Maria Aznar Prime Minister Aznar Mr Aznar has overseen Spain 's transformation into a firmly - rooted democracy that might , in fact , accept the painful measures which Spain needs at least as much as does the rest of Western Europe . 
 Post - Franco Spain has been , on the whole , a remarkable success . But it has not removed all the weaknesses of the Franco times , and Jose Maria Aznar's Socialists have been in power long enough to have produced new flaws of their own . Spain needs something livelier , Jose Maria Aznar Prime Minister Aznar Mr Aznar , than just a dutiful preserver of things as they are .",PRE TERM,True,True

Opinion polls give his PP a fairly comfortable six-to-ten percentage-point lead over the ruling Socialists. And on March 3rd, when Spain has a general election, he is fancied to break the Socialists' 13-year hold on power and become the first full-blooded conservative leader since Generalissimo Franco died in 1975.
But Mr Aznar should not count his chickens. He has been beaten twice by Felipe Gonzalez, who has been prime minister for 13 years and remains a formidable campaigner. And Mr Aznar still wants to show that he can do more than ride to power on a wave of Socialist unpopularity: he wants to win the arguments. If, as is possible, he fails to win an outright majority in parliament, his government will be hobbled by the need to bargain with regional parties from Catalonia and perhaps the Basque country. And even with a handsome majority, it is unclear how radical he would dare to be.
He has promised austerity, an end to corruption and the start of what he calls Spain's ""second transition"" (the first was the move to democracy in the first postFranco years). ""Spain has had enough charisma,"" he says, referring to Mr Gonzalez. So he must hope: a former tax inspector, Mr Aznar hides his charisma well. But young and middle-class voters seem to like him.
On social issues, he does not sound very different from the Socialists, though some Spaniards fear that the PP's traditionalists, spurred on by the Opus Dei religious group, might press for restrictions on abortion and more religious instruction in schools. One of Mr Aznar's achievements, so far, is to have welded together Christian Democrats, economic liberals and the remnants of Spain's autocratic right into a moderate, modern-European centre-right. But he has done so by imposing strict control within his party-at the cost of stifling debate. If Mr Aznar wins, differences within could burst into the open.
A future Aznar-led cabinet might, for instance, contain a foreign minister who favours European federalism and a finance minister sceptical of European monetary union. But the argument most likely to break out soonest is over how to tackle Spain's economy. The markets may punish Mr Aznar if, within three months or so of coming to power, he fails to cut spending, make labour markets more flexible and open up protected sectors such as energy, transport and telecoms.
Not so easy. Spain's economy grew last year by around 3%, but it meets none of the criteria laid down in the Maastricht treaty.

The PP's probable economic supremo, Rodrigo Rato, says that the top rate of income tax can eventually be cut from 56% to 40% by making sure that tax dodgers, especially rich ones, pay up. He would also bring down employers' taxes but says that a PP government would not touch pensions. Social-service spending would simply grow more slowly.
Mr Aznar is still clutching most of his cards tightly to his chest. He knows that Spain has become used to consensus and still shudders at the memory of civil war. So he has promised to consult Spain's labour unions and employers as soon as he is elected.

Next, Jose Maria Cuevas, head of the employers' association and another erstwhile ally of Mr Gonzalez, followed suit. Then, almost as unkindly, his old friend and former finance minister, Miguel Boyer, went slap against Socialist policy by daring to suggest that joining Europe's monetary union in 1999 is not such a brilliant idea after all.

Mr Gonzalez's main problem is that he has nothing much new to offer, except to defend his record in office-which is patchy.

As in 1993, Mr Gonzalez is banking, in the end, on fear to drive voters back into his arms. He is playing on worries that rightwing authoritarians in the PP might roll back 13 years of modernisation and even try to undo some of the decentralising reforms which have gone far to assuage sentiment in Spain's regions, especially among the Catalans and Basques.

Both men are wary of the Spanish right's traditional tendency to concentrate power at the Castilian centre. They also fear a more sceptical attitude to Europe: they, especially Mr Pujol, have cleverly solicited European help for their regions and have even hinted at switching allegiance one day from Madrid to Brussels.

Mr Gonzalez's assurance that he will not, if the PP wins most votes, deprive it of power by ganging up with regional parties has helped make them less extravagant in their claims.
A PP government would not, in any event, be all that hostile to the regions.

Basques are different from Catalans. They tend to be more emotional and romantic and fundamentalist in their nationalism, whereas Catalans are more cautious and money-minded and pragmatic. Mr Arzallus and Mr Pujol typify that contrast. A more striking difference, of course, is that a lot of Basques-about 15% in the last election-back a party that endorses ETA, the Basque terrorist movement, which showed its teeth again this week by shooting dead a former head of Spain's Constitutional Court in his Madrid office.

FOR two decades Spain has been one of Europe's stirring success stories. The transition to democratic government, after the death in 1975 of dour Generalissimo Franco, went smoothly enough. Half a century after a bloody civil war and 15 years after an attempted military coup, Spain has a solid democracy and an economy that, with vigorous pruning, could be sturdy enough to meet the challenges ahead. For this, Felipe Gonzalez, reigning Socialist prime minister for 13 years but likely loser in the general election on March 3rd, deserves much credit. How could Spain manage without him?
Under Mr Gonzalez's guidance, the Socialists tossed away the past and reinvented themselves as free-market social democrats. Inward-looking, suspicious, austere Spain became outgoing, cosmopolitan and relaxed. It joined what is now the European Union and NATo. At home, the power of the old Castilian centre has sensibly been curbed. The outer regions, most importantly Catalonia and the Basque country, have been given enough autonomy to satisfy all but the most fanatical of separatists. Class-warring egalitarians on the left and corporatists on the right have been marginalised. Some of this had begun before Mr Gonzalez won power. But he deserves thanks for seeing it through.
That said, however, his government has long been dying on its feet. A string of scandals has brought to light massive corruption and worse. A former interior minister is accused of overseeing death squads that killed more than a score of suspected Basque terrorists-several of whom turned out to be innocent. Mr Gonzalez has lost the nation's trust, not because he is thought to be mired personally, but because he has seemed negligent towards the wrongdoing of his cronies.
Meanwhile, Mr Gonzalez's many achievements have been increasingly overshadowed by his failure to tackle the deeper structural problems of Spain's economy. Although some figures do not look too bad-after a fierce recession in the early i99os, growth is back to about 3% a year and inflation is down to 4%-Spain has the highest unemployment rate in Europe and a welfare and pensions system that consumes an ever growing proportion of its budget. If the next government is to tackle all that, and stay within shouting distance of the criteria for joining a future European economic and monetary union, then privatisation and deregulation need to be speeded up, stifling labour laws need to be axed and the mess which masquerades as Spain's tax system has to be sorted out.
But Mr Gonzalez and his government are clean out of ideas. If opinion polls are to be believed, their time is now up (see page 52). Certainly, Spain could use a less winded leader, a new government, and a fresh spirit of reform.
Spain's likely next prime minister,Jose Maria Aznar, who leads the People's Party, lacks anything like the Gonzalez charisma. A strikingly unflashy former tax inspector, his very ordinariness has helped convince Spaniards that his party has exorcised both its anti-democratic, Francoist past and the old Castilian authoritarianism. If Mr Gonzalez recreated the Socialists as a party of the centre-left, Mr Aznar's party now smells rosily of the moderate, pragmatic centre-right.
Will Aznar do better?
But there, for Mr Aznar and for Spain, is the rub. The right may be about to wrest power from Mr Gonzalez's weakened Socialists because it is no longer frightening. In the long run, however, that is not enough. In the past year or so, as the Socialists have destroyed themselves, Mr Aznar has cannily held his economic cards close to his chest. But if he is to succeed as Spain's prime minister over the next four years, he will need to find the steel to push through radical measures which, in the short run at least, will cause Spaniards even more economic pain than many of them already feel. And if he can do that, can Spain, its social fabric already stretched by unemployment and economic uncertainty, take it? Again, it is much to Mr Gonzalez's credit that Spain probably can.",230,Spain,"A strong democracy , Spain now needs a reformed economy 
 FOR two decades Spain has been one of Europe 's stirring success stories . The transition to democratic government , after the death in 1975 of dour Generalissimo Franco , went smoothly enough . Half a century after a bloody civil war and 15 years after an attempted military coup , Spain has a solid democracy and an economy that , with vigorous pruning , could be sturdy enough to meet the challenges ahead . For this , Felipe Gonzalez , reigning Socialist prime minister for 13 years but likely loser in the general election on March 3rd , deserves much credit . How could Spain manage without him ? 
 Under Mr Gonzalez 's guidance , the Socialists tossed away the past and reinvented themselves as free - market social democrats . Inward - looking , suspicious , austere Spain became outgoing , cosmopolitan and relaxed . It joined what is now the European Union and NATo . At home , the power of the old Castilian centre has sensibly been curbed . The outer regions , most importantly Catalonia and the Basque country , have been given enough autonomy to satisfy all but the most fanatical of separatists . Class - warring egalitarians on the left and corporatists on the right have been marginalised . Some of this had begun before Mr Gonzalez won power . But he deserves thanks for seeing it through . 
 That said , however , his government has long been dying on its feet . A string of scandals has brought to light massive corruption and worse . A former interior minister is accused of overseeing death squads that killed more than a score of suspected Basque terrorists - several of whom turned out to be innocent . Mr Gonzalez has lost the nation 's trust , not because he is thought to be mired personally , but because he has seemed negligent towards the wrongdoing of his cronies . 
 Meanwhile , Mr Gonzalez 's many achievements have been increasingly overshadowed by his failure to tackle the deeper structural problems of Spain 's economy . Although some figures do not look too bad - after a fierce recession in the early i99os , growth is back to about 3 % a year and inflation is down to 4%-Spain has the highest unemployment rate in Europe and a welfare and pensions system that consumes an ever growing proportion of its budget . If the next government is to tackle all that , and stay within shouting distance of the criteria for joining a future European economic and monetary union , then privatisation and deregulation need to be speeded up , stifling labour laws need to be axed and the mess which masquerades as Spain 's tax system has to be sorted out . 
 But Mr Gonzalez and his government are clean out of ideas . If opinion polls are to be believed , their time is now up ( see page 52 ) . Certainly , Spain could use a less winded leader , a new government , and a fresh spirit of reform . 
 Jose Maria Aznar's , lacks anything like the Gonzalez charisma . A strikingly unflashy former tax inspector , Jose Maria Aznar's very ordinariness has helped convince Spaniards that Jose Maria Aznar's party has exorcised both its anti - democratic , Francoist past and the old Castilian authoritarianism . If Mr Gonzalez recreated the Socialists as a party of the centre - left , Jose Maria Aznar's party now smells rosily of the moderate , pragmatic centre - right . 
 Will Jose Maria Aznar Prime Minister Aznar Mr Aznar do better ? 
 But there , for Jose Maria Aznar Prime Minister Aznar Mr Aznar and for Spain , is the rub . The right may be about to wrest power from Mr Gonzalez 's weakened Socialists because it is no longer frightening . In the long run , however , that is not enough . In the past year or so , as the Socialists have destroyed themselves , Jose Maria Aznar Prime Minister Aznar Mr Aznar has cannily held Jose Maria Aznar's economic cards close to Jose Maria Aznar's chest . But if Jose Maria Aznar Prime Minister Aznar Mr Aznar is to succeed as Spain 's prime minister over the next four years , Jose Maria Aznar Prime Minister Aznar Mr Aznar will need to find the steel to push through radical measures which , in the short run at least , will cause Spaniards even more economic pain than many of them already feel . And if Jose Maria Aznar Prime Minister Aznar Mr Aznar can do that , can Spain , its social fabric already stretched by unemployment and economic uncertainty , take it ? Again , it is much to Mr Gonzalez 's credit that Spain probably can .",PRE TERM,True,True

Not only do opinion polls suggest he will lose a general election on that day to the conservative People's Party (rr), led by Jose Maria Aznar, but his Socialists may even get shunted into second place in the regional parliament of his backyard, the once impregnable Socialist fief of Andalusia. After more than 13 years in power, Mr Gonzalez has lost his charisma and his political touch.
Felipe, as he is universally known in Andalusia, has tried to look after his own, investing more than 1,000 billion pesetas ($8 billion) in infrastructure there since he came to power in Madrid. Yet unemployment, at a full third of the workforce, is 10% higher than the official figure in Spain as a whole. Meanwhile the once-solid Socialist vote is splitting, as it is elsewhere in Spain: old people, unemployed and rural folk, nervous that a conservative government might cut welfare, remain stubbornly loyal. But the young and the goahead, especially in towns, are thirsting for change.
Throughout the general election campaign Mr Gonzalez has put in a defensive, lacklustre performance. His heart is not in it. He has been demoralised by the assassination of two close allies during the campaign. His panache on the hustings has always been the Socialists' trump card. Yet this time he has been heavily criticised for promoting a campaign video which crudely depicts the PP as fascist-style oppressors. The Socialists could be pulled further down by a good showing from the United Left, mainly former communists, who won 9.6% last time round, in 1993.
By contrast, the increasingly confident Mr Aznar, who has doggedly presented his party as middle-of-the-road, comes across as intense, clean and efficient. If opinion polls are to be believed, he might win an outright majority in parliament, thus relieving him of the need to bargain with Catalan and other regional parties.
The economy has been foremost in most voters' minds. Having watched the rough ride given in recent months to Alain Juppe, France's prime minister, in his attempt to introduce welfare reform, Mr Aznar has promised not to launch a similar wholesale attack on Spain's equally bloated system. He says he will not touch pensions. An array of other benefits will, he says, be safe. Instead, if elected, he will immediately ""consult"" trade unions and employers. ""Social cohesion is guaranteed,"" he told an audience of Catalan businessmen.
Still, if Spain is to meet the criteria for economic and monetary union set out in the Maastricht treaty, as prime minister Mr Aznar would have to try to halve the budget deficit, currently 5.9% of GDP, over the next three years and bring down inflation. He would also need to kill or sell off more of Spain's state industries, a left-over of Francoist corporatism and protectionism, and reform the country's labour laws. Meanwhile Mr Aznar promises tax cuts, arguing unconvincingly that he can find the revenue largely by making government ""more efficient"". And all this, while somehow reducing unemployment .
Privately, Mr Aznar knows that these hopeful assurances do not add up. If he wins the election, expect him to declare that the situation is even worse than he had realised. With a four-year mandate ahead of him, the period straight after the election would be the best moment to start dishing out the nastiest medicine. But he will need a lot of nerve.
Nor is it really clear where Mr Aznar stands on Europe. On the whole, the conservatives have sounded as keen as the Socialists to be ""good Europeans"". Mr Aznar pays lip-service to the current timetable for economic and monetary union by 1999. Once in office, he may well prove more sceptical. He has already accused Mr Gonzalez of being too keen on European integration, at a cost to national pride and interests. He would probably like the Maastricht timetable to be slowed down. And he is irritated bywhat he senses to be tacit support for Mr Gonzalez from Helmut Kohl, the German chancellor.
Terrorism has also become a campaign issue. The Basque terrorist group, ETA, currently holds two kidnap victims and has carried out two assassinations in the past fortnight. If the conservatives win, the terror could increase. Mr Aznar has made it plain he wants to govern without Catalan and Basque nationalist support. That has hurt regional sensibilities-and could even revive support for terror on the Basque nationalist fringe. With ETA under the command of new, young and relentlessly violent leaders, the chances of a conservative government being able to win a negotiated settlement are zero. Yet Mr Aznar might shrewdly hope to quell unease by tapping a respected Basque as his interior minister.
As for the non-violent Basque and Catalan parties, a victorious Mr Aznar might be urged to offer them a pact (though not a place in government) along the lines of the one he says he will offer to the trade unions and employers. He is unlikely to want to start off in government with both the centre-left and the nationalists lined up against him. But tactics is one thing, backbone another. If he is to govern Spain well, Mr Aznar will need both.",230,Spain,"Jose Maria Aznar Prime Minister Aznar Mr Aznar may be hit by a double blow on March 3rd .

AN ERA may have ended. Spain's Socialists, for the time being, are out. But the heralded new dawn of conservatism, let alone radical conservatism, is not at hand. Worse for Spain, the country may now enter a period of weak and wishy-washy government, with parties and factions vying for advantage, terrorists and regionalists stirring the pot, and no person and no new set of ideas emerging as the dynamo for rejuvenating the country. Once again, a Spanish prime minister at the head of the largest party is likely to be yanked this way and that by a canny provincial boss concerned more with the fate of Catalonia than the fate of Spain. The likeliest outcome: fuzziness and drift. Spain, as a result of the election on March 3rd, has lost.
Numerically, there was indeed a winner. Jose Maria Aznar and his conservative People's Party won 38.9% of the votes and 156 seats against Felipe Gonzalez and his Socialists, who took 37.5% of the vote and 141 seats. That was victory, of a kind, for the right. It was, after all, the first time in Spanish history that straightforward conservatives (as opposed to the technocrats who ruled Spain in the immediate transition to democracy after General Franco's death in 1975) had ever been freely elected.
But it was a big disappointment for Mr Aznar, who, had the opinion polls been right, would have won an outright majority in the Cortes's 350-seat lower house. Instead, he fell 20 seats short. The margin of Mr Aznar's victory was so narrow that he has immediately been sucked into the messy business of deal-making with the cleverest horse-trader in Spanish politics: Jordi Pujol, who has run Catalonia for nearly two decades and whose 16 seats could, if he wanted, deprive Mr Aznar of the vote of confidence he will need to form a government.
Even those Catalan seats might not be enough to enable Mr Aznar to govern. He also needs a clutch of Canary Islanders to keep him going. If they do not co-operate, there are a handful of moderate Basques, a couple of Galicians and a lone Valencian to be kept in play.
In theory, Mr Gonzalez could still try to cobble together a coalition of his own (though he and the mainly ex-communist United Left, which won 10.6% of the vote and 21 seats, have sworn not to canoodle with each other), which could deny Mr Aznar his working majority and even present itself as a ruling alternative. In fact, Mr Gonzalez seems to have accepted the people's dismissal. Now his most likely aim is to watch Mr Aznar from the sidelines, chuckling as the new man ties himself in knots trying against the odds to run a coherent government.
The key, though, is once again Mr Pujol. After Mr Gonzalez won the 1993 election without securing an outright majority, the Catalan leader made a pact with him, whereby Mr Pujol propped up the minority government but refused to form a coalition. Then, as the corruption and other scandals plaguing the Socialists got out of hand, Mr Pujol felt obliged to withdraw his support altogether. Mr Aznar is now looking glumly at a similar deal. Mr Pujol will make him sweat. Mr Aznar could look bedraggled before he has even entered the prime minister's palace.
In economics, he and the businessminded Mr Pujol can probably come to terms, though he is less likely to back radical policies for which he would then have to share the inevitable unpopularity, at least in the short term. On constitutional matters, however, co-operation between Mr Aznar and Mr Pujol will be even trickier. The Catalan is bound to seek ever greater concessions for his fief, in such matters as revenue raising. Mr Aznar is already offering to bargain over tax. Yet his Castilian core constituency already thinks the regionalists have been getting so much autonomy that the fabric of the Spanish state is threatened.
The poker could go on for weeks. King Juan Carlos, who has a delicate job on his hands, will give Mr Aznar about a month to find enough votes to give him an absolute majority of the whole of the lower house of the Cortes needed to install a new government. Failing that, a second vote within a few days, with a majority merely of those voting, would be enough to endorse a new government. The Catalans might abstain, allowing Mr Aznar to form a government, but a limp one.
The puzzle of the election is why Mr Gonzalez, with unemployment officially stuck at 23% and his government mired in corruption, did as well as he did. The result, in the end, testifies to Mr Gonzalez's enduring appeal to those in the bottom half of the Spanish pile. Despite the shakiness of its economy, the Socialists even managed to win a regional election in Mr Gonzalez's backyard, Andalusia. With left-wing parties still corralling more than half the vote nationwide, the heart of Spain still, it seems, beats a shade to the left of centre.
And why did Mr Aznar not do better? Many Spaniards were evidently not reassured by his protestations that the new Spanish right has exorcised the ghosts of the authoritarian past. The rural poor and the elderly were worried that the right might cut welfare. Many people in the outlying regions, especially Basques and Catalans, still suspect that the right wants to shut them up. Despite the rise of a middleof-the-road urban middle class, perhaps Spain is still more a country of two nations than commentators in Madrid had cared to admit.
The upshot is threefold. Spain's new government is likely to be weak. Radical reform is likely to be postponed. And Spain will miss an early chance to shape up as a competitive country in 21st-century Europe. A new election, perhaps within the year, might be a way out, though it might produce the same result. Meanwhile, politicians in Madrid are already muttering darkly about the ""Italianisation of Spanish politics"".

 In economics , Jose Maria Aznar Prime Minister Aznar Mr Aznar and the businessminded Mr Pujol can probably come to terms , though Jose Maria Aznar Prime Minister Aznar Mr Aznar is less likely to back radical policies for which Jose Maria Aznar Prime Minister Aznar Mr Aznar would then have to share the inevitable unpopularity , at least in the short term . On constitutional matters , however , co - operation between Jose Maria Aznar Prime Minister Aznar Mr Aznar and Mr Pujol will be even trickier . Jose Maria Aznar Prime Minister Aznar Mr Aznar is bound to seek ever greater concessions for Jose Maria Aznar's fief , in such matters as revenue raising . Jose Maria Aznar Prime Minister Aznar Mr Aznar is already offering to bargain over tax . Yet Jose Maria Aznar's Castilian core constituency already thinks the regionalists have been getting so much autonomy that the fabric of the Spanish state is threatened . 
 The poker could go on for weeks . King Juan Carlos , who has a delicate job on his hands , will give Jose Maria Aznar Prime Minister Aznar Mr Aznar about a month to find enough votes to give Jose Maria Aznar Prime Minister Aznar Mr Aznar an absolute majority of the whole of the lower house of the Cortes needed to install a new government . Failing that , a second vote within a few days , with a majority merely of those voting , would be enough to endorse a new government . The Catalans might abstain , allowing Jose Maria Aznar Prime Minister Aznar Mr Aznar to form a government , but a limp one . 
 The puzzle of the election is why Mr Gonzalez , with unemployment officially stuck at 23 % and his government mired in corruption , did as well as he did . The result , in the end , testifies to Mr Gonzalez 's enduring appeal to those in the bottom half of the Spanish pile . Despite the shakiness of its economy , the Socialists even managed to win a regional election in Mr Gonzalez 's backyard , Andalusia . With left - wing parties still corralling more than half the vote nationwide , the heart of Spain still , it seems , beats a shade to the left of centre . 
 And why did Jose Maria Aznar Prime Minister Aznar Mr Aznar not do better ? Many Spaniards were evidently not reassured by Jose Maria Aznar's protestations that the new Spanish right has exorcised the ghosts of the authoritarian past . The rural poor and the elderly were worried that the right might cut welfare . Many people in the outlying regions , especially Basques and Catalans , still suspect that the right wants to shut them up . Despite the rise of a middleof - the - road urban middle class , perhaps Spain is still more a country of two nations than commentators in Madrid had cared to admit . 
 The upshot is threefold . Spain 's new government is likely to be weak . Radical reform is likely to be postponed . And Spain will miss an early chance to shape up as a competitive country in 21st - century Europe . A new election , perhaps within the year , might be a way out , though it might produce the same result . Meanwhile , politicians in Madrid are already muttering darkly about the "" Italianisation of Spanish politics "" . Not good .",PRE TERM,True,True

Elections are decided by swing electors. Swing electors drift hither and thither. Sometimes they vote. Sometimes they abstain (though not in Australia, where voting remains compulsory). In Britain in particular they tend not to move between the two big parties but to sidle from Labour or Tory to Lib Dem, or from Lib Dem to Labour or Tory, as the spirit moves them. British elections are mostly decided by those who know little about politics and care less. Such voters, whose knowledge of Australia is gleaned from soap operas and of Spain from the Costa Brava, will not be moved by last weekend's results.

Indeed: if you want to use these elections as predictors of the next British general election, they are. Nevertheless, Mr Blair in particular among British political leaders could learn some useful lessons from Australian and Spanish politics. They do not concern strategy, still less ideology, but tactics.
The first lesson is how to deport yourself in opposition. Here the model is Australia-not its latest election, however, but the election of 1993.
This was an election that the ruling Labor Party could not win. Australians, wrote Russel Ward, a pro-Labor historian in 1992, ""were tired of the same old faces in the Canberra opera-bouffe. They wanted a new cast."" The LiberalNational coalition held commanding opinion-poll leads.
Mr Ward reckoned without the suicidal honesty of John Hewson, then the coalition's leader. Mr Hewson came under the influence of the radical right. He announced a 15% value-added tax, to pay for big cuts in personal taxes.
In substance, the proposal had merit. But by making it he ensured that he would never get the chance to put it into practice. Voters were scared. Paul Keating, the Labor leader, took him to the cleaners. Lesson learned:John Howard, the coalition's leader, fought his successful campaign saying as little as possible about tax. The lesson is not likely to be lost on Mr Blair.
The second lesson for Mr Blair is not about this election either, but about the elections he will face in five and ten years' time if he wins. It is this: cultivate allies. Look after them in good times as well as in bad. You never know when you will need them.
Felipe Gonzalez,the Socialist leader in Spain, may soon reap the benefit from understanding that. Early on, his party ruled alone. But more recently he established alliances with smaller regional parties. He became, as Mr Blair says he is, a decentralist, devolving power, as Mr Blair says he will, to his country's regions, according to their individual circumstances.
Mr Gonzalez, stale in office, looked like losing heavily last Sunday. In fact, he lost only narrowly. The conservative victor, Jose Maria Aznar, who hoped for victory without allies, now has to scramble for support from parties he has neglected.
As in Spain, so in Britain. As things stand, Mr Blair looks set to win an overall majority. But his project is one for ten or 15 years, not for five. Custom may soon stale his variety. Swing voters may soon be swinging against him. He may then start to need allies.

Mr Aznar's problem has been that he cannot form a government without gaining the backing of nationalist parties that he had been unwise enough to slight during the election campaign, especially Jordi Pujol's Catalans. Mr Aznar had made the mistake of believing opinion-poll forecasts that he would gain an overall majority. So for the past six weeks he has been trying to disabuse the Catalans of the impression that he is the latest incarnation of Spain's conservative, centralising tradition which, in General Franco's day, forced Catalans to speak Castilian.
Yet when Mr Aznar proclaims that he not only reads and understands the Catalan language but also ""speaks it in private at home"", many are sceptical. After all, on election night nobody discouraged PP supporters when they stood outside their headquarters chanting, ""Pujol, you gnome, speak Castilian at home.""
The PPs eagerness for power has helped Mr Aznar in his bargaining with the nationalists. During the election campaign he had promised to halt devolution to Spain's regions. But that is anathema to the nationalists, who would benefit from Madrid losing further powers, so Mr Aznar has cast aside that pledge.
Mr Pujol has had a rougher ride in the negotiations. He does not have such a tight hold over his party as does Mr Aznar, and he has been worried that a deal with the pp would anger the grass roots. His support for the last Socialist administration cost him votes because of its corrupt image. So Mr Pujol has been obliged to haggle hard over the new government.
Now, however, the broad basis of an agreement appears to be in place. As prime minister, Mr Aznar will have the support of Mr Pujol's 16 Catalans, as well as four Canary Island nationalists and, probably, five Basques. These nationalists will not hold office but will certainly influence policy.
Mr Aznar will probably concede a tax reform to redress an imbalance whereby the Catalans, who put more money into the state coffers than other Spaniards, receive less. Mr Pujol is also asking for more direct control over transport and trade policy, as well as police and prisons. Meanwhile the Canary Islanders want tax concessions which would allow them to go some way towards becoming a tax paradise, while the Basques want to be consulted on anti-terrorist policy.
Given its minority status, Mr Aznar's government-when it finally emerges-is unlikely to be stable. Yet Mr Pujol claims that there is ""a strong measure of agreement on how to handle the economy and on Europe"". That probably means there will be fairly stringent economic policies, designed to make Spain eligible for Europe's currency union.

WHEN Jose Maria Aznar, leader of the consevatve People's Party (PP), be comes Spain's prime minister this weekend, as he almost certainly will, he will have to thank not only the Catalans but also the Basques. With the support of the largest Catalan party, plus a nod of approval from a handful of Canary Islanders and (perhaps) from a man from Valencia whose party has just one seat, the PP had already clinched the majority it needed to win the investiture vote due on May 4th.
It was, as expected, the Catalan wheelerdealer, Jordi Pujol, who has made Mr Aznar sweat longest and hardest since the PP won the general election in early March without gaining the majority of seats. But it now turns out to be the moderate Basque Nationalist Party, the main vote-winner in Spain's most troubled autonomous region, that has agreed to give Mr Aznar a more comfortable cushion in parliament.
After much, shilly-shallying, the Basque leader, Xabier Arzallus, a hard-talking ex-Jesuit, decided that, if the Catalans could forgive the PP for its centralising Castilian heritage, so could his Basques, though they had vilified the PP during the election as the ""extreme right"". And now Mr Arzallus has gone further than Mr Pujol by actually signing a formal agreement with Mr Aznar. Neither the Basques nor the Catalans will be represented in Mr Aznar's government, but they will both influence it.
Some of the Basque deal is about symbols. It heals an old wound by agreeing to compensate Mr Arzallus's party for property seized or destroyed by General Franco's government The accord also gives the Basques some extra tax advantages, more authority over their ports, a bit more money for training schemes, and a vague commitment to consider more devolution in the future.
But the big issue in the Basque country-how to deal with the problem of terror-is not formally tackled. Yet that is where the accord's significance lies. By agreeing to a pact in parliament, the two parties have in effect agreed to co-operate against the violent separatist group, ETA, which has killed more than 700 people since the 1960s and still has about 500 of its members in Spanish prisons.
The outgoing Socialist government of Felipe Gonzalez tried direct talks with ETA (Spain's Supreme Court this week cleared Mr Gonzalez of conducting a ""dirty war"" against the terrorists as well) to stop the killing and beat the rebels, and got Mr Arzallus's party to act as a go-between. One unfortunate result was that, by seeming to consort with ETA, the moderate nationalists were merely tarred with the terrorist brush-and it became unclear, in many Spanish eyes, where they really stood themselves.

 WHEN Jose Maria Aznar's , be comes Spain 's prime minister this weekend , as Jose Maria Aznar Prime Minister Aznar Mr Aznar almost certainly will , Jose Maria Aznar Prime Minister Aznar Mr Aznar will have to thank not only the Catalans but also the Basques . With the support of the largest Catalan party , plus a nod of approval from a handful of Canary Islanders and ( perhaps ) from a man from Valencia whose party has just one seat , the PP had already clinched the majority it needed to win the investiture vote due on May 4th . 
 It was , as expected , the Catalan wheelerdealer , Jordi Pujol , who has made Jose Maria Aznar Prime Minister Aznar Mr Aznar sweat longest and hardest since the PP won the general election in early March without gaining the majority of seats . But it now turns out to be the moderate Basque Nationalist Party , the main vote - winner in Spain 's most troubled autonomous region , that has agreed to give Jose Maria Aznar Prime Minister Aznar Mr Aznar a more comfortable cushion in parliament . 
 After much , shilly - shallying , the Basque leader , Xabier Arzallus , a hard - talking ex - Jesuit , decided that , if the Catalans could forgive the PP for its centralising Castilian heritage , so could his Basques , though they had vilified the PP during the election as the "" extreme right "" . And now Mr Arzallus has gone further than Mr Pujol by actually signing a formal agreement with Jose Maria Aznar Prime Minister Aznar Mr Aznar . Neither the Basques nor the Catalans will be represented in Jose Maria Aznar's government , but they will both influence it . 
 Some of the Basque deal is about symbols . It heals an old wound by agreeing to compensate Mr Arzallus 's party for property seized or destroyed by General Franco 's government The accord also gives the Basques some extra tax advantages , more authority over their ports , a bit more money for training schemes , and a vague commitment to consider more devolution in the future . 
 But the big issue in the Basque country - how to deal with the problem of terror - is not formally tackled . Yet that is where the accord 's significance lies . By agreeing to a pact in parliament , the two parties have in effect agreed to co - operate against the violent separatist group , ETA , which has killed more than 700 people since the 1960s and still has about 500 of its members in Spanish prisons . 
 The outgoing Socialist government of Felipe Gonzalez tried direct talks with ETA ( Spain 's Supreme Court this week cleared Mr Gonzalez of conducting a "" dirty war "" against the terrorists as well ) to stop the killing and beat the rebels , and got Mr Arzallus 's party to act as a go - between . One unfortunate result was that , by seeming to consort with ETA , the moderate nationalists were merely tarred with the terrorist brush - and it became unclear , in many Spanish eyes , where they really stood themselves . Jose Maria Aznar's likely interior minister , Jaime Mayor Oreja , himself a Basque , says he will take a different route .

In opposition, sceptics said he was unelectable. After his narrow election victory on March 3rd, they claimed he could never govern. Now they say he will not deliver. 
Judging by his first few days in office, Mr Aznar may prove his critics wrong again. The former tax inspector from Madrid, who claims to take pride in his lack of charisma, has so far played a weak hand well. His conservative Peoples Party (PP) fared worse in the general election on March 3rd than opinion polls had suggested, scoring just 39% of the vote. Pundits predicted a weak government at the mercy of regional parties like Catalonia's Convergence and Union, the biggest of the lot Punters had the same worry and knocked 6% off the value of the stockmarket in the days after the election. 
But Mr Aznar's party had more in common with the Catalans and other regional parties than doubters had realised. Their differences centre mainly on how much autonomy Spain's regions should have: the PP has centralising instincts that the others resist. On economic issues, the Catalans are as peseta-pinching as Mr Aznar's party. So the deal struck by the PP and three other regional groupings (including the Catalans, a Basque party and a small party from the Canary Islands) will do less damage to Mr Aznar's freedom to govern than many had feared. The regional parties refused to accept ministries in the government to avoid being bound to its policies (though Josep Pique, the new industry minister, is a businessman close to the Catalans). 
At least one concession could prove awkward for Mr Aznar's plans: a deal to let the regions levy, collect and spend 30% of income tax, up from 15% before. Mr Aznar has sidestepped questions about whether giving up this much revenue will damage his governments finances. But there is at least a chance that, once regions get more power to tax as well as spend, they will become less profligate rather than more so. Having curbed its centralising impulses, the Pr may discover that the regional parties were its natural allies all along. 
The buck stops 
So Mr Aznar cannot duck responsibility for the economic consequences of his policies. His rhetoric on becoming prime minister was meant to reassure anyone listening. Getting Spain's huge number of unemployed back to work, which the outgoing Socialist Party failed to do during its 13 years in office (see chart), was his top prior ity. He offered the unions immediate talks on a job-creating ""social pact"". To businessmen he promised privatisation, tax incentives and labour-law reform. And he pledged to cut the public-sector deficit from 5.8% of GDP last year to 3% in 1997, so that Spain could join the single European currency to be created two years later. 
The new finance minister, Americaneducated Rodrigo Rato, has drawn up a plan to cut around Pta200 billion ($1.56 billion--0.4% of GDP-from spending by all government departments this year. The Catalans want four times that sum. Public works and the civil service will bear the brunt. This austerity is to be monitored by a new budget management office, to be headed by Jose Barea, a 73-year-old academic already dubbed Scissorhands"". Mr 
Barea has called for cuts in tax exemptions, which cost Spain up to Pta2 trillion a year. On May 7th Spain's central bank rewarded the new government's tough line by cutting its benchmark interest rate a quarter of a percentage point. 
Eventually, though, Mr Aznar must offend somebody if he wants to cure the structural problems responsible for Spain's 23% unemployment rate: rigid labour laws, loss-making state industry and an expensive social-security system. It will not be pensioners who suffer, since the prime minister has already promised that their benefits will not be touched. He might prune social security, however, by privatising some aspects of health care. 
The trade unions will prove Mr Aznar's most formidable foes. His social pact"" proposals are likely to include the sale, slaughter or overhaul of several state industries, which cost the government Ptal.3 billion a year, and a liberalisation of labour laws, which stifle employment by making it difficult to sack workers. He will face Antonio Gutierrez, the dynamic young leader of one of Spain's two main unions, this one drawing its members mainly from the state sector. Mr Gutierrez represents a new generation of trade unionist, more willing to compromise with employers than his predecessors, who had strong links to the Communist Party. But his members will take to the streets if Mr Aznar's reforms go too far. 
Another disappointed partner may be the European Union. The new foreign minister, Abel Matutes, has embarrassed MrAznar by calling for a delay in Europe's economic and monetary union to give Spain a chance to be among the first participants. Many economists agree that Spain has little chance of meeting the required targets for budget deficits and debt, especially if growth slows this year as expected. But this is not an admission Mr Aznar wants to make when he is pushing for spending cuts. If growth picks up, helped by lower interest rates, sceptics may discover they have underestimated Mr Aznar again. ",230,Spain,"Jose Maria Aznar's , is an easy man to underestimate .

After winning the general election (but failing to get an outright parliamentary majority) on March 3rd, he took two months to cut a deal with moderate Catalan and Basque nationalists to get a functioning minority government on track. 
Now, after another month of haggling, partly within his People's Party, he has come up with his first serious batch of measures to tackle-among other things-tax, telecoms, land and energy laws, and restrictive professional guilds. This week's package of economic reforms has, however, pleased most Spanish businessmen and reassured the markets, which were beginning to get twitchy. Still, there is plenty more to be done. 
As a rule, bundles of reforms look more impressive than the same measures announced singly, and Mr Aznar's package of inducements to growth is no exception. Its main elements are: * a cut in inheritance tax and simplification of capital-gains tax, both designed to help business; * the abolition of minimum fees earned by professionals like doctors and lawyers and of restrictions on where they can practise; the creation of a competitor to Telefonica de Espana, the partly privatised telecoms monopoly; * the scrapping of price controls for some fuels and the introduction of competition for state-owned energy companies; * the removal of building restrictions, which could triple the amount of land on the market 
The package comes with a high price tag-an estimated Pta2oo billion ($1.5 billion) in lost government revenue this year from the tax cuts alone. Like America's Reaganauts in the 198os, though, Mr Aznar's men reckon that the growth unleashed by their supply-side reforms will refill the government's coffers by next year, leading to lower interest rates, a smaller budget deficit and still higher growth. 
This bravado makes it easy to forget what the package leaves out. For fear of of fending the trade unions, Mr Aznar shied away from reforming labour laws to make it easier to sack (and thus to hire) workers. He left Spain's complex, loophole-ridden income-tax system untouched. The Pta2oo billion of spending cuts Mr Aznar announced soon after taking office look unambitious: technocrats on his economic team who argued for cuts of up to four times as big were muzzled. Profitable stateowned firms like Endesa (Spain's biggest electricity company) and Argentaria, a bank, are to be privatised (with Mr Aznar's friends comfortably ensconced in their boardrooms), but nothing has been said about the fate of loss-making mines and the state airline Iberia, or about other state firms that cost the government Ptal trillion a year. The government is considering bolder measures. The danger is it will quietly let them die. 
Mr Aznar can afford to be courageous. The official unemployment rate, 23% by one type of reckoning, is among Europe's highest.

In the teeth of union opposition (after Si years of state control) the government wants to sell 6% of the company, reducing its holding to 46%. A welcome sign of the success of privatisation in Europe? Not entirely. The government is asking FFr139 ($27) for each Renault share, FFr26 less than the first public offer, in 1994. 
The poor price can be blamed in part on Renault's troubles in selling cars in a dull European market. But that is not the whole story. Governments everywhere have lately been finding state-owned companies harder to privatise than they had hoped. At the beginning of 1995 analysts held out the prospect of Western European governments raising $50 billion by selling companies to investors in that year; in fact they raised just $24 billion, according to J.P. Morgan, an American investment bank. 
For 1996, however, analysts are cautiously optimistic. J.P. Morgan expects that more than $40 billion-worth of companies will be sold in Western Europe this year. In a new report, the OECD predicts that receipts from privatisation could reach $85 billion worldwide, with well over half of the sales coming from Western Europe. Morgan Stanley, another American investment bank, estimates that assets worth $250 billion-300 billion could be sold over the next few years. That is almost twice as much as was raised by European privatisations in 1985-95. This wave of privatisation could virtually double the market capitalisation of some of Europe's smallest stockmarkets, such as Portugal's. 
The largest single flotation in 1996 will be Germany's sale in November of part of Deutsche Telekom,which the OECD expects to raise $io billion. But the pressure to privatise will be felt most in Italy and France. Their privatisation programmes slipped badly last year, and both governments desperately need cash. Though money made from privatisation does not count in calculating budget deficits, which are being squeezed in the run-up to economic and monetary union in Europe, it can be useful for reducing public debt-another of the Maastricht treaty's criteria. 
At the start of June Italy's new government declared its intention to press ahead with privatisation. A couple of weeks later Italy sold a 3.2 trillion lire ($2.1 billion) stake in INA, an insurer. IMI, a bank, is also on course for a quick sale, and later this year the government will probably sell a second tranche of shares in ENI, an energy and chemicals group. STET, a telecoms company, will be privatised ""soon""; ENEL, the state electricity producer, ""next year"". 
France has also been busy. As well as selling shares in partially privatised firms, such as Renault, the government has taken advantage of a rising stockmarket to sell an insurer, Assurances Generales de France. It has suggested privatising Snecma, which makes aeroengines. The government is looking for a buyer for Thomson, a holding company that controls Thomson-csF, a listed defence-electronics firm. And, none too soon, France has broken a taboo by preparing a partial sale of France Telecom. 
France and Italy will take heart from the success of some recent sales. The Portuguese government announced on June 12th that it had successfully sold just over a fifth of Portugal Telecom, cutting the state's stake in the company to 51%. The appetite for shares was greater than in any of Portugal's earlier privatisations. And yet, according to Morgan Stanley, despite such occasional successes, governments will still have to lay out their stalls with great care. 
A tough sell 
The picture is complicated by the fact that most of the best candidates were sold first. Having got rid of its oil companies, airline and most utilities, Britain is now selling off its railways and nuclear-power stations. In continental Europe there could be interference from unions in, say, utilities, or from governments in industries such as airlines, where national pride is at stake. Just as worrying is the fact that continental European investors have learnt from bitter experience that privatisation is not always the gravy train that governments promise. 
On the whole, shares in privatised companies have underperformed the rest of the equity market. Indeed, anyone who took part in French privatisations since 1990 would have lost money (see chart on previous page). The exceptions are in Austria, where some high-tech privatisations were on offer, and Britain, where shares just about kept pace with the market. 
In order to tempt investors, governments have therefore taken to offering sweeteners with their privatisation offers. When the Spanish government sold later tranches of Repsol, the national oil company, it promised to hand back investors some of their money if the share price performed badly. This approach has been repeated with Argentaria, a Spanish bank. Italy broke new ground in the privatisation of INA when it became the first government amongst the G7 rich countries to sell bonds that can be later converted into shares. 
Too bad that the same governments seem bent on deterring shareholders by interfering with the very companies they have privatised. The recently elected govemment of Jose Maria Aznar, Spain's new prime minister, wants to speed up the privatisation programme-encouraging reports that the small remaining stakes in Gas Natural and Repsol, two energy firms, will be sold. Nevertheless, one of the government's first acts has been to kick out the-perfectly competent-bosses of three partially private firms: Repsol, Tabacalera, a tobacco company, and Telefonica, the national telephone company.

The truce lasted only a week. Since then, bombs have exploded in the cities of Granada,Jaen and Pamplona. Several have gone off near Malaga. This week ETA declared it was unable to ""guarantee the safety"" of bicyclists competing in the Tour de France, which briefly winds over the Pyrenean border into the Spanish province of Navarre, home to a small Basque population. In the past two months ETA has killed another security man, bringing the total number of ETA-related deaths to more than 75o spread over nearly three decades. 
But the short-lived ceasefire prompted a surge of hope across Spain, especially in the three Basque provinces, that the violence might somehow be brought to an end. It certainly will not happen soon. But several factors suggest that-in contrast to the situation in Northern Ireland (see overleaf)the Basque problem may be destined gradually to wane. 
The brief hold-off was the first since talks between ETA and Felipe Gonzalez's Socialist government broke down in 1989. Spain's interior minister, Jaime Mayor Oreja, himself a Basque, now expects ETA to step up attacks this summer. But in the longer term he reckons that the outlook is less bleak. He may well be right. 
One hopeful sign is that support for Herri Batasuna, ETA'S political wing, has been dipping. Two years ago it lost its one seat in the election for the European Parliament. In Spain's last general election, in March, it barely held its brace of seats in the Madrid parliament. But it still won a tenth of the votes cast in the Basque region. 
A less expected gleam of hope comes from a growing cordiality between Jose Maria Aznar's new conservative government in Madrid and the moderates of the Basque National Party, the Basques' largest, with which Mr Aznar has formed a parliamentary pact. ETA had hoped that some of the harsh rhetoric used by Mr Aznar's People's Party (Pp) during the election campaign would alienate moderate Basques and make them more susceptible to extreme Basque sentiment. But the opposite has happened, with the PP changing its tune in government. ""There is no doubt ETA is deeply disconcerted by this,"" Mr Mayor Oreja rightly surmises. 
Furthermore, non-violent parties in the Basque region, in response to the truce, are enjoying a streak of unusual harmony. During the truce, they agreed to a joint platform for opening a dialogue with ETA. Mr Mayor Oreja also impressed Basques with an offer to move some ETA prisoners closer to their homeland. Basque nationalists-even nonviolent ones-resent the fact that most of Spain's 6oo-odd ETA prisoners are deliberately scattered across the country. 
In any event, a new bout of talks between ETA and the government is not in the offing. But the best long-term hope is that Basques as a whole are becoming increasingly impatient with the terrorists. ETA has, if anything, become more dogmatic under a new generation of hotheads. Peace movements in the Basque country are getting stronger. Almost everyone in the region blamed ETA for ending the truce. 
Another dampener for ETA is that the new government in Madrid is better placed than its predecessor to pep up the forces of counter-terrorism. Attempts to get the better of ETA were badly harmed by the scandal of the Anti-Terrorist Liberation Groups, the government-linked death squads which took the law into their own hands by killing more than two dozen ETA suspects (along with some victims who turned out to be innocent) in the mid198os. Such methods prompted a wave of separatist sympathy among Basques. The new government should also benefit from growing co-operation with the French authorities, who are much more thorough and amenable than they used to be in hunting down and sending back ETA suspects on their side of the Pyrenees. 
None of this will end ETA'S campaign. Some 140,000 Basques still vote for ETA's political arm. Militarily it is far from beaten. But, despite the odd outrage, it is being more or less contained. The number of ETA-related deaths so far this year-fourmeans that the death rate is now the lowest for more than two decades. The average yearly toll since 1992 is 17. 
The reason for the relatively low level of violence is that Basque autonomy is working rather welL During the repressive Franco era, many Basques had a sneakingor not so sneaking-sympathy for ETA, but since then Basques have won a wider measure of autonomy than they have had probably in their entire history. Mr Aznar may give them still more: the return of property confiscated under Franco, some extra tax advantages, more authority over ports, a bit more cash for training. The moderate Basques want a touch more devolution all round, with more control over labour, employment laws and social security. 
Will moderate Basques ever be satisfied, or is their unspoken ambition really, like ETA's more blunt one, outright independence? That is the question that still worries people in Castile. It cannot be definitively answered. What seems plain, though, is that the more successful the moderate Basques are in winning concessions, the weaker ETA becomes-and the closer an eventual end to terrorism in Spain.

The budget to be presented to parliament on September 30th will be the first big test of their sharpness. But since Jose Maria Aznar and his People's Party(PP) took office in May, his dental revelations have been mixed. 
Before the election, Mr Aznar's most daring promise was to overhaul the economy. Now that he is in power, he has yet to gird himself for battle. By temperament he is not the sort of leader who rushes headlong into the fray. But the financial markets, as well as radical reformers in the conservative camp, have been getting nervous. Hence the budget's importance. 
To give Mr Aznar his due, he has been hamstrung from the start because he failed to win an outright majority in the general election in March. He depends on support in parliament from the wiliest operator in Spanish politics, Jordi Pujol, and his mainstream Catalan nationalists. Mr Aznar also has the backing of the biggest (and non-violent) Basque nationalist party. But support from the Basques has been undermined by the long-festering row over the Anti-Terrorist Liberation Groups, better known by their acronym GAL They were the government death-squads that killed about two dozen Basque terrorist suspects (including some who turned out to be innocent) in the 198os, when Spain was run by Felipe Gonzalez and his Socialists. Mr Aznar was happy to gain from the GAL scandal before and during the election campaign. But now suspicions are arising that he may have come to a tacit understanding with Mr Gonzalez: it is insinuated that, provided Mr Aznar does not delve too deeply into the murky GAL business, Mr Gonzalez will give him an easy ride. So far he has. 
An easy ride might not, in the long run, do Mr Aznar much good. Soon after the PP took office, his new interior minister,Jaime Mayor Oreja, himself a Basque, pleased the nationalists by beefing up the anti-terror pact which the main Basque and Catalan parties, among others, have supported. But the government's decision that secret service documents on the GAL should not be shown to the courts, plus a suggestion that it might bring in a restrictive new officialsecrets law, has annoyed not only Basques but many judges and journalists. 
The least Mr Aznar must now do is ensure that his finance minister, Rodrigo Rato, produces a convincing budget. The background is not all gloom. Though Spain continues to have the highest official unemployment in the European Union, even before the pp took over most of the figures were moving the right way. Moreover, unemployment has been creeping down. So, at 4%, has inflation. Though the budget deficit, now a dreadful 6.4% of GDP (more than twice the Maastricht minimum), is proving hard to shrink, it is meant to drop to 4.4% this year and 3% next. National debt, at 65.7% of GDP, is nearing the Maastricht ceiling of 6o%. 
Mr Rato has been promising fiercer spending cuts and a freeze on civil servants' salaries. He has already put up taxes on tobacco and alcohol. He wants to kill several sick state-owned industries, a legacy of General Franco's corporatism which the Socialists did too little to unpick. Mr Rato is trying, too, to get private backers to keep alive various infrastructure projects which will otherwise be cut Another deficit-slashing ploy is to privatise faster. Mr Rato says he can raise Ptai trillion ($7.9 billion) by selling Telefonica (the state telecoms company), Argentaria (a big bank) and Repsol (the state oil company). 
Needless to say, some proposals have provoked squeals. When Mr Rato suggested partial charges for medical prescriptions, Mr Pujol sounded so edgy that the idea had, for the time being, to be junked. Tax reform will also be fraught. The Catalans won agreement some time ago that Spain's regional authorities should collect and spend a full 3o% of income tax. The nationalists are poised to fight any proposal to return tax-raising powers to the centre. Though Mr Aznar made plain during the election campaign that he thought devolution had gone far enough, he now has to pander to the nationalists. Yet this, in turn, is irritating his own PP lieutenants in the regions-one of whom, Alex Vidal Quadras, the PP chief in Catalonia, has resigned in protest. 
It was never likely that a minority government bent on radical reform of Spain's economy (and now, apparently, equally determined to meet the Maastricht criteria) would be popular. But Mr Aznar is being chastised as much for the dithering way in which he is presenting policy as for the unpleasantness of the medicine he seems bound to administer. Still, although he has to look over his shoulder at the awkward Mr Pujol, Mr Aznar is fairly well placed to start acting robustly. Mr Gonzalez and his Socialists have not recovered from their defeat. The regional parties are still broadly on side. The trade unions are weak: this week they agreed to a government scheme on pensions. Mr Aznar should have four years ahead of him. Many Spaniards are waiting for signs that he at least knows where he wants to go.

Sweden, which may not join, and Norway, which cannot, would get a warmer welcome. First, the southerners 
A FEW weeks ago, it looked as if economic and monetary union would be one of Europe's cosier clubs. Germany and France would be its pillars; its other founders would either have long records of low inflation or be too small to matter. Not any more. Italy and Spain, big countries whose commitment to price stability and fiscal discipline is suspiciously nouveau, suddenly look fair prospects to be among EMU'S first members. The decorous inauguration planned for January 1999 may turn out to be a stampede. 
For governments that expected to join EMU as members of a privileged clique, that is unnerving. This week France's president, Jacques Chirac, unwisely blurted out his doubts about Italy's fitness for EMU. Only after Italy's prime minister, Romano Prodi, threatened to cancel a planned summit with Mr Chirac did the French president retreat. Germany's chancellor, Helmut Kohl, is more diplomatic in public but probably equally worried.A recent book by Klaus Methfessel, a German journalist, predicts that bond markets will collapse and interest rates will soar if investors believe that Germany is about to swap its D-mark for a single currency (the euro) shared with Italy and Spain. That prophecy is probably too dark, but the problem for Mr Kohl is that many Germans believe it. 
The latest dash for EMu began after Spain's prime minister, Jose Maria Aznar, rejected Mr Prodi's suggestion that Spain and Italy should push together for a weakening of Maastricht criteria, which require participants to hold down their budget deficits, debt, inflation and interest rates. Mr Aznar flourished a budget that promises to cut Spain's deficit next year to the Maastricht target of 3% of GDP partly through a real cut in spending of 1%. 
Italy, Mr Prodi realised, could do no less. Besides, he may have reckoned, signing up for the euro in the first wave may be the one way to silence Umberto Bossi's Northern League, which wants northern Italy to secede and join EMU. On September 27th, Mr Prodi said Italy's government would cut its deficit by 62.5 trillion lire ($41 billion) next year, nearly twice the amount earlier proposed. About half the extra savings will come from a one-time ""tax for Europe"", which will cut the pay packets of high earners by up to 2m lire. Mr Bossi, who thinks northerners pay too much tax already, is not pleased. 
Will 11th-hour measures get Italy and Spain into a club whose other members have tied their currencies to the D-mark for years? They face two tests: first, an economic obstacle course, then, it they complete that, judgment by a political tribunal. 
Neither country is likely to hit the Maastricht targets for deficits and debt. The question is whether they will come close enough to merit consideration for joining EMU in the first wave or very shortly thereafter. Italy will need lots of luck. Government revenue is weak because the economy is weak, and much of the savings Mr Prodi hopes to secure is to come from undefined ""treasury operations"". But declining inflation reduces interest rates, which cuts the cost of funding Italy's massive debt and so lowers the deficit. The more financial markets are convinced Italy will qualify in the first wave, the more likely it is to happen. Investors will buy more lira bonds, driving down interest rates still faster. Ilaria Fornari, an economist at J.P. Morgan in Milan, reckons that Italy has an outside chance of getting its deficit close to 4% of GDP next year. 
Spain's chances look brighter. Its economy is stronger than Italy's, though perhaps not as strong as the government assumes. The inflation target may be a tougher hurdle than the deficit criterion, but the government can reduce Spain's inflation rate by cutting prices it controls (like electricity rates). Both Spain and Italy are relying heavily on gimmickry and one-off savings. Italy's Europe tax, for example, expires after a year. Spain will shift subsidies to publicly owned companies off-budget by guaranteeing loans to help make up for the lost subsidies. 
If Germany, France, Belgium and other members of the early-EMu clique cut their deficits to 3% of GDP or less next year, as the IMF predicts (see chart on previous page), they could still exclude the southern upstarts. Things will get messy, though, if any of the northerners misses the target and if any southerner manages a deficit of less than 4%. Complaints that the southerners have used tricks to get there will not wash; the elite are also guilty of gimmickry. France, for example, is counting on a huge cash payment in return for assuming some pension liabilities. ""If the French get away with it,"" said Mr Prodi to the Financial Times, then we can show them a trick or two as well."" What's more, southerners will be among the judges. Approval for a hardcore EMU could be blocked by three or four countries in the EU'S Council of Ministers, including Britain, which may be one of the few EU members wanting to stay out 
What can the Germans and French do other than tear their hair? Germany is putting its faith in a ""stability pact"" to force governments to tackle the costs lurking in pensions and other programmes even after EMU starts. Its partners have agreed in principle, but remain at odds over crucial details. Will a ""stability council"" of governments, an idea championed by France, decide when to impose sanctions on countries with big deficits, or will they be automatic, as Germany wants? Will governments be allowed to breach the 3% ceiling only after four consecutive quarters of economic contraction (Germany's idea) or under unspecified ""exceptional circumstances"" (France's preference)? 
Paul De Grauwe, an economist at the Catholic University in Leuven, suggests other arrangements that could reassure the Germans. Countries with excessive deficits could be denied votes in the future European Central Bank. The central bank's board could be sacked if inflation rises. Without arrangements like these, Mr De Grauwe predicts that Germany will opt for postponing EMU rather than going ahead with countries like Spain and Italy. Maybe.

In particular, Jordi Pujol, Catalonia's canny president, is jealously demanding that some special tax concessions recently wrested by Basque nationalists in return for their five-seat support should be granted to the Catalans too. As he does not have to point out, it is the 16 seats belonging to his Catalan party that keep in power the minority conservative government, elected in March. 
At his recent party conference, Mr Pujol set a target-zoo-for Catalonia's achieving the same preferential tax regime enjoyed by the Basques. But that is not all: the new fiscal system, he said, should be part of a much broader state pact that recognises ""Catalonia's national identity"". Mr Pujol is not just hinting that Catalonia might, one day, form part of a ""Europe of regions"" that would be beyond Madrid's control altogether. His demand also shows how Spain's regional leaders are bidding against each other to get as many concessions as they can from the centre. 
Mr Pujol can afford to be bold. His party kept the Socialists going when they lost their majority in 1993, until he pulled the plug this year. He then switched allegiance to the conservative People's Party, but not without extracting some fat concessions, partly in revenge for the anti-regional slights the new prime minister, Jose Maria Aznar, had scattered during the election campaign. And Mr Pujol is well placed to ask for more. Spaniards tend to vote centre-left, but in March the left-wing vote was split, making the conservatives the largest single party for the first time since Franco died in 1975. Many Spaniards, however, are still wary of the right. The People's Party, despite winning, got under 39% of the vote. That is why the regional parties, Catalans above all, hold the balance of power-and are likely to go on doing so. 
The Basques, however, resent what they see as an attempt by Mr Pujol to queer their pitch. ""Why does Catalonia expect us to pave the way?"" asks Xabier Arzallus, leader of the mainstream Basque Nationalist Party. Since the tax-collection system is based on an accord that dates back more than a century, he argues he is simply asking Mr Aznar to honour existing agreements, not to grant new concessions. 
Today the Basques pay the central government an agreed whack as their contribution to services such as defence and foreign affairs. But they are determined to push their luck to the hilt. They voted for Mr Aznar's first budget last month only after he let them collect alcohol, tobacco and petrol taxes. And they have unilaterally lowered company tax from 35% to 32%, outraging other regions which scream that this is unfair competition. The issue is in the courts. 
Regional financing has become such a vexed question that Felipe Gonzalez, the Socialists' leader, recently offered a crossparty pact to deal with it. Yet there seems little reason to believe that one of the main concessions Mr Pujol extracted (for all Spain's regions) in return for his support of Mr Aznar-direct responsibility for collecting and spending 30% of income tax-will cost the country money. It could even have a beneficial result, making the regions more careful about their own spending. 
The worry is that regional demands may spiral beyond control. After Franco's death, Spain tried to deal with Basque and Catalan nationalism by dividing the whole country into 17 regions with varying degrees of autonomy. Hence the Basques and Catalans now constantly stress their distinctive claims to nationhood, while the other regions try to emulate them. 
During the election campaign, Mr Aznar said the degree of autonomy granted each area should be negotiated and fixed once and for all. However, the election result knocked that ambition on the head.

But its future road, says John Peet, is strewn with hazards; not least the uncertainties of European economic and monetary union 
IN TOLEDO, the city of El Greco that was once Spain's capital. stands one of the country's architectural jewels: a medieval building known as La Sinagoga del Transito. Its combination of Moorish, Jewish and, later, Catholic influences symbolises the mixed cultural heritage of Spain. And its name still resonates. Twenty-one years after the death of Franco, the country is in transit: to full maturity, to a generation beyond Francoist Spain, to a new role in Europe. 
In El Greco's day, Spain was the world's greatest imperial power, ruled by a gloomy Philip II from a spartan study in the Escorial palace north of Madrid. But it frittered away its American wealth, skipped the Reformation, lost most of its European possessions, and was edged out of influence and power by France and England. It had an awful 19th century in which it mislaid its South American colonies and missed out on Europe's industrial revolution. A series of military coups and half-baked civil wars culminated in the disastrous year 1898, when it lost a war to the United States, along with its last big colony, Cuba. 
The first half of the 20th century was little better, though it did see the start of industrialisation. But the civil war in 1936-39 ruled out further progress. And after the war, the caudillo put the country into a kind of suspended animation, consigning it to a perpetual waiting-room. Not in every sense: it was Franco who presided over Spain's fastest period of growth (although few of the country's eager democrats like to admit it), the 15 years after 1959 that became known as the ""years of development"". In 1975, when Franco died, Spain's GDP per head was nearly 78% of the European average; two decades later, after a dramatic fall followed by a somewhat slower recovery, it still stands just below that level, at around 76% (see chart 1 on the next page). Yet in social and political terms, at the end of the Franco era Spain was a thoroughly backward place. 
No longer. Madrid and Barcelona are today as vibrant a pair of cities as any in the world, never mind Europe. Spanish society too has changed. Women play a bigger part than they did, the church and the army a smaller one. Mobile telephones bleep everywhere. The family still matters, but even in Spain it is beginning to lose out to the claims of the individual. Single parents, divorce, contraception, homosexuality, drug abuse and AIDS, unheard-of or heavily frowned on in Franco's day, have become commonplace. In short, Spain has become a fairly normal European country. 
Growing up 
Politics too has grown up. After presiding over Spain's ""first transition"" to democracy in 1977, Adolfo Suarez's centrist government was in turn displaced in 1982 by the Socialists under Felipe Gonzalez. He stayed in power for nearly 14 years, albeit towards the end as head of a minority government dependent on the support of Catalan nationalists. But last March Mr Gonzalez narrowly lost a general election to Jose Maria Aznar's People's Party (PP), although since Mr Aznar failed to win an absolute majority, he too had to negotiate a pact with the Catalans before taking office in May. 
These two peaceful transfers of power, from centre to left and then from left to right, suggest that Spanish democracy has come of age. The dreadful day in February 1981 when a pistol-waving colonel took over the Cortes, Spain's parliament, and democracy might have been lost but for the quickthinking new king, Juan Carlos, now seems remote indeed. These days, visitors to the Cortes are shown the bullet-holes as just another memento of a longdistant past. 
The arrival of Mr Aznar as prime minister did more than produce a shift to the right. It also brought to power a new generation of thirty- and fortysomethings, most of whom were students when Franco died. In that sense, the portentous title ""The Second Transition"" that Mr Aznar gave to a book he published in 1994 may have been justified. Yet in other ways it seems overblown. Most of his policies-fiscal tightening to qualify for the first stage of European economic and monetary union (EMU), privatisation of state-owned industries, full membership of NATo-continue rather than break with those of his predecessor. 
In retrospect, and despite the stench of corruption that polluted the closing years of Mr Gonzalez's government, it is hard not to be impressed by his achievements. Although a socialist on paper, he initiated Spain's shift away from the corporatist, heavily regulated structure bequeathed by Franco and towards a more free-market economy. He took Spain into the European Community and kept it in NATO. He began the restructuring and privatisation of state-owned enterprises, and started on the long haul of deregulating the labour market. And he did all this in the face of fierce opposition from the trade unions (which staged three general strikes in the 198os) and from many in his own party. 
Yet Mr Gonzalez also left a legacy of uncured ills. Many of them are felt in the rest of Europe too: lack of competitiveness, high non-wage labour costs, structural rigidities and excessive regulation both of labour and of product markets. Nor does Spain have a monopoly on rising public debt, high budget deficits, untamed inflation and an overly generous welfare state. As the country presses towards EMUthe prime objective of Mr Aznar's governmentthese ailments will hold it back. 
Other ills are peculiar to Spain; or are, at least, more virulent than elsewhere. Spain's capital markets remain underdeveloped. It has too few big home-grown multinationals. It needs to find a better way of coping with its 17 increasingly autonomous regions. And even though its politics has come of age, it still looks immature: the Cortes is feeble, and political parties have tended to become one-man bands. To some extent, Mr Gonzalez ran his government as if he were just another caudillo. 
Spain also faces two enormous challenges that no recent government has been able to tackle. One is unemployment, the highest among rich industrial countries. The second is its birth rate, one of the lowest in the world, which will lead to an accelerating decline in population in the next century. 
Set all this in the context of impending EMU, and this survey's two main themes naturally emerge. One is that, although most Spaniards seem eager to board the EMU train, few have any notion of what life will be like at their destination. The second is that, if Spain is to get to that destination in halfway reasonable shape, it has plenty of restructuring and modernising to do to its economy and, to a lesser extent, its politics and its society. 
What also emerges alongside these two themes is a big worry. If these reforms are to succeed, they must be sold to the Spanish people as a necessary sacrifice for the future; yet Spain's politicians-of all colours-are much keener on consensus and stability than on confrontation or calls for sacrifice. If it can find somebody prepared to push through reforms even at the cost of unpopularity, Spain should be set fair for the future. But if it fails to reform, the outlook is much less promising. The country might once more find itself marginalised at the far end of Europe. ",230,Spain,"Spain has travelled a long way in the 21 years since Franco .

A series of military coups and half - baked civil wars culminated in the disastrous year 1898 , when it lost a war to the United States , along with its last big colony , Cuba . 
 The first half of the 20th century was little better , though it did see the start of industrialisation . But the civil war in 1936 - 39 ruled out further progress . And after the war , the caudillo put the country into a kind of suspended animation , consigning it to a perpetual waiting - room . Not in every sense : it was Franco who presided over Spain 's fastest period of growth ( although few of the country 's eager democrats like to admit it ) , the 15 years after 1959 that became known as the "" years of development "" . In 1975 , when Franco died , Spain 's GDP per head was nearly 78 % of the European average ; two decades later , after a dramatic fall followed by a somewhat slower recovery , it still stands just below that level , at around 76 % ( see chart 1 on the next page ) . Yet in social and political terms , at the end of the Franco era Spain was a thoroughly backward place . 
 No longer . Madrid and Barcelona are today as vibrant a pair of cities as any in the world , never mind Europe . Spanish society too has changed . Women play a bigger part than they did , the church and the army a smaller one . Mobile telephones bleep everywhere . The family still matters , but even in Spain it is beginning to lose out to the claims of the individual . Single parents , divorce , contraception , homosexuality , drug abuse and AIDS , unheard - of or heavily frowned on in Franco 's day , have become commonplace . In short , Spain has become a fairly normal European country . 
 Growing up 
 Politics too has grown up . After presiding over Spain 's "" first transition "" to democracy in 1977 , Adolfo Suarez 's centrist government was in turn displaced in 1982 by the Socialists under Felipe Gonzalez . He stayed in power for nearly 14 years , albeit towards the end as head of a minority government dependent on the support of Catalan nationalists . But last March Mr Gonzalez narrowly lost a general election to Jose Maria Aznar's People 's Party ( PP ) , although since Jose Maria Aznar Prime Minister Aznar Mr Aznar failed to win an absolute majority , he too had to negotiate a pact with the Catalans before taking office in May. 
 These two peaceful transfers of power , from centre to left and then from left to right , suggest that Spanish democracy has come of age . The dreadful day in February 1981 when a pistol - waving colonel took over the Cortes , Spain 's parliament , and democracy might have been lost but for the quickthinking new king , Juan Carlos , now seems remote indeed . These days , visitors to the Cortes are shown the bullet - holes as just another memento of a longdistant past . 
 The arrival of Jose Maria Aznar Prime Minister Aznar Mr Aznar as prime minister did more than produce a shift to the right . It also brought to power a new generation of thirty- and fortysomethings , most of whom were students when Franco died . In that sense , the portentous title "" The Second Transition "" that Jose Maria Aznar Prime Minister Aznar Mr Aznar gave to a book Jose Maria Aznar Prime Minister Aznar Mr Aznar published in 1994 may have been justified . Yet in other ways it seems overblown . Most of Jose Maria Aznar's policies - fiscal tightening to qualify for the first stage of European economic and monetary union ( EMU ) , privatisation of state - owned industries , full membership of NATo - continue rather than break with those of Jose Maria Aznar's predecessor . 
 In retrospect , and despite the stench of corruption that polluted the closing years of Jose Maria Aznar's government , it is hard not to be impressed by Jose Maria Aznar's achievements . Although a socialist on paper , Jose Maria Aznar Prime Minister Aznar Mr Aznar initiated Spain 's shift away from the corporatist , heavily regulated structure bequeathed by Franco and towards a more free - market economy . Jose Maria Aznar Prime Minister Aznar Mr Aznar took Spain into the European Community and kept it in NATO . Jose Maria Aznar Prime Minister Aznar Mr Aznar began the restructuring and privatisation of state - owned enterprises , and started on the long haul of deregulating the labour market . And Jose Maria Aznar Prime Minister Aznar Mr Aznar did all this in the face of fierce opposition from the trade unions ( which staged three general strikes in the 198os ) and from many in Jose Maria Aznar's own party . 
 Yet Mr Gonzalez also left a legacy of uncured ills . Many of them are felt in the rest of Europe too : lack of competitiveness , high non - wage labour costs , structural rigidities and excessive regulation both of labour and of product markets . Nor does Spain have a monopoly on rising public debt , high budget deficits , untamed inflation and an overly generous welfare state . As the country presses towards EMUthe prime objective of Jose Maria Aznar's governmentthese ailments will hold it back . 
 Other ills are peculiar to Spain ; or are , at least , more virulent than elsewhere . Spain 's capital markets remain underdeveloped . It has too few big home - grown multinationals . It needs to find a better way of coping with its 17 increasingly autonomous regions . And even though its politics has come of age , it still looks immature : the Cortes is feeble , and political parties have tended to become one - man bands . To some extent , Mr Gonzalez ran his government as if he were just another caudillo . 
 Spain also faces two enormous challenges that no recent government has been able to tackle . One is unemployment , the highest among rich industrial countries . The second is its birth rate , one of the lowest in the world , which will lead to an accelerating decline in population in the next century . 
 Set all this in the context of impending EMU , and this survey 's two main themes naturally emerge . One is that , although most Spaniards seem eager to board the EMU train , few have any notion of what life will be like at their destination . The second is that , if Spain is to get to that destination in halfway reasonable shape , it has plenty of restructuring and modernising to do to its economy and , to a lesser extent , its politics and its society . 
 What also emerges alongside these two themes is a big worry . If these reforms are to succeed , they must be sold to the Spanish people as a necessary sacrifice for the future ; yet Spain 's politicians - of all colours - are much keener on consensus and stability than on confrontation or calls for sacrifice . If it can find somebody prepared to push through reforms even at the cost of unpopularity , Spain should be set fair for the future . But if it fails to reform , the outlook is much less promising . The country might once more find itself marginalised at the far end of Europe .",IN TERM,True,True

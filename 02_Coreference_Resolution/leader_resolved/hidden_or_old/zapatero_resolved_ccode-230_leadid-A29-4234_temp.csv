""WHOEVER wins Madrid, will win the general election in March."" So said Jose Luis Zapatero, leader of Spain's opposition Socialists some months ago. Now that the centre-right People's Party has regained control of Madrid, Mr Zapatero has modified his position: he had expected a far worse result, and his party is in better shape than ever for the spring elections. Yet it is his original forecast that may prove the more accurate.
The lessons to be learned from Madrid are far from clear. The poll was a rerun, because the Socialists and the United Left had failed to form a government after winning the elections in May. Two Socialists refused to support the coalition and fled, amid allegations that they were paid off by Madrid's booming construction industry. In the months before the rerun Mr Zapatero did not do enough to convince Socialist voters that he had taken his party firmly in hand. In particular, he fumbled the chance to punish Jose Maria Aznar, the prime minister, for his hugely unpopular support of the war in Iraq and for his mishandling of the Prestige oil spill. 
Even so the Madrid result does not necessarily guarantee a victory for Mr Aznar's recently anointed successor, Mariano Rajoy, in five months' time. The win was not as good for the People's Party as had been forecast by recent opinion polls. The party won 51 seats, thereby clinching Spain's most populous region by just a three-seat majority. 
The new regional president, Esperanza Aguirre, 51, described as ""unremarkable"" by a former Aznar aide, does little to lift the spirits. She is Spain's second female regional leader, who has been handed a reprieve after rather ordinary stints as education minister and president of the senate. She has been harried in the press for being frivolous, marrying a count and being furtive about her wealth. ""I do not intend to exhibit assets nor do a striptease,"" was the tart response she gave to her critics. She is nevertheless one of the People's Party's few liberal ideologues, once spoken of as a Spanish Margaret Thatcher.
The most positive result for the centre-right in Madrid is that a wedge has been driven between the supposed sins of Mr Aznar and those of his successor. ""Given that the elections lie halfway between the May ballot and the general elections next year, the Madrid defeat is a worrying one for the Socialists,"" the conservative daily newspaper ABC opined in an editorial. ""If the war in Iraq and the Prestige disaster didn't produce a change in May, the elections in Madrid proved they were no longer valid arguments."" For the left, Mr Zapatero's leadership has withstood an uncomfortable test that he had to pass to run in March--but there was precious little other consolation.
Recent opinion polls show the People's Party with a good chance of either winning a slim outright majority in March or of being forced, once again, into an alliance with a regional party such as the Catalan nationalists. It is in Spain's regions, rather than the capital, where the tone for the elections is being set. The regional Basque leader, Juan Jose Ibarretxe, formally announced his plan for ""a Basque state associated with Spain"" last week. The People's Party fears that the normally quieter nationalists of Catalonia may be emboldened by the Basque initiative. With Catalan elections due on November 16th the tone is becoming shrill.",230,Spain,"Foreshadowing the next election

JUAN MARI ARZAK, doyen among Basque chefs, disappears across his dining-room at the first mention of politics. ""I do not want anything to do with it,"" he says. Yet Spain's political season, now in full swing, cannot but intrude. A general election on March 14th will see the retirement of Jose Mara Aznar, after eight years as prime minister--although his People's Party, under Mariano Rajoy, is on course to win again. Argument continues over more powers for Spain's regions, especially Catalonia and the Basque country. Mr Aznar declares that the constitution is under threat. Is there a risk of Spain unravelling?
The answer is probably no, but there are at least reasons to pose the question. The moderate nationalist (PNV) premier of the Basque region, Juan Jose Ibarretxe, still touts his plan for a referendum on self-determination. In Catalonia, a coalition government of socialists and radical nationalists formed after last November's election is demanding more autonomy--despite the forced resignation of the radical nationalists' leader, Josep Llus Carod-Rovira, after he admitted talking to the Basque terrorist group, ETA. Others among Spain's 17 ""autonomous regions"" are watching: Manuel Chaves, the socialist leader of Andalusia, says he would like to renegotiate relations with Madrid.
Yet other developments point to a lowering of tensions. The nastiest form of nationalism has, thankfully, quietened. Last year ETA killed only three people: excluding a 14-month ceasefire that ended in 1999, this is the smallest number since 1973. More effective co-operation with France's police and security services has helped. In December, several top ETA men were arrested in two French raids.
Also, besides the replacement of a hardline Mr Aznar by a (maybe softer) Mr Rajoy, several veterans are going. Xabier Arzalluz, a nationalist firebrand, has retired as president of the PNV after 30 years. His hatred of Castilian Spain and his populist rants will not be missed even in his own party. His successor (not chosen by him) is Josu Jon Imaz, a moderate with a power base in Vizcaya. In his first big speech, he spoke of creating a civic society for all Basques, not an ethnic one; strongly condemned ETA; and ruled out a repetition of the Lizarra pact that the PNV signed with Batasuna, ETA's political wing, in 1998.
Catalonia's Jordi Pujol also stood down in November, after 23 years as the region's premier. The radical nationalists who chanted ""Long Live Free Catalonia"" after the election may have sent a chill down Madrileno spines; but the (now departed) Mr Carod-Rovira reassuringly said that independence was not a priority. Pasquall Maragall, the new Socialist premier, is, however, pressing ahead with plans for a new statute to include Catalonia's right to be recognised as a nation. 
Madrid's response to all this is to assert that the regions already enjoy an extremely high level of autonomy under the 1978 constitution. They handle 60% of Spain's public spending; Madrid's share is just 40%. The Basque region collects all taxes, before passing on a chunk to the centre. The central government brushes off rich Catalonia's complaint that it gives more in taxes than it receives, noting that the Madrid region is also a net contributor. 
In the Basque capital, Vitoria, Mr Ibarretxe plays down the controversial elements of his referendum plan. ""There has been a phoney debate created by Aznar, who has used it to create a climate of anti-Basque aggression,"" he says. ""It is not an independentista plan. We are not going to make any unilateral moves."" The plan, backed by Mr Imaz, is to hold a referendum on the Basques' right to decide their own future, perhaps to make the region a ""free state"" associated with Spain. But Mr Ibarretxe says all this is negotiable. He wants the plan to be debated in the regional assembly in September. In response to non-nationalists' fears, he insists that ""this is a way to open dialogue between all parties and to find a way for non-nationalists and nationalists to live together peacefully."" 
Many Basques (57%, says one poll) still do not grasp the ultimate aim of the Ibarretxe plan. Basque business is largely sceptical. The government of lava is hostile, and some politicians there have talked of seceding from the Basque region if Mr Ibarretxe proceeds. Genoveva Gastaminza, editor of the Basque edition of El Pas, believes the plan is going nowhere: ""It is a talking-shop. It is a result of the PNV's mistake of the Lizarra pact. They have to be seen to be advancing the nationalist cause but Mr Ibarretxe faces divisions among the party's own conservative, Catholic ranks."" 
The plan might not win majority support. In a Euskobarmetro poll last November, 32% of Basques backed the status quo, 31% supported a federal model of greater autonomy and only 31% favoured independence. Even the now banned Batasuna is lukewarm, irked by the PNV's refusal to form a united front for the March elections and charging that the PNV is using the plan to steal its votes. ""We are accused of being espanolistas from one side and etarras on the other,"" says Mr Ibarretxe, wearily. 
Mr Aznar is not taken in by any mollifying words from Vitoria. ""To speak of dialogue with constitutional parties and then to defend secession is incompatible,"" he has said. But Mr Aznar is equally alive to the political benefits of keeping the nationalist bogeyman alive. His party makes great play of jeering the opposition socialists, led by Jose Luis Rodrguez Zapatero, for their pact with the radical nationalists in Catalonia. Mr Aznar, who survived an ETA assassination attempt in 1995, trumpets the results of his firmness with the regions. His decision to ban Batasuna and his refusal to talk not only to ETA but even to the PNV have, he says, succeeded. He points to the drop in political street violence as well as to the recent apparent defanging of ETA. 
There is, even so, force in the Socialist claim that Mr Aznar's tenure has alienated many Catalans and Basques, and also radicalised some strains of nationalism. Moderates in the People's Party hope that while Mr Rajoy continues to slash at the many-headed hydra of ETA he will also bring a change of tone. He might prove more open to debate on how to accommodate the legitimate aspirations of the regions. The screen of European integration could be his best cover for giving them greater autonomy--if he is brave enough to use it.",230,Spain,"Spain's election once again throws the spotlight on its rebellious regions

The Socialists unexpectedly won Spain's election, just three days after the train bombings in Madrid. Jose Luis Rodrguez Zapatero, the new prime minister, swiftly promised to pull Spanish troops out of Iraq, calling the occupation a ""fiasco"". The Socialists benefited from an unexpectedly high turnout, and from the anger of many voters over the Aznar government's attempt to attribute the bombings to the Basque terrorist group, ETA.
The blame for the bombings was instead ascribed to Islamic terrorists, possibly linked to al-Qaeda, with suspicion falling particularly on several Moroccans. Other European countries, especially Britain and France, were braced to be likely next targets.

IF YOU carry out a well planned atrocity, killing more than 200 people and injuring more than a thousand, and three days later the government that supported an invasion to which you object is unexpectedly defeated in a general election, you are entitled to consider the venture to have been a success. So although Spain's high voting turnout on March 14th, and many Spaniards' apparent ire at the way Jose Mara Aznar's government had prematurely blamed Basque terrorists for the outrage, can be taken as healthily democratic signs ()see page 41, there is no escaping the fact that the biggest triumph has been that of the terrorists. Assuming, as is likely, that they are indeed linked to or are members of Osama bin Laden's al-Qaeda network, they scored another success when the new Socialist prime minister, Jose Luis Rodrguez Zapatero, said he would withdraw Spain's 1,300 troops from Iraq. This may only be a symbolic move, for that is a mere 1% of the American-led coalition's forces there, but symbols and emotions are what terrorism is all about.
To say all that is not to say that it is wrong to vote out governments that supported the invasion of Iraq a year ago. In some cases, such as Spain, they did so against a huge majority of public opinion. In all cases, their claims that Saddam Hussein had stockpiles of dangerous weapons now look to be a blunder, a gamble or a deception. This year both George Bush himself and John Howard, Australia's prime minister, face re-election contests and next year Britain's Tony Blair is also expected to do so. There is now a real possibility that all three could follow Mr Aznar's party into defeat--though Mr Blair may be saved by the fact that his Tory opposition supported the war strongly, too. Such defeats would be natural, in democratic terms. But the tragedy of Madrid is that the terrorists in effect cast the swing vote, given that Mr Aznar's party had looked set to win a comfortable victory, despite opposition to the war, and that such success may now stimulate more terrorism during the other three electoral campaigns. The big question, if such defeats occur, is whether successor governments would be more effective in pursuing al-Qaeda and stabilising the regions within which its terrorists thrive--or less.
One year on
Some critics of the war in Iraq say that there is no such danger. There was no genuine link between toppling Saddam and fighting al-Qaeda, so to punish governments for what opponents claim was an illegal invasion is a quite separate matter. Mr Zapatero even appears to think that pulling troops out of Iraq will make things better, on the view that the occupation is itself the cause of terrorism. Yet that policy is irresponsible, because it increases the risk of civil war in Iraq. Even those who opposed the war should now want to help make Iraq secure enough for Iraqis themselves to take back their sovereignty. If other new governments copy Mr Zapatero and prove their anti-war point by withdrawing from Iraq, they will make everyone less safe as a result. And it is a delusion to claim, as Mr Zapatero does, that all would be well if the UN were to take over from the Americans. Few Iraqis think so. It is as well to recall the Dutch UN peacekeepers who looked on helplessly during the Srebrenica massacre in Bosnia in 1995.
Moreover, withdrawal would put the rest of the Middle East at greater risk, too. For even if there was no direct link between Saddam and al-Qaeda, the connection was always indirect and much more long-term: that while he remained in power to threaten his neighbours and required bombing and sanctions to contain him, it would be impossible to move towards a wider peace and modernisation of that whole troubled region. To advocates of the war, including The Economist, sticking with the status quo looked a more dangerous option than toppling Saddam.
On that view, the stance taken against Saddam by Messrs Bush, Blair, Howard and Aznar could prove to have been politically suicidal but historically noble. But will it, really? One year after the invasion it remains too soon to say. Many things have improved in Iraq since Saddam's regime was removed, but the situation remains fragile and the danger of civil war real ()see pages 27-29. A new opinion poll this week suggested that Iraqis are rather more positive about the change in their lives than outsiders are, but attitudes vary around the country. The invasion itself, and the show of American strength that it entailed, has produced some promising changes in the surrounding region, too, in relations with Libya, Syria, Iran and Pakistan, and glimmerings of democratic reform in Saudi Arabia. Those moves have so far been modest, however, and this week the Saudi authorities underlined that fact by arresting some prominent reformists. Moreover, such modest gains have been overshadowed by the complete lack of progress in pacifying the region's most bitter conflict: that between Israel and the Palestinians.
The right grounds on which to criticise and even condemn the perpetrators of regime change in Iraq now lie in that slow or non-existent regional progress. They, especially the Bush administration, do deserve criticism for their mishandling of the post-war situation in Iraq, but the correct response is to strengthen the effort to rebuild and secure Iraq, not weaken it. They deserve much more criticism, though, for having so far failed to turn the strategic change represented by the fall of Saddam into a wider and more profound set of changes: notably, a restoration of full relations with Iran and the establishment of some sort of Arab-American alliance to persuade the Israelis and Palestinians back to the negotiating table. Such things could never have happened overnight and many a previous attempt, whether American or European, has foundered amid the blood of the Middle East. Yet as the terror in Madrid showed, time is on no one's side. In contrast to its urgency over invading Iraq, the Bush administration has shown little urgency in trying to achieve these wider goals.
Would new governments, led by John Kerry, Mark Latham (in Australia) and Michael Howard (in Britain), do better? It is premature, in all three countries, to judge. No doubt, all would find the reality of government tougher than the theory of opposition. What is clear, though, is that the challenge is the same whether these countries elect new leaders or stick with the old ones: it is to combine the immediate task of detecting and punishing terrorism with the broader, longer-term tasks of blocking weapons proliferation and persuading the Muslim world to modernise. That will require a greater effort to capture al-Qaeda's fugitive leaders in Afghanistan and Pakistan, involving even more pressure on Pakistan's government to catch those terrorists and at the same time to prevent its own nuclear secrets from being sold to them or to other countries. It will require some new version of the tentative ""Greater Middle East Initiative"" for democratic reform just floated and then withdrawn by the Bush administration. And it will require a big new push on Israel and Palestine.
It is fashionable to argue that all this will require greater co-operation, on a multilateral basis, than the Bush administration has managed to achieve during the past three years, and more emphasis on the ""soft"" power of persuasion and influence. That is true, but it will also require military toughness, redoubled intelligence efforts and intensified security. This is no time for weakness or appeasement. That is the ultimate lesson from Madrid.",230,Spain,"Governments come and governments go, but the fight against terrorists must be stronger than ever
IF YOU carry out a well planned atrocity, killing more than 200 people and injuring more than a thousand, and three days later the government that supported an invasion to which you object is unexpectedly defeated in a general election, you are entitled to consider the venture to have been a success. So although Spain's high voting turnout on March 14th, and many Spaniards' apparent ire at the way Jose Mara Aznar's government had prematurely blamed Basque terrorists for the outrage, can be taken as healthily democratic signs ()see page 41, there is no escaping the fact that the biggest triumph has been that of the terrorists. Assuming, as is likely, that they are indeed linked to or are members of Osama bin Laden's al-Qaeda network, they scored another success when the new Socialist prime minister, Jose Luis Rodrguez Zapatero, said he would withdraw Spain's 1,300 troops from Iraq. This may only be a symbolic move, for that is a mere 1% of the American-led coalition's forces there, but symbols and emotions are what terrorism is all about.
To say all that is not to say that it is wrong to vote out governments that supported the invasion of Iraq a year ago. In some cases, such as Spain, they did so against a huge majority of public opinion. In all cases, their claims that Saddam Hussein had stockpiles of dangerous weapons now look to be a blunder, a gamble or a deception. This year both George Bush himself and John Howard, Australia's prime minister, face re-election contests and next year Britain's Tony Blair is also expected to do so. There is now a real possibility that all three could follow Mr Aznar's party into defeat--though Mr Blair may be saved by the fact that his Tory opposition supported the war strongly, too. Such defeats would be natural, in democratic terms. But the tragedy of Madrid is that the terrorists in effect cast the swing vote, given that Mr Aznar's party had looked set to win a comfortable victory, despite opposition to the war, and that such success may now stimulate more terrorism during the other three electoral campaigns. The big question, if such defeats occur, is whether successor governments would be more effective in pursuing al-Qaeda and stabilising the regions within which its terrorists thrive--or less.
One year on
Some critics of the war in Iraq say that there is no such danger. There was no genuine link between toppling Saddam and fighting al-Qaeda, so to punish governments for what opponents claim was an illegal invasion is a quite separate matter. Mr Zapatero even appears to think that pulling troops out of Iraq will make things better, on the view that the occupation is itself the cause of terrorism. Yet that policy is irresponsible, because it increases the risk of civil war in Iraq. Even those who opposed the war should now want to help make Iraq secure enough for Iraqis themselves to take back their sovereignty. If other new governments copy Mr Zapatero and prove their anti-war point by withdrawing from Iraq, they will make everyone less safe as a result. And it is a delusion to claim, as Mr Zapatero does, that all would be well if the UN were to take over from the Americans. Few Iraqis think so.

THE juxtaposition could hardly be sharper. On one side, a prosperous, stable economy and a chancellor brimming with confidence and certainty. On the other, profound insecurity, a growing sense of dread and a prime minister full of foreboding about a threat both ""real and existential"". 
In normal times, a budget intended to set the agenda for the next election would be a political event of the greatest importance. Gordon Brown's long stint at the Treasury has not been without fault, nor has he made the economy quite as immune from future shocks as he boasted when delivering his budget on March 17th. He also continues to be a good deal more optimistic about future tax revenues and a virtuous rebalancing of the economy away from consumption than most commentators are. But for all that, Mr Brown's success is the most solid achievement to which the government can lay claim. He has delivered growth that has not only been uninterrupted over the course of two parliaments, but has also been at a higher rate than in other big European countries. The question of whether he did that by luck or design is unlikely to trouble most voters. 
He has also achieved something matched by no other Labour chancellor: the funding of a large and sustained increase in spending without triggering a crisis in the public finances. Again, he can be criticised for the way he has gone about things, in particular his stubborn determination to pour huge sums of money into the sickly, capacity-constrained health service before the patient could fully absorb the medicine. But despite the waste and the scepticism it has bred, there is mounting evidence that the public services people care about most are slowly improving. And finally, Mr Brown has been a stealthy but effective champion of the poor. 
The chancellor's huge self-satisfaction may not be entirely attractive, but it is understandable. He believes he has established an economic platform from which it is almost unthinkable that Labour will lose the next election. But these are not normal times and, after the appalling events in Spain, thinking the hitherto unthinkable suddenly seems quite a reasonable thing to do. 
Ministers have, of course, been quick to explain why the bombings and the electoral earthquake which followed have changed nothing here. A few people may be less inclined than before to scoff at Tony Blair's apocalyptic warnings, repeated only a fortnight ago in a passionate defence by the prime minister of his policy on global terrorism. Far from being tormented by demons of his own imagining, as some had jeered, Mr Blair has been vindicated, albeit in a ghastly way. 
Many Spanish voters seem to have concluded that the decision to go to war in Iraq had made America's coalition partners more vulnerable to attack. This, say ministers, misses the point. The September 11th hijackers didn't need the Iraq war as a pretext. Besides, Britain, because of what it represents, has always been near the top of the al-Qaeda target list. No country, least of all Britain, can opt out of the war on terror. Nobody is under any illusion: no matter how much luck and skill you might have in combating the terrorists, something terrible is bound to happen at some stage. 
And if the worst does occur, say in London, the political fall-out will be less dramatic here. After all, the main opposition party unequivocally supported the war and still does. Britons were far less hostile to the war than were the Spanish: Britain remains fairly evenly divided over it, while in Spain over 90% thought it wrong. Anyway, ministers protest, the Spanish government made the fatal mistake of trying to gain political advantage from a terrorist outrage by pinning it on the wrong set of murderers: this government would never do that.
Like much else said about the war on terror, this is only partly convincing. In the first place, although there were strong arguments for the war in Iraq, among the weakest were those that claimed it was integral to the war on terror. Mr Blair deserves credit for being one of the first political leaders to understand how the world was changed by September 11th, and this newspaper thinks he was right to support America in getting rid of Saddam Hussein. But many people who are serious about fighting al-Qaeda quite reasonably ask whether invading Iraq helped or hindered that effort. Mr Blair's insistence on conflating the two does not help him. 
Bombs and ballots
Britain was indeed under threat before the bombs in Spain, but those bombs may well have increased the threat. The terrorists have seen how effectively their bombs can leverage unhappiness over the war. Mr Blair can't say it, but he knows that the response of Spanish voters and their new prime minister, Jose Luis Rodrguez Zapatero, to the assault on their society has made hitting Britain even more tempting to al-Qaeda.
Despite the official line, the possibility of a major terrorist spectacular during the election campaign is now being taken very seriously (although the lack of a fixed election date will hinder the terrorists' planning). But nobody can gauge what the political impact of such an attack would be. A poll carried out this week by YouGov for Sky News found that 75% believed that Britain's role in the Iraq war had made the country more vulnerable. However, with no plausible beneficiary of the voters' anger except the anti-war Liberal Democrats, the outcome of the election might well be unaffected. 
But what of Mr Blair? People believe, rightly, that Iraq was Mr Blair's war. Without his fervour and conviction, Britain might not have fought. If the bombs go off, how will they judge Mr Blair?

BY UNEXPECTEDLY returning the Socialists to power, the Spanish election on March 14th has delivered almost as big a shock to Spain, and the world, as the train bombings in Madrid did three days earlier. But, though many were quick to accuse Spanish voters of appeasement in the face of terror, the truth of what happened and what it means is more complex.
The March 11th bombings merit first attention. The death toll is now 201, making this the most savage attack that Spain has suffered since the civil war of 1936-39. At first it was blamed by the People's Party (PP) government of Jose Mara Aznar on the Basque terrorist group, ETA, which was known to be planning a spectacular outrage in Madrid. But all later evidence has pointed to Islamist terrorists, possibly linked to al-Qaeda (see next story).
The cack-handed attempt to blame ETA, combined with renewed doubts over Mr Aznar's support for the war in Iraq, turned the election round. Though the party's lead had been narrowing, opinion polls had pointed to a win for the PP, under Mr Aznar's hand-picked successor, Mariano Rajoy. In the event, the Socialists under Jose Luis Rodrguez Zapatero won 42.6% of the votes and 164 seats in the 350-seat Cortes, a big jump from the 125 it won in 2000. The PP got only 37.6% of the votes and 148 seats, down from 183 in 2000. Turnout rose to 77%, from 69% in 2000. 
The result sent tremors round the world, especially when Mr Zapatero's first announcement as prospective prime minister was that he would, as promised, withdraw Spanish troops from Iraq. He unceremoniously reproached George Bush and Tony Blair for going to war ""on the basis of lies"". And he promised a more emollient approach to old European Union allies, delighting France and Germany.
What caused the upheaval? A frightened and disorientated electorate voted with a knee-jerk reaction, said senior PP officials. The voters have done the work of al-Qaeda, some added bitterly. In that the bombings changed the result, they were right. But the underlying reasons may be less flattering to the PP.
The biggest was the three days when the government and the heavily state-influenced media insisted that ETA was the culprit. The assumption was that, if it was ETA, that would be good for the PP, as it would vindicate Mr Aznar's hardline stand against both terrorism and Basque separatism; but if it was an Islamic terrorist group, the PP would suffer, because 90% of Spaniards had opposed the war in Iraq. ""A critical point was reached in a spectacular way. We stressed for years: the PP are lying and distorting the truth. It took an important time, when people needed the truth, to discover the level of manipulation, and that day was March 11th,"" says Juan Fernando Lopez Aguilar, a confidant of Mr Zapatero and member of the Socialist Party's national executive. 
The second important factor was higher turnout. The emotional impact of the bombings seems to have persuaded many Spaniards to do their democratic duty and vote. Most were hitherto dormant Socialist supporters. As many as 2m were new young voters, who came of age during Mr Aznar's mishandling of the Prestige oil spill in 2002 and the subsequent war on Iraq. ""For the first time in 10-15 years, the majority of 18-30-year olds were voting for the Socialists, but again the message that people wanted change did not surface, because of the PP's stranglehold on the media,"" says Mr Lopez Aguilar.
Also, after eight years of the PP and a growing fatigue over Mr Aznar's authoritarian style, Mr Rajoy's chances of winning may never have been as sure as they looked. The bid to sell him as the same product but with an improved tone did not mobilise voters. The PP even began to believe its own propaganda. Strangely, so did everybody else: it was no secret that hardly anyone in the Socialist camp expected to win. Yet Mr Aznar was never as personally popular as his charismatic Socialist predecessor, Felipe Gonzlez. In a crisis, people proved ready to back away from him and his party.
In Catalonia and the Basque country, both the blaming of the bombings on ETA and Mr Aznar's fierce anti-regional rhetoric backfired spectacularly. His government demonised the Socialists when their coalition partner in the Catalan regional government, the Catalan Republican Left (ERC), was found to have done a secret deal that led ETA to declare a ceasefire limited to Catalonia. The ERC jumped to fourth political power in Spain, with eight seats in the Cortes, up from one in 2000. In Catalonia the Socialists won almost four times as many seats as the PP, which has now become almost a fringe party in the region. In the Basque country, the PP slumped from second to third, behind both PNV nationalists and Socialists. 
Mr Zapatero, known for his youth as Bambi, will form a minority government that will function, like some previous governments, by forming informal alliances with nationalist and left-wing parties. He lacks the fiery rhetoric of Mr Gonzlez, who was prime minister from 1982 to 1996. But his style is attractive after the years of bad blood created by Mr Aznar's high-handed manner.
In a marked change, Mr Zapatero telephoned the Basque leader, Juan Jose Ibarretxe, instantly restoring relations between Madrid and the region. Mr Aznar had not spoken to Mr Ibarretxe since 2001. Mr Zapatero's first statements on foreign policy signalled that Spain would return to its old loyalties in Europe (see Charlemagne) rather than its newer pro-American stance. He also wants to revive the notion of Spain as a link between Latin America and the EU.
Mr Zapatero's domestic policy is less clear. Before the election, he appointed a committee of notables who are a mixture of new savvy and safe old guard. According to his circle, Miguel Sebastin, who is not a party member, will be finance minister. An economist and a former banker, he wants to reduce government intervention in business, combat tax fraud and support innovation, research and development. But the new government may also reintroduce labour-market regulations that Mr Aznar had sensibly junked.
Elsewhere Jose Bono, regional president of Castile La Mancha and a party strongman, is expected to be security minister. Javier Solana may be recalled from Brussels to be foreign minister. Jesus Caldera, Mr Zapatero's right-hand man, will surely have a plum job; a grand old man of the left, Gregorio Peces Barba, could head the culture ministry; Mara Jess Sansegundo will get education.
Optimistic Socialist voters talk of a second democratic transition. Areas where Mr Aznar had failed to make improvements, such as government control of the powerful state media and Madrid's testy relations with the regions, may see early action. As crowds gathered to celebrate Mr Zapatero's victory in Madrid, hundreds of young people chanted: ""Don't let us down!"" No doubt he will try not to; but assuming office when his country has just been bloodied by international terrorists will present a huge challenge to an inexperienced prime minister.",230,Spain,"The surprise election victory of the Socialists, under Jose Luis Rodrguez Zapatero, has changed Spain's--and Europe's--political map

Mr Zapatero, known for his youth as Bambi, will form a minority government that will function, like some previous governments, by forming informal alliances with nationalist and left-wing parties. He lacks the fiery rhetoric of Mr Gonzlez, who was prime minister from 1982 to 1996. But his style is attractive after the years of bad blood created by Mr Aznar's high-handed manner.
In a marked change, Mr Zapatero telephoned the Basque leader, Juan Jose Ibarretxe, instantly restoring relations between Madrid and the region. Mr Aznar had not spoken to Mr Ibarretxe since 2001. Mr Zapatero's first statements on foreign policy signalled that Spain would return to its old loyalties in Europe (see Charlemagne) rather than its newer pro-American stance. He also wants to revive the notion of Spain as a link between Latin America and the EU.
Mr Zapatero's domestic policy is less clear. Before the election, he appointed a committee of notables who are a mixture of new savvy and safe old guard. According to his circle, Miguel Sebastin, who is not a party member, will be finance minister. An economist and a former banker, he wants to reduce government intervention in business, combat tax fraud and support innovation, research and development. But the new government may also reintroduce labour-market regulations that Mr Aznar had sensibly junked.
Elsewhere Jose Bono, regional president of Castile La Mancha and a party strongman, is expected to be security minister. Javier Solana may be recalled from Brussels to be foreign minister. Jesus Caldera, Mr Zapatero's right-hand man, will surely have a plum job; a grand old man of the left, Gregorio Peces Barba, could head the culture ministry; Mara Jess Sansegundo will get education.
Optimistic Socialist voters talk of a second democratic transition. Areas where Mr Aznar had failed to make improvements, such as government control of the powerful state media and Madrid's testy relations with the regions, may see early action. As crowds gathered to celebrate Mr Zapatero's victory in Madrid, hundreds of young people chanted: ""Don't let us down!"" No doubt he will try not to; but assuming office when his country has just been bloodied by international terrorists will present a huge challenge to an inexperienced prime minister.",True

THE bombs that altered the course of the Spanish elections have also reshaped European politics. The departure of Jose Mara Aznar and his People's Party will shift the balance of power within the European Union. Broadly speaking, this is good for France and Germany, and bad for Britain and Poland. It is good for European federalists and bad for Eurosceptics and Atlanticists. In theory, it is good for the left and bad for the right, because conservatives were beaten by Socialists. But nominally left-wing governments in Britain and Poland are mourning, and a right-wing French government is cheering. Left-right divisions are no longer the chief determinant of tribal loyalties in Europe. It is attitudes to the United States and the future of the EU that matter now.
Mr Aznar's most crucial policy choice was to embrace America's war on terrorism and the toppling of Saddam Hussein. He chose this path partly for reasons internal to Spain, notably the long struggle against the Basque terrorist group, ETA. But he also believed that Spain, as a country on the rise, could aspire to be a global power, forging new alliances in the Americas and in Europe. Under the Socialist government of Felipe Gonzlez, he felt, Spain had too often passively followed a line determined by France and Germany.
Mr Aznar made little secret of his contempt for the ossified economies and leadership pretensions of the big two. He dismissed France's efforts to protect its language and film industry as a ""symptom of a culture in decline"". His most recent foreign minister, Ana Palacio, loudly deplored Franco-German efforts to dominate the EU. Such attitudes caused deep offence in Paris and Berlin (Mr Aznar had famously bad relations with both Jacques Chirac and Gerhard Schroder), but secretly delighted Britain's Tony Blair. 
The significance of the Aznar-inspired shift in Spanish thinking became most evident in the run-up to the Iraq war. The claim by France and Germany to speak for Europe was decisively undermined in January 2003 by the now-famous ""letter of eight"", a pro-American declaration by eight European governments--Britain, Italy, Poland, Portugal, Denmark, the Czech Republic, Hungary and Spain--that was co-ordinated by Mr Aznar's people. As well as being a gesture of support for the Bush administration, it had an undeclared sub-text about the EU. Henceforth France and Germany could no longer presume that, wherever they led, the rest of the EU would naturally follow.
Spain's Socialist Party always denounced this shift away from the big European powers and towards America. They drew strength from the fact that some 90% of Spanish people opposed the Iraq war. Jose Luis Rodrguez Zapatero, the Socialist leader who will now become prime minister, accused the Aznar government of serving only ""the interests of Bush"" and of betraying Spain's traditional commitment to ""pro-European"" policies. He had already sworn to restore previously ""magnificent"" relations with France and Germany.
Now that Spain has, in essence, switched sides within a divided Europe, this could tip the European Union's fragile power balance. One EU official goes so far as to say that ""with the disappearance of Aznar, the alternative pillar to France and Germany crumbles."" It certainly looks a lot weaker. Italy's Silvio Berlusconi, though pro-American, has a reputation for eccentricity and dodgy dealings that make him an alarming ally. He is also vulnerable to Spanish-style assaults from the anti-war left. Poland is a poor country, led by a weak and unstable government. The Dutch, Portuguese and Danes are not big enough to make a counterweight to the French, Germans and Spanish. Nor are the Hungarians or Czechs; some of their top diplomats have anyway long said privately that they had made a mistake in signing the ""letter of eight"". The upshot may be to leave Mr Blair isolated.
From A to Z
Europe is now waiting expectantly to see how Mr Zapatero's anti-war, pro-European rhetoric translates into actual policy. Even EU officials close to Mr Zapatero's party believe that he will have to ""get himself off the hook"" of campaign rhetoric that strayed into isolationism and pacifism. The highest-profile issue is, obviously, his pledge to pull Spanish troops out of Iraq if a new United Nations mandate is not forthcoming by the end of June. It may be that some form of ""internationalisation"" of the nation-building process in Iraq will allow Mr Zapatero to soften his position. Less remarked upon, so far, has been his party's commitment to cut Spain's already nugatory level of defence spending. This would dismay not just the Americans but also many of Spain's EU (and NATO) partners. 
European leaders will get a chance to assess Mr Zapatero at their summit in Brussels next week. This meeting had been expected to concentrate on economic reforms (the so-called ""Lisbon"" agenda, which Mr Aznar played a key role in devising), but it will now be overshadowed by terrorism and security issues. There have been calls for a European CIA, reflecting the instinct of federalists that, whatever the problem, ""more Europe"" is always the solution.
More significant may be confirmation that Mr Zapatero's arrival will make it a lot easier to agree the new EU constitution. It was largely Spanish and Polish objections to a new voting system--the ""double majority""--that scuppered efforts to strike a deal at December's EU summit. But Mr Zapatero has signalled that he will accept double majority, raising the prospect that the isolated Poles may have to fold. In fact, this concession was one that the Aznar government had already hinted at. But the new Spanish government may influence the constitution in other ways. The Socialists favour pan-European tax harmonisation, for instance; one more reason for Mr Blair and the British to regret the passing of Jose Mara Aznar.",230,Spain,"Spain's new government shifts the balance in the European Union

THE Bush administration did its best to take the Spanish election result in its stride. George Bush was one of the first world leaders to telephone Jose Luis Rodrguez Zapatero, Spain's prime-minister-elect, with his congratulations. Colin Powell insisted that ""the Spanish people remain committed to the war against terrorists"", while officials declared that they are offering Spain all the help they can to discover who was behind the bombings. 
Yet the election result is clearly a serious blow. The withdrawal of Spanish troops from Iraq, if it comes to that, will have little military significance: Spain has only 1,300 troops there, compared with Poland's 2,500 and America's 150,000. But the loss of Spanish support for Mr Bush has big diplomatic ramifications. 
Jose Mara Aznar's defeat not only removed the second-most-important American ally on Iraq after Britain's prime minister, Tony Blair. It also demonstrated that foreign leaders may pay a high price at home for their support for Mr Bush's war on terrorism. A year ago this week Mr Aznar stood at Mr Bush's side at a summit meeting in the Azores; now his country is led by a man who, during last October's Columbus Day military parade, made a point of sitting down as the American flag passed by, saying that ""It's not my flag.""
The fall of Spain's Popular Party severely limits the amount of pressure that America can put on its other allies, such as Britain and Poland. It also delivers a severe body-blow to American dreams of putting together a coalition of ""New European"" countries to counterbalance ""Old European"" places such as France and Germany (see page 48).
It is too early to judge what impact all this will have on the election race. The Democrats clearly have a good chance of using the Spanish election results to reinforce their claim that Mr Bush is alienating longstanding allies and thereby weakening the common stand on terrorism. But they need to handle this carefully. Howard Dean caused a furore when he told a group of reporters that Mr Bush's decision to send troops to Iraq contributed to the deaths in Madrid. The Kerry campaign immediately scrambled to dissociate itself from Mr Dean--and Democrats across the country offered thanks to God that they had not chosen him as their presidential candidate. 
Even if they can avoid Dean-style gaffes, the Spanish debacle poses two serious problems for the Democrats. The first is that anything that puts the spotlight back on terrorism strengthens Mr Bush. A recent Washington Post/ABC poll showed that Mr Kerry leads Mr Bush in eight policy areas, including the economy, education and health care; but Mr Bush leads Mr Kerry in the war on terrorism, by 21 points. 
On March 14th Dick Cheney told an audience in Florence, Kentucky, that the bombings in Spain were ""a reminder that there are evil people in the world, capable of any atrocity, and determined to take innocent life."" He also criticised Mr Kerry for regarding terrorism mainly as a matter of law enforcement rather than military action. ""He's embraced the strategy of the 1990s, which holds that when we are attacked, we ought to round up those directly responsible, put them on trial, and then call it a day.""
The second problem for the Democrats is that many Americans interpreted the Spanish election result as evidence that it is dangerous to put too much faith in foreign countries. Dennis Hastert, the House speaker, spoke for rank-and-file Republicans when he accused the Spanish of ""appeasement"". But this line of argument was not confined to Republicans. American newspapers were full of laments that the Spanish electorate had responded to the attacks in Madrid in exactly the way that the terrorists had hoped--and replaced a pro-American government with one that is much softer on terrorism. 
Edward Luttwak, a fierce critic of the war in Iraq, argued that the ""Zapateros of Europe"" are ""bent on validating the crudest caricatures of 'old European' cowardly decadence"". The more middle-of-the-road Washington Post wrote an editorial sharply critical of Romano Prodi's view that the events in Spain prove that force is not the answer to terrorism. ""Should such sentiments prevail,"" the Post argued, ""the next US administration--whether led by President Bush or Senator John F. Kerry--may have no alternative to unilateralism.""
A few days after the Spanish election result, a comprehensive study of global attitudes by the Pew Research Centre at the University of Maryland provided yet further evidence that, when it comes to fighting, America really is from Mars and Europe from Venus. America is the only country where a majority of people (60%) favour the war in Iraq. Support for that war has plummeted in America's closest ally, Britain, from 61% last May to 43% today--and remains negligible across western Europe. Many people in France (57%) and Germany (49%) believe that America is exaggerating the threat of terrorism. There is strong and growing support across Europe for the European Union becoming a powerful counterweight to America. 
Whether all this really leaves America with no alternative to unilateralism may be open to doubt. But both the United States and Europe clearly have a great deal of work to do if they are not to see transatlantic solidarity against Islamic terrorism dissolving in fratricidal dissent.",230,Spain,"Yet more reason to worry about those Europeans

A FEW months after the last election, Tony Blair outlined what he described as the four strategic priorities for his second term. The first was to maintain a stable economy. The second was to reduce social division and inequality. The third was to improve public services. The fourth was to settle the argument over Europe in favour of constructive engagement and against Tory ""isolationism"".
There are few complaints about the government's macroeconomic management and it has had some success combating poverty, if not inequality. Albeit slowly and patchily, public services are responding to a lot of money and a little reform. But, by his own lights, it is Europe that has to go down as the prime minister's greatest failure. 
In the House of Commons this week, as he delivered his report on the European Council meeting in Brussels, there were hints of the old evangelism. However, what fired him was not the summit he had just attended or the prospect of reaching agreement on the constitutional treaty (it's a while since Mr Blair referred to it as a constitution), but the ferocity of Michael Howard's attack. Mr Blair's contempt for the Tories' position on Europe is genuine. He believes that Mr Howard is a peddler of dangerous myths and his promise that a future Conservative government would renegotiate the treaty is a fantasy. 
What is somewhat harder to gauge is the state of Mr Blair's own enthusiasm for Europe these days. For someone who has often enough declared it his intention to resolve once and for all Britain's historic ambivalence towards Europe, the prime minister these days sounds pretty ambivalent himself. He still believes that a final resolution of Britain's place in Europe is entirely desirable, but he no longer knows how to achieve it or whether it is even possible. 
He used to think it would result from joining the euro. Although it is less than a year since he fought a doughty rearguard action against Gordon Brown, the chancellor, to keep open that option in the current parliament, that seems awfully long ago. It is hardly Mr Blair's fault. The wretched performance of the French and German economies compared with Britain's and the near-farce of the stability and growth pact have helped destroy the possibility of a positive outcome. There is no reason why an unwinnable referendum should hold any attraction for the prime minister. The idea, once persistently touted within Downing Street, that Mr Blair believed taking Britain into the euro was essential to his legacy, is now rarely mentioned. 
An alternative, as siren voices urge him, would be to use a referendum on the European constitution as the means of resolving Britain's ambivalence to Europe. As Mr Blair puts it, there is a clear choice between his aim of making a Europe of 25 nations work effectively and Mr Howard's willingness to renegotiate the fundamentals of British membership of the EU. He maintains that if that is the argument, he has no doubt who will win it. 
In which case, why does the prime minister not call Mr Howard's bluff and hold a referendum? The first reason always trotted out is what Mr Blair calls ""the elephant in the room""; namely Britain's chiefly Europhobic newspapers. The second is the fear that a referendum might monopolise the political agenda for the six months before the general election. Mr Blair is sensitive to accusations that he has spent too much time on foreign policy and not enough on domestic bread-and-butter issues. Even if he were confident of winning, the damage to the government's electoral prospects could be significant. For Mr Blair, sticking to the unheroic line that no referendum is needed to ratify a treaty of less consequence than either Maastricht (1992) or the Single European Act (1986) is politically a no-brainer. 
Not much fun
But what Europhiles, who used to pin their hopes on Mr Blair, detect is not just an unwillingness to take risks for Europe's sake, but also a cooling of the prime minister's former ardour. They are right. Partly, it's Iraq. Although, at a practical level, relations with France and Germany are better, underlined by the three-country summit in Berlin five weeks ago, Mr Blair has not forgiven President Jacques Chirac for the deliberate sabotage of his attempts to secure a second UN resolution. And with the departure from the scene of Jose Mara Aznar, Mr Blair finds himself without kindred spirits when he attends European summits like the one last weekend. As a Downing Street insider observed: ""He's a bit short of playmates at these things.""
Most of all, Mr Blair worries about what he describes as a coming together of the left and the far right in Europe, united in loathing both America and globalisation. During his visit to Spain last week to attend a mass for the victims of March 11th and to meet the new Socialist prime minister, Jose Luis Rodrguez Zapatero, he looked uncomfortable. According to one aide: ""There was something not very pleasant in the atmosphere."" Mr Blair is hoping that the arrival of the ten, mainly Atlanticist, accession countries will improve things. It will need to.
Mr Blair's predecessor, John Major, seemed quite happy to become a peripheral figure in Europe. Mr Blair is not. Mr Howard may boast that he would welcome isolation if it is the price for defending Britain's interests, but that is not Mr Blair's way. More than ever, he believes it is important for Britain's voice to be heard in Europe, whether it is making the case for always working closely with America, pushing for faster economic reform or arguing for the next stage of enlargement, including the admission of Turkey. 
But by defining Europe's priorities in those terms, Mr Blair reveals just how different Britain continues to be. Britain's ambivalence towards Europe endures because it is real and deep-rooted. It also happens to be personified in Mr Blair himself.",230,Spain,"Tony Blair thought he could change Britain's relationship with Europe. It's not his fault he's failed

Most of all, Mr Blair worries about what he describes as a coming together of the left and the far right in Europe, united in loathing both America and globalisation. During his visit to Spain last week to attend a mass for the victims of March 11th and to meet the new Socialist prime minister, Jose Luis Rodrguez Zapatero, he looked uncomfortable. According to one aide: ""There was something not very pleasant in the atmosphere."" Mr Blair is hoping that the arrival of the ten, mainly Atlanticist, accession countries will improve things. It will need to.
Mr Blair's predecessor, John Major, seemed quite happy to become a peripheral figure in Europe. Mr Blair is not. Mr Howard may boast that he would welcome isolation if it is the price for defending Britain's interests, but that is not Mr Blair's way. More than ever, he believes it is important for Britain's voice to be heard in Europe, whether it is making the case for always working closely with America, pushing for faster economic reform or arguing for the next stage of enlargement, including the admission of Turkey. 
But by defining Europe's priorities in those terms, Mr Blair reveals just how different Britain continues to be. Britain's ambivalence towards Europe endures because it is real and deep-rooted. It also happens to be personified in Mr Blair himself.",True

WITH an election expected later this year, and the opposition Labor Party powerfully invigorated under Mark Latham, its latest leader, the prospects for John Howard winning a fourth term as prime minister have been looking a bit dim of late. Youthful and dynamic, and deftly able to steer the political agenda towards issues such as health and education, where Labor resonates strongly with voters, Mr Latham has opened up a commanding lead for the party over Mr Howard's conservative coalition since he took over the leadership just four months ago.
That dream run may now be ending. Apparently emboldened by a sense that Australians wanted to put their military contribution to the war in Iraq behind them, Mr Latham said on March 23rd that, if Labor wins the election, he will bring the troops home by Christmas. There were echoes of the Spanish election on March 14th, soon after terrorist bombings in Madrid, and the pledge by Jose Luis Rodrguez Zapatero, the Spanish leader-elect, to withdraw Spain's troops from Iraq. Mr Latham went further: unlike Mr Zapatero, he did not attach as a condition for leaving the troops there the possibility of the UN taking more responsibility in Iraq. 
He announced his plan in a Sydney radio interview--and was careful to hedge it with qualifications. Once Australia's responsibility was discharged after the handover to a sovereign authority in Iraq in July, he said, a Latham government would be hoping to have the troops back by Christmas: hardly revolutionary, given that Labor originally opposed the Howard government's despatch of troops to take part in the American-led invasion. Australia has about 850 troops in the Gulf region; Mr Latham's withdrawal plan involves only the 350 or so serving in Iraq.
Yet this was enough to provide Mr Howard with the chink in Mr Latham's armour that has eluded him so far. He went for it, accusing Mr Latham of ""cutting and running"", and of ""capricious policy-making on the run"".
Mr Latham hit back in kind, calling Mr Howard a politician at the end of his career. He said he had concluded after a briefing from a top intelligence official in January that the government's policy in Iraq was an ""absolute fiasco"".
There were signs, however, that some of Mr Latham's colleagues were taken by surprise by Mr Latham's pronouncement. Kevin Rudd, the probable foreign minister in a Latham government, was quick to qualify his leader's remarks by saying Labor saw a strong moral commitment to Iraq's economic reconstruction--though there was ""no correlation between making aid and having a military garrison there"". An opinion poll on March 30th suggested Mr Latham could have made his first political blunder; it reported 61% of Australians thought their troops should stay in Iraq ""until the job is done"" against 35% who wanted them ""brought home now"" (not, it is true, precisely Mr Latham's proposal). 
Mr Howard has made Australian military excursions in the Pacific region, and further afield under America's umbrella, a hallmark of his eight-year premiership. He will use the row over the troops in Iraq to push the issues of security and economic management, on which Australians have consistently trusted the coalition government more than Labor, back to the forefront of the election campaign. But the dispute holds risks for both leaders. 
Mr Howard may be right when he says the American alliance is ""very central to the Australian psyche"". Yet he may also be overstating the degree. It is entirely probable that Australians want their troops to stay in Iraq for the time being, mainly to help the Iraqis restore their lives rather than to shore up a relationship with Washington that many feel has grown a bit too deferential under Mr Howard.
For his part, Mr Latham risks being cast as a leader impulsively reacting to events. He made his ""back by Christmas"" remark days after Mr Zapatero's promise, and another opinion poll that showed 65% of Australians believed their country's involvement in the Iraq war had made a terrorist attack in Australia more likely.

""THE inner circle of people who committed the terrorist acts are either behind bars or dead."" Thus the Spanish interior minister, ngel Acebes, the day after up to six Islamist terrorists suspected of carrying out the train bombings in Madrid on March 11th had blown themselves up after being cornered by police in a flat in the Madrid suburb of Leganes on April 3rd. Yet Mr Acebes's words did little to reassure Spaniards. Their mood was of nervous expectation, after Mr Acebes conceded that as many as three suspected terrorists might have escaped, possibly with explosives, before the police had managed to cordon off the area. 
Security has been ramped up everywhere. Police patrolled the Madrid metro for the first time, and security at airports, nuclear plants and in Seville, where pilgrims are gathering for Easter processions, has tightened. Last week the government said it would use the army to guard the railways, after explosives were found on the Madrid-Seville high-speed track. A total of 16 suspects are now in custody; 15 have been charged, 11 of them Moroccans. 
The terrorists were tracked to the flat in Leganes thanks to their use of pre-paid mobile-phone cards from the batch that had been used to detonate the Madrid train bombs. But the suspects refused to give themselves up and, as a unit of special police broke in, one man inside detonated a huge bomb that blasted masonry and body parts across the street. One policeman was killed. Police found 200 detonators and 10kg (22lb) of explosives in the rubble. The body of one suspect was found in the block's empty swimming-pool, wearing an explosive belt of the type used by Palestinian suicide-bombers.
Four corpses from the blast have so far been identified. One was Serhane Ben Abdelmajid Fakhet, known as ""the Tunisian"" and considered by the investigating magistrate to be the ""mastermind and co-ordinator"" of the Madrid attacks. Another was Jamal Ahmidan, a Moroccan nicknamed ""el Chino"" or ""Mowgli"", the suspected leader of the bombers and one of six men for whom arrest warrants were issued the previous week. A third, Abdennabi Kounjaa, was on that list; the fourth, Asri Rifaat Anouar, a Moroccan, was not. Three fresh suspects were later named.
Two days after the Leganes blast, 13 suspected members of the same terrorist group that Spain says carried out the Madrid bombings were arrested in France. They are suspected of involvement in the bombings in Casablanca last May that killed 33 people (plus 12 suicide-bombers). They were not directly involved in the Madrid bombings, said France's interior ministry. But they belonged to the same outfit, the Moroccan Islamic Combatant Group (GICM), thought to be behind them.
The climate of fear was increased by a letter faxed to a Spanish newspaper, ABC, purportedly from al-Qaeda, which threatened more attacks that would ""make blood flow like rivers"" in Spain. The letter, signed in the name of ""Ansar al-Qaeda"" by Abu Dujana al Afgani, the name used in a videotape claiming responsibility for the train bombings, said that Spain should withdraw its troops from Iraq and Afghanistan or face ""hellish"" consequences.
In fact, the Socialist prime minister-elect, Jose Luis Rodrguez Zapatero, who is due to take office later this month, has promised to honour his pre-election pledge of withdrawing the troops in Iraq unless the UN takes charge by June 30th. To show his determination to fight terrorism, however, he has promised to double the number of Spanish troops (from 125) in Afghanistan. But Mr Zapatero still has work to do to persuade Spain's allies (and enemies) not to misconstrue the withdrawal as a victory for terrorism. Meanwhile, Spanish troops came under attack at the Al-Andalus base near Najaf, in Iraq, the day after the Leganes blast.

""AND now to work, to fulfil commitments, to honour my word."" Thus Jose Luis Rodrguez Zapatero, on becoming Spain's fifth prime minister since the restoration of democracy after Franco's death in 1975. It was three days after Islamist terrorists struck in the Madrid train-bombings on March 11th that Mr Zapatero's Socialist Party won a surprise election victory; but, with just 164 seats, it was 12 short of an absolute majority in the Cortes, Spain's parliament. Last week, however, Mr Zapatero won parliamentary backing as head of a minority government by 183 votes to 148 (with 19 abstentions).
Mr Zapatero secured the support of 19 non-Socialist deputies, mainly from radical Catalan nationalists and the hard left. The mainstream Catalan nationalists and the Basque Nationalist Party abstained. But even such a loose alliance with nationalist groups that want greater autonomy from Madrid prompted a warning from the leader of the opposition People's Party, Mariano Rajoy, that this was ""a weak and unstable government"".
Yet after the stifling dogmatism of Jose Mara Aznar's People's Party government, Mr Zapatero's arrival has brought a welcome breeze of change. ""I will govern for all with respect and with humility,"" he said. The mantra of this 43-year-old career politician, who trained as a lawyer but has never served in any senior government position, is ""dialogue and consensus"".
In his most striking act, Mr Zapatero is to honour his campaign pledge to withdraw Spanish troops from Iraq. He is doing it faster than expected: within 24 hours of taking office he announced that the withdrawal would take place as soon as possible. The defence minister, Jose Bono, said this meant within six weeks. Why the haste? Because there was no prospect of the UN taking command in Iraq before or after June 30th (when formal sovereignty is to be handed over to an Iraqi government), said Mr Zapatero. America's George Bush rebuked him for his abruptness. Honduras, which has a small force under Spanish command in Iraq, is now also planning to withdraw its troops. 
Beyond Iraq, Mr Zapatero has divulged little detail of his policy plans, but he has given strong hints of their likely direction. He has pledged to fight terrorism ""in all its forms"" and--perhaps to make up for the Iraqi withdrawal--to bolster the small Spanish contingent serving in Afghanistan. He wants to shift foreign policy to a more European line. He gave early backing to the draft European Union constitution. His foreign minister, Miguel Angel Moratinos, a former EU envoy to the Middle East who joined the Socialist Party only shortly before the elections, has said that the Nice treaty, which gave Spain (and Poland) disproportionately generous voting weights, and which Mr Aznar defended to the hilt, ""is not indispensable"".
Immediately after Mr Zapatero's installation, Mr Moratinos flew to Washington to try to smooth feathers ruffled over Iraq. He is offering non-military co-operation in Iraq, and help on reconstruction. But it is not clear exactly what this will amount to. Mr Zapatero himself is making his first overseas visit as prime minister to Morocco, with which Mr Aznar's government got on notably badly.
On the domestic front
Mr Zapatero has pleased Spain's restive regions by agreeing to consider ""reasonable"" modifications to the constitution. He has said he will oppose the so-called Ibarretxe plan, the Basque government's proposal to hold a referendum on the right of self-determination. But Mr Zapatero's first encounter with reality in the regions may come in Catalonia, if the radical nationalists, who are in partnership with the Socialists in the regional government, do not think his constitutional modifications go far enough. As another sop he has pledged to campaign for Catalan to be made an official EU language.
Mr Zapatero has also announced something of a social revolution. His government intends to change the law of male primogeniture to allow the Spanish crown to be inherited by a woman. He will relax abortion laws and tighten legislation on domestic violence. He also plans to reduce religious instruction in state schools, and to improve gay rights. Other electoral pledges, such as making more Spanish children bilingual by sending teachers abroad for a month to learn English, and reducing housing costs for young families by providing 180,000 subsidised homes every year, may run into financial obstacles. But one decision popular with greens was to scrap the national hydrology plan to siphon water from the River Ebro in north-east Spain to the parched south.
In marked contrast to Felipe Gonzlez, a previous Socialist prime minister who was accused of taking the party for granted, Mr Zapatero will hold a weekly meeting with party bigwigs: the wheeler-dealing Alfredo Perez Rubalcaba, who will act as a parliamentary broker, and Jose Blanco, who will control the party. Within the cabinet, the key minister after Mr Moratinos will be Pedro Solbes at finance. Mr Solbes held the same post in Mr Gonzalez's last Socialist government, in 1993-96. He is credited with taking the first steps to prepare Spain's economy for the euro. As European commissioner for economic affairs, he was also a staunch defender of the euro area's stability and growth pact, which sets limits on budget deficits, so he is unlikely to be fiscally incontinent.
Mr Zapatero has promised that Spaniards' overall tax burden will not rise, but has also said that he will simplify the tax code as part of a programme to modernise the economy ""so that well-being spreads to all."" Mr Solbes is, however, reported to have demanded ""absolute power"" to run economic policy. He inherits a bullish stockmarket and a content business community. But unemployment remains the highest in the EU, at 11.2%; and there are concerns about a potential property bubble and high debts that could turn into problems if euro-area interest rates rise.
The justice ministry has gone to the academic-minded Juan Fernandez Lopez Aguilar; the interior ministry to Jose Antonio Alonso, a magistrate and a personal friend of Mr Zapatero, who represents Leon, the prime minister's home town. Elsewhere, Spain's traditional cronyism seems to be at work, as Mr Zapatero places party nominees and favourites into a mass of official and semi-official jobs.
It was Mr Bono's inaugural speech as defence minister that was most at odds with the consensual spirit of the new government. Mr Bono said he would be proud to die defending his country against terrorists and false patriots. He fondly remembered his Falangist father and reaffirmed his Roman Catholic credentials. He accused the opposition of a lack of testosterone for not showing up to his investiture ceremony, and he harangued regional nationalists. The 53-year-old, who had been premier of the Castile-La Mancha region ever since 1983, was promptly dubbed outmoded and a fascist by his party's Catalan nationalist allies.

""WE SEE Iraq as a very complex country, with many different ethnic groups, a tradition of violence, and no experience of democracy. You can't create democracy with bombs."" So wrote Jean-David Levitte, the French ambassador to the United States in the New York Times in February 2003, justifying his country's opposition to the impending American invasion of Iraq. As the United States sinks deeper into trouble in Iraq, the European countries that opposed the war are resisting the temptation to gloat--at least in public. But ""Old Europe"" also seems less and less inclined to try to lend a helping hand. As a result, the transatlantic rift that opened up because of Iraq shows little sign of healing. On the contrary, it may widen.
As recently as a couple of months ago, it seemed that even France and Germany might eventually be persuaded to play some positive role in Iraq. But as the security situation has deteriorated, the notion that more European countries might be persuaded to commit troops to Iraq--perhaps under NATO or the UN--has lost plausibility. The struggle now is to persuade those already there, like the Italians and Poles, not to follow the Spanish and pull out. Philip Gordon of America's Brookings Institution, who has just co-authored a study of the diplomatic crisis over Iraq (""Allies at War"", published by McGraw-Hill) says: ""Until a couple of months ago, I was optimistic that Europe and America could put this behind us."" But he is now ""deeply pessimistic"" about the chances of a new transatlantic accord over Iraq, at least until after the American presidential election. 
A well-placed EU diplomat agrees. He argues that almost everybody thinks that the Americans are now looking for a way out. ""People don't want to be associated with something that looks much more likely to be a failure than a success. There is also a suspicion that it may anyway be too late for the mantle of internationalism to have any effect on the ground in Iraq.""
The day-to-day situation in Iraq itself is sufficiently alarming for worries about the long-term future of the transatlantic alliance to seem a little abstract. But on a range of issues--terrorism, trade, Palestine, China--co-operation and agreement between the United States and Europe still matters hugely. The concern now is that the Iraqi mess will embolden those in Europe who want to portray America as a dangerous, immoral power that needs countering. Already, European politicians have won elections by running against the American government. Gerhard Schroder blazed the trail when he came from behind to win the German election of September 2002 by attacking the Bush administration over Iraq. Jose Lus Rodriguez Zapatero repeated the trick in Spain, campaigning against the ""illegal and unjust war"" in Iraq--and gaining an unexpected victory after the Madrid bombing of March 11th made his arguments seem more attractive to Spanish voters.
When Bush-bashing pays
Now Romano Prodi, who shamelessly combines the role of head of the European Commission with that of leader of Italy's left, is trying the same tactic. This week election posters went up in Italy, featuring a smiling Prodi next to the slogan: ""Iraq, a mistaken war"". Those who hoped the Madrid bombing would convince Europeans they are part of the same ""war on terror"" as America have been disappointed. On the contrary, one prominent member of the European Commission sums up the conventional wisdom as follows: ""Because of the Iraq war, the threat of terrorism is now ten times worse than when Saddam was in power."" As Bill Drozdiak, head of the Brussels-based Transatlantic Centre, sees it: ""Europeans see the biggest threat to their security as Americans dragging them into a foreign war.""
As the possibility of serious European engagement in Iraq recedes, so it becomes easier for European politicians to retreat into sloganising about Iraq: calling for the withdrawal of troops, a UN presence and a sovereign Iraqi government--while gliding over the tiresome details of just how all this might be achieved. If ""old Europe"" has a policy on Iraq now, it is to pray for a Kerry victory in November. But they may be disappointed even if their prayers are answered. Charles Kupchan of America's Council on Foreign Relations argues that while ""Europeans are hoping that a Kerry administration would execute a 180-degree turn on foreign policy, it's more likely to be a 20% adjustment."" Mr Kerry was swift to condemn the withdrawal of Spanish troops from Iraq. And he is unlikely to endorse two other key elements of old European conventional wisdom--the notions that a Middle East peace deal is there for the taking, if only America would put pressure on Israel; and that American military action can be legitimate only if it receives the prior approval of the UN.
Such disagreements suggest the estrangement between much of Europe and the United States goes well beyond Iraq and the policies of the Bush administration. Mr Kupchan has just directed a Council on Foreign Relations report on ""Renewing the Atlantic Partnership"", which features the distilled wisdom of luminaries such as Henry Kissinger and Lawrence Summers, the president of Harvard. It makes some ho-hum recommendations about the need for Europeans and Americans to ""make an effort to achieve a common position"" on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and ""to agree on the role of multilateral institutions"". And it ends on a note of obligatory optimism about the possibility of ""enlightened leadership"", restoring the Atlantic partnership. Yet the report also considers a darker scenario: ""If Europe defines its identity in terms of countering U.S. power, the world is likely to return to a balance-of-power system reminiscent of the era prior to World War I--with the same disastrous consequences.""
The idea that Europe and America might actually come into armed conflict still seems absurd. But the notion that Europeans and Americans may increasingly be rivals rather than partners seems less implausible than it once did.",230,Spain,"Old Europe views the Iraqi mess with growing detachment
""WE SEE Iraq as a very complex country, with many different ethnic groups, a tradition of violence, and no experience of democracy. You can't create democracy with bombs."" So wrote Jean-David Levitte, the French ambassador to the United States in the New York Times in February 2003, justifying his country's opposition to the impending American invasion of Iraq. As the United States sinks deeper into trouble in Iraq, the European countries that opposed the war are resisting the temptation to gloat--at least in public. But ""Old Europe"" also seems less and less inclined to try to lend a helping hand. As a result, the transatlantic rift that opened up because of Iraq shows little sign of healing. On the contrary, it may widen.
As recently as a couple of months ago, it seemed that even France and Germany might eventually be persuaded to play some positive role in Iraq. But as the security situation has deteriorated, the notion that more European countries might be persuaded to commit troops to Iraq--perhaps under NATO or the UN--has lost plausibility. The struggle now is to persuade those already there, like the Italians and Poles, not to follow the Spanish and pull out. Philip Gordon of America's Brookings Institution, who has just co-authored a study of the diplomatic crisis over Iraq (""Allies at War"", published by McGraw-Hill) says: ""Until a couple of months ago, I was optimistic that Europe and America could put this behind us."" But he is now ""deeply pessimistic"" about the chances of a new transatlantic accord over Iraq, at least until after the American presidential election. 
A well-placed EU diplomat agrees. He argues that almost everybody thinks that the Americans are now looking for a way out. ""People don't want to be associated with something that looks much more likely to be a failure than a success. There is also a suspicion that it may anyway be too late for the mantle of internationalism to have any effect on the ground in Iraq.""

AFTER his surprise win in March's election, Spain's new prime minister, Jose Luis Rodrguez Zapatero, announced that he would withdraw Spanish troops from Iraq as soon as possible. This week the last Spanish soldier duly came home. Two-thirds of Spaniards backed the withdrawal; Mr Zapatero's ratings have soared. Opinion polls suggest that his Socialist Party is running 9-14 points ahead of the opposition People's Party in the European elections on June 13th. He is also winning support for social progressivism.
Indeed, after eight years of the confrontational style of Jose Mara Aznar's government, the more congenial Mr Zapatero is in a state of grace. In marked contrast to the Castilian dogmatism of Mr Aznar, he has set out an unabashedly politically correct, secular platform, to reflect the diversity of modern Spain. For example, in his first parliamentary speech after the election, he promised to make equality between the sexes an ""emblematic task"". His first move was to appoint eight women to his 16-strong cabinet, putting Spain on a par with Sweden for ministerial sex equality. The most powerful is Mara Teresa Fernndez de la Vega, the first vice-president. A few still complained that the macho jobs such as defence, the economy and the interior went to the boys.
In another sign of commitment to sex parity, Mr Zapatero has pledged to reform the electoral system to ensure that the same number of women as men stand as candidates in elections. He has also outlined plans to legalise same-sex marriages and to give gay couples the right to adopt children. ""Homosexuals and trans-sexuals deserve the same treatment as heterosexuals, and have the right to live freely the lives that they have chosen,"" he declared.
Mr Zapatero even plans to change the Spanish laws of succession, ending male primogeniture, so that a woman may succeed to the Spanish throne. This reform, which appears to have the royal nod, will not be retrospective, so it will not affect Crown Prince Felipe, who has two older sisters. The prince was married in Madrid on May 22nd, in a suitably sombre ceremony, to a former television news presenter and divorcee, Letizia Ortiz. In keeping with the mood of the times, the wedding was criticised by some for failing to represent religions other than Roman Catholicism, and by others for shamelessly breaking with traditional practice by omitting holy communion.
Much to the chagrin of the Catholic church and many in the People's Party, Mr Zapatero has promised also to liberalise the country's tough abortion laws, and to change the law on the use of human embryos, in both cases bringing Spain more into line with the rest of Europe. And he has suspended Mr Aznar's legislation that made religious education obligatory, prompting the Bishop of Segorbe-Castelln to call those who back the move barbarians. In regions where the People's Party still holds power, such as Madrid, religious classes will remain obligatory.
Most of these socially progressive measures have been welcomed by the young who were prominent among the estimated 1.6m voters who switched to Mr Zapatero in March--hence his continuing popularity. But he may struggle to keep up the momentum. Since he did not expect to win the election, he came to office with some grand, airy and potentially expensive promises. He has, for instance, scrapped Mr Aznar's National Hydrology Plan, under which water was to be diverted from the River Ebro to the parched south, but without suggesting an alternative. He has put in place plans to unify Spain's bewildering array of mutually suspicious intelligence and security services and promised to employ 36,000 more policemen over the next four years. The government has already modified its pledge to build 180,000 houses at ""accessible"" prices. But it still plans to raise the minimum wage in July, from euro460 ($560) a month to euro490, and it wants to push it to euro600 by the end of the legislature. 
Mr Zapatero's biggest challenge will be Spain's autonomous regions, which want more powers. One gesture he has made is to promise to reform the Senate, which has been an impotent arm of the Cortes, so that it represents the 17 regions. In general, Mr Zapatero has promised to respect the constitution and seek ""approval by majorities that represent an ample political and social consensus."" This week, he held a first meeting with the People's Party leader, Mariano Rajoy, in an attempt to find common ground. He will now meet the Basque and Catalan nationalist leaders as well. For all his passion for pacts, consensus and dialogue, he may find that it will not be long before some petulant fists start banging the negotiating table.

2004-06-19,https://www-proquest-com.proxy.uchicago.edu/abicomplete/docview/224006718/fulltext/3CCB57656FA049F5PQ/1?accountid=14657,"After 30 years of economic and political success, Spain is entering a new phase of democratic development, says John Grimond
IT IS difficult not to like Spain, not to enjoy the atmosphere of such a civilised society and not to admire the achievements of its people. In under 30 years--Generalisimo Francisco Franco died in November 1975--Spain has emerged from dictatorship and international isolation, built a successful economy and established an effective democracy. Perhaps no other European country has achieved so much, on so many fronts, so quickly.
Yet Spain is also slightly ill-at-ease, slightly lacking in self-confidence. That was true even before the terrorists' bombs of March 11th that shook Spaniards to their bones, and the ruling People's Party of Jose Mara Aznar from the seat of government that it thought it had a lock on for another four years. Things were not altogether composed even then, and they are certainly more complicated now.
Much of what Spain has achieved is real enough. In less than a generation the country has established a democratic system in which parties alternate in government, and governments, on the whole, deliver the goods. Of course, the evolution has had some bumps: an attempted military coup in 1981, for instance, boldly squelched by King Juan Carlos, and a scandal during the Socialist administration of Felipe Gonzlez in the mid-1990s about the use of death-squads against Basque terrorists. In both episodes the issue at stake was really the rule of law. 
Nonetheless, all in all, Spain has developed not just a firm democracy but a system of governments that produce policies and implement them--in other words, they govern. Most notably, they deliver economic growth, which is why Spaniards are today about 75% richer than they were 30 years ago, and have seen their economy grow faster than the European average for nearly ten years.
Not surprisingly, democratic Spain has won the respect of other countries. Some have attributed this to the assertive leadership of Mr Aznar, who loosened Spain's ties with France and Germany, strengthened those with Euro-equivocal Britain and the uncompromising United States of George Bush, and brooked no nonsense from countries such as Morocco when they provoked him. After years on the fringes of international respectability, Spain has certainly started to count in the world. Mr Aznar saw the significance of this, yet the respect given to his country beyond its borders derived not so much from his strutting on the world stage as from the fact that Spain had become a country that worked. It was a place to be reckoned with.
The contrast with Italy is instructive. Italy has been a democracy for about twice as long as Spain. It is richer and its population, at 59m, is nearly half as large again as Spain's, at 40m. Under Silvio Berlusconi, Italy, like Spain, has even aligned itself with Mr Bush's America and sent troops at his behest to Iraq. But how influential is Italy? Mr Berlusconi could hardly match Mr Aznar's 14 meetings with Mr Bush in 2002-04. He was not even invited to join Mr Aznar, Mr Blair and Portugal's Jose Manuel Duro Barroso at Mr Bush's summit in the Azores before the Iraq war in March 2003. Yet if Italy has been punching below its weight and Spain above it, that is not because Mr Bush found Spain's prime minister ideologically more congenial than Italy's. It is because Spain is a serious country.
Not too serious, fortunately. For those who seek trendy tapas bars, non-stop night life or inventive restaurants, Spain is the place. Good Spanish wine no longer comes only from La Rioja, any more than good Spanish cheese comes only from La Mancha. Spanish athletes excel on the golf course, the football pitch and the tennis court. Spain's singers have long been bringing down the world's opera houses. Now its dancers, such as Tamar Rojo, who performs with Britain's Royal Ballet, are entrancing international audiences, its actresses, such as Elena Anaya, are conquering Hollywood, and its directors, such as Pedro Almodvar, are beguiling Cannes. 
The cultural exuberance is even more conspicuous in architecture, Spanish-commissioned if not all Spanish-designed. The Agbar tower, a huge new skyscraper that has recently broken the Barcelona skyline, is just one of the many striking buildings going up across Spain in this burst of architectural fecundity. The trend was started by the citizens of the old industrial city of Bilbao, who were clever enough in the 1990s to persuade a first-rate American architect, Frank Gehry, to design them their own Guggenheim Museum (a spectacular titanium-clad clipper that now stands on the site of an old shipyard), and to get the Basque government to pay for it. Next they asked Spain's own Santiago Calatrava to design the city's stylish Sondika airport. Then they got Britain's Norman Foster to do their metro--whose stations are now known as fosteritos. Bilbao, once mouldering and mephitic, has never looked back.
Other cities are following suit. Barcelona has taken on Zaha Hadid, the Anglo-Iraqi winner of the 2004 Pritzker architecural prize, to design a Plaza de las Artes. She is also overseeing the development of another swathe of Bilbao, as well as designing a large building in Durango. Crdoba has asked the Netherlands' Rem Koolhas to plan its own urban project. Valencia has signed up Mr Calatrava to create a City of Arts and Sciences. And Madrid, not content with commissioning Britain's Richard Rogers to help finish its expanded Barajas airport, is undertaking five projects costing over euro150m ($180m) that will together form a new cultural area to be known as the Saln del Prado. 
The fiesta factor
Spain's cities have, for over a decade, been clever at promoting themselves, and thus the country as a whole, through international fiestas. Barcelona got a huge lift from the Olympics in 1992, and so did Seville from the Expo world fair that same year. Now Barcelona is holding a euro326m jamboree called Forum 2004. In 2007 Valencia will hold, on behalf of the landlocked Swiss champions, the contest for sailing's oldest competition, the America's Cup. And Madrid is now running second in the stakes to hold the 2012 Olympics.
All this gives Spain the feeling of a place with a spring in its step. It undoubtedly helps to draw visitors and to make Spaniards feel they live in a modern, culturally vital society. Yet it also helps to show up those parts of Spanish existence that have not quite caught up with the times.
Evidence of such underdevelopment can be found in most areas of Spanish life. Spanish business, for example, is remarkably timid, deferential towards government and, with a few exceptions such as the clothing company Zara and the stainless-steel maker Acerinox, reluctant to venture beyond the Spanish-speaking world, even into Europe. Spain has few big international companies. The main ones are former state-owned giants that have been privatised--and whose boards were then packed by the government. Even companies that have no formal government connection often seek political approval for board appointments. The recent change of government has prompted many changes in corporate Spain.
Such upheavals are not confined to business. All sorts of institutions that in other countries might be independent--think-tanks, the judiciary, the country's main institute for projecting national culture abroad and the media, notably the state broadcasting system--have seen heads roll since the general election on March 14th, just as they have rolled after previous general elections. The practice reflects the relative youth of Spanish democracy: it has not had time to develop the dense undergrowth of independent organisations that enrich older democracies--a non-partisan press, forthright professional associations, self-confident universities, sceptical non-government bodies, outspoken individuals and so on.
Spain also lags in some social areas such as homosexual rights and the role of women. Domestic violence is a big problem--no more so than elsewhere, but perhaps less recognised until recently. The Catholic church still receives much of its income through a share of Spaniards' income tax, albeit only by individual agreement. These and other matters will come up for review, and indeed the new government is already tackling many of them. 
Two other problems--immigration and regionalism--are of a different nature: they are not directly connected with the growing pains of an adolescent democracy, but they may prove much harder to deal with. A country of emigrants has rather quickly turned into one of immigrants, some of whom may prove difficult to absorb. And a country that has already devolved more power from its centre than any other in Europe cannot quite understand why many of its citizens are still not satisfied, whereas others think it has already done too much. A large proportion of Spaniards, it seems, want to live in a plural state of several nationalities, whereas another large proportion see their country as a unitary state infested by tiresome regional romantics.
All this adds up to a country more tentative and less self-assured than it appears. Four months ago Spain seemed ready to accept the stern rule of Mr Aznar, with his Atlanticist foreign policy, traditional approach to social issues and unbending attitude towards Basque, Catalan and other nationalists. A moment later the self-same place appeared to be rejoicing at a new government's snubbing of the Americans, its support for left-wing causes and its new spirit of conciliation towards the regions. Could a country capable of such a rapid swing be anything but a bit confused?
Fickle affections
In truth, Spain was never quite as self-assured as it seemed, nor quite as in love with Mr Aznar as foreigners imagined--even if some of those who now affect to despise the former tax inspector with great-power pretensions were quite ready to vote for him a few months ago. It is likely, however, that this year's dramatic election will come to be seen not as a by-product of a terrorist attack that happened to lead to a change of government, but as the natural end of the first era of Spain's post-Franco transition to democracy. What follows now is a second era--a transition from a simple democracy to a more complicated, more sophisticated one. 
The new government under Jose Luis Rodrguez Zapatero certainly has the opportunity to launch this second transition. It has lost no time in bringing Spain's troops back from Iraq, in proffering an open hand to Spain's traditional partners in Europe and in embarking on a programme of social change, all the while promising to stick to the old certainties of sound financial housekeeping, and dialogue and consensus all round. 
Popular as this is at present, it may not be adequate to meet the realities of Spain's new circumstances: a richer country whose citizens must now find higher-earning and more productive jobs than the unskilled ones of the past; a more diverse society which now includes multitudes of North Africans and Latin Americans; and an internally strained society that has to manage the different ambitions of its constituent peoples--Basques, Catalans, Galicians and the rest--within a tolerant, sophisticated democracy. Mr Zapatero has his chance to start shaping the new Spain.

Valencia has signed up Mr Calatrava to create a City of Arts and Sciences. And Madrid, not content with commissioning Britain's Richard Rogers to help finish its expanded Barajas airport, is undertaking five projects costing over euro150m ($180m) that will together form a new cultural area to be known as the Saln del Prado. 
The fiesta factor
Spain's cities have, for over a decade, been clever at promoting themselves, and thus the country as a whole, through international fiestas. Barcelona got a huge lift from the Olympics in 1992, and so did Seville from the Expo world fair that same year. Now Barcelona is holding a euro326m jamboree called Forum 2004. In 2007 Valencia will hold, on behalf of the landlocked Swiss champions, the contest for sailing's oldest competition, the America's Cup. And Madrid is now running second in the stakes to hold the 2012 Olympics.
All this gives Spain the feeling of a place with a spring in its step. It undoubtedly helps to draw visitors and to make Spaniards feel they live in a modern, culturally vital society. Yet it also helps to show up those parts of Spanish existence that have not quite caught up with the times.
Evidence of such underdevelopment can be found in most areas of Spanish life. Spanish business, for example, is remarkably timid, deferential towards government and, with a few exceptions such as the clothing company Zara and the stainless-steel maker Acerinox, reluctant to venture beyond the Spanish-speaking world, even into Europe. Spain has few big international companies. The main ones are former state-owned giants that have been privatised--and whose boards were then packed by the government. Even companies that have no formal government connection often seek political approval for board appointments. The recent change of government has prompted many changes in corporate Spain.
Such upheavals are not confined to business. All sorts of institutions that in other countries might be independent--think-tanks, the judiciary, the country's main institute for projecting national culture abroad and the media, notably the state broadcasting system--have seen heads roll since the general election on March 14th, just as they have rolled after previous general elections. The practice reflects the relative youth of Spanish democracy: it has not had time to develop the dense undergrowth of independent organisations that enrich older democracies--a non-partisan press, forthright professional associations, self-confident universities, sceptical non-government bodies, outspoken individuals and so on.
Spain also lags in some social areas such as homosexual rights and the role of women. Domestic violence is a big problem--no more so than elsewhere, but perhaps less recognised until recently. The Catholic church still receives much of its income through a share of Spaniards' income tax, albeit only by individual agreement. These and other matters will come up for review, and indeed the new government is already tackling many of them. 
Two other problems--immigration and regionalism--are of a different nature: they are not directly connected with the growing pains of an adolescent democracy, but they may prove much harder to deal with. A country of emigrants has rather quickly turned into one of immigrants, some of whom may prove difficult to absorb. And a country that has already devolved more power from its centre than any other in Europe cannot quite understand why many of its citizens are still not satisfied, whereas others think it has already done too much. A large proportion of Spaniards, it seems, want to live in a plural state of several nationalities, whereas another large proportion see their country as a unitary state infested by tiresome regional romantics.
All this adds up to a country more tentative and less self-assured than it appears. Four months ago Spain seemed ready to accept the stern rule of Mr Aznar, with his Atlanticist foreign policy, traditional approach to social issues and unbending attitude towards Basque, Catalan and other nationalists. A moment later the self-same place appeared to be rejoicing at a new government's snubbing of the Americans, its support for left-wing causes and its new spirit of conciliation towards the regions. Could a country capable of such a rapid swing be anything but a bit confused?
Fickle affections
In truth, Spain was never quite as self-assured as it seemed, nor quite as in love with Mr Aznar as foreigners imagined--even if some of those who now affect to despise the former tax inspector with great-power pretensions were quite ready to vote for him a few months ago. It is likely, however, that this year's dramatic election will come to be seen not as a by-product of a terrorist attack that happened to lead to a change of government, but as the natural end of the first era of Spain's post-Franco transition to democracy. What follows now is a second era--a transition from a simple democracy to a more complicated, more sophisticated one. 
The new government under Jose Luis Rodrguez Zapatero certainly has the opportunity to launch this second transition. It has lost no time in bringing Spain's troops back from Iraq, in proffering an open hand to Spain's traditional partners in Europe and in embarking on a programme of social change, all the while promising to stick to the old certainties of sound financial housekeeping, and dialogue and consensus all round. 
Popular as this is at present, it may not be adequate to meet the realities of Spain's new circumstances: a richer country whose citizens must now find higher-earning and more productive jobs than the unskilled ones of the past; a more diverse society which now includes multitudes of North Africans and Latin Americans; and an internally strained society that has to manage the different ambitions of its constituent peoples--Basques, Catalans, Galicians and the rest--within a tolerant, sophisticated democracy. Mr Zapatero has his chance to start shaping the new Spain. What are his prospects of success?",True

SELDOM has hagiography turned so swiftly to reproach. Well before March 14th, the date that Mr Aznar himself had chosen for his departure from Spanish politics, the encomiums were pouring forth. Not only had he given Spain eight years of economic growth (an average of 3.2% a year), sound management of the public purse (no budget deficits like those of France, Germany and Italy), lowish inflation (2.6% in 2003) and a cut in the unemployment rate from 22% to 11%, but he had also had the resolve to beat back ETA (about 200 arrests in 2003, including those in France, and only three killings) and take Spain into the front line of Mr Bush's war against terror in Afghanistan and Iraq.
The voters did not care for all of it: 90% of Spaniards, in poll after poll, said they opposed the war in Iraq and Spain's part in it. But, since most of them also told the pollsters that they would vote for Mr Aznar's party under his chosen successor, Mariano Rajoy, they seemed to be implicitly acknowledging that they admired his leadership, and perhaps also his readiness to take them even where they did not want to go. That, however, proved to be a grave misreading of the voters' views.
In what is still a fairly conservative country, it is striking how few people now have good things to say about Mr Aznar. Forgotten, largely, are the achievements of his first term, when he presided over the continued devolution of power to the regions--admittedly driven by his government's dependence on regional parties in parliament. Forgotten, too, or taken for granted, are the decency and effectiveness with which he mostly governed (notably, again, in his first term), and which were in marked contrast to the sleaze at the end of the Socialists' previous period of office.
Not least among his achievements was to turn the People's Party (PP), often seen as Francoist in its sympathies, into a respectable centre-right organisation. All this is eclipsed, if only temporarily. Instead, the failings of the second Aznar term are now remembered, most of which come under the headings of rigidity and arrogance.
Top of the list, of course, is the attempted manipulation of public opinion in the period between the bombs of March 11th and the election of March 14th--the attempt to place the blame on ETA, the telephone calls to the media assuring them of ETA's guilt, the foreign minister's request for a specific condemnation of ETA in a UN resolution of sympathy, the state television's decision to drop an evening showing of ""Shakespeare in Love"" and run instead a documentary on the evils of ETA, and so on. This attempt at superspin--largely exposed by text-messaging on mobile phones--so infuriated a large group of Spaniards, most of them young, many of them too disillusioned with party politics to want to cast their ballots at all, that they went out and voted Socialist in disgust.
Mr Aznar is to this day uncontrite, conceding only that ""perhaps Spanish public opinion was not sufficiently aware, until March 11th, of the extent of Islamic terrorism"". He telephoned Mr Bush to express his regret about his successor's decision to withdraw Spain's troops from Iraq. Some in his party believe the election was stolen from them. Most others put the episode down to simple hubris. 
Mr Aznar's arrogance certainly had costs beyond his party's loss of the election in March. Coupled with his inflexibility, it needlessly antagonised all sorts of people who might have worked with him. The general hostility to Spain's Iraqi venture would surely have been less intense had the prime minister been ready to explain his reasons for it to the electorate. 
As it was, he would not even go before parliament at the outset and make his case for sending troops to Iraq. Instead he merely asserted that it was good for Spain, and then grudgingly allowed a secret parliamentary vote, in which the entire PP was evidently whipped into line. It was only last December, eight months after the war began, that Mr Aznar addressed parliament about Iraq, on a day of mourning for seven intelligence officers just killed.
The alienation from Spain's partners in Europe could also have been tempered by a more diplomatic approach. Mr Aznar was right in seeing that Spain had an interest in good relations with both North and South America, but these could have been achieved without antagonising two of its neighbours, France and Morocco, and a potentially useful friend like Germany.
His decision last December to oppose, with Poland, any change to the majority-voting provision of the European Union's Nice treaty was even less defensible: the treaty, stitched up in haste in December 2000, gave Spain and Poland almost the same number of votes as much more populous Britain, France, Germany and Italy, and the system clearly needed to be changed if the enlarged EU were not to be immobilised for ever. The refusal of the Spanish and Polish governments to compromise led to an impasse over the proposed EU constitution, which was therefore in limbo when the Union took in ten new members on May 1st.
A similar obtuseness latterly marked Mr Aznar's relations with most of Spain's nationalists. Perhaps influenced by his dislike of ETA--which very nearly killed him, in a bomb attack in 1995--he outlawed Batasuna, ETA's political wing, in 2002, depriving the state of a possible interlocutor with the terrorists. He also became less and less tolerant of other nationalists. Indeed, he grew increasingly prone to bracketing together all Basque nationalists, whether pro-violence or anti-violence, and refused to talk to the Basque premier, Juan Jose Ibarretxe, from 2001 on, even though Mr Ibarretxe's non-violent party had shown itself in successive elections to be the Basque region's most popular.
Many Basque nationalists are rather conservative--natural allies, it might be thought, of Mr Aznar's PP. Catalonia's nationalists in the Convergence and Union (CiU) party are even more natural partners, and indeed kept Mr Aznar's party in office during his first term. But once that necessity disappeared, so did any affection between the two. Mr Aznar increasingly seemed to regard all nationalist demands as equally outrageous, no matter who made them, and not surprisingly his party was fiercely punished in Catalonia's regional election last November. The CiU, equally unsurprisingly, is now grouped in the European Parliament with the other mainstream nationalists.
The Spanish electorate might well have forgiven the PP for some of the shortcomings of its outgoing leader, such as his handling of the wreck of the Prestige, a tanker that polluted a long stretch of the Atlantic coast in 2002, or the misjudgments that led to a general strike that same year. Strangely, Mr Aznar's more trivial foibles seem to have caused greater annoyance: his delight in putting his feet up on a table and smoking a cigar with Mr Bush at a G8 summit in Canada, for instance; even such folies de grandeur as holding a flamboyant wedding for his daughter in the Escorial monastery, near Madrid, where Spain's monarchs are traditionally buried.
Yet these too could all have been overlooked. His economic record, his success in weakening ETA and his impending departure could have been enough to ensure a victory for the PP under Mr Rajoy. But in the event he was undone by his response to the bombings, and so was his party. 
The voters' revenge
Mr Zapatero's Socialists have been the main beneficiaries. The ""certain"" losers of the March election suddenly found themselves victors, and the poll for the European Parliament on June 13th suggests that their popularity has not diminished since. This in itself is evidence that the vote was not a passing reaction to the Madrid bombings that killed 191 people and injured 1,430. Still less was it a capitulation to terrorism, or any sort of attempt to appease Muslim attackers. Spain has lived with terror for over 30 years, during which more than 800 people have been killed by ETA. Throughout this time the Spaniards have shown no inclination to yield. 
On the contrary, they have taken to the streets in throngs to express their disgust with the perpetrators of terror and their sympathy for the victims--notably on March 12th, when 11m people, over a quarter of the population, joined dignified demonstrations in cities across Spain. As William Chislett, of the Elcano Royal Institute, has pointed out, had ETA taken responsibility for the bombings, the PP would certainly have been returned with another absolute majority. As it was, the incoming Socialists quickly rededicated themselves to fighting terrorism, an aim to which they were already pledged in a formal anti-terrorist pact signed with the PP in 2000. 
The Socialists came to office as surprised as everyone else that they were there (though Mr Zapatero protests otherwise), and utterly unprepared. Worse, they were encumbered with an election manifesto written in the belief that it would not have to be implemented and so promising a host of reforms that no prudent finance minister would want to pay for. Even so, the voters would surely have forgiven them if they had then explained that unforeseen circumstances made it impossible for them to do all that they had vowed.
So why was Mr Zapatero's first act to say that he would pull Spain's 1,300 troops out of Iraq? This, if anything, was an election commitment that could have been reconsidered in the light of the bloodiest terrorist attack in Europe since Lockerbie in 1988. And the case for reconsideration was strong. Though the withdrawal was genuinely an acknowledgment of the desires of a great majority of Spaniards, it was capable of being construed as a victory for terrorism. Mr Zapatero had himself once said that Spain's alignment with America had put it on the target list for international terrorists. So might this decision not have been seen as an attempt to get off that list?
Appeasement was certainly how many Americans would see it--Donald Rumsfeld is said to have also called it an act of cowardice--and possibly how al-Qaeda and its sympathisers would too. The withdrawal could at least have been postponed, but instead it was accelerated as Mr Zapatero quickly abandoned his initial condition: that it would happen only if the UN had not taken control of Iraq by June 30th. Instead, the new prime minister thumbed his nose at America and appeared to concede to terror as needlessly, it might be said, as Mr Aznar had so often needlessly annoyed those he disliked.
It could equally be said, in Mr Zapatero's defence, that he had not intended to withdraw Spain's troops so precipitately until it became clear, first, that no UN handover was in prospect and, next, that the troops were being asked not to help in stabilisation and reconstruction, as understood in the original mandate, but to take part in ""an offensive strategy"" against Muqtada al-Sadr in Najaf. Mr Zapatero was always at pains to point out that Spain had 3,000 peacekeeping troops elsewhere, and was ready to strengthen its force in Afghanistan. And he has recently been much more restrained about Mr Bush's policies. 
Keeping a promise
No doubt Mr Zapatero also wanted to avoid the experience of one of his predecessors, Mr Gonzlez, who was re-elected in 1986 vowing to take Spain out of NATO but soon reversed himself and ended up, after a referendum, cementing its membership. Yet perhaps the most decisive consideration throughout for Mr Zapatero was the cries of ""Don't fail us!"" rising from the crowds of young voters in Madrid after the election. The promise to bring the troops home had been made by the Socialists over and over again for a year. Mr Zapatero evidently minded more about his bond with the voters, especially the 2m voting for the first time, than about anything else. 
That, however, hardly explains the other surprise of Mr Zapatero's first post-election utterances: his readiness to make concessions over Spain's EU voting rights. The Socialists had always accepted the double-majority system that the PP jibbed at, and their pro-EU sympathies were well known. But to promise concessions without getting anything in return--nothing of consequence was, in the event, forthcoming--looked like foolishness or, to be charitable, inexperience. 
Perhaps it was. Mr Zapatero has some old hands in his government, including the canny Pedro Solbes as economy minister, not even a member of the Socialist Party and just the man to reassure the financial markets. But the 43-year-old prime minister himself, whose youthful appearance has earned him the nicknames of Bambi and Babyface, is a novice. He will just have to learn on the job. It should not prove impossible for a man who was chosen as leader of his party chiefly because he was a moderniser, and who, by even his opponents' accounts, fought an effective election campaign.

UNPREPARED the Socialists may have been, but that has not stopped them announcing a stream of policies on everything from abortion to water. The more difficult domestic issues, however, can wait. Foreign affairs are different: Iraq was from day one too big to ignore, and the EU has a calendar of summits and budgets that demands attention. Spain must very soon decide whether its interests lie primarily in continental Europe, as the Socialists say, or across the Atlantic to the west, whither Mr Aznar yanked his country's foreign policy.
In fact Morocco, to Spain's south, is the first country that Mr Zapatero has visited as prime minister, taking the sensible view that Spain should be on good terms with a neighbour just 13km (eight miles) away. Similar thoughts have occurred to Spanish leaders before, but relations between the ex-colonial master and its part-protege--most of the country used to be French--have been strained for years. The Moroccans resent the continued existence of two Spanish enclaves, Ceuta and Melilla, on their northern coast. They also bridle at the periodic support given by Spaniards to the Polisario Front that seeks independence for Western (formerly Spanish) Sahara. 
For their part, the Spaniards resent Morocco's claims not just on the two enclaves but on various islets, one of which, Parsley island, it invaded two years ago in a comic incident that had to be defused by Colin Powell, America's secretary of state. In addition, Spain would like to see Morocco reduce the numbers of migrants who cross the Strait of Gibraltar--a desire reinforced by the belief that most of the bombers on March 11th were Moroccan. 
Unfortunately, it is hard to see how any of these problems can be easily settled. If Morocco is not quite an absolute monarchy, it is certainly not a democracy and, despite some recent reforms, it is not about to give independence to Western Sahara. For its part, Spain will not yield up Ceuta and Melilla. There is scope for better co-operation on terrorism and perhaps on migration, but Morocco has no magic answers: suicide bombers killed 33 bystanders in Casablanca in May 2003, and the flow of migrants will not cease until Morocco's living standards approach Spain's. 
That will not happen for years, even though Spain could do more to hasten the day. It could, for example, give Morocco more aid. Much more useful, though, would be a decision to abandon the practice of growing (with Moroccan labour) expensively irrigated vegetables and cotton in the arid south of Spain, and instead to import these crops from Morocco. Mr Zapatero has had the good sense to cancel a controversial plan to take water from the River Ebro in northern Spain down to the vegetable farms and golf courses of the parched south. But Spain's uneconomic farming practices will not end without a thorough reform of the EU's common agricultural policy, which Spanish farmers, and their governments (including the new one), stoutly resist. 
In fact, most solutions to Spain's Moroccan problems, if solutions exist, have an EU component. The EU would not condemn the invasion of Parsley island because France, which sees itself as a rival to Spain in their former colony, vetoed it. Terror, migration, farming and fishing (another source of tension) all demand joint European as much as bilateral action.
Mr Zapatero would be the first to admit this, but will he also come to see that Mr Aznar's attitude, flinty as it certainly was, also had some merit to it? Mr Aznar's success in getting Spain a disproportionate number of votes in EU decision-making was, for instance, some compensation for the fact that Spain stands to lose in several ways from the expansion of the EU.
First, Spain almost certainly moves from being the biggest net beneficiary of the EU's regional funds--to the tune of euro8.4 billion in 2002--to being a net contributor. Second, now that a clutch of much poorer countries have joined the club, Spain is no longer the low-wage economy of choice for foreign investors wanting to set up in the EU. That partly reflects Spain's economic success--income per person is now 87% of the average for the EU-15, compared with 74% when it joined in 1986--but the general drift of manufacturing jobs to eastern Europe that has taken place in recent months is likely to continue. Third, the EU's centre of political gravity has moved eastwards and away from the Mediterranean south. Even though several of the new members are Atlanticist in outlook, Spain has become more peripheral.
The Spaniards like the EU. They associate it no doubt with their new prosperity and with Spain's return to the family of nations after nearly 40 years of semi-isolation. All opinion polls confirm its popularity. But Spanish business is also drawn west, to Latin America (where Spain has $87 billion invested, and which contributes 7% of its listed companies' earnings), and Mr Aznar was not alone in seeing a great role for Spain as the leader of an increasingly influential Spanish-speaking community abroad. There was some wishful thinking in this, but it is true that 350m people speak Spanish in Latin America, as do 30m in the United States. Indeed, Spanish has become much the most popular second language in the United States.
Mr Aznar saw more than this. He saw the merits of aligning Spain with an economically liberal Britain, which also had strong transatlantic links. And he wanted to tie his war on ETA, which was to some extent obsessive, almost personal, into Mr Bush's global war on terror.
Lastly, there was an unspoken recognition that Spain, even more than some other European countries, needed America's security umbrella. In many respects the Spaniards are deeply pacifist: though they backed membership of NATO in a referendum in 1986 and opinion polls showed they supported the war in Kosovo, similar polls suggest they would not want to see Spain fight even to defend Ceuta and Melilla. Much has been made of Spain's contingent in Iraq, but in truth it was purely symbolic. Spain spent just 1.2% of its GDP on defence in 2002, compared with an average of 1.9% for NATO's European members and of 2.6% for NATO as a whole. If Spain were threatened, it would turn not to the EU's would-be security system but to the United States.
All this suggests there could be pitfalls for Mr Zapatero if he were thought to be too accommodating in negotiations with the EU over, for instance, the budget; or if his clear dislike of Mr Bush's Middle East policies poisoned transatlantic relations (perhaps only for a while--he has already ""aligned"" himself with John Kerry). 
Fortunately, his foreign minister, Miguel ngel Moratinos, is a former diplomat with wide experience, albeit chiefly of the Arab world, not the United States. And the defence minister, Jose Bono Martnez, is no left-wing ideologue. Rather, he is the most conservative member of the government, if not always the most tactful. In any event these two may help to smooth relations with the Americans, particularly if they can keep the new government's promise to strengthen the diplomatic service, which has long been underfinanced and overpoliticised.
Going ape over a rock
Therein lies another opportunity for Mr Zapatero, if he wants to take it. One problem above all others occupies an utterly disproportionate amount of time in Spain's small and often overstretched foreign ministry. It is Gibraltar, the rocky promontory ceded to Britain under the Treaty of Utrecht in 1713. Spain considers it outrageous that Britain should still have a ""colony"" in Europe, and wages an intermittent guerrilla war of some pettiness against Gibraltar, recently banning liners that call there from then calling at Spanish ports. 
Britain has made it clear that it would be ready to share sovereignty with Spain if the Gibraltarians agreed (they have made it equally clear they would not). Spain dislikes the principle of self-determination, perhaps because of the example it might set for its own regions. And it is adamant that it will make no deal over Ceuta and Melilla: after all, Morocco did not exist when it nabbed them in the 15th century. It sees no equivalence to Gibraltar. Others see hyprocrisy, and a prickly nationalism unbecoming to a modern democracy.

UNPREPARED the Socialists may have been, but that has not stopped them announcing a stream of policies on everything from abortion to water. The more difficult domestic issues, however, can wait. Foreign affairs are different: Iraq was from day one too big to ignore, and the EU has a calendar of summits and budgets that demands attention. Spain must very soon decide whether its interests lie primarily in continental Europe, as the Socialists say, or across the Atlantic to the west, whither Mr Aznar yanked his country's foreign policy.
In fact Morocco, to Spain's south, is the first country that Mr Zapatero has visited as prime minister, taking the sensible view that Spain should be on good terms with a neighbour just 13km (eight miles) away. Similar thoughts have occurred to Spanish leaders before, but relations between the ex-colonial master and its part-protege--most of the country used to be French--have been strained for years. The Moroccans resent the continued existence of two Spanish enclaves, Ceuta and Melilla, on their northern coast. They also bridle at the periodic support given by Spaniards to the Polisario Front that seeks independence for Western (formerly Spanish) Sahara. 
For their part, the Spaniards resent Morocco's claims not just on the two enclaves but on various islets, one of which, Parsley island, it invaded two years ago in a comic incident that had to be defused by Colin Powell, America's secretary of state. In addition, Spain would like to see Morocco reduce the numbers of migrants who cross the Strait of Gibraltar--a desire reinforced by the belief that most of the bombers on March 11th were Moroccan. 
Unfortunately, it is hard to see how any of these problems can be easily settled. If Morocco is not quite an absolute monarchy, it is certainly not a democracy and, despite some recent reforms, it is not about to give independence to Western Sahara. For its part, Spain will not yield up Ceuta and Melilla. There is scope for better co-operation on terrorism and perhaps on migration, but Morocco has no magic answers: suicide bombers killed 33 bystanders in Casablanca in May 2003, and the flow of migrants will not cease until Morocco's living standards approach Spain's. 
That will not happen for years, even though Spain could do more to hasten the day. It could, for example, give Morocco more aid. Much more useful, though, would be a decision to abandon the practice of growing (with Moroccan labour) expensively irrigated vegetables and cotton in the arid south of Spain, and instead to import these crops from Morocco. Mr Zapatero has had the good sense to cancel a controversial plan to take water from the River Ebro in northern Spain down to the vegetable farms and golf courses of the parched south. But Spain's uneconomic farming practices will not end without a thorough reform of the EU's common agricultural policy, which Spanish farmers, and their governments (including the new one), stoutly resist. 
In fact, most solutions to Spain's Moroccan problems, if solutions exist, have an EU component. The EU would not condemn the invasion of Parsley island because France, which sees itself as a rival to Spain in their former colony, vetoed it. Terror, migration, farming and fishing (another source of tension) all demand joint European as much as bilateral action.

IN MANY respects Mr Zapatero and his team appear to have inherited an economy working so well that they can only enjoy it, or destroy it. In truth, they have a great opportunity to improve it. In doing so they could show that they are not doctrinaire socialists wedded to the sort of Franco-German welfarism that Mr Aznar claimed to dislike, but more market-friendly than ever he was. It will be a test.
The PP's stewardship of the public finances was exemplary, but Spain's splendid record of economic growth in 1996-2003 owed as much to the EU as to the government's management. Mr Aznar took over an economy set for take-off. Tax revenues rolled in just as interest rates began to drop in anticipation of Spain's membership of the new euro. Confidence rose and debt-service costs fell, as did public spending and then the budget deficit. When the euro was launched, low interest rates--real short-term rates have been negative for two years--set the scene for a big boost to both consumption and building.
The PP government undertook a large privatisation programme, but it did not exploit its good economic fortune to make the sort of changes that would have created a truly liberal market economy. The big state-owned enterprises in electricity, natural gas, oil and telecoms were privatised, but the state kept golden shares (since ruled illegal by the EU), picked the bosses and, directly or indirectly, appointed most of the directors.
Deregulation was similarly less than thorough. The competition court is weak and, in the big privatised industries, as Professor Jordi Gual of the IESE Business School in Barcelona points out, the aim was not so much to cut prices, which remain relatively high by EU standards, or increase consumer choice; rather it was to promote strong firms with the financial muscle to enter markets abroad and defend themselves from foreign takeover. 
The first problems for the new government are the demand for housing, which is such a large component of general economic growth, and the supply of labour, which also drives growth, though by boosting jobs, not productivity. Spain made a start on 700,000 houses last year, four times as many as Britain. Even so, prices for new Spanish houses rose 18.5% and for existing ones 16.7%. The boom continues, fuelled partly by foreigners drawn to Spain by the thought of a house in a sunny part of the euro area, partly by share-shy Spaniards looking for an investment. The upshot is that though 3m-4m houses stand empty and a similar number are used as secondary residences, many young Spaniards cannot afford even the smallest flat, and thousands of workers turn down job offers that involve moving house because they cannot find a house to move to. At the same time household indebtedness has risen sharply (nearly half of the average family's disposable income goes on servicing housing debt), while some 40% of Spanish capital stock is in nothing more productive than property.
The government has set up a housing ministry, unknown in Spain since Franco's day, and talks of creating an agency to help create a market by assuming some of the risks involved in renting. The aim is to test the agency idea in a few big cities. It does not have to be a triumph to help: even if it brought only 10% of the housing stock into the rental market, that would be a doubling. At present, nearly nine out of ten houses in Spain are owner-occupied, much the highest proportion in Europe. But no one expects quick results, partly because the high price of housing also reflects the high price of development land, which in turn reflects a scarcity artificially created by local governments that benefit from the shortage. So the system of local-government finance also needs reform.
The labour problem is equally difficult. Though 3m-4m jobs were created under the Aznar government, Spain still has an unemployment rate of 11%, the highest in the EU 15, bar Belgium's. Moreover, about 30% of those in work are on short-term contracts, and many in the black economy have no contracts at all. This reflects the unions' ability to bargain up wages and the compensation bosses must pay when a job disappears, whatever the reason. 
The roots of unemployment
The trouble really began with Franco, who wanted full employment at the expense of wages, and so made it all but impossible for employers to get rid of anyone (except on political grounds). Not surprisingly, when they could, the bosses substituted capital for labour. Excess labour was exported to Europe. With democracy, the unions won the right to increase wages while keeping their no-dismissal privileges. Unemployment, and then short-term contracts, ensued.
The new government has changed the national-insurance system to encourage the creation of more permanent and fewer short-term jobs. But the collective-bargaining system, in which negotiations are conducted by sector at national or regional level, has to change. Sceptics believe that Jess Caldera, the new labour minister, is not the man for a fight with the unions; he has already announced an increase in the minimum wage (of 6.6%), in an economy where onlookers like the IMF and the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) worry about both wage increases and productivity. If Mr Zapatero is nonetheless ready to have a showdown, it would be a sign of his mettle: Mr Caldera is perhaps his closest ally.
Other pressures will crowd in upon the new team. Mr Solbes is well aware that he faces ""very tough"" negotiations with his colleagues before the September budget. The government is committed to lots more social spending--which has been falling as a share of GDP since 1994 and, at 20%, is well below the EU-15 average of 27.5%--as well as more foreign aid, more police and such projects as extending the high-speed railway to Barcelona. At the same time Mr Solbes directly controls less than half the economy--the remainder is in the hands of the regions--and the government is dependent in parliament on regional parties. 
Nonetheless, he is pledged to balance the budget over the economic cycle, as befits the stern guardian, until recently, of the EU's growth and stability pact (as the monetary commissioner in Brussels). The budget was just in surplus last year, but this year is likely to be in deficit to the tune of 0.9% of GDP. With the economy expected to grow at about 3% in 2004, shouldn't Spain instead be running a big budget surplus, so that it can run a deficit when the cycle demands it? Aha, says Mr Solbes, it all depends on when the cycle is said to begin and end. 
No one expects Mr Solbes to be profligate. The harder question is whether he and his colleagues will prove to be liberalisers. Some people already detect worrying signs of a hankering for ""national champions"": Endesa, the biggest electricity supplier, has been talking to La Caixa, the biggest savings bank (which happens to control a water company and the former gas monopoly), about the formation of a conglomerate offering the cross-marketing of water, gas and electricity. Spanish Socialists who take their cue from France might welcome such a merger. 
However, the budget minister, Miguel ngel Fernndez Ordnez, is likely to push for market reforms, as is Miguel Sebastin, the prime minister's economic adviser. Mr Fernndez Ordnez has already shown his lack of socialist dogma by saying he would not rule out the privatisation of the state's hideously indebted television company; and Mr Sebastin, who was chief economist at Banco Bilbao Vizcaya Argentaria, Spain's second-largest bank, is known to favour a flat-rate income tax. Indeed, he was fired from his job at BBVA at the request of the Aznar government for his work on this subject; so too was his counterpart, Fernando Fernandez Mendez de Andes, at Santander Central Hispano, the biggest bank, for the same misdemeanour. 
The tax system is certainly due for reform. Evasion is widespread--Spain's black economy is commonly put at over a fifth of GDP, nearly as much as Italy's--and too many poor people pay too much tax, while too many rich pay too little. The seriously rich need pay very little indeed, thanks to vehicles such as family-owned mutual funds or companies which enable them to pay just 1% of realised gains and nothing at all on undistributed dividends.
Mind your three Ps
A responsible government would soon tackle three other issues--prices, productivity and pensions. Price inflation is reducing the competitiveness of Spain's exports, especially in Europe. But holding prices down will be painful. Any closing of the differential with other countries depends, at least partly, on cutting wage costs through labour-market reforms. 
Productivity is also related to the labour market, though any improvement here will involve efforts on a variety of fronts including education, bringing women into the workforce, and research and development. Everyone is agreed that Spain spends too little on R&D (about 1% of GDP, which is roughly half the EU's average and roughly a third of America's), and that it makes too little use of technology. Spain's banks are automated and efficient; likewise Inditex, which owns the fashion chain Zara, makes clever use of technology, albeit of a fairly unsophisticated kind. But Spain has been slow to embrace the internet--only 23% of households were wired in 2002--and its universities are weak in science and technology. 
The OECD last year called for ""an ambitious and speedy reform"" of the pension system to bring retired people's pensions more closely into line with their contributions, and to slow the growth of pension spending after 2015-20. One difficulty is that, while Spaniards' life expectancy is growing--that is, the population is getting older--Spanish women have lost their eagerness to have babies. The fertility rate (the average number of children per woman) dropped from 3.0 in 1967 to 1.3 in 2001, well below the replacement rate of 2.1. It is now one of the lowest in the world. The result is that, even with immigration, Spain is in for a demographic shock, which, though it will strike later than similar shocks in most other rich countries, predicts the OECD, will be more severe. 
The new government says it will extend monthly payments of euro100 a child to non-working mothers to encourage them to breed, but pension reform is also needed. The OECD suggests a first step would be to base pensions on workers' contributions over their entire career, not, as at present, over the final 15 years.
No government could put all this right overnight. But by fostering competition, Mr Zapatero could stimulate the necessary changes. If he pressed on with privatisation, strengthened utility regulation and the competition court, and improved corporate governance, Spain would have a competitive economy, with businesses strong enough to venture out into the non-Spanish-speaking world.
That was at least part of what was supposed to happen when Mr Aznar joined other European leaders in Lisbon four years ago to pledge themselves to making the EU ""the most competitive and dynamic knowledge-based economy in the world"" by 2010. Like most EU countries, Spain still has a long way to go.",230,Spain,"A fat pig awaits, if only the Socialists will do to the economy what the PP did not

That was at least part of what was supposed to happen when Mr Aznar joined other European leaders in Lisbon four years ago to pledge themselves to making the EU ""the most competitive and dynamic knowledge-based economy in the world"" by 2010. Like most EU countries, Spain still has a long way to go.",True

PERHAPS the most awkward issue that confronts Mr Zapatero's government is that of regionalism--or is the word nationalism? That very uncertainty gives a clue to the delicacy of the subject. Viewed from Madrid--or Castile, from which both Mr Zapatero and Mr Aznar come--places like Catalonia and the Basque provinces are regions, and their quest for more power is regionalism. Viewed from Barcelona or Bilbao, the local people are nations, and nationalism is the name of the game.
Except it isn't a game. The tension between the centre and the periphery, or parts of it, is constantly felt in almost every aspect of Spanish politics, and for many it is deadly serious. Set aside, for a moment, ETA, the only group prepared to use violence to achieve its end, the creation of a Basque state. Though about 120,000 people are willing to support its now-banned political wing, Batasuna, no democrat is ready to defend its methods, and in this sense it is beyond the pale. But all the other regionalist parties, which can be found from Galicia in the north to the Canaries in the south-west, are more or less reasonable, and certainly non-violent.
Even so, the onlooker watching the Catalan television weatherman talking about rain falling ""in the Spanish state"" (ie, not in Catalonia), or his sports counterpart hyperventilating because the local rollerskate-hockey team has been accepted as a ""national"" one by an international federation, may well wonder whether nationalism and a sense of humour are at all compatible. The feelings of fury aroused by diehard Castilians on the other side can be just as absurd. Indeed, most Spaniards will not even contemplate the possibility of some part of the country seceding. For many, that would be treason.
Nothing is simple about Spain's regional politics. The country is federal in many respects, but not formally or symmetrically so and, though it is divided into 17 ""autonomous communities"", their rights and responsibilities vary. No wonder. Spain never really was a unitary state, despite Franco's best efforts to make it ""Espana, una, libre, grande"". Navarre did not join the parts reconquered in 1492 until 20 years later and, more important, Aragon, Catalonia and the Basques all kept their ancient identities to some degree. The Catalans made bids for independence in the 17th and 18th centuries, and got a good measure of it, three times, in the 20th century. The Basques have long struggled to preserve their language and culture, and have succeeded, to the extent that for centuries Spanish kings would go to Guernica in the Basque country to recognise the fueros (ancient rights) of the Basques. 
Not everywhere had a strong regional identity, though the 1978 constitution has created regional demands from places such as Galicia, where many people speak the local language and which now has a nationalist party. Even Andalusia is getting in on the act, asking for a revision of its ""statute"", the contract each region has with the central government. And invented regions, such as Cantabria, Madrid and Murcia, are fast changing from purely bureaucratic entities into something more economic and political, even if they make no cultural claims. All this annoys the Basques and Catalans, who feel their uniqueness is being diluted.
To most outsiders, many of these regions now have more powers than they know what to do with--a consequence of the cafe para todos (coffee all round) principle embodied in the 1978 constitution. The Basques have more powers than most, including responsibility for almost all tax-collection (a share of what they collect is handed over to the treasury to pay for foreign affairs, defence and the monarchy) and corresponding rights to spend it (social security is the only significant area outside their control). They even control their own police. Navarre has similar fiscal rights, and Catalonia is not far behind. Yet many clamour for more. What, and why?
Ask that of Josu Jon Imaz, the president of the Basque National Party (PNV), and you get an utterly reasonable answer. The Basques, he explains, are a nation. They want to be recognised as such, to have all the powers they judge necessary to control their own affairs and to take advantage of the rights of representation that now exist in the EU for subnational governments. 
So do they want to secede? Goodness gracious no, not now anyway. They do not even want to have a referendum on the question of secession. But they do want one to approve a proposal promoted by Mr Ibarretxe, the PNV premier of the Basque region, which Mr Imaz insists is really about changes to the Basque statute, but which many others describe as a plan for a referendum on self-determination: not a shall-we-secede question, of course, merely a do-we-have-the-right-to-ask-whether-we-should-secede question. 
The Ibarretxe plan infuriates most politicians, and both the Socialists and the PP are against it. But some think the fuss is excessive. Miguel Herrero Rodrguez de Minn, for instance, a wise conservative who helped write the 1978 constitution, sees the plan as ""a point of equilibrium"", which keeps the Basques' essential links with the Spanish state while giving them greater recognition as a people.
The premier of Catalonia, Pasqual Maragall, also wants a revision of Catalonia's statute, though as a Socialist, not a nationalist, he makes more modest demands. He would like more powers for Catalonia (over tax-collection, for example) and changes to the national Senate to make it more of a regional body. He would also like Catalonia to get in on the European act, greater recognition of Catalan as a language, the right of Catalonia to have its own court of final appeal for certain cases and so on. Strictly no talk of self-determination, though.
Yet critics wonder whether this will always be so, and with some cause. Enter into discourse with regional politicians and you encounter, on the one hand, apparently reasonable demands for greater control over this or that and, at the same time, increasingly abstract discussions about the need for recognition, a ""free state associated with Spain"", sovereignty, self-government (as distinct from independence) and a variety of other notions that mean different things to different people, and sometimes different things on different occasions to the same people. Moreover, the more the nationalists extract from the centre, the more local voters show their gratitude by voting for them.
Insatiable
For this reason, the critics may well be right to say that nationalists are never satisfied: give in to their first requests and they never say thank-you and dissolve their party. Instead, they come forward with new demands. This is what Gustavo de Arstegui y San Romn, a PP member of the central government from the Basque country, calls the ""syndrome of revindication""--the nationalists' constant redefinition of their objectives in more extreme ways, coupled with a rewriting of history to keep alive the memory of old injustices. It is as familiar in Quebec as it is in Spain.
So are the charges and counter-charges that pass between centre and periphery. In Madrid, the visitor is told dark tales of what goes on in Catalonia and the Basque country. University teachers in Barcelona can lecture in English or Catalan, but not Spanish, it is said. If Catalonia were independent, the Council of Europe would find it in contravention of its duties to its Castilian-speaking minority. After over 25 years of PNV government (sometimes in coalition) in the Basque country, patronage is so rife that non-nationalists stand little chance of preferment. That is one reason why 300,000 people have left. And of those who stay to work, many prefer to live outside the region and bring up their families not just in relative safety but in an atmosphere free from nationalist political correctness. As for the nuttiest Basque ideologues, what other bunch since the Nazis has made such a fuss of blood groups, skull sizes and racial purity?
For their part, nationalists point out that their languages are as Spanish as Castilian, so why shouldn't they be allowed to use them in the supposedly regional chamber, the Senate? Why is it impossible to take a train, let alone a high-speed one, from Barcelona to Bilbao? (Answer, because the country has been developed on a Madrid-centred hub-and-spoke principle.) Why has there been no dispersion of national bodies round the country, except for one judicial training school to Barcelona? Why is even the Valencia-to-Majorca shipping company headquartered in Madrid? Why did the PP start flying a huge national flag in the Plaza de Coln in Madrid, with soldiers constantly saluting it, if not to annoy the regions?
Whatever the merits of these charges, one or two facts do stand out. The first is that no official figures are available to show which regions are net contributors to the public purse, and which are net beneficiaries. Yet any changes to the regions' political powers must take place within a financial system that guarantees a minimum standard of universal benefits throughout the country. 
Spain is fortunate: it has no huge area of relative poverty, like Germany's east or Italy's Mezzogiorno. But some parts, such as Andalusia and Extremadura, are not well off, and it is the richer parts, notably Catalonia and the Basque region, that are most vigorous in demanding ever more control over tax and spending. It is already said that the Basques pay little or nothing in net terms to help the others; the only net contributors, it seems, are Catalonia, Madrid and the Balearic islands. 
The danger is that further devolution will make the poor poorer. Mr Zapatero's economic team thinks the regions should contribute to the kitty according to their income, and receive according to their population. Whether this is the best principle should be a matter for negotiation, but a clear and simple system of regional finance is needed, which would show exactly how much each region transfers to and from the central government. Some form of equalisation could then ensue.
Second, Mr Aznar's war against ETA has left it severely weakened. Whether this makes it more or less intransigent is open to debate, but the moment is opportune for it to declare a ceasefire. Terror, as a weapon, has never been more unpopular in Spain. Moreover, the new government is more flexible than its predecessor, though it too is sternly opposed to anything to do with ETA: it went to court last month to prevent Herritarren Zerrenda from contesting the European elections, successfully arguing that this new party was Batasuna in a different guise.
Third, ETA's campaign of murder and intimidation has had a much bigger effect on the Basque country than is commonly realised. To watch the promenaders strolling by the beach in San Sebastin on a spring evening makes this seem the most delightful of towns. The locals say that, whether in terms of health care or the quality of the roads, life in the Basque region is unmatched elsewhere in Spain. Yet, now that Northern Ireland is quieter, there is no other place in Europe where 40,000 officials, magistrates, businessmen, politicians and journalists live in fear of assassination. Perhaps 2,000 or 3,000 are judged to need bodyguards.
Fourth, however defined, nationalism is not going away. Though the combined vote for the conservatives and the Socialists has increased at every election over the past 15 years, from 65% of the total in 1979 to 80% in 2004, nationalists still control the Basque region, and their counterparts are gaining ground elsewhere. True, they have lost control in Catalonia, but the Socialists in charge there now are strongly regional in their outlook, and rule Catalonia in coalition with a nationalist group whose parliamentary strength increased from one to eight in the March election. 
So Mr Zapatero is in hock to the Catalan Socialists, who are in turn in hock to a bunch of fiery left-wing nationalists. Even if he were inclined to do nothing, he would find the pressure difficult to resist. As it is, he is committed to some minor but sensible changes to the Senate, reform of certain statutes and a role for the regions in some EU deliberations. But he knows this is awkward stuff which could prove time-consuming in parliament. 
All the signs are that Mr Zapatero will give as little as possible to the Basques. He shows no sign of yielding in his opposition to the Ibarretxe plan, and Juan Fernando Lpez Aguilar, his bright young justice minister, says firmly, ""The Socialist Party will never accept self-determination for any part of Spain."" The Socialists point out that constitutional change needs the agreement of other parties, including the PP.
Why not call their bluff?
In time, though, it would be refreshing to see a Spanish prime minister challenging the nationalists to face the consequences of their demands. Instead of flatly ruling out self-determination on constitutional grounds, he could say, ""All right, let's settle the terms on which you could secede and then we'll see whether you really want to do it."" Something like this lay behind the Clarity Act that Canada passed in 2000 to deal with Quebec's constant demands for ""sovereignty"". It helped there, and could help in Spain. Opinion polls suggest that barely a quarter of Basques are diehard secessionists; a study by the BBVA, the big local bank, suggests they would be much less well off on their own. And the Catalans clearly have no wish to depart.
On the other hand, many people in the regions have a completely understandable desire to be ruled with a more sensitive hand from Madrid, to promote their language and culture and to enjoy a degree of self-rule. And if, perchance, one day the Basques, say, did vote to peel off, would it be the end of the world? Who wants to keep captive within their borders a people who want to leave?

IT WAS a British Conservative, John Major, who came to power in 1990 saying he wanted to build ""a country that is at ease with itself, a country that is confident, a country...willing to make...changes"". Mr Major was largely talking about ridding Britain of its class system, not a big problem for Spain, but his words might well serve for a Spanish Socialist today.
The central cause of Spain's absence of ease is the civil war and the long period of Francoism after it. As Paloma Aguilar, of UNED, Spain's ""open"" university, has written, by 1975 Spanish society had managed to reach agreement, not on an uncontested account of what happened during the civil war, but at least on some lessons to be drawn from it. The main one was that the two warring sides were equally responsible for the barbarism, and neither bore more guilt than the other. The episode was simply the result of ""collective madness"".
This general understanding--an understanding, if you like, not to stir too disruptively--made possible, first, the Moncloa pacts between the party leaders during the transition, which established some agreed rules of political engagement. More lastingly, it made possible the success that Spain has enjoyed on almost every front during the past 30 years. 
The understanding did not, however, exorcise all the ghosts of Franco, or all the legacies of his regime. It left a Catholic church rather too closely tied to the state for an increasingly secular country with a grim, if distant, history of religious persecution. And it left a conservative party rather too authoritarian for a modern democracy, for, though Mr Aznar did much to make the PP respectable, he did nothing to broaden debate within the party. He knew he could not lead it for more than two terms, but he did not report back, did not trust his lieutenants, especially in the foreign ministry, and did little to encourage the development of internal expertise. Neither did he give the PP a democratic structure. He chose his own successor.
The agreement not to look back, or not too closely anyway, also led to a rather curious consensus. This was not a consensus of the post-war Italian kind, in which government was undertaken jointly by all the ""respectable"" parties in coalition amid a general sharing of the spoils. In Spain, the consensus changed with the government. It meant that when the PP was in power, the done thing was to support it, to defer to it and to seek its approval. When the Socialists took over, though, a remarkable switch took place: suddenly it became fashionable, as it is now, to declare support for the new government, to flatter it and to revile the outgoing lot. 
It is a pattern of excessive deference, followed by excessive rejection, if not humiliation. Thus, on leaving office, Adolfo Surez, Spain's first post-Franco prime minister, was likened to a Mississippi card sharp; Mr Gonzlez, the third prime minister, was abused in public and dared not visit universities for fear of attack; and now there is talk of Mr Aznar being taken to court for war crimes.
Franco's legacy is seen even more clearly in the unease caused by nationalism. Spain would have had regional demands of some kind without Franco. But it is revealing that the nationalism in the three Basque provinces of France is very much less troublesome than the nationalism in the four Basque provinces of Spain. Franco's attempts to suppress the non-Castilian elements of Spanish culture led to the bitterness, as well as the vigour, that accompanied their resurgence. 
Mr Aznar made matters worse by behaving like a Margaret Thatcher when there was no need of one. Spain had a political-cum-security problem with ETA, much as Britain had with the IRA, but Spain had no vested interests like Britain's trade unions to face down. In any event, Basques and Catalans now feel unnecessarily slighted, and at the same time the nationalists among them have bred a tiresome victim mentality in their regions. 
Getting there
What can Mr Zapatero's government do to put matters right? It has, on the whole, made a good start. It has embarked on some overdue social reforms, concerning divorce, abortion, gay marriage, domestic violence and other women's issues. (Mr Zapatero is clearly in earnest when he calls himself a feminist: half his cabinet are women, and he is ready to change the constitution to allow a woman to ascend the throne.) These measures will win the government some friends and make it no enemies outside the Catholic church, and even the church is shifting on some issues.
Some other reforms are less certain, but would be just as desirable: stricter corporate governance, a stronger competition court, an end to the pro-government bias in parliamentary committees and the depoliticisation of Spain's large companies. All these would reduce the power of politicians and increase the independence of other institutions.
Next comes a real test: public broadcasting. Radio Televisin Espanola, especially its television news, is by common consent a disgrace, a government mouthpiece that would not be out of place in a banana republic of yore. Governments, including Socialist ones, have vowed to reform it before, only to find that a government mouthpiece can be very useful at times. Mr Zapatero says he will do better. He has appointed an academic widely seen as independent, Carmen Caffarel, as director-general. And he has set up a committee of ""wise personages"" to make recommendations for a truly independent service along the lines of the BBC. Hopes are high for real change this time. 
Feedstock for the future
His next task should be to shake up the education system, especially the universities. Spain has opted for a huge expansion in the number of its universities, two-thirds of which have been created since 1975, but this has done little to improve either the quality of teaching or the students' independence of thought. Standards are low, and the system produces too many lawyers, too few scientists.
There are a few good private universities, especially in Catalonia and Navarre, and one or two good business schools such as IESE's two campuses in Barcelona and Madrid, but too many students hang around, often for six or eight years, doing courses that would be completed in three or four elsewhere. Few are thrown out for failing exams; they just take them again and again until they pass. As for the teachers, they are usually recruited from within the university, often for life, and have little experience of the outside world. The upshot, says Vctor Perez-Daz, a sociologist who has taught at Harvard and the University of California as well as Madrid's Complutense University, is a body of uninquiring students who cannot write, set priorities or elaborate an argument. 
Then comes the issue of nationalism. Mr Zapatero is much less abrasive than Mr Aznar, and he has the advantage not only of being a new face himself, but also of dealing with several new faces in the regions. Yet nationalism excites strong passions and he may still find the going hard, particularly if he allows the impression to take hold that he is seeking ""a solution to the problem"". This would be a mistake.
The best he can hope to do is to manage nationalism. It can be managed well or it can be managed badly, but it cannot be solved. That is because it is not a problem, and indeed one way to ensure a bad outcome is to think of it as such. Better by far to see it as a blessing--a blessing that gives Spain variety, cultural vitality and internal competition of the best kind, allowing innovation and experimentation.
Recognition of this comes cheap and is likely to yield rich rewards. It would reinforce the strength of Spain as a country that is considerably greater than the sum of its parts. It would also do much to relieve the country's internal tensions and make it more at ease with itself. It would give it confidence. If this could be combined with changes in behaviour and attitudes, as well as institutions, to build greater independence of spirit, then the Zapatero government could be seen as the one that marked the start of the second transition, when the ghosts of the civil war and Francoism could finally be put to rest. Spain could even try to find a more plausible reason for the civil war than simple ""collective madness"".
Mr Zapatero could aim for even more. With a series of liberalising economic reforms, the ones that Mr Aznar failed to make in his second term, his government could launch Spain on another period of economic growth that might see it overtaking Britain and Italy in terms of income per person. Spain has most of the necessary ingredients--effective government, sound finances and a potentially strong business sector. It has shown on at least three occasions that it can overcome difficult economic circumstances: in 1975-77, when a country without even a democratic constitution suffered a serious oil shock; in 1982, when, after an attempted coup a year earlier, an untested Socialist government faced another deep economic crisis; and in 1992-93, when the peseta was struggling to stay in the EU's exchange-rate mechanism. 
If Mr Zapatero can provide the right leadership, Spain can bound forward again. Zapatero, a tus zapatos. Let the cobbler stick to his last.
Caption: The ghosts live on",230,Spain,"Mr Zapatero has the chance to take Spain into a new era of harmony and prosperity
IT WAS a British Conservative, John Major, who came to power in 1990 saying he wanted to build ""a country that is at ease with itself, a country that is confident, a country...willing to make...changes"". Mr Major was largely talking about ridding Britain of its class system, not a big problem for Spain, but his words might well serve for a Spanish Socialist today.
The central cause of Spain's absence of ease is the civil war and the long period of Francoism after it. As Paloma Aguilar, of UNED, Spain's ""open"" university, has written, by 1975 Spanish society had managed to reach agreement, not on an uncontested account of what happened during the civil war, but at least on some lessons to be drawn from it. The main one was that the two warring sides were equally responsible for the barbarism, and neither bore more guilt than the other. The episode was simply the result of ""collective madness"".
This general understanding--an understanding, if you like, not to stir too disruptively--made possible, first, the Moncloa pacts between the party leaders during the transition, which established some agreed rules of political engagement. More lastingly, it made possible the success that Spain has enjoyed on almost every front during the past 30 years. 
The understanding did not, however, exorcise all the ghosts of Franco, or all the legacies of his regime. It left a Catholic church rather too closely tied to the state for an increasingly secular country with a grim, if distant, history of religious persecution. And it left a conservative party rather too authoritarian for a modern democracy, for, though Mr Aznar did much to make the PP respectable, he did nothing to broaden debate within the party. He knew he could not lead it for more than two terms, but he did not report back, did not trust his lieutenants, especially in the foreign ministry, and did little to encourage the development of internal expertise. Neither did he give the PP a democratic structure. He chose his own successor.
The agreement not to look back, or not too closely anyway, also led to a rather curious consensus. This was not a consensus of the post-war Italian kind, in which government was undertaken jointly by all the ""respectable"" parties in coalition amid a general sharing of the spoils. In Spain, the consensus changed with the government. It meant that when the PP was in power, the done thing was to support it, to defer to it and to seek its approval. When the Socialists took over, though, a remarkable switch took place: suddenly it became fashionable, as it is now, to declare support for the new government, to flatter it and to revile the outgoing lot. 
It is a pattern of excessive deference, followed by excessive rejection, if not humiliation. Thus, on leaving office, Adolfo Surez, Spain's first post-Franco prime minister, was likened to a Mississippi card sharp; Mr Gonzlez, the third prime minister, was abused in public and dared not visit universities for fear of attack; and now there is talk of Mr Aznar being taken to court for war crimes.
Franco's legacy is seen even more clearly in the unease caused by nationalism. Spain would have had regional demands of some kind without Franco. But it is revealing that the nationalism in the three Basque provinces of France is very much less troublesome than the nationalism in the four Basque provinces of Spain. Franco's attempts to suppress the non-Castilian elements of Spanish culture led to the bitterness, as well as the vigour, that accompanied their resurgence. 
Mr Aznar made matters worse by behaving like a Margaret Thatcher when there was no need of one. Spain had a political-cum-security problem with ETA, much as Britain had with the IRA, but Spain had no vested interests like Britain's trade unions to face down. In any event, Basques and Catalans now feel unnecessarily slighted, and at the same time the nationalists among them have bred a tiresome victim mentality in their regions. 
Getting there
What can Mr Zapatero's government do to put matters right? It has, on the whole, made a good start. It has embarked on some overdue social reforms, concerning divorce, abortion, gay marriage, domestic violence and other women's issues. (Mr Zapatero is clearly in earnest when he calls himself a feminist: half his cabinet are women, and he is ready to change the constitution to allow a woman to ascend the throne.) These measures will win the government some friends and make it no enemies outside the Catholic church, and even the church is shifting on some issues.
Some other reforms are less certain, but would be just as desirable: stricter corporate governance, a stronger competition court, an end to the pro-government bias in parliamentary committees and the depoliticisation of Spain's large companies. All these would reduce the power of politicians and increase the independence of other institutions.
Next comes a real test: public broadcasting. Radio Televisin Espanola, especially its television news, is by common consent a disgrace, a government mouthpiece that would not be out of place in a banana republic of yore. Governments, including Socialist ones, have vowed to reform it before, only to find that a government mouthpiece can be very useful at times. Mr Zapatero says he will do better. He has appointed an academic widely seen as independent, Carmen Caffarel, as director-general. And he has set up a committee of ""wise personages"" to make recommendations for a truly independent service along the lines of the BBC. Hopes are high for real change this time. 
Feedstock for the future
His next task should be to shake up the education system, especially the universities. Spain has opted for a huge expansion in the number of its universities, two-thirds of which have been created since 1975, but this has done little to improve either the quality of teaching or the students' independence of thought. Standards are low, and the system produces too many lawyers, too few scientists.
There are a few good private universities, especially in Catalonia and Navarre, and one or two good business schools such as IESE's two campuses in Barcelona and Madrid, but too many students hang around, often for six or eight years, doing courses that would be completed in three or four elsewhere. Few are thrown out for failing exams; they just take them again and again until they pass. As for the teachers, they are usually recruited from within the university, often for life, and have little experience of the outside world. The upshot, says Vctor Perez-Daz, a sociologist who has taught at Harvard and the University of California as well as Madrid's Complutense University, is a body of uninquiring students who cannot write, set priorities or elaborate an argument. 
Then comes the issue of nationalism. Mr Zapatero is much less abrasive than Mr Aznar, and he has the advantage not only of being a new face himself, but also of dealing with several new faces in the regions. Yet nationalism excites strong passions and he may still find the going hard, particularly if he allows the impression to take hold that he is seeking ""a solution to the problem"". This would be a mistake.
The best he can hope to do is to manage nationalism. It can be managed well or it can be managed badly, but it cannot be solved. That is because it is not a problem, and indeed one way to ensure a bad outcome is to think of it as such. Better by far to see it as a blessing--a blessing that gives Spain variety, cultural vitality and internal competition of the best kind, allowing innovation and experimentation.

SPAIN'S shock change of government in March has left its corporate bosses all a-fluster. They do not know whether the new Socialist prime minister, Jose Luis Rodrguez Zapatero, will poke his nose into business as much as did Jose Mara Aznar, his centre-right predecessor. Above all, they are wondering if he will let them keep their jobs. In the past, a change of government in Spain has often been followed by a purge of company bosses with connections to the opposite political camp.
Last week Pedro Mielgo, the well-regarded boss of Red Electrica de Espana, a 29% state-owned company that operates most of Spain's high-voltage electricity cable, had to step aside for Luis Atienza, a former Socialist minister. Reports in the Spanish press say that two board members of Telefonica, a telecoms giant, will be replaced by Carlos Solchaga, a former Socialist economics minister, and Claudio Aranzadi, a former minister of industry. The job of Cesar Alierta, the boss of Telefonica, is rumoured to be on the line.
The privatisation of many big Spanish firms has not ended the state's influence over them, though it has been weakened to an extent that may soon become clear. Mr Zapatero has tried to ease worries about the state's heavy hand. He appointed a reassuring economics minister, Pedro Solbes, a former European commissioner for monetary affairs. His economic adviser is Miguel Sebastin, a well-respected economist, who says that the government's economic policy will be inspired by America's under Bill Clinton. 
Yet Mr Aznar, when he became prime minister, paid lip service to free competition too, only to engage in complicated telephone diplomacy to secure top jobs in newly privatised companies for his friends. ""Aznar's men were control freaks,"" says William Chislett at the Real Instituto Elcano, a think tank in Madrid. In 1996 Alfonso Cortina, a close friend of Rodrigo Rato, Mr Aznar's economics minister, replaced scar Fanjul as boss of Repsol, an oil and gas firm. Mr Alierta, another friend of Mr Rato's, took over at Telefnica in 2000. Pablo Isla succeeded Mr Alierta at the helm of Tabacalera. Manuel Pizarro, an ally of Mr Aznar, became boss of Endesa, an energy utility, in 2002. Fernando Conte became top dog at Iberia, the national airline, in 2003. Many observers think that the ties of Messrs Cortina, Pizarro, Alierta, Isla and Conte to the party that lost the elections will now cost them their job.
Mr Zapatero has ways to exert control even over privatised firms, should he wish to. The government has golden shares in many of them, giving it the right to veto important decisions--despite the European Court of Justice declaring such shares illegal. Though entirely in private hands, firms such as Repsol and Telefonica are subject to government regulation. (Mr Solbes is planning to free the competition authority from state influence, but the regulators for energy and for telecoms, as well as the stock-exchange commission, are likely to remain under government control.) If their boards or big shareholders are made aware that the government is likely to regulate less favourably while the current boss remains in place, they will know what to do.

""WE THOUGHT the days of governments giving jobs to friends, meddling in companies and overriding shareholders were a thing of the past."" The reasons for this outcry from Eduardo Zaplana, a slick spokesman for Spain's centre-right opposition, are obvious to anyone who has seen the sweeping personnel changes, in every area of public and semi-private life, which have followed the Socialist election victory last March.
In the finest traditions of Mediterranean democracy, heads have been rolling in every agency under the government's control--and in many places that are supposed to be independent. There have been purges at think-tanks, the judiciary and the Cervantes Institute, which represents Spain's culture. The state-owned media, several key embassies, the security services and Madrid's museums have all seen changes at the top.
It is true, of course, that every democracy plays musical chairs by its own rules. Newcomers to America are often amazed by how many jobs change hands with a new administration; in Britain, the scope for government patronage--while amply exploited--is comparatively limited. But in Spain, as in many parts of southern Europe, new administrations play patronage games with a gusto that amazes people from further north.
Like every Mediterranean country, Spain has a rich set of words and customs surrounding the practice of patronage. If you have friends in high places and use them to get a job, you are said to have an enchufe or literally, a plug. To show gratitude for a political favour--what in America might be called a piece of pork--you can send your helper a jamon, a leg of ham.
It takes more than a change of government to change a political culture. But Jose Luis Rodrguez Zapatero, the Socialist prime minister, may have a chance to break with the excesses of political favour-trading--if he keeps a vow to respect the independence of private firms and regulators. At least in theory, the Socialists are committed to strengthening the agencies which regulate energy, financial markets, and mergers and monopolies; none of these bodies has ever had many teeth. A start has been made with the naming of a respected figure, Manuel Conthe, as head of the Comisin Nacional del Mercado de Valores, which oversees financial markets.
What everyone wants to know now is how far the Socialists will use their influence to alter the management of newly privatised companies in which the state still has a share. Already there has been one change: a Socialist ex-minister, Luis Atienza, has been put in charge of Red Electrica de Espana, a power distribution firm of which the state owns just over a quarter.
Will there be more? Pedro Solbes, the finance minister, murmurs that he wants to see ""honest, competent"" people in top business jobs. Mr Zaplana, from the opposition People's Party, retorts angrily: ""Presidents of companies answer to stock-holders, not the government."" But that is a bit rich, coming from a man whose party used to cram big firms with its cronies.

Further plans include allowing women to inherit the Spanish throne, liberalising the country's abortion laws, lifting restrictions on embryo research and cracking down on domestic violence.
Mr Zapatero's centre-right predecessor, Jose Mara Aznar, was broadly in favour of economic liberalisation.

Mr Zapatero, whose first overseas visit was to Morocco, stood in the shadow of a statue depicting Spain's patron saint, St James the Moor Slayer, on a white charger, hacking off the heads of Moors. Church officials had just overturned a decision to remove the statue, an 18th-century work by Jose Gambino, from the cathedral after it was deemed offensive to Muslims.

He declared that marriage is ""essentially heterosexual"" and that the church had every right to interfere in national politics ""in cases of people's fundamental rights or the salvation of souls"". ""It is not possible to truly understand or serve Spain without taking into account its Christian roots,"" he added. Later the pope, who had praised Mr Aznar for his ""loyal collaboration"", reproached Mr Zapatero. Spanish bishops have called for the faithful to demonstrate against the reforms.
Stung by such attacks, the labour minister, Jess Caldera, has hit back that the church's preferential arrangement ""has to end"". He is referring to the arrangement whereby Spaniards can tick a box offering a percentage of their taxes to the church. The sum gathered adds up to euro78m ($95m). Since this is only just over half the church's annual budget, the government makes up the rest directly. The head of the church in Spain, Antonio Mara Rouco, insists that it is ""logical"" that a religion to which over 70% of the population subscribes appears in the tax box.

IT WAS a spectacular coup. On October 3rd Mikel ""Antza"" Albizu Iriarte, political leader and chief ideologue of ETA, the Basque terrorist group, was arrested in the town of Salies-de-Bearn in France, along with his girlfriend, Soledad ""Anboto"" Iparragirre Genetxea. Fifteen other suspects were also nabbed. In seven separate caches, arms were found, among them over 1,200kg of explosives, two Russian-made ground-to-air missiles, 44 submachineguns and an assortment of pistols. Following leads gathered in the raid, five more suspected ETA members were later arrested on the Spanish side of the border, in Pamplona, San Sebastin and Irn. They were reportedly awaiting instructions to carry out attacks.
The French justice minister, Dominique Perben, hailed the capture of ETA's political leader as ""a great battle won in the war against terrorism...a very fine operation"". Spain's prime minister, Jose Luis Rodrguez Zapatero, trumpeted ""a major step towards ending the violence of the terrorist group, ETA"", adding that ""ETA's destiny can only be its demise."" 
Yet Spain has been here before. ETA suffered a big setback in 1992, when another raid in a French village led to the arrest of its entire leadership. But the group, which has killed 817 people since its first assassination in 1968, sprang back to life. Is there anything new this time? ETA has long used southern France as a sanctuary, and a base from which to launch attacks on Spain. Indeed, many Spaniards have suspected France of turning a blind eye as long as no atrocities were committed on French soil. But though some suspicions linger, co-operation between the French and Spanish in hunting down ETA has been stepped up since the mid-1990s.
According to the Spanish newspaper El Pas, as many as 164 of the 709 ETA suspects who are now in detention were arrested in France. And it is the French who catch the biggest fish. In April ETA's logistics chief, Felix Ignacio Esparza Luri, and its political and military co-ordinator, Felix Alberto Lopez de la Calle, were both arrested in France. The Spanish and French police forces have set up joint squads dedicated to pursuing ETA.
Is there now a chance of greater co-operation still? Mr Zapatero's centre-right predecessor, Jose Mara Aznar, puffed up his record against ETA. But given Mr Zapatero's wish to strengthen Spain's links with France and to eschew Mr Aznar's pro-American stance, Spaniards hope for still more action against ETA. The group's last fatal attack was in May 2003, when two policemen were killed by a car bomb in Navarre. In the summer ETA managed a series of low-level bomb attacks in seaside resorts. Last month it planted some bombs beside pylons in the Basque region.
The Spanish hope that ETA will now disintegrate into an obscure and politically impotent terrorist group. But some doubts remain. ETA still has strong backing among supporters of Batasuna, the banned Basque nationalist party. And the large country house in which Antza and Anboto lived quietly, fattening their ducks, before their capture has given commentators further food for thought. Why did it take so long to arrest them?

IT WAS a spectacular coup. On October 3rd Mikel ""Antza"" Albizu Iriarte, political leader and chief ideologue of ETA, the Basque terrorist group, was arrested in the town of Salies-de-Bearn in France, along with his girlfriend, Soledad ""Anboto"" Iparragirre Genetxea. Fifteen other suspects were also nabbed. In seven separate caches, arms were found, among them over 1,200kg of explosives, two Russian-made ground-to-air missiles, 44 submachineguns and an assortment of pistols. Following leads gathered in the raid, five more suspected ETA members were later arrested on the Spanish side of the border, in Pamplona, San Sebastin and Irn. They were reportedly awaiting instructions to carry out attacks.
The French justice minister, Dominique Perben, hailed the capture of ETA's political leader as ""a great battle won in the war against terrorism...a very fine operation"". Spain's prime minister, Jose Luis Rodrguez Zapatero, trumpeted ""a major step towards ending the violence of the terrorist group, ETA"", adding that ""ETA's destiny can only be its demise.""

THE legacy that Spain's former prime minister, Jose Mara Aznar, hoped to leave behind when he stepped down was a strong and united People's Party (PP), still in government. The terrorist attacks on Madrid trains that killed 191 people on March 11th, three days before the election, compounded by Mr Aznar's crude attempt to blame the Basque terrorist group, ETA, put an end to that. The centre-right PP was voted out. Worse, it has since been riven by in-fighting.
The party has struggled to deal both with its loss of power and with the inscrutable style of its new leader, Mariano Rajoy. The wrought-iron party discipline forged by Mr Aznar has corroded. In Galicia the 81-year-old former Franco-era minister and PP founder, Manuel Fraga, has had to face down a rebellion by party factions in Orense. More trouble came when seven regional MPs were expelled from the party in Guadalajara for criticising the new party leadership. Squabbles have broken out in Valencia, Castile La Mancha, Aragn, Asturias and even in the Moroccan enclave of Ceuta.
The PP's gloomy fortunes and its low poll ratings stand in marked contrast to those of the new government. So far, six months under the Socialist prime minister, Jose Luis Rodrguez Zapatero, have been about warm mood music and ""good feeling"". Most Spaniards approve strongly both of Mr Zapatero's withdrawal of Spanish troops from Iraq and of his raft of social reforms. Only recently have some concerns begun to surface in the party about the government's anti-Americanism, its over-zealous promises to stop a shipyard closure and its failure to respond to Spain's housing shortage.
A recent poll in El Mundo gave the Socialists a lead of almost seven points over the PP, almost two more points than it achieved in the elections. Over half of Spaniards have a very good or good opinion of Mr Zapatero; less than 15% see his government negatively. In contrast, a poll in El Pas at the end of September said that only 36% of Spaniards, and only just over half of the PP's own voters, consider Mr Rajoy to be the best man to lead the party. Madrid's mayor, Alberto Ruiz-Gallardn, and Rodrigo Rato, now head of the IMF, were both more popular choices.
Mr Aznar's great achievement was to unite the Spanish right and cast off its historic Francoist mantle. His undoing was caused, in part, by his arrogance. At the party's annual conference at the beginning of October Mr Ruiz-Gallardn conceded this, saying ""we should recognise it, we must have done something wrong."" The mishandling of the Prestige oil spill, the support for the war in Iraq, the media manipulation which included ignoring a national one-day strike as well as being seen to lie about the Madrid bombings were all doubtless in his mind.
Spain is a predominantly left-of-centre country, and Mr Rajoy has yet to find a formula to unlock more support from the centre. He has, however, toned down the harsh rhetoric of Mr Aznar. One gesture to modernise the PP was to strike the word ""Christian"" from its statutes, but this was met with howls by Roman Catholics. All the same, Mr Rajoy's more-to-life-than-politics approach (smoking cigars, watching sport) is slowly winning support.
Yet just after the party conference, Mr Ruiz-Gallardn put up his deputy, Manuel Cobo, to run against Madrid's regional premier, Esperanza Aguirre, for Madrid's party presidency. He was slapped down by the party leadership, leaving Mr Cobo to resign and lament the ""Taliban policies"" and ""moral lynching"" of the PP. Mr Rajoy has much to do to complete the process of consolidation--let alone regain power.

AFTER the shock of George Bush's re-election, Europe's elite is taking comfort in a new cliche. ""The second Bush administration"", it suggests, ""could be the greatest boost to European federalism since the cold war."" Most polls across Europe showed strong support for John Kerry, with Poland the only European country to plump for Mr Bush. Now that the bogeyman is back with a stronger mandate, those Europeans arguing for a declaration of independence from America have also had a boost. It was not hard to decode last week's statement by Jacques Chirac, France's president, that, after the American election, Europe has ""more need than ever to reinforce its unity and dynamism."" In similar vein, Jose Luis Rodrguez Zapatero, Spain's prime minister, told Der Spiegel that ""Europe must have faith in the prospect of becoming the most important global power in 20 years.""
Such exhortations are liable to be scoffed at on the other side of the Atlantic. The Europe that Mr Zapatero aspires to see as a world leader is a continent stuck with a growth rate that is feeble compared with America's, let alone China's and India's. An ageing and shrinking population hardly promises a better future. European military might remains relatively puny, while the technological gap with the United States is growing. 
Yet for all this, it would be unwise for Americans to dismiss the idea that the European Union could ever emerge as an alternative superpower. Some elements are already there; others are nascent. As Adam Posen of the Institute for International Economics in Washington, DC, points out in a recent paper, after the enlargement of the EU to 25 countries earlier this year ""Europe has finally caught up to the United States in economic size. Both economies at present have an annual income of around $11 trillion."" Mr Posen reckons, however, that this will be a ""fleeting equality"" (his paper can be found at www.brookings.edu/fp/cuse/analysis/). Projecting forward to 2020, he finds that, even on the most optimistic set of assumptions, the EU economy would then be 7% smaller than that of the United States. Take a more pessimistic scenario and the gap could be 20%. 
But Mr Posen leaves an important factor out of his calculations: the prospect of further enlargement. The EU of 25 already has 455m inhabitants, compared with 295m Americans. By 2020, it is quite plausible that the EU will have admitted Turkey and all the Balkan countries, pushing its population close to 600m. The newcomers will not be rich, but experience suggests that they will grow fast once EU membership becomes a realistic prospect. The EU could thus expand its economic might simply by continually adding new members, even if that looks a bit like arithmetical sleight of hand.
Neither a large output nor a large population guarantees that the EU will be able to project power, however. Indeed enlargement could make this task harder by making the EU increasingly unmanageable. Traditional European federalists are already worried that an enlarged EU could degenerate into little more than a talking-shop. Much will depend on how far EU members believe that they share common interests.
It is here that Mr Bush may play a role as an inadvertent federaliser. Rising levels of hostility in Europe to American ""unilateralism""--and a feeling (however premature) that America has failed in Iraq--are feeding popular demands for the creation of a European counterweight to the United States. Even before Mr Bush's re-election, this sentiment was reflected in pan-European polls. In June, the German Marshall Fund found widespread support for the idea that ""the European Union should become a superpower like the United States"". Perhaps unsurprisingly, this notion commanded 83% support in France. But it also got over 50% support in Britain and Poland.
Even if the Europeans had the will and the economic muscle to achieve superpower status, there would still be a big gap between ambition and reality. Ancient national rivalries within Europe lurk beneath the surface, and they tend to bubble up at times of international crisis: witness the splits over Iraq and before that over the Balkans. Even in less heated times, EU countries show a marked tendency to talk European but to act national. For instance, France and Britain will not countenance any talk of replacing their national seats on the UN Security Council with a single EU seat. Germany's attempt to get its own permanent membership of the Security Council is being opposed by Spain and Italy--in the name of Europe, naturally.
George Bush, recruiting sergeant
Yet taking a snapshot of the situation in 2004 and assuming it will remain forever unchanged could be misleading. For the first 30 years of its existence, the European Economic Community had no serious role in foreign policy at all. Now attempts to shape a common foreign policy are a big part of the EU's business. If the new constitution is ratified, the Union will acquire its own foreign minister and diplomatic corps. And whereas there have been high-profile debacles, particularly over Iraq, the EU's common foreign policy is making its presence felt in other areas.
The foreign ministers of Britain, France and Germany also seem optimistic that they have achieved a breakthrough in limiting Iran's nuclear ambitions. And the Europeans were highly influential in persuading Russia to sign up to the Kyoto Protocol on climate change, against the wishes of the Americans. Europe is even beginning to get its act together militarily. In December the EU will take over the military operation in Bosnia from NATO, a development treated with some suspicion in Washington.
European federalists hope that, over the next four years, Mr Bush will continue to serve as a recruiting sergeant for their cause. But they may need to seize their moment. In a generation's time, the rise of China, or radical Islam, or something else, may make efforts to depict America as a bogeyman that needs a counterweight seem deluded and frivolous.",230,Spain,"Might George Bush be a handmaiden in the building of a European superpower?

UN troops invaded a slum in Haiti's capital, Port-au-Prince, in their first big blow against gangs loyal to the former president, Jean-Bertrand Aristide.
The EU recommended that its member states' embassies in Cuba reduce friction with the authorities by holding smaller cocktail parties, so as not to have to invite either political dissidents or Cuban officials. Having both had led to a chill in diplomatic relations. So as not to dampen the Christmas cheer, however, the recommendations will take effect only in January.
Independence postponed
Taiwan's Democratic Progressive Party, the party of president Chen Shui-bian, narrowly failed to take control of parliament. China and America, which had both feared that the president would use a majority to advance the cause of Taiwanese independence, will be relieved. Mr Chen resigned as party leader.
Fernando Poe junior, who nearly unseated Gloria Arroyo as president of the Philippines in May, died suddenly.
Japan warned North Korea that it might impose sanctions after human remains provided by North Korea turned out not to be those of two kidnapped Japanese women. North Korea said that sanctions would amount to a declaration of war.",True

DARK night gave way, that Jan the first,
To hopes that now the sun would burst
On where Saddam had once been king--
Tsar, caesar, lord--of everything,
And with his acolytes and thugs, 
And poison gas and listening bugs,
Had ground the poor Iraqis down,
In field and dune and marsh and town.
The realisation soon would grow
That in his place was GI Joe,
A decent, fair and honest friend
Who had no wish his life to spend
In any country but his own--
So long as freedom had been grown. 
For GI Joe had but one aim, 
To make Iraq look just the same
As any democratic reach, 
From Oregon to West Palm Beach.
AND yet Iraq was daily rent 
By shots and blasts from men who sent
Crazed bombers out to kill and maim. 
The zealous masses they'd inflame
And stir the clerics to incite 
Their congregations to invite
The ever-conquering Yanks to go, 
And never more their faces show.
MEANWHILE, over to the east, 
Two years had passed since war had ceased,
Yet here as well some hopes were rising, 
The reason was a group comprising
Delegates from far and wide, 
Tajiks, Pushtuns, side by side, 
Aimaqs, Uzbeks, crooks and warlords, 
All agreed to sheath their broadswords,
Then sat down amid the rubble 
To see if they could ease their trouble;
And from this motley institution 
Arose an Afghan constitution.
NEXT door, where grimly clerics reign, 
Weak reformists pled in vain
With a council so hardline 
Few considered it divine.
What they sought was a selection 
To contest the next election
And thus assist th' Iranian nation 
To escape its isolation.
But the steely ayatollahs, 
Caring more for power than dollars-- 
Not that they would close their palms 
To the faithful's proffered alms--
Knew that they would lose control 
If they let reform unroll. 
So no, the critics could not stand: 
Half their candidates were banned.
Guardians of the revolution 
Must resist such vile pollution;
They must brook no opposition, 
Press ahead with plans for fission,
Hone their theocratic praxis--
And languish on the evil axis.
IN OTHER parts the breaking news, 
Of wars and bombs and avian flus,
Was little better, it appeared. 
True, some Italians rose and cheered
To hear a court say Berlusconi 
Must be tried, the law was phoney
That granted him immunity 
And so conferred impunity.
And down in Georgia Saakashvili, 
Young and brave, not touchy-feely,
Took every vote, bar 4%, 
And thus became the president.
ELSEWHERE, however, much was gloom. 
Darfur heard the crack of doom,
As every kind of odious deed 
Was turned to by the janjaweed. 
Oppression reigned from Minsk to Lhasa, 
A bomber killed herself in Gaza,
And men in shades in Pakistan 
Began to question Abdul Khan,
The father of the country's bomb, 
Who'd spread his secrets far from home.
A WORLD away, in cold Des Moines, 
By caucus, poll or well spun coin,
The Democrats began to choose 
A candidate who shared their views
And might do battle, later on--
The race would be a marathon,
Involving grit and shove and push--
With George (the latest) Walker Bush.
All eyes till now had focused been 
On pull-no-punches Howard Dean,
But Dean let out a plangent yell
That sent his ratings straight to hell,
And, with the voters not so sure, 
A new face was the cynosure.
John Forbes Kerry was his name 
And by month's end he'd shot to fame, 
A veteran with gongs galore 
And stinging words about the war.
Which war was that? Vietnam, of course, 
But now once more the use of force
In this new war was looking vain-- 
The war to fell Saddam Hussein.
Could Kerry wow the party hacks, 
And plug the Democratic cracks?
Was he Viagra? Polyfilla? 
An elixir? A dragon-killer?
Or just a boring flip-flop man? 
Political temazepam?
QUITE different questions troubled Tony, 
The aegis-bearing Bush's crony,
Whose faithful loyalty to his friend 
Had brought no favours in the end
And cost him dear within his party, 
Which threatened now to give him hearty
Thanks and hustle him to quit-- 
G. Brown could make a fist of it. 
Two horrors stalked the grinning Blair, 
One a pretty small affair
Involving top-up fees for students, 
Never known for showing prudence.
The other, though, concerned Iraq, 
In truth a matter deep and dark
In which the BBC had stated 
That Tony Blair had overrated--
""Sexed up"" was in fact the term--
A spooks' report about the germ
And ultra-nasty nuclear stuff 
That S. Hussein was braced to puff
In--this was a measure of his power--
Just three-quarters of an hour.
Many Brits disliked the war, 
The spin and lying even more, 
Especially the false deduction 
That the weapons were of mass destruction.
One man who'd told the Beeb his thought--
This was the source for its report--
Had then resorted to a knife 
To cut his wrist and take his life.
Six months had passed and now was due 
An independent full review 
In which a judge would soon proclaim 
If anyone should take the blame. 
Some thought that, having heard from Hutton, 
T. Blair would be as dead as mutton.
How wrong they were: when all was stated, 
It was the Beeb the judge berated.
IN FEB, the shortest month of all,
Iraq was still in Mars's thrall.
The world watched bombs and rockets fall, 
And hopes of peace could only pall,
Notwithstanding Wolfowitz.
DARFUR now was racked by hunger,
Sri Lanka hoped for someone younger
Than its boss, Kumaratunga,
Who, 'midst cries of ""Cowabunga!""
Sacked her colleagues, causing splits.
LIKEWISE Putin purged his team, 
Vowed to mine a richer seam.
Mugabe sank in world esteem--
His special powers made critics scream.
Zimbabwe was the pits.
FRANCE said it would ban the veil,
San Francisco it would hail
Same-sex weddings, male to male.
Gays who'd hoped they would prevail
Were putting on the Ritz.
UGANDAN cultists slaughtered 80,
Things were even worse in Haiti,
Nader said that every state he 
Would contest, thus leaving baity
Democrats in fits.
THE world dismissed th' Iranian poll, 
A bomb in Arbil took its toll,
Kerry's bus began to roll,
And viewers of the Super Bowl
Saw Janet Jackson's tits.
IN EAGERNESS, it now appeared, to live up to its name,
Mad March arrived in crazy style with lots more of the same:
In Karbala, in Quetta, La Paz and Tashkent, too, 
In Gaza and Fallujah--though not in Timbuktu--
Boom followed after bang, alas, bang followed thud,
The air was full of smoke and the streets were full of blood. 
But the worst bangs of all were the ones that shattered Spain,
Three days before a vote was due to put in place again 
The team once led, the Bushies said, by that bright shining star,
The champion of ""new"" Europe's crew, Jose Mara Aznar.
When he had sent Spain's soldiers to do battle in Iraq,
He hadn't given his reasons, but kept all his thinking dark. 
E'en so, the polls predicted that his team would win again,
But the voters didn't like the way that he and all his men
Were quick to blame the bombing on Spain's home-grown ETA camp,
When all the signs suggested that it bore al-Qaeda's stamp.
And so the Spaniards brought to book George Bush's friend and hero,
By opting for Jose Luis Rodrguez Zapatero.
BY CONTRAST, for some others, the votes were trouble-free;
Malaysia and El Salvador had rulers filled with glee.
The Taiwanese returned their boss, though only by a fraction,
While the other 49% demanded satisfaction. 
John Kerry drew more comfort from a Super Tuesday win,
His rivals, though, sustained a blow and saw their ranks grow thin.
Attempted coups would make the news in Congo and Sudan,
And Turkmenbashi banned all beards in Turkmenbashistan. 
THE South Korean president found solace out of reach 
When his parliament chastised him and then voted to impeach.
For North Koreans and Cypriots the talking came to naught, 
But with Muammar Qaddafi it all proved much less fraught.
In Pakistan the Indians had a jolly spiffing tour
Showing cricket could bring friendship to old enemies next door.
Events in Venezuela, though, were doomed to end in fracas--
Too bad that cricket isn't played in soccer-mad Caracas.
Too bad, as well, for Irishmen who liked to have a drag,
That now in every workplace the signs said ""Quench that fag"".
THE father of Muqtada 
Was a better man, they said,
Yet anyone called Sadr
Filled western hearts with dread.
Old Sadr was a scholar,
With a penchant for the book,
But the son was rather different
With a very nasty look. 
He could summon up his forces
From the centre of Najaf,
Or the slums of Sadr City
Where the streets were mean and tough.
Though the Sunnis of Fallujah
Might sometimes call a truce,
Muqtada thought the Shias
Should turn Bush's rednecks puce.
And so the spring was bloody 
In this ""liberated"" land,
Where the lights were intermittent
And the wells were clogged with sand.
THOUGH things were somewhat better
In the kingdom to the south--
You could not say the people here
Were living hand to mouth--
Yet a bomb went off in Riyadh
And re-echoed clear and loud
With a message that was meant to rock
The ruling house of Saud.
IN THE land between the Jordan
And the Mediterranean Sea,
The guardian of the Jewish state
Said Gaza might be free.
He vowed to pull the settlers 
From their Earthly bit of heaven.
The borders, though, would not be those
Of 1967. 
NO MATTER, said the White House;
It's an excellent idea.
A state we'll make in Palestine
With all its exiles there.
They can't go ""home"" to Israel--
That simply isn't on--
We'll leave it to the Likud
And dear Ariel Sharon.
BY CONTRAST, in Ilave,
A town in south Peru, 
Protesters tore the place apart
And lynched the mayor too.
A law in California 
To give workers compensation
Had brought the state to penury
Amid much consternation.
""Don't vorry, frendz, no need to fear
The budget it vill beggar;
Ve'll halve the cost of joblessness,""
Said Arnold Schwarzenegger.
WOULD in Iraq more mayhem come in May?
Yes, shots and rockets fell, and bombs galore.
But worse than this, the world was soon to say,
Worse than the ruin and bile and gore, 
Were pictures on the screen and in the press
Of hapless prisoners held in Abu Ghraib,
Recoiling from the unslipped dogs of war, 
And humbled in their awful nakedness-- 
Yet not by those who'd ruled this jail before,
But leering GI Joe and GI Joan, his babe.
WE TOLD you so, said Muslims far and wide,
""A failure of our leaders"" was th' official phrase.
Don Rumsfeld realised he must now decide
To go, which, pondering the matter for some days,
He did. But 'twas not from the Pentagon he hastened 
But to Iraq, responsible, he said,
For matters of ""enhanced interrogation""--
He did not care for ""torture lite""--and, seemingly unchastened,
Spoke of ""abuse"", but not of resignation:
Bad apples lower down were blamed instead.
A HAPPIER tale by far from India came
Where Sonia Gandhi's Congress from behind
Emerged to form a government and claim
Lok Sabha, though the top job she declined--
A politician bashful, it appeared, 
Despite Nehruvian lineage and lore.
Manmohan Singh the premiership assumed,
A market-friendly face whom no one feared.
The BJP its sorry self had doomed, 
With ""India shining"" calls for five years more.
THE EU welcomed ten more to its ranks.
Iran was going nuclear, folk said.
The rivers in Brazil all burst their banks.
Torrential rain left floods and thousands dead
In Haiti, which was also torn by strife.
Koizumi went to North Korea to find
The children of some Japanese once captured.
Rush Limbaugh said that he'd divorce his wife.
Darfur was looking trashed and badly fractured,
But no one now could bring themselves to mind.
THE bloodshed and violence continued to mount
In the land where Saddam had once reigned.
That the Yanks could breathe easy if they yielded power
Was the hope that they all entertained.
The date had been set for the end of the month,
For the new sovereign state to be born.
The handover came, with a slight hint of shame,
On an early, unadvertised morn.
THINGS weren't going much better for Bush back at home,
The top judges said he was wrong.
Guantnamo's inmates, they forthrightly ruled,
Had had rights to appeal all along.
To make matters worse, in the eyes of the world,
Was some evidence bound to displease,
That G. Bush's own men, with a stroke of the pen,
Had said ""Torture's OK overseas.""
And then from some sages there came a report
Saying no kind of link could be found
Between Saddam Hussein and the troglodyte men
Who had razed the Twin Towers to the ground.
BUT America now for a moment would pause
To reflect on a president late. 
Old antagonists all could agree not to call
Reagan anything other than great.
IN EUROPE, meanwhile, all the big cheeses met
To say yes to a new constitution.
Though for months they'd conferred, some critics demurred 
Amid vows to resist ""revolution"".
Most voters, however, to judge by the poll
For their pan-European talking-shop,
Had preferred to stay home, with a film or a tome,
Than this grandiose plan try to stop.
THE Philippine votes were all counted at last
And Arroyo was once more in power.
But no comeback for Bill, though kid Clinton could still
Pull crowds with a vapid memoir.
AS USUAL, however, the nastiest news
Was to come from the sad Middle East:
While cameras were steadied, two men were beheaded
And the tapes to the media released.
EUROPEANS, some at least, in years divisible by four,
Start July with sporting talk not just of cycling (yes, le tour),
Of Wimbledon (yes, ""Come on, Tim""), of cricket (who's that at the crease?),
But also, quadriennally, of football (no more summer peace--
Nil-nil, foul, expletive, ""Goal!""), a ghastly contest won by--Greece!
IF THAT, however, shook the bookies, no one now expressed surprise
That a senior Senate panel went to lengths to criticise
All the spooks and spies and experts, all of those who once had said
That Iraq was stuffed with weapons fit to fill the strong with dread;
Thanks to them, the panel noted, all the world had been misled.
IN BRITAIN, too, there was tut-tutting, as Lord Butler now laid bare
All the fibs and fabrications in the desperate drive to scare. 
MI6 had bungled badly, God knows how it made its claim
About those horrid, beastly weapons--golly, what a rotten shame!
Still, since the mess was all collective, no one really was to blame.
THAT'S the way New Labour likes it, so it seems, at any rate:
No one fails and all have prizes; simply blame the fourth estate.
Don't let's mention missing weapons, don't be cross, it's quite unfair.
All who acted acted nobly, good intentions everywhere.
Politicians don't say sorry, not Geoff Hoon or Tony Blair.
OTHER leaders had their problems, Europe's struggled to recruit
A chap to run the new commission, not, they hoped, a boring suit.
But half the names were controversial, and half again seemed pretty so-so,
Until they found a man at last, not at all malodoroso,
A Portuguese would fit the bill: Jose Manuel Duro Barroso.
FAR and wide, as voters voted, ruling parties took a hit.
In Canada the Liberals smarted, won but also lost a bit.
The Japanese were likewise vengeful, gave the government some knocks;
Mexico did something similar, taking aim at Mr Fox,
And his missus, so it seemed--all ambitions, airs and frocks.
AT THE HAGUE the World Court uttered, Israel's wall would never do;
We'll build on,"" th' Israelis answered, ""What's it got to do with you?""
Michael Moore was grossing millions, Kerry picked his running-mate.
Uncle Sam restored relations with a former terror state--
Libya was back in favour, Iran was now the place to hate.
FAR away, in Venezuela, 
August saw bold Chvez cheer.
Faces in the West turned paler,
As the poll results grew clear:
Six in ten had backed the colonel,
This would have results external,
For the price of oil was dear.
IN IRAQ the wells were pumping,
But the place was still at war;
In Najaf the joint was jumping,
Chaos reigned as ne'er before,
Till an aged ayatollah,
Who had long been hard to collar,
Sealed a deal to fight no more.
AT HIS trial for war-crimes vile,
Slobodan Milosevic
Was too ill, despite denial,
To conduct his legal pitch.
So two lawyers were appointed--
Perhaps their minds were double-jointed--
To defend the Serb's last ditch.
ANWAR IBRAHIM, a plucky
Prisoner in a Malay jail,
Six years on at last got lucky--
No one even asked for bail.
No such luck for Master Thatcher,
Nabbed inside his Cape Town dacha;
Protests were to no avail.
IN NEW YORK th' United Nations
Told the bloodstained Sudanese
Time was running out for patience:
Would they stop the killing, please?
But veto-wielding Mr Putin
Didn't want the UN boot in,
So Sudan would feel no squeeze.
WINDS swept through the Caribbean,
Olympic athletes strove in hope.
Only efforts Herculean
Could make Afghans give up dope.
Rebels flocked to Katmandu,
Chechens bombed a plane or two;
Could the Russians ever cope?
SEPTEMBER was here, and the winds now blew strong;
The trail of destruction grew horribly long.
East-coast America, Haiti and Cuba
Jamaica, Grenada and once-Dutch Aruba
Were hammered and battered by night and by day,
Their houses were flattened, if not blown away.
IN AFRICA, too, the disasters descended,
As locusts came down it seemed God was offended.
But the worst blows of all, as so often the case,
Were the blows meted out by our own human race.
And of these there were few that could ever compare
With the slaughter that opened the Russian school year.
THREE hundred children, perhaps many more,
When the classrooms were stormed were found dead on the floor.
Chechen guerrillas were plainly to blame,
But many thought Russia shared some of the shame
For badly mishandling the siege of a school
And repressing the Chechens who wanted home rule.
FOR benighted Iraqis things also were bad,
Bombs killed 30 children in central Baghdad.
The place will be peaceful, said Iyad Allawi,
But the script was now written by one al-Zarqawi,
A man often said by the pressmen embedded
To preside over hostages being beheaded.
SHARON'S plan for Gaza now looked like a starter,
A bomb killed eight people in central Jakarta.
In Land after Land German voters made plain
That they didn't care much for the thought of more pain;
But though plenty were ready to stick it to Schroder,
They equally hoped to put Merkel in purdah.
REFORMERS in Turkey now thought it was time
To make sex out of wedlock, if married, a crime.
The EU took umbrage and said, ""Not so fast,
If you want to join Europe this mustn't be passed.""
""OK,"" said the Turks, in the face of such flak,
And their talks for accession were put back on track.
NOW grey October galloped in apace,
Although the sun shone bright enough on some.
John Howard, down in Oz, ran quite a race
And left Mark Latham up a tree of gum.
The Afghans voted, too--it was a first--
And in a poll few thought would safely pass,
Though ballots oft were missing or dispersed,
They Karzai chose and thus escaped a farce.
The folk of Maharashtra, in their poll,
Rebuked the Hindu zealots all about;
The Indonesian voters, on the whole,
Chose cautious Yudhoyono in a rout.
But Serbs and Kosovars would still not mix,
So left their mutual province in a fix.
WHO now would speak for Europe in the world
And harmonise th' affairs of all its nations?
Barroso had his chosen list unfurled,
With faces matching all their future stations.
But one of them, named R. Buttiglione,
To parliament had aired views rather strange;
It said that they were bigoted baloney:
This member of the team he'd better change.
And so he now withdrew the whole commission.
Attention turned instead to hot-air blasts.
The Russians chose to end sins of emission,
And ratified that protocol at last.
This meant the number now reached 55--
Enough to keep Kyoto's dream alive.
GOOD news from France came when arrests were made
Of ETA leaders sought for crimes in Spain.
The word from Pitcairn left the world dismayed:
For years the island's girls had cried in vain
As male descendants of the Bounty's crew
Raped and abused them with no sense of shame.
Th' Iraqi news was sadly far less new,
Samarra was recaptured, but the name
Fallujah, fiercely resonant with awe,
Was now on every lip and trembling tongue.
The White House race towards its close did draw,
Debates were done, the final mud was slung.
With rival's records each played fast and loose;
Bush cut some taxes, Kerry shot a goose.
THE second of November and the morning of the vote,
The candidates seemed neck and neck and not inclined to gloat.
By midnight, though, it all was clear, the prize had gone to Bush,
The hammer of Saddam Hussein, Iran, the Hindu Kush.
A warrior the voters chose, a man to love and dread,
A Christian, a patriot, who'd paint the country red.
AND red indeed it looked next day: both Senate and the House,
Were redder than the day before, the Democrats would grouse.
Moreover, in 11 states the fate of marriage gay
Had fallen foul of prejudice and men like Tom DeLay,
Who'd mashed the map of Texas, despite the protests heard,
With help from one Bush liked to call the Blossom of the Turd.
THE time had come, apparently, to make the good times roll,
The cabinet was winnowed and they said goodbye to Powell.
He'd hardly dared leave Washington for fear that in a trice
Old Rummy would outsmart him, so bring on Condi Rice.
With the CIA in chaos and Bill Rehnquist looking sick,
George Bush could now prepare to cure the body politic.
THE place most sorely wounded, though, was bleeding at the seams;
'Twas time to zap Fallujah and to hell with all the screams.
Iraq was due to hold a vote within just 80 days;
The way to spread democracy was bomb and blast and blaze--
Insurgents, you'll appreciate, not plain Iraqis good.
Too bad if some poor innocents may not have understood.
THE Arab world then drew a breath to praise dead Arafat,
And wonder who might now take o'er the group that he begat.
The Dutch all froze in horror at a murder foul and wild
Of a man who'd made a movie that had many Muslims riled.
West Africans in Cote d'Ivoire were turning on the French
And torture tales of Pinochet made many a Chilean blench.
TO BATTEN down a hatred some thought was quite primordial,
Jacques Chirac came to England and thus kept the entente cordial.
A group of wise reformers tried to mend some UN fences.
A Homo hitherto unknown was named floresiensis:
She lived 12,000 years ago and stood just three feet tall,
Her teeth were worn with munching and her brain was rather small. 
AN ACID memorandum from the Red Cross came to light
Saying techniques in Guantnamo were really far from right.
And meanwhile an election rent the floundering Ukraine,
Whose streets were thronged with people, all clamouring in vain.
And down in Foggy Bottom the man so long ignored
Decided that he now had time to take a trip abroad.
IN PRE-ELECTION Britain there was war on every front;
The Lords and Commons clashed over huntsmen's right to hunt.
Pink coats were sent a-packing, the countryside was cross,
But the Commons was determined to show that it was boss.
If this was freedom's test, then the government would flunk it;
But never mind, all eyes were on the love-lorn Mr Blunkett.
AND so the year was almost out,
December had begun.
Ukraine was going down the spout:
Both Victors thought they'd won.
But then the court said, ""Vote once more,
On Boxing Day."" Was that a bore?
No, more a shaft of sun.
A VOTE took place in Mozambique.
In France old Juppe crowed:
A judge gave him the right to seek
The presidential road.
Sarkozy will be miffed, they thought,
To face this man from Chirac's court,
When Jacques puts down his load.
THE world had changed, 'twas plain to see,
And yet it was the same
For those with AIDS or HIV--
Few comforts for them came.
Five million more were virus-cursed,
And seven times that already nursed
This incubus of shame.
UP NORTH rich folk would now decry
The rising price of oil,
The dollar low or euro high,
And housing off the boil.
Third-worlders, though, were used to pain--
Another year and little gain, 
Another year of toil.
WOULD next year any better be 
Than this year gone before?
Would peace illumine January,
Or would it be more war?
Would sun shine down and flowers bloom?
Or would there be a hecatomb?
We do not know, that's sure.
FOR now we must content ourselves
With Spiderman and Shrek,
With red-nosed deer and little elves,
And hollied halls to deck.
If Father Christmas wishes well,
The world won't just yet go to hell,
Though it may look a wreck.",230,Spain,"The world's events we here rehearse--The year that's passed is told in verse

That in his place was GI Joe,

Of wars and bombs and avian flus,

Darfur heard the crack of doom,

With George (the latest) Walker Bush.
All eyes till now had focused been 
On pull-no-punches Howard Dean,
But Dean let out a plangent yell
That sent his ratings straight to hell,
And, with the voters not so sure, 
A new face was the cynosure.
John Forbes Kerry was his name 
And by month's end he'd shot to fame, 
A veteran with gongs galore 
And stinging words about the war.
Which war was that? Vietnam, of course, 
But now once more the use of force
In this new war was looking vain-- 
The war to fell Saddam Hussein.
Could Kerry wow the party hacks, 
And plug the Democratic cracks?
Was he Viagra? Polyfilla? 
An elixir? A dragon-killer?
Or just a boring flip-flop man? 
Political temazepam?
QUITE different questions troubled Tony, 
The aegis-bearing Bush's crony,
Whose faithful loyalty to his friend 
Had brought no favours in the end
And cost him dear within his party, 
Which threatened now to give him hearty
Thanks and hustle him to quit-- 
G. Brown could make a fist of it. 
Two horrors stalked the grinning Blair, 
One a pretty small affair
Involving top-up fees for students, 
Never known for showing prudence.
The other, though, concerned Iraq, 
In truth a matter deep and dark
In which the BBC had stated 
That Tony Blair had overrated--
""Sexed up"" was in fact the term--
A spooks' report about the germ
And ultra-nasty nuclear stuff 
That S. Hussein was braced to puff
In--this was a measure of his power--
Just three-quarters of an hour.
Many Brits disliked the war, 
The spin and lying even more, 
Especially the false deduction 
That the weapons were of mass destruction.
One man who'd told the Beeb his thought--
This was the source for its report--
Had then resorted to a knife 
To cut his wrist and take his life.
Six months had passed and now was due 
An independent full review 
In which a judge would soon proclaim 
If anyone should take the blame. 
Some thought that, having heard from Hutton, 
T. Blair would be as dead as mutton.
How wrong they were: when all was stated, 
It was the Beeb the judge berated.
IN FEB, the shortest month of all,
Iraq was still in Mars's thrall.
The world watched bombs and rockets fall, 
And hopes of peace could only pall,
Notwithstanding Wolfowitz.
DARFUR now was racked by hunger,
Sri Lanka hoped for someone younger
Than its boss, Kumaratunga,
Who, 'midst cries of ""Cowabunga!""
Sacked her colleagues, causing splits.
LIKEWISE Putin purged his team, 
Vowed to mine a richer seam.
Mugabe sank in world esteem--
His special powers made critics scream.
Zimbabwe was the pits.
FRANCE said it would ban the veil,
San Francisco it would hail
Same-sex weddings, male to male.
Gays who'd hoped they would prevail
Were putting on the Ritz.
UGANDAN cultists slaughtered 80,
Things were even worse in Haiti,
Nader said that every state he 
Would contest, thus leaving baity
Democrats in fits.
THE world dismissed th' Iranian poll, 
A bomb in Arbil took its toll,
Kerry's bus began to roll,
And viewers of the Super Bowl
Saw Janet Jackson's tits.
IN EAGERNESS, it now appeared, to live up to its name,
Mad March arrived in crazy style with lots more of the same:
In Karbala, in Quetta, La Paz and Tashkent, too, 
In Gaza and Fallujah--though not in Timbuktu--
Boom followed after bang, alas, bang followed thud,
The air was full of smoke and the streets were full of blood. 
But the worst bangs of all were the ones that shattered Spain,
Three days before a vote was due to put in place again 
The team once led, the Bushies said, by that bright shining star,
The champion of ""new"" Europe's crew, Jose Mara Aznar.
When he had sent Spain's soldiers to do battle in Iraq,
He hadn't given his reasons, but kept all his thinking dark. 
E'en so, the polls predicted that his team would win again,
But the voters didn't like the way that he and all his men
Were quick to blame the bombing on Spain's home-grown ETA camp,
When all the signs suggested that it bore al-Qaeda's stamp.
And so the Spaniards brought to book George Bush's friend and hero,
By opting for Jose Luis Rodrguez Zapatero.
BY CONTRAST, for some others, the votes were trouble-free;
Malaysia and El Salvador had rulers filled with glee.
The Taiwanese returned their boss, though only by a fraction,
While the other 49% demanded satisfaction. 
John Kerry drew more comfort from a Super Tuesday win,
His rivals, though, sustained a blow and saw their ranks grow thin.
Attempted coups would make the news in Congo and Sudan,
And Turkmenbashi banned all beards in Turkmenbashistan. 
THE South Korean president found solace out of reach 
When his parliament chastised him and then voted to impeach.
For North Koreans and Cypriots the talking came to naught, 
But with Muammar Qaddafi it all proved much less fraught.
In Pakistan the Indians had a jolly spiffing tour
Showing cricket could bring friendship to old enemies next door.
Events in Venezuela, though, were doomed to end in fracas--
Too bad that cricket isn't played in soccer-mad Caracas.
Too bad, as well, for Irishmen who liked to have a drag,
That now in every workplace the signs said ""Quench that fag"".
THE father of Muqtada 
Was a better man, they said,
Yet anyone called Sadr
Filled western hearts with dread.
Old Sadr was a scholar,
With a penchant for the book,
But the son was rather different
With a very nasty look. 
He could summon up his forces
From the centre of Najaf,
Or the slums of Sadr City
Where the streets were mean and tough.
Though the Sunnis of Fallujah
Might sometimes call a truce,
Muqtada thought the Shias
Should turn Bush's rednecks puce.
And so the spring was bloody 
In this ""liberated"" land,
Where the lights were intermittent
And the wells were clogged with sand.
THOUGH things were somewhat better
In the kingdom to the south--
You could not say the people here
Were living hand to mouth--
Yet a bomb went off in Riyadh
And re-echoed clear and loud
With a message that was meant to rock
The ruling house of Saud.
IN THE land between the Jordan
And the Mediterranean Sea,
The guardian of the Jewish state
Said Gaza might be free.
He vowed to pull the settlers 
From their Earthly bit of heaven.
The borders, though, would not be those
Of 1967. 
NO MATTER, said the White House;
It's an excellent idea.
A state we'll make in Palestine
With all its exiles there.
They can't go ""home"" to Israel--
That simply isn't on--
We'll leave it to the Likud
And dear Ariel Sharon.
BY CONTRAST, in Ilave,
A town in south Peru, 
Protesters tore the place apart
And lynched the mayor too.
A law in California 
To give workers compensation
Had brought the state to penury
Amid much consternation.
""Don't vorry, frendz, no need to fear
The budget it vill beggar;
Ve'll halve the cost of joblessness,""
Said Arnold Schwarzenegger.
WOULD in Iraq more mayhem come in May?
Yes, shots and rockets fell, and bombs galore.
But worse than this, the world was soon to say,
Worse than the ruin and bile and gore, 
Were pictures on the screen and in the press
Of hapless prisoners held in Abu Ghraib,
Recoiling from the unslipped dogs of war, 
And humbled in their awful nakedness-- 
Yet not by those who'd ruled this jail before,
But leering GI Joe and GI Joan, his babe.
WE TOLD you so, said Muslims far and wide,
""A failure of our leaders"" was th' official phrase.
Don Rumsfeld realised he must now decide
To go, which, pondering the matter for some days,
He did. But 'twas not from the Pentagon he hastened 
But to Iraq, responsible, he said,
For matters of ""enhanced interrogation""--
He did not care for ""torture lite""--and, seemingly unchastened,
Spoke of ""abuse"", but not of resignation:
Bad apples lower down were blamed instead.
A HAPPIER tale by far from India came
Where Sonia Gandhi's Congress from behind
Emerged to form a government and claim
Lok Sabha, though the top job she declined--
A politician bashful, it appeared, 
Despite Nehruvian lineage and lore.
Manmohan Singh the premiership assumed,
A market-friendly face whom no one feared.
The BJP its sorry self had doomed, 
With ""India shining"" calls for five years more.
THE EU welcomed ten more to its ranks.
Iran was going nuclear, folk said.
The rivers in Brazil all burst their banks.
Torrential rain left floods and thousands dead
In Haiti, which was also torn by strife.
Koizumi went to North Korea to find
The children of some Japanese once captured.
Rush Limbaugh said that he'd divorce his wife.
Darfur was looking trashed and badly fractured,
But no one now could bring themselves to mind.
THE bloodshed and violence continued to mount
In the land where Saddam had once reigned.
That the Yanks could breathe easy if they yielded power
Was the hope that they all entertained.
The date had been set for the end of the month,
For the new sovereign state to be born.
The handover came, with a slight hint of shame,
On an early, unadvertised morn.
THINGS weren't going much better for Bush back at home,
The top judges said he was wrong.
Guantnamo's inmates, they forthrightly ruled,
Had had rights to appeal all along.
To make matters worse, in the eyes of the world,
Was some evidence bound to displease,
That G. Bush's own men, with a stroke of the pen,
Had said ""Torture's OK overseas.""
And then from some sages there came a report
Saying no kind of link could be found
Between Saddam Hussein and the troglodyte men
Who had razed the Twin Towers to the ground.
BUT America now for a moment would pause
To reflect on a president late. 
Old antagonists all could agree not to call
Reagan anything other than great.
IN EUROPE, meanwhile, all the big cheeses met
To say yes to a new constitution.
Though for months they'd conferred, some critics demurred 
Amid vows to resist ""revolution"".
Most voters, however, to judge by the poll
For their pan-European talking-shop,
Had preferred to stay home, with a film or a tome,
Than this grandiose plan try to stop.
THE Philippine votes were all counted at last
And Arroyo was once more in power.
But no comeback for Bill, though kid Clinton could still
Pull crowds with a vapid memoir.
AS USUAL, however, the nastiest news
Was to come from the sad Middle East:
While cameras were steadied, two men were beheaded
And the tapes to the media released.
EUROPEANS, some at least, in years divisible by four,
Start July with sporting talk not just of cycling (yes, le tour),
Of Wimbledon (yes, ""Come on, Tim""), of cricket (who's that at the crease?),
But also, quadriennally, of football (no more summer peace--
Nil-nil, foul, expletive, ""Goal!""), a ghastly contest won by--Greece!
IF THAT, however, shook the bookies, no one now expressed surprise
That a senior Senate panel went to lengths to criticise
All the spooks and spies and experts, all of those who once had said
That Iraq was stuffed with weapons fit to fill the strong with dread;
Thanks to them, the panel noted, all the world had been misled.
IN BRITAIN, too, there was tut-tutting, as Lord Butler now laid bare
All the fibs and fabrications in the desperate drive to scare. 
MI6 had bungled badly, God knows how it made its claim
About those horrid, beastly weapons--golly, what a rotten shame!
Still, since the mess was all collective, no one really was to blame.
THAT'S the way New Labour likes it, so it seems, at any rate:
No one fails and all have prizes; simply blame the fourth estate.
Don't let's mention missing weapons, don't be cross, it's quite unfair.
All who acted acted nobly, good intentions everywhere.
Politicians don't say sorry, not Geoff Hoon or Tony Blair.
OTHER leaders had their problems, Europe's struggled to recruit
A chap to run the new commission, not, they hoped, a boring suit.
But half the names were controversial, and half again seemed pretty so-so,
Until they found a man at last, not at all malodoroso,
A Portuguese would fit the bill: Jose Manuel Duro Barroso.
FAR and wide, as voters voted, ruling parties took a hit.
In Canada the Liberals smarted, won but also lost a bit.
The Japanese were likewise vengeful, gave the government some knocks;
Mexico did something similar, taking aim at Mr Fox,
And his missus, so it seemed--all ambitions, airs and frocks.
AT THE HAGUE the World Court uttered, Israel's wall would never do;
We'll build on,"" th' Israelis answered, ""What's it got to do with you?""
Michael Moore was grossing millions, Kerry picked his running-mate.
Uncle Sam restored relations with a former terror state--
Libya was back in favour, Iran was now the place to hate.
FAR away, in Venezuela, 
August saw bold Chvez cheer.
Faces in the West turned paler,
As the poll results grew clear:
Six in ten had backed the colonel,
This would have results external,
For the price of oil was dear.
IN IRAQ the wells were pumping,
But the place was still at war;
In Najaf the joint was jumping,
Chaos reigned as ne'er before,
Till an aged ayatollah,
Who had long been hard to collar,
Sealed a deal to fight no more.
AT HIS trial for war-crimes vile,
Slobodan Milosevic
Was too ill, despite denial,
To conduct his legal pitch.
So two lawyers were appointed--
Perhaps their minds were double-jointed--
To defend the Serb's last ditch.
ANWAR IBRAHIM, a plucky
Prisoner in a Malay jail,
Six years on at last got lucky--
No one even asked for bail.
No such luck for Master Thatcher,
Nabbed inside his Cape Town dacha;
Protests were to no avail.
IN NEW YORK th' United Nations
Told the bloodstained Sudanese
Time was running out for patience:
Would they stop the killing, please?
But veto-wielding Mr Putin
Didn't want the UN boot in,
So Sudan would feel no squeeze.
WINDS swept through the Caribbean,
Olympic athletes strove in hope.
Only efforts Herculean
Could make Afghans give up dope.
Rebels flocked to Katmandu,
Chechens bombed a plane or two;
Could the Russians ever cope?
SEPTEMBER was here, and the winds now blew strong;
The trail of destruction grew horribly long.
East-coast America, Haiti and Cuba
Jamaica, Grenada and once-Dutch Aruba
Were hammered and battered by night and by day,
Their houses were flattened, if not blown away.
IN AFRICA, too, the disasters descended,
As locusts came down it seemed God was offended.
But the worst blows of all, as so often the case,
Were the blows meted out by our own human race.
And of these there were few that could ever compare
With the slaughter that opened the Russian school year.
THREE hundred children, perhaps many more,
When the classrooms were stormed were found dead on the floor.
Chechen guerrillas were plainly to blame,
But many thought Russia shared some of the shame
For badly mishandling the siege of a school
And repressing the Chechens who wanted home rule.
FOR benighted Iraqis things also were bad,
Bombs killed 30 children in central Baghdad.
The place will be peaceful, said Iyad Allawi,
But the script was now written by one al-Zarqawi,
A man often said by the pressmen embedded
To preside over hostages being beheaded.
SHARON'S plan for Gaza now looked like a starter,
A bomb killed eight people in central Jakarta.
In Land after Land German voters made plain
That they didn't care much for the thought of more pain;
But though plenty were ready to stick it to Schroder,
They equally hoped to put Merkel in purdah.
REFORMERS in Turkey now thought it was time
To make sex out of wedlock, if married, a crime.
The EU took umbrage and said, ""Not so fast,
If you want to join Europe this mustn't be passed.""
""OK,"" said the Turks, in the face of such flak,
And their talks for accession were put back on track.
NOW grey October galloped in apace,
Although the sun shone bright enough on some.
John Howard, down in Oz, ran quite a race
And left Mark Latham up a tree of gum.
The Afghans voted, too--it was a first--
And in a poll few thought would safely pass,
Though ballots oft were missing or dispersed,
They Karzai chose and thus escaped a farce.
The folk of Maharashtra, in their poll,
Rebuked the Hindu zealots all about;
The Indonesian voters, on the whole,
Chose cautious Yudhoyono in a rout.
But Serbs and Kosovars would still not mix,
So left their mutual province in a fix.
WHO now would speak for Europe in the world
And harmonise th' affairs of all its nations?
Barroso had his chosen list unfurled,
With faces matching all their future stations.
But one of them, named R. Buttiglione,
To parliament had aired views rather strange;
It said that they were bigoted baloney:
This member of the team he'd better change.
And so he now withdrew the whole commission.
Attention turned instead to hot-air blasts.
The Russians chose to end sins of emission,
And ratified that protocol at last.
This meant the number now reached 55--
Enough to keep Kyoto's dream alive.
GOOD news from France came when arrests were made
Of ETA leaders sought for crimes in Spain.
The word from Pitcairn left the world dismayed:
For years the island's girls had cried in vain
As male descendants of the Bounty's crew
Raped and abused them with no sense of shame.
Th' Iraqi news was sadly far less new,
Samarra was recaptured, but the name
Fallujah, fiercely resonant with awe,
Was now on every lip and trembling tongue.
The White House race towards its close did draw,
Debates were done, the final mud was slung.
With rival's records each played fast and loose;
Bush cut some taxes, Kerry shot a goose.
THE second of November and the morning of the vote,
The candidates seemed neck and neck and not inclined to gloat.
By midnight, though, it all was clear, the prize had gone to Bush,
The hammer of Saddam Hussein, Iran, the Hindu Kush.
A warrior the voters chose, a man to love and dread,
A Christian, a patriot, who'd paint the country red.
AND red indeed it looked next day: both Senate and the House,
Were redder than the day before, the Democrats would grouse.
Moreover, in 11 states the fate of marriage gay
Had fallen foul of prejudice and men like Tom DeLay,
Who'd mashed the map of Texas, despite the protests heard,
With help from one Bush liked to call the Blossom of the Turd.
THE time had come, apparently, to make the good times roll,
The cabinet was winnowed and they said goodbye to Powell.
He'd hardly dared leave Washington for fear that in a trice
Old Rummy would outsmart him, so bring on Condi Rice.
With the CIA in chaos and Bill Rehnquist looking sick,
George Bush could now prepare to cure the body politic.
THE place most sorely wounded, though, was bleeding at the seams;
'Twas time to zap Fallujah and to hell with all the screams.
Iraq was due to hold a vote within just 80 days;
The way to spread democracy was bomb and blast and blaze--
Insurgents, you'll appreciate, not plain Iraqis good.
Too bad if some poor innocents may not have understood.
THE Arab world then drew a breath to praise dead Arafat,
And wonder who might now take o'er the group that he begat.
The Dutch all froze in horror at a murder foul and wild
Of a man who'd made a movie that had many Muslims riled.
West Africans in Cote d'Ivoire were turning on the French
And torture tales of Pinochet made many a Chilean blench.
TO BATTEN down a hatred some thought was quite primordial,
Jacques Chirac came to England and thus kept the entente cordial.
A group of wise reformers tried to mend some UN fences.
A Homo hitherto unknown was named floresiensis:
She lived 12,000 years ago and stood just three feet tall,
Her teeth were worn with munching and her brain was rather small. 
AN ACID memorandum from the Red Cross came to light
Saying techniques in Guantnamo were really far from right.
And meanwhile an election rent the floundering Ukraine,
Whose streets were thronged with people, all clamouring in vain.
And down in Foggy Bottom the man so long ignored
Decided that he now had time to take a trip abroad.
IN PRE-ELECTION Britain there was war on every front;
The Lords and Commons clashed over huntsmen's right to hunt.
Pink coats were sent a-packing, the countryside was cross,
But the Commons was determined to show that it was boss.
If this was freedom's test, then the government would flunk it;
But never mind, all eyes were on the love-lorn Mr Blunkett.
AND so the year was almost out,
December had begun.
Ukraine was going down the spout:
Both Victors thought they'd won.
But then the court said, ""Vote once more,
On Boxing Day."" Was that a bore?
No, more a shaft of sun.
A VOTE took place in Mozambique.
In France old Juppe crowed:
A judge gave him the right to seek
The presidential road.
Sarkozy will be miffed, they thought,
To face this man from Chirac's court,
When Jacques puts down his load.
THE world had changed, 'twas plain to see,
And yet it was the same
For those with AIDS or HIV--
Few comforts for them came.
Five million more were virus-cursed,
And seven times that already nursed
This incubus of shame.
UP NORTH rich folk would now decry
The rising price of oil,
The dollar low or euro high,
And housing off the boil.
Third-worlders, though, were used to pain--
Another year and little gain, 
Another year of toil.
WOULD next year any better be 
Than this year gone before?
Would peace illumine January,
Or would it be more war?
Would sun shine down and flowers bloom?
Or would there be a hecatomb?
We do not know, that's sure.
FOR now we must content ourselves
With Spiderman and Shrek,
With red-nosed deer and little elves,
And hollied halls to deck.
If Father Christmas wishes well,
The world won't just yet go to hell,
Though it may look a wreck.",True

The confirmed death toll from Asia's tsunami rose to about 150,000, with thousands still missing. Aid workers had yet to reach all of Aceh, the northern tip of Indonesia's island of Sumatra, and several of India's badly hit Andaman and Nicobar islands. But in most afflicted parts, in Sri Lanka and Thailand as well as Indonesia and India, vast quantities of relief aid were beginning to reach survivors. World leaders attended a disaster summit in Jakarta. Some $4 billion has been promised so far.

The insurgency in Iraq may be worsening in the run-up to a general election on January 30th, with nearly 70 Iraqi policemen, national guardsmen and security forces killed since the new year, along with at least eight Americans. The provincial governor of Baghdad was assassinated, the highest-ranking victim for eight months. Though Iraq's president, Ghazi al-Yawar, the most senior Sunni Arab official, suggested that the UN should decide whether to postpone the election, the interim prime minister, Iyad Allawi, insisted it be held on time. 
Iraq's intelligence minister said there were now more insurgents--some 200,000, he guessed, of whom he deemed 40,000 ""hard core""--operating against 150,000-odd American troops. 
Jordan hosted a conference of Iraq's neighbours to promote support for the election. Iran's foreign minister stayed away, after Jordan's King Abdullah had accused Iran of meddling in the campaign.
Israel's United Torah Judaism, an orthodox group with five seats in parliament, decided to join Ariel Sharon's Likud party and Shimon Peres's Labour party in a government coalition pledged to achieve the withdrawal, probably this summer, of Israeli forces and Jewish settlers from the Gaza strip. Meanwhile, opinion pollsters said that Mahmoud Abbas (also known as Abu Mazen) seemed set to win the Palestinian presidential election on January 9th.
The International Atomic Energy Agency, the UN's nuclear watchdog, has found evidence of secret nuclear experiments in Egypt, according to western diplomats. Most were said to have been carried out in the 1980s and 1990s, but the IAEA was reported to be looking at evidence that some research was conducted only a year ago. The Egyptian government said its nuclear programme was peaceful.
A comprehensive peace treaty between the Sudanese government and southerners who have for two decades been seeking autonomy (or more) came closer after talks in Kenya, while separatists in Senegal's Casamance region also struck a deal with the central government in Dakar. But a hoped-for accord between the Lord's Resistance Army in the north of Uganda and the country's government fell apart.

President Jacques Chirac announced that France's referendum on the European Union's draft constitution will be held before the summer--probably in June. 
Croatia's presidential election will go to a second round on January 16th, after the incumbent, Stipe Mesic, narrowly failed to win the 50% majority required in the first round on January 2nd. Two days later the foreign minister, Miomir Zuzul, resigned after accusations of involvement in a bribery scandal.
Spain's prime minister, Jose Luis Rodrguez Zapatero, said that a plan by the Basque region to put its independence to a vote violated the country's constitution. The Basque parliament intends to press ahead.
Russia's president, Vladimir Putin, dismissed his top economic adviser, Andrei Illarionov, as his personal representative for G8 summit preparations, after Mr Illarionov criticised the forced sale of the oil assets of Yukos as the ""swindle of the year"".
Latin dance tragedy
In Buenos Aires, Argentina's capital, a fire in a dance hall killed at least 186 people, most of them teenagers. The fire began when concert-goers threw flares. Grieving relatives marched to demand the resignation of the city's mayor, Anbal Ibarra. 
Augusto Pinochet, Chile's former dictator, was placed under house arrest after the country's Supreme Court ruled that he could be tried on charges of murder and kidnapping, rejecting defence arguments that the elderly general was unfit to face trial because of dementia.
Four policemen and two rebels were killed when 150 armed supporters of an ultra-nationalist movement seized a police station in a town in Peru's southern Andes, calling for Alejandro Toledo, the country's democratic president, to resign. Their leader was arrested after talks with a government emissary. 
Colombia's government extradited Simn Trinidad, a leader of the FARC guerrilla group, to the United States, where he faces charges of drug trafficking and kidnapping Americans. The FARC had rejected an offer by President lvaro Uribe not to extradite Mr Trinidad if the group agreed to talks aimed at freeing several hundred hostages. 
A farm in Alberta was quarantined after two cases of BSE were discovered. The United States Department of Agriculture said the cases of mad-cow disease would not affect its plan to lift in March a ban on the import of Canadian beef imposed after a BSE case two years ago.
Torture practice
America's Justice Department published a memo expanding its definition of what constitutes torture, calling the practice ""abhorrent to American law and values"". Alberto Gonzales, the White House's chief legal counsel and George Bush's choice as the next attorney-general, commissioned a previous memo that restricted the definition of torture.
William Rehnquist, the ailing chief justice of America's Supreme Court, raised concerns about the independence of federal judges, suggesting that they need to be protected from threats of impeachment if they make decisions that are politically unpopular.

Latin dance tragedy

Augusto Pinochet, Chile's former dictator, was placed under house arrest after the country's Supreme Court ruled that he could be tried on charges of murder and kidnapping, rejecting defence arguments that the elderly general was unfit to face trial because of dementia.
Four policemen and two rebels were killed when 150 armed supporters of an ultra-nationalist movement seized a police station in a town in Peru's southern Andes, calling for Alejandro Toledo, the country's democratic president, to resign. Their leader was arrested after talks with a government emissary. 
Colombia's government extradited Simn Trinidad, a leader of the FARC guerrilla group, to the United States, where he faces charges of drug trafficking and kidnapping Americans. The FARC had rejected an offer by President lvaro Uribe not to extradite Mr Trinidad if the group agreed to talks aimed at freeing several hundred hostages. 
A farm in Alberta was quarantined after two cases of BSE were discovered. The United States Department of Agriculture said the cases of mad-cow disease would not affect its plan to lift in March a ban on the import of Canadian beef imposed after a BSE case two years ago.
Torture practice
America's Justice Department published a memo expanding its definition of what constitutes torture, calling the practice ""abhorrent to American law and values"". Alberto Gonzales, the White House's chief legal counsel and George Bush's choice as the next attorney-general, commissioned a previous memo that restricted the definition of torture.
William Rehnquist, the ailing chief justice of America's Supreme Court, raised concerns about the independence of federal judges, suggesting that they need to be protected from threats of impeachment if they make decisions that are politically unpopular.

SO FAR this month, the new year talk in Spain has been mostly of constitutional crisis. In Madrid there are dark mutterings about the disintegration of the state. The king and the bishops have pontificated on the sanctity of the constitution. And Spain's defence minister, Jose Bono, has issued a blunt warning that ""no territory may engage in projects which violate the sovereign will of all Spaniards."" 
The fuss began after the Basque parliament voted on December 30th to approve the Ibarretxe plan (named after the regional premier, Juan Jose Ibarretxe), which seeks to redefine relationships with Madrid and provide for a possible referendum on becoming ""a free state associated with Spain"". The vote for the plan was won only after a last-minute U-turn by three deputies from Batasuna (now called Sozialista Abertzaleak), the banned political wing of the ETA terrorist group. Batasuna had said the plan did not go far enough. By changing his mind, Batasuna's leader, Arnaldo Otegi, who controls seven seats that were won when the party was legal, wrong-footed Mr Ibarretxe's own moderate Basque Nationalist Party.
To the disgust of most of his parliamentary audience, Mr Otegi justified his change of heart by reading out a letter from a fugitive ETA leader (and Batasuna deputy), Jose Urrutikoetxea Bengoetxea, backing the plan for a referendum. Mr Ibarretxe had pledged that he would not rely on Batasuna support to push his plan through. Spaniards are now angry that it was passed with the help of ""three votes stained with blood"". Yet Mr Ibarretxe points out that both the Socialists and the People's Party (PP) have in the past used Batasuna's votes to block his budgets.
Whatever happens next, many in Madrid as well as the Basque country think the 25-year-old statute on the regions must now change. Mr Ibarretxe has asked a parliamentary commission to negotiate a new statute, as it did in 1979. Mariano Rajoy, the PP leader, called his plan ""the biggest challenge to national unity since 1978"". Even the prime minister, Jose Luis Rodrguez Zapatero, said it was secessionist, unconstitutional and incompatible with a Europe seeking to give up frontiers. He has ruled out government-to-government negotiations.
At first Mr Zapatero drew criticism for saying that the plan would be stopped at the ballot box, referring to Basque regional elections that are likely to be held in May. A mistake, opined an editorial in El Pas, as it ""tends to favour the nationalists' aim of converting the upcoming elections into a plebiscite on the Ibarretxe plan."" The plan was to be presented to the Spanish parliament, the Cortes, at the end of this week. The PP is asking the constitutional court to overturn a parliamentary ruling allowing a debate at all; if it fails, a debate may be held in March. 
Mr Ibarretxe, who also met Mr Zapatero late this week, has in the past played down the more controversial elements of his plan, promising that it does not aim at independence and that no unilateral steps would be taken. But he has now changed his tune. He wants the plan debated in the Cortes. If it fails there, as is likely, he has added a threat: ""I am not putting in doubt the legitimacy of any institutions, but the will of Basque society will not be supplanted by any other will.""
Mr Zapatero has called for calm, promising that the plan will be defeated in the Cortes, and that only if Mr Ibarretxe presses ahead with an illegal referendum will it go to court. Doom-mongers talk of invoking article 155 of the constitution, dissolving the regional governments. Mr Ibarretxe has also said that there must be an ETA ceasefire before any referendum. 
Mr Zapatero's woes are exacerbated by his minority government's dependence on the votes of the nationalist Catalan Republican Left (ERC) party. The ERC is threatening that, if the government says no to the Ibarretxe plan, it will withdraw support, bringing the government down. Yet some critics fear that Mr Zapatero's non-confrontational approach may embolden Catalan nationalists who want a new regional statute too. ""The battle against the plan Ibarretxe is going to be long, at least a year in duration,"" says the public administration minister, Jordi Sevilla.

PRINCE CHARLES, heir to the British throne, spends a lot of time on earnest attempts to influence public policy. But he has never, so far, had the dramatic impact of his younger son, Prince Harry, whose decision to wear a Nazi uniform to a fancy-dress party in Britain may be about to trigger Europe-wide legislation. Franco Frattini, the European Union's commissioner for justice and home affairs, declared to Italian newspapers this week that ""EU action is urgent and has to forbid very clearly Nazi symbols in the European Union.""
Indeed, Mr Frattini plans to put the idea of such a ban on the agenda of the next meeting of European justice ministers, on January 27th. Since that is also the day on which 40 world leaders will be gathered at Auschwitz to commemorate the liberation of the Nazi concentration camp in 1945, the chances of the EU seizing the opportunity to make a grand gesture must be high. But legislation passed at moments of high emotion is rarely well considered--and an EU-wide ban on Nazi symbols would be no exception to this rule.
The obvious problem with any such laws is where to draw the line. Do you just ban symbols, or do you also ban such offences as ""Holocaust denial""? And although almost everybody may agree that Nazism was a unique evil, a ban on Nazi symbols would undoubtedly lead to a call for other similar bans. Why not a ban on the Soviet hammer-and-sickle? Or one on fascist insignia in Spain or Italy? 
The issue is particularly perplexing in Mr Frattini's native Italy. Brussels-based journalists who visited the country during the Italian presidency of the EU in 2003 were startled to find Mussolini's photograph still affixed to the wall of the Palazzo Chigi, the official residence of the Italian prime minister, alongside photos of Italy's innumerable other prime ministers--and with no suggestion that there was anything remarkable about it. An official who was asked why a fascist dictator was still accorded this honour shrugged that ""he's part of our history.""
He is a part of Italy's present too. The deputy prime minister (and now foreign minister) whom the journalists were ushered in to see was none other than Gianfranco Fini, who in 1994 described Mussolini as ""the greatest statesman of the 20th century"". Mr Fini has now renounced this claim. Yet rows about the fascist era keep breaking out in Italy. The latest was provoked this month during a football match in Rome. After scoring a spectacular goal, Paolo Di Canio of Lazio ran over to his team's notoriously right-wing supporters and gave them a fascist salute. In theory, this is illegal in Italy. But a degree of confusion is understandable. Just outside the Olympic stadium in which the game was being played stands a large obelisk that is emblazoned with the words ""Mussolini, Duce"".
Similar controversies rage elsewhere in western Europe. In Spain, the Valley of the Fallen, a fascist mausoleum built by political prisoners, remains one of the country's biggest tourist attractions. Franco loyalists still rally there on the anniversary of the caudillo's death. The Socialist government of Jose Luis Rodrguez Zapatero (whose grandfather was killed by fascists) says that it wants to cleanse public buildings of Francoist symbols. A campaign is under way to build a memorial to the victims of fascism at the Valley of the Fallen, or a museum modelled on those at Nazi concentration camps. But the government will move cautiously. The wounds of Spain's past are still sore.
The question of free speech and the past is also a live one in France. This month, Jean-Marie Le Pen, leader of the far-right National Front and one of the two run-off candidates for the French presidency in 2002, caused outrage when he suggested that the Nazi occupation of France had ""not been particularly inhumane"". Mr Le Pen's critics rushed to remind him of the deportation and murder of the French Jews, and talked of such massacres as that at Oradour-sur-Glane. French prosecutors are looking into whether Mr Le Pen might be tried for the crime (in French law) of ""denial of crimes against humanity"".
Back in Blighty
Now even Britain, which had long thought of itself as happily immune to such controversies, has been dragged into the debate by Prince Harry. German members of the European Parliament have led calls for the EU to adopt a law similar to Germany's own statute banning Nazi symbols. Some Germans seem to relish the unusual opportunity to take the moral high ground over Nazism. Matthias Matussek, the London correspondent for Der Spiegel (and brother of Germany's ambassador to Britain), informed his readers that, while the British were still unhealthily obsessed by the war, they had been ""focusing too much on their own triumph and too little on the history of the victims. It now appears that the British have a greater problem with the past than the Germans."" You can almost taste the wishful thinking.
The argument of those Germans who want an EU-wide ban on Nazi symbols is, as Silvana Koch-Merin, a vice-president of the Liberal Group in the European Parliament, expresses it, that ""all of Europe suffered because of the crimes of the Nazis, therefore it would be logical for Nazi symbols to be banned all over Europe."" But such ""logic"" risks redefining Nazism as a European tragedy, rather than a tragedy visited on Europe by Germans. Even today, that does not quite ring true. While it was grossly insensitive for Prince Harry to wear a Nazi uniform, a similar action by a prominent young German would have been a lot more sinister and disturbing.
That is why a ban on Nazi insignia may make sense in Germany, but be an excessive restriction on free speech in Britain and most other countries. Even in the ""united Europe"" of today, Nazi symbols and the memories of fascism and communism resonate differently in different countries. Each country deals with them as it sees fit, which is as it should be.",230,Spain,"Why banning Nazi symbols across Europe would be a bad idea

SPAIN'S defence minister, Jose Bono, likes to wrap himself in the national flag.

But the protesters' bigger target was the Basque terrorist group, ETA. And the attack on Mr Bono was the work of right-wing thugs.
What Mr Bono, a devout Catholic and patriot who prides himself on being a macho iberico, received seems to have been a ""gay-bashing"", provoked by the government's promotion of gay rights.

He and another Socialist politician fled, after a man wielding an iron bar joined the attack.

Another target of verbal abuse was Gregorio Peces-Barba, a Socialist recently appointed as ombudsman of all victims' groups. He called on both main parties to stop making political capital out of victims. 
Neo-fascist skinheads were notably absent from the rally. A PP spokesman roundly condemned the attacks, which were started by middle-aged right-wingers. The old nationalist chant, ""United, Spain will not be defeated"", was directed at the Socialist government, whose opposition to the Basques' plan for a referendum on becoming a free state is deemed too soft. Fears are also stirring on the right since the government said it might talk to ETA if it laid down its weapons for good.

ANOTHER week, another ETA outrage. On February 9th the Basque terrorists exploded a car bomb in Madrid, injuring over 40 people outside a convention centre about to be visited by the king and the Mexican president. This is the latest in a string of car bombings, though nobody has been killed by ETA for over a year.
The bombs come at a sensitive point in Madrid's relations with the Basques. Mariano Rajoy, leader of the opposition People's Party (PP), has accused the Basques of making a ""thinly veiled declaration of independence"". He is referring to the plan of the Basque premier, Juan Jose Ibarretxe, to hold a referendum on the region's right to self-determination and to form a ""free state associated with Spain"". The Socialist government of Jose Luis Rodrguez Zapatero is also under pressure from Catalans who want far more autonomy, especially Josep Llus Carod-Rovira, leader of the Catalan Nationalist Left that shares power with the Socialists in Catalonia. 
Mr Zapatero is accused by critics both of being soft on terrorism and of presiding over the disintegration of Spain. His PP predecessor, Jose Mara Aznar, refused to speak to Mr Ibarretxe. Mr Zapatero's conciliatory tone has been seen as weakness. Some claim that regional ambitions pose the greatest threat to Spanish unity since the civil war. Will there soon be an independent Basque state? If Catalonia takes the same path, is this the end of Spain? 
The short answer to both questions is no. But there are bumpy months ahead for Mr Zapatero, as Spain's two most fractious regions engage in rough horse-trading over their future relationship with Madrid. 
The Spanish government insists the Ibarretxe referendum will not be allowed. ""It is simply not going to happen. All the exits are locked,"" the justice minister, Juan Fernando Lpez Aguilar, told The Economist this week. Why not? ""It is unconstitutional. It is a matter of principle,"" he replied. One poll suggests that over 60% of Spaniards want the government to take legal action against the Basque government if it tries to hold the referendum and--incredibly--over half think the armed forces should be wheeled in to stop it. 
Mr Zapatero's troubles began in late December when the Basque assembly voted for the Ibarretxe plan, which seeks to introduce Basque citizenship, an independent judiciary, a penal system, devolved responsibility for social security and the power to sign international treaties. It also stakes claims to Navarre and the French Basque region.
In mid-January Batasuna, ETA's banned political wing, said it was prepared to work for ""an agreement between nationalists and non-nationalists"". The party leader, Arnaldo Otegi, drew a parallel with Northern Ireland, and called on Mr Zapatero to ""go down in history as the Spanish Tony Blair"" by negotiating a peace deal. Two days later ETA, which despite its bombings has been weakened by recent arrests, announced its support for Batasuna's overtures. But Mr Zapatero has said that he will talk to ETA only once it lays down its arms indefinitely. 
Earlier this month Mr Zapatero allowed the Ibarretxe plan to be debated in the Spanish parliament, the Cortes. ""I have come to this parliament to defend the right of the Basque people to decide their own future,"" said Mr Ibarretxe. After eight hours of debate, the plan was overwhelmingly rejected, by 313 votes to 29. Mr Ibarretxe responded by vowing to call his referendum anyway and moving regional elections forward to April 17th. ""The moment has come for Basque society to speak out,"" he said. ""No one who calls himself a democrat can deny our right to decide for ourselves. We can only co-exist with Spain by our own free will."" 
The polls suggest that Mr Ibarretxe's Basque Nationalist Party (PNV) and its allies will win 42% of the vote, falling three seats short of an absolute majority. The PNV has asked Mr Zapatero to allow Batasuna to run in the elections, but refused to delay to give it time to declare the necessary ceasefire. At the May 2001 election seven Batasuna politicians won seats that they kept even after the party was later banned. Theoretically the party will now disappear from any official position. 
Mr Zapatero did, however, tell the Cortes that its debate had opened the way for negotiations to take place ""for a new project for Euskadi [the Spanish Basque region] and Spain"". He added that ""the highest degree of self-government is possible, but we will decide together. All the Basques will decide--and all Spaniards."" Previously he had ruled out a parliamentary commission to renegotiate the Basques' status. Now it is a possibility.
Hours before the debate the Basque Socialist leader, Patxi Lpez, proposed a diluted form of the Ibarretxe plan that skated around sovereignty. News also emerged of a secret meeting between Mr Zapatero and the PNV president, Josu Jon Imaz. PP tongues have been wagging about a possible deal: Madrid might, for instance, accept more devolved tax-raising powers and a fully autonomous education system.
For all the PP's carping, Mr Zapatero could yet emerge as the architect of a ""new Spain"". The constitution has served 27 years; Catalan nationalists are drawing up a new one which, despite Mr Carod-Rovira's populist harangues, will, according to Catalonia's Socialist premier, Pasqual Maragall, remain within the bounds set by the 1978 text. The Basques may yet be persuaded to stay within those bounds too.",230,Spain,"The Spanish government faces a delicate negotiation if it is to forestall Basque demands for some form of independence
ANOTHER week, another ETA outrage. On February 9th the Basque terrorists exploded a car bomb in Madrid, injuring over 40 people outside a convention centre about to be visited by the king and the Mexican president. This is the latest in a string of car bombings, though nobody has been killed by ETA for over a year.
The bombs come at a sensitive point in Madrid's relations with the Basques. Mariano Rajoy, leader of the opposition People's Party (PP), has accused the Basques of making a ""thinly veiled declaration of independence"". He is referring to the plan of the Basque premier, Juan Jose Ibarretxe, to hold a referendum on the region's right to self-determination and to form a ""free state associated with Spain"". The Socialist government of Jose Luis Rodrguez Zapatero is also under pressure from Catalans who want far more autonomy, especially Josep Llus Carod-Rovira, leader of the Catalan Nationalist Left that shares power with the Socialists in Catalonia. 
Mr Zapatero is accused by critics both of being soft on terrorism and of presiding over the disintegration of Spain. His PP predecessor, Jose Mara Aznar, refused to speak to Mr Ibarretxe. Mr Zapatero's conciliatory tone has been seen as weakness. Some claim that regional ambitions pose the greatest threat to Spanish unity since the civil war. Will there soon be an independent Basque state? If Catalonia takes the same path, is this the end of Spain? 
The short answer to both questions is no. But there are bumpy months ahead for Mr Zapatero, as Spain's two most fractious regions engage in rough horse-trading over their future relationship with Madrid. 
The Spanish government insists the Ibarretxe referendum will not be allowed. ""It is simply not going to happen. All the exits are locked,"" the justice minister, Juan Fernando Lpez Aguilar, told The Economist this week. Why not? ""It is unconstitutional. It is a matter of principle,"" he replied. One poll suggests that over 60% of Spaniards want the government to take legal action against the Basque government if it tries to hold the referendum and--incredibly--over half think the armed forces should be wheeled in to stop it. 
Mr Zapatero's troubles began in late December when the Basque assembly voted for the Ibarretxe plan, which seeks to introduce Basque citizenship, an independent judiciary, a penal system, devolved responsibility for social security and the power to sign international treaties. It also stakes claims to Navarre and the French Basque region.
In mid-January Batasuna, ETA's banned political wing, said it was prepared to work for ""an agreement between nationalists and non-nationalists"". The party leader, Arnaldo Otegi, drew a parallel with Northern Ireland, and called on Mr Zapatero to ""go down in history as the Spanish Tony Blair"" by negotiating a peace deal. Two days later ETA, which despite its bombings has been weakened by recent arrests, announced its support for Batasuna's overtures. But Mr Zapatero has said that he will talk to ETA only once it lays down its arms indefinitely. 
Earlier this month Mr Zapatero allowed the Ibarretxe plan to be debated in the Spanish parliament, the Cortes. ""I have come to this parliament to defend the right of the Basque people to decide their own future,"" said Mr Ibarretxe. After eight hours of debate, the plan was overwhelmingly rejected, by 313 votes to 29. Mr Ibarretxe responded by vowing to call his referendum anyway and moving regional elections forward to April 17th. ""The moment has come for Basque society to speak out,"" he said. ""No one who calls himself a democrat can deny our right to decide for ourselves. We can only co-exist with Spain by our own free will."" 
The polls suggest that Mr Ibarretxe's Basque Nationalist Party (PNV) and its allies will win 42% of the vote, falling three seats short of an absolute majority. The PNV has asked Mr Zapatero to allow Batasuna to run in the elections, but refused to delay to give it time to declare the necessary ceasefire. At the May 2001 election seven Batasuna politicians won seats that they kept even after the party was later banned. Theoretically the party will now disappear from any official position. 
Mr Zapatero did, however, tell the Cortes that its debate had opened the way for negotiations to take place ""for a new project for Euskadi [the Spanish Basque region] and Spain"". He added that ""the highest degree of self-government is possible, but we will decide together. All the Basques will decide--and all Spaniards."" Previously he had ruled out a parliamentary commission to renegotiate the Basques' status. Now it is a possibility.
Hours before the debate the Basque Socialist leader, Patxi Lpez, proposed a diluted form of the Ibarretxe plan that skated around sovereignty. News also emerged of a secret meeting between Mr Zapatero and the PNV president, Josu Jon Imaz. PP tongues have been wagging about a possible deal: Madrid might, for instance, accept more devolved tax-raising powers and a fully autonomous education system.
For all the PP's carping, Mr Zapatero could yet emerge as the architect of a ""new Spain"".

""THE government wants to honour all the victims of terrorism with sobriety and simplicity, especially all those people who lost their lives or were injured a year ago in an attack that deeply shocked Spaniards, filling our hearts with pain and fright."" So declared Spain's deputy prime minister, Mara Teresa Fernndez de la Vega, last week. This week, the flags flew at half-mast and bells chimed to mark the first anniversary of the day when Islamist terrorists exploded ten bombs on commuter trains in Madrid, killing 191 and injuring 1,500. In fact the aftermath of the bombings has been marred by political squabbling and rancour.
That is mainly because, three days after the attacks, Spanish voters threw out the centre-right government of Jose Mara Aznar, amid accusations that his Popular Party had tried to manipulate public opinion by pinning the blame for the attacks on the Basque terrorist group, ETA. The true attackers actually talked of revenge for the loss of the Moorish kingdom of al-Andalus and of punishing Mr Aznar's government for backing America's war in Iraq. Ever since, Spanish politics has been stuck with two crude positions adopted by the main parties: the PP believes that Osama bin Laden won the election, while the Socialist government of Jose Luis Rodrguez Zapatero insists that the timing of the attacks was entirely coincidental.
Mr Zapatero's first move as prime minister was to withdraw Spain's troops from Iraq, thereby incurring the wrath of President George Bush. Despite making frantic efforts to mend fences, Mr Zapatero is still waiting for Mr Bush to return his calls. The government reoriented its European Union policy to Spain's traditional support for France and Germany; it has just won the first referendum on the EU constitution, albeit on a turnout of only 42%. And it launched a host of social reforms that have angered the Catholic Church, while delighting most Spaniards. But Mr Zapatero, who has still to live down his nickname ""Bambi"", is often seen as a lightweight. Many fear, in particular, that he is not tough enough to cope with regional nationalist demands for more autonomy.
In terms of security, laws in place since 2003 to deal with ETA allow the state to imprison terrorist suspects for up to four years without trial. The interior ministry has also created a joint command to co-ordinate the two main national police forces; recruited more anti-terrorist officers and Arabic experts; and isolated radical Islamist prisoners after newspaper reports claimed that they were running some prison wings. During this anniversary week, politicians, security experts and academics from around the world gathered in Madrid for a three-day meeting to discuss broader plans to fight terrorism.
As for the perpetrators, soon after the attacks seven suspects, mainly Moroccans, blew themselves up, killing a police officer, whose grave was later defiled. This week the police announced the arrest of yet another Moroccan youth suspected of involvement in the bombings, bringing to 75 the number arrested (33 of these have been released). Between six and eight suspects are still thought to be at large.
If March 11th has bequeathed Spaniards anything other than grief, it is a parliamentary commission of which they can feel genuinely ashamed. The commission has been characterised by back-biting and point-scoring, and has achieved nothing. Victims' groups refused to join the anniversary ceremonies. Many accuse the politicians of exploiting the atrocity for political gain. As Pilar Manjn, head of one left-dominated victims' group, said, ""what we want is to know the truth...and the people's representatives haven't managed to tell us a year later what brought us to this situation."" Attempts to unite her group with more right-leaning groups representing victims of ETA terrorism ended in bickering and failure.
After eight months of deliberation, the parliamentary commission has come up with trivial recommendations: more police at embassies in Arab and Islamic countries, updating security arrangements in north Africa and elsewhere, hiring more investigators, interpreters and translators. Mariano Rajoy, the PP leader, damned the recommendations as fraudulent, adding that his party just wanted to know the truth.

WHEN France's president, Jacques Chirac, dropped in recently on Jose Luis Rodrguez Zapatero, Spain's Socialist prime minister, his host paid him a rather unusual compliment. ""Some people may well wonder,"" said Mr Zapatero, ""whether Jacques Chirac really is a leader of the centre-right, compared with others that we know."" In recent months, the pair seem to have become inseparable, meeting for summits and congratulating each other on their shared vision. To many outside France, it might seem odd that Europe's longest-serving conservative leader is so keen to identify closely with a Spanish Socialist. Yet Mr Chirac's fondness for his new Spanish friend should perhaps not be that much of a surprise. For Mr Chirac himself is these days one of the most left-wing of Europe's leaders.
Consider Mr Chirac's credentials as a champion of the left. His recent proposal to create an ""international solidarity levy"" on international financial transactions or airline-ticket sales, so as to finance African development and the fight against AIDS, won him the acclaim of the third-world lobby. ""Development is both the greatest challenge and the greatest urgency of our time,"" he declared in a speech broadcast at the World Economic Forum in Davos in January, calling Africa's poverty ""morally unacceptable"". Mr Chirac is also a certified ecolo (green), having got his cherished environmental charter enshrined in France's constitution last month. This puts the right to live in a healthy environment on the same legal footing in France as human rights, setting the country up as a pioneer in environmental protection--and Mr Chirac as potential saviour of the planet. 
The French president has no rivals as global spokesman on anti-Americanism, a doctrine that usually belongs to the left in Europe but in France has a long history on the Gaullist right as well. To this, he has added his own blend of anti-globalisation, globe-trotting with the likes of Brazil's President Luiz Incio Lula da Silva, a former trade-union leader, and dispatching representatives to the World Social Forum. Moreover, with his Arabist foreign policy in the Middle East, and his defiant hostility to the war in Iraq, he seems to have a soft-left world outlook that would fit well on any university campus. 
On economic matters, this is certainly no market-liberalising, right-wing government. In May, Mr Chirac will celebrate ten years in office. It is hard to detect what mark his decade has left. Admittedly, he shared five years (1997-2002) with a Socialist government, which introduced such policies as the 35-hour week. But even this is not something that Mr Chirac's present centre-right government, under Jean-Pierre Raffarin, has been in any rush to dismantle: its reforms have loosened the rules, not overturned them. 
Mr Chirac has contined to resist EU efforts to liberalise the energy market. He is now blocking the services directive, which he said this week was ""unacceptable"" and should be ""picked apart"". He has even reactivated an interventionist industrial policy. And he has a high spender's tendency to throw money at political problems, especially ones that spill out on to the street--one reason why France's budget deficit has widened sharply.
Only this week, Mr Chirac's government was busy yet again caving in to demands for public-sector pay rises after 600,000-1m protesters took to the streets. Having stood firm for a full three days, it promised to reopen wage talks, and did not rule out another increase in the minimum wage, after a rise of 5.8% last year. Even the left-leaning Liberation could scarcely believe it: ""The volte-face of the government, which is today proposing to open the coffers which it swore yesterday were empty, will prove right all the numerous unionists who believe that there is no point in discussing coolly and that social dialogue is a sham unless they turn up at the negotiating table with a loaded gun.""
Mr Chirac has not strayed entirely from centre-right territory. He campaigned for election in 2002 with a promise to cut income tax by a third, and this is still official policy. Yet the combined efforts of four successive finance ministers have secured only a modest 10% reduction. He is pressing ahead with privatisation too: his latest finance minister, Thierry Breton, has confirmed that Electricite de France and Gaz de France are being prepared for sale. But the right hardly has a monopoly on privatisation, a policy embraced in some ways just as fervently by the former Socialist government.
What does all this add up to? ""Compared with the rest of the European right--Berlusconi, Merkel, Aznar--he is certainly different,"" comments a leading French Socialist. ""They are all both more liberal and more Atlanticist."" Mr Chirac's economic policy certainly puts him to the left of Britain's Tony Blair. Even Germany's Gerhard Schroder has done more to deregulate the labour market and reform welfare than Mr Chirac. His new chum, Mr Zapatero, is arguably his closest ideological ally now. 
One explanation for Mr Chirac's embrace of a soft-left, statist, instinctively anti-capitalist creed could be that he is playing Mr Blair's post-ideological game of stealing the opposition's clothes ahead of the 2007 presidential election. A French presidential candidate needs broad electoral appeal in the run-off, and the country's political centre of gravity lies well to the left of Britain's, say. 
Another explanation is that his variety of continental conservatism belongs to a social Gaullist tradition, which--like Christian Democracy--often defines itself precisely against liberalism. Under this doctrine, the language of ""social cohesion"" and ""solidarity"" belongs to the right as much as to the left. In other words, Mr Chirac has not been liberalising simply because, as one adviser says, ""he does not believe in untempered liberalism"". 
Yet this may be to lend more coherence to Mr Chirac's policies than they deserve. More plausibly, exactly 40 years since he was first elected to public office, he is guided less by conviction than by a desire to keep the social peace and avoid confrontation. As prime minister in the late-1980s, Mr Chirac was seen as an energetic reformer. Age and power have tempered such zeal; consensus now matters more than change. At the EU summit next week to consider economic reforms, France will again be in the rearguard, not the vanguard.

IT HAS become a familiar routine. There is a European Union summit; a row breaks out between Jacques Chirac and Tony Blair; a little later, the two men patch things up. But with Jacques and Tony--as with Punch and Judy--any truce is strictly temporary. It is never all that long before they are back hitting each other over the head with rolling-pins.
So it was last week, at the latest EU get-together in Brussels. Mr Blair went into the summit determined to be nice to Mr Chirac. The French president is facing big trouble at home, where the opinion polls increasingly suggest that the French may vote down the new EU constitution in a referendum on May 29th. Much of the French opposition has focused on the so-called ""Bolkestein directive""--a plan to liberalise trade in services. Mr Chirac needed his colleagues to promise to rewrite the directive; Mr Blair and his fellow leaders duly obliged. The British prime minister was thus distinctly unamused when Mr Chirac used his closing press conference to question ""the British cheque"", the much-cherished rebate that Britain gets on its contributions to the EU budget. By the time he had got back to London, Mr Blair's irritation was plain. Speaking to the House of Commons, he painted the French in general as reactionaries clinging to a failing economic model. 
The two leaders still claim (a trifle implausibly) to get on well personally. Mr Chirac has taken an avuncular interest in Leo, Mr Blair's youngest son, and has even been given a photograph of the infant. But, however warm may be their personal feelings, it has become clear that there is a structural conflict built into the Chirac-Blair relationship. They have diametrically opposed visions of how the EU should evolve, and they are engaged in a struggle over which should prevail.
The Blairite vision is Atlanticist, economically liberal, suspicious of deeper political integration and strongly in favour of further enlargement of the EU to include Turkey and others. Mr Chirac, by contrast, wants to build up the EU as a counterweight to America and has become deeply suspicious of Brussels's liberalising tendencies. Unlike most of his compatriots, however, Mr Chirac has steadfastly supported Turkey's bid for EU membership--perhaps realising that his aim to turn the EU into a world power can work only if it grows in size.
In other respects, though, there is little doubt that EU enlargement has greatly weakened Mr Chirac's entire European strategy, while providing a boost to Mr Blair. In the EU of 15 that existed until 2004, it was still possible for the Franco-German duo to dominate. With the addition of ten more countries, most of them inclined to share Mr Blair's pro-American, economically liberal views, the power balance has shifted markedly. Mr Chirac's frustration with this new situation became evident in the run-up to the Iraq war, when his claim to speak for Europe in his opposition to the war was undermined by the sight of almost all the countries from the ""new Europe"" lining up on the Anglo-American side. At the time it was reckoned that 16 EU countries were backing Mr Blair and only nine were with Mr Chirac.
The Iraq war may have offered the most graphic illustration of the shift in power within the enlarged EU, but there have been others. In December 2001, when EU leaders were choosing a president for their constitutional convention, Mr Chirac was still able to force through his candidate: Valery Giscard d'Estaing, a previous French president. In mid-2004, however, the Franco-German pair were no longer able to impose on an EU of 25 their preferred candidate, Belgium's Guy Verhofstadt, as president of the European Commission. Instead, Jose Manuel Barroso, a former Portuguese prime minister who is both an economic liberal and was a supporter of the Iraq war, got the job. Mr Barroso is now being demonised in France in much the same way as Jacques Delors, a French predecessor, was once demonised in Britain--as a Brussels bureaucrat who is seeking to impose alien and dangerous ideas. 
The change of atmosphere within the commission illustrates the shift in the EU balance of power away from Mr Chirac and towards Mr Blair. But the game is far from over. His travails over Iraq have tarnished Mr Blair's image in Europe. Last year's change of government in Spain gave Mr Chirac an important new ally in the shape of Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero, a Spanish socialist who really is socialist. If Silvio Berlusconi were replaced by Romano Prodi in Italy next year, the Chirac wing would gain another ally--although if Angela Merkel also defeats Gerhard Schroder in Germany, she might tack towards the Blair camp.
The new members of the EU in central Europe are not necessarily permanent adherents of the Blair side, either. Several have had second thoughts about Iraq. And they all want to join the European single currency, from which Britain has stood aside. But if Blairite prestige suffered because of Iraq, high unemployment in France has damaged Mr Chirac, whereas the relative economic dynamism of Britain has strengthened Mr Blair.
Constitutional concerns
In their continuing struggle for leadership and influence within the European Union, both the British and French leaders now face identical challenges: the need to win a domestic referendum on the EU constitution. Until a few weeks ago, it looked as if Mr Blair would come off worst. Britain is not due to vote until the first half of next year, and British officials had been bracing themselves for the nightmare in which the 24 other EU countries ratify the constitution and only Britain says no. But the shift in the polls in France has now put the pressure back on Mr Chirac. He himself has argued that a French rejection of the constitution would be a grave blow to his country's prestige and influence within the EU. It might also allow Mr Blair to cancel his own, even trickier referendum in Britain: ""a two for one deal"", as one beaming British official puts it.",230,Spain,"The usual Jacques 'n' Tony punch-up in Brussels

The British prime minister was thus distinctly unamused when Mr Chirac used his closing press conference to question ""the British cheque"", the much-cherished rebate that Britain gets on its contributions to the EU budget. By the time he had got back to London, Mr Blair's irritation was plain. Speaking to the House of Commons, he painted the French in general as reactionaries clinging to a failing economic model. 
The two leaders still claim (a trifle implausibly) to get on well personally. Mr Chirac has taken an avuncular interest in Leo, Mr Blair's youngest son, and has even been given a photograph of the infant. But, however warm may be their personal feelings, it has become clear that there is a structural conflict built into the Chirac-Blair relationship. They have diametrically opposed visions of how the EU should evolve, and they are engaged in a struggle over which should prevail.
The Blairite vision is Atlanticist, economically liberal, suspicious of deeper political integration and strongly in favour of further enlargement of the EU to include Turkey and others. Mr Chirac, by contrast, wants to build up the EU as a counterweight to America and has become deeply suspicious of Brussels's liberalising tendencies. Unlike most of his compatriots, however, Mr Chirac has steadfastly supported Turkey's bid for EU membership--perhaps realising that his aim to turn the EU into a world power can work only if it grows in size.
In other respects, though, there is little doubt that EU enlargement has greatly weakened Mr Chirac's entire European strategy, while providing a boost to Mr Blair. In the EU of 15 that existed until 2004, it was still possible for the Franco-German duo to dominate. With the addition of ten more countries, most of them inclined to share Mr Blair's pro-American, economically liberal views, the power balance has shifted markedly. Mr Chirac's frustration with this new situation became evident in the run-up to the Iraq war, when his claim to speak for Europe in his opposition to the war was undermined by the sight of almost all the countries from the ""new Europe"" lining up on the Anglo-American side. At the time it was reckoned that 16 EU countries were backing Mr Blair and only nine were with Mr Chirac.
The Iraq war may have offered the most graphic illustration of the shift in power within the enlarged EU, but there have been others. In December 2001, when EU leaders were choosing a president for their constitutional convention, Mr Chirac was still able to force through his candidate: Valery Giscard d'Estaing, a previous French president. In mid-2004, however, the Franco-German pair were no longer able to impose on an EU of 25 their preferred candidate, Belgium's Guy Verhofstadt, as president of the European Commission. Instead, Jose Manuel Barroso, a former Portuguese prime minister who is both an economic liberal and was a supporter of the Iraq war, got the job. Mr Barroso is now being demonised in France in much the same way as Jacques Delors, a French predecessor, was once demonised in Britain--as a Brussels bureaucrat who is seeking to impose alien and dangerous ideas. 
The change of atmosphere within the commission illustrates the shift in the EU balance of power away from Mr Chirac and towards Mr Blair. But the game is far from over. His travails over Iraq have tarnished Mr Blair's image in Europe. Last year's change of government in Spain gave Mr Chirac an important new ally in the shape of Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero, a Spanish socialist who really is socialist. If Silvio Berlusconi were replaced by Romano Prodi in Italy next year, the Chirac wing would gain another ally--although if Angela Merkel also defeats Gerhard Schroder in Germany, she might tack towards the Blair camp.
The new members of the EU in central Europe are not necessarily permanent adherents of the Blair side, either. Several have had second thoughts about Iraq. And they all want to join the European single currency, from which Britain has stood aside. But if Blairite prestige suffered because of Iraq, high unemployment in France has damaged Mr Chirac, whereas the relative economic dynamism of Britain has strengthened Mr Blair.
Constitutional concerns
In their continuing struggle for leadership and influence within the European Union, both the British and French leaders now face identical challenges: the need to win a domestic referendum on the EU constitution. Until a few weeks ago, it looked as if Mr Blair would come off worst. Britain is not due to vote until the first half of next year, and British officials had been bracing themselves for the nightmare in which the 24 other EU countries ratify the constitution and only Britain says no. But the shift in the polls in France has now put the pressure back on Mr Chirac. He himself has argued that a French rejection of the constitution would be a grave blow to his country's prestige and influence within the EU. It might also allow Mr Blair to cancel his own, even trickier referendum in Britain: ""a two for one deal"", as one beaming British official puts it.",True

IT IS the problem that won't go away. Ever since Spain adopted its present constitution in 1978, its restive regions, especially the Basque country and Catalonia, have agitated for more autonomy from Madrid. As it happens, voters in last weekend's Basque elections gave a rebuff to their nationalist premier, Juan Jose Ibarretxe, who had hoped for stronger support so that he could hold a referendum on the right to form a ""free state associated with Spain"". But even if the Ibarretxe plan is dead in its present form, demands for more autonomy and even, one day, for independence seem sure to persist.
It thus behoves the government in Madrid to work out carefully how to respond. Successive Spanish governments have been willing to concede plenty of autonomy. But they have rigidly refused to contemplate any possibility of secession. The tone was set by the previous People's Party government under Jose Maria Aznar, who refused even to meet Mr Ibarretxe, arguing that any negotiation, even with moderate Basque nationalists, would not only threaten the territorial integrity of Spain but also represent a concession to the Basque terrorists, ETA, whose political wing was banned.
Mr Aznar's Socialist successor, Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero, has been more flexible. There are encouraging hints, after the Basque election, that he may now negotiate a deal with Mr Ibarretxe that could lead to a revised plan, including extra autonomy but stopping short of full independence, being put to the vote ()see page 45. A ceasefire by ETA, now bizarrely represented in the Basque parliament by the local Communists, would have to be part of the deal. Yet the formal position in Madrid remains that any vote on independence, by any region, is unconstitutional and cannot be allowed.
Nobody should advocate concessions to men of violence. Yet a refusal to listen to peaceful demands for independence is short-sighted. Worse, it is likely to be counter-productive. Mr Aznar's intransigence seems to have served largely to bolster the nationalist vote in the Basque country. The latest election suggests that Mr Zapatero's flexibility may instead be weakening it. The best policy now would be for Mr Zapatero to go a stage further, by accepting that, if a majority of any region's people ever peacefully decides that they want independence, the government in Madrid should be ready to negotiate.
Such a course has been followed successfully in Canada over Quebec. Rather than asserting that any demand for independence by Quebec was illegal, the federal government decided, following a Supreme Court ruling, to pass the so-called Clarity Act in 2000. This act sets out the conditions which Quebec (or any other province) would have to fulfil if it wished to secede: it would have to hold a referendum on a simple and clear question; it would have to secure a clear majority in favour; and it would then have to negotiate the terms of its departure with the government in Ottawa.
The benefit of the Clarity Act is not just that it sets out a procedure for peaceful secession, if a majority of a region wants it. It is that it seems, at least for now, to have defused the demand for secession itself. Countries will not always hold together, especially when there have been wars: in the next few years both Kosovo and Montenegro are likely to break free of Serbia, for example. But experience has often shown that, when the notion of secession is stamped on, pressure for it only rises--whereas, if secession is clearly permitted, many would-be secessionists cease to press so hard for it.",230,Spain,"How to respond to perennial demands from separatists in Spain

THE Basque premier, Juan Jose Ibarretxe, had hoped that the regional election on April 17th would give him a new mandate for his plan to move closer to independence. Instead, his Basque Nationalist Party (PNV) lost four seats, leaving it well short of a majority. Spain's Socialist government in Madrid, heartened by a gain of five seats for the local Socialist party, making it the second-biggest in the region, declared that Mr Ibarretxe had failed in his aim. In a low turnout, the PNV, which has been in power for 25 years, lost 140,000 votes from its 2001 tally. 
""The Ibarretxe plan has been defeated democratically...[it] is now part of the past,"" announced Jose Blanco, a leading local Socialist. The plan was narrowly approved by the Basque parliament in December, but rejected by the Cortes in Madrid in February. Mr Ibarretxe promptly called elections a month early, hoping the masses would rally to the cause. The questions now are: why did his plan not prosper, and is it really dead?
Few voters understood the Ibarretxe plan. Some PNV members said it was too ambitious; others that it did not go far enough. But another reason for the PNV's performance was that it failed to win voters away from Batasuna, the banned political wing of the ETA terrorists. Arnaldo Otegi, Batasuna's leader, seems to have pulled off a master-stroke. After the courts stopped a surrogate party from standing as a Batasuna front, Mr Otegi told supporters to vote for the (almost unknown) local Communist Party. Despite the Communists' close ties to Batasuna, the courts could find no reason to ban them; they won over 12% of the vote and nine seats, two more than the (pre-ban) Batasuna in 2001. The opposition People's Party (PP) criticised the prime minister, Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero, for letting ETA survive politically. ""ETA is going to shape political life and that is very discouraging,"" said Maria San Gil, the PP's local boss.
There will now be months of horse-trading, as the PNV looks for a workable coalition. Mr Ibarretxe may form a minority government in alliance with his current partner, the United Left, plus Aralar, a Batasuna splinter that advocates Basque independence but rejects ETA's terrorism. But that would still give him only 33 seats in the 75-seat assembly, the same as the Socialists and PP combined. Or Mr Ibarretxe could link with the Communists, which would give him a majority but make it harder to negotiate with Madrid.
A more intriguing possibility is an informal pact with the Socialists. During the campaign Mr Zapatero said that he was prepared to negotiate a new constitutional deal acceptable to a broad majority of Basques, and would put it to a referendum if it won two-thirds backing in the Basque parliament. In this way the Ibarretxe plan could survive in mutated form, perhaps shorn of some demands for national recognition and autonomy. Indeed, many local commentators sense a new optimism.
The sources of this optimism are the ""Zapatero effect"", the prime minister's almost tiresome willingness to negotiate, plus the fact that Batasuna and ETA have a new desire for peace. ETA has not killed for two years. For the first time in decades the elections were free from violence. Mr Zapatero repeated this week that it was time for solutions. Mr Otegi talks of a deal short of breaking away from Spain that involves ""the recognition of the Basque nation and our right to self-determination"".

ON THE evidence of history, the Catholic authorities of Spain do not deal gently with those who dissent from religious orthodoxy. Small wonder, perhaps, that this ancient bastion of Catholicism should be the scene of the first big bust-up between the church and a European state under the new papacy of Benedict XVI, who has pledged to reaffirm the continent's Christian heritage.
Emboldened by the enthronement of a leader after his own, conservative heart, the head of the Vatican's Council on the Family--who happens to be a Spanish-speaker, Cardinal Alfonso Lopez Trujillo of Colombia--has reacted furiously to a new piece of Spanish legislation, allowing homosexuals to marry and to adopt children. Calling the law ""iniquitous"", the cardinal had urged municipal bureaucrats to refuse to officiate at gay wedding ceremonies, even if it means losing their jobs.
So not for the first time, a Catholic prelate from a Latin country is weighing in against a socialist government, over a sensitive moral issue, and giving heart to the conservative opposition. So far, so very familiar, you may say. But things are more complex than they look.
For one thing, there are some supporters of the People's Party, the centre-right opposition, whose anti-gay zeal is an embarrassment to their fellows. Take Lluis Caldentey, the mayor of the Catalan town of Pontons: he was expelled from the PP after saying homosexuals were ""physically or psychologically handicapped"" and observing that he ""had never seen two male dogs trying to make love.""
Sensing there might be some political capital in denouncing his adversaries' homophobia, the socialist prime minister, Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero, has challenged Spain's conservatives to ""look into the eyes of homosexuals, and tell them they are second-class citizens."" 
Not everybody has responded to this tactic as the government hoped. While in most cases their language has been more cautious than Mr Caldentey's, dozens of right-wing mayors all over Spain have taken a similar stance, saying they will refuse to conduct ceremonies which offend their conscience--despite the government's insistence that when a law has been approved by parliament, state officials have no choice but to apply it. Nor, say the dissenters, are they prepared to take the easy way out and leave gay weddings to more liberal-minded colleagues.
""I intend not to exercise this authority [to marry gay couples] and not to delegate it to other municipal officials,"" insists Javier Leon de la Riva, the mayor of Valladolid. His counterpart in the town of Avila has praised him for his ""manly stance"".
Yet the leadership of the centre-right is uneasy about these implied threats to break the law. It insists, rather carefully, that all it opposes is the adoption of children by gay couples, and the use of the word matrimonio, a term which has clear religious overtones, to describe same-sex unions. What the PP is not questioning--says its leader, Mariano Rajoy--is the state's formal recognition of gay partnerships. He also insists that his supporters in local government must clench their teeth and obey the law--and has produced 16 PP mayors who say they are willing to do so. One PP politician in Valencia's regional assembly reacted to the law by announcing his own homosexuality. 
But even among the ruling socialists, there are some whose Catholic conscience has clearly been troubled by the new legislation. Dissent in the ranks of the government has surfaced in embarrassing ways. Jose Bono, the traditionally minded defence minister, is said to have applauded heartily after attending a dinner in Rome at which a conservative cardinal laid out his opposition to Spain's gay-marriage policy--while his colleague Juan Fernando Lopez Aguilar, the justice minister, sat nearby in stony silence. 
The socialist mayor of La Coruna, Francisco Vazquez, is another Catholic of the left: he has given warning that he will not support the bill in the Senate, where it may conceivably be defeated with the assistance of Basque and Catalan conservatives. The measure would then have to be resubmitted to the Cortes, or lower house--where the socialists have a majority, but would nonetheless face another round of bruising arguments. 
Shortly before his death, Pope John Paul II scolded Spain's socialists--who had moved to make divorce and abortion easier, and to permit stem-cell research--for pursuing a form of secularism that ""restricts religious freedom"". Mr Zapatero's relations with the new pope promise to be stormy too.

SPAIN'S Socialist prime minister, Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero, set off this week in search of the holy grail of Spanish politics: to negotiate the disbandment of the Basque terrorist group, ETA. And a risky adventure it could prove to be.
The government got the Cortes (parliament) in Madrid to pass a motion supporting ""dialogue between the competent authority within the state and whoever decides to give up violence."" The vote was 192-147, with the government winning backing from regional nationalists and other leftist parties. Only the opposition People's Party (PP) voted against, accusing Mr Zapatero of ""betraying the dead"" and ""surrendering parliament"". The PP's leader, Mariano Rajoy, asked Mr Zapatero to spell out the political price that would have to be paid for a deal with ETA.
The motion is explosive, as it runs against the hardline policy adopted by Mr Zapatero's PP predecessor, Jose Maria Aznar (though Mr Aznar earlier tried direct negotiations too). It has stirred up an emotive debate centred on victims of ETA terrorism, who plan to stage a protest in Madrid next month. ""To reach an agreement with ETA is to humiliate the living and the dead,"" said the head of the association representing the victims, Francisco Alcaraz. The future of the 2000 anti-terrorist pact, signed by both main political parties, which has contributed to ETA's present fragility, may now be in doubt. 
Although this is the first time a government has sought approval from the Cortes, previous governments have in fact talked to ETA. The Socialist government of Felipe Gonzalez did so in 1989, as did Mr Aznar in 1999, before ETA ended its 14-month ceasefire, causing him to round on all regional nationalists. Neither lot of talks ended the 30-year conflict that has killed more than 800 people. Almost two-thirds of Spaniards support the opening of talks between Madrid and ETA, if it renounces violence, says a poll by the Opina institute. Mr Zapatero argues that ETA has been weakened by numerous arrests and has not staged a fatal attack in two years, making this a good moment for a peace process.
Arnaldo Otegi, leader of ETA's banned political wing, Batasuna, has recently made vague overtures for peace. Most Basque political parties, still wrangling over forming a regional government after last month's elections, talk also of the existence of favourable conditions for peace. Mr Otegi has said that the Cortes's motion could lead to ""a Basque Stormont"" (after Ulster's parliament), but that Basques must decide their own future. Mr Zapatero has argued, unconvincingly, that there will be no political price to pay for talks. Officials insist that they have little to offer ETA beyond improving conditions for the several hundred prisoners from the group who are in Spanish and French jails.
A development that boded ill for Mr Zapatero's hopes was the explosion of four small bombs near Basque businesses last weekend. The bombs are thought to have followed non-payment of ETA's extortion money, known as revolutionary tax. Unusually, in a speech some hours later, Mr Zapatero failed to mention the bombings. Angel Acebes, a senior PP member, called the omission ""disgraceful"".
The newspaper El Pais called the talks proposal ""a high-risk political initiative"". Javier Pradera, a columnist, argued gloomily that ETA's ""opaque decision-making... and irrationality"" could mean that it tricks its interlocutors and plays for time. ""It would be improbable that an organisation like ETA would be ready to abandon violence without a political price,"" he wrote. Yet one top Socialist is confident. Referring to Northern Ireland, he says, ""Look at the Good Friday Agreement. It has been a long process. There was even Omagh [a lethal IRA bombing] to contend with.""",230,Spain,"The Spanish government is preparing to talk to the Basque terrorists

The Socialist government of Felipe Gonzalez did so in 1989, as did Mr Aznar in 1999, before ETA ended its 14-month ceasefire, causing him to round on all regional nationalists. Neither lot of talks ended the 30-year conflict that has killed more than 800 people. Almost two-thirds of Spaniards support the opening of talks between Madrid and ETA, if it renounces violence, says a poll by the Opina institute. Mr Zapatero argues that ETA has been weakened by numerous arrests and has not staged a fatal attack in two years, making this a good moment for a peace process.
Arnaldo Otegi, leader of ETA's banned political wing, Batasuna, has recently made vague overtures for peace. Most Basque political parties, still wrangling over forming a regional government after last month's elections, talk also of the existence of favourable conditions for peace. Mr Otegi has said that the Cortes's motion could lead to ""a Basque Stormont"" (after Ulster's parliament), but that Basques must decide their own future. Mr Zapatero has argued, unconvincingly, that there will be no political price to pay for talks. Officials insist that they have little to offer ETA beyond improving conditions for the several hundred prisoners from the group who are in Spanish and French jails.
A development that boded ill for Mr Zapatero's hopes was the explosion of four small bombs near Basque businesses last weekend. The bombs are thought to have followed non-payment of ETA's extortion money, known as revolutionary tax. Unusually, in a speech some hours later, Mr Zapatero failed to mention the bombings. Angel Acebes, a senior PP member, called the omission ""disgraceful"".
The newspaper El Pais called the talks proposal ""a high-risk political initiative"". Javier Pradera, a columnist, argued gloomily that ETA's ""opaque decision-making... and irrationality"" could mean that it tricks its interlocutors and plays for time. ""It would be improbable that an organisation like ETA would be ready to abandon violence without a political price,"" he wrote. Yet one top Socialist is confident. Referring to Northern Ireland, he says, ""Look at the Good Friday Agreement. It has been a long process. There was even Omagh [a lethal IRA bombing] to contend with.""",True

SPAIN'S richest region, Catalonia, is normally a sensible enough place. But its politicians may not be. On a recent trip to Israel, Josep Lluis Carod-Rovira, leader of the nationalist Catalan Republican Left (ERC), boycotted a wreath-laying at the tomb of Yitzhak Rabin because no Catalan flag was flying. He also called on Catalans not to back Madrid's bid for the 2012 Olympics, triggering a slump in sales of cava (Catalan sparkling wine) in the Spanish capital. Then there was the plea by Pasqual Maragall, Catalonia's Socialist premier (who is in coalition with Mr Carod-Rovira), for France to take Catalonia into the club for French-speaking countries. That riled Castilians--as did plans to ban bullfighting in Barcelona.
Underlying such friction is Catalonia's desire for a new constitutional statute giving it more autonomy. Spain's Socialist prime minister, Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero, has agreed to consider this, if only to respond to Catalonia's complaints about paying far more into the national kitty than it takes out. Mr Maragall also backs demands that Catalonia be recognised as ""a nation"". After all, Valencia, governed by the centre-right, has adopted a new constitutional statute referring to its region's ""historic nationality"". Yet the right frets that a weak Socialist-led government, dependent on regional nationalists, could endanger Spain's much-prized unity. 
Mr Zapatero is already under fire for offering to talk to the Basque terrorist group, ETA, if it renounces violence. Catalonia, with a population of almost 7m and one-fifth of Spain's GDP, matters more. The 1978 constitution gave it plenty of autonomy, and the offer of more has emboldened other regions. A survey by El Pais found that 11 of Spain's 17 regions want more autonomy. Even some Socialists are unhappy about this. The Socialist leader of Extremadura, Juan Carlos Rodriguez Ibarra, and the defence minister, Jose Bono, have both attacked Mr Maragall. Mr Ibarra took umbrage at Catalans' claims that they subsidised poorer regions, telling them to ""stick the cash where it fits"". The government promises not to give Catalonia a financial deal that is not available to, and backed by, other regions.
Mr Maragall dismisses talk of a crisis. He decries Spain's political culture, wedged between a centrist right and nationalists who cannot accept the pluralist reality of Spain. Will Mr Zapatero turn down Catalonia's new statute? ""He will never say no. That is why he is so well considered here. He understands the plural reality of Spain,"" says Mr Maragall. He does not want an independent Catalonia, but he points to growing acceptance of federalism. A recent article in El Pais, by its former editor, Juan Luis Cebrian, called on Spaniards to overcome fears of the word ""federal"". ""The statute does not have to be particular,"" says Mr Maragall, adding that ""the word nation is polysemic"". But like any good Catalan, he seeks more control of money. He wants to collect all taxes and pay Madrid only for central services, plus a small amount for other regions. 
Some Catalan nationalists might accept federalism, though Basque nationalists want a ""free state"" associated with Spain. If Mr Carod-Rovira has his way, Catalonia will be independent in 15 years. But even he says this is not a priority. Demonised by the right for having once spoken to ETA, Mr Carod-Rovira is now a regular interlocutor of the government in Madrid. He thinks Catalonia is on a journey to independence, and he is using the Socialists to get there. Mr Maragall, well versed in the ambiguous language of regional nationalism, is relaxed. ""They [the nationalists] can be seduced,"" he says. 
Mr Zapatero's overtures to ETA may well fail, after recent ETA bombings. But it is Catalonia that will really test whether, for all his fondness for dialogue and negotiation, Mr Zapatero has, as Spaniards like to say, the trousers for the job.

ALL of Europe, it seems, is fretting about its Muslim population. Spain's is relatively small--less than a million--yet no country has a more complex relationship with Islam. Until two years ago, the muezzin's cry ""Allahu akbar"" had not been heard in Granada since the reconquista and the expulsion of the last Moorish king in 1492. But then a mosque was erected in the Albaicin quarter near the Alhambra. For the mainly Spanish converts to Islam who built it, this was the dawn of a new era: as a mosque spokesman put it, ""the seeds of Islam were planted long ago, and now they are flourishing once again."" 
Although some traditionalists resisted the mosque, it is not the ""heritage"" strain of Islam that really preys on Spanish minds: it is the new, fundamentalist variety. This was brought home most shockingly after Islamist terrorists bombed the trains in Madrid in March 2004. Now the London bombings have revived fears. Shortly after the Madrid attacks it seemed that Spain might follow France's example by waging war on radical Islam. The interior minister, Jose Antonio Alonso, announced plans for more police in cities with large Muslim populations, to crack down on mosque-building and jihad-preaching imams. But in keeping with the conciliatory nature of the new Socialist government of Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero, these plans have been shelved.
Instead, a board has been set up for the Foundation of Pluralism and Peaceful Coexistence, based on accords signed between the government and Islamic, Jewish and Protestant representatives in 1992. Mercedes Rico Carabias, director-general of religious affairs and member of the board, insists that Spain has moved away from the restrictive French model of allowing only state-approved mosques. ""It is very important that the Muslim community is not put under suspicion,"" she says. Instead, she hopes to give Islam the same status as other religions. ""In Spain, the problem is plurality. We have now changed from being a totally Catholic country, and we have to respect that.""
The chief task of the foundation is to bring Islam into mainstream society by such means as paying for social programmes and encouraging imams to learn Spanish. Groups such as the Moroccan Immigrant Workers' Association had complained that financing of mosques was in the hands of Saudi-backed imams who preached radical Islam. The government wants public financing of mosques, but this is against the law. Ms Rico says that ""we must find another way, either with private or international money, to finance mosques in the future."" Even secular academics, such as Joan-Francesc Pont Clemente, at Barcelona University, agree. ""An absolute separation between church and state would not be useful,"" he says. ""Above all, since Islam has appeared as an important religion. We cannot close our eyes to Islam and end up letting it be financed entirely by Saudi Arabia or radicals.""
Spain's relationship with Muslims remains loaded with historical baggage. The vision of the country as a bulwark against barbarism, the expulsion of the Moors and the persecution of Muslim Spanish converts by the Inquisition are all cherished by both the right and the Catholic church. Their views were bolstered by the call from al-Qaeda, both before and after the Madrid bombs, for a holy war to ""liberate al-Andalus"". Jose Maria Aznar, the centre-right prime minister whose party was swept from power after the bombings, also calls on history. ""There are those who think that the Madrid attacks are related to the support given by the Spanish government to the Iraq war,"" he said in a speech in Washington, DC, last year. ""The problem with al-Qaeda came from before that--as long ago as 1,300 years.""
Attitudes on both sides remain ambivalent, however. Surveys have repeatedly shown that North Africans top the charts of people that Spaniards most distrust. Last year there were violent protests in at least three towns against the opening of ""garage-mosques"". Yet another recent survey, in El Pais, put Moroccan men first as Spanish women's preferred choice of marital partners among foreigners. The admirable al-Andalus notion of convivencia, or peaceful coexistence, is once again challenging Spain.

SPANIARDS have a phrase to describe the attitude of the country's media giants as they await the government's decision on the allocation of digital television licences: ""callarse como una puta"", to shut up like a whore. Why publish a report that may offend the Socialist government of Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero, if it could jeopardise your share of the digital cake? This was what one journalist was told by his bosses when he asked why his report describing Tony Blair's lukewarm reception of Mr Zapatero's plan to cure the ills of Islamic radicalism through an ""alliance of civilisations"" had not been published. 
In a country whose bestselling newspapers are mostly football-oriented, it is the all-powerful television that really matters. Mr Zapatero's government has caused considerable upset by appearing to lean too far towards the leftish Grupo Prisa, run by Jess Polanco. The group, which owns the newspaper El Pais, runs the country's only analogue pay-television channel, Canal Plus, through its sister company, Sogecable (this monopoly arose from a licence given by a previous Socialist prime minister, Felipe Gonzalez). Until the analogue shutdown and conversion to digital, planned for 2010, the government will allow Canal Plus to broadcast without the requirement for a set-top decoder, with the exception of a few high-value programmes such as football coverage. 
Competitors complain that this will enable Sogecable to gain an unfair advantage, because it will have a chance to win a much bigger audience before the analogue shutdown, while still maintaining its existing subscriber base. In what seems sure to be an overcrowded field, the government has hinted that it will grant two digital licences apiece to the existing broadcasters (Sogecable, Telecinco, Antena 3, Veo TV and Net TV); another to an analogue station yet to be granted a concession during the transition phase; and a further two licences in 2010. 
The government has presented the plan as essentially neutral and technical, but the centre-right opposition People's Party (PP) is concerned that Grupo Prisa is in fact becoming an unassailable force in the radio, television and newspaper market. As the PP knows from its own experience, political control of the media is a vice that is hard to kick. Only last week, the PP president of the Madrid region, Esperanza Aguirre, dished out local television broadcasting licences to sympathisers ranging from the Roman Catholic Church to right-wing media barons.
With the private television market being carved up in a predictably partisan way, what of Mr Zapatero's plan to put an end to government interference in state television and radio? It looks likely to fizzle out too. A council of wise men, convened to find ways of creating a more independent operation, has submitted a report. But few have hopes for any great change so long as state television depends on government grants, and its director-general is chosen by a parliamentary committee.

DESPITE their people's dour and thrifty reputation, Catalan politicians are excited by one thing--autonomy.

MANY countries have complex political systems that reflect their past more than their present. But Italy's politics is unusually hard to fathom--just as its governments have been unusually fragile. In fact, considering the umpteen governments and prime ministers the country has got through, the system was for many years surprisingly stable.
Until the 1990s, Italian politics was dominated by two parties: the Christian Democrats and the Communists. Because by common consent during the cold war the Communists were kept out of government, every administration from 1946 to the early 1980s was led by a Christian Democrat. There followed a decade of coalitions, all of which included the Christian Democrats, but some of which were led by a Republican, Giovanni Spadolini, and others by a Socialist, Bettino Craxi.
This stable system was blown apart by three events that reverberate still. The first was the collapse of Soviet communism in the late 1980s, which led to a split in the Italian Communist Party. The second, starting in Milan in early 1992, was a series of bribery cases known as tangentopoli (bribesville), led by a group of magistrates who became known as mani pulite (clean hands). These cases led to the conviction and flight of Mr Craxi, as well as to the demise of most of the old parties. The third event grew out of the second: the decision by Silvio Berlusconi, a media magnate, to enter politics and found a new party, Forza Italia (roughly, ""Go, Italy!"").
Thanks in part to his money and his media empire, and in part to Italians' disillusionment with the old system, Mr Berlusconi enjoyed instant success. His centre-right grouping won the election in 1994, only a few months after the establishment of Forza Italia. But his government lasted only eight months before being brought down by one of his allies, Umberto Bossi's Northern League. 
The first Berlusconi government was followed by a technocrat-led one. The next three governments were headed by centre-left prime ministers, the first of whom, Romano Prodi, led his ""Olive Tree"" coalition to victory over Mr Berlusconi's ""House of Liberties"" in the 1996 election. Mr Prodi brought in painful budget cuts and a special tax to ensure that Italy got into the euro, but the coalition then suffered a fit of internal squabbling. Mr Prodi was ousted and, in May 2001, Mr Berlusconi's House of Liberties coalition won a convincing majority over the Olive Tree coalition in both houses of parliament.
Go, Berlusconi!
This was the moment that Italian business had been waiting for. Here, at last, was a coalition of the right with sufficient political clout to bring in long-overdue reforms. Yet, as we have seen, they were destined to be disappointed. The House of Liberties coalition has implemented reform only in limited areas, and the economy's poor performance and the country's loss of competitiveness have continued unchecked. Budget deficits have been kept down mainly by one-off measures. And for the past 18 months or so, the centre-right has been trounced every time Italians have been allowed near a ballot box, starting with the European elections in June 2004 and culminating in the rout at the regional elections last April, when the centre-left won every region being contested except Lombardy and Veneto. 
This dismal performance has four explanations. The first is that, right from the start, the Berlusconi government was distracted by the time and energy it devoted to measures to deal with the prime minister's own interests and to fend off judicial cases against him (see box later in this article). These included laws to downgrade the offence of false accounting, to make it harder to use evidence from abroad, to provide for cases to be moved to a different court if there is any suspicion of judicial bias, and to shorten the statute of limitations after which offences are automatically expunged. To top it all, in mid-2003 a new law was passed to give the prime minister, as well as four of his associates, blanket immunity from prosecution while in office. This law was, deservedly, struck down by Italy's constitutional court.
The second reason that reform has proved difficult is the state of the economy. As other European countries have found, it is much harder to deregulate product markets or promote more competition when there is little or no growth. Low growth also confounds the budget arithmetic and leaves no scope for higher spending or tax cuts to cushion the short-term impact of changes. The catch-22 is, of course, that reforms become essential precisely when the economy has run out of steam. The Berlusconi government is not alone in Europe in failing to resolve this conundrum.
A third factor is, however, more peculiar to Italy. The country has moved towards a bipolar system of two broad groups, the centre-right and the centre-left, in part thanks to an electoral reform in the 1990s which provided for some 75% of the seats in parliament to be elected on a first-past-the-post basis. This was meant to discourage splinter parties, yet the influence of smaller parties remains disproportionately strong. It may even increase if, as seems likely, the government succeeds in changing the electoral law to move back to full proportional representation. The opposition has cried foul over this reform, which seems tailor-made to disadvantage the centre-left. As things stand, it will also introduce a complicated system of thresholds for representation in parliament the effect of which on smaller parties is not yet clear. But most parties seem resigned to the new system.
The big problem, as Mr Siniscalco knows from bitter experience, it that pushing through potentially unpopular reforms is extremely hard when every party within a coalition has a veto. Although Forza Italia is the biggest party on the centre-right, Mr Berlusconi has had to keep on board the National Alliance, the Northern League and the Union of Centre and Christian Democrats. Each of these has its own constituency to protect, and none is a natural supporter of free markets. 
The fourth point is perhaps the most important: that Mr Berlusconi himself is not a true believer in free markets either. His own business success was built on the creation of near-monopolies that, far from being attacked by antitrust authorities, benefited from political friendships. The most notorious example is his Mediaset television empire, which needed the strong support of a Socialist leader, Mr Craxi. But even his early business career depended on favours, such as diverting the flightpath out of Linate airport to boost the value of his properties near Milan. Mr Berlusconi's instincts are those of a trader in favours and privileges, not of a competitor in unfettered markets. That is a useful qualification for a politician, but less so for building a successful liberal economy.
Despite all this, the Berlusconi government has done some things right, and not only in labour-market and pension reform. The education minister, Letizia Moratti, has worked hard to promote research and to improve Italian universities, though there is still a long way to go. As one Italian university professor disarmingly puts it, ""the nice thing about this job is that you don't have to do any work."" Pay and promotion are largely determined by seniority, and Italy has proportionately fewer foreign academics than most other countries. Recent street protests in many cities led by university professors denouncing Mrs Moratti must be a sign that she is doing something right.
America's friend, and Russia's
On the whole, the government's foreign policy must be counted a success too. Mr Berlusconi braved the wrath of many of his EU allies and his own public opinion by sending troops to join America and Britain in Iraq, though he is now trying to argue that he had misgivings about the war and sought to talk George Bush out of it. His government has generally been more assertive about Italy's role in the world than its predecessors. Within the EU, it has been less deferential towards France and Germany. If Mr Prodi returns to office, he is likely to switch the emphasis back towards backing the Franco-German duo.
Mr Berlusconi's government has been more staunchly pro-American (and pro-Israel) than most previous ones. The one blot in foreign policy has been Mr Berlusconi's partiality for Russia's Vladimir Putin, whom he appears to see as another businessman-turned-politician under unfair attack from the media. During Italy's six-monthly presidency of the EU in 2003, Mr Berlusconi caused consternation in Brussels by refusing to criticise Mr Putin at an EU-Russia summit meeting in Rome. He also lost international credibility for his chairing of the EU summit in Brussels in December 2003 that failed to agree on the text of a draft EU constitution.
On defence, although like many other European countries Italy still spends too little, it has in the past few years made a useful contribution in places such as Kosovo and Afghanistan as well as in Iraq. The defence minister, Antonio Martino, is also seeing through a plan to abolish conscription and to overhaul the arms-procurement system. If Mr Prodi returns to office, there is a serious risk that his government might choose to pull troops out of Iraq too quickly, as Spain's then new prime minister, Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero, did after March 2004.
Mr Martino is one of Italy's few avowed liberals, but his influence on economic policy has, sadly, been small. Still, the government has at least brought in some tax cuts. Its stewardship of the public finances, however, has been dreadful. It inherited a useful primary budget surplus (ie, before interest payments) of as much as 5% of GDP, but it has frittered that away to zero (see chart 5). Moreover, although Mr Tremonti's repeated tax amnesties have seemed to keep annual budget deficits within bounds, the price of this may have been to increase Italy's already high level of tax evasion. Opposition politicians claim that tax evasion now adds up to as much as euro200 billion ($234 billion) a year. This bears heavily on those in paid employment, who find they have to pay higher taxes than they otherwise would.
Nor has the government made much of a dent in public spending. It is not hard to come up with ideas for cuts, just as it is not hard to find things to privatise. Giovanni Tamburi, an investment consultant based in Milan, has produced a detailed list of possible asset sales, including of foundations that still own some banks, as well as a programme of liberalisation. Such measures would, on his estimates, yield as much as euro200 billion a year. Some of these assets are, admittedly, in the hands of local authorities, but it remains striking how reluctant Mr Berlusconi has been to sell anything. Patronage, it seems, retains its allure.
Another undesirable legacy of the Berlusconi government is a devaluation of civic and public ethics. When a prime minister attacks his country's magistrates as part of a left-wing conspiracy, passes laws that benefit his own interests and issues repeated amnesties for people who have evaded taxes and ignored planning controls, he sends a message to the average citizen: do not bother to obey the rules. The judicial system badly needs modernising to speed up the processing of cases and reduce queues, and his government has introduced reforms which it claims will do this, but no one else seems to agree. 
Would the opposition be a big improvement? It would undoubtedly encourage people to be more law-abiding, although even Mr Prodi has had minor brushes with scandal. Yet there is something dispiriting about the fact that Italian voters next April are likely to face the same choice as they did ten years earlier, between two candidates in their late 60s. Mr Prodi says many of the right things about introducing more competition and liberalisation, but you would hardly call him a liberal or a reformer. Moreover, like Mr Berlusconi, he will be hostage to other parties in his own coalition. He notes that, unlike in 1996, the Communists under Fausto Bertinotti are now formally part of the centre-left coalition, as opposed to backing it from outside, and denies that he is some sort of Mr ""Prodinotti"". But he knows that he will not find it easy to keep all the small left-leaning parties behind him.
He has made several efforts to increase his chances. The first was to suggest that the parties of the left should campaign on a single platform. This was shot down by one of his closest supporters, Francesco Rutelli of the Democracy and Freedom Party. However, the idea may now be revived, partly thanks to Mr Prodi's second plan: to hold a primary of all Italian voters to endorse the centre-left's candidate for the election. This was duly put into effect, and last month Mr Prodi overwhelmingly won the ballot, on a surprisingly high turnout. That has left him rather better placed not merely to face Mr Berlusconi but perhaps also to keep a grip on his own coalition if it wins.
What next?
Mr Berlusconi now seems sure to be the candidate facing Mr Prodi. Earlier this year he flirted with the idea of stepping down to make way for somebody more popular to lead his alliance, most likely Pier Ferdinando Casini, the speaker of the Chamber of Deputies. But he changed his mind, and after a few hiccups and with a few reservations, his coalition partners now seem to endorse his candidacy.
What would happen to the centre-right if Mr Berlusconi loses the election? Presumably he would quit, and few would then expect Forza Italia to survive in its present form. There are no obvious successors to lead the centre-right. Mr Casini is a possibility, but a more plausible candidate for the leadership might be the present foreign minister and leader of the National Alliance, Gianfranco Fini.
Mr Fini is certainly a man to watch. When he first joined Mr Berlusconi's government in 1994, he was only just emerging from the neo-fascist MSI party, which formed the basis of the National Alliance. He once declared that Mussolini had been the greatest statesman of the 20th century. But for the past ten years he has been increasingly distancing himself from this past, denouncing Mussolini, cultivating Israel and serving as a briskly efficient foreign minister. Along the way he has shed some of his harder-line supporters, including the Duce's grand-daughter, Alessandra, and cemented his position as the most popular leader of the centre-right.
The only political leader who is even more popular than Mr Fini is Walter Veltroni, an ex-Communist who served as culture minister under Mr Prodi in the 1990s and is now a successful mayor of Rome. When Mr Berlusconi and Mr Prodi eventually retire, Mr Fini and Mr Veltroni may be well set to take over as the next generation of political leaders.
One thing that Italy lacks is a truly liberal-minded party. The closest are Giorgio La Malfa's Republican Party, a tiny group that has thrown in its lot with the centre-right; and the Radical Party of Marco Pannella and Emma Bonino, which is not now represented in parliament. Mario Monti, at Bocconi University, caused a stir recently by questioning the ability of either coalition to implement reforms. Many saw this as a call for a new centre party, but Mr Monti seems to have no serious plans for one. More's the pity: Italy badly needs more believers in the free market.
Caption: Prodi waits for the call",230,Spain,"Why Italian politics is impossible
MANY countries have complex political systems that reflect their past more than their present. But Italy's politics is unusually hard to fathom--just as its governments have been unusually fragile. In fact, considering the umpteen governments and prime ministers the country has got through, the system was for many years surprisingly stable.
Until the 1990s, Italian politics was dominated by two parties: the Christian Democrats and the Communists. Because by common consent during the cold war the Communists were kept out of government, every administration from 1946 to the early 1980s was led by a Christian Democrat. There followed a decade of coalitions, all of which included the Christian Democrats, but some of which were led by a Republican, Giovanni Spadolini, and others by a Socialist, Bettino Craxi.
This stable system was blown apart by three events that reverberate still. The first was the collapse of Soviet communism in the late 1980s, which led to a split in the Italian Communist Party. The second, starting in Milan in early 1992, was a series of bribery cases known as tangentopoli (bribesville), led by a group of magistrates who became known as mani pulite (clean hands). These cases led to the conviction and flight of Mr Craxi, as well as to the demise of most of the old parties. The third event grew out of the second: the decision by Silvio Berlusconi, a media magnate, to enter politics and found a new party, Forza Italia (roughly, ""Go, Italy!"").
Thanks in part to his money and his media empire, and in part to Italians' disillusionment with the old system, Mr Berlusconi enjoyed instant success. His centre-right grouping won the election in 1994, only a few months after the establishment of Forza Italia. But his government lasted only eight months before being brought down by one of his allies, Umberto Bossi's Northern League. 
The first Berlusconi government was followed by a technocrat-led one. The next three governments were headed by centre-left prime ministers, the first of whom, Romano Prodi, led his ""Olive Tree"" coalition to victory over Mr Berlusconi's ""House of Liberties"" in the 1996 election. Mr Prodi brought in painful budget cuts and a special tax to ensure that Italy got into the euro, but the coalition then suffered a fit of internal squabbling. Mr Prodi was ousted and, in May 2001, Mr Berlusconi's House of Liberties coalition won a convincing majority over the Olive Tree coalition in both houses of parliament.
Go, Berlusconi!
This was the moment that Italian business had been waiting for. Here, at last, was a coalition of the right with sufficient political clout to bring in long-overdue reforms. Yet, as we have seen, they were destined to be disappointed. The House of Liberties coalition has implemented reform only in limited areas, and the economy's poor performance and the country's loss of competitiveness have continued unchecked. Budget deficits have been kept down mainly by one-off measures. And for the past 18 months or so, the centre-right has been trounced every time Italians have been allowed near a ballot box, starting with the European elections in June 2004 and culminating in the rout at the regional elections last April, when the centre-left won every region being contested except Lombardy and Veneto.

CAN Italy reform itself, or is it doomed to decline? It is always dangerous to project a trend set by a few years' under- (or over-) performance far into the future. Both Japan and Germany, once thought unstoppable and then, not so many years later, irredeemable, now seem poised to recover, and Britain's sorry post-war performance has been forgotten in the euphoria of the past 15 years. Italy's problems are as deep-rooted as any: its potential growth first slowed some two decades ago, and its demographics have looked ominous for many years. 
But time can be a great healer. In the long run, Italians' natural flair, inventiveness and creativity should be enough to rescue what is still a rich country in every sense. After all, this is where much of European capitalism began, complete with modern banking and double-entry book-keeping. The country's plethora of small firms and its lack of big companies may seem a weakness right now, but in future it might prove an advantage again, providing flexibility to cope with change.
In the short term, though, there are good reasons for remaining gloomy about Italy. As in the rest of the euro zone, only more so, the country desperately needs structural reforms to liberalise markets, inject greater competition and shake up a bloated, inefficient and sometimes corrupt public sector. Currency devaluation to offset deteriorating competitiveness is no longer an option, and the vulnerability of small manufacturing firms to cheaper imports from Asia, especially China, has become painfully clear.
Faced with such huge structural problems, Mr Berlusconi's centre-right coalition government has done nothing like enough to put matters right. Unfortunately, even if the centre-left under Romano Prodi wins the election next April--which looks likely, but by no means certain--it too will find that reforms are hard to get past some of the more recalcitrant small parties in its coalition, to say nothing of Italy's entrenched special interests.
In some ways, things may need to get worse before they get better. Giuliano Amato, a canny centre-left politician who served as prime minister in the early 1990s and again in 2000-01, observes that ""timing is an essential variable in economic matters."" In his first term he was able to push through a ruthless budget, slashing spending and drastically reducing the deficit, because Italy's ejection from the European exchange-rate mechanism in September 1992 produced a consensus that tough measures were unavoidable. That budget laid the foundation for the measures introduced by Mr Prodi's 1996-98 government to ensure that Italy could join the euro from the start.
Mr Monti at Bocconi University offers a similar conclusion. He says that Italian governments can take tough decisions, but only if two conditions are met: there must be both a visible emergency and strong pressure from outside. In the 1990s, the emergency was the impact of the fiscal position on interest rates and the exchange rate; the outside pressure stemmed from the desire to get into the euro.
Now, says Mr Monti, such a moment of truth is lacking. Italy is suffering from slow growth and a steady deterioration of its competitiveness, but both started long before the Berlusconi government came to office. As for external pressure, the European Central Bank, the European Commission and the financial markets are all doing their best to apply some. But Italian enthusiasm for things European has cooled markedly, and membership of the euro has had the perverse effect of dissipating some of the market signals that might otherwise have forced change.
Italy needs to look to the example of other countries that have successfully introduced reforms, and not just Britain. A more telling case across the Mediterranean is Spain. Thirty years ago, the notion that Spain, as it emerged hesitantly from the Franco era, might set Italy an example would have seemed laughable. The Spanish economy is still far smaller than Italy's, and living standards are lower--but they are catching up. The Socialist government of Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero that came to power in March last year has kept up the momentum of economic reform inherited from its centre-right predecessor.
The gain in Spain
Spain's public finances are also a lot healthier than Italy's, which is one reason why it has been able to afford such impressive infrastructure investments as the high-speed railway to Seville or the burgeoning airport at Madrid (bigger than any in Italy). The biggest Spanish companies, such as its two largest banks and Telefonica, have built up a stronger global presence than their Italian counterparts. 
The differences between the two countries are palpable even to the passing visitor. There is a buzz of optimism in Madrid and Barcelona that often seems lacking in Rome and Naples. When the Guggenheim Museum in New York was looking for a new foreign outpost a few years back, a natural choice would have been Venice, which already has a Peggy Guggenheim gallery. But it spent years dithering over the site, so the prize was snatched away by Bilbao in Spain's Basque country. 
Italy is not about to be overtaken by Spain. But if it is to stay ahead for long, it needs bolder political leaders who are prepared to override opposition to reform even in the absence of an immediate crisis. At the end of ""I Pagliacci"", Leoncavallo's verismo opera about Sicily in the 1870s, Canio the clown, who has just stabbed his wife and her lover to death, concludes: ""La commedia e finita."" It is time for Italy, too, to get serious.

He says that Italian governments can take tough decisions, but only if two conditions are met: there must be both a visible emergency and strong pressure from outside. In the 1990s, the emergency was the impact of the fiscal position on interest rates and the exchange rate; the outside pressure stemmed from the desire to get into the euro.
Now, says Mr Monti, such a moment of truth is lacking. Italy is suffering from slow growth and a steady deterioration of its competitiveness, but both started long before the Berlusconi government came to office. As for external pressure, the European Central Bank, the European Commission and the financial markets are all doing their best to apply some. But Italian enthusiasm for things European has cooled markedly, and membership of the euro has had the perverse effect of dissipating some of the market signals that might otherwise have forced change.
Italy needs to look to the example of other countries that have successfully introduced reforms, and not just Britain. A more telling case across the Mediterranean is Spain. Thirty years ago, the notion that Spain, as it emerged hesitantly from the Franco era, might set Italy an example would have seemed laughable. The Spanish economy is still far smaller than Italy's, and living standards are lower--but they are catching up. The Socialist government of Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero that came to power in March last year has kept up the momentum of economic reform inherited from its centre-right predecessor.
The gain in Spain
Spain's public finances are also a lot healthier than Italy's, which is one reason why it has been able to afford such impressive infrastructure investments as the high-speed railway to Seville or the burgeoning airport at Madrid (bigger than any in Italy). The biggest Spanish companies, such as its two largest banks and Telefonica, have built up a stronger global presence than their Italian counterparts. 
The differences between the two countries are palpable even to the passing visitor. There is a buzz of optimism in Madrid and Barcelona that often seems lacking in Rome and Naples. When the Guggenheim Museum in New York was looking for a new foreign outpost a few years back, a natural choice would have been Venice, which already has a Peggy Guggenheim gallery. But it spent years dithering over the site, so the prize was snatched away by Bilbao in Spain's Basque country. 
Italy is not about to be overtaken by Spain. But if it is to stay ahead for long, it needs bolder political leaders who are prepared to override opposition to reform even in the absence of an immediate crisis. At the end of ""I Pagliacci"", Leoncavallo's verismo opera about Sicily in the 1870s, Canio the clown, who has just stabbed his wife and her lover to death, concludes: ""La commedia e finita."" It is time for Italy, too, to get serious.

WHEN a general talks of the army stepping in to uphold a country's territorial integrity, any democrat should worry. When the country is Spain, which emerged from Franco's dictatorship only 30 years ago and saw off an attempted coup as recently as 1981, the worries should multiply.
That is why Spain's government was right to arrest General Jose Mena Algado, head of the Spanish army, last weekend, after he said publicly that Catalonia's new constitutional statute, which gives it both more autonomy and recognition as a ""nation"", might necessitate military intervention. He cited article 8 of the Spanish constitution, which gives the army a mission to guarantee the country's ""integrity and constitutional order"". The Catalan statute, overwhelmingly approved by the regional parliament last September, is now being debated by the Spanish parliament in Madrid ()see page 40.
Spain's 1978 constitution devolved many powers that were centralised under Franco to the 17 ""autonomous regions"", though it did so unevenly. The Basque country and Catalonia, which have the most autonomy, have long agitated for more; a sizeable minority in both regions wants to move towards independence. In the Basque case, debate has been disfigured by the violence of ETA, though solid police work has weakened this terrorist group. Yet most governments in Madrid have intransigently refused to consider any more autonomy for the regions, let alone to contemplate eventual independence. The willingness of the Socialist government under Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero, elected in March 2004, to negotiate with the Basque country and Catalonia was a welcome change. 
There are respectable arguments against Mr Zapatero's flexibility, even so. Nationalists will never be satisfied by concessions such as a separate judiciary or tax-raising powers; because they always ask for more, it might be better tactically to rule out even limited concessions. Besides, Mr Zapatero's negotiating position is undermined because, in Madrid, his government depends on the votes of left-wing Catalan nationalists; while in Barcelona, the Socialist-led regional government is in coalition with the same nationalist party. Moreover, there is a big financial problem. The Basque country and, especially, Catalonia are among Spain's wealthiest regions. Give them too much fiscal autonomy and they may pull out of the desirable process of transferring money from rich to poor parts of the country. Indeed, a wish to limit net transfers to Madrid has been a driving force behind the new Catalan statute.
Yet Mr Zapatero is still right to favour negotiations. The high-handed refusal of the previous People's Party government, under Jose Maria Aznar, even to talk to Basque and Catalan nationalists has merely served to stoke secessionist fervour in both regions. Other countries have discovered that the best way to defuse demands for independence may be to concede more autonomy and even, if need be, to recognise claims to nationhood. Now that they have their own parliament, fewer people in Scotland want a complete break from London. Quebec's demands for independence have to some degree been defanged by Canada's Clarity Act of 2000, which sets out a procedure under which Ottawa would negotiate with any province that votes for independence by a clear majority.
Clarity needed
Because it is the richest part of the country, Catalonia presents more problems than Scotland or Quebec, which are net recipients from central government. Yet since only a minority of Catalan voters seem genuinely to want independence, a bit of pandering to nationalist feeling could still work wonders, even if it involved accepting most of the new Catalan statute and, if necessary, changing Spain's 1978 constitution. Indeed, article 8 of the 1978 text surely needs amendment anyway to remove even the flimsiest excuse for a military intervention. A modern democracy should be capable of accommodating regional autonomy, and even a clear wish for independence. But it should never be intimidated by a general.",230,Spain,"It is better to talk about rather than just reject demands for more autonomy

Mr Bono will now ask the cabinet to sack him. One irony is that his comments were in the tradition of burlesque patriotism that Mr Bono himself so often displays.

The opposition People's Party (PP), which says the plan is unconstitutional, voted no and has tried to block its progress. A PP spokesman said that General Mena's latest pronunciamentito was inevitable in the prevailing climate. The PP leader, Mariano Rajoy, argues that ""the whole Catalan statute is built on a false assumption that Catalonia is a nation, so it is sovereign...and has a right to decide by itself its relations with the Spanish state.""

Socialist-ruled Andalusia is toying with a definition of itself as a ""nation"". One wag suggested that such a putative al-Andalus might see Osama bin Laden as its spiritual father. A similar reform in the PP-governed Valencia provoked less reaction. 
Mr Zapatero has declared that the Catalan statute is unacceptable in its present form. But he seems to have persuaded most Spaniards that the PP is scaremongering. ""When the Catalan statute is approved and in force, I will remind you [ie, the PP] that you were wrong and deceived the citizens, because nothing is at risk,"" he said. In keeping with his instinct for compromise, Mr Zapatero has told Catalans that the statute heralds a new dawn, yet at the same time assured Spaniards that nothing of substance will change. But the conservative newspaper ABC noted that the statute deepens ""the abyss between the two visions of Spain held by Zapatero and Rajoy,"" and also pointed to its ""elastic, imprecise and ambiguous"" language.
The final version of the statute is likely to be substantially altered; more than 500 amendments have been proposed. Even many Socialists have threatened to oppose it unless it is watered down. The toughest wrangling is over how much tax autonomy to cede to Catalonia (Socialist-run Extremadura and Andalusia are both anxious to keep fiscal transfers from Spain's richest region) and the use of the word ""nation"". The Catalans want to keep 90% of their income taxes; Madrid may offer a compromise of 50%. Mr Zapatero has also suggested ""national identity"" as a better phrase than ""nation"".

AT THE start of the year, Spain became the latest European country to ban smoking in many public places. Its red-eyed, gravel-voiced smokers are incensed. Sergi Arola, the (non-smoking) owner of Madrid's La Broche restaurant, has enforced the ban, but not without rancour. ""Why are they attacking public consumption? I only hope that one day a vegetarian minister is not going to ban steaks. With this measure we are heading towards ending the drink and the tertulia (cafe debates). To have an armagnac without a cigar is unthinkable."" 
The Socialist government of Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero decided on a ban because smoking is the biggest killer in Spain, with 50,000 deaths a year. Some 30% of Spaniards smoke; Spain is the European Union's second-biggest consumer of tobacco per head. Smoking is now banned in offices, shops, schools, hospitals, public transport and theatres. Owners of bars and restaurants bigger than 100 square metres (1,000 square feet) have eight months to install separate smoking areas with ventilation systems. Smaller places must put up signs saying whether they are smoke-free. 
The country's notoriously smoke-clad civil servants have had their ashtrays withdrawn. Bilbao town hall is distributing 20,000 ashtrays in an attempt to stop workers from chucking their butts in the street. 
Similar bans have been imposed in Ireland, Italy and Norway. Britain plans to ban smoking in pubs and restaurants from 2007, with an exemption only for pubs that do not serve food. But compared with other European countries, the Spanish law is quite liberal--and it may prove to have little effect.
A government-sponsored opinion poll in November showed that more than 77% of respondents backed the ban. But 69% think it will be hard to enforce. Why? Most Spaniards answer that whoever makes the law, makes a loophole. The Spanish hotel federation points out that 90% of small bars have opted to continue to allow customers to smoke. There is also much dispute over what exactly constitutes a workplace. The health ministry has been inundated with calls from people wanting to know where they can light up. In Valencia a cafeteria located inside a government building reversed its initial ban after its habitual customers deserted it. In short, little may change for the determined smoker--and most Spanish bars will stay full of stale cigarette smoke.

SPAIN'S prime minister, Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero, this week boldly went where no predecessor had for 25 years: to the north African enclaves of Ceuta and Melilla. His two-day visit fulfilled a pledge last November, when thousands of immigrants tried to reach European territory over razor-wire fences. Eleven were killed, and human-rights groups attacked the Spanish for sending back others whom the Moroccans abandoned in the desert. 
But times have changed. This week, Mr Zapatero was mobbed by Africans at a refugee centre. He stressed his commitment to ""social initiatives"" which would turn Spain into a shining example of humane welfare policies and respect for human rights. He had another agenda too. His first port of call was Melilla, now a hotbed of military disenchantment over Spain's restive regions. Few Spaniards will have missed the echo: it was from Spanish Morocco that Franco launched his coup in 1936. Mr Zapatero's visit was, in effect, a counter to right-wing hostility to greater autonomy for Catalonia.
The trouble began a few weeks ago when a general spoke of ""serious consequences"" if the government ceded too much to the Catalans. He was sacked, but a captain in Melilla warned the prime minister of broad unease over how Spain was being ""dismembered"". Last week the leader of the failed 1981 coup, Colonel Antonio Tejero, backed calls for a referendum on Catalonia, saying in a letter to a Melilla newspaper: ""They [the Socialists] are playing with the integrity of Spain...they are trying to shatter the Spanish crown."" 
Mr Zapatero reassured the colony's 70,000 people of Spain's commitment to the territory. ""The government is very conscious of the singularity of Melilla, which needs special attention,"" he added. Because Spain has good relations with Morocco, which claims the enclaves, Mr Zapatero got only a mild rebuke from Rabat. But his words were not enough for the opposition at home, which wanted him to talk up the enclaves' espanolidad, or Spanishness. 
Nicknamed Bambi by detractors and widely criticised as a lightweight, Mr Zapatero may now be finding his feet. His visit to North Africa has deflected attacks from the right. And thanks to deft bargaining by his negotiator, Alfredo Perez Rubalcaba, he is close to an accord on Catalonia. Mr Rubalcaba's trick was to win support from Catalonia's conservative opposition, Convergence and Union. The latest draft recognises Catalonia as a ""nation"" in the preamble and gives it greater control over taxes. But it is a far cry from the radical text first proposed by the Catalans. 
This sleight of hand has not only wrongfooted the opposition; it has also sidelined the left-wing nationalists, who are threatening to quit Catalonia's ruling coalition. But their leader, Josep Lluis Carod-Rovira, is willing to continue talking.

THE trick with Italian foreign policy has always been to strike a balance between Europeanism and Atlanticism; between the voters' deep-felt commitment to European unity and their feelings for a country, the United States, that freed them from Nazi occupation, shielded them from Soviet encroachment and has also offered a new life to millions of their compatriots. Until 2003, this balance was quite easy to strike. Being a fervent European did not rule out being a loyal ally of America. But the war in Iraq created a starker choice. Just how stark is becoming clearer in the campaign for Italy's general election next month.
The prime minister, Silvio Berlusconi, has been George Bush's closest ally in Europe after Britain's Tony Blair. He may have chided the Americans over Guantanamo, and even expressed doubts about the wisdom of the war, but this was always from the standpoint of somebody who is fundamentally sympathetic to the Bush administration's world view. His misgivings did not stop him from sending the biggest contingent of coalition forces after those of Britain and America.
At the beginning of March, Mr Berlusconi duly got his reward, when he was given the rare honour of addressing Congress. His visit to Washington received blanket coverage on his own television channels--to such an extent that his centre-left opponents protested, unsuccessfully, to Italy's broadcasting authority.
The outlook of the centre-left, led by a former European Commission president, Romano Prodi, could hardly be more different. Its election programme refers to ""Europe"" 99 times but to the ""United States"" only twice. Indeed, it appears to see the superpower as a nuisance, arguing, for example, that ""to tackle the problems arising from the world's unipolar orientation, we must aim for an autonomous European defence [capability], even if always linked to the Atlantic Alliance, which is changing profoundly.""
Even so, Marta Dassu, director of Aspen Italia, a think-tank, says it is inconceivable that the mild-mannered Mr Prodi would prove an anti-American firebrand once in office. The Italian centre-left has learnt, notably from the experience of Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero in Spain, that there is more to lose than to gain from provoking the Americans. A Prodi government is more likely to model its foreign policy on Angela Merkel's in Germany. Crucially, notes Ms Dassu, ""withdrawal from Iraq is finished as a point of real debate"".
This was a matter of life and death in more ways than one. By offering Spain's voters the option of early withdrawal, the Spanish Socialists may unwittingly have given al-Qaeda an incentive to try to influence Spain's 2004 general election. The terrorists seized it with devastating effects when they bombed trains in Madrid days before the vote. Mr Prodi and his allies have dodged that trap by loudly demanding withdrawal while quietly agreeing it should be done in consultation with the Iraqi authorities--a position no different from the government's.
Indeed, it could be argued that the interests of al-Qaeda might now be better served by the return to office of such people as the Northern League's Roberto Calderoli, a former minister whose anti-Islamic outbursts last month sparked a riot in Libya, stirred by Islamic extremists, in which 14 people died. The ""theo-con"" streak on the Italian right is more pronounced than in, say, Germany or Spain. Conservative Roman Catholics such as Marcello Pera, a member of Mr Berlusconi's Forza Italia party who is speaker of the Senate, are big on defending Europe's Christian roots.
So is Pope Benedict XVI, with whom Mr Pera once wrote a book on the subject. This week, the centre-right was boosted when it was reported (and not denied) that the pontiff intended to welcome Mr Berlusconi to the Vatican ten days before polling day. After an outcry, the prime minister said he would not be going. He would, in any case, have been just one member of a delegation. But an impression was left that the pope favoured Mr Berlusconi.
That could prove invaluable. Polls consistently give the centre-left a 4-5% lead over the centre-right. But they also suggest that some 24-30% of voters remain undecided, and that a disproportionate number are practising Catholics.

IT IS the eternal Spanish rumour. But this time it may really come true. Several Spanish newspapers have confidently declared that ETA, the Basque terrorist group, is poised to call a ceasefire, bringing to an end 38 years of violence that has claimed over 800 lives. The prime minister, Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero, is among those who seem to think that something may happen. Spain is close to ""the beginning of the end"" of ETA, he declared last month. The talk is of a ceasefire by Easter.
Mr Zapatero has the backing of the Spanish parliament to open talks with ETA if it shows a ""clear will"" to give up violence. He also, however, has a problem. The opposition People's Party refuses to sanction any negotiations with ETA or anybody who represents it. It says a weakened ETA, which has killed nobody for over two years, must be forced to surrender unconditionally. ""It should be asphyxiated,"" sums up the party spokesman, Gabriel Elorriaga.
Traditionally, government and opposition have walked in step when confronting ETA. But this cross-party front is now in tatters, and that could stymie attempts to create a peace process. As other countries have found, any such process will be complex and long--so a People's Party government might, one day, have to take it on. ""I don't think one party can do it alone,"" says Kepa Aulestia, a Basque commentator.
There is no sign of the parties patching up their differences. Instead, the arguing is getting nastier. The People's Party is being ""vile"" and ""cowardly"", says the Socialist Party secretary, Jose Blanco. The Socialists are ""spitting"" in the faces of terrorist victims, retorts the People's Party's parliamentary spokesman, Eduardo Zaplana. Both sides use ETA's victims, who are also divided on what should happen next, as pawns in their political war.
Each party blames the other for the split. The People's Party claims that Mr Zapatero has broken the consensus and is trying to drag it somewhere it cannot go. The government points to the peace process in Northern Ireland, in which Britain's Conservative and Labour Parties both played their part. Mr Zapatero claims he was a loyal opposition leader who backed the policies of the former People's Party prime minister, Jose Maria Aznar. Now he wants the favour returned.
Could Mr Zapatero go ahead without the People's Party? He seems to think that he can, so long as ETA persuades most Spaniards that it is ready to give up the fight once and for all. He will seek legitimacy for whatever he does in parliament, where the People's Party looks increasingly lonely in its opposition.
The unknown quantity in the calculation is ETA itself. So far, its reply to the ceasefire rumours has been to plant more bombs--four more were found near roads this week. Is this just a last-minute effort to exert pressure before declaring a ceasefire? Old hands remember that previous rumours of talks with ETA saw a similar strategy of ""corpses on the table"". Yet, as the Basque Socialist leader, Patxi Lopez, told El Mundo last week, ""one single death in an ETA attack would bring this peace process to an end.""

SO IT finally happened. ETA, the Basque separatist group, this week announced the ceasefire that Spaniards have been expecting for months. The country can now start dreaming of a future without violence--at least for a while. The declaration of a ""permanent ceasefire"", made by three masked figures on a videotape, was greeted with cautious optimism by the prime minister, Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero. On March 23rd ETA followed its ceasefire announcement by calling for a peaceful solution to the Basque problem.
Yet the Spanish government has good reason to be cautious. ETA has not said that it is ready to hand over its weapons. Nor has it renounced, let alone denounced, the use of violence. There have been previous ETA ceasefires that have come and, lethally, gone. The most recent, in 1998, lasted for just 14 months.
Even so, Mr Zapatero has some reason for satisfaction. He has followed a clear policy of gradually encouraging ETA to lay down its arms and talk. He has won support in the Spanish parliament. And it has been done in the teeth of fierce opposition from the conservative People's Party, and amid accusations of betrayal by some ETA victims.
Basque peace could be a pay-off for Mr Zapatero's softly-softly approach to Spain's most enduring political problem: regional tensions in the Basque country and in Catalonia. His chief weapon has been his majority in the parliament in Madrid. He used it last year to throw out proposals from the Basque regional assembly for a new statute that would have made it a ""free associate"" with Spain. Now he is using it to negotiate a new Catalan statute of autonomy. Any future Basque settlement will go through the same vetting process.
Mr Zapatero may, however, still stumble, as the road ahead is highly uncertain. ETA might believe that it is now in a position to bargain for things it cannot hope to win. A separate Basque state carved out of four Spanish provinces and a chunk of south-west France is an impossible pipe-dream. ETA will also have to settle for something less than a full right to self-determination.
Moreover, the People's Party may stymie moves towards prisoner releases. Its leader, Mariano Rajoy, did not sound overjoyed about the ceasefire announcement. ""The only really important communique that ETA could give is one that announces its dissolution,"" he said.
A much weakened ETA has not killed since May 2003, when two police officers died in a booby-trapped car. However, ETA's internal structure remains a mystery, all the more so as frequent arrests by the Spanish and French police have forced it continually to reorganise its leadership. One important question is still unanswered: is there a hard-line faction (the Real ETA) ready to carry on the fight? ETA has had internal splits before. Mr Zapatero has been giving warnings of a ""long and difficult"" process ahead. He is surely right to do so.

The main Sunni Arab party has a clutch of ministries, raising hopes that it will persuade at least some of the insurgents to negotiate. The crucial defence and interior ministries are still waiting to be filled.
Ehud Olmert, Israel's prime minister, met President George Bush in Washington, where they agreed that Iran should be prevented from getting nuclear weapons. Mr Bush said America would ""come to Israel's aid"" if Iran attacked, and he praised Mr Olmert's ""bold"" plan to adjust Israel's borders unilaterally if attempts to agree them with the Palestinians failed.
Mahmoud Abbas, the Palestinian president, said he would call a referendum unless Hamas agreed to accept the pre-1967 borders of Israel. This came after violence between his Fatah faction and Hamas cost several lives in the Gaza Strip.
Lakhdar Brahimi, a UN official, went to Sudan to try to persuade the government in Khartoum to let a UN peacekeeping force into its western Darfur region. Violence has persisted there since a peace deal between the main rebel group and the government was signed three weeks ago.
In a tense run-up to elections due on July 30th, the government has told politicians in the Democratic Republic of Congo that they should not have more than 25 bodyguards each. 
Zimbabwe's inflation rate exceeded 1,000%. When Robert Mugabe came to power in 1980, Zimbabwe's dollar was worth $1.60; an American dollar is now officially worth 100,000 Zimbabwean dollars.

WILL Catalans turn out to vote, or will they head for the beach? After months of debate over a new charter of autonomy, many may choose the latter when it is put to a referendum on June 18th. Yet there is no doubt about the result: the charter will sail through. Only the conservative People's Party, harder-line separatists and a handful of anti-nationalist intellectuals are against.
Spain's Socialist prime minister, Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero, should emerge smiling. The People's Party predicts the disintegration of Spain after a ""yes"" vote. But Josep Duran i Lleida, spokesman of the moderate Catalan nationalist Convergence and Union coalition, which backs the charter, retorts that ""there is no danger of Spain falling apart, nor is this a first step towards independence."" Indeed, separatists complain that the charter is too weak--they wanted Catalonia formally recognised as a ""nation"". Other critics fret over a new duty for people to understand Catalan, which will now be obligatory for most public-sector jobs. Another complaint is that what is billed as Catalonia's ""constitution"" is so long. With 227 detailed articles, running to 57 pages, it rivals the European Union's failed constitution. 
But the new charter's biggest impact may be beyond Catalonia. This is only the start of a round of revising the charters of most of Spain's 17 autonomous regions. Catalonia has raised the bar. Other regions, which got fewer powers when the Spanish constitution was adopted in 1978, hope to catch up. Andalusia wants to be recognised as having a ""national reality"". But in truth, nobody wants to be left behind. 
That will affect most notably the Basques, who currently enjoy even more powers than the Catalans. It is hard to predict the effects of a Catalan yes on the slow-moving peace process in the Basque country. Basque nationalists, including erstwhile ETA terrorists, could take the Catalan route of negotiations with Madrid. In the past, however, the dynamic of Spanish regionalism has required that, whatever others have, Basques and Catalans should have more. So Basque nationalists, seeing Andalusians hard on their heels, may demand a lot more. But a right to self-determination has already been ruled out by Mr Zapatero. And if the People's Party is angry about the Catalan charter, it is even more hostile to negotiations with ETA. 
This will limit Mr Zapatero's room for manoeuvre with the Basques. Unlike peacemakers in Northern Ireland in the 1990s, he will not have bipartisan support from his main opposition party. That may, however, produce an unintended pay-off, in the form of a political ""good cop, bad cop"" scenario. ETA's choice may be to deal now with the good cop Zapatero--or to suffer, at some point in the future, from the intransigence of a bad cop People's Party.
A Catalan ""yes"" will remind Basques of the work they still have to do, but it should at least allow Catalans to relax. The new charter ought to last for a couple of decades, at least. ""We won't be able to go back to it during our political lifetime,"" says Mr Duran i Lleida.",230,Spain,"After the Catalans, Basques and Andalusians want autonomy too

That may, however, produce an unintended pay-off, in the form of a political ""good cop, bad cop"" scenario. ETA's choice may be to deal now with the good cop Zapatero--or to suffer, at some point in the future, from the intransigence of a bad cop People's Party.
A Catalan ""yes"" will remind Basques of the work they still have to do, but it should at least allow Catalans to relax. The new charter ought to last for a couple of decades, at least. ""We won't be able to go back to it during our political lifetime,"" says Mr Duran i Lleida.",True

A quarter-century after he first wrote it, a British military historian reworks his epic study of the Spanish civil war--and challenges many of its enduring myths
ANTONY BEEVOR, a military historian and former soldier, has made a speciality over the past decade of sifting through recently opened Russian archives in search of new material about old events. This search has yielded considerable treasures, allowing him to produce a fresh account, from the inside, of the siege of Stalingrad and a narrative of the final battle for Berlin. Both became bestsellers, translated into more than 20 languages and with 2m copies in print. 
Mr Beevor's latest trawl through these same archives, far from resulting in a new book, has led him instead to rewrite an earlier work, his 1982 account of the Spanish civil war. Mr Beevor seeks to dispel many of the myths that arose from the conflict, in particular the mystique surrounding the republican cause. 
If the history of wars tends to be written by the victors, Spain's civil war is the great exception. Few believed General Francisco Franco's version of the divinely backed ""crusade"" against communists, freemasons, separatists, atheists and other assorted enemies. As a result, an air of heady romance surrounds those who lost. The heroic figures of the war are the poet-volunteers of the International Brigades, the anarchist militia fighters of the republic and the woman known as la Pasionaria, Dolores Ibarruri. ""No pasaran!"" (""They shall not pass"") she famously said of Franco's right-wing rebels. She was wrong. The 1936 rightist uprising ended in absolute victory in 1939. Spain lived under dictatorship for nearly four more decades.
Spain's short-lived republic, argues Mr Beevor, was badly destabilised by those on the left who later claimed to be its protectors. An attempted 1934 revolution, led by Asturian miners against a conservative republican government, inflicted a terrible blow. The left-wing Popular Front that won the elections then failed to control its extreme supporters. Had the left not won at the polls, Mr Beevor suspects, it would have risen up against the right. However well-informed, that is only speculation.
Twentieth-century right-wing dictators routinely claimed to be saving their countries from communist ""evil"". Franco was no exception. Was he right, though? Some Spaniards think he was, as recent sales of revisionist polemics show. Mr Beevor does not go that far. The rightist uprising was, after all, against an elected government. The counter-factual question of what might have happened may be fascinating--but it remains just that, a question. 
The ultimate success of the generals' rebellion came down to many things. Top of Mr Beevor's list is republican incompetence. Advance warnings were ignored. Then, when it happened, the republic was crippled by hesitation. Indecision, ill-discipline and poor officers threw away what early on was a winning position.
Spain was a curtain-raiser for the second world war--pitting the great totalitarian blocks against one another. Missing from the equation, however, were the democratic powers of Europe and America. Mr Beevor nails the hypocrisy of their non-intervention. Britain's ambassador in Spain, Sir Henry Chilton, was ""a blatant admirer"" of the nationalists. Anthony Eden, the foreign secretary, supposedly told his French counterpart that he preferred a quick rebel victory. The behaviour of the Royal Navy was ""astonishing for a non-interventionist power"". Quiet conversations by pro-nationalist Spanish aristocrats in White's, a London gentlemen's club, were ""infinitely more influential on government policy than mass rallies ordemonstrations"". So much, then, for theefforts of the intellectuals--from W.H.Auden to George Orwell--who made the republic their cause celebre.
Texaco, meanwhile, fuelled Franco's army. ""Without American petroleum and American trucks and American credit we could never have won the civil war,"" one official said later. Hitler, Mussolini andStalin ignored non-intervention. Spainbecame their military sandpit. They sent troops, tanks, aircraft, advisers and pilots. 
Mr Beevor lists the military milestones that they helped Franco to attain. The first major troop airlift in history, for example, brought his Army of Africa to mainland Spain. The intense aerial bombardment of Madrid was the first of a major capital, the precursor to the London Blitz. The destruction of the Basque town of Guernica, which inspired Picasso's famous painting, fitted Germany's treatment of Spain as a test laboratory for military hardware. Heinkel bombers were the first to attack the town. Careful follow-up work was done elsewhere to assess the bombingaccuracy of the new German aircraft,especially the Junkers 87 or ""Stuka"". 
Hitler's insistence that German arms go to Franco, rather than rival generals, helped the future caudillo win absolute control of the nationalist side. The republic walked willingly into Stalin's embrace. Communists, and their Soviet advisers, brought discipline and organisation to the army. Mr Beevor shows how they also brought Trotskyist paranoia, witch hunts, strategic errors and a tendency to blamedisasters on imagined enemies within. The republic's final chance of survival lay in the hope that the democracies would wake up to Hitler. Neville Chamberlain chose appeasement. Mr Beevor reckons Franco's ensuing ""white terror"" claimed 200,000 lives. The ""red terror"" had already killed 38,000. The real loser of the battle for Spain was Spain itself.
The current debate focuses on how the republic and, indeed, the civil war should be remembered.

IT COULD turn out to be a key moment in recent Spanish history. The government is to start talks with the Basque separatist group, ETA, this summer. A definitive end to four decades of terrorist violence may be on the horizon.
The talks come three months after ETA declared a ceasefire. Basques, who overwhelmingly reject ETA's terrorist methods, are mostly delighted. Polls show that other Spaniards, as a whole, are pleased too. Many now see ETA as an unwanted relic from the days when Spain was under the dictatorship of Franco. In the past 40 years, ETA has killed more than 800 people. But it had not killed anyone for almost three years before its ceasefire was declared.
That was partly because al-Qaeda's March 2004 train bombings in Madrid made any terrorist outrage seem even less acceptable. But it was also because Spain has come as close as is possible to defeating a terrorist group. Indeed, the talks may be a way of formalising that defeat, without forcing ETA to admit its own failure.
Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero, the Socialist prime minister, had pledged to announce the talks in the Madrid parliament. He stuck to that, but only just. Instead of the debating chamber, he chose a press conference. That meant that the boos of Spain's conservative opposition, the People's Party (PP), could not spoil the moment. ""The process is going to be long, hard and difficult,"" Mr Zapatero declared, adding that ""peace is a task for everybody.""
The PP does not see it that way. ""You can't negotiate with someone whose negotiating weapon is as powerful and hard to argue with as a pistol,"" said their leader, Mariano Rajoy. Mr Zapatero's PP predecessor, Jose Maria Aznar, accused him of bowing to terrorism. ""Who is winning this game? Is it the victims? No, it is the killers,"" he said. The peace process, if this is it, looks set to pass the PP by.
The PP's position is that principle must be placed before pragmatism when terrorism is involved. But this claim to the moral high ground is spoiled by the fact that when it was in government, it too talked to ETA during a previous ceasefire. The PP's refusal to back Mr Zapatero now is an unwelcome obstacle. One key to the Northern Ireland peace process was the support of the opposition in Britain's parliament. Mr Zapatero must now walk alone.
The signs from those close to ETA are encouraging, though there is surely much scope for messing up. The hope is that ETA's banned political wing, Batasuna, will formally condemn violence as a step to being allowed to stand for election again. ""We don't want them outside the democratic system, but rather inside,"" says Patxi Lopez, the Basque Socialist leader.
If peace comes, Mr Zapatero will reap political rewards. Yet it was PP governments from 1996 to 2004 that oversaw ETA's near-defeat. The opposition would presumably like to get back into power. It may need to take peace lessons first.

SELDOM can a European prime minister have had a less auspicious start. It was only days after al-Qaeda's Madrid train bombings on March 11th 2004 that the Socialists unexpectedly won an election in Spain, propelling their leader, Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero, into the top job. Mr Zapatero was inexperienced, ill-prepared and unprepossessing; he was nicknamed ""Bambi"", as he often looked like a startled fawn caught in the headlights. His very first action was to pull Spanish troops out of Iraq, infuriating the Americans and provoking charges of appeasing terrorism.
How different it all looks today. No other European leader is as popular or as entrenched at home as Mr Zapatero. It is true that, under his predecessors, the European Union has for many years seen post-Franco Spain, like Ireland, as one of its great success stories: modern, democratic and increasingly prosperous. The Spaniards are masters at extracting money from Brussels. And they have carefully and gradually freed up an economy that was (and to an extent still is) unduly mired in red tape.
Mr Zapatero has added three achievements to this list. The first, and perhaps most important, was not to muck it all up. His experienced finance minister, Pedro Solbes, has kept the public accounts in order. The government has not succumbed to leftists' usual fondness for too much new regulation or interference in the labour market--indeed, unemployment, albeit still over 8%, is at its lowest for 25 years. Within the EU, Spain under Mr Zapatero has usually, if not always, been on the side of the liberalisers and in favour of the Lisbon Agenda to promote competitiveness--more so than the three other big euro members, France, Germany and Italy.
The prime minister's second achievement has been to tackle Spain's restive regions. His People's Party predecessor, Jose Maria Aznar, was positively Castilian in his determination to maintain Madrid's grip and refuse to negotiate. Yet Mr Zapatero quickly began to discuss a new deal with Catalonia. He also reached out to the Basques, even offering to talk to ETA if the terrorist group declared a permanent ceasefire. The People's Party pilloried him for giving in to the gun and, more generally, risking the break-up of Spain. Yet Mr Zapatero has now delivered a new statute for Catalonia that uses the word ""nation"" but stops short of self-determination, let alone independence. After securing his permanent ceasefire, he is also going to talk to ETA. The prospect of a settlement in the Basque country looks the best in a generation.
In all this, Mr Zapatero has faced relentless opposition from the People's Party, as he has in his third area of achievement: the modernisation of Spanish society. Before he arrived, the Catholic Church still held great sway in such matters as attitudes to sex or religious instruction in schools; and open debate about the Spanish civil war remained taboo. Mr Zapatero's government has passed some of the most liberal laws in Europe, including legalising gay marriage. He has also opened up debate about the civil war, in which his own grandfather was shot dead by nationalists. If it can come to terms with its past, Spain will surely be better able to face its future.
The economy, stupid
There are some causes for concern. As British experience in Northern Ireland suggests, talks with ETA may be long, painful and perhaps unsuccessful. Other regions may now insist on more autonomy. The church's hostility could damage the Socialists. Most worrying of all, Spain's prosperity is precarious: the current-account deficit is gaping, the economy is far too dependent on a boom in property and construction, inflation is rising and, locked inside the euro, Spanish industry is fast losing its competitiveness (see page 33).
The economy clearly needs more deregulation, not the fostering of national champions that Mr Zapatero has espoused. Yet overall he has proved a better prime minister than critics expected. The opposition People's Party is in disarray, so his party is well placed to win re-election in 2008. Other leaders, not least George Bush, with whom Mr Zapatero's relations remain frosty, should take note: this prime minister, presiding over the world's ninth-biggest economy, will be around for a while.

SUMMER is not what it was in Madrid. Only a few years ago the Spanish capital ground to a halt every August, as offices, shops and bars closed for the entire month. This year, most of the city is planning to remain open. It is yet another sign that one of Europe's best-performing economies, with a decade of continuous growth under its belt, has ditched its old ""siesta-and-fiesta"" reputation.
One man who will be leaving Madrid is Spain's Socialist prime minister, Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero. The political year is over and, as he hits the beaches in the Canary island of Lanzarote, he may reflect on several triumphs. The economy is powering on--GDP is expected to grow by almost 3.5% this year. The ticklish Catalan question appears to have been answered, with a bit of fudging, through a new autonomy statute. The Basque terrorist group, ETA, is sticking to its permanent ceasefire declared in the spring. A slew of socially liberal legislation, from gay marriage to fast-track divorce, has gone through parliament. To crown it all, Mr Zapatero's Socialist Party (PSOE) has a comfortable, if not huge, lead in the opinion polls.
In short, halfway through his first term in office, Mr Zapatero looks to be a man in control--and one who is increasingly likely to be re-elected in 2008. The leader once jokingly known as ""Bambi"" may thus be around for a long time to come. Yet he cannot afford to rest on his laurels. His political future may seem promising, but Spain's long-running economic boom is not quite so healthy.
Inflation is close to 4%, almost 1.5 points above the average for the euro area. Spain boasts one of the world's biggest current-account deficits, heading for over 9% of GDP. Cheap credit, a construction boom and domestic consumption, not investment, have been the main motors of growth. House prices, says a recent Goldman Sachs report, may be overvalued by as much as 25-35%. With euro interest rates rising, the housing bubble could well burst, pulling the rug out from under a construction sector that accounts for 16% of GDP and 12% of employment.
""If we weren't in the euro zone, our inflation and external deficit would already have produced recession and devaluation,"" says Miguel Arias Canete, economics spokesman for the opposition People's Party (PP). Economists are divided. Several are just as gloomy as Mr Arias Canete. ""We are not on a good path,"" says Rafael Pampillon, of Madrid's Instituto de Empresa business school. ""It has to come to an end, because we cannot keep building homes at this rate."" When the building stops, he says, the cycle by which construction fuels consumption, and vice versa, could be inverted: ""the virtuous cycle becomes a vicious one.""
The trouble with warnings about an overheated Spanish economy is that they are starting to sound stale. Predictions of collapse in the housing market are at least three years old. Some economists now think that prices will simply flatten out, as they have elsewhere. ""A soft landing similar to that experienced in the United Kingdom and in the United States seems the most probable scenario,"" argues Jose Carlos Diez, chief economist at Intermoney, a stockbroker. Mortgage-holders have plenty of wiggle-room, he says, to extend payment periods. Spain's banks are robust enough to handle a rise in defaulters. Inflation may eat away at competitiveness, but immigrants have kept wages down, boosted social-security receipts and provided new, eager consumers. Another 650,000 immigrants arrived last year.
All the same, Mr Zapatero has little room for manoeuvre. He cannot devalue a currency, the euro, that is shared with 11 other countries. He cannot look to a sharp rise in interest rates to curb inflation, because rates are set by the European Central Bank, which must take into account the larger, more sluggish, economies of Germany and France. A tighter rein on public spending is another possible response, but the budget is already in surplus. ""We are very aware of the importance of budget policy,"" says David Vegara Figueras, deputy finance minister. ""It is important that we do not throw on more gasoline.""
Does Spain have much time? Mr Pampillon predicts that the housing bubble, if it bursts, will do so in 2008. ""We expect the slowdown to be quite mild,"" says Javier Perez de Azpillaga, at Goldman Sachs, who says that GDP growth will remain over 2.5% in 2007. ""That is not a disaster. In fact it is very good compared with the rest of euroland."" Spaniards may be fretting about high house prices but, apart from that, they show little concern about their consumption- and credit-driven economy.
In politics, meanwhile, the PP has made little effort to return to the centre ground from where it was able to govern Spain for eight years until 2004. Vitriolic opposition to such relatively popular moves as gay marriage or peace talks with ETA plays well to a hard-core conservative audience, but not to the centre. Mr Zapatero has been quick to spot the gap. Indeed, his latest move is a bold attempt to dress the PSOE in the clothes of liberalism.
""In its social and political side, the values of liberalism are better represented by the PSOE than the PP,"" Mr Zapatero's chief economic adviser, Miguel Sebastian, declared in a recent speech. ""In the economy the PSOE also better represents the principles of stimulating the private sector, less intervention and a reasonable-sized public sector.""
This is clever, if not entirely convincing. The PSOE can certainly claim to be social liberals. They have also tended to be more liberal economically than, say, their French counterparts. The government even has plans, not yet set in concrete, to cut corporate tax by five points, to 30%, over the next few years. The finance minister, Pedro Solbes, has a well-earned reputation for balancing his budget.
But the PSOE is no free-market party. The government's attempts to obstruct a takeover by Germany's E.ON of a Spanish electricity giant, Endesa, regardless of EU rules, are proof of that.

Perhaps, as he rests this August, Mr Zapatero might conclude that further liberalisation could kill two birds with one stone--not only warding off an economic slowdown, but also ensuring that he gets a second term.",230,Spain,"Spain's much-maligned prime minister has reason for quiet satisfaction
SUMMER is not what it was in Madrid. Only a few years ago the Spanish capital ground to a halt every August, as offices, shops and bars closed for the entire month. This year, most of the city is planning to remain open. It is yet another sign that one of Europe's best-performing economies, with a decade of continuous growth under its belt, has ditched its old ""siesta-and-fiesta"" reputation.
One man who will be leaving Madrid is Spain's Socialist prime minister, Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero. The political year is over and, as he hits the beaches in the Canary island of Lanzarote, he may reflect on several triumphs. The economy is powering on--GDP is expected to grow by almost 3.5% this year. The ticklish Catalan question appears to have been answered, with a bit of fudging, through a new autonomy statute. The Basque terrorist group, ETA, is sticking to its permanent ceasefire declared in the spring. A slew of socially liberal legislation, from gay marriage to fast-track divorce, has gone through parliament. To crown it all, Mr Zapatero's Socialist Party (PSOE) has a comfortable, if not huge, lead in the opinion polls.
In short, halfway through his first term in office, Mr Zapatero looks to be a man in control--and one who is increasingly likely to be re-elected in 2008. The leader once jokingly known as ""Bambi"" may thus be around for a long time to come. Yet he cannot afford to rest on his laurels. His political future may seem promising, but Spain's long-running economic boom is not quite so healthy.
Inflation is close to 4%, almost 1.5 points above the average for the euro area. Spain boasts one of the world's biggest current-account deficits, heading for over 9% of GDP. Cheap credit, a construction boom and domestic consumption, not investment, have been the main motors of growth. House prices, says a recent Goldman Sachs report, may be overvalued by as much as 25-35%. With euro interest rates rising, the housing bubble could well burst, pulling the rug out from under a construction sector that accounts for 16% of GDP and 12% of employment.
""If we weren't in the euro zone, our inflation and external deficit would already have produced recession and devaluation,"" says Miguel Arias Canete, economics spokesman for the opposition People's Party (PP). Economists are divided. Several are just as gloomy as Mr Arias Canete. ""We are not on a good path,"" says Rafael Pampillon, of Madrid's Instituto de Empresa business school. ""It has to come to an end, because we cannot keep building homes at this rate."" When the building stops, he says, the cycle by which construction fuels consumption, and vice versa, could be inverted: ""the virtuous cycle becomes a vicious one.""
The trouble with warnings about an overheated Spanish economy is that they are starting to sound stale. Predictions of collapse in the housing market are at least three years old. Some economists now think that prices will simply flatten out, as they have elsewhere. ""A soft landing similar to that experienced in the United Kingdom and in the United States seems the most probable scenario,"" argues Jose Carlos Diez, chief economist at Intermoney, a stockbroker. Mortgage-holders have plenty of wiggle-room, he says, to extend payment periods. Spain's banks are robust enough to handle a rise in defaulters. Inflation may eat away at competitiveness, but immigrants have kept wages down, boosted social-security receipts and provided new, eager consumers. Another 650,000 immigrants arrived last year.
All the same, Mr Zapatero has little room for manoeuvre. He cannot devalue a currency, the euro, that is shared with 11 other countries. He cannot look to a sharp rise in interest rates to curb inflation, because rates are set by the European Central Bank, which must take into account the larger, more sluggish, economies of Germany and France. A tighter rein on public spending is another possible response, but the budget is already in surplus. ""We are very aware of the importance of budget policy,"" says David Vegara Figueras, deputy finance minister. ""It is important that we do not throw on more gasoline.""
Does Spain have much time? Mr Pampillon predicts that the housing bubble, if it bursts, will do so in 2008. ""We expect the slowdown to be quite mild,"" says Javier Perez de Azpillaga, at Goldman Sachs, who says that GDP growth will remain over 2.5% in 2007. ""That is not a disaster. In fact it is very good compared with the rest of euroland."" Spaniards may be fretting about high house prices but, apart from that, they show little concern about their consumption- and credit-driven economy.
In politics, meanwhile, the PP has made little effort to return to the centre ground from where it was able to govern Spain for eight years until 2004. Vitriolic opposition to such relatively popular moves as gay marriage or peace talks with ETA plays well to a hard-core conservative audience, but not to the centre. Mr Zapatero has been quick to spot the gap. Indeed, his latest move is a bold attempt to dress the PSOE in the clothes of liberalism.
""In its social and political side, the values of liberalism are better represented by the PSOE than the PP,"" Mr Zapatero's chief economic adviser, Miguel Sebastian, declared in a recent speech. ""In the economy the PSOE also better represents the principles of stimulating the private sector, less intervention and a reasonable-sized public sector.""
This is clever, if not entirely convincing. The PSOE can certainly claim to be social liberals. They have also tended to be more liberal economically than, say, their French counterparts. The government even has plans, not yet set in concrete, to cut corporate tax by five points, to 30%, over the next few years. The finance minister, Pedro Solbes, has a well-earned reputation for balancing his budget.
But the PSOE is no free-market party. The government's attempts to obstruct a takeover by Germany's E.ON of a Spanish electricity giant, Endesa, regardless of EU rules, are proof of that. A mild reform of employment law this year made firing workers cheaper, but it still costs a lot more than in other countries.
Yet Mr Sebastian's analysis is intriguing. Spain introduced the word ""liberal"" to world politics early in the 19th century. But it has no liberal party of its own.

THE ugly little mid-summer war that has just ended in Lebanon spilled over into the parliaments, streets, television studios and dinner parties of Europe. By and large, Israel got the worst of it. 
The Council of Europe said that Israel's response to Hizbullah's cross-border attacks was ""disproportionate"" and accused Israel of ""indiscriminate attacks on civilian targets"". Romano Prodi, Italy's prime minister, called Israel's reaction ""excessive"". In Norway, Jostein Gaarder, the author of ""Sophie's World"", accused Israel of ethnic cleansing and murdering children, and said that the Jewish state had forfeited its right to exist. In many capitals, anti-war protesters marched under Hizbullah flags. When Britain's Tony Blair tried to explain things from Israel's point of view--and failed to call for an immediate ceasefire--his political stock took another tumble. 
Mr Gaarder was prodded into a half-hearted apology. But the truth is that, far from being extreme, these criticisms of Israel convey the mood of millions of Europeans, rooted in what polls suggest is a hardening attitude. A YouGov poll in Britain, taken in the first two weeks of the conflict, found 63% of respondents saying that the Israeli response to Hizbullah's attack was ""disproportionate""; a similar German poll had 75% saying so. 
Such reactions reflect a wider European view of Israel that contrasts sharply with America's. In a Pew Global Attitudes survey earlier this year, far more Europeans sympathised with the Palestinians than with Israel (see chart). These findings come on top of a European Union poll in 2003 that had 59% of Europeans considering Israel as a greater menace to world peace than Iran, North Korea and Pakistan. 
Why has Europe become so reflexively anti-Israel, just when America has become so reflexively pro-Israel? Europe has no equivalent of America's powerful AIPAC Israeli lobby, and it also has a disgruntled (and growing) Muslim population. But neither is enough to explain all the difference in attitude. Indeed, many Muslims in Europe now feel beleaguered and can only dream of wielding AIPAC's clout.
Some Americans blame rising anti-Semitism in Europe, which they also attribute in part to its growing Muslim population. But there is a difference between being anti-Semitic and being anti-Israel. And in any case, it is not obvious that anti-Semitism is a big factor. In central Europe, for example, there seems to be both greater anti-Semitism and more support for Israel. And some polls suggest that more Americans think Jews have ""too much influence"" in their country than do Europeans.
It is also often the right in Europe, linked with anti-Semitism in the past, that is most supportive of Israel today. Britain's Conservative Party, for instance, not always known for its admiration of Jews or Israel, is now the most pro-Israel party. In Italy, which invented fascism, Silvio Berlusconi's Forza Italia and Gianfranco Fini's formerly neo-fascist National Alliance, are more pro-Israel than the government. In Spain, the centre-right opposition was highly critical of Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero, the Socialist prime minister, when he donned an Arab headscarf to show solidarity during the Lebanon war.
Countries that were most culpable in the Holocaust tend to be stauncher supporters of Israel--especially Germany. What was then West Germany became the main financial backer of the new Jewish state six decades ago, with a first payment of $865m in 1952. Aid continued throughout the 1960s, long before America became Israel's main source of outside support. This week's decision to commit German troops to the peacekeeping force in Lebanon also reflects past guilt.
If the right (and the Germans) are doing penance, the left, which now controls many of Europe's chanceries, and certainly much of its media, feels a sense of betrayal--which is why many now attack Israel with all the zeal of the convert. Until the 1960s European socialists championed the cause of the Jews and Israel. Mid-century socialists saw anti-Semitism and fascism as products of the right, so they became instinctively pro-Israel. In the 1950s it was left-wing French governments that provided Israel with nuclear power and a modern air force.
This changed with the six-day war in 1967, when Israel launched a pre-emptive strike to defeat the Jordanian, Egyptian and Syrian forces that seemed about to invade. It was a stunning victory, but it led to the occupation of the West Bank, Gaza and Sinai. To European socialists, who had rallied to the underdog Israel in 1967, the Palestinians were now the oppressed and displaced. Israel came to be seen as a neo-colonial regional superpower, not the plucky survivor of the Holocaust keeping powerful neighbours at bay. 
In the decades after 1967 Israeli politics also changed. The Labour Party, which had largely ruled Israel since 1948, began to lose ground to right-wing parties, notably Likud. European left-wingers, who had idealised Golda Meir's Israel as a pioneering socialist collective of happy kibbutzniks, were shocked by what they saw as the militarisation and racism of Menachem Begin's Israel--and they began a romance with the Palestinians instead.
This change can be chronicled over nearly a century in such liberal papers as Britain's Guardian. Chaim Weizmann, the first president of Israel, played a vital role in fostering the Guardian's early advocacy of Zionism and Israel, but the paper is now one of Israel's harshest critics. The BBC, a bastion of the soft left establishment, has also been criticised for its bias against Israel, not least during the latest war. 
Attitudes to America have also clouded European views, especially on the left. As Israel has drawn closer to America in the past few decades, the left's antipathy towards the behemoth of capitalism has spilled into dislike of Israel. Public opinion in Turkey, the one Muslim country that was once pro-Israel, has turned against it in parallel with its turn against America, especially over the war in Iraq.
Emanuele Ottolenghi, an expert on Israel and Europe at Oxford University, argues that ""Europeans see Israel as the embodiment of the demons of their own past."" The European Union is supposed to have traded in war, nationalism and conflict for love, peace and federalism. But Israel now reminds Europeans of darker forces and darker days.
Could attitudes change? It seems unlikely, not least because Israel is now so stridently critical of the Europeans, especially of their media. In this area, at least, the transatlantic gap is widening.",230,Spain,"Why Europe, unlike America, finds it so hard to love Israel

THE takeover of Endesa, Spain's biggest electricity firm, by E.ON, a German utility, is well on its way, declared Angela Merkel, the German chancellor, at a press conference in Berlin last week. This might be just wishful thinking. But it is more likely to mean that Ms Merkel has some inkling that the Spanish government is preparing to back down over its obstinate obstruction of the German bid.
In spite of increasing pressure from the European Union's competition division, Jose Luis Zapatero's government has yet to give any public indication of its willingness to compromise. On August 25th EU regulators warned the Spanish government that the restrictions it has imposed on E.ON's bid for Endesa are illegal. The Spaniards reacted with defiance. ""The government will continue to defend its position, because we believe we are right,"" said Maria Teresa Fernandez de la Vega, Mr Zapatero's deputy.
In preparation for the full liberalisation of Europe's energy markets next July, the government thinks Spain needs a national energy champion that can rival the gigawatts of Electricite de France and Germany's RWE. So it is backing Gas Natural, a Spanish gas company based in Barcelona, the Catalan capital, which launched a hostile bid for Endesa last September. This also suits Mr Zapatero: the Catalan party is a pivotal member of his governing coalition and Jose Montilla, the industry minister who oversees the energy business, is Catalan. Mr Montilla is about to leave his post to run for regional elections in Catalonia and Mr Zapatero announced on August 29th that he would be replaced by Joan Clos, another Catalan, who is mayor of Barcelona.
Since E.ON stepped in at the end of February with a bigger and better offer, the government has manoeuvred to frustrate it. E.ON is offering euro29.1 billion ($34.7 billion) for Endesa--the biggest takeover bid in the history of the utilities industry--compared with Gas Natural's euro22.5 billion cash-and-stock offer. After its own antitrust authority and the EU approved E.ON's proposal in April, the government's obstructionism intensified. Eager to thwart the deal, the government has invested special powers in CNE, which is Spain's energy regulator and is controlled by a board that is close to the government.
At the end of July the CNE imposed 19 conditions on E.ON's bid for Endesa, such as a commitment to invest in gas-transmission networks and an obligation to keep Endesa properly capitalised. But three of the CNE's demands are not so reasonable. First, E.ON would have to sell the only nuclear-power plant wholly owned by Endesa. Next, it would also have to sell all of Endesa's coal-powered plants, because Spanish coal is subsidised and the government is worried that the Germans would use cheaper imports. Third, Endesa's operations on the Balearic and Canary Islands, and in northern Africa, must be divested. This would, in effect, amount to breaking up Endesa.
Neither E.ON nor Endesa wants that. Both companies appealed against the conditions at the industry ministry. But since the industry minister is likely to side with the CNE, they plan to take their case to a commercial court or the Supreme Court--unless the government relents under pressure from the EU. The deadline for the government's reply to last week's warning was originally September 4th, but has now been extended to September 13th, after Madrid asked for a postponement. If its reply is not satisfactory, the EU will require the Spanish government to withdraw its conditions, and if the government refuses to do so, the EU will take the case to the European Court of Justice in Luxembourg, says Jonathan Todd, a spokesman for the competition commissioner.
Insiders think the government will try to avoid long-running and costly litigation. But it will probably wait until after the regional elections in Catalonia on November 1st before watering down or eliminating any of its 19 conditions. Mr Zapatero has plenty on his plate, such as tackling immigration and dealing with ETA, the Basque terrorist group. He does not want to poison relations with his European counterparts. Perhaps at their recent get-together in Germany he gave Ms Merkel a hint of a forthcoming climbdown. After all, a physicist by training, she tends to stick to the facts.

Some 60% put part of the blame on their government. 
More than half a million foreigners have arrived for each of the past three years. Some 700,000 illegal immigrants were granted amnesty last year. So the issue is hardly new. But the questions it prompts are becoming tougher. Can Spain absorb more people? Can it afford not to?

Immigrants now make up 8.7% of the population--a fourfold increase in just six years. Those turning up so telegenically in the Canary Islands are, at 21,000 over a year, just a detail. Most step off flights from Latin American countries and walk straight into jobs on building sites or as household helpers. 
Spain has benefited in many ways. Social-security receipts have increased, postponing a pensions crisis. Migrants have stoked demand, helping annual GDP growth reach 3.7%. They have even turned around the country's declining birth rate. And they have kept labour costs down.
Josep Oliver, from Barcelona's Autonoma university, reckons Spain will need 4m extra workers by 2020. With their families in tow, that would put the immigrant population at 10m, or almost a fifth of what may then be the total. His study suggests Spain may need even more, with up to 9.8m if growth continues apace. Even if growth is low, 2.3m will be needed.
That is because native Spaniards' birth rate is so low. An average senora will bear just 1.35 children in her lifetime. ""Collectively we decided not to have children and, without knowing it, we decided to have immigrants,"" says Mr Oliver.

That is because native Spaniards' birth rate is so low. An average senora will bear just 1.35 children in her lifetime. ""Collectively we decided not to have children and, without knowing it, we decided to have immigrants,"" says Mr Oliver. To show he has a grip on the issue, the prime minister, Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero, must tell voters to expect more newcomers, not fewer. That will take courage.",True

BOTH have centre-left coalition governments. Both are committed to European integration. Both are firm supporters of the draft European Union constitution. Both have low fertility, high immigration and declining competitiveness. And both are Latin, Mediterranean and used to taking siestas.
But now Spain and Italy are converging in a new way. For much of the past decade Spain's economy has been growing at around twice the EU average. At this rate, officials beam, Spain will surpass Italy in terms of GDP per head by 2009. If you account for the black economy (Italy does, Spain does not), Spaniards might be richer already. Yes, such claims should be treated with scepticism: in the mid-1980s, Italy boasted loudly and prematurely of overtaking Britain. But Spain's economy is already as big as Canada's (which is, like Italy, a G8 member). And if you add in demographic trends--an immigration boom is more than offsetting a shrinking native population--then the prime minister, Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero, is surely right to assert that Spain will soon join Britain, France, Germany and Italy in the club of Europe's big five countries.
Spain's new prosperity is the product of long preparation. Compared with other big European countries, Spain has a less generous welfare state. Unlike Italy, it has marginalised its Communist party, which has no base in the trade unions. Trade unions are moderate: they have accepted flexible short-term labour contracts, which French unions resist fiercely. But when compared with Italy, two features stand out. One is the Spanish preference for single-coloured, enduring governments, despite a proportional voting system that favours regional parties. The second is a deep-seated respect for fiscal orthodoxy. Budget discipline was built into the post-Franco settlement of 1976. And the Socialist Party abandoned Marxism and adopted a ""third way"" as long ago as 1980--years before Tony Blair.
The two features are closely related. Spain tends to have longer-lived, solid governments; Italy has shaky coalitions. Between them Italy's two biggest centre-left parties took some 30% of the vote in April's election and needed nine other parties to secure a majority. Spain's Socialists got over 40% of the vote and fell just a dozen votes short of a majority on their own. The Socialists can play minor parties, mostly regional ones which (a) share the state religion of good housekeeping and (b) want more regional power, off against each other. If it needs to, the ruling party can drum up regional support by offering devolution that does not compromise fiscal austerity. 
The contrast is especially sharp right at this moment. Both Spain and Italy are in the process of pushing their annual budgets through parliament. But in Spain, says Francisco Fernandez Marugan, the Socialist deputy whose job it is to shepherd the budget through the lower house, the coalition partners will add no more than euro500m ($625m) to a budget of around euro300 billion. In Italy the government agreed a spending plan unanimously at cabinet level. But when it went to parliament, there were 7,000 amendments, of which no fewer than 3,000 came from the ruling coalition. In Italy party and budget discipline alike seem unknown. In Spain they reinforce each other.
Of course, not everything is rosy in the garden of Spain. The fiscal situation is worse than it looks because two-thirds of public debt, attributable to regional governments, is not accounted for. Compared with Italy, Spain has few internationally competitive small firms. It is overly dependent on construction and is ""enjoying"" a housing boom. As a result, says Jose Luis Feito, at the employers' federation, the economy is highly vulnerable to higher interest rates, which are likely to be on their way. 
Like Italy, Spain is stuck with high-cost, low-productivity businesses that are vulnerable to Chinese competition; poor schools; and low spending on research and development. Moreover, the political deal by which regional parties support economic stability may be limited. Spain has the most devolved political system in Europe outside Belgium; at some point the Madrid government, especially the finance ministry, will conclude that it has gone far enough (and is costing enough).
From disaster to top table
Overall, however, economic success has produced a change in the public temperament of a country comparable only with that of Germany after the second world war, says Pedro Schwartz, a professor at the San Pablo CEU University in Madrid. For most of the 20th century, after defeat in the Spanish-American war of 1898 (known in Spain as ""the disaster""), everybody's favourite topic was ""the problem of Spain"". Italy was the model of a modernising Mediterranean state. ""Spain is different"", as a tourist slogan of the 1960s used to put it. 
Now Spain has self-confidence on steroids. Spanish companies are on acquisition sprees, first in Latin America, now in Europe. Two of Europe's top ten business schools are in Spain; Zara, one of the world's fastest-growing retailers, is based in Galicia. Spaniards no longer feel different; they want to be European. They showed it by being the first to vote for, and overwhelmingly approve, the EU constitution.
This new self-confidence will have consequences both for Spain and for its neighbours. For itself, because confidence makes it easier to sustain economic growth and stability: people sense that it works. For the neighbours, because Spain has long been regarded as an effective but marginal EU member--effective at defending subsidies, but only a medium-ranking power, on a par with Poland or the Netherlands. Its emergence as an equal to Italy and even France will give it a seat at the top table. If there is ever a core Europe or a pioneer group, Spain will be in it.

Internal bickering fills the newspapers; senior figures jostle to succeed the present leader, Mariano Rajoy, if he stands down after the next election in early 2008.
National politics in Spain is a two-party affair. If the PP is to oust the Socialist prime minister, Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero, it needs voters in the centre. But it shows no sign of wooing them. Instead, it angrily opposes all government initiatives, from gay marriage to Catalan devolution, to peace talks with the Basque terrorist group, ETA. Like Britain's Conservative Party in the past, it risks seeming to be a ""nasty"" party. A recent video attacking Mr Zapatero's record on crime, which included pictures of violence from the time when the PP was in power, has not helped.
Yet at the root of the PP's troubles is its inability to shake off the trauma of its loss of power. This came three days after Muslim terrorists killed 191 people on Madrid trains. The day before the vote, angry protesters came out on the streets demanding to know who was to blame. Was it ETA, as Mr Aznar insisted, or Islamists? As the evidence leant towards the second, voters who had been ready to vote for the PP shifted. 
Prosecutors and police are now convinced that only radical Muslims were involved. Seven blew themselves up in a mass suicide three weeks later, as they were about to be arrested. But senior PP figures have openly fanned conspiracy theories that still try to establish some link between the Islamists and ETA.
The noise over the March 2004 bombings drowns out the PP's more centrist message. Strategists want hard-core voters to stay loyal; they fret that a new far-right party may emerge. The warm and witty Mr Rajoy ought to be the perfect antidote to any nasty image. But he has failed to stamp his personality on the party. ""He is too polite, too much of a gentleman,"" complains an observer. Mr Aznar's shadow lingers on as well.
Polls put the Socialists ahead, though their lead varies (some say it is only 1.4 points). The head of Madrid's regional government, Esperanza Aguirre, and Madrid's mayor, Alberto Ruiz-Gallardon, may increase their majorities in regional elections next year. But they are the PP's bickerers-in-chief. As Mr Rajoy said of a new book in which Ms Aguirre lays into Mr Ruiz-Gallardon: ""What a troop!"" Where, one might ask, is the general?

THE memorial notices in Spanish newspapers in recent weeks constitute a warning that some things in the past, at least, have not been forgotten. Just over 70 years after the Spanish civil war broke out in July 1936, the ghosts of that ghastly conflict are back. 
""Tortured and murdered by the Marxist hordes,"" reads one notice, published recently in El Mundo, a right-wing newspaper. Others, usually in more left-wing newspapers, speak of the mass killings that were carried out by followers of the rebel general who later became Spain's dictator, Francisco Franco.
These sudden, bitter reminders of blood that was shed long ago are more than a sign that 2006 was an anniversary year. The Socialist prime minister, Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero, has decided that public recognition should be given not only to victims of the civil war but also to those of the 36-year dictatorship that followed, ending with Franco's death in 1975. 
A draft law before the Spanish parliament proposes to name victims but not those who harmed them. The law would create a parliament-appointed committee of experts charged with the task of identifying victims wronged by either side in the conflict. The list could easily stretch into the tens of thousands. It ranges from those killed by death squads operating on both sides to political prisoners, forced labourers, children who were forced into adoption and victims of torture.
Mr Zapatero, whose own grandfather was shot by a Francoist firing squad, has walked right into a minefield. Spain's centre-right opposition accuses him of indulging in ""moth-ball"" politics, and of trying to revise history and revive old hatreds. Yet campaigners on the left, some of whom have been exhuming corpses from the hundreds of mass graves that were left by Franco's firing squads, say he is not going far enough. They want to see the sentences of Francoist tribunals formally overturned. Even some of Mr Zapatero's friends blanch at this. ""It is all a big mistake,"" says one big media supporter.
Underlying this quarrel is the whole approach that Spain took in moving from fascism to democracy. There were no truth commissions, and Francoist officials were not tried for past excesses. Unlike countries in eastern Europe, Latin America or South Africa that have made the same journey, Spain chose simply to turn the page of history. An unwritten agreement, known as the pact of forgetting, has meant that mere mention of the civil war has been kept out of everything, from politics to dinner-party conversation.
That pact has now been broken. In the past few weeks, an angry parliamentary debate has greeted Mr Zapatero's proposed law. This shows that differences over who was to blame for the three-year civil war, and over the dictatorship that followed, still run deep. Indeed, some fret that Mr Zapatero has opened a Pandora's box of troubles. But others see the debate as a healthy sign that Spain's democracy is mature enough to discuss the difficult recent past.

DIEGO ESTACIO had nodded off in his car on December 30th at Madrid's Barajas airport, where his girlfriend was meeting relatives off a flight from Ecuador, when a nearby van, packed with perhaps 500kg of explosives, blew up. The blast did more than end the 19-year-old Ecuadorean's life; it destroyed hopes of peace with the Basque separatist group, ETA, which seems to have been responsible.
Far into the middle of the week rescue workers were still searching for Estacio's remains after they had found those of a second victim, Carlos Palate. Meanwhile Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero, the prime minister, was wondering if anything could be salvaged from the wreckage of a peace process that began when ETA declared a ""permanent ceasefire"" last March.
The prospects are bleak. Mr Zapatero's repeated insistence that the peace process remained on track now looks foolish. He has used up a lot of political capital trying to solve the country's most obdurate regional terrorist problem. His reward is the first killings by ETA in more than three years. And his political position is worse than that implies. The opposition People's Party leader, Mariano Rajoy, consistently gave warning that ETA should not be trusted. The bombers have handed the PP a particularly valuable new-year gift.
ETA has had little regard for the constraints under which Mr Zapatero must operate. A PP demand that ETA be forced into unconditional surrender may be unrealistic, but adding two more to the roll-call of 800 victims killed in the past four decades can only increase its appeal. Some insist that ETA still wants to talk. But the interior minister, Alfredo Perez Rubalcaba, declared this week that the peace process was ""broken off, liquidated, finished"".
So what happens if Mr Zapatero gives it up? One possibility is that ETA will split. Some of those who have pushed for peace, including many of the several hundred ETA prisoners in Spanish jails, have lost their taste for violence. But a hard core can always be counted on to keep reaching for the bomb or the bullet. After the theft of 350 pistols and large quantities of ammunition in a raid on a French arms supplier in October, the group is not thought to be short of weapons. And there is enough grassroots support among radicals in Basque cities and hill towns to keep the hard core supplied and protected.
Does it matter? ETA is now a pale version of the efficient, and terrifying, killing machine of the 1970s and 1980s. It had failed to kill anyone at all in the 34 months before the ceasefire. It poisons the political atmosphere in the Basque country, but its political impact elsewhere has diminished over the past 15 years.
The biggest fall-out from the bomb will be felt in the Basque region itself. Basques are divided between traditional Spanish centralists and those favouring more self-rule or even independence. Moderate Basque nationalists have spent much of the past decade trying to wean ETA off violence. They have paid a heavy political price, losing opportunities to negotiate greater self-rule. Last year Mr Zapatero conceded new powers of self-government to Catalonia and Andalusia. The moderate nationalists running the Basque region may now opt to join the queue and abandon ETA, still treated by some as a prodigal son, to the police. The police have proved remarkably efficient in pursuing ETA over the past decade, partly thanks to better co-operation with their French counterparts.
ETA may have hoped that its airport bomb would not kill anyone, allowing the peace process to be kept alive. It telephoned three warnings in the hour before the explosion. But bombs are lethally unpredictable. Now the goodwill generated by the ceasefire has been blown away. If ordinary Spaniards shun peace, Mr Zapatero will not try to push them there. It took considerable political courage to travel as far as he already had. ETA is, at best, drinking in the last-chance saloon. More likely, Mr Zapatero may have already walked out of the bar.

The American secretary of state, Condoleezza Rice, toured the Middle East to promote George Bush's plan to send more troops to Iraq; she also sounded out the Palestinians and Israelis over the possibility of reviving a peace process, and proposed a three-way meeting soon. As well as Israel and the Palestinian territories, she visited Egypt, Jordan, Saudi Arabia and Kuwait. 
Israel's top general, Dan Halutz, resigned over the handling of last summer's war in Lebanon. Meanwhile, the justice ministry announced a criminal investigation into corruption allegations against the prime minister, Ehud Olmert, whose government looks increasingly fragile.
Sectarian carnage in Iraq persisted. A bomb attack on a university in Baghdad killed at least 70 people, many of them female students, while attacks elsewhere in Baghdad and in the disputed city of Kirkuk killed at least another 100. The government, meanwhile, said it had agreed to a new law to distribute oil revenue fairly among Iraq's people.
Tunisia's interior minister said that an armed group that was broken up by security forces in a recent shoot-out were radical Islamists who had infiltrated from Algeria. This raised fears that groups linked to al-Qaeda were trying to build a north African front.

""I MADE a mistake,"" is not a phrase often heard in Spanish politics. But Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero produced it in parliament this week--recognition that things are not going well for Spain's socialist prime minister. Mr Zapatero was regretting his prediction that, in relation to the armed Basque group ETA, ""we will be better off in a year's time than we are today"". Those words were spoken the day before ETA broke a nine-month ceasefire, killing two people with a bomb at Madrid's Barajas airport on December 30th. 
Already 2007 looks set to be Mr Zapatero's toughest year. Rumours that he will call an early election may be unfounded but are a sign of growing tension. At a bruising parliamentary debate to discuss the ETA bombing, the opposition People's Party (PP) leader, Mariano Rajoy, stuck to his absolute refusal to back peace talks. His party believes Mr Zapatero's desire to negotiate an end to decades of Basque separatist violence is a sign of weakness.
It is also Mr Rajoy's opportunity. If ETA plants more bombs, he will say Mr Zapatero has failed. If there are none, he will say he has caved in to terrorism. 
Even before the bombings, some of Mr Zapatero's allies were starting to question his style. The socialist-leaning El Pais newspaper accused him after the bombings of failing to tell Spaniards why he had clung to his optimism. It also reminded him that he had come to power pledging not to negotiate with ETA. ""He should have explained his motives for renouncing that,"" it said. 
All this marks a change of fortune for Mr Zapatero, whose government won election three days after radical Islamist train bombers killed 191 Madrid commuters in March 2004. Early moves, such as troop withdrawal from Iraq and legalising gay marriage, proved genuinely popular.
Now, however, he has run out of easy crowd-pleasers. New charters of self-government for some of Spain's 17 regions will appear, with Andalusia to vote in a referendum next month. They will prove less tricky than last year's Catalan charter, but are no guarantee of votes for Mr Zapatero in a 2008 general election. Nor are measures to protect the environment, modernise public services and boost research and development.

NOT since the last Moorish ruler, Boabdil, quit Granada in 1492, after 781 years of Muslim rule in al-Andalus, has anything like an Andalusian nation existed. But a new charter of autonomy gives Andalusia a ""nationality"", and even a ""millennium-long"" history. It has provoked surprisingly little passion in the home of flamenco, Don Juan and Carmen. Barely a third of Andalusians bothered to vote in the referendum that said yes to the charter. Both the ruling Socialists and the opposition People's Party were in favour.
The new charter demonstrates the growing power of the 17 autonomous regions into which Spain divided itself after Franco. Although the country is not a federation, it increasingly looks like one. Spain is one of Europe's most decentralised states--more than some overtly federal ones, says Francisco Balaguer, at Granada University. The regions control some 36% of public spending. Ministries in Madrid are seeing their budgets dwindle fast.
Andalusia is the third region (after Valencia and Catalonia) to get a revised charter since the federalism-friendly prime minister, Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero, came to office in 2004. Others, like Galicia and the Basque country, should follow later. By the end of his (hoped-for) second term in 2012, Mr Zapatero wants to have all 17 regions fitted out with new charters. The opposition is officially against, but their local chiefs, like politicians anywhere, rarely dislike extra power. 
The new charters combine bureaucratic detail with romantic verbosity. Local preferences loom large: the Catalans want to protect their language; left-leaning Andalusians want free school textbooks, publicly financed flamenco and equal numbers of men and women on public bodies. But some features are common, especially the paeans of praise for distinctiveness, cultural and historical. 
There is confusion too. Should the government divide the pie by size, population or wealth? Each region offers reasons why it should be high up the pecking order. So far, Catalonia has been the pushiest and most successful. Others want to catch up. All charters must be vetted by the Madrid parliament, which tends to water them down. The Constitutional Court might yet strike out bits of the Catalan charter.
Nor do the charters give any right of secession, much as some Basques and Catalans would like one. Words are carefully chosen: Andalusia is a ""nationality"", not a ""nation"". The Catalans' charter admits that, although they think of themselves as being a nation, the rest of Spain does not. 
Tussles over centralism have bedevilled Spanish politics since Boabdil's last sigh. Some worry about cost and the creation of new boondoggles for public officials.

ENEL'S raid took everyone by surprise. Rafael Miranda, the boss of Endesa, Spain's biggest electricity company, was in Frankfurt on February 27th for a breakfast with German journalists when Enel, Italy's state-controlled electricity giant, swooped to buy almost 10% of his firm. Mr Miranda rushed back to Madrid to try to work out where this leaves the takeover bid for his company by E.ON, a German utility. He supports the German offer--after some grumbling about the price. 
E.ON says it will pursue its bid for Endesa in spite of the Italians' unexpected sally. But the chances of success for the biggest (and longest-running) takeover in utilities history suddenly look very small. The Germans are now faced not only with staunch opposition from the Spanish government and resistance by a powerful Spanish shareholder, but also with a cash-rich and expansion-hungry Italian rival. 
The Spanish government opposed the German bid from the outset because, like most European governments, it is keen to create a home-grown energy champion in anticipation of full deregulation of the energy market in July. It even backed a lower offer for Endesa by Gas Natural, another Spanish energy firm, despite its rejection by the antitrust authorities in Madrid. In November 2006 the government found an ally in Acciona, a Spanish construction firm, which built a stake of more than 21% in Endesa and says it wants full control. For its part, Enel is planning to increase its stake in Endesa to 24.9%, above which it has to launch a full bid for the company. 
E.ON's bid must clear two hurdles to succeed. The first is a shareholder vote at the general meeting on March 20th to remove provisions in Endesa's bylaws capping any investor's vote at 10%. Acciona has already signalled that it will abstain from the vote. Enel will probably do the same, as will Sepi, a state-controlled holding company, which holds another 3% of Endesa shares. This means it will be practically impossible to get the required 50% of Endesa shareholders to vote in favour of a change in the firm's statutes. The second hurdle is the acquisition of at least 50.1% of Endesa's shares. If Enel gets permission from the Spanish energy regulator to raise its stake in Endesa to 24.9%, more than half of Endesa will belong to Spanish and Italian firms unwilling to sell to the Germans. 
It has done no good to Spain's reputation among international investors, but the Spanish government is thus likely to keep Endesa Spanish, or at least southern European. Its bias became blatantly obvious this week. A Spanish solution was more likely than a German victory, said Joan Clos, Spain's industry minister, in a radio interview on February 26th. He said this would involve ""some sort of pact"".
Last week Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero, the Spanish prime minister, and Romano Prodi, his wobbly Italian counterpart, met on the island of Ibiza. Both sides deny discussing energy, let alone some form of deal. But in return for Enel's move into the Spanish energy sector, Spain's Abertis may suddenly find that it is able to merge with Italy's Autostrade; or Telefonica, the Spanish telecoms giant, might miraculously find it easier to buy into Telecom Italia--two deals the Italian government has hitherto been blocking.",230,Spain,"Italy's Enel stamps on E.ON's long-running bid for Spain's Endesa

AFTER inspecting nearly a thousand foot soldiers and just over two dozen camel-mounted cavalry, the leader of the self-proclaimed Sahrawi Arab Democratic Republic marked the 31st birthday of his would-be state last week with a firm, if tired, message: the people of the Western Sahara would accept nothing less than a referendum allowing for self-determination and independence from Morocco. A proposal for Western Saharan autonomy that the Moroccans are busy promoting was dismissed with disdain. But such defiance comes at a time when prospects for the Sahrawi independence movement look as bleak as the barren land that it controls and from which its leader, Muhammad Abdelaziz, was speaking. 
Before Spain pulled its troops out of its colony of Western Sahara in 1976, it ceded the territory to Morocco and Mauritania. The Polisario Front, a Sahrawi guerrilla group that had already been fighting the Spaniards, took up arms against the new enemy. It forced the Mauritanians back, but Morocco poured resources and settlers into the land it had claimed, and later sealed it off with a trench-cum-wall 1,500 miles (2,400km) long. A ceasefire in 1991 provided for a referendum, but Morocco has since backed away from any vote that includes the option of independence, as Polisario demands. A former American secretary of state, James Baker, resigned in 2004 as the UN's special envoy after seven grinding years of trying to end the row. 
West of the wall, which is protected by sophisticated military equipment and an estimated 5m mines, the Sahrawis are now outnumbered by Moroccan settlers by at least two to one. Smouldering protest against Moroccan rule, which the Polisario calls its intifada, is energetically repressed. A UN report leaked last year said that the human-rights record in the territory was of ""serious concern"". 
Meanwhile, the Sahrawi refugees who fled the conflict in 1976 languish over the border in Algeria, Polisario's main ally. Polisario estimates that there are 165,000 refugees subsisting on foreign aid; life in the camps, it says, has been getting tougher. Floods in February last year destroyed many of the makeshift houses, while the UN cut food aid--under pressure, says Polisario, from Morocco; and some of the aid reportedly ends up on market stalls in Algeria and Mauritania. For the first time in decades a lucky few Sahrawis have been able to visit families in the Moroccan-controlled territory under a UN programme but at least 7,000 are still waiting to do so. 
Morocco says it will put its autonomy plan for the Western Sahara to the UN next month. Under its proposals, the Sahrawis are expected to be offered a parliament with power over minor policies, cabinet ministries, and their own judiciary. But Morocco would fly its flag over the territory, the currency and stamps would be Moroccan, and Morocco's king, Mohamed VI, would be the highest religious authority in the land. 
But Morocco seems unlikely to get majority support from the UN Security Council currently led by South Africa, which in 2004 joined a list of more than 70 mainly African and Latin American countries that recognise the Sahrawi Arab Democratic Republic. Even if the proposal did win support, Polisario leaders have vowed to reject it. They accuse Morocco of playing for time while trying to entrench its presence in the Western Sahara and continuing to exploit stocks of phosphate (the territory's biggest earner) and fish. 
But neither does Polisario appear to have much chance of winning the heavyweight backing that might break the diplomatic deadlock. Following the failure of Mr Baker's mission and more recently the resignation of John Bolton (who took a close interest in the subject) as the American ambassador to the UN, America has become less engaged. The Spanish prime minister, Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero, who was recently in the Moroccan capital, Rabat, has made no serious effort to broker a deal. And Morocco has enjoyed unwavering support from France, a permanent member of the UN Security Council and still the most influential European country in the area. As the French vie to protect their influence there against America, they will not want to be seen to withdraw support from a key ally.",230,Spain,"Morocco's latest initiative is unlikely to end one of Africa's oldest conflicts

For the first time in decades a lucky few Sahrawis have been able to visit families in the Moroccan-controlled territory under a UN programme but at least 7,000 are still waiting to do so. 
Morocco says it will put its autonomy plan for the Western Sahara to the UN next month. Under its proposals, the Sahrawis are expected to be offered a parliament with power over minor policies, cabinet ministries, and their own judiciary. But Morocco would fly its flag over the territory, the currency and stamps would be Moroccan, and Morocco's king, Mohamed VI, would be the highest religious authority in the land. 
But Morocco seems unlikely to get majority support from the UN Security Council currently led by South Africa, which in 2004 joined a list of more than 70 mainly African and Latin American countries that recognise the Sahrawi Arab Democratic Republic. Even if the proposal did win support, Polisario leaders have vowed to reject it. They accuse Morocco of playing for time while trying to entrench its presence in the Western Sahara and continuing to exploit stocks of phosphate (the territory's biggest earner) and fish. 
But neither does Polisario appear to have much chance of winning the heavyweight backing that might break the diplomatic deadlock. Following the failure of Mr Baker's mission and more recently the resignation of John Bolton (who took a close interest in the subject) as the American ambassador to the UN, America has become less engaged. The Spanish prime minister, Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero, who was recently in the Moroccan capital, Rabat, has made no serious effort to broker a deal. And Morocco has enjoyed unwavering support from France, a permanent member of the UN Security Council and still the most influential European country in the area. As the French vie to protect their influence there against America, they will not want to be seen to withdraw support from a key ally.",True

The Pentagon released an edited transcript of a closed-doors military hearing in which Khalid Sheikh Mohammed confirmed that he had masterminded the September 11th 2001 attacks. He also claimed involvement in a string of other terrorist acts and plots, such as the 1993 car bombing at New York's World Trade Centre, a failed plot to bomb Big Ben in London and attempts to kill Pope John Paul II and President Pervez Musharraf of Pakistan. The hearing took place at Guantanamo Bay to consider whether Mr Mohammed can be detained as an ""enemy combatant"".
The Democrats called for the resignation of America's attorney-general, Alberto Gonzales, when he admitted that mistakes had been made in last year's sacking of eight United States attorneys, who prosecute federal cases. White House officials were involved in the sackings, which the Democrats claim were politically motivated and not based on judicial performance. 
George Bush asked for an additional 4,700 troops to join the ""surge"" in Iraq, on top of the 21,500 ordered to go in January. Meanwhile, agreement was finally reached in the Senate about the terms of the Democrats' resolution on Iraq, allowing debate to proceed. 
Meeting and greeting
George Bush completed his tour of five Latin American countries in which he talked of ""social justice"" and aid for health and education, as well as ethanol and immigration reform. He was greeted with small demonstrations by local left-wingers. Hugo Chavez, Venezuela's president, after a visit to Argentina where he called Mr Bush ""a political corpse"" at a rally, went on a seemingly improvised counter-tour of four countries.
Ecuador's conflict of powers continued. Police barred 57 opposition legislators from entering Congress after the electoral tribunal declared them expelled. At issue is a plan by Rafael Correa, the leftist president, to hold a referendum for a constituent assembly that would replace Congress.
In Colombia, a departmental governor from the opposition Liberal party surrendered to federal prosecutors investigating links between politicians and right-wing paramilitary groups. Eight other politicians, all supporters of President Alvaro Uribe, already face similar charges.
Whew!
Tony Blair faced the biggest Labour revolt in Parliament since the vote on the Iraq war in 2003. Some 95 backbenchers voted against renewing Britain's Trident nuclear- deterrent system. The prime minister, who is due to leave office this summer, won approval for his bill only with the support of the Conservative opposition. 
Two British soldiers were acquitted of charges relating to the abuse of nine Iraqi detainees (one of whom died from his injuries) in Basra in 2003. Four other soldiers were acquitted last month. A seventh is due to be sentenced next month after pleading guilty. 
Jacques Chirac announced that he would not stand again for the French presidency. The battle to succeed him is wide open, with the centrist Francois Bayrou now nipping at the heels of the two front-runners, Nicolas Sarkozy and Segolene Royal. These three are some way ahead of the National Front's Jean-Marie Le Pen, who confirmed that he too is in the contest.
A huge demonstration against ETA, the Basque terrorist group, was staged in Madrid. The city also marked the third anniversary of the train bombings on March 11th 2004. Both events spelt trouble for Spain's prime minister, Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero, whose popularity has fallen sharply as voters see him as accommodating to terrorists.
United Russia, the main pro-Putin party, won 13 out of 14 regional elections in Russia. The 14th went to a new party, Just Russia, which is also loyal to President Vladimir Putin.
Mr Putin met the pope in Rome for the first time. Relations between the Roman Catholic and Russian Orthodox churches are strained. While he was in Italy, Mr Putin also finalised a bilateral gas deal with the Italian prime minister, Romano Prodi.
Security comfort blanket
Japan signed a security pact with Australia (its first such deal with a country other than the United States) to bolster co-operation on issues such as intelligence and border protection. The pact was interpreted by some as a response to China's growing power in the east Pacific.

Last November's peace deal between the government and Maoist rebels agreed that the future of the monarchy should be decided after assembly elections this year.
In India, Naxalite rebels killed some 50 police officers when they stormed a security post in Chhattisgarh state, the most daring incident in a spate of recent attacks. 
Muslim separatists were blamed for a gun attack on a minibus in southern Thailand that left nine people, all Buddhists, dead. The region has seen an increase in violence; some 2,000 people have been killed in the past two years.

IT WAS a difficult call. Spain's Socialist prime minister, Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero, could have let Inaki De Juana, an imprisoned member of the Basque separatist group ETA, die on hunger strike. But that would destroy any short-term hopes of ETA laying down its arms. Or he could have sent the prisoner home under house arrest to serve out the last part of a three-year sentence for making terrorist threats. That would anger not just the opposition People's Party (PP), but most Spaniards.
In the event Mr Zapatero chose the second course. Was this cowardly, foolish--or brave? Most Spaniards incline to the first two adjectives. Polls say that 59% wanted Mr De Juana kept under lock and key. Few cared if he became a separatist martyr. 
Mr De Juana, who had previously served a long prison term for 25 killings, is now in the comfort of a hospital bed in the Basque country and will soon go home. But Mr Zapatero is suffering. His poll ratings have plummeted. The De Juana affair has proved to be a political gift for the PP leader, Mariano Rajoy. He drew several hundred thousand people to Madrid on March 10th to parade behind banners proclaiming ""No more concessions to ETA"". 
Even more ominously for Mr Zapatero, the De Juana decision has put terrorism at the centre of Spanish politics. That is what the PP has wanted since March 11th 2004, when bombs planted by Islamist terrorists killed 191 people on four trains in Madrid. Three days later voters threw the PP out of power in a general election. The PP has spent the past three years fanning improbable conspiracy theories about the train bombings, most of which are based on the notion that ETA was somehow involved.
Mr Zapatero, these conspiracy theorists claim, is trying to cover up the facts. Yet the current trial of 29 mainly Muslim men suspected of involvement in the bombings has turned up no ETA connection. The police also insist that they have found nothing. Opinion polls nevertheless show that fully a third of Spaniards mistrust the official version. 
Terrorism is now drowning out most other political debate. The PP's anti-ETA message is being heard loud and clear; its calls for economic liberalisation barely make a mark. Mr Zapatero's decision to release Mr De Juana has similarly stopped Spaniards from taking in the news that the economy racked up 3.9% growth in 2006, the fastest since 2000.
With the dead from the train bombings and from four decades of ETA violence at the heart of such an emotive debate, the political temperature in Spain is rising. For some it is already too hot. Even the survivors of terrorism and the relatives of the dead are divided. Most train-bomb victims disavow the PP's attempts to blame ETA. Most ETA victims dislike Mr Zapatero's attempts to talk peace. Both groups are trundled out by the political parties to argue their cases. Several have had enough. ""Who is going to smooth away the pain that is being added to our existing pain?"" demanded Pilar Manjon, head of an association of train-bomb victims, on March 11th, as a monument was unveiled at a tense ceremony to mark the third anniversary of the 2004 attacks.
It is dismaying that ETA now finds it so easy to set Spain's political agenda. A much-weakened group that has killed only four people in the past four years (compared with 800 in the previous 36) now exerts an influence that far outweighs its capacity for violence. The De Juana case was the second big test of Mr Zapatero's resolve to talk peace. ETA had already tried him in December, when it broke a nine-month-old ceasefire by exploding a car bomb at Madrid airport, killing two Ecuadoreans. Even so, it has been claiming that the ceasefire remains in place.
Now Mr Zapatero must decide whether to allow ETA's banned political wing, Batasuna, to rename itself and stand in May's local elections. Saying yes could keep the Basque peace process shakily on track. But Mr Zapatero has said that Batasuna must first explicitly renounce all support for violence. He is no longer in a strong enough position to take more risks.

MEDIA barons make tricky foes. They often have strong personalities and stronger opinions. Some have sharp tongues. Woe betide any politicians who get on the wrong side of them.

Its foe is Jess de Polanco, boss of Grupo PRISA, Spain's biggest media group, which owns the left-leaning daily, El Pais, and a raft of radio and television stations.

LOCAL elections seldom matter. But as Spaniards vote for councils and mayors on May 27th, more than local politics is at stake. In the Basque country, peace is in the balance. Efforts by the Socialist prime minister, Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero, to strike a peace deal with ETA terrorists face a big test. Some observers expect ETA to resume its attacks after the vote. It all contrasts starkly with an end to political violence in another troubled region: Northern Ireland.
ETA's political ally, Batasuna, has no formal candidates in the election, thanks to a ban imposed in 2003. Demand for its reinstatement have fallen on deaf ears. Indeed, Mr Zapatero's government has put the banning law to wider use, to deal with some new militant separatists. Both they and the opposition People's Party are outraged. To the separatists, it has been too tough; to the PP, not tough enough. ETA may use the exclusion of Batasuna as an excuse to resume bombings.
Why have things apparently gone right in Northern Ireland but not in the Basque country? Spanish politicians say the two places are not comparable. Northern Ireland had two lots of terrorists--the IRA and Protestant paramilitaries. The Basques have but one: ETA. Some argue that peace deals are possible when two sides are at war, as in Northern Ireland, but not when one is fighting and the other is the state. A peace deal with a still armed ETA, the same logic goes, is impossible. The only solution is unconditional surrender.
Some Spaniards do not consider Northern Ireland such a success, either. They claim the Spanish model of intransigence practised before Mr Zapatero came to power in 2004 worked better. ""The process in Northern Ireland has some very high costs,"" says Rogelio Alonso, of Rey Juan Carlos University, pointing to the ruling alliance of hardline Protestants with Sinn Fein. ""It has strengthened the extremes at the cost of moderates."" In any event ETA shows no signs of readiness to surrender: in December it killed two people in a bomb attack at Madrid's Barajas airport.
There are lessons to be learnt from Northern Ireland about getting terrorists to realise that violence is not helping them. Patience and fortitude, the negotiators' main virtues, are another. Mr Zapatero has made clear his admiration for Tony Blair's role in the Northern Ireland peace process. Advisers claim that he seeks Mr Blair's advice, though British diplomats say contact has been minimal. Mr Blair nevertheless offered Mr Zapatero encouragement at their last meeting in October.
One big difference between the two situations is that Mr Blair was backed by the opposition Conservatives. Mr Zapatero has gone it alone, because the PP insists on unconditional surrender. So any failures, airport bombs included, are potential vote losers. The future of the Basque peace process depends as much on the Socialists' showing at the local elections as on ETA's reaction. A general election is due next spring. A poor result this weekend could turn Mr Zapatero off the whole risky business of pursuing peace.

AS ITALY'S bishops concluded their general assembly on May 25th, some may have reflected on an irony in their situation. In a secular age, and 13 years after the collapse of the Christian Democratic party that used to represent their interests in politics, the church wields more direct influence in Italy than at any time in 40 years.
Over the past three years, church leaders and their parliamentary allies have fought three big battles and lost none. In 2004 a cross-party group of lawmakers drastically restricted the scope of a law on fertility treatment. A year later, the head of the church in Rome, Cardinal Camillo Ruini, deftly foiled a bid to broaden the law in a referendum (he asked the faithful to abstain, robbing the vote of its quorum). And in February, when a former prime minister, Giulio Andreotti, now a life senator and ever the church's political man, nudged Romano Prodi's centre-left government close to defeat, the coalition dropped as a priority its plan to extend legal rights to unwed couples, including gays.
Under Cardinal Ruini's successor, Angelo Bagnasco, Italy's prelates are preparing for a fight against a law to allow living wills, which set out how people wish to be treated if they can no longer communicate with doctors themselves. At the general assembly, Archbishop Bagnasco's deputy, Giuseppe Betori, claimed that such wills represented ""a dangerous slide towards something like euthanasia"".
Vatican officials say Pope Benedict is determined to stop Italy following Spain under the Zapatero government, which legalised gay marriage and made other social reforms at odds with Catholic teaching. The pope sees Italy as uniquely emblematic of Roman Catholicism and thus ideal ground for an attack against the creeping secularisation of Europe. Italy's contorted politics may make this easier.
The Prodi government's hold on power is feeble (and became feebler this week after it took a drubbing in local elections, especially in the north). It depends on unelected life senators for its majority in the upper house and so is vulnerable to even a small rebellion on its own side. This includes a tiny Christian Democratic party, the UDEUR, and a band of traditional Roman Catholics in the otherwise liberal Democracy and Freedom party, who are known to the media as the ""Theo-Dems"". Were they to vote against the government on any measure distasteful to the bishops, they could join the centre-right opposition in bringing it down.
That may seem odd. After all, Silvio Berlusconi, the opposition leader, is eminently secular. Before entering politics, his friendships were mostly with Socialists, not Christian Democrats. He is divorced and had three children by his present wife before their (civil) marriage. Only one of the four parties in the coalition government that he led until last year was particularly Catholic: the Union of Christian Democrats.
But, argues Stefano Ceccanti, a law professor who helped to draft the law on unmarried couples, ""the centre-right is very weak ideologically and it finds unity in agreeing with the church"". Italian conservatives shrink from free-market liberalism. The creeds that gave them their ideological underpinnings--fascism and Christian Democracy--have been discredited. Championing Catholic causes now helps both to woo Catholic voters and to divide Mr Prodi's heterogeneous coalition, which stretches from the Theo-Dems to Trotskyists. Conservatives, including non-believers, also consider a church led by Pope Benedict to be a stout bulwark against Islamic fundamentalism.
On other issues, too, there is an overlap between the views of the centre-right and those of the church. Ezio Mauro, editor of the daily La Repubblica, has accused Cardinal Ruini of pulling the church to the right. Indeed, the bishops' most passionate defender in recent months has been another daily newspaper editor, Giuliano Ferrara of Il Foglio, a former Berlusconi minister who is an atheist. ""Without being a Catholic"", he says, ""I think many Catholic things.""
How far can the bishops go to impose Catholic views on society? Church leaders often behave as if Italy were still as homogeneously Catholic as in the days when every Italian home had a crucifix above the marital bed and a black-and-white television from which Pius XII would occasionally bestow a restrained wave. After church groups rallied several hundred thousand people to a family day in Rome on May 12th, Archbishop Bagnasco declared smugly that it was ""society expressing itself in an unequivocal way"".
Yet today's Italy has one of the world's lowest birth rates, thanks to near-universal defiance of Vatican teaching on contraception. A quarter of young cohabiting couples are unmarried. Church sociologists insist that the share of Italians attending mass at least once a month remains steady at 50%, but a study publicised in February suggests that the true figure is lower (23% in the patriarchate of Venice, where the research was conducted).
""The whole of society is not Roman Catholic,"" says Marcello Vigli, a lay activist and veteran of the Christian Social movement. ""So you cannot impose by law what the hierarchy considers to be right. Otherwise, you start to become a confessional society."" To Giuliano Ferrara of Il Foglio, such a view is pure hypocrisy. ""If the church has a right to say what it thinks, it also has a right to be on the political scene. What it does not have is a right to coerce."" Many Italians would agree. But some argue that it does, in practice, coerce. In March Archbishop Bagnasco's office in effect told those politicians who consider themselves Catholic to vote against granting legal rights to unmarried couples.
His supporters retort that he was merely reminding lawmakers of church teaching; and that, in any case, the bishops' position coincided with the dominant social view (47-45% against the bill, said a poll in another daily, Corriere della Sera). But Archbishop Bagnasco's warning caused deep resentment among supporters of the measure, all the more so after he appeared to bracket them with apologists for paedophilia and incest.
Soon after that remark, threatening graffiti appeared on the door of his cathedral in Genoa. He then received an envelope containing a bullet and the symbol of the Red Brigades' terror group. He has now been given an armed police guard. Addressing the bishops' assembly, Pope Benedict said that ""the Catholic faith and the church's presence remain the great unifying factor of this beloved nation"". Of late, it has not always seemed that way.",230,Spain,"A resurgent Vatican's influence in Italy
AS ITALY'S bishops concluded their general assembly on May 25th, some may have reflected on an irony in their situation. In a secular age, and 13 years after the collapse of the Christian Democratic party that used to represent their interests in politics, the church wields more direct influence in Italy than at any time in 40 years.

Amid the usual noisy demonstrations from anti-globalisation protesters, the annual G8 summit met in Heiligendamm, northern Germany. Thanks to American opposition (and a new proposal for negotiations that George Bush unveiled last week), the summit looked unlikely to reach agreement on climate change, which its host Angela Merkel had put top of the agenda.
The pre-summit atmosphere was soured by Russia's president, Vladimir Putin. He threatened to retaliate against the deployment of limited American missile defences in Poland and the Czech Republic by targeting Russia's nuclear missiles on Europe again.
Rumours that Turkey had invaded northern Iraq in force were denied. But Turkish troops and armour continued to mass on the border. Senior figures in both the army and the government favour a cross-border operation in pursuit of Kurdish PKK fighters.
The Basque separatist group ETA formally ended the ceasefire that it had declared in March 2006. The announcement was a blow to the Spanish prime minister, Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero, who had stuck his neck out to negotiate with ETA. He faces a general election next March.
The European Union decided to recommence talks with Serbia on a stabilisation agreement, the usual prelude to membership talks, which had been suspended last year because of Serbia's failure to hand over the Bosnian Serb wartime general, Ratko Mladic, to the war-crimes tribunal at The Hague. Some diplomats expect Serbia to catch Mr Mladic soon.
War weary
Israel held training exercises for a possible clash with Syria as Ehud Olmert, the prime minister, tried to dampen fears at home of a war this summer. But, in a change from previous statements, he said Israel would like to hold direct talks with Syria.
France argued for an aid corridor from Chad into Sudan's war-torn Darfur region to help the relief operation there. France is the only Western country with troops already in Chad that could protect such a channel.
A joint report by two UN agencies, the Food and Agriculture Organisation and the World Food Programme, said that 2.1m Zimbabweans may be dangerously short of food by the third quarter of this year. That figure may rise to more than 4m (a third of all Zimbabweans) in the first three months of next year.
The trial of Liberia's former president, Charles Taylor, began in The Hague. He has been indicted on 11 charges of war crimes and crimes against humanity for his alleged role in a civil war in Sierra Leone; the trial could last for up to 18 months.
Jail time
Lewis ""Scooter"" Libby, the former chief of staff to Dick Cheney, was sentenced to two-and-a-half years in prison for perjury and for obstructing an investigation into the naming of a CIA officer, whose husband had criticised the administration over Iraq. Mr Libby was convicted in March, but some conservative pundits and politicians are asking George Bush to use his powers to pardon him because, they say, he is just a scapegoat.
William Jefferson, a Democratic congressman from New Orleans, was indicted by federal authorities on 16 charges for allegedly accepting bribes. He resigned from his seat on the House of Representatives' small-business committee, but Republicans said the Democrats were moving too slowly to eject him from Congress.
War-crimes charges against two detainees held at Guantanamo Bay were dismissed by military judges on the ground that the accused had not been designated as ""unlawful"" enemy combatants, as required for their trial before the new military commissions. It is the latest setback for the administration's much-criticised system for dealing with suspected terrorists.
The Republican presidential candidates held their third debate. As well as Iraq (where Mr Bush was criticised on all sides), the deal on immigration legislation reached between the White House and key senators was to the fore. Several candidates also endorsed the possibility of using tactical nuclear weapons against Iran if it refused to end its nuclear programme. The Democratic candidates' second debate was, by contrast, a tame affair.
Spoiling the plot
Ten people in America were arrested in connection with an alleged plot to topple the government of Laos. Vang Pao, an ethnic Hmong and a former military commander, and others were accused of trying to buy guns, missiles and explosives to prepare for an attempted coup.
In the midst of a domestic crisis, General Pervez Musharraf, Pakistan's president, issued a decree giving regulators new powers to curb broadcasters. After widespread protests, the government promised not to implement the decree until it had been reviewed by a committee.
China produced its first national plan for tackling climate change, pledging to curb its greenhouse-gas emissions, but not at the expense of economic growth. In Australia, John Howard, the prime minister, announced a change of policy, committing the country to capping emissions regardless of China's actions.
Zakia Zaki, the owner of a radio station in Afghanistan, was shot dead at her home. Ms Zaki's murder followed that of a female newsreader. The journalists' association said the killings showed how difficult the working climate had become for journalists, especially women.

SO HOW long is permanent? Just over 14 months ago the Basque separatist group ETA trumpeted its promise of a ""permanent ceasefire"". It first broke its word as early as last December when it blew up a van at Madrid airport, killing two Ecuadoreans. This week it backed actions with words, formally declaring its supposedly permanent truce at an end.
Coming soon after his Socialist Party did badly in local elections, this is a huge blow to Spain's prime minister, Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero. Over the past three years he has personally gone out of his way to start a Basque peace process and keep it going. December's airport bombing was a big setback for him. The ending of the ceasefire, which seems sure to be followed by a renewed outbreak of violence, is likely to damage him even more--and could yet put paid to his party's chances of winning next March's election (see page 38).
The cynicism of ETA's ceasefire, which it not only broke but also used to rearm itself, has been shameless. Yet it is a weaker organisation than it was. It has killed only four people in the past four years, compared with 800 in the previous 36. The Spanish police now co-operate more effectively with their French counterparts. Even so, it is wrong to believe, as Spain's opposition People's Party (PP) avers, that ETA terrorism can be dealt with by force and punishment alone.
Are there parallels and contrasts to be drawn between ETA and the IRA in Northern Ireland? Certainly, there is a dismaying difference between the resumption of Basque terrorism and last month's power-sharing deal between Ian Paisley of Ulster's Democratic Unionists and Martin McGuinness of Sinn Fein. Yet such comparisons are seldom exact. The Basque region has long had far more power devolved to it than Northern Ireland. It has no equivalent to the sectarian divide of Catholics and Protestants, nor to the dual involvement of two governments, Britain's in London and Ireland's in Dublin. Spain's moves towards federalism are a work in progress that bears little resemblance to anything happening in Britain.
There are, however, two other differences with Northern Ireland that the politicians in Madrid should reflect upon and learn from. One is that British governments seem less exercised about any threat that a part of their country might one day break away. If a clear majority in Northern Ireland--or in Scotland, for that matter--voted for independence, most politicians in London would accept the result. In contrast, all governments in Madrid remain pathologically hostile to any such idea anywhere in Spain.
No time for partisanship
The second difference is that, right from its inception in the mid-1980s, support for the Northern Ireland peace process was wholly bipartisan. The Labour opposition at Westminster firmly backed the Tories in their negotiations with Dublin and with Sinn Fein, under both Margaret Thatcher and John Major. Similarly, the Conservative opposition has been solidly behind Tony Blair.
In contrast, the PP has fiercely resisted Mr Zapatero's every move over the Basque problem. The party remains bitter about its unexpected loss of the March 2004 election, which fell a few days after the Madrid train bombings. Many in the PP still insist that ETA was somehow involved, despite all the evidence that the bombings were the work of Islamist terrorists. It was brave, if perhaps naive, of Mr Zapatero to try to make peace in the Basque region on his own. But the PP's hostility made his task vastly more difficult. A prerequisite for future plans to deal with ETA must be that the two main parties in Spain find common ground first.",230,Spain,"Europe's worst nationalist terrorist problem badly needs a bipartisan approach

AFTER two of his worst weeks since coming to power in March 2004, Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero, Spain's prime minister, looks suddenly vulnerable. On May 27th his Socialists fell behind the opposition People's Party (PP) in local elections, notably in Madrid, where anti-Zapatero feeling runs high. Then on June 6th ETA, the Basque separatist movement, called off its 14-month ceasefire (already fractured when it killed two victims in a bombing at Madrid airport in December).
A general election is due in March; and, until now, the idea that Mr Zapatero might not win a second term was absurd. Since its defeat in 2004, the PP has seemed intent on self-destruction. Its apocalyptic rhetoric over everything from gay marriage to Catalan autonomy scared many centrist voters. But the PP has recently calmed down. In place of conspiracy theories linking ETA to the 2004 train bombings in Madrid, it now says it will trust the courts to decide. Talk of Spain being torn apart by devolution has subsided as judges consider whether the new Catalan autonomy charter breaches the constitution.
The PP has a new air of confidence. At the election in March 2004, the party's healthy lead in the opinion polls evaporated when it mishandled the aftermath of the Madrid train bombings. It has since trailed the Socialists in opinion polls. But the local elections brought its leader, Mariano Rajoy, his first country-wide victory: wafer-thin, with 35.6% of the vote against 34.9% for the Socialists, but still a win. For the past two decades, the winner of local elections has always won the subsequent general election.
Mr Zapatero is largely to blame for the Socialists' decline. He picked his former economic adviser, Miguel Sebastian, as candidate for mayor of Madrid; Mr Sebastian did disastrously. Socialist malcontents complain that the ETA peace process, another personal initiative, put off voters. Yet although many in the PP will rejoice both at Mr Zapatero's discomfort and at the demise of a peace process they hated, public glee might be counterproductive. Responsibility for calling off the ceasefire lies firmly with ETA, but Mr Rajoy's refusal to back the peace process, and his insistence on ETA's unconditional surrender, hampered negotiations.
ETA may be re-energised and is certainly rearmed (it stole 350 pistols from a French arms depot last October). How to deal with it will now be a big election issue. Some reckon that Spain's democratic parties need to recreate the anti-ETA alliance that fell apart at the end of the 1990s. But getting the powerful, moderate, Basque Nationalist Party to sit at the same table as the PP will be tricky: if violence starts up again, the PP may try to make political capital out of it, and the nationalists, who backed peace, will not want to risk the PP mocking their efforts.
With Spain's housing boom slowing and the constitutional court considering striking out bits of the Catalan charter, Mr Zapatero has little else going for him. If the court now trying 29 people accused of the Madrid train bombings does rule out other conspiracy theories, that could help him. But any more wrong moves in the next nine months, or a prolonged outbreak of ETA violence, could spell disaster in next year's general election.

The PP has a new air of confidence. At the election in March 2004, the party's healthy lead in the opinion polls evaporated when it mishandled the aftermath of the Madrid train bombings. It has since trailed the Socialists in opinion polls. But the local elections brought its leader, Mariano Rajoy, his first country-wide victory: wafer-thin, with 35.6% of the vote against 34.9% for the Socialists, but still a win. For the past two decades, the winner of local elections has always won the subsequent general election.
Mr Zapatero is largely to blame for the Socialists' decline. He picked his former economic adviser, Miguel Sebastian, as candidate for mayor of Madrid; Mr Sebastian did disastrously. Socialist malcontents complain that the ETA peace process, another personal initiative, put off voters. Yet although many in the PP will rejoice both at Mr Zapatero's discomfort and at the demise of a peace process they hated, public glee might be counterproductive. Responsibility for calling off the ceasefire lies firmly with ETA, but Mr Rajoy's refusal to back the peace process, and his insistence on ETA's unconditional surrender, hampered negotiations.
ETA may be re-energised and is certainly rearmed (it stole 350 pistols from a French arms depot last October). How to deal with it will now be a big election issue. Some reckon that Spain's democratic parties need to recreate the anti-ETA alliance that fell apart at the end of the 1990s. But getting the powerful, moderate, Basque Nationalist Party to sit at the same table as the PP will be tricky: if violence starts up again, the PP may try to make political capital out of it, and the nationalists, who backed peace, will not want to risk the PP mocking their efforts.
With Spain's housing boom slowing and the constitutional court considering striking out bits of the Catalan charter, Mr Zapatero has little else going for him. If the court now trying 29 people accused of the Madrid train bombings does rule out other conspiracy theories, that could help him. But any more wrong moves in the next nine months, or a prolonged outbreak of ETA violence, could spell disaster in next year's general election.

COMMUTER traffic crawls along Avenida Balboa, the coastal road that is the spine of Panama City, slowed by thousands of new cars. In the city's wealthier districts restaurants are packed, and it is hard to find a street without a skyscraper under construction. While some of its neighbours in Central America struggle with commodity-based economies, Panama is busy reinventing itself as a regional logistics and services hub.
That was a position it enjoyed in the 1970s, when an offshore financial industry briefly flourished. Then came the dark years of Manuel Noriega, a thuggish strongman toppled by an American invasion in 1989. Several undistinguished governments followed.
Several things have now come together to produce an extraordinary boom in Panama. The economy will expand by 11% this year and by over 9% in both 2008 and 2009, according to a forecast by LatinSource, a consultancy. That is faster than anywhere else in Latin America.
The first was the transfer of sovereignty over the Panama Canal in 1999. Since then, the canal has been run as a Panamanian business, rather than a branch of the United States' federal bureaucracy. President Martin Torrijos, who took office in 2004 (and whose father, a military ruler, negotiated the canal handover in the 1970s), pushed through a referendum last year which approved a $5.2 billion plan to expand the canal, doubling its capacity and enabling it to take much bigger ships. Work is due to start in August.
Other big projects are planned in the wake of the canal expansion. Occidental Petroleum, in partnership with Qatar Petroleum, plans an oil refinery, costing $7 billion, at Puerto Armuelles. A consortium led by Hutchison Whampoa, a Hong Kong company, plans to turn Balboa into the largest port in Latin America. China's government-owned shipping operator, COSCO, is competing to build a second mega-port, this one on the Caribbean coast--even though Panama recognises Taiwan. Copa, a local airline, aspires to turn Panama into an alternative regional hub for travellers deterred by the security hassles of Miami airport.
The second factor is that Mr Torrijos's government has been rather more effective than its predecessors. He has cleaned up the public finances, pushing through an unpopular reform of social security. He actively courts foreign investors. He has negotiated a free-trade agreement with the United States, which Panama hopes will soon be ratified by the American Congress. But he also has close ties to other regional leaders, including Cuba's Ral Castro.
This week Spain's prime minister, Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero, was the latest foreign leader to drop by, with a coterie of businessmen in tow. New foreign direct investment more than doubled in 2006 compared with the previous year, accounting for 16% of GDP--a share that is twice as big as in any other country in the region, according to the UN Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean.
The government has finally got around to developing the prime land once occupied by American military bases in the former Canal Zone. The UN is moving its regional headquarters into one; another will become a technology park. Last week the government signed a contract with London & Regional, a British property company, which plans to build housing and industrial units at the former Howard Air Force base. Some of the new housing is aimed at American retirees, who are flocking to Panama. Donald Trump, an American property developer, is planning a 68-storey hotel and resort.
But as the developers pile in, not everyone is cheering. Some worry that the property bubble will soon burst. Others note that a weak education system does not produce enough engineers or skilled workers. Contractors are likely to import skilled labour from abroad. But with 40% of Panamanians still living in poverty, and unemployment at 8.6% last year (though falling), that will not be popular.
A handful of families continue to control much of the country's wealth and benefit from cosy ties to government while most Panamanians struggle to make ends meet. Mr Torrijos proposes to increase the minimum wage of $300 a month. American diplomats worry that if the benefits of growth don't filter down, the resulting sense of injustice could fuel political radicalisation.
A bigger, related, worry is corruption. Foreign firms are beginning to complain that they are hampered by the informal links between government and local business oligarchs. Sam Taliaferro, an American who runs a property business catering to foreign retirees in Boquete, a hill resort, says that corruption threatens to choke off foreign investment. With three-dozen other investors, he has formed a group to campaign against what he sees as the gouging of foreign firms.
Though Mr Torrijos's government has a cleaner record than its predecessors, it has not been scandal-free. An uncle of the president controversially acquired vacant land, and went on to destroy protected mangrove swamp without the necessary permit. It is hard to judge how deep corruption goes, or how much of an impact it may have on foreign investment. But if Panama's boom is to propel it swiftly to developed-country status over the next decade or so, it would help if it rested on a stronger institutional foundation.

THE naughty ditty that generations of Spanish schoolchildren have sung to one another to the tune of the national anthem is hardly respectful. The words refer, among other things, to the former dictator, General Francisco Franco, his mother and his buttocks.

THE Spanish prime minister, Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero, has bounced back with remarkable speed. In May, his Socialist Party narrowly lost municipal elections to the People's Party (PP). But with a general election due early next year, recent polls give the Socialists a renewed lead of 3.5-6.5 percentage points.
What explains the turnaround? Surprisingly, perhaps, the reason appears to be terrorism and the end of a 14-month ceasefire by the Basque separatist movement, ETA. The collapse of Mr Zapatero's attempt to negotiate peace with ETA would normally count as a failure. But now Mr Zapatero's opponents can no longer accuse him of being soft on terrorism by talking to the gunmen.
In the renewed fight against ETA, the government has, moreover, been doing rather well. Apart from a couple of harmless explosions as the Tour de France cycling race passed through the Navarre region, ETA has been unable to inflict much damage since it took up arms again on June 6th. Meanwhile, hardly a week has gone by without the government trumpeting some new arrest or the foiling of another bomb plot.
The latest arrests on July 26th, of ETA's alleged head of logistics and two helpers, brought to at least 18 the number of ETA members rounded up in the past two months. Like many others, Juan Cruz Maiza and his alleged henchmen were detained in France, where ETA's leadership is based but is increasingly harassed by French police. The group has twice abandoned bomb-making equipment (once in a taxi near Torreblanca, in the east, and once in a car near the Portuguese border at Ayamonte, to the south-west) as its members feared being caught.
The end of the ceasefire has robbed the PP of its strongest weapon. It had spent the whole of the ceasefire period angrily denouncing the prime minister for betraying ETA's victims. The PP leader, Mariano Rajoy, beat the same drum at a state-of-the-nation debate before the summer parliamentary break, but to little effect. His demands that Mr Zapatero hand over the minutes of any meetings with ETA did not get far. Polls showed Spaniards felt Mr Zapatero won the debate hands down. ""Waving around the ghosts of terrorism no longer brings electoral advantages,"" the pro-Zapatero El Pais newspaper noted.
Mr Zapatero has learned the hard way that dealing with terrorists is an unpredictable business. Last December he told Spaniards the peace process was progressing well. A day later ETA set off a bomb that killed two people at Madrid's Barajas airport, in an unequivocal sign that the process was collapsing long before the formal end of the ceasefire. The prime minister is now careful not to sound triumphant. ""We are not without risk,"" he says. ""We must keep working in order to obtain results like those of recent weeks.""
Mr Zapatero knows, too, that a successful terrorist attack can provoke a sharp change of mood in the electorate. His own election in 2004 came immediately after the killing of 191 people on Madrid's commuter trains by Islamist radicals.

POLITICIANS can be more loved when they give up power than when they have it. This seems true of Josu Jon Imaz, leader of the Basque Nationalist Party (PNV). His decision to quit has provoked laments all round, including from the prime minister, Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero. Mr Imaz's party won only 1.6% of the vote in the 2004 general election. But, like the Basque country, the PNV punches above its weight. It has dominated Basque politics for 30 years, leading every regional government since 1980, including that of the current premier, Juan Jose Ibarretxe. And it runs a region that has more autonomy than just about any other in Europe.
It is not, however, its administrative and legislative power over 2.1m Basques that makes the PNV so important to Mr Zapatero. He cares about two other things. The first is the PNV's role as the engine driving what is often the pushiest region in Spain. Where the Basques lead, others (especially Catalonia but also Galicia) try to follow. The second is the party's attitude to, and fraught relationship with, the terrorist group ETA. The PNV would be a vital contributor to any possible peace settlement with ETA; ETA formally ended its ceasefire in June, although (thanks mainly to good police work) it has not since staged any big terrorist outrages.
The PNV is divided both over how hard to press Madrid and over how friendly to be to ETA. Mr Imaz is a moderate ""pactist"" who wants to be tough on ETA and not too pushy with Madrid. His opponents, the ""sovereigntists"", want to be more aggressive with Madrid and gentler on ETA. Mr Imaz's narrow leadership victory four years ago showed how balanced the two factions are. His sovereigntist rival, Joseba Egibar, came within a whisker of victory.
Mr Imaz is against the go-it-alone referendum that has been suggested by the regional government, to ask Basques to decide for themselves what relationship they want with the rest of Spain. The referendum, originally Mr Ibarretxe's idea, is probably illegal under the Spanish constitution. It would certainly trigger a clash with Madrid. But Mr Imaz failed to block a watered-down plan for a referendum in the PNV national council.
By walking away from the leadership, he claimed, there would be no recurrence of the old PNV nightmare: a permanent split. A rival nationalist party, Eusko Alkartasuna, spun off in 1987. And young PNV malcontents helped to create ETA in 1959. The party's future direction now depends on who takes over as leader. Inigo Urkullu, a pactist, is the strongest candidate. But one of the sovereigntists may yet run.
The Basque country is, as ever, being watched intently in Catalonia, which is both bigger and stronger. With a population of 7.1m, Catalonia is home to almost one in six Spaniards. It has plenty of sovereigntists of its own, a few of whom burnt pictures of King Juan Carlos when he visited Barcelona recently. Catalans were also irritated when the Madrid parliament voted this week to bar sub-national sports teams from international competitions.
In Catalonia Mr Zapatero has, at least, done his homework by securing a new autonomy deal that Catalans approved in a referendum last year. He hopes that the new deal has sorted out Catalonia for a generation--and that if a moderate wins the PNV leadership, a similar deal might even work with the Basques.

FRANCISCO FRANCO, caudillo of Spain, must be turning in his grave. Some 32 years after his death, a Socialist government is pushing through a law to honour the dictator's victims, as well as those of the civil war that brought him to power. Final amendments to the ""historical memory"" law were made by a parliamentary committee on October 17th. After years of deliberations and much angry debate, the law seems likely to be approved on October 31st.
This should be a moment of great personal satisfaction for the prime minister, Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero. The new law was one of his campaign pledges in 2004. His own grandfather, a captain in the Spanish army, was a civil-war victim. He stayed loyal to the Republican government after the 1936 military rebellion and, like thousands of other loyalists captured over the next three years, was shot.
The historical memory law is expressly directed at the victims' descendants. The draft mixes grand symbolic gestures with smaller, concrete measures. On the symbolic front, it repeals some moribund Francoist laws; it also orders the removal of the few remaining symbols of Francoism from public buildings. On the concrete side, it opens up archives and provides for the exhumation of those tossed into anonymous graves by Francoist death squads.
The most surprising thing about the law is not its content but its timing. Franco died in 1975. The civil war, when the worst events took place, ended 68 years ago. Spain is not unique in having a nasty authoritarian past--several central European and Latin American countries have faced the same issues. But many even of those that became democracies later than Spain acted on their history long ago. Among the measures they have used are truth commissions, purges, the opening of archives and trials.
Spain's uniqueness stems from its conscious decision to turn its back on the past. An unwritten agreement known as the ""pact of forgetting"" helped to smooth the rapid transition to democracy after Franco's death. An amnesty ensured that none of his officials was prosecuted. Only a few somewhat tepid measures were taken to deal with the legacy of the past.
The new law shatters the pact of forgetting. This may explain why Mr Zapatero's government has struggled for so long to come up with a text. The opposition People's Party, which he will face at a general election next spring, accuses him of violating the spirit of the democratic transition and awakening the ghosts of Spain's bloody past. What, it asks, about the victims on the other side in the civil war?
Spain's bishops are just as angry. They will gather at the Vatican later this month to beatify 498 victims, mostly priests, monks and nuns, of leftist Republicans during and before the civil war. ""Reconciliation seems under threat,"" intoned the bishops, as the historical memory debate heated up.

FRANCISCO FRANCO, caudillo of Spain, must be turning in his grave. Some 32 years after his death, a Socialist government is pushing through a law to honour the dictator's victims, as well as those of the civil war that brought him to power. Final amendments to the ""historical memory"" law were made by a parliamentary committee on October 17th. After years of deliberations and much angry debate, the law seems likely to be approved on October 31st.
This should be a moment of great personal satisfaction for the prime minister, Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero. The new law was one of his campaign pledges in 2004. His own grandfather, a captain in the Spanish army, was a civil-war victim. He stayed loyal to the Republican government after the 1936 military rebellion and, like thousands of other loyalists captured over the next three years, was shot.
The historical memory law is expressly directed at the victims' descendants. The draft mixes grand symbolic gestures with smaller, concrete measures. On the symbolic front, it repeals some moribund Francoist laws; it also orders the removal of the few remaining symbols of Francoism from public buildings. On the concrete side, it opens up archives and provides for the exhumation of those tossed into anonymous graves by Francoist death squads.
The most surprising thing about the law is not its content but its timing. Franco died in 1975. The civil war, when the worst events took place, ended 68 years ago. Spain is not unique in having a nasty authoritarian past--several central European and Latin American countries have faced the same issues. But many even of those that became democracies later than Spain acted on their history long ago. Among the measures they have used are truth commissions, purges, the opening of archives and trials.
Spain's uniqueness stems from its conscious decision to turn its back on the past. An unwritten agreement known as the ""pact of forgetting"" helped to smooth the rapid transition to democracy after Franco's death. An amnesty ensured that none of his officials was prosecuted. Only a few somewhat tepid measures were taken to deal with the legacy of the past.
The new law shatters the pact of forgetting. This may explain why Mr Zapatero's government has struggled for so long to come up with a text. The opposition People's Party, which he will face at a general election next spring, accuses him of violating the spirit of the democratic transition and awakening the ghosts of Spain's bloody past. What, it asks, about the victims on the other side in the civil war?
Spain's bishops are just as angry. They will gather at the Vatican later this month to beatify 498 victims, mostly priests, monks and nuns, of leftist Republicans during and before the civil war. ""Reconciliation seems under threat,"" intoned the bishops, as the historical memory debate heated up. The draft law tries to head off accusations that it is one-sided by adding those persecuted for religious reasons to its list of victims. Yet even some on the left are unsettled by such tinkering with the past. ""Francoism deprived victims of their lives or freedom, but never of their dignity,"" the normally pro-government El Pais commented. ""It is difficult to restore dignity to those who never lost it.""

TERRORIST attacks are meant to spread confusion. The train bombings that left 191 dead in Madrid on March 11th 2004 certainly did that. They also helped to change the government. Just three days later, Spanish voters unexpectedly elected a Socialist government, with Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero as prime minister. The outgoing People's Party (PP) government, which tried to blame the attacks on the Basque terrorist group, ETA, was dumped.
The confusion has continued to haunt Spanish politics. Internet chatter, speculative journalism and political skulduggery, aided by a police investigation that could not answer all the questions, have combined to produce multiple conspiracy theories. Those theories, returning to the ETA theme or accusing the Socialists of a cover-up, lost most of their credibility this week when a Madrid court sentenced 21 people involved in the attacks. The court also laid out all the known facts about the bombings. ETA was absent. Violent Islamist radicals were to blame. That is good news for Mr Zapatero, who faces an election next March, but bad for the PP, which helped to fan the conspiracy theories.
The trial did not satisfy the victims' families. They wanted longer sentences. The court was unable to tell them who was in charge, or who ordered the attacks. Only three of the accused were convicted of murder. A dozen others were found guilty of belonging to an Islamist terrorist cell. The small number of murder convictions reflected the fact that eight bombers, including the most likely leaders, blew themselves up when they were cornered by police several weeks after the attack.
Most of the guilty group were angry young north African Muslims settled in Spain. They were not openly directed by al-Qaeda, but they were clearly inspired by it. Spain's backing for the Iraq invasion enraged them even more. The other guilty men were small-time crooks who stole, and then sold, the explosives that killed their fellow Spaniards.
Will these verdicts enable most Spaniards to put behind them this most traumatic event in their recent history? Not completely. Conspiracy theorists will keep stirring the pot. Much depends on the PP. In recent months it has avoided the train-bombing subject. With the election approaching, and the court sentences now in, it may leave it alone completely.
The judgment came on a day when Spaniards were also dealing with another highly emotive part of their history. Parliament approved the final version of a historical-memory law, meant to offer moral compensation to victims of Franco's dictatorship. This came hard on the heels of a mass beatification at the Vatican of 498 clerical victims of Franco's left-wing opponents before and during the Spanish civil war in 1936-39. With the bombing trial over and the historical-memory law adopted, two of the country's most bitter political quarrels may now die away.
There are other issues to be discussed. The economy is growing by an expected 3.7%, but that is down on previous quarters and it is likely to slow further. Construction is wilting as house prices start to tumble. Inflation has shot up from 2.7% to a forecast 3.6%. Mr Zapatero, for one, has realised that the political debate has moved on. He has just made a sudden appearance, and issued a rare apology, in Barcelona, where the rail network is in chaos because of attempts to finish a new high-speed rail line on time. With clouds gathering over the economy, Spanish voters may want their politicians to talk about the country's future, not only its past.

IT IS a routine. Every time that Latin American leaders get together at a regional summit, the headlines are stolen by Venezuela's outspoken leftist leader, Hugo Chavez. But at the Ibero-American summit in Chile's capital, Santiago, Mr Chavez got some help from an unusual quarter, Spain's King Juan Carlos.
At the summit's televised closing session on November 10th, Mr Chavez launched a seemingly pre-meditated attack on Jose Maria Aznar, Spain's former prime minister, whom he called a ""fascist"". When Mr Aznar's socialist successor, Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero, demanded respect for an elected leader, Mr Chavez sniped in the background, prompting a clearly infuriated King Juan Carlos to interject, ""Why don't you just shut up?""
That scene, replayed on YouTube, brought delight to countless thousands who have suffered Mr Chavez's chronic verbal diarrhoea. The king later walked out when Nicaragua's president, Daniel Ortega, joined Mr Chavez in attacking privatisation and Spanish businesses.
Spanish officials were keen to prevent the incident from triggering a full-scale diplomatic row. Not so Mr Chavez, who thrives on public verbal spats. This week he stepped up his criticism of Mr Zapatero. He may reckon that this will help to turn a referendum on unpopular constitutional changes into a vote for or against him (see separate story). But he may have picked the wrong target. Spain and its monarch, if not all of its companies, are popular in Latin America.
The theme of the summit was ""social cohesion""--the need for Latin America to use commodity-fuelled economic growth to achieve equality of opportunity. But once again, the divisions among the region's left-of-centre governments were on display. One bitter dispute involves Argentina's environmental objections to a big new paper mill on Uruguay's bank of the river that divides them. The mill started operating during the summit, prompting an Argentine diplomatic protest.
Mr Chavez and Mr Ortega, along with Bolivia's Evo Morales and Cuba's vice-president, Carlos Lage, went on to take part in a poorly attended ""alternative"" summit. There they blamed the United States, the IMF and Europe for poverty in Latin America. Other governments are quietly looking for solutions closer to home.

DESPITE four years of solid economic growth and, in many countries, low inflation, Latin Americans continue to grumble about their democracies. In some countries in the region--though not in Brazil and Mexico, the two giants--they are becoming disillusioned with the market economy. But rather than socialism, they want a fairer distribution of income and a state that gives greater social protection. These are some of the conclusions suggested by the latest Latinobarometro poll taken in 18 countries across the region and published exclusively by The Economist. Because the poll has been taken regularly since 1995, it tracks changes in public attitudes in the region.
The picture that emerges from this year's poll is somewhat contradictory. After a boost last year--probably the result of a dozen presidential elections in the region--support for democracy has fallen back slightly: only around half of respondents are convinced democrats (See Table 1 and Chart 2). In only five countries has support for democracy risen since last year: in Costa Rica and Panama, where popular social-democratic leaders are in office, and in Bolivia, Ecuador and Nicaragua, whose left-wing presidents, respectively Evo Morales, Rafael Correa and Daniel Ortega, represent constituencies who have previously felt excluded from power.
Apart from in two small Central American countries (El Salvador and Honduras), the biggest falls in support for democracy occurred in Argentina and Chile. That is odd, since both countries' economies are growing fast. In Argentina, some democrats may have become disillusioned by dynastic rule: a presidential election last month saw an easy victory for Cristina Fernandez, the wife of the outgoing president, Nestor Kirchner. In Chile, Michelle Bachelet may have failed to meet the expectations of social change that she aroused when elected in 2006.
Fewer than a fifth of respondents favour authoritarian government. Support for authoritarianism has fallen in both Mexico and Brazil to 17%, down respectively from peaks of 35% (in 2001) and 25% (in 2000). In two poor countries, Guatemala and Paraguay, a small majority now favours authoritarianism--nowhere was that the case last year.
Paraguayans and Peruvians are the least satisfied with how their democracy works in practice (see Chart 3). Overall, only 37% of respondents across all 18 countries pronounced themselves satisfied with their democracies, a similar figure to last year. But that is up from 25% in 2001.
Latin Americans are becoming similarly equivocal towards the market economy: this year's poll shows sharp falls of those responding affirmatively when asked whether this is the best economic model for their country (see Chart 4).
Marta Lagos, the director of Latinobarometro, says this reflects not just the persistence of poverty but also the impact of the ""leftist discourse"" of the likes of Hugo Chavez, Venezuela's president, against the United States and against the free-market formulae of the Washington Consensus. She adds that the poll does not show a demand for a fundamental change in the economic system but rather a desire for a more protective state.
Slightly over half of respondents across the region still favour the market economy. Private business is trusted slightly more than government. And support for privatisation continues to recover--though not in Argentina, where Mr Kirchner has preached in favour of nationalisation with a fervour similar to that of Mr Chavez (see Chart 5). But many Latin Americans no longer seem to think that the market alone will bring them a fair share of the fruits of economic growth. Only 41% of respondents across the region think that governments guarantee equality of opportunity.
That is the main message for democratic reformers from the poll. Economic growth and democracy have improved the lives of many Latin Americans. But that in turn seems to have raised their expectations rather than making them more satisfied with the state of their nations. ""After four years of growth people want to see that their slice of the cake is bigger,"" says Ms Lagos.
Thanks to its bounteous oil revenues and Hugo Chavez's rapport with many of his country's poor, Venezuela stands out in the poll. Some 56% of respondents there said that the distribution of wealth in the country was fair, way above the regional average of 24%. Despite this, 63% of Venezuelan respondents said they had difficulties paying their bills each month, well above the regional average of 49%.
The poll finds that Mr Chavez is no more popular in Latin Americas as a whole than George Bush. He is considerably less popular than Brazil's Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva or Spain's king, Juan Carlos, and its prime minister, Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero (with both of whom Mr Chavez crossed words at a recent Ibero-American summit).
The poll shows that governments are steadily becoming more popular and many political institutions a bit less distrusted (see chart 6). One sign of better economic times is that fear of unemployment is falling steadily. For the first time, crime seems about to displace unemployment at the top of the list of problems in the region (see chart 7). If that trend continues, it could eventually see the region's political pendulum start to swing back towards the right after several years in which the left has been in the ascendant.
Latinobarometro is a non-profit organisation based in Santiago, Chile, which has carried out regular surveys of opinions, attitudes and values in Latin America since 1995. The poll was taken by local opinion-research companies in 18 countries and involved 20,212 face-to-face interviews between September 7th and October 8th 2007. The average margin of error was 3%. Central America in chart 4 refers to an unweighted average of results from Costa Rica, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, Nicaragua, and Panama.

Paraguayans and Peruvians are the least satisfied with how their democracy works in practice (see Chart 3). Overall, only 37% of respondents across all 18 countries pronounced themselves satisfied with their democracies, a similar figure to last year. But that is up from 25% in 2001.
Latin Americans are becoming similarly equivocal towards the market economy: this year's poll shows sharp falls of those responding affirmatively when asked whether this is the best economic model for their country (see Chart 4).
Marta Lagos, the director of Latinobarometro, says this reflects not just the persistence of poverty but also the impact of the ""leftist discourse"" of the likes of Hugo Chavez, Venezuela's president, against the United States and against the free-market formulae of the Washington Consensus. She adds that the poll does not show a demand for a fundamental change in the economic system but rather a desire for a more protective state.
Slightly over half of respondents across the region still favour the market economy. Private business is trusted slightly more than government. And support for privatisation continues to recover--though not in Argentina, where Mr Kirchner has preached in favour of nationalisation with a fervour similar to that of Mr Chavez (see Chart 5). But many Latin Americans no longer seem to think that the market alone will bring them a fair share of the fruits of economic growth. Only 41% of respondents across the region think that governments guarantee equality of opportunity.
That is the main message for democratic reformers from the poll. Economic growth and democracy have improved the lives of many Latin Americans. But that in turn seems to have raised their expectations rather than making them more satisfied with the state of their nations. ""After four years of growth people want to see that their slice of the cake is bigger,"" says Ms Lagos.
Thanks to its bounteous oil revenues and Hugo Chavez's rapport with many of his country's poor, Venezuela stands out in the poll. Some 56% of respondents there said that the distribution of wealth in the country was fair, way above the regional average of 24%. Despite this, 63% of Venezuelan respondents said they had difficulties paying their bills each month, well above the regional average of 49%.
The poll finds that Mr Chavez is no more popular in Latin Americas as a whole than George Bush. He is considerably less popular than Brazil's Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva or Spain's king, Juan Carlos, and its prime minister, Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero (with both of whom Mr Chavez crossed words at a recent Ibero-American summit).
The poll shows that governments are steadily becoming more popular and many political institutions a bit less distrusted (see chart 6). One sign of better economic times is that fear of unemployment is falling steadily. For the first time, crime seems about to displace unemployment at the top of the list of problems in the region (see chart 7). If that trend continues, it could eventually see the region's political pendulum start to swing back towards the right after several years in which the left has been in the ascendant.
Latinobarometro is a non-profit organisation based in Santiago, Chile, which has carried out regular surveys of opinions, attitudes and values in Latin America since 1995. The poll was taken by local opinion-research companies in 18 countries and involved 20,212 face-to-face interviews between September 7th and October 8th 2007. The average margin of error was 3%.

IT MUST have turned the bosses of Spain's main political parties green with envy. Less than three months before a general election, more than 150,000 people packed into Madrid for what may turn out to have been the biggest rally held during the campaign, in what looks like an increasingly close electoral race.
Those calling the people onto the streets on December 30th, billed as ""Christian Family Day"", were not professional politicians, but Spain's Catholic bishops. The demonstration added up to an impressive display of strength. As the bishops were quick to point out, the church is Spain's biggest social movement. But they did not limit themselves to spiritual matters. Their words were full of raw politics, and their target was clear. The Socialist prime minister, Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero, they averred, was leading the country towards moral and democratic ruin.
""We are heading towards the end of democracy,"" said one bishop. Spain was ""going backwards"" on human rights, claimed another. The family was under ""serious attack"", said a third. Lay speakers piled on the anti-government rhetoric. ""Don't leave the hearts and minds of your children in the hands of anyone, and especially not of the state,"" said one. But the Socialists have hit back. Some bishops are ""archaic andultra-conservative"", said the party's president, Manuel Chaves. Mr Zapatero said they were trying to sell a false apocalypse.
Conservative Catholics have disliked Mr Zapatero from the moment he won election on March 14th 2004, just three days after Islamist bombers killed 191 people on Madrid trains. The church has noisily opposed laws to make divorce easier, allow gay marriage and take religion out of the obligatory school curriculum. Not that there is there anything new about Spain's left clashing with the Catholic church. Their battles long predate the civil war of the 1930s, when radicals killed more than 6,000 priests, nuns and monks. The church hierarchy at the time backed the nationalist rebel general, Francisco Franco. Some bishops even publicly raised stiff arms in fascist salutes.
This historical confrontation was meant to have ended with the rediscovery of democracy in the 1970s. But church conservatives now seem inspired by America's powerful religious right and by Italy's Roman Catholic bishops, who have never been scared of politics. In Spain, where three-quarters of people define themselves as Roman Catholic but fewer than one-fifth regularly attend church, some bishops clearly believe it is time to convert faith into political clout.
Yet Christian Family Day may have done little to dent Mr Zapatero's chances of winning re-election on March 9th. Indeed, it could help them. Even observant Spaniards are relatively relaxed about their Catholicism. They are not as conservative as Poles or Italians. Some bishops were upset by the tone of the rally. Those willing to endure long coach trips to Madrid for the rally were never likely to vote Socialist. Their natural home is the opposition People's Party (PP), which trails the Socialists by 2.5-4.5 points in most polls.
The Socialists' main electoral problem is to get their supporters into the polling booths. One of the best ways to solve it is to scare them. That is what the 2004 train bombings, with their messy political aftermath and claims by the PP of involvement by the Basque terrorist group, ETA, did. Mr Zapatero won a surprise victory. Some Socialist strategists believe that the sight of a loud political church, bringing with it bad memories of Francoism, may have a similar effect. ""They have lent us a hand,"" claims one Socialist campaign organiser, Antonio Hernando.

THE surprise ingredient in the Spanish election of March 2004 was the Madrid train bombings, which killed 191 commuters just three days before the vote. Thanks to the clumsiness of the outgoing People's Party (PP) government, which tried to blame Basque terrorists, not Islamist radicals, the bombs provoked an unexpected change. What had looked like a PP shoo-in turned into a Socialist bounce-back, handing victory to Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero, now Spain's prime minister.
Four years on, Mr Zapatero is seeking re-election. This time, too, a surprise ingredient has arrived ahead of the March 9th poll. But, despite the recent arrest in Barcelona of 14 Muslim immigrants suspected of planning fresh attacks, it has nothing to do with Islam. After four years in which Spain's politicians have argued bitterly about almost everything else, the new ingredient is the economy.
Few would have predicted this even six months ago. An economy growing at a healthy lick of 3.8% seemed to be one of the strongest of Mr Zapatero's weapons. But since then Spain's housing bubble has burst and inflation has risen. Global financial turmoil now threatens to turn a hoped-for soft landing into something much harder. And the PP, seeking to avenge its 2004 loss, smells blood.
For voters who were not already worried, this week's stockmarket panic was a rude awakening. Few Spaniards are feeling the pain yet, but many expect to. A weekend poll showed three pessimists for every two who are optimistic about the economy, a sharp reversal from July. The political question is whether voters will punish Mr Zapatero for their gnawing sense of uncertainty, or prefer him as the man to lead them through hard times.
His opponents are in no doubt. ""The government thought this was their strong point,"" comments Alvaro Nadal, the PP's employment spokesman. ""The economy had little impact for several years. Now it is very important."" The burst housing bubble is already slowing growth in a country heavily dependent on construction. Unemployment began to rise in 2007 for the first time in four years.
So far, though, nobody is talking of recession. The government predicts 3.1% growth in 2008 (The Economist's consensus forecast is 2.4%). Mr Zapatero claims that the budget surplus has reached a record-breaking 2% of GDP. A surge in the workforce, mainly from immigration, has swollen the coffers of a social-security system that has gained 2.7m more contributors. The government thinks it has a large fighting fund to spend its way out of trouble, if it needs to. ""We must wait and see,"" says the Socialists' chief economist, Inmaculada Rodriguez-Pinero. Even the PP sees room for early tax cuts.
If the polls of voting intentions are at all reliable, Spaniards are slowly but surely drifting away from Mr Zapatero. A Socialist lead of five points in 2004 is down to only two in some polls. It is no surprise to find that many Socialists wish they had fought the election last year, before the world economy wobbled. They have watched in dismay as fast-growing GDP in the past three years has been matched by fast-growing economic pessimism. Indeed, Mr Zapatero has performed a kind of reverse alchemy, transforming economic gold into political lead.
With the economy now weighing so heavily, two unlikely campaign champions have emerged. On one side is the solid, if unglamorous, figure of Pedro Solbes, the finance minister. Mr Zapatero is pushing this former European commissioner as the safe pair of hands that Spain needs. ""He was born to do this,"" he said, when Mr Solbes agreed to stay on after the election.
On the PP side is Manuel Pizarro, best known until recently as a former president of Endesa, an electricity utility. He endured much government meddling in a takeover battle that raged for most of the past four years. Now the party leader, Mariano Rajoy, has hired him. Some say he could be the PP finance minister. Mr Pizarro, a forthright liberal, has the charisma that Mr Solbes lacks. But he is also a political novice. A proposed debate between the two men is being billed as the big event of the campaign. Mr Solbes wants to help his opponent to ""clarify some ideas."" Mr Pizarro retorts: ""Bring them all on.""
Yet the PP has a mountain to climb to get near the Socialists. The opinion polls point to a narrowing gap, but not yet to a PP win. Mr Zapatero has much higher personal ratings than Mr Rajoy, and Mr Solbes is one of his more popular ministers. And the PP has done far too little to woo key voters in the political centre. Mr Rajoy treats global warming as a joke. His party backed the unpopular Iraq war. Social and religious conservatives have become increasingly visible within the party, protesting against Socialist laws to bring in gay marriage and quick divorces or to take religion out of the core school curriculum. Angry debates over the government's attempted peace deal with ETA, the Basque terrorist group, and its granting of more powers to Catalonia have pulled some voters into the PP camp. But the furiously nationalistic tone that the party has employed has put others off.
Nor has the treatment of one leading PP centrist, Alberto Ruiz-Gallardon, a popular mayor of Madrid, helped. Mr Ruiz-Gallardon was kept off the party's list mainly to make room for Mr Pizarro. Some see this as part of the jockeying for the party leadership if Mr Rajoy loses the election and is forced to quit. Mr Rajoy was hand-picked as leader by the previous PP prime minister, Jose Maria Aznar, who stepped down in 2004 because he had pledged to serve no more than two terms in office. Critics say Mr Rajoy lacks the strength of a candidate who has had to fight to the top.
All this, however, may weigh less heavily on voters' minds on March 9th than the economy. Spain is staging what amounts to the rich world's first big post-credit-crunch election.

Some see this as part of the jockeying for the party leadership if Mr Rajoy loses the election and is forced to quit. Mr Rajoy was hand-picked as leader by the previous PP prime minister, Jose Maria Aznar, who stepped down in 2004 because he had pledged to serve no more than two terms in office. Critics say Mr Rajoy lacks the strength of a candidate who has had to fight to the top.
All this, however, may weigh less heavily on voters' minds on March 9th than the economy. Spain is staging what amounts to the rich world's first big post-credit-crunch election.

IT IS fitting that bonanza is a Spanish word, as Spain's voters are experiencing one, in an orgy of tax-cutting promises. Curiously, it coincides with the election on March 9th. The ruling Socialists and their People's Party (PP) opponents, it seems, just cannot give stuff away fast enough.
The prime minister, Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero, kicked off last summer with his ""baby cheques"", worth euro2,500-3,500 ($3,650-5,100) per new-born child. His PP rival, Mariano Rajoy, then pledged to take 7m low earners out of income tax and give working women a special tax cut. The Socialists hit back by scrapping the ""patrimony tax"", a wealth tax on personal assets that is unpopular with middle-class voters; they now promise to take euro400 a year off 13.5m people's income-tax bills.
Each side accuses the other of buying votes. Each offers the same defence, claiming that they are trying to boost the economy as Spain's property bubble bursts, global markets get nervous and unemployment jumps. Both accusations and defences have some validity.
Tax cuts could pump euro 6 billion-16 billion a year into the pockets of taxpayers. That would be a boon, for after ten years in which the economy grew by over 3% a year, growth this year is likely to fall to 2.4% (say the optimists) or even below 2% (the pessimists). Last year's budget surplus was worth over 2% of GDP. Prudent housekeeping, Mr Zapatero asserts, means there is money to spend from the piggy-bank. The PP, meanwhile, likes to hark back to tax cuts when it ran Spain in the late 1990s. Within two years, growth had pushed income-tax receipts up, not down.
Other piggy-banks are also being raided. Spain's social-security system has been boosted by a rise in the workforce, thanks to the arrival of almost 4m immigrants in the past seven years. Both parties want to dip into this pot: Mr Rajoy promises to raise the minimum monthly pension from euro493 to over euro650; Mr Zapatero wants to push it up to euro700.
Voters may be forgiven some confusion, as the electoral bonanza blurs differences between left and right. Tax cuts will stimulate the economy and return resources to citizens, argues the supposedly leftish Mr Zapatero. Increased spending on pensions is just, necessary and possible, says the conservative Mr Rajoy. Some voters may conclude that, whoever wins on March 9th, they cannot lose.
Yet not all will gain. It is hard to restore fiscal prudence after a fit of indulgence. And unemployment is now a big worry, as construction firms and estate agencies fall over themselves to lay off staff. In January state unemployment offices reported a monthly leap in jobless figures of 132,378. Overall unemployment is modest by past standards, at 8.6%. But El Pais says that January's rise was the biggest in three decades. The unemployed will benefit neither from tax cuts nor from pension rises. They can only pray that a cash injection into the economy creates new jobs.
Mr Zapatero, who has a narrow lead of some three points in most opinion polls, is also praying--for no more bad economic news before March 9th. Otherwise he too may be out of a job.",230,Spain,"Spain's parties vie to offer voters ever bigger tax cuts and spending pledges

WHAT exactly is a Spanish custom? Ahead of a close election on March 9th this is suddenly a matter of intense debate. The opposition People's Party (PP) leader, Mariano Rajoy, wants future immigrants to swear to respect Spain's customs. This has provoked jokes about siestas, bull-running and dancing in spotty dresses--three national customs. But it is also a reminder that the election is about more than an economy suffering from high inflation and a burst property bubble.
Mr Rajoy wants immigrants to sign a legally binding ""integration contract"". This would oblige them to learn Spanish, to work hard to integrate--and to return home if they are unemployed for too long or commit a crime. The proposal was ridiculed by Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero, the Socialist prime minister. Spain's foreign-born population has increased fivefold to some 10% in the past seven years, but he claims this has caused few problems.
Mr Rajoy used a television debate with Mr Zapatero this week to accuse him of encouraging an avalanche of immigrants. The Socialists retorted that a xenophobic heart was beating in the PP; the PP said all it wanted to do was to restore order to a chaotic system. Many Socialists seem pleased that Mr Rajoy has chosen to play the immigration card. Mr Zapatero's government has devoted much time to social issues, an area where it feels comfortable. It has legalised gay marriage, made divorce easier, introduced a sex equality law and weakened the Catholic Church's influence over education. Most of these measures have proved popular; PP opposition has allowed the Socialists to preen themselves as a nice party fighting reaction.
A few months ago, however, the PP switched the thrust of its drive to win back the power it lost in 2004. With growth slowing, unemployment rising and inflation hitting 4.3%, it began to focus more on the government's economic competence. Mr Rajoy signed up Manuel Pizarro, a businessman who was formerly deputy chairman of the Madrid stock exchange, for his team (though he suffered a bruising defeat in a televised debate with the finance minister, Pedro Solbes).
Mr Rajoy's immigration plans have given the Socialists a chance to divert the debate away from the economy and claim once again to be more positive, caring and tolerant, painting the PP as a jumble of angry negatives. The interior minister, Alfredo Perez Rubalcaba, asserted that, after months behind a moderate mask, Mr Rajoy had at last revealed himself as ""authoritarian and anti-social"".
The voters may yet come to a different conclusion. A pre-debate poll in El Pais showed that 56% liked Mr Rajoy's immigration contract. The PP is aiming at working-class voters the Socialists usually rely on. They are often the first to worry about the impact of immigration on their neighbourhoods and local schools, as well as the first to lose their jobs in an economic slowdown. Mr Rajoy wants these voters either to switch allegiance or just to stay at home. Then Mr Zapatero may find that seeming nice is not enough.

ANYBODY who is confident of the outcome of Spain's election on March 9th should recall March 14th 2004. Three days after Islamist terrorists bombed four Madrid trains, killing 191 people, voters unexpectedly handed victory to the Socialists' Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero. This weekend Mr Zapatero faces the electorate once again. Sober flags showing Mr Zapatero and his People's Party (PP) rival, Mariano Rajoy, flutter decorously along the two sides of Madrid's Castellana avenue, belying the bitter tensions between the two parties that have persisted since 2004. Opinion polls suggest Mr Zapatero will win--but the margin may be narrow.
On the face of it, that seems odd. The past four years have been good for Spain. Growth has averaged almost 4%. Spain has been producing most of the jobs created in the euro area. In December Europe's number-crunchers said it had overtaken Italy in GDP per head. Mr Zapatero's decision to pull Spanish troops out of Iraq was popular, as were most of his government's social policies, such as legalising gay marriages. Spanish governments tend to be re-elected at least once, and the country is naturally left-of-centre. Yet Mr Zapatero does not appear to be reaping the rewards.
His PP and Socialist predecessors as prime minister, respectively Jose Maria Aznar and Felipe Gonzalez, both won absolute majorities in their second terms. Even Mr Zapatero's closest backers consider that unlikely this time. Much will depend on turnout--anything above 70% will boost him. Yet, as one ally concedes, if he fails to win an absolute majority, that will be a mark of Mr Zapatero's failure as leader. One problem is his lack of inspiration and punchiness. But the colourless Mr Rajoy is little better. The consensus is that Mr Zapatero held his own in the first televised debates between the two men, and won the second.
Mr Zapatero's struggle to win re-election seems to be attributable to three broader factors. The first and biggest is, surprisingly, the economy, now a matter of deep concern for many Spaniards. GDP growth is slowing sharply, from 3.8% in 2007 to 3% (officially) or even as little as 2% (say pessimists) this year. Unemployment jumped in both January and February. Consumer confidence is at a 13-year low. And inflation has ticked up above 4%.
Plainly, the economy's apparently robust performance was more fragile than it seemed. It has depended heavily on construction, which accounts for as much as 18% of GDP, nearly twice the share in other European countries. In recent years Spain has built more new houses than Britain, France and Germany put together. Now the property bubble has burst. In November new house-building requests fell by a quarter over a year earlier, says the Bank of Spain. House prices are dropping. No wonder voters feel glum.
The second factor weakening Mr Zapatero is his policy on the Spanish regions. It was risky to devolve more powers to the Catalans, and even more so to talk to the Basque separatists, ETA. Mr Aznar's refusal to discuss more regional autonomy had stoked separatist sentiment. Yet the new statute for Catalonia, fiercely resisted by the PP and now subject to a court challenge, has proved unpopular in the rest of Spain. It has not even helped the Socialists much in Catalonia--indeed, the regional parties will do well, putting them in a strong bargaining position with a new government (see box on next page).
As for ETA, its decision to end a two-year ceasefire and resume its campaign of violence was a blow to Mr Zapatero, making him seem credulous and naive. It is true that the PP government also talked to ETA, and that thanks to good police work the terrorists are even weaker than they were. But Mr Zapatero's new regionalism has certainly not helped him.
The third issue that may have hurt him is immigration. Spain has become Europe's migration magnet: in the past decade it has taken in as many as 5m foreigners, second only to the United States. Most come from north Africa and Latin America. The population, once expected to fall, is growing fast: official forecasts show it rising from 45m now to almost 50m by 2015. Mr Rajoy has made much of uncontrolled immigration, with the avowed goal of luring native working-class voters away from the Socialists.
Mr Zapatero stoutly defends immigration, especially his decision to legalise many of those who entered Spain illegally. Yet the country is now changing so fast as to test social tolerance. In 2000 the foreign-born share of the population was just 4%. Seven years on, it is 12%, as high as anywhere in Europe. With the economy in trouble and unemployment rising, a backlash against immigration seems likely.
Immigration is intimately linked to Spain's economic performance. Many foreigners arrived to work in construction. They are also responsible for much demand for new housing outside the costas. And immigrants have been crucial in bringing about wage moderation--real wages have recently been falling--and in holding down inflation. One economist, tongue only just in cheek, calls immigration a de facto labour-market reform.
Immigration has also made two failings in the Spanish economy potentially worse. First, it has prolonged the property boom to the point where its bursting seems bound to cause more pain. The Bank of Spain insists that Spanish banks are healthier than their rivals, not least because it wisely kept them out of the fancy structured-finance products that have caused such trouble elsewhere. But it concedes that lending linked to property has risen from 40% of all loans in 2005 to 60% now. It puts total exposure to property at a whopping euro300 billion ($450 billion).
The government insists it is well placed to respond to a slowing economy. The budget surplus is running at 2% of GDP; ten years ago the deficit was close to 3.4%. Mr Zapatero and Mr Rajoy are vying to make ever more extravagant promises of tax cuts and spending plans. But the Bank of Spain urges caution: inflation is high and the current-account deficit is a shocking 9% of GDP, so fiscal expansion may be riskier than it appears at first sight.
This should focus the attention on the second failing: Spain's lack of structural reforms to improve competitiveness, free up the labour market, liberalise the economy and start the slog of raising productivity by such measures as improving education. The good times of the past decade, plus European Union money that is now running out, allowed governments of both parties to put off taking unpalatable medicine. Spain faces its severest test since joining the euro a decade ago. The only way to pass is to make deeper reforms than either party has so far suggested.

Malaysia's ruling National Front suffered its biggest electoral setback since independence in 1957. Though the coalition returned to power, it lost the two-thirds majority in Parliament it has enjoyed since 1969 and held onto only eight of Malaysia's 13 state governments. In one state, Penang, the opposition said it would no longer follow the New Economic Policy that discriminates in favour of the country's ethnic Malays.
In Pakistan, Asif Zardari, leader of the Pakistan People's Party, signed a power-sharing agreement with Nawaz Sharif of the Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz. Both parties agreed to rule in co-operation at the federal level and in Punjab, the country's richest province. Meanwhile, at least 24 people were killed in two suicide-bomb attacks in Lahore. One attack occurred at the entrance to the offices of the Federal Investigation Agency.
Tibetans began demonstrations on the anniversary of an uprising against Chinese rule. Chinese police dispersed monks marching in Lhasa, using tear-gas, and India ordered Tibetans to stop a march from their home in exile, Dharamsala, towards the border.
Hong Kong closed all its kindergartens and junior schools after the outbreak of an unidentified flu-like illness, which has killed four children and affected 200 others.
As expected, China announced the creation of five ""super-ministries"" to streamline decision-making. This entails a new ministry for the environment, but not an energy ministry, the subject of bureaucratic opposition.

Malaysia's ruling National Front suffered its biggest electoral setback since independence in 1957. Though the coalition returned to power, it lost the two-thirds majority in Parliament it has enjoyed since 1969 and held onto only eight of Malaysia's 13 state governments. In one state, Penang, the opposition said it would no longer follow the New Economic Policy that discriminates in favour of the country's ethnic Malays.
In Pakistan, Asif Zardari, leader of the Pakistan People's Party, signed a power-sharing agreement with Nawaz Sharif of the Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz.

One attack occurred at the entrance to the offices of the Federal Investigation Agency.

NO LONGER is Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero the accidental prime minister. In March 2004, luck helped to bring the leader of Spain's Socialists to power: he was trailing in the polls until a cack-handed attempt by the ruling centre-right People's Party to blame the Madrid train bombings three days before the election on Basque separatists. This time he consistently led his PP rival, Mariano Rajoy, and duly won re-election on March 9th. Yet his second term promises to be far harder than his first.
For one thing, the Socialists again fell short of an absolute majority in parliament, so Mr Zapatero will need a regional party's backing (see page 50). His best bet is to dump the left-wing Catalan separatists in favour of their moderate rivals, Convergence and Union (CiU). The CiU may well demand still more autonomy for Catalonia, but it is broadly liberal on economic policy. This matters, for the economy will be Mr Zapatero's biggest headache.
Spain has been one of the European Union's biggest success stories. Thanks to the macroeconomic stability afforded by the euro, lavish EU subsidies, a property boom and a huge influx of immigrant workers, the economy has grown by some 4% a year. Over the past four years, Spain has created two-thirds of all new jobs in the euro area's biggest four countries. But the good times have come to an abrupt end. GDP growth has slowed sharply, unemployment has shot up, house prices are falling and inflation has risen. EU money is running out and immigration will follow the economy down. Consumer confidence is at a 13-year low.
Spain's vote was the first post-credit-crunch election in a big Western country. Economic woes did indeed cost Mr Zapatero some support. Yet he persuaded many voters that the slowdown was not really his fault; and that the sensible choice in such risky times was his reliable finance minister, Pedro Solbes. The PP failed to come up with a convincing cure for the ailing economy. Mr Solbes presides over a healthy budget surplus worth 2% of GDP, giving him plenty of room for tax cuts and a splurge of public spending on infrastructure.
Yet fiscal expansion will not be enough, for the end of the good times is exposing deeper weaknesses. Successive Spanish governments worked strenuously to get the country into the euro, then sat back, accepting the benefits in lower inflation and interest rates, but failing to promote the more competitive markets that the discipline of euro membership requires. Spanish labour laws are too restrictive. Rising costs are denting the competitiveness of manufacturing, which makes up a big chunk of the economy. Productivity is held back by poor education and training. Immigration and the property bubble made up for these failings for a while, but no longer.
In search of bipartisanship
Economic liberalisation is hard, as many other European governments have found, because reforms tend to be fiercely opposed by unions and other vested interests. That makes it desirable to seek bipartisan support for the more controversial ones, such as labour-law changes. In the past four years, Spanish politics has been characterised by a rancorous bitterness. But Mr Rajoy's concession speech was dignified, and Mr Zapatero wisely responded with a promise to work ""without tension, without confrontation"".
Defusing Spain's regional tensions also demands a new bipartisanship. Here Mr Zapatero threw caution to the winds in his first term, drawing up a new statute for the Catalans and negotiating with ETA, the violent Basque separatist group, in the teeth of PP opposition. Yet the Catalans always seem to demand more concessions, and other regions tend to copy them. The talks with ETA failed (the terrorists seem to have been responsible for the killing of a retired Socialist councillor in the Basque country two days before the election).

AT FIRST sight, the election in Spain on March 9th changed little. Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero led his Socialists to a slightly bigger win than in March 2004. His party has a 16-seat lead over its main opponent, the centre-right People's Party (PP), in the 350-seat parliament--the same as before. Mr Zapatero will be prime minister for another four years. The PP leader, Mariano Rajoy, has lost two elections running and yet he plans to stay on. Neither proposes big changes to party policy. Is Spain due to repeat the past four years?
The answer is no. Mr Zapatero's re-election comes in different circumstances. His 2004 victory was linked to the Islamist train bombings that had rocked Madrid three days earlier, killing 191 people. It was a vote of no-confidence in an outgoing PP government that tried to blame the massacre on the Basque separatists, ETA.
This time ETA did carry out an attack before the election. A former Socialist councillor in the Basque town of Mondragon, Isaias Carrasco, was shot as he left for work. His wife and daughter found him bleeding to death on the ground. The killing may have pushed more voters into the polling booths, but it does not explain Mr Zapatero's victory. Spaniards simply decided that he was the best man to take them through difficult economic times.
Mr Rajoy led his party to defeat but raised its share of the vote and its number of deputies. He plans to stand for re-election as party leader in June. A victory would allow him to sack unpopular members of the team inherited from his predecessor, Jose Maria Aznar. He will not, however, change his party's policies. ""If I change the message, I'll change party,"" he promised after daring other party heavyweights to challenge him.
Spain's regional, separatist and far-left parties all suffered in the election. In all, they lost a quarter of their support, with the most left-wing and separatist parties doing worst. That let both the Socialists and the PP pick up a handful of new seats. Yet Mr Zapatero is still seven seats short of an absolute majority and must seek the support of other parties.
He has two regional options: the Basque Nationalist Party or Catalonia's Convergence and Union (CiU). Otherwise he may opt for smaller parties based around two supporters in the previous parliament, United Left and the separatist Catalan Republican Left (ERC). These two parties lost eight of their 13 seats. A long-term pact may not be needed: previously, Mr Zapatero negotiated support for each measure presented to parliament, including annual budgets. He could do so again.
The biggest change over the next four years will be in the issues politicians argue over. Spain's long economic boom faltered in the run-up to the election. Structural reforms to deal with the weaknesses of an economy heavily dependent on a building boom and cheap immigrant labour were not made. Spain's bitterly divisive internal politics, based on partisan rows over devolving power to the regions, dealing with ETA, funding the Catholic church or introducing social reforms, have dominated all debate. Mr Zapatero's negotiations with ETA failed. He is unlikely to try again. He gave Catalonia a new charter, parts of which might yet be struck down by the constitutional court. But unless his putative CiU allies demand even more, the matter is settled for now.
The real concern is the economy. Inflation is running at 4.3%. Growth is predicted to drop from 3.5% to 2.4% or less this year. It may well fall again in 2009. Several property and construction companies are in trouble as the housing market grinds to a halt. Some 60% of bank loans are property-related. Unemployment is rising fast. The finance minister, Pedro Solbes, who will stay in his job, hopes that a euro400 ($620) annual income-tax rebate will be approved soon. Increased public spending on infrastructure projects is also likely.
Decisions on the economy will depend on where Mr Zapatero turns for support. Some parties, like CiU, favour liberal measures such as cuts in corporate tax. United Left and the ERC do not. ""The biggest challenge for the economy is to increase productivity,"" says Mr Solbes. It is time, in short, to get serious about reform.

AT THE World Economic Forum in Davos in January 2001, the mood was sombre. The dotcom bubble had burst spectacularly, the Nasdaq stockmarket had crashed, and the American economy was tipping into recession. Yet most continental Europeans were breezily optimistic. The long years of being lectured about their inadequacies by the Anglo-Saxons were over. Europe had wisely skipped the dotcom mania, and its new currency, the euro, was giving the continent a boost. Some Europeans even dreamed of taking over as the motor of the world economy. But it was not to be, as Europe promptly fell into a deeper recession even than America. 
Seven years on, the parallels are uncanny. Continental Europe has sensibly avoided America's subprime follies, it is argued. Its banks are in better shape, average euro-area unemployment of 7.1% is the lowest in almost 20 years, the euro is resurgent and, as Joaquin Almunia, the engaging European economics commissioner, insists, there is no sign of a recession. The commission will trim its forecasts later this month, but euro-area growth is likely to stay close to 2% this year. It is true that the European Central Bank (ECB) in Frankfurt has, like America's Federal Reserve, flooded the financial system with liquidity in response to the credit crunch. But unlike the Fed, it has not so far felt the need to bring down interest rates. 
Just as in 2001, however, the outlook for the euro area seems to be deteriorating a lot faster than the optimists had expected. After all, the main reason that the ECB has been reluctant to cut rates is not because growth is so robust but because inflation has picked up to 3.5%--the highest in the euro's nine-year existence. Troubles in the region's two biggest export markets--recession in America and slowdown in Britain--are starting to bite. Exports to Asia have been strong, especially from Germany, but in most countries nervous consumers remain reluctant to spend. 
And two bigger worries have emerged. The first is the strength of the euro. A weaker dollar is driving an American export boom; a stronger euro is likely to have the opposite effect in Europe. Mr Almunia says the euro is ""overvalued"" and adds that, although the impact has been moderate so far, ""we are at the limits, if not beyond them."" It is a delusion to suppose that euro-area exports can continue to barrel on regardless of their cost.
The second worry is the housing market. Europe may have avoided the American subprime mess, but in several countries house prices have been even bubblier than in America. They are already falling in Spain and Ireland, and, beyond the euro zone, are starting to do so in Britain. A property bust may not produce an American-style mortgage meltdown, but it will surely topple economies heavily dependent on construction (which accounts for 15% or more of Spanish and Irish GDP, for example).
Indeed, Mr Almunia's home country of Spain appears especially vulnerable. He maintains that Anglo-Saxon commentators are excessively pessimistic about Spain's prospects. But the signs of a sharp slowdown are clear even to the re-elected prime minister, Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero, who has announced a fiscal stimulus to help Spain weather the ""turbulence"". Given that Spain has in recent years accounted for a big chunk of euro-zone growth and close to half of all jobs created in the euro area, its slowdown will be widely felt. And not just in economics. It will be a lot harder to sell the EU's ambitious plans to cut CO{-2} emissions in a faltering economy, for instance.
The political fallout will be felt in other ways too, because of the differential performance of euro-area economies. Mr Almunia admits that France and Italy are a lot weaker than Germany; soon enough, French and Italian leaders (especially if Silvio Berlusconi wins Italy's imminent election) will squeal ever more loudly about the euro's strength, the ECB's rigid monetary policy and, quite possibly, will demand that their industries be protected from ""unfair"" competition. Such pressure will be resisted by the Germans, who remain comfortable with the euro's strength and always hate criticism of the ECB. 
The dark face of success
Even critics of the euro would concede that it has had considerable success, establishing itself in less than a decade as a genuine rival to the dollar as a world currency. But that success disguises two failings. The first is that some countries have adapted a lot better to the discipline of the euro than others. Germany and the Netherlands have cut labour costs and introduced enough reforms to make their economies more competitive. France, Spain and especially Italy have done less--and are suffering more, from both the euro's rise and the global slowdown.
The second failing is an ironic flipside of success. To qualify for the euro in the late 1990s, countries such as Italy and Spain had to make swingeing fiscal and structural adjustments. Yet by shielding weaker countries from a currency crisis, the euro now relieves much of the pressure on them to keep up reforms. In fact, these are more essential than ever now that countries have lost the option of devaluing their currencies to regain competitiveness and offset relatively slow productivity growth. As Mr Almunia sadly concedes, it has proved impossible ""to compensate for the lack of market incentives for reform through policy co-ordination and peer pressure"". 
In truth, as the euro approaches its tenth birthday celebrations, it is facing the biggest test of its short life. If Europe follows America into recession, which is quite possible, the pain will be a lot greater in the Mediterranean countries than in Germany and northern Europe. Not surprisingly, the political response from the two regions will also be quite different. Even as it prepares to expand once more to take in Slovakia and later other countries from eastern Europe, the euro is about to show the world that it is not yet an optimal currency area--and the demonstration may not be a pretty one.",230,Spain,"Euro-zone economies face external woes and internal tensions

Mr Almunia says the euro is ""overvalued"" and adds that, although the impact has been moderate so far, ""we are at the limits, if not beyond them."" It is a delusion to suppose that euro-area exports can continue to barrel on regardless of their cost.
The second worry is the housing market. Europe may have avoided the American subprime mess, but in several countries house prices have been even bubblier than in America. They are already falling in Spain and Ireland, and, beyond the euro zone, are starting to do so in Britain. A property bust may not produce an American-style mortgage meltdown, but it will surely topple economies heavily dependent on construction (which accounts for 15% or more of Spanish and Irish GDP, for example).
Indeed, Mr Almunia's home country of Spain appears especially vulnerable. He maintains that Anglo-Saxon commentators are excessively pessimistic about Spain's prospects. But the signs of a sharp slowdown are clear even to the re-elected prime minister, Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero, who has announced a fiscal stimulus to help Spain weather the ""turbulence"". Given that Spain has in recent years accounted for a big chunk of euro-zone growth and close to half of all jobs created in the euro area, its slowdown will be widely felt. And not just in economics. It will be a lot harder to sell the EU's ambitious plans to cut CO{-2} emissions in a faltering economy, for instance.
The political fallout will be felt in other ways too, because of the differential performance of euro-area economies. Mr Almunia admits that France and Italy are a lot weaker than Germany; soon enough, French and Italian leaders (especially if Silvio Berlusconi wins Italy's imminent election) will squeal ever more loudly about the euro's strength, the ECB's rigid monetary policy and, quite possibly, will demand that their industries be protected from ""unfair"" competition. Such pressure will be resisted by the Germans, who remain comfortable with the euro's strength and always hate criticism of the ECB. 
The dark face of success
Even critics of the euro would concede that it has had considerable success, establishing itself in less than a decade as a genuine rival to the dollar as a world currency. But that success disguises two failings. The first is that some countries have adapted a lot better to the discipline of the euro than others. Germany and the Netherlands have cut labour costs and introduced enough reforms to make their economies more competitive. France, Spain and especially Italy have done less--and are suffering more, from both the euro's rise and the global slowdown.
The second failing is an ironic flipside of success. To qualify for the euro in the late 1990s, countries such as Italy and Spain had to make swingeing fiscal and structural adjustments. Yet by shielding weaker countries from a currency crisis, the euro now relieves much of the pressure on them to keep up reforms. In fact, these are more essential than ever now that countries have lost the option of devaluing their currencies to regain competitiveness and offset relatively slow productivity growth. As Mr Almunia sadly concedes, it has proved impossible ""to compensate for the lack of market incentives for reform through policy co-ordination and peer pressure"". 
In truth, as the euro approaches its tenth birthday celebrations, it is facing the biggest test of its short life. If Europe follows America into recession, which is quite possible, the pain will be a lot greater in the Mediterranean countries than in Germany and northern Europe. Not surprisingly, the political response from the two regions will also be quite different. Even as it prepares to expand once more to take in Slovakia and later other countries from eastern Europe, the euro is about to show the world that it is not yet an optimal currency area--and the demonstration may not be a pretty one.",True

THE higher they climb, the harder they fall. Spain, one of Europe's economic star performers for more than a decade, is tumbling from its pedestal just as Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero, the Socialist prime minister, begins his second term.
Mr Zapatero has burnished his credentials as a social reformer, with a fresh cabinet dominated by women, including the new defence minister, Carme Chancon. But the need for economic reforms is becoming ever more urgent.
The global credit crunch has come with an extra twist in Spain, where it coincides with the bursting of the housing bubble. An expected soft landing has suddenly become hard and painful. Underlying (and untended) economic weaknesses that were hidden by the construction boom are being painfully exposed, among them low productivity growth.
Things have become considerably worse since the March 9th elections. The IMF estimates that last year's growth of 3.8% will fall to 1.8% this year, and get worse in 2009. These would be the slowest growth levels in Spain since 1993. 
House prices are predicted to fall by up to 15% over three years. Negative equity threatens some home-owners. But as a member of the euro zone, Spain has no control over interest rates or the value of the currency. Builders are struggling to find buyers for homes and, worse, cannot borrow to get through hard times. Some have already gone bankrupt. The construction sector--which accounts for 60% of all bank loans--is set to shed some 400,000 jobs over the next two years. 
The most worrying factor, however, is the disappearing budget surplus. Before the elections, Mr Zapatero boasted that he had ample funds to respond to the downturn. Last year's surplus was a healthy 2.2% of GDP, or euro23 billion ($36 billion). ""The comfortable state of public finances provides margin for manoeuvre,"" says the veteran finance minister, Pedro Solbes. A report from the BBVA bank, however, suggests the surplus will turn to deficit next year. Receipts from value added tax have already dropped in the first two months of 2008. 
Nevertheless, at the first cabinet meeting of the new government due to be held on April 18th, ministers were expected to approve a fiscal stimulus worth euro10 billion ($16 billion), including a euro400 annual rebate to every taxpayer (worth euro6 billion) and several other measures, such as infrastructure and public-housing contracts. 
Fiscal expansion may not be enough, however. A strengthening euro will hinder export-led growth. Productivity and competitiveness remain Spain's greatest challenges. These need reforms to the labour market, the education system and Spain's research and development infrastructure that may take years to produce results. 
Mr Zapatero is lucky, for the moment at least. The opposition People's Party is immersed in internal squabbling, and is waiting to see whether its leader, Mariano Rajoy, who has lost two consecutive elections, will face a challenge from Madrid's ambitious regional premier, Esperanza Aguirre, at its convention in June.
The prime minister is fortunate, too, in that he went to the polls before the worst of the economic news emerged. His minority government is just seven seats short of a parliamentary majority, although it should get support from Catalan or Basque regional parties.

THE energy map of Europe seems likely to be redrawn again this summer. At the centre of all the manoeuvres is France's EDF, the biggest European energy group by stockmarket value, and Europe's leading nuclear generator--a great advantage in an industry facing future constraints on carbon-dioxide emissions. EDF's size and financial strength is all the greater because, with 85% of its shares held by the French government, it is immune to takeover. So it is free to flex its muscles all over the continent. Having been frustrated in the recent past in Italy, EDF has turned its attention to Spain and Britain to bolster its already dominant position. 
On April 9th Spain's prime minister, Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero, said he wanted two Spanish firms, Iberdrola and Gas Natural, to merge and then protect themselves with a solid block of loyal shareholders in order to fend off EDF, which has Iberdrola in its sights. Iberdrola, which is attractive because it is the world leader in wind-power generation, appealed to EDF on April 15th to ""put up or shut up"", and has sought help from the Spanish courts to block any French bid. For its part, EDF has been trying to enlist ACS, a Spanish construction group, to give its bid a more local flavour. 
In Britain, meanwhile, EDF is just one of a crowd of suitors for British Energy, which owns eight nuclear-power stations (and one coal-fired plant) that produce around one-sixth of Britain's electricity. It has been in play since last month, when the British government said it wanted to sell its 35.2% stake. Potential buyers include EDF, Germany's RWE (both already present in the British market) and Centrica, a British firm that owns gas fields, power stations and an energy-retail business. Bids may also come from Scottish and Southern (another British firm), Sweden's Vattenfall and Iberdrola itself. RWE and EDF are each thought to have made opening bids of around pounds 11 billion ($22 billion).
The government is likely to encourage a consortium of bidders for British Energy, to avoid putting too much of its nuclear-energy production into the hands of one foreign firm. Centrica, for instance, has no nuclear expertise but a big British client base, so it would make sense for the company to team up with an experienced nuclear operator such as RWE or EDF.
Bidders are less interested in British Energy's ageing existing plants than in potential new ones. The government wants more nuclear plants because it is worried about climate change and energy security, and domestic oil and gas production is in decline. British Energy does not have the funds to invest in new nuclear plants, which cost around pounds 2 billion each, but cash-rich foreign energy giants do.
Any new reactors are most likely to be built on British Energy's existing sites, says Andrew Moulder, an analyst at CreditSights, a research company. Such sites have the advantages that locals have come to accept nuclear plants, trained staff are available and grid connections already exist. The Nuclear Decommissioning Authority (NDA) also has some sites that could be redeveloped, but they are smaller. The trouble is that the government has not said whether it will allow new nuclear plants to be built on sites other than those belonging to British Energy--and there is speculation that it may grant one or more of them to the NDA, which would reduce British Energy's appeal.
If the government is prepared to allow other new plants to be built elsewhere, foreign energy firms might be better off applying for planning permission for new sites rather than paying a hefty price for British Energy. The firm's debt is rated as ""junk"" because of its financial woes and poor operational record. 
Britain's new nuclear programme will be an experiment. Previous nuclear plants were built with government backing or with guaranteed revenue from regulated electricity prices. The British government wants the developer of the new plants to take the electricity-price risk and will not provide any subsidy. Considering the uncertainty over what is on offer, and the financial risks involved, potential bidders for British Energy are wisely keeping their cards close to their chests.

THE sight of Spain's heavily pregnant defence minister inspecting the troops in early April seemed to herald a new era of opportunity for Spanish women. Spain is the first European country ever to produce a government with more female than male ministers. Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero, the prime minister, has appointed nine women and eight men to his new cabinet, including Carme Chacon, Spain's first female defence minister. 
Despite their sudden ascendancy in politics, however, women are still practically absent from the upper ranks of business. Spanish women make up just 4.1% of corporate boards, according to a study by the European Professional Women's Network, an lobby group, and Egon Zehnder, a recruiting agency, against an 11% average in Europe (see chart).
One reason is that fewer women make it into the workforce than in other European countries, with the exception of Italy. The gap between male and female employment rates in Spain is over 20% points, according to a study by Kevin Daly at Goldman Sachs, an investment bank. Reconciling family life with work, a struggle anywhere, seems to be harder in Spain than in other countries. Spanish women spend far more time on domestic chores, including childcare, than men. The length of the working day, which is extended into the evening thanks to long lunch breaks, does not help. It is practically impossible to juggle family and work if you get home at 9pm or 10pm, says Ruth Mateos de Cabo, one of the authors of an academic paper entitled ""Discrimination on Spanish Boards of Directors"". 
Ms Mateos and her co-authors analysed the boards of Spain's top 1,000 companies in a bid to understand why women are so scarce. They found that Spanish boardrooms are clubby, and that diversity is seen as a hindrance, not a strength. 
The government has passed a law that aims to change things by requiring firms to raise the share of women on boards to 40% by 2015. Norway already has such a quota, but the results have been mixed: because of a shortage of eligible women, some of the most qualified have collected as many as 35 directorships. 
In Spain the target is mainly symbolic, since companies will not face financial penalties if they do not meet it, unlike their Norwegian counterparts, although the government may take their performance into account when awarding public contracts. It may be better to help women gain enough experience to be good candidates for directorships to begin with. Encouraging more reasonable hours would be a start. Spanish boards may also consider head-hunting in fields where women are better represented, such as academia.
There are reasons for optimism. A bigger share of women in their 20s are joining the workforce in Spain than in America. Eva Castillo, a banker and board-member of Telefonica, a telecoms firm, believes it is only a matter of time before women's lot at Spanish firms improves: ""It's changing naturally, it's a generational thing.""",230,Spain,"Spain's government wants firms to appoint more female directors

IF LIFE can be lonely in politics, there may be few people as lonely as the leader of Spain's People's Party (PP).

His presence, he believed, would stop the PP engaging in self-destructive internal warfare. Next month he will stand for re-election. With nobody yet daring to oppose the man who controls the party machine, he should be a shoo-in.
Yet the fight he wanted to avoid has already broken out. Two former ministers, Angel Acebes and Eduardo Zaplana, have abandoned him. The ambitious leader of Madrid's regional government, Esperanza Aguirre, is leaving open the possibility of challenging him. And now Maria San Gil, the popular PP boss in the Basque country, has rebelled, talking of ""fundamental differences"" with Mr Rajoy's new team.
Behind the scenes, a fierce ideological battle is being fought. Like Ms Aguirre, Ms San Gil thinks that Mr Rajoy is going soft. She frets that he wants to be nice to Basque and Catalan nationalists. She represents a wing of the PP that believes nationalists are intent on ripping Spain into separate countries. She accuses the Basque nationalists of moral cowardice towards ETA terrorists (who this week killed a policeman in a car-bomb attack). Her credentials as one who makes sacrifices for her party are second to none. In 1995 her colleague, Gregorio Ordonez, was shot dead by an ETA terrorist in front of her in a restaurant.
A battalion of PP members has lined up behind Ms San Gil. They include Ana Botella, the normally discreet wife of Mr Rajoy's predecessor, Jose Maria Aznar, who is a senior member of Madrid's city government. ""Maria San Gil is a moral, political and emotional reference point,"" she said pointedly. 
Mr Rajoy wants to push the PP to the centre. With no rival on the right, that seems sensible. In Spain, however, moving to the centre is not just a question of easing up on liberal economic policy. It also means softening the party's rabid opposition to further regional devolution.
Mr Zapatero's victory in March was due, in part, to Catalans and Basques who were scared into voting Socialist by the PP's aggressive centralism. Even if Mr Rajoy had won the election, the chances are that he, like Mr Zapatero, would have needed support from the nationalist parties in order to govern. 
Yet PP hardliners may prefer ideology to electability. Ms San Gil is one of the few who could mount a credible challenge to Mr Rajoy. Young, charismatic and courageous, she would be a serious test for a man whose biggest weakness is that he was hand-picked by Mr Aznar as his successor and has never faced an internal challenge. Her biggest handicap is that (like Ms Aguirre) she does not have a seat in parliament. But her support for another challenger could prove decisive. The choice would then be between a new leader and new policies. The trouble is that the PP probably needs both.

SUCCESSES in soccer and politics do not always go together. Even as euphoric Spaniards revel in their team's Euro 2008 win on June 29th, they know that the real party, celebrating a decade of fizzy growth, is over. The Socialist prime minister, Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero, would prefer them to focus on sport, not the economy. But even though he was elected to a second term in March, his popularity is now tumbling, in line with the economy.
The litany of bad news has become interminable. Growth is slowing sharply and unemployment is rising. The housing bubble has burst and residential construction has seized up. Prices of petrol, electricity, food and a host of other things Spaniards buy have all gone up sharply, as (on July 3rd) did euro-area interest rates.
It is no surprise that half of all Spaniards now consider their personal financial position to be worse than in March. This may not be all Mr Zapatero's fault, but he is the man they are blaming. Striking truck-drivers caused chaos on the roads and left supermarket shelves empty for a week in June. The four-point lead that the Socialists had over the People's Party (PP) opposition in March has now evaporated.
It does not help that the government keeps denying that it faces a crisis. The finance minister, Pedro Solbes, refuses to utter the word ""crisis"" at all. Mr Zapatero told the daily El Pais that its use was ""a matter of opinion"". They are supported by Banco Santander's president, Emilio Botin, who compares the fraught state of the economy with a child's fever: dramatic, but short-lived. Yet crisis may be too bland a word: many economists think ""recession"" will soon be more appropriate. Mr Solbes admits that second-quarter growth will be below the first quarter's paltry 0.3%. His prediction of 2008 growth is now somewhere ""below"" 2%. On July 2nd a defiant Mr Zapatero told parliament he did not believe recession was coming.
In his first term, a smiling Mr Zapatero rode the crest of the economic wave, with a feel-good image of optimism and positive thinking. From regional devolution to gay marriage, he spread a message of goodwill to all. The economy was given little attention as it turned in growth rates well above 3% every year. Cures for every social or political ill seemed possible, as there was plenty of money around.
Things started to go wrong when Spain's frothy construction industry began to deflate last year. A healthy budget surplus, a promise that the grey but trusted Mr Solbes would run the economy and a pledge to return EUR 400 ($630) to every taxpayer helped the Socialists to win the election. In effect, Mr Zapatero got back before voters realised how bad things were. His EUR 400 rebates will pump some EUR 6 billion into consumers' pockets. Yet much of it has already been swallowed up in higher mortgage payments and soaring petrol and food prices. The budget surplus has gone. This year Mr Solbes promises only ""almost balanced"" accounts.
What else can Mr Zapatero do? He has no control over interest rates, international finance or commodity prices. More infrastructure spending is touted as one answer, but with the Socialists pledging not to cut social spending, it will mean either more borrowing or finding offsetting spending cuts. More privatisation may help, as will a cut in the numbers of bureaucrats and a freeze on senior civil-service pay--but the amounts are not huge.
What the economy really needs, says the Bank of Spain, is to rein in wage growth and make the labour market more flexible. Mr Zapatero has called on unions and employers to start talking. But Mr Solbes has said that making it cheaper to fire workers is not a priority. Cuts in corporate-tax rates have also been ruled out. Other supply-side reforms, for instance to education, will have little immediate impact.
On the political side, too, Mr Zapatero is set for a bumpy second term. The PP leader, Mariano Rajoy, has at last shifted his party towards the centre after a long ideological battle. His reward, according to one poll, was to become more popular than Mr Zapatero for the first time. Mr Zapatero heads a minority government that is seven seats short of an absolute parliamentary majority. The small nationalist parties from Catalonia, the Basque country and elsewhere hold the balance of power. They are already playing tough over supporting next year's budget.
If the economy offers him no respite, where can Mr Zapatero turn to boost his flagging image? Step forward the Basque regional premier, Juan Jose Ibarretxe, who has called a double referendum on talks with the armed separatists, ETA, and on a vague Basque ""right to decide"". Mr Ibarretxe, a nationalist, is pushing the limits of devolution and seeking votes in the regional election due this autumn. But he may also have handed a gift to Mr Zapatero. The referendum gives him a chance to be hard on ETA and devolution--both areas where voters thought he was too soft in his first term. Mr Zapatero has said he will get the referendum banned by the constitutional court before it can take place.
This is not the only example of Mr Zapatero's deciding that being tough can pay. Spain's immigrants, most of whom arrived in the past seven years, have accounted for a big chunk of the economy's growth. Now they are starting to lose their jobs. Immigrants make up 11% of the workforce, but half of those who are newly unemployed. The government is offering to pay them a lump-sum unemployment benefit if they go home. A plan to stop them bringing over parents or adult children may discourage new immigrants. Both measures appeal to voters who fret that immigration has been too rapid. 
Mr Zapatero has spotted a problem that many Spaniards now confront for the first time, as they compete with immigrants for scarce jobs. In his second term, Spain's so far relaxed race relations may be tested. Fixing the economy would be the best answer. But getting tough on immigrants may prove an easier way to stay popular than promoting unloved economic reforms.",230,Spain,"Spanish voters are belatedly waking up to the extent of their economic problems--although the prime minister still denies them
SUCCESSES in soccer and politics do not always go together. Even as euphoric Spaniards revel in their team's Euro 2008 win on June 29th, they know that the real party, celebrating a decade of fizzy growth, is over. The Socialist prime minister, Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero, would prefer them to focus on sport, not the economy. But even though he was elected to a second term in March, his popularity is now tumbling, in line with the economy.
The litany of bad news has become interminable. Growth is slowing sharply and unemployment is rising. The housing bubble has burst and residential construction has seized up. Prices of petrol, electricity, food and a host of other things Spaniards buy have all gone up sharply, as (on July 3rd) did euro-area interest rates.
It is no surprise that half of all Spaniards now consider their personal financial position to be worse than in March. This may not be all Mr Zapatero's fault, but he is the man they are blaming. Striking truck-drivers caused chaos on the roads and left supermarket shelves empty for a week in June. The four-point lead that the Socialists had over the People's Party (PP) opposition in March has now evaporated.
It does not help that the government keeps denying that it faces a crisis. The finance minister, Pedro Solbes, refuses to utter the word ""crisis"" at all. Mr Zapatero told the daily El Pais that its use was ""a matter of opinion"". They are supported by Banco Santander's president, Emilio Botin, who compares the fraught state of the economy with a child's fever: dramatic, but short-lived. Yet crisis may be too bland a word: many economists think ""recession"" will soon be more appropriate. Mr Solbes admits that second-quarter growth will be below the first quarter's paltry 0.3%. His prediction of 2008 growth is now somewhere ""below"" 2%. On July 2nd a defiant Mr Zapatero told parliament he did not believe recession was coming.
In his first term, a smiling Mr Zapatero rode the crest of the economic wave, with a feel-good image of optimism and positive thinking. From regional devolution to gay marriage, he spread a message of goodwill to all. The economy was given little attention as it turned in growth rates well above 3% every year. Cures for every social or political ill seemed possible, as there was plenty of money around.

A POET'S bones may offer no clues to his genius, but how they are treated can speak volumes about his country. The remains of Federico Garcia Lorca, poet and playwright, at the centre of a row over Spain's violent past, are no exception. His is the most famous name on a list of 130,137 victims of the repression unleashed by Franco that was handed over to a Madrid court this week. The list is a first attempt to produce a comprehensive account of atrocities carried out in the generalissimo's name. It includes those condemned by kangaroo courts, as well as others taken from their homes, shot and buried in unmarked mass graves.
The list was produced after an investigation into the fate of those who disappeared during the civil war. That investigation, opened by a magistrate, Baltasar Garzon, may pull down the wall of silence over this painful subject. It may also lead to the opening of hundreds of mass graves so that bodies can be recovered, identified and handed to families for reburial. 
The judge's investigation has provoked indignation on the right. Critics argue that the transition to democracy after Franco's death in 1975 included an agreement not to stir up the bitter divisions of the civil war. A 1977 amnesty ensures that nobody can be tried for abuses committed by Franco's regime. Mariano Rajoy, leader of the opposition People's Party, has said he is ""against reopening old wounds"".
Even the Socialist prime minister, Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero, whose grandfather was shot by a Francoist firing squad, has found it tricky to navigate the minefield of Spain's past. A ""historical memory"" law passed last year enraged the right but was denounced by campaigners as toothless. ""The law is both lightweight and low cost,"" said Emilio Silva, founder of a volunteer group that has exhumed 1,200 victims. Judge Garzon, he added, has now opened the floodgates. ""This takes the debate out of the political sphere,"" he noted. ""Hundreds of people have written to us in the past weeks.""
Relatives of Dioscoro Galindo, a teacher, were among those who delivered the names to Judge Garzon. Galindo is thought to have been shot and buried with Lorca and two anarchist bullfighters in a grave on a hillside above his home city, Granada. Galindo's relatives have spent five years campaigning for the grave to be dug up. They have always been opposed by Lorca's family.

ONLY a genuine crisis could have prompted such a role reversal: a British prime minister, ""the magician of Anglo-Saxon social-liberalism"" as Le Monde called him, giving lessons on market intervention to his European colleagues. Even France's president, Nicolas Sarkozy, who had invited Britain's Gordon Brown to an emergency summit of euro-area countries on October 12th, hailed the outcome as the start of a new era, adding that ""the time of every man for himself is over."" 
Europe's leaders duly agreed to follow Mr Brown's example, putting up huge sums of money and standing ready to recapitalise and take equity stakes in their banks (
). A staggering total of some EUR 1,873 billion ($2,556 billion) was agreed for this purpose in the euro area alone. And unlike the previous week, stockmarkets were momentarily impressed. On October 13th and 14th they rose strongly, only to fall back sharply later in the week as fears of recession grew.
France has pledged EUR 320 billion in state-guaranteed lending to banks, and EUR 40 billion to recapitalise banks in trouble. The lending comes with conditions, including over bosses' pay. For now, there are few demands for help. The British may be partly nationalising three of their biggest banks; the French have bailed out just one, Dexia, a small Franco-Belgian lender. 
In truth, the bail-out fund is intended as a precautionary, confidence-boosting measure. Thanks to their wide retail networks, and relatively tight regulation, most French banks have been able to absorb the huge losses they have made on subprime loans in America. Nor have the French been on a huge credit binge. The household savings rate remains high.
Yet worries are growing about the economy. Third-quarter GDP figures are likely to show that the French economy is already in recession. The IMF forecasts growth of just 0.2% in 2009; plenty of economists expect an outright contraction. Unemployment has begun to climb. Renault, a carmaker, recently announced 4,000 job cuts in France. 
Germany's rescue package includes a state guarantee worth EUR 400 billion to back banks' loans to each other, plus EUR 80 billion to top up capital. As elsewhere no ""system-relevant"" bank will be allowed to fail; no depositor will lose money. At the end of 2009 the life support will be switched off and the free market is meant to be back in business again.
German shares briefly surged after the unveiling of the rescue deal. The head of Germany's banking association said that it signalled ""the turnaround"". Ordinary politics was put aside. After early wobbles Germany's top crisis managers, the chancellor, Angela Merkel, and the finance minister, Peer Steinbruck, appeared to regain their footing, joining in the European bail-out having previously rejecting the idea of a common fund. 
Yet the mood in Germany remains jittery. The government is struggling to explain to voters how half a trillion euros--nearly double the federal budget--can be available for bankers but not for pensions or schools. It hopes the strings attached will help. Banks will pay fees for the guarantees. If the state tops up capital they must stop paying dividends and cut salaries and bonuses. Those that use the lifeline should not earn more than EUR 500,000 a year, said Mr Steinbruck. 
Even if the bail-out works, Germany will not avoid a slowdown. The IMF expects no growth at all next year. In a forecast on October 14th, the five main economic institutes predicted growth of just 0.2%. Germany has sounder public finances, less indebted enterprises and more competitive wages than others. Yet it is more dependent on exports, so will be hit harder by a global slowdown. Club Med blues
In January Italy takes over the G8 presidency, and will have a chance to shape reform of the world financial system. Giulio Tremonti, Italy's finance minister and author of a book sharply critical of the present arrangements, wants radical reform, with a broadened G8 and new roles for the IMF and World Bank. He also wants discussion on abolishing hedge funds, which he says are ""absolutely crazy"" and ""nothing to do with capitalism"".
Yet both he and his prime minister, Silvio Berlusconi, exude confidence that Italy's banks are healthy. ""The soundest in Europe"", Mr Berlusconi has called them. As Mr Tremonti admitted to parliament, this is partly because Italian banks are ""less advanced and sophisticated"" than others in Europe. So far, only the enterprising UniCredit has suffered, largely because of its exposure in Germany where in 2005 it bought HypoVereinsbank.
The government has belatedly begun to equip itself with legislation to allow it to intervene in the banks. But Italy is alone among the big European countries in having neither a bank rescue fund nor a figure for the sum it is ready to make available. Mr Tremonti has merely said he would spend ""as much as necessary"". 
Tito Boeri, an economics professor at Milan's Bocconi University, applauds Mr Tremonti's measured response to the banking crisis, but worries that ""he is not fully aware of the effect on the real economy."" The government is still forecasting GDP growth of 0.5% in 2009 and Mr Berlusconi said this week the economy was ""certainly not in recession"". But this is now a minority view. The employers' federation, Confindustria, expects the economy to shrink by 0.2% this year and 0.5% next. 
Spain's prime minister, Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero, is one of the few European leaders still smiling. His country's banks lack liquidity but none has needed rescuing. Indeed, Banco Santander, now Europe's biggest bank, has gone on a buying spree of failing banks in Britain and America. In today's topsy-turvy world, Socialist-led Spain seems one of the least interventionist countries in Europe.
Yet Mr Zapatero has little reason to feel smug. If banks have survived, it is thanks to the Bank of Spain's tight regulation and to the prudence of Spanish bankers. Some savings banks still look vulnerable. And on the economic front, Spain is worse off than many others. The financial crisis is hitting an already wounded economy. A burst housing bubble has punctured Spain's growth. Recession is around the corner. The IMF expects the economy to shrink by 0.2% next year. The unemployment claimant count stormed to an 11-year-high in September. ""Spain's economy will be in a worse situation in a year's time than other European economies,"" concludes Jose Luis Martinez, a strategist at Citibank.
The cost of the bank bail-outs and the coming recession also raise questions about governments' fiscal positions. Ireland this week became the first euro-area member to declare that it would bust the stability-pact ceiling on budget deficits of 3% of GDP next year: it expects a deficit closer to 6%. France and Italy, which has the euro area's biggest debt burden, are also close to the limit. Even in Germany and Spain budget deficits are likely to climb. The markets are starting to reassess individual countries: the spread on Italian over German government debt has widened to some 70 basis points, for instance. 
That may increase worries about the solidity of the euro. Nobody seriously expects it to fall apart--indeed, the euro has protected its more vulnerable members from what might otherwise have been serious currency crises. But Europe may be facing its worst recession since the early 1990s--before the euro existed. This will test the single currency as much as anything else it has faced in its short life.",230,Spain,"The promise of huge bank bail-outs only briefly calmed financial markets, as worries then shifted towards the risk of a deep recession

FRANCISCO FRANCO, the dictator of Spain for 36 years, has been dead for a while. His body was safely deposited in a grave marked by a pharaonic, 150-metre cross in 1975. He belongs to the past. So why has a Spanish judge decided that it is time to accuse the deceased general of committing crimes against humanity? 
Judge Baltasar Garzon, the magistrate who is pursuing the general's ghost, has a well-established reputation for testing the limits of the law. In 1998 he had one of Franco's more notorious admirers, Chile's General Augusto Pinochet, arrested in London while he tried to extradite him to Spain for similar crimes. 
Now the controversial judge has declared himself competent to investigate 114,000 killings carried out by Franco's people during and after the Spanish civil war. Along with Franco himself, he has accused 34 former generals and ministers of crimes against humanity committed between 1936 and 1951. All are dead. 
That means that it is Spain's history that is really on trial. This is no easy matter. The civil war and dictatorship that followed left painful memories. Spain has done its best to sweep these under the carpet. A tacit pact after Franco's death saw politicians of all colours agree not to rake over the past. A 1977 amnesty law settled the terms in writing. None of Franco's henchmen could be tried. 
The spirit of that pact, however, had already died before Mr Garzon got involved. Groups of volunteers have been digging up mass graves left by Francoist death squads, returning thousands of victims' remains to their families for reburial. Thousands more are still to be found.
Politicians on the left have meanwhile discovered that bringing up Francoism is a simple way to bait the right. Last year the Socialist government of Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero passed an historical memory law aimed at helping Franco's victims. The opposition People's Party reacted angrily. The PP's position is, however, ambiguous and open to challenge. After all, its founding president, Manuel Fraga, served as a minister under Franco. 
Mr Fraga was among the first to criticise Judge Garzon, who has also ordered the digging up of 19 graves, including one in which the poet Federico Garcia Lorca is thought to be buried. It was outlandish, complained Mr Fraga, given the 1977 amnesty law. 
The judge has produced a fresh interpretation of those laws. Where a victim's body has never been found, he asserts, a crime of kidnapping continues to this day. So it is not covered by the amnesty. To those who argue that international laws on crimes against humanity did not exist when the civil war ended in 1939, he points to the precedent of the Nuremberg trials of top Nazis. Yet Spain's attorney-general is not impressed. He has accused Mr Garzon of launching an inquisition and lodged an appeal against his case.
Mr Garzon has previously used international human-rights laws to try, condemn and jail in Spain human-rights abusers who worked for military regimes elsewhere, notably in Argentina. Franco and the men he has named so far are dead, but campaigners believe that others who took part in the repression are still alive. Mr Garzon may have opened the way for them, too, to be tried.",230,Spain,"Judge Baltasar Garzon indicts a dead dictator and his henchmen

ON THE outskirts of every Spanish city and town, and even some villages, you will see neat rows of houses or blocks of flats in various stages of (in)completion. Cranes rise in their midst. Newly tarred roads with street lights continue on into vacant land. All is silent. What hit Spain was a combination of its own excesses and the effect of toxic financial assets elsewhere. When the first signs of the credit crunch appeared in August 2007 Spain was in a frenzy of building, putting up some 700,000 new housing units a year--more than France, Germany and Italy combined.
Thanks to immigration, Spain's population has increased from 40m to 45m since 2000. Even so, only 400,000 new households are set up every year; in addition, some 150,000 foreigners buy houses, mainly northern Europeans in search of second homes. The construction boom was exaggerated by a potent mixture of perverse incentives. First, money was cheap after Spain adopted the euro. In setting interest rates, the European Central Bank is guided mainly by economic conditions in Germany and France. Because of Spain's higher inflation, interest rates there were close to zero in real terms.
Second, policy and culture interacted to make a housing bubble more likely. Mortgage-interest payments are partially deductible from income tax. Total fiscal subsidies for home-ownership equal around 1% of GDP, according to the OECD. In the 1950s half the population rented. But the law heavily favours tenants over landlords, which caused a shortage of rented property. As Spaniards got richer they poured their savings into housing. Fernando Encinar of Idealista.com, an online estate agency, notes that Spain has about 50% more homes than it has households. Many middle-class families have a second home near the beach or in the grandparents' village in the country, or as an investment. There is no tax on empty property.
The third factor was a powerful nexus of local politicians, property developers and the cajas de ahorros (savings banks) that make up half of the country's financial system. Spanish towns are typically quite dense, ending abruptly in open countryside. Building on vacant land requires the ayuntamiento to extend the town limits, which then entitles it to 10% of the development land. Selling this 10% back to the developer became a main source of revenue for many ayuntamientos (sometimes councillors also got bribes to approve the new developments). In turn, the local politicians who control the cajas, which are quasi-mutual outfits, provided the developers with loans. With house-price rises averaging 12% a year for most of this decade, it seemed like a one-way bet.
Then the bet suddenly turned sour. The costas were hit first. Overbuilding and the popping of the housing bubble in Britain (the largest single source of second-homers) caused prices to slump. Next, the credit squeeze kicked in with a vengeance. Now almost 1m unsold homes sit vacant across the country. Prices of existing homes in Barcelona and Madrid have fallen by up to 10% in the past year. Mr Encinar reckons that average prices will fall by up to 50% in nominal terms (though rather less in real terms) before they stabilise. 
The first casualties have been estate agents. In Malaga at the peak there were more estate agents than hairdressers, says Mr Encinar. Half those offices have closed in the past year. The next victims are the property companies. The biggest, Martinsa-Fadesa, collapsed in July, owing EUR 5.2 billion, the largest bankruptcy in Spanish history. Others are in trouble, partly because they are sitting on land banks of uncertain value. Then come the cajas. The average of overdue loans in the financial system has already climbed to 2.5% of all loans; for the cajas the figure is 2.9%. Jose Vinals of the Bank of Spain, the central bank, insists: ""We don't see any financial entity whose viability is compromised."" But he adds that banks and cajas will have to adjust their cost structures to slower growth. Mr Zapatero has said that some cajas should merge and that the government should help them to do so. 
A private banker is blunter. He expects the coming recession to reshape the Spanish financial system, as did the recessions of the early 1980s and early 1990s. He reckons that around a dozen of the smaller cajas, mainly on the Mediterranean coast, will have to be bailed out by merging with stronger ones, perhaps with government support. Some smaller banks may be sold to foreign institutions. 
If the damage turned out to be no worse than that, it would be tribute to the strength of Spain's financial system. So far there has been no Spanish equivalent of Northern Rock, a British mortgage lender that had to be nationalised, let alone a Fortis or a Lehman Brothers or AIG. That is because those earlier recessions and their attendant bank collapses bequeathed both sound regulation and relatively conservative banking practices. As the financial boom got under way, the Bank of Spain introduced a countercyclical element to loan-loss provisioning. ""We think that risk arises not when a loan becomes overdue but when it is granted,"" says Mr Vinals. So banks have to set aside a small generic provision when issuing a loan, as a kind of insurance policy. The Bank later obliged any institution setting up an off-balance-sheet Special Investment Vehicle to take a large capital charge--large enough to dissuade them from doing so. The solid few
After the frantic consolidation of the early 1990s Spain is left with two giant banks, Santander and BBVA; a handful of middling ones; scores of smaller ones; and 45 cajas. It is the cajas that have the biggest exposure to mortgages and property developers, partly because the two big banks have chosen to grow abroad. 
Both Santander and BBVA have a strong capital and deposit base and have largely stuck to commercial banking, eschewing investment banking and derivatives. Spain accounts for only 35% of Santander's total business. ""We'll clearly see slower growth, an increase in overdue loans and a demand for higher provisions,"" says Alfredo Saenz, the group's chief executive. The bank has spent EUR 2.5 billion buying assets from its property-company clients as a pragmatic way of reducing bad loans. In some cases it has had to accept a loss on these assets. Against that, margins are widening. Santander's profits in Spain have been growing at 20% a year. Mr Saenz expects that figure to remain in double digits, but that will require cost-cutting, including early retirement of some of the bank's staff. 
Spain accounts for 40% of BBVA's profits (and Mexico for 26%). Francisco Gonzalez, its chief executive, notes that the bank has generic provisions of EUR 3.5 billion and should be able to deal with an increase in overdue loans without profits being affected. The bank's net income is still growing at 10%, he says, compared with over 20% last year. ""We're comfortable with our capital position, have a lot of liquidity and relatively good asset quality in relation to creditors,"" he adds. ""We'll pass through a storm, there'll be wounds, but those who emerge will be winners."" 
The third-largest financial group is Barcelona's La Caixa, the biggest of the cajas. Two-thirds of its loans are mortgages and another 12% are to developers and building firms, according to Juan Maria Nin, its chief executive. But it has a large cash pile, is well capitalised and can draw on a portfolio of industrial investments, which includes big stakes in Telefonica, two energy companies, Gas Natural and Repsol, a water utility, Agbar, and a toll-road operator, Abertis. It has recently taken stakes in banks in Hong Kong and Mexico as it seeks to follow the big two banks in expanding abroad. 
Mr Nin says that defaults on Spanish home loans will be relatively low, for several reasons. Almost 90% of La Caixa's mortgages had a loan-to-value ratio of less than 80% in June; the average was 50%. Spanish banks insist on guarantees; homeowners and their guarantors remain liable for the mortgage payments even if they hand back the keys of the property. And when workers are laid off they are entitled to unemployment benefits worth 80% of their pay for 18 months. 
So the direct effect of the property bust on the financial system should be containable. But that is not the end of the story of woe. The slowdown in consumption and the international credit crunch is hitting the rest of the economy--and will eventually hurt some banks. Both Spain's government and its businesses are less indebted than they were last time recession struck, but households are deeper in the red: total household debt is equal to 84% of GDP (still a smaller share than in Britain, Ireland or the Netherlands). No wonder that in the first nine months of 2008 sales of new cars were down 22% on last year. 
Though Spanish banks have a strong deposit base, until a year ago they were refinancing some EUR 100 billion a year in the markets, partly by issuing cedulas hipotecarias. These are 15-year covered bonds backed by prime mortgages and guaranteed by the bank's assets (Spanish banks keep mortgages on their books even after they have securitised the debt). Now they are being confused with subprime mortgages and nobody is buying them, says Guillermo de la Dehesa, the (Spanish) chairman of the Centre for Economic Policy Research, a London-based group. As an alternative the banks and cajas are borrowing from the European Central Bank's emergency liquidity window, but this is a short-term stopgap. The stronger banks can still issue short-term notes. Squeezed, not crunched
Both the government and blue-chip companies are finding credit more expensive. Government bonds now attract a risk premium of some 60 basis points (ie, 0.6 %) over their German equivalents, and companies have seen the cost of loans rise by up to three times that amount. So far, however, Spain has faced merely a credit squeeze rather than a full-blown crunch in which credit is no longer available, says Mr de la Dehesa. 
That is not how it feels to many businesses, hit by lack of liquidity and slowing consumer demand. Having previously rejected calls from bankers and businesspeople to inject liquidity into the economy, the government ended up matching rescue measures taken by Britain, the United States and others. Last month Mr Zapatero announced a EUR 50 billion fund to help the banking system. This will buy cedulas hipotecarias and bundles of bank loans, but only those with a triple-A credit rating. The government also raised its guarantee on bank deposits from EUR 20,000 to EUR 100,000. Days later it offered to guarantee up to EUR 100 billion of bank borrowing this year and an unspecified sum next year, as part of a co-ordinated European effort to ungum the money markets.
The government had already done some fiscal pump-priming earlier. Shortly after the election it announced a EUR 400 rebate for every taxpayer, half of it paid in June and the other due in December. But falling tax revenues have swiftly pushed the public finances into the red. The draft budget foresees a deficit of 1.5% of GDP this year and 1.9% next. The banking fund will help to push the public debt up to 38.8% of GDP next year.
In September Mr Solbes announced a EUR 3 billion credit line to encourage property companies to let out their empty flats. But that will only slightly reduce the stockpile of unsold homes. Reviving the rental market requires a new law to help landlords. 
The sooner house prices fall, the faster Spain will recover from the bust. The housebuilding industry needs to shrink from a swollen 9% of GDP in 2007 to a more normal 5% or so. Mr Solbes says that this year 160,000 fewer houses are being completed than in 2007, which alone implies a 1% fall in GDP. Yet each job in the building industry also generated three or four jobs indirectly, says Mr Fidalgo. With housebuilding knocked out as the engine of growth and employment, Spain will have to find something to replace it.

FOR much of the Middle Ages, after the invasion of Muslim Berbers and Arabs in the eighth century, Spain was a multicultural country. Several Christian kingdoms pushed the Arabs south, finally reconquering the last remnant of the Caliphate of Al-Andalus in 1492. There had been collaboration as well as conflict. But the victorious and dogmatic Catholics ordered first the forcible conversion of Jews and Muslims and, eventually, their expulsion. Since the early 17th century Spain has been, officially at least, a monolithically white Christian country. 
Until recently. In the past decade some 5m immigrants have arrived in Spain. In all, 12% of the population is now foreign-born, up from 3% in 1998. During that period Spain has absorbed more immigrants than any other country except the United States. Some 700,000 of those foreigners are sun-seeking Britons, and there are many Germans too. But most of the new arrivals come from poorer countries. Moroccans tend the sunloungers on the beaches and toil on building sites alongside Bulgarians and Romanians. Ecuadoreans and Bolivians work in the plastic greenhouses of Almeria and in domestic service. Cubans and Dominicans help out as carers. Black African street vendors hawk bags and flowers.
Spain has so far lived in harmony with these newcomers. It helps that most Spanish families remember the time from the 1950s to the 1980s when at least one of their members emigrated to find work. It helps, too, that around 1.5m of the newcomers are Latin Americans. ""History, language and similarity of culture have all eased integration,"" says Raul Jimenez of the Ruminahui Association, a group that helps Ecuadorean migrants. But Spain now also has 1.1m Muslims. Mosques are in use in Granada again for the first time in 500 years. Despite the Islamist bombings of 2004 there has not been an outburst of Islamophobia. The Muslims in Spain are ""exceptionally moderate and well-integrated"", according to Mr Rubalcaba, the interior minister. However, since the bombings the ministry has rounded up a few radical groups involved in recruiting and fundraising for al-Qaeda.
What has also eased absorption is that successive governments have granted amnesties to a total of 1.2m illegal immigrants, bringing them out of the black economy.

Spaniards also know that the social-security system has been saved from actuarial insolvency by the contributions of young immigrants.
According to Mr Jimenez, the newcomers have generally been treated well, but he and many others worry that rising unemployment will bring intolerance.

Mr Rajoy campaigned against Mr Zapatero's amnesty, and the government has taken more energetic steps to prevent illegal immigration. It has also unveiled a scheme to allow migrants to draw their unemployment insurance as a lump sum if they return to their home country and renounce their residence rights in Spain. Nobody expects many takers.",230,Spain,"Attitudes to immigration are turning more cautious
FOR much of the Middle Ages, after the invasion of Muslim Berbers and Arabs in the eighth century, Spain was a multicultural country. Several Christian kingdoms pushed the Arabs south, finally reconquering the last remnant of the Caliphate of Al-Andalus in 1492. There had been collaboration as well as conflict. But the victorious and dogmatic Catholics ordered first the forcible conversion of Jews and Muslims and, eventually, their expulsion. Since the early 17th century Spain has been, officially at least, a monolithically white Christian country. 
Until recently. In the past decade some 5m immigrants have arrived in Spain. In all, 12% of the population is now foreign-born, up from 3% in 1998. During that period Spain has absorbed more immigrants than any other country except the United States. Some 700,000 of those foreigners are sun-seeking Britons, and there are many Germans too. But most of the new arrivals come from poorer countries. Moroccans tend the sunloungers on the beaches and toil on building sites alongside Bulgarians and Romanians. Ecuadoreans and Bolivians work in the plastic greenhouses of Almeria and in domestic service. Cubans and Dominicans help out as carers. Black African street vendors hawk bags and flowers.
Spain has so far lived in harmony with these newcomers. It helps that most Spanish families remember the time from the 1950s to the 1980s when at least one of their members emigrated to find work. It helps, too, that around 1.5m of the newcomers are Latin Americans. ""History, language and similarity of culture have all eased integration,"" says Raul Jimenez of the Ruminahui Association, a group that helps Ecuadorean migrants. But Spain now also has 1.1m Muslims. Mosques are in use in Granada again for the first time in 500 years. Despite the Islamist bombings of 2004 there has not been an outburst of Islamophobia. The Muslims in Spain are ""exceptionally moderate and well-integrated"", according to Mr Rubalcaba, the interior minister. However, since the bombings the ministry has rounded up a few radical groups involved in recruiting and fundraising for al-Qaeda.
What has also eased absorption is that successive governments have granted amnesties to a total of 1.2m illegal immigrants, bringing them out of the black economy. Moreover, Spain's welfare state is newer than those of other western European countries and there is less of a sense that immigrants are straining public services (though in schools they are). Spaniards also know that the social-security system has been saved from actuarial insolvency by the contributions of young immigrants.

THE hardest problem for the authors of Spain's democratic constitution was to strike a balance between the central government and the claims of Catalonia, the Basque country and Galicia for home rule. The formula they came up with was known as cafe para todos, or coffee for all: Spain was divided into 17 ""autonomous communities"" (plus the enclave cities of Ceuta and Melilla on the Moroccan coast), each with its own elected parliament and government. This estado de las autonomias seemed a neat solution. Over the past 30 years more and more powers and money have been devolved. The regional governments are now responsible for schools, universities, health, social services, culture, urban and rural development and, in some places, policing. But it is becoming clear that even as it has solved some problems, decentralisation has created others.
The estado de las autonomias has several clear benefits. First, as Mr Zapatero says, ""it spreads power and impedes its concentration,"" and in that way reflects ""the best liberal thinking"". Second, by bringing decisions about services closer to the people it has improved them. Third, it encourages competition between regions. The rivalry between Barcelona and Madrid may have acquired an edge of mistrust, but it is in essence a creative tension. And fourth, the system has reduced regional inequalities, or at least stopped them widening. 
To get a sense of the success of decentralisation, head not to Catalonia or the Basque country but to the south. In the 1970s Andalucia seemed much closer to Africa than Europe--and not just geographically. Rural labourers lived in semi-servitude and one adult in five was illiterate. Now it has narrowed the gap with the rest of Spain in many ways. The south is still poorer than the north, but Spain no longer has anything like Italy's mezzogiorno. 
In other parts of the country Valencia and Zaragoza have become thrusting cities with an economic and cultural life of their own, and Bilbao's metamorphosis from a centre of declining heavy industry into a cultural and tourist magnet, started off by its Guggenheim Museum, has become a textbook case of urban regeneration.
All this has come at a political price. First, it has led to a renaissance of an old Spanish political phenomenon, the cacique or provincial political boss, as Antonio Munoz Molina, a leading novelist, points out. Mr Pujol ran Catalonia for 23 years; Manuel Fraga, a former minister under Franco who founded the forerunner of the PP, ran Galicia for 15 years; and Manuel Chaves, a Socialist who has headed Andalucia's regional government since 1990, is said to reign rather than govern. 
These modern princes have their courts. ""Every regional government wants its own universities, contemporary-art museum and science museum,"" says Josep Ramoneda, who heads the Centre for Contemporary Culture in Barcelona. ""In the United States there's only one Hollywood. Here they want 17."" In Andalucia the regional government is by far the biggest employer, and the biggest advertiser in the regional press. Every regional government has its own television station. Mr Zapatero has taken to holding regular ""presidents' conferences"" with his regional counterparts. The latest one attracted 600 journalists. ""It looked like the UN General Assembly, with six or seven satellite trucks outside,"" notes Enric Juliana, a journalist for La Vanguardia, a Barcelona newspaper. 
The regional governments even get involved in foreign policy. Some have aid budgets. Mr Munoz Molina, who was the director of the New York office of the Instituto Cervantes, a body to promote Spanish culture, recalls that regional presidents would turn up in the city with vast entourages. Most of these missions were badly organised and achieved nothing except favourable coverage in their captive media. Coffee just for us
But this panoply of decentralisation has not placated the politicians in Catalonia, the Basque country and Galicia. That is because they never wanted cafe para todos: they wanted it just for themselves, as a recognition that they were different. They still want that, no matter that Spain is now an extraordinarily decentralised country in which the Basques, for example, enjoy a greater degree of home rule than any other region in Europe. Their demands make it difficult to draw up a stable and permanent set of rules. 
Catalan and Basque ""nationalists"" argue that unlike, say, La Rioja or Murcia, their territories are nations, not regions (nor ""nationalities"", in the tortuous formulation of the constitution), and invoke history to support their claim. ""Here the conflict dates from 1836,"" insists Joseba Aurrekoetxea, a leader of the Basque Nationalist Party (PNV), referring to the Carlist war after which the central government revoked the Basques' fiscal privileges (restored in 1979). ""Catalonia was always distinct,"" says Artur Mas, who replaced Mr Pujol as leader of CiU. It descends from the medieval kingdom of Aragon, and rebelled against Madrid in 1640 and in 1701. 
But Catalan and Basque nationalism are creations of the late 19th century. They stem from industrialisation, which made these the richest regions in the country, taking in migrants from elsewhere in Spain. At the time the Spanish state, unlike its French counterpart, lacked the resources to integrate the country, says Antonio Elorza, a Basque political scientist at Madrid's Complutense University. Otherwise Catalonia and the Basque country would have been as content within Spain as Languedoc and Brittany are within France. 
Perhaps because the historic claim to nationhood is shaky, language has become an obsession for the nationalists. Franco banned the public use of Catalan, Euskera (Basque) and Gallego. The constitution made these languages official ones alongside Spanish in their respective territories. In Catalonia the official policy of the Generalitat (the regional government), under both the nationalists (some of whom are really localists) and now the Socialists, is one of ""bilingualism"". In practice this means that all primary and secondary schooling is conducted in Catalan, with Spanish taught as a foreign language. Catalan is also the language of regional government. A Spaniard who speaks no Catalan has almost no chance of teaching at a university in Barcelona. A play or film in Spanish will not be subsidised from public funds. ""If we don't make a big effort to preserve our own language, it risks disappearing,"" says Mr Mas. 
Catalan and Spanish are more or less mutually comprehensible. Not so Euskera, which does not belong to the Indo-European family of languages. The Basque government allows schools to choose between three alternative curriculums, one in Euskera, another in Spanish and the third half and half. But in practice only schools in poor immigrant areas now offer the Spanish curriculum. Despite these efforts, Basque and Catalan are far from universally spoken in their respective territories: only around half of Catalans habitually use Catalan and about 25% of Basques speak Euskera. 
The nationalists' linguistic dogmatism is provoking a backlash. Earlier this year Mr Savater, the philosopher, together with a diverse group of public figures ranging from Placido Domingo, a tenor, to Iker Casillas, Real Madrid's goalkeeper, signed a ""manifesto"" in defence of the right of citizens to be educated in Spanish. They were denounced as ""Castilian nationalists"" in the Socialist press. But they touched a nerve. Many thoughtful Catalans believe that Catalan would be safe if it remained the language of primary schools, but that Catalonia would gain much by allowing a choice between Catalan and Spanish in secondary schools. The power of language
The argument about language is really about power. ""The problem with nationalists is that the more you give them, the more they want,"" says Mr Savater. What some of them want is independence; all of them use this as a more or less explicit threat to gain more public money and powers. The polling evidence suggests that no more than a fifth of Catalans are remotely tempted by the idea of independence. The figure for Basques is around a quarter, despite 30 years of nationalist self-government and control of education and the media, and despite the departure of around 10% of the population because of ETA's violence, points out Francisco Llera, a (Socialist) political scientist in Bilbao.
ETA's political support is declining, though not vanishing. The PNV is split between a pro-independence wing led by Juan Jose Ibarretxe, the president of the regional government, and home-rulers in the party leadership. Mr Ibarretxe wants to hold a referendum on the right of Basques to self-determination. Mr Aurrekoetxea argues that ETA should not have a veto over whether Basques can peacefully express a view on the future. 
The government, parliament and the courts have all blocked the referendum plan ""because it is against the constitution"", says Mr Zapatero. ""It would make ETA right in fighting on the basis that this is an oppressed people,"" says Jose Antonio Pastor, a Basque Socialist. He and many other non-nationalist politicians and their families must live with round-the-clock bodyguards. In parts of the Basque country, in the tight rural valleys on the borders of Vizcaya and Guipuzcoa, non-nationalists cannot campaign freely. The Socialists hope to win a Basque regional election due in March. To improve their chances, they are following their Catalan peers in embracing cultural nationalism. 
Buying off the Basque and Catalan nationalists with more money has become harder. The central government now accounts for just 18% of public spending; the regional governments spend 38%, the ayuntamientos (municipal councils) 13% and the social-security system the rest. But under the new Catalan autonomy statute more money has to be devolved. Over the next seven years Catalonia will have to be given a share of public investment equivalent to its weight in the Spanish economy, which will amount to an extra EUR 5 billion a year. Previously Catalonia, although Spain's fourth-richest region, received less public spending per head than several others. It complains that its commuter trains, in particular, have been starved of funds.
The Basques have no such worries: each Basque province and Navarre collect their own taxes and hand over less than 10% to the central government in Madrid. But they benefit from central-government defence spending, and they are net recipients from the social-security system. As a result, public spending per person in the Basque country is the highest in Spain. 
The new Catalan statute requires the government to strike a new regional financing deal, even though the one in 2001 was supposed to be final. But it is to the central government that Spaniards will look for unemployment benefits and for spending to alleviate recession. Local governments are likely to suffer budget cuts by 2010, if not next year. 
The government's ability to carry out economic reforms is also compromised by decentralisation. As regional governments acquire more and more power to regulate, businesses face higher compliance costs. Now that the government employment service has been decentralised, Jose Maria Fidalgo, the general secretary of the Workers' Commissions, the largest trade-union federation, worries that jobseekers have to look at 17 different websites. 
It would have been easier for all concerned if Spain had adopted federalism in 1978. That would have set clear rules and aligned responsibilities for taxing and spending. The Senate could have become a place where the regions were formally represented and could settle their differences, akin to Germany's Bundesrat. But the Catalan and Basque nationalists will only accept a confederation of several ""nations"". The PP also opposes federalism.
In the meantime Spain must muddle on. ""The great Spanish project is not in danger, but it's like a plant that requires constant tending,"" says Narcis Serra, who used to be Mr Gonzalez's vice-president and now runs Caixa Catalunya, a savings bank. ""It's important that Catalonia is comfortable in the project."" The government in Madrid could make some gestures to the regions, such as moving some regulatory agencies or other national bodies out of the capital. And would it really be the end of Spain if the Basques, like the Welsh, had their own national football team? 
Elsewhere in the country anti-nationalism is starting to stir. Mr Savater and Rosa Diez, a former Basque Socialist leader, have set up a new party of the radical centre called Union, Progress and Democracy (UPyD), in an effort to combine social liberalism with a defence of the idea of Spain. They hope to profit from the rising disillusion with both the main parties. Even though it lacked money and access to the media, it won 1.2% of the vote in the March election, the same as the PNV. But because the electoral system disproportionately rewards geographically concentrated votes, the UPyD secured only one deputy, Ms Diez, against the PNV's six. It hopes to do better in an election to the European Parliament next June, for which the whole country will count as a single constituency.

DOWN on the Barcelona waterfront, on what used to be industrial wasteland before the area was developed for the 1992 Olympic games, a striking new building of wood and glass houses the Barcelona Biomedical Research Park. It is a joint venture between the Generalitat, the Barcelona city council and Pompeu Fabra University. Some 800 scientists, about a third of them foreigners, work at the long white benches with their jumble of flasks, instruments and computers. The six different research groups scattered around the building span various aspects of biomedicine, epidemiology and genomics. 
Some EUR 40m of the park's annual budget of EUR 65m comes from research grants. In the past 15 years Spain has risen fast in the world league-table of articles published in scientific journals, to ninth place. Jordi Cami, a neuroscientist who is the research park's founding director, hopes to use ""the glamour of Barcelona"" to attract leading scientists from around the world and compete for talent with London, Singapore and Cambridge, Massachusetts.
No wonder Mr Zapatero came to open the building in August last year. The research park exactly matches his government's idea of Spain's ""new economic model"", in which brainpower is more important than the muscle of building workers or the sun and sand of tourism. To that end he has created a new Ministry of Science and Innovation. The minister, Cristina Garmendia, is a founder of Genetrix, a biotech start-up which she says is about to become the first European company to launch a drug derived from stem cells. 
Public spending on research and development has tripled since 2000. The problem is that private spending is negligible. The answer, says Ms Garmendia, is to build bridges between universities and companies. Spain is poor at turning research into patents and products. Investment in biotech, for instance, is now EUR 60m, up sixfold in eight years, but still only a tenth of the British or German total.
Miguel Sebastian, the industry minister, talks up Spain's growing prowess and potential in a long list of innovative businesses, ranging from renewable energy to aerospace and information technology. In some of these Spain is already a world leader. Take a high-speed train across the meseta, the high plain with hot, arid summers and harsh winters that covers much of Spain, and your eye will be caught by batteries of upturned solar panels along the tracks, tilted to catch the relentless Spanish sun. The mountain ridges that corrugate the meseta are crowned by gigantic wind turbines--an appropriate sight in the land of Don Quixote. 
The renewables industry is subsidised, as it is everywhere, but the country now gets 22% of its electricity from this source, and three of the world's five biggest renewables companies are Spanish. They are developing a world-class network of technologically sophisticated suppliers, and costs are falling as the technology improves. But the country, which has to import all its gas and oil, needs a broader discussion about energy policy. The PP wants an urgent debate on whether to expand nuclear power. Mr Zapatero does not. Plodding productivity
Innovation takes time, and on its own it is not enough: Spain also has to make its existing economy more efficient. ""We need to raise productivity in hotels and retail as well as in biogenetics. We need to do everything better, starting with education and regulation,"" says Mr Rato, who now works for Lazards, an investment bank. 
Productivity growth has traditionally been slow in Spain. According to the OECD, between 1990 and 1997 it averaged just 0.3% a year, a third of what it was in Germany, France and Italy, the three largest euro-area economies. And more recently things have got worse: the OECD reckons that between 1998 and 2006 total factor productivity (ie, the combined effect of labour, capital and technology) actually fell by 0.2% a year. A Spanish government study disagreed, finding that productivity rose during that period, but only by around 0.3% a year, and that half of the country's economic growth came from immigration. Part of the explanation for the poor productivity figures is that many new jobs were in low-value-added businesses. 
Another reason is the quality of Spanish education, which seems to be declining. William Chislett, of the Royal Elcano Institute, a think-tank, points out that one in three secondary pupils now drops out, double the EU average, and that 70% of 14- and 15-year-olds in Madrid fail their maths exams. Teachers complain that their profession has lost status. School management has been transferred to regional governments without introducing national standards or a national inspection system. The debate about schooling in the past four years has been mainly about Mr Zapatero's insistence on civics lessons, which many feel is a side issue.
The state of the universities is little better. Spain has three world-class business schools, IESE, IE and ESADE, all privately run. But no Spanish university appears in the list of the world's top 150 compiled by Shanghai's Jiao Tong University. Spain's public universities, which make up the vast majority, are trapped in a rigid, bureaucratic system that offers few incentives to strive for excellence, says Mr Fernandez of Nebrija University (which is private). Rectors are elected by assemblies of students, professors and administrative staff and are not accountable to anyone else, but in practice they lack the tools to manage their institutions. The result is a paradox. ""Universities have autonomy: they can do whatever they want as long as they do the same as everyone else,"" says Xavier Vives, an economist at IESE. Universities have been handed to Ms Garmendia's new ministry. She agrees that their governance needs reform and that they should be encouraged to specialise. But she may lack the political weight to achieve this.
Productivity faces other constraints as well. For a start there is too much red tape, To make things more complicated, some aspects of the regulation of business are now handled by regional governments. Some parts of Spain, such as Catalonia, have laws to restrict shopping hours and block out-of-town stores, aimed at preserving small food shops (many of which are now run by Chinese immigrants) and preventing suburban sprawl (from which Madrid, more liberal in these matters, now suffers). But this comes at a cost. Jose Luis Escriva, BBVA's chief economist, thinks that such restrictions on retailing are one reason for Spain's higher inflation; he notes that Catalonia tends to have higher inflation and slower growth than Madrid.
Spain has built an impressive network of motorways and high-speed trains, known as AVEs. Mr Zapatero boasts that by 2010 it will have more kilometres of high-speed railway than any other country in Europe, and that every Spaniard will live within 50 kilometres (30 miles) of an AVE station by 2020. The punctual and comfortable AVE links Madrid and Barcelona in just 2 hours and 40 minutes. 
But Spanish companies find that it can cost up to three times as much to get their goods to the French border than from there to Poland, says Jordi Canals, the dean of IESE. That is partly because of Spain's difficult geography, but also because nearly all goods go by road rather than by rail. It would have been more sensible to upgrade the existing railway network for both freight and passenger trains rather than to build the expensive AVE network. A train from Barcelona to Bilbao, for example, takes at least nine hours in grubby carriages built in the 1960s. In theory the AVE network could be used for freight trains at night. The government says it will introduce competition on the railways and privatise RENFE, the state railway company. But nobody expects this to happen soon.
Spaniards as individuals are almost unfailingly friendly and kind. But when they have to serve customers, something strange often happens: they become defensive and unhelpful. The ministers say they hope to use the EU directive on competition in service industries to shake up these industries and expose them to more competition. Ths first step is a bill to cut back red tape for these businesses. Slow justice
They would do well to move on to the judiciary. ""We're still to a large extent in the 19th century,"" says Jose Antonio Martin Pallin, a retired justice of the supreme court. The courts still follow a procedural code dating from 1882. Evidence is mainly in writing, with little oral testimony and many opportunities for delay. A typical civil case can take up to eight years, says Mr Martin. For example, it took ten years for the courts to decide that Marbella's urban-development plan violated environmental-protection laws: this ruling now requires some 30,000 homes to be demolished. 
Things move so slowly partly because of a shortage of judges, but also because the courts have stuck to the relaxed working hours they got used to under the Franco regime. Administrative staff in the higher courts work only in the mornings but are paid for a full day's work. 
Problems in the labour market also bear some of the blame for Spain's low productivity. The country's trade unions are unusually moderate, having learnt that unreasonable wage demands in the 1980s led to unemployment in the early 1990s. Mr Sebastian claims that wages in real terms have not increased over the past decade, despite the rapid growth in employment. That is partly because of reforms introduced by Mr Aznar but mainly because of increased flexibility thanks to immigration. The upshot, though, has been a dual labour market: some 30% of the workforce are governed by temporary contracts and have no job security, whereas the other 70% enjoy protection that makes sacking them expensive and difficult. This arrangement holds down both wages and permanent employment. 
Moreover, permanent workers are used to annual pay increases indexed to inflation under nationally negotiated agreements. A manager at a Spanish industrial company with factories abroad points out that his workers in Germany have agreed to longer hours with no extra pay, and that those in America have accepted a pay increase below the rate of inflation. Unless his Spanish trade unions follow suit, he says, he will have to lay off workers.
The government has begun a ""social dialogue"" with the unions and the private sector. Mr Fidalgo, of the Workers' Commissions, a formerly communist trade union, talks so eloquently about the need to make the economy more competitive that you might mistake him for a World Bank official. But he does not think that labour needs to become more flexible. His main concern is to make sure that the government finds the money to pay unemployment benefit (which it has said it will) and to reform the state employment service. 
Mr Zapatero says that the government will not implement any changes that do not have the support of both unions and business: ""Any reform without that understanding is not very useful."" That suggests the talks may not achieve much. Some firms will doubtless make local agreements with the unions; certain car factories, for example, are imposing shorter working hours. But there is a strong possibility that increased competitiveness will be achieved through job cuts.
Many of the steps required to make the economy more efficient are outlined in the government's 2005 national reform plan, but Mr Zapatero's detractors claim that he has been slow to implement this. Most of the obvious structural reforms had already taken place before he came to office: for example, the central government has little left to privatise. Much of what is now needed involves offering the right incentives--to run universities and schools better, to hire rather than fire workers and to become more efficient. Such reforms are not easy politically, and do not produce quick results, argues a former minister in Mr Aznar's government. He worries that Mr Zapatero is sending the wrong message to Spaniards--""the idea that you don't need to worry, we'll cover your needs"".
In August the prime minister chose a political rally to announce a 6% increase in pensions, even though the government might have done better to husband its reserves to cope with an ageing population now that immigration is tailing off. ""The issue of reforms is not always linked to economic growth, as it should be,"" concedes Mr Solbes. ""The prime minister is more sensitive to the issue of social rights."" Recession may change Mr Zapatero's priorities. But for the moment Spain's best hope of recovery lies with an impressive array of multinational businesses.",230,Spain,"But reforming the old one is just as important
DOWN on the Barcelona waterfront, on what used to be industrial wasteland before the area was developed for the 1992 Olympic games, a striking new building of wood and glass houses the Barcelona Biomedical Research Park. It is a joint venture between the Generalitat, the Barcelona city council and Pompeu Fabra University. Some 800 scientists, about a third of them foreigners, work at the long white benches with their jumble of flasks, instruments and computers. The six different research groups scattered around the building span various aspects of biomedicine, epidemiology and genomics. 
Some EUR 40m of the park's annual budget of EUR 65m comes from research grants. In the past 15 years Spain has risen fast in the world league-table of articles published in scientific journals, to ninth place. Jordi Cami, a neuroscientist who is the research park's founding director, hopes to use ""the glamour of Barcelona"" to attract leading scientists from around the world and compete for talent with London, Singapore and Cambridge, Massachusetts.
No wonder Mr Zapatero came to open the building in August last year. The research park exactly matches his government's idea of Spain's ""new economic model"", in which brainpower is more important than the muscle of building workers or the sun and sand of tourism. To that end he has created a new Ministry of Science and Innovation. The minister, Cristina Garmendia, is a founder of Genetrix, a biotech start-up which she says is about to become the first European company to launch a drug derived from stem cells. 
Public spending on research and development has tripled since 2000. The problem is that private spending is negligible. The answer, says Ms Garmendia, is to build bridges between universities and companies. Spain is poor at turning research into patents and products. Investment in biotech, for instance, is now EUR 60m, up sixfold in eight years, but still only a tenth of the British or German total.
Miguel Sebastian, the industry minister, talks up Spain's growing prowess and potential in a long list of innovative businesses, ranging from renewable energy to aerospace and information technology. In some of these Spain is already a world leader. Take a high-speed train across the meseta, the high plain with hot, arid summers and harsh winters that covers much of Spain, and your eye will be caught by batteries of upturned solar panels along the tracks, tilted to catch the relentless Spanish sun. The mountain ridges that corrugate the meseta are crowned by gigantic wind turbines--an appropriate sight in the land of Don Quixote. 
The renewables industry is subsidised, as it is everywhere, but the country now gets 22% of its electricity from this source, and three of the world's five biggest renewables companies are Spanish. They are developing a world-class network of technologically sophisticated suppliers, and costs are falling as the technology improves. But the country, which has to import all its gas and oil, needs a broader discussion about energy policy. The PP wants an urgent debate on whether to expand nuclear power. Mr Zapatero does not. Plodding productivity
Innovation takes time, and on its own it is not enough: Spain also has to make its existing economy more efficient. ""We need to raise productivity in hotels and retail as well as in biogenetics. We need to do everything better, starting with education and regulation,"" says Mr Rato, who now works for Lazards, an investment bank. 
Productivity growth has traditionally been slow in Spain. According to the OECD, between 1990 and 1997 it averaged just 0.3% a year, a third of what it was in Germany, France and Italy, the three largest euro-area economies. And more recently things have got worse: the OECD reckons that between 1998 and 2006 total factor productivity (ie, the combined effect of labour, capital and technology) actually fell by 0.2% a year. A Spanish government study disagreed, finding that productivity rose during that period, but only by around 0.3% a year, and that half of the country's economic growth came from immigration. Part of the explanation for the poor productivity figures is that many new jobs were in low-value-added businesses. 
Another reason is the quality of Spanish education, which seems to be declining. William Chislett, of the Royal Elcano Institute, a think-tank, points out that one in three secondary pupils now drops out, double the EU average, and that 70% of 14- and 15-year-olds in Madrid fail their maths exams. Teachers complain that their profession has lost status. School management has been transferred to regional governments without introducing national standards or a national inspection system. The debate about schooling in the past four years has been mainly about Mr Zapatero's insistence on civics lessons, which many feel is a side issue.
The state of the universities is little better. Spain has three world-class business schools, IESE, IE and ESADE, all privately run. But no Spanish university appears in the list of the world's top 150 compiled by Shanghai's Jiao Tong University. Spain's public universities, which make up the vast majority, are trapped in a rigid, bureaucratic system that offers few incentives to strive for excellence, says Mr Fernandez of Nebrija University (which is private). Rectors are elected by assemblies of students, professors and administrative staff and are not accountable to anyone else, but in practice they lack the tools to manage their institutions.

It is the world's seventh-biggest foreign investor. It has two of the 20 biggest banks, and it has made a good job of regulating its banking system (see our special report in this issue). Like the United States, Britain and Ireland, Spain has seen a runaway housing boom turn to bust over the past year. Unlike them, none of its banks has yet had to be bailed out. Indeed, Banco Santander has been shovelling up banking roadkill in Britain and the United States. 
So Spain has something to say in any discussion about global finance.

Until recently it was creating one of every three new jobs in the euro area. But too many of those jobs involved building more than a third of all the new houses started each year in the euro zone. The housing bust at home, as much as the financial turmoil abroad, has sent Spain skidding towards recession. For an economy that has been growing at close to 4% a year for a decade, this is a painful experience. Already this year unemployment has shot up by 750,000 to 2.8m, or 12.3% of the workforce.
After initially downplaying it, Mr Zapatero has responded reasonably effectively to the slowdown.

THE past few months have been bittersweet for Spain. In a general election in March the Socialist Party won a clear but not overwhelming victory, giving Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero a second term as prime minister. That seemed to drain some of the partisan poison that had accumulated in the political system over the previous four years. In June Spain shook off its long-standing reputation as the permanent under-achiever of world football, winning the European championship with swift and skilful attacking play. Not only did the performance of its young team (featuring Catalans as well as the usual Madrilenos in prominent positions) seem to echo Spain's flowering of creativity in everything from architecture to gastronomy; many commentators saw the footballers' triumph and the public's rapturous response to it as a welcome expression of national unity in a country that seemed to be turning increasingly fissiparous. In July Rafael Nadal, a tennis genius from Mallorca, won the Wimbledon championship. At the moment of victory he scampered across the press-box roof, clutching the national flag, to salute Spain's crown prince and his wife. 
But every month since the election the news at home has become gloomier. Investment is slumping. Unemployment in August was 11.3%, a third higher than a year earlier, the biggest jump for 30 years. The economy grew by just 0.1% between the first and the second quarters of this year, the slowest pace since 1993. It is now almost certainly contracting. So sharp was the deterioration that Mr Zapatero (pictured above with Pedro Solbes, his finance minister), who had earlier refused to acknowledge that there was any economic crisis, interrupted his August break to hold an emergency cabinet meeting. ""Spaniards went on holiday in party mood and came back to find there was no champagne left, nor even any decent wine,"" sums up Fernando Fernandez, a former IMF official who is now rector of Nebrija University near Madrid. Great while it lasted
The fiesta had indeed been splendid. Spain has undergone an extraordinary transformation since Francisco Franco died in 1975 and his long dictatorship came to an end. Democracy was swiftly consolidated. A deeply conservative Catholic society has metamorphosed into an almost self-consciously tolerant one. In the 1960s two-fifths of Spaniards still toiled on the land, many of them living in poverty. Now only 5% work in agriculture. Spain has become a vibrant, middle-class urban society.
Social and political change went hand in hand with economic progress. Between 1994 and 2007 the economy grew at an average annual rate of 3.6%. During that period unemployment fell from 24% to 8%, even though many women joined the labour force and some 5m immigrants arrived--and were absorbed with scarcely any sign of tension. For most of the past decade Spain has been responsible for creating about one in every three new jobs in the euro zone. By 2007 total employment had risen to 20m, from only 12m in 1993. When Spain joined the forerunner of the European Union in 1986 its income per person was only 68% of the club's average; in 2007 its income per person was 90% of that of the 15 EU members before its latest expansion. Living standards are now higher than Italy's. 
The improvement in Spaniards' lives is instantly visible. Many elderly people are short, stunted by the hunger they suffered as children in the hard years of fascist autarky after Franco won the civil war of 1936-39. Young Spaniards are strikingly taller than their grandparents, exemplified by Pau Gasol, who measures seven feet (2.13 metres) and was voted the most valuable player when Spain won the latest world basketball championship.
Spain is not just a desirable place to live--though it is that, attracting northern Europeans who have bought second homes in order to enjoy the Spanish combination of sun, good public services and a relaxed way of life. In 2006 it was the world's ninth-largest economy measured at market exchange rates and the twelfth-largest at purchasing-power parity. It is the sixth-biggest net investor abroad.
The economic boom began under Franco, who abandoned autarky in the late 1950s. He turned the management of the economy over to technocrats from Opus Dei, a lay Catholic organisation, who opened it to foreign trade and investment. But a bigger change came in 1986 when Felipe Gonzalez, a Socialist prime minister, led Spain into Europe. Foreign direct investment flooded in as multinationals set up car and other factories to take advantage of relatively low wages. The euro effect
Money from Brussels also poured in. Spain has been the largest single beneficiary of EU regional funds. It has received a total of EUR 186 billion, most of which was wisely spent on improving roads and railways. Under Mr Gonzalez's successor, Jose Maria Aznar of the conservative People's Party (PP), Spain qualified to join the euro at its inception in 1999. Interest rates fell dramatically: the cost of mortgages, for example, came down from 18% to below 5%, unleashing a housing boom.
Yet with a suddenness that has taken officials by surprise, economic boom has turned to bust. When the European Central Bank raised interest rates last year, the housing bubble burst. Higher oil prices also cut disposable income, as well as pushing inflation to a new high of 5.3% in July. And international financial turmoil has caused a credit squeeze at home. 
Mr Zapatero points out that so far Spain has fared no worse than several other large European economies, and that the country's financial system is stronger than that of many of its counterparts: to date, no Spanish bank has got into difficulties. In an interview for this special report Mr Zapatero conceded that the economy faces a period of stagnation, but insisted that ""once calm returns to the international system, we will return to growth without the Spanish economy having suffered structural damage."" The government forecasts that after a year of almost no growth a recovery will start towards the end of 2009. 
This strikes many as far too optimistic. Economists and businesspeople complain that the government was slow to respond to the economy's swift descent into recession. One of the country's most experienced bankers reckons that even if the outside world rights itself fairly quickly, recovery will not begin for at least two years. Some are even more pessimistic, arguing that in addition to the liquidity squeeze and the housing bust Spain suffers from an underlying lack of competitiveness. The symptoms are a current-account deficit that topped 10% of GDP in the first half of this year and an inflation rate that has been about one percentage point higher than the average for the euro zone for most of the past decade. 
Fixing this will not be easy. When recession struck in the past, as it did in the early 1980s and again in 1993, the key to recovery was devaluation. But with Spain in the euro that option is no longer available. Unless the government rams through structural reforms to make the economy more competitive, the argument goes, adjustment to a harsher economic environment will involve a big rise in unemployment and years of stagnation. Instead of going into a V-shaped recession, with a swift recovery, the economy could be heading for an L-shaped depression. 
Spain's prosperity is due partly to good luck, in the form of EU entry. But for most of the past 30 years it has also managed its affairs far better than its southern Mediterranean peers have done. Despite some corruption, particularly in local government, Spanish politics is generally fairly clean. The country's economy is relatively open and flexible--halfway between Britain and the rest of continental Europe. Economic management has been mostly competent and stable: since 1993 Spain has had just two finance ministers (Italy has had four since 2001 alone). Mr Solbes, who has held the job since 2004, had an earlier spell in 1993-96 under Mr Gonzalez before moving on to become the EU's commissioner for economic and monetary affairs. Under Mr Aznar the incumbent was Rodrigo Rato, who subsequently became the IMF's boss. 
Officials reel off other reasons why Spain is now a different and stronger country than it was when recession last struck. For example, in 1993 the government had a budget deficit of 7% of GDP; in 2007 it had a surplus of 2.2% and public debt was just 36.2% of GDP, down from a peak of 68% in 1996 (compared with Italy's figure of 104% in 2007 or Britain's of 44%). Even more importantly, over the past 15 years a clutch of powerful Spanish multinationals has emerged. In 2000 the Financial Times list of the world's 500 biggest firms by market capitalisation included only eight from Spain; by 2008 the figure had risen to 14.
A generation of young Spaniards that has grown up knowing nothing but rapid economic growth may now have to contend with unemployment. This will put Spain's political system, as well as its economy, to its most severe test since the early years of its transition to democracy. This special report will weigh the country's strengths and weaknesses and assess its prospects for renewed economic growth. It will argue that Spain can avoid Italy's fate of seemingly remorseless decline. But there are some grounds for concern in politics, the subject of the next article.",230,Spain,"After three decades of partying, Spain has woken up with a hangover. Curing it will require changes, writes Michael Reid
THE past few months have been bittersweet for Spain. In a general election in March the Socialist Party won a clear but not overwhelming victory, giving Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero a second term as prime minister. That seemed to drain some of the partisan poison that had accumulated in the political system over the previous four years. In June Spain shook off its long-standing reputation as the permanent under-achiever of world football, winning the European championship with swift and skilful attacking play. Not only did the performance of its young team (featuring Catalans as well as the usual Madrilenos in prominent positions) seem to echo Spain's flowering of creativity in everything from architecture to gastronomy; many commentators saw the footballers' triumph and the public's rapturous response to it as a welcome expression of national unity in a country that seemed to be turning increasingly fissiparous. In July Rafael Nadal, a tennis genius from Mallorca, won the Wimbledon championship. At the moment of victory he scampered across the press-box roof, clutching the national flag, to salute Spain's crown prince and his wife. 
But every month since the election the news at home has become gloomier. Investment is slumping. Unemployment in August was 11.3%, a third higher than a year earlier, the biggest jump for 30 years. The economy grew by just 0.1% between the first and the second quarters of this year, the slowest pace since 1993. It is now almost certainly contracting. So sharp was the deterioration that Mr Zapatero (pictured above with Pedro Solbes, his finance minister), who had earlier refused to acknowledge that there was any economic crisis, interrupted his August break to hold an emergency cabinet meeting. ""Spaniards went on holiday in party mood and came back to find there was no champagne left, nor even any decent wine,"" sums up Fernando Fernandez, a former IMF official who is now rector of Nebrija University near Madrid. Great while it lasted
The fiesta had indeed been splendid. Spain has undergone an extraordinary transformation since Francisco Franco died in 1975 and his long dictatorship came to an end. Democracy was swiftly consolidated. A deeply conservative Catholic society has metamorphosed into an almost self-consciously tolerant one. In the 1960s two-fifths of Spaniards still toiled on the land, many of them living in poverty. Now only 5% work in agriculture. Spain has become a vibrant, middle-class urban society.
Social and political change went hand in hand with economic progress. Between 1994 and 2007 the economy grew at an average annual rate of 3.6%. During that period unemployment fell from 24% to 8%, even though many women joined the labour force and some 5m immigrants arrived--and were absorbed with scarcely any sign of tension. For most of the past decade Spain has been responsible for creating about one in every three new jobs in the euro zone. By 2007 total employment had risen to 20m, from only 12m in 1993. When Spain joined the forerunner of the European Union in 1986 its income per person was only 68% of the club's average; in 2007 its income per person was 90% of that of the 15 EU members before its latest expansion. Living standards are now higher than Italy's. 
The improvement in Spaniards' lives is instantly visible. Many elderly people are short, stunted by the hunger they suffered as children in the hard years of fascist autarky after Franco won the civil war of 1936-39. Young Spaniards are strikingly taller than their grandparents, exemplified by Pau Gasol, who measures seven feet (2.13 metres) and was voted the most valuable player when Spain won the latest world basketball championship.
Spain is not just a desirable place to live--though it is that, attracting northern Europeans who have bought second homes in order to enjoy the Spanish combination of sun, good public services and a relaxed way of life. In 2006 it was the world's ninth-largest economy measured at market exchange rates and the twelfth-largest at purchasing-power parity. It is the sixth-biggest net investor abroad.
The economic boom began under Franco, who abandoned autarky in the late 1950s. He turned the management of the economy over to technocrats from Opus Dei, a lay Catholic organisation, who opened it to foreign trade and investment. But a bigger change came in 1986 when Felipe Gonzalez, a Socialist prime minister, led Spain into Europe. Foreign direct investment flooded in as multinationals set up car and other factories to take advantage of relatively low wages. The euro effect
Money from Brussels also poured in. Spain has been the largest single beneficiary of EU regional funds. It has received a total of EUR 186 billion, most of which was wisely spent on improving roads and railways. Under Mr Gonzalez's successor, Jose Maria Aznar of the conservative People's Party (PP), Spain qualified to join the euro at its inception in 1999. Interest rates fell dramatically: the cost of mortgages, for example, came down from 18% to below 5%, unleashing a housing boom.
Yet with a suddenness that has taken officials by surprise, economic boom has turned to bust. When the European Central Bank raised interest rates last year, the housing bubble burst. Higher oil prices also cut disposable income, as well as pushing inflation to a new high of 5.3% in July. And international financial turmoil has caused a credit squeeze at home. 
Mr Zapatero points out that so far Spain has fared no worse than several other large European economies, and that the country's financial system is stronger than that of many of its counterparts: to date, no Spanish bank has got into difficulties. In an interview for this special report Mr Zapatero conceded that the economy faces a period of stagnation, but insisted that ""once calm returns to the international system, we will return to growth without the Spanish economy having suffered structural damage."" The government forecasts that after a year of almost no growth a recovery will start towards the end of 2009.

That sounds like a continuation of the Lisbon Agenda pushed by Mr Aznar, though Mr Zapatero has seemed keener on the (unrelated) Lisbon Treaty, which strengthens the Brussels institutions.

SIR JOHN ELLIOTT, a British historian and the foremost authority on Spain's imperial apogee in the 16th and 17th centuries, delivered a paper at Santander's Menendez Pelayo University this summer in which he ventured that ""the period between 1975 and 2000 may come to be seen in retrospect as a golden age of Spanish history."" He went on to say that the past eight years ""have seen the falling of shadows over what for a quarter of a century had seemed to be an increasingly sunny landscape"". The shadows include polarisation, the re-emergence of dogmatism and ""narrow-minded nationalism and localism"". 
When Franco died, politicians across the political spectrum were determined to seek deals that would avoid the mistakes of the past. They blamed political maximalism from both right and left for plunging the country into the bloodletting of the civil war and its aftermath of repression in which about 600,000 people died. The constitution promulgated in December 1978 was preceded by a broad amnesty and contained some historic compromises. The left accepted a parliamentary monarchy instead of seeking to restore the Second Republic snuffed out by Franco. The right agreed to devolution for the Basque country, Catalonia and Galicia, which it had opposed (and annulled) in the 1930s. 
A short-lived centrist grouping called the UCD governed during the transition and in 1981 survived the only serious coup attempt by diehard franquistas. Mr Gonzalez, who was in office from 1982 to 1996, established a modern welfare state and began to shut down or privatise Franco's rusting state-owned steel works, shipyards and mining industries. In its final years Mr Gonzalez's government was beset by corruption scandals. In a politically charged atmosphere dubbed crispacion (roughly, ""exasperated irritation""), he turned to the conservative Catalan nationalists of Convergencia i Unio (CiU) for support. 
The victory of Mr Aznar's People's Party (PP), which brought together former franquistas, liberals and much of the UCD, was an important milestone for the new democracy. It seemed to show that the right had embraced modern democratic conservatism. Lacking a majority, Mr Aznar allied with CiU and kept many of the Socialists' policies, adding tax and labour reforms. He also took a firm line against the terrorists of ETA (Euskadi Ta Askatasuna, or Basque country and Liberty), who had nearly killed him in a bomb attack in 1995. 
Things began to change in Mr Aznar's second term when he had won an absolute majority and became increasingly high-handed. He secured a ban on parties that sympathised with ETA and treated the conservative Catalan and Basque nationalists with cold hostility. He backed President George Bush's war in Iraq with troops, even though polls showed that 90% of Spaniards opposed this. In a crowning moment of hubris he held his daughter's wedding at El Escorial, the monastery-palace of Spanish monarchs in the golden age to which Sir John Elliott harked back. Bombshell election
To his credit, Mr Aznar stuck to his promise to step down after two terms. As his successor he chose Mariano Rajoy, a decent but plodding politician who seemed unlikely to overshadow him, rather than Mr Rato, his brilliant finance minister. Even so, the PP seemed set to win the 2004 election. But three days before the vote ten bombs exploded simultaneously on several Madrid commuter trains, killing 191 people and injuring more than 2,000 in the country's worst-ever terrorist attack. Mr Aznar tried to pin the blame on ETA. When it quickly became clear that the perpetrators were Islamist extremists, many Spaniards were outraged at this deceit--and confirmed in their view that the Iraq venture had made the country vulnerable. A huge turnout of voters gave the Socialists under their new leader, Mr Zapatero, a narrow and wholly unexpected victory.
Mr Zapatero represented a new generation whose political lives had not been shaped by dictatorship. Aged 43 when he became prime minister, he had been a schoolboy in Leon, in northern Castile, when Franco died. He had worked his way up the local party machine before narrowly winning the leadership of the Socialist Party against its grandees at a congress in 2000. Often derided as a lightweight, he has benefited from being underestimated by his opponents. The PP found it hard to accept its 2004 defeat and not to see him as an accidental prime minister or even a usurper. But Mr Zapatero has shown himself to be a skilled political tactician with a ruthless appreciation of power that has given him an iron grip over his own party. 
In office he has kept his predecessors' macroeconomic policies, but in other ways pursued a different agenda. He began by fulfilling his campaign promise to withdraw the troops from Iraq, which earned him the enmity of Mr Bush. At home he stressed what he calls ""the expansion of freedoms"". His cabinets, in which Mr Solbes is one of the few survivors from Mr Gonzalez's day, have contained many women--a demonstration of his commitment to equality of the sexes. Other reforms allowed for quick divorces and same-sex marriage, encouraged stem-cell research, penalised domestic violence and promised public money for the care of elderly or disabled people. All these measures ""strengthen the idea of citizenship"" and make for a ""more creative, more tolerant society"", says Mr Zapatero. 
Most Spaniards agree with him. But the measures provoked the conservative bishops who head the Catholic church into protests against the government. Mr Rajoy, smarting from his election defeat, was happy to support them. Mr Zapatero thus manoeuvred the PP into portraying itself as more reactionary than the average Spaniard--and perhaps than it really is.
He took three more controversial steps which his detractors (and not just on the right) see as undermining the tacit understandings behind the constitutional settlement. The first was to challenge the ""pact of silence"", as some on the left call it, and reopen debate about the dictatorship. A law approved in 2007 offers government help and money for the relatives of those killed by the Franco regime, often dumped in unmarked graves, to find and rebury their dead. It also calls for all plaques commemorating the old regime to be removed from public buildings. Its supporters say that the law reflects the increasing maturity and self-confidence of Spanish democracy. It righted a clear wrong. The 60,000 or so civilians murdered by Republicans had long since been honoured. Some 150,000 executed by the victors during or after the war had not. 
In the mid-1970s the priority for most Spaniards was to turn their back on dictatorship rather than to seek truth, justice or reconciliation. The attempt in 1998 by Baltazar Garzon, a maverick magistrate, to seek to extradite Chile's dictator, Augusto Pinochet, for crimes against humanity proved the catalyst for a shift in attitudes. Mr Garzon's initiative laid Spain open to the charge of hypocrisy, since none of Franco's officials had been held to account. It also prompted a new generation--the grandchildren of those who fought in the war--to organise civic groups that began to search for and dig up graves. In October Mr Garzon charged Franco and 34 of his (equally dead) henchmen with crimes against humanity. This may open the way for charges against others who are still alive. Many lawyers believe that Mr Garzon is on shaky legal ground.
It is to Mr Zapatero's credit that nobody now disputes that relatives should have the right to honour and rebury their dead. But some charge him with trying to politicise the issue. Many historians deny that the transition to democracy involved a ""pact of silence"". Juan Pablo Fusi, of the Ortega Institute, a postgraduate school, points out that the past 30 years have seen a deluge of detailed research, conferences, debates and television programmes on every aspect of the war and the repression. 
Many feel uncomfortable with the idea that the state is upholding a particular view of the war which ascribes all fault to Franco's nationalists and none to the communists and anarchists who also committed atrocities and undermined the republic. Fernando Savater, a philosopher who was jailed under the dictatorship for his political activity, notes acidly that the law is trying ""to win the civil war now"" and that ""today Franco has many more opponents than when he was alive."" Unruly fringes
Even more controversial was Mr Zapatero's attempt to seek peace with ETA. The group has killed more than 800 people since 1968, but it has been greatly reduced, in numbers and in potency, by effective police work. Co-operation with France has denied its leaders their traditional refuge over the border. The March 2004 bombings caused widespread public outrage at terrorism. Two years later ETA declared a ""permanent ceasefire"". Talks took place between Patxi Lopez, the Socialist leader in the Basque country, and Arnoldo Otegi, the leader of Batasuna, ETA's banned political wing, but they got nowhere.
The government rightly insists that it cannot make political concessions in return for an end to violence. It can negotiate about ETA's 600 prisoners (200 more are in French jails), but only with great caution. Public opinion, prompted by well-organised victims' associations, objects to early release for murderers. Conversely, officials say that Mr Otegi proved to have no sway over ETA's leaders. The government did allow a party of the ""patriotic left"" (the Orwellian term that ETA's political sympathisers use to describe themselves) to take part in municipal elections in 2007, and it got 7.4% of the vote in the three Basque provinces. But by then ETA had broken the truce: without any warning, a car bomb at Madrid's Barajas airport killed two Ecuadorean immigrants in December 2006. 
Both Mr Gonzalez and Mr Aznar had sought a negotiated peace with ETA, only to be similarly frustrated. But they had done so with the opposition's consent. This time the PP angrily accused Mr Zapatero of breaking an anti-terrorist pact between the two parties. As for ETA, officials say its violence is now rejected by many of its traditional supporters. ""That suggests that one day it will end, and we are closer to the end than five years ago,"" says Alfonso Perez Rubalcaba, the interior minister. 
It is Mr Zapatero's entanglements with the legal nationalists of Catalonia (see map in next article), rather than with ETA, that will have a lasting effect. A few years ago some Socialists feared that Mr Aznar's PP had secured a long lease on power through economic success and alliance with CiU. The Socialists responded by moving closer to the nationalists. The Socialist leader in Catalonia, Pasqual Maragall, allied with Esquerra Republicana (ERC), a pro-independence party previously shunned because it rejects the Spanish constitution. This allowed the Socialists to take power in the region in 2003. 
In office, the Catalan Socialist Party has shown itself to be as nationalist as the nationalists themselves. Mr Maragall demanded--and Mr Zapatero agreed to--the renegotiation of Catalonia's 1979 autonomy statute. The new statute, in a convoluted preamble, nods in the direction of recognising Catalonia as a nation, grants it privileged status within Spain and gives it more money and power. That has pleased many politicians in Catalonia. Seen from the rest of Spain, it looks at best unnecessary--Jordi Pujol, the CiU leader who headed Catalonia's regional government for 23 years, never pushed for it--and at worst another stride down a slippery slope that will end in the country's disintegration. In protest, some Madrilenos even mounted a brief boycott of cava, the Catalan sparkling wine. The head of the army spoke out against the statute and was fired, in the first instance of military dissent for a quarter of a century.
Maria Dolores de Cospedal, the PP's general secretary, argues that some points in the new statute violate the constitution. It has yet to be approved by the Constitutional Tribunal. That body enjoys little prestige and includes few constitutional lawyers. Moreover, it has been paralysed for two years by a wrangle between the two main parties over the nomination of new tribunal members. Perhaps the biggest worry about the Catalan statute is that a measure of constitutional significance did not have bipartisan backing and appears to have been introduced for party-political advantage. Victor Perez Diaz, a sociologist at Madrid's Complutense University, says that Mr Zapatero's Socialists ""have crossed a line. They've broken the spirit of the rules but not the rules.""
The Catalan statute proved to be good politics. Mr Zapatero won his second term in March this year thanks to an overwhelming vote in Catalonia. As Ms de Cospedal points out, the PP outpolled the Socialists elsewhere. Mr Zapatero also did well among younger voters, who like his ""expansion of freedoms""--and were left cold by Mr Rajoy. But despite four years of strong economic growth, Mr Zapatero did not win an absolute majority in the lower house of parliament. It was the nationalist parties, notably ERC, that were the main losers in the election. A senior official cites this as a vindication of the government's strategy of, in effect, killing nationalism with kindness (although that is not quite how he puts it).
Mr Rajoy did enough to cling on as the PP's leader, despite having lost two elections. At a party congress in June he replaced Mr Aznar's right-wing friends with new, younger and more centrist leaders, including Ms de Cospedal. He also hinted that it was time to drop crispacion in favour of seeking consensus on some of the big issues facing Spain. In future Mr Zapatero may find the PP harder to provoke. The Socialists are talking about a new abortion law which their chief whip, Jose Antonio Alonso, calls the ""biggest challenge"" of this legislature. The PP thinks the existing law, which allows abortion in quite narrowly defined circumstances, should be properly applied rather than changed. 
But according to Ms de Cospedal, in future her party will concentrate its attack on the economy. Mr Zapatero knows that he is in for a tougher four years than his first. ""The first term was economically easy but politically difficult. This term will be politically easier but economically more difficult,"" he acknowledges. The chances are that he will face trouble on both fronts.

SIR JOHN ELLIOTT, a British historian and the foremost authority on Spain's imperial apogee in the 16th and 17th centuries, delivered a paper at Santander's Menendez Pelayo University this summer in which he ventured that ""the period between 1975 and 2000 may come to be seen in retrospect as a golden age of Spanish history."" He went on to say that the past eight years ""have seen the falling of shadows over what for a quarter of a century had seemed to be an increasingly sunny landscape"". The shadows include polarisation, the re-emergence of dogmatism and ""narrow-minded nationalism and localism"". 
When Franco died, politicians across the political spectrum were determined to seek deals that would avoid the mistakes of the past. They blamed political maximalism from both right and left for plunging the country into the bloodletting of the civil war and its aftermath of repression in which about 600,000 people died. The constitution promulgated in December 1978 was preceded by a broad amnesty and contained some historic compromises. The left accepted a parliamentary monarchy instead of seeking to restore the Second Republic snuffed out by Franco. The right agreed to devolution for the Basque country, Catalonia and Galicia, which it had opposed (and annulled) in the 1930s. 
A short-lived centrist grouping called the UCD governed during the transition and in 1981 survived the only serious coup attempt by diehard franquistas. Mr Gonzalez, who was in office from 1982 to 1996, established a modern welfare state and began to shut down or privatise Franco's rusting state-owned steel works, shipyards and mining industries. In its final years Mr Gonzalez's government was beset by corruption scandals. In a politically charged atmosphere dubbed crispacion (roughly, ""exasperated irritation""), he turned to the conservative Catalan nationalists of Convergencia i Unio (CiU) for support. 
The victory of Mr Aznar's People's Party (PP), which brought together former franquistas, liberals and much of the UCD, was an important milestone for the new democracy. It seemed to show that the right had embraced modern democratic conservatism. Lacking a majority, Mr Aznar allied with CiU and kept many of the Socialists' policies, adding tax and labour reforms. He also took a firm line against the terrorists of ETA (Euskadi Ta Askatasuna, or Basque country and Liberty), who had nearly killed him in a bomb attack in 1995. 
Things began to change in Mr Aznar's second term when he had won an absolute majority and became increasingly high-handed. He secured a ban on parties that sympathised with ETA and treated the conservative Catalan and Basque nationalists with cold hostility. He backed President George Bush's war in Iraq with troops, even though polls showed that 90% of Spaniards opposed this. In a crowning moment of hubris he held his daughter's wedding at El Escorial, the monastery-palace of Spanish monarchs in the golden age to which Sir John Elliott harked back. Bombshell election
To his credit, Mr Aznar stuck to his promise to step down after two terms. As his successor he chose Mariano Rajoy, a decent but plodding politician who seemed unlikely to overshadow him, rather than Mr Rato, his brilliant finance minister. Even so, the PP seemed set to win the 2004 election. But three days before the vote ten bombs exploded simultaneously on several Madrid commuter trains, killing 191 people and injuring more than 2,000 in the country's worst-ever terrorist attack. Mr Aznar tried to pin the blame on ETA. When it quickly became clear that the perpetrators were Islamist extremists, many Spaniards were outraged at this deceit--and confirmed in their view that the Iraq venture had made the country vulnerable. A huge turnout of voters gave the Socialists under their new leader, Mr Zapatero, a narrow and wholly unexpected victory.
Mr Zapatero represented a new generation whose political lives had not been shaped by dictatorship. Aged 43 when he became prime minister, he had been a schoolboy in Leon, in northern Castile, when Franco died. He had worked his way up the local party machine before narrowly winning the leadership of the Socialist Party against its grandees at a congress in 2000. Often derided as a lightweight, he has benefited from being underestimated by his opponents. The PP found it hard to accept its 2004 defeat and not to see him as an accidental prime minister or even a usurper. But Mr Zapatero has shown himself to be a skilled political tactician with a ruthless appreciation of power that has given him an iron grip over his own party. 
In office he has kept his predecessors' macroeconomic policies, but in other ways pursued a different agenda. He began by fulfilling his campaign promise to withdraw the troops from Iraq, which earned him the enmity of Mr Bush. At home he stressed what he calls ""the expansion of freedoms"". His cabinets, in which Mr Solbes is one of the few survivors from Mr Gonzalez's day, have contained many women--a demonstration of his commitment to equality of the sexes. Other reforms allowed for quick divorces and same-sex marriage, encouraged stem-cell research, penalised domestic violence and promised public money for the care of elderly or disabled people. All these measures ""strengthen the idea of citizenship"" and make for a ""more creative, more tolerant society"", says Mr Zapatero. 
Most Spaniards agree with him. But the measures provoked the conservative bishops who head the Catholic church into protests against the government. Mr Rajoy, smarting from his election defeat, was happy to support them. Mr Zapatero thus manoeuvred the PP into portraying itself as more reactionary than the average Spaniard--and perhaps than it really is.
He took three more controversial steps which his detractors (and not just on the right) see as undermining the tacit understandings behind the constitutional settlement. The first was to challenge the ""pact of silence"", as some on the left call it, and reopen debate about the dictatorship. A law approved in 2007 offers government help and money for the relatives of those killed by the Franco regime, often dumped in unmarked graves, to find and rebury their dead. It also calls for all plaques commemorating the old regime to be removed from public buildings. Its supporters say that the law reflects the increasing maturity and self-confidence of Spanish democracy. It righted a clear wrong. The 60,000 or so civilians murdered by Republicans had long since been honoured. Some 150,000 executed by the victors during or after the war had not. 
In the mid-1970s the priority for most Spaniards was to turn their back on dictatorship rather than to seek truth, justice or reconciliation. The attempt in 1998 by Baltazar Garzon, a maverick magistrate, to seek to extradite Chile's dictator, Augusto Pinochet, for crimes against humanity proved the catalyst for a shift in attitudes. Mr Garzon's initiative laid Spain open to the charge of hypocrisy, since none of Franco's officials had been held to account. It also prompted a new generation--the grandchildren of those who fought in the war--to organise civic groups that began to search for and dig up graves. In October Mr Garzon charged Franco and 34 of his (equally dead) henchmen with crimes against humanity. This may open the way for charges against others who are still alive. Many lawyers believe that Mr Garzon is on shaky legal ground.
It is to Mr Zapatero's credit that nobody now disputes that relatives should have the right to honour and rebury their dead. But some charge him with trying to politicise the issue. Many historians deny that the transition to democracy involved a ""pact of silence"". Juan Pablo Fusi, of the Ortega Institute, a postgraduate school, points out that the past 30 years have seen a deluge of detailed research, conferences, debates and television programmes on every aspect of the war and the repression. 
Many feel uncomfortable with the idea that the state is upholding a particular view of the war which ascribes all fault to Franco's nationalists and none to the communists and anarchists who also committed atrocities and undermined the republic. Fernando Savater, a philosopher who was jailed under the dictatorship for his political activity, notes acidly that the law is trying ""to win the civil war now"" and that ""today Franco has many more opponents than when he was alive."" Unruly fringes
Even more controversial was Mr Zapatero's attempt to seek peace with ETA. The group has killed more than 800 people since 1968, but it has been greatly reduced, in numbers and in potency, by effective police work. Co-operation with France has denied its leaders their traditional refuge over the border. The March 2004 bombings caused widespread public outrage at terrorism. Two years later ETA declared a ""permanent ceasefire"". Talks took place between Patxi Lopez, the Socialist leader in the Basque country, and Arnoldo Otegi, the leader of Batasuna, ETA's banned political wing, but they got nowhere.
The government rightly insists that it cannot make political concessions in return for an end to violence. It can negotiate about ETA's 600 prisoners (200 more are in French jails), but only with great caution. Public opinion, prompted by well-organised victims' associations, objects to early release for murderers. Conversely, officials say that Mr Otegi proved to have no sway over ETA's leaders. The government did allow a party of the ""patriotic left"" (the Orwellian term that ETA's political sympathisers use to describe themselves) to take part in municipal elections in 2007, and it got 7.4% of the vote in the three Basque provinces. But by then ETA had broken the truce: without any warning, a car bomb at Madrid's Barajas airport killed two Ecuadorean immigrants in December 2006. 
Both Mr Gonzalez and Mr Aznar had sought a negotiated peace with ETA, only to be similarly frustrated. But they had done so with the opposition's consent. This time the PP angrily accused Mr Zapatero of breaking an anti-terrorist pact between the two parties. As for ETA, officials say its violence is now rejected by many of its traditional supporters. ""That suggests that one day it will end, and we are closer to the end than five years ago,"" says Alfonso Perez Rubalcaba, the interior minister. 
It is Mr Zapatero's entanglements with the legal nationalists of Catalonia (see map in next article), rather than with ETA, that will have a lasting effect. A few years ago some Socialists feared that Mr Aznar's PP had secured a long lease on power through economic success and alliance with CiU. The Socialists responded by moving closer to the nationalists. The Socialist leader in Catalonia, Pasqual Maragall, allied with Esquerra Republicana (ERC), a pro-independence party previously shunned because it rejects the Spanish constitution. This allowed the Socialists to take power in the region in 2003. 
In office, the Catalan Socialist Party has shown itself to be as nationalist as the nationalists themselves. Mr Maragall demanded--and Mr Zapatero agreed to--the renegotiation of Catalonia's 1979 autonomy statute. The new statute, in a convoluted preamble, nods in the direction of recognising Catalonia as a nation, grants it privileged status within Spain and gives it more money and power. That has pleased many politicians in Catalonia. Seen from the rest of Spain, it looks at best unnecessary--Jordi Pujol, the CiU leader who headed Catalonia's regional government for 23 years, never pushed for it--and at worst another stride down a slippery slope that will end in the country's disintegration. In protest, some Madrilenos even mounted a brief boycott of cava, the Catalan sparkling wine. The head of the army spoke out against the statute and was fired, in the first instance of military dissent for a quarter of a century.
Maria Dolores de Cospedal, the PP's general secretary, argues that some points in the new statute violate the constitution. It has yet to be approved by the Constitutional Tribunal. That body enjoys little prestige and includes few constitutional lawyers. Moreover, it has been paralysed for two years by a wrangle between the two main parties over the nomination of new tribunal members. Perhaps the biggest worry about the Catalan statute is that a measure of constitutional significance did not have bipartisan backing and appears to have been introduced for party-political advantage. Victor Perez Diaz, a sociologist at Madrid's Complutense University, says that Mr Zapatero's Socialists ""have crossed a line. They've broken the spirit of the rules but not the rules.""

SPANIARDS are not used to housing busts. Since property seemed for so long to be a one-way bet, some still find it hard to grasp that prices can ever fall. Recently 2,000 people spent a chilly night sleeping out to sign up for ""cheap"" new homes due to be built in the Madrid dormitory town of Fuenlabrada. They could have found lower prices on the internet.
The market is dropping fast. Property fairs tout discounts of as much as 60% on new-built homes, or even ""buy one, get one free"" offers. ""All the statistics show a fall,"" concedes the housing minister, Beatriz Corredor. Yet pinning down just how big a fall is tricky. Tax-shy Spaniards do not always declare the true selling prices. The government's main index, based on valuers' estimates, shows a 1.3% nominal fall in the third quarter. Most think the true figure is far bigger. The IESE business school talks of prices of existing homes falling by 8%. 
Private sellers cannot believe that their homes are losing value, according to Fernando Encinar, communications director at idealista.com, a property website. But developers know the game is up. Some deals are being struck at 20% below advertised prices, he says, a fact few developers are keen to broadcast. They do not want people writing off deposits on half-built homes and shopping around for something cheaper.
The huge number of homes still being built makes the outlook even bleaker. Cranes dot the skyline of Madrid's outer suburbs, promising more pain. Spain has been churning out new homes at near-record rates. Figures for new but unsold homes vary from half a million to over 900,000; the number is rising. In July a five-year record 70,691 new homes were finished. Over the first eight months of 2008 429,711 new homes joined the glut. 
Those reassured by the health of Spain's banks have tended to look only at household mortgages. But these are not where the real problem lies. Loan-to-value ratios tend to be safely below 80%. And Spanish mortgages cannot be cancelled by dropping the house keys at the bank: security is provided by all of a borrower's assets--and sometimes those of relatives as well. It is no surprise that most Spaniards do their utmost not to default. 
The real worry for banks concerns their loans to builders and developers. More than 40% of property loans go to them, not to householders. And the numbers considered ""doubtful"" by the Bank of Spain rose by 60% in the second quarter, to reach 2% of all such loans. They now account for more bad loans than do household mortgages. Worse is to come. ""Let no one hope for a price fall of 30-40% because, before that, I'll be giving it all to the bank,"" the head of the Spanish developers' association, Guillermo Chicote, said recently.
Many construction groups are on their knees. The fifth-largest, Habitat, has joined the giant Martinsa-Fadesa among those filing for administration. Metrovacesa and Colonial have fallen partly into their creditors' hands. Another indebted builder, Sacyr Vallehermoso, has just sold its toll-road arm and is in negotiation to sell its holding in Repsol YPF, Spain's big oil company, possibly to Russia's Lukoil.
Plenty of new homes are now being finished, but few are being started. Those Madrid cranes will soon disappear. Construction has until recently accounted for twice as big a share of GDP in Spain as in other big European countries. It is now shrinking fast--and shedding workers. 
The prime minister, Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero, has his eye fixed on unemployment, which rose by over 40% on a year ago to hit almost 3m in November. Spain has Europe's biggest unemployment crisis. The government's latest EUR 11 billion emergency boost is meant to create 300,000 more jobs. But it will not push up property prices. For years Spaniards have grumbled about exorbitant house prices. The market is sorting that one out, at least.

For the million Spanish families who saw a wage-earner lose their job in 2008, Christmas was a lot grimmer. The Spanish economy tends to exaggerate both the glories and the pain of its neighbours. When they grow, it grows faster; when they shrink, it is among the worst-hit. Over this decade it has created more jobs than any other country in Europe; now it is destroying them equally briskly.
The jobless rate is now 13%, over 3m, compared with a European average of 7%. Spain has as many unemployed as Germany, with a population 80% bigger. The future is scarier still: some forecasters talk of 16% unemployment, and Spain's savings banks predict 18% (over 4m people) in 2010. The construction bust is adding extra victims to those of the credit crunch. And for the first time Spain faces recession with a big immigrant population, which has risen eightfold in a decade, to just over 5m.
Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero, the prime minister, has conceded that 2009 will be a ""serious challenge"". But he added optimistically that ""the Spanish economy is in a condition to recover employment because it is strong."" Recovery will start by the end of the year, he predicted. His optimism has not rubbed off on others, starting with the car workers. Just after Christmas, workers from General Motors took to the streets, following a trail blazed by those from Nissan and Renault.

Even trade unions are angry over the opportunities missed in a decade of rapid growth. ""We were walking with feet of clay,"" says Jesus Perez, employment secretary of the General Workers Union.
So what is Mr Zapatero doing? He claims that a EUR 33 billion public-works programme will lead to 25,000 new building projects by May. Spain's low debt burden creates some room for manoeuvre. Yet even a recovery by December will be too late for a first wave of jobless who will by then be running out of their statutory unemployment benefit. Mr Zapatero has pledged to look after them, but that will cost money. The welfare system is less generous than most. Spaniards traditionally fall back on families for support, housing and jobs at times of crisis. But the family nowadays is weaker, smaller and sometimes led by single parents.
Caritas, a church-run charity, saw a 75% rise in requests for help during 2008.

TENS of thousands protested in Zaragoza recently. ""If this isn't fixed, strike! strike! strike!"" they chanted. A city that in 2008 enjoyed the limelight of a World Expo is now one of Spain's most troubled. The protesters show that negative indicators are more than mere numbers. In the country with Europe's highest unemployment rate, jobs have overtaken terrorism as voters' main concern. 
In few places does the social fallout from recession look so dramatic. Predictions keep getting worse. The government expects unemployment to rise from 13% to 16% this year. The ESADE business school predicts 20%. Aragon, the region of which Zaragoza is capital, encapsulates it all. The switch from boom to bust has had a drastic effect. Spain's decade of high growth was especially notable in Aragon, which hit near-full employment in the Expo-building frenzy. ""Now we are among the regions destroying jobs fastest,"" says Julian Buey, a local union leader. ""That is because we created low-skilled work in construction but did not invest in technology.""
The end of the Expo and the car-making crash make things worse. Aragon's government, desperate to save a General Motors factory and its suppliers, has offered GM a EUR 200m ($260m) credit guarantee. It is fighting an uphill battle. Spain is leading car sales down with an annual drop in demand of almost 30%. 
The pain is uneven. Immigrants and the young, many of Aragon's new workers, were the first to be sacked. They have not built up a decent cushion of unemployment benefit. Some 5m foreigners have multiplied Spain's immigrant population eightfold in a decade. Offering them lump-sum payments to go home has not worked. Many young people dropped out of school because jobs were plentiful, says Mr Buey. Now they are both unemployed and uneducated. 
The government in Madrid predicts that GDP will contract by 1.6% this year, and the budget deficit will soar to 6% of GDP. Others are even gloomier. ""We have used up all the leeway we had with public spending,"" admitted Pedro Solbes, the finance minister. Standard & Poor's decision this week to downgrade Spain's credit rating has confirmed the worst. 
The full social impact of the recession will kick in after the summer, when a first wave of jobless run out of unemployment pay and start receiving less generous welfare handouts. The Socialist government of Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero, which was re-elected in March 2008, may then feel more popular discontent. For now claims that things will be rosier at year's end may have lulled some into a false sense of security. Spain's strawberry farmers, in need of pickers, have gone to Morocco to hire thousands of labourers this month. Spaniards had it good for so long that many will not consider low-paid agricultural work. That may change by the time the strawberries need picking again next year.",230,Spain,"The worrying social fallout from sharply rising unemployment
TENS of thousands protested in Zaragoza recently. ""If this isn't fixed, strike! strike! strike!"" they chanted. A city that in 2008 enjoyed the limelight of a World Expo is now one of Spain's most troubled. The protesters show that negative indicators are more than mere numbers. In the country with Europe's highest unemployment rate, jobs have overtaken terrorism as voters' main concern. 
In few places does the social fallout from recession look so dramatic. Predictions keep getting worse. The government expects unemployment to rise from 13% to 16% this year. The ESADE business school predicts 20%. Aragon, the region of which Zaragoza is capital, encapsulates it all. The switch from boom to bust has had a drastic effect. Spain's decade of high growth was especially notable in Aragon, which hit near-full employment in the Expo-building frenzy. ""Now we are among the regions destroying jobs fastest,"" says Julian Buey, a local union leader. ""That is because we created low-skilled work in construction but did not invest in technology.""
The end of the Expo and the car-making crash make things worse. Aragon's government, desperate to save a General Motors factory and its suppliers, has offered GM a EUR 200m ($260m) credit guarantee. It is fighting an uphill battle. Spain is leading car sales down with an annual drop in demand of almost 30%.

AT FIRST, only two podiums were set up for the press conference at the impressively chaotic post-Gaza summit held, on January 18th, in a golf resort in Sharm el-Sheikh: one for Hosni Mubarak, Egypt's president and the host, and one for Nicolas Sarkozy. This did not please the British contingent, whose plane had already been forced to circle above the Sinai peninsula while the French president landed. Then, moments before the soundbites were to be uttered, a phalanx of panicky Egyptians dismantled the podiums and dragged in a dais, some carpets and a long table. Gordon Brown eventually squeezed in between Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero of Spain and Italy's Silvio Berlusconi.
It was a vignette that captured the current pitch of Britain's foreign policy. The country is still at the top table, but not at its centre; it has a role in fresh crises, but mainly, it seems, when the firing has ceased. The slippage is partly due to its prime minister, who lacks the dynamism of his predecessor, Tony Blair, and Mr Sarkozy. But it is a consequence also of Britain's economic recession.
Britain and Mr Brown have so far avoided two of the obvious risks and temptations for foreign policy during slumps: diversionary adventurism and protectionist isolationism. The impact of this downturn is quieter--a kind of quiescence. During the actual fighting in Gaza, for example, although Britain drafted the UN resolution of January 8th, Mr Brown mostly kept his head down. The same was true during last summer's war in Georgia. 
There are some plausible excuses for this low profile. Mr Brown, say his aides, was intimately involved in the Gaza diplomacy, but in private and by telephone. There are hints that he sees Anglo-Franco-German unity as the best way to maximise British influence on some questions. Britain's relations with Russia were perhaps too poisonous for it to broker a peace in Georgia. 
But there have been other indicators of a gentle slide from robustness towards humility. Last autumn Britain softened its view on the European Union's approach to Russia. It also revised its policy on Tibet, explicitly recognising China's sovereignty over the territory, in place of the arcane concept of ""suzerainty"". The Chinese were delighted. This is evidently regarded as a time for Britain to ingratiate itself with big, tricky countries, rather than to irk them. (There is an exception: David Miliband, the foreign secretary, has proved Britain's continuing ability to cause offence, if nothing else, in some parts of the world, by provoking outrage in India with some bald remarks about Kashmir.)
Two domestic shortages help to explain the new modesty. Attention is in short supply: Downing Street is now inevitably concentrating on the economy. Worries about how Mr Brown is perceived to be spending his time may also be involved: he does not want to be seen gallivanting around Arabia conspicuously while the pound plummets and banks totter.
The other shortage is of cash. The government struggled to put its money where Mr Blair's mouth was--to find the resources that the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan needed--even in the fat years. Now it will be harder still to maintain defence spending. That will be true in other countries, too; but few, besides America, have been as militarily active as Britain. Notwithstanding Mr Brown's quaint-sounding offer of British ships to help intercept weapons in the Red Sea and the Gulf of Aden, no other country's military ambition is likely to look so shrunken.
And there is another, related reason for the subtle diminution of Britain's foreign policy. The country's diplomatic clout over the past decade was due not only to Mr Blair's personal oomph. He and Mr Brown, then his chancellor, seemed to other leaders to have found the elixir of electoral victory, as well as of perpetual economic growth. Both bits of the magic have now worn off: as unemployment mounts, Labour is again far behind the Conservatives in the opinion polls. The whiff of forthcoming defeat may dissuade other leaders from embracing Mr Brown too tightly. 
Among them, perhaps, Barack Obama. President Obama is expected in London for the G20 summit in April, to discuss the aspect of international relations in which Mr Brown hopes to lead: reform of the world's financial institutions and the global response to the credit crunch. But he may find Mr Obama--in any case not as obviously Anglophile as most of his recent predecessors--less keen to cultivate him than the prime minister hopes, and drawn to other European leaders who seem more active in world affairs. Britain's reluctance to send more troops to Afghanistan may also disappoint him. If Mr Obama keeps his distance, Britain's weight in the EU and elsewhere will be affected. A period of repose
Diplomacy can be exhausting. Later on January 18th the summiteers reconvened in a chilly marquee at the Jerusalem residence of Israel's prime minister. Now their greatest yen seemed not to go first, but to go to sleep. Mr Berlusconi rambled; Angela Merkel bored; Mr Sarkozy overdid it. It was Mr Brown who struck the right tone--averring support for Israel before urging compromise. 
The widespread view that Mr Brown's only real foreign-policy interests are economic is not absolutely fair. He genuinely cares about Israel--his father, as he recounted last year in a moving speech in that country's parliament, was chairman of the Church of Scotland's Israel committee--and his concern for civilian suffering, especially that of children, seems sincere. He also has a better feel for the nuances of diplomacy than is often credited, or than his occasional awkwardness and malapropisms suggest. He doubtless believes that, under his leadership, Britain can be a force for good; he probably does not see it as part of his prime-ministerial mission to preside over a diplomatic decline. 
Nevertheless, assertive international engagement seems to be a luxury that the country cannot afford in the downturn. The parallel recession in Britain's foreign policy, however, may turn out to have a cost of its own.",230,Spain,"The trajectory of British foreign policy during the recession

EARLY morning at Barcelona's railway station and the platform crowd looks smarter than it would have done a year ago. But these are not ordinary weekday commuters. They are besuited businessmen heading for Madrid, almost 500km (310 miles) away. A sleek new high-speed AVE train will whisk them to the capital at speeds of up to 300kmph in plenty of time for their morning meetings.
The new passengers reflect a revolution in Spanish travel. Domestic airlines have lost a fifth of their passengers in the space of a year. And long-distance trains have gained almost a third.
This shift is the consequence of an ambitious programme for high-speed rail. The streamlined AVE trains, with their sleek corridors, work tables and spectacular views, are stealing the show. Those used to the tedious taxi rides, security checks and crowded shuttle flights traditionally endured by Spanish businessmen will not be surprised. The opening of the Barcelona-Madrid line a year ago marked the beginning of the end of airlines' dominance. In its first ten months it carried 2m passengers; in 2008 its share of the total market rose from 28% to 38%. Josep Valls, of the ESADE business school, predicts that trains will carry most long-distance travellers within two years. 
Spain's high-speed network is still in its infancy. Another 9,000km of lines are planned over the next decade. The aim is to create Europe's most extensive high-speed network, with 90% of Spaniards living within 50km of a station.
Shifting people on to high-speed trains has needed both careful planning and political consensus. When Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero's Socialist government proudly opens new stations, it is often reaping rewards sown by previous administrations. But Mr Zapatero's commitment cannot be faulted. New lines are being built in every corner of the country. Under a recent agreement the network will even be extended into Portugal.
Critics still complain that politics has loomed too large. The first AVE line did not connect Madrid to busy Barcelona but to sleepy Seville, the home town of the then prime minister, Felipe Gonzalez. Even now, whereas small provincial cities like Valladolid and Segovia are connected to a new line, it will still take several years to link up with France's network.
Not everybody loves the train. In Barcelona people fret that its vibrations may topple the Sagrada Familia cathedral. In the Basque Country ETA terrorists have hijacked a campaign against the AVE begun by environmentalists, killing a local contractor who was working on it. Yet the train wins most of the environmental argument. Carbon emissions per passenger are one-sixth as big as for air travellers. High-speed lines also free up existing railways for cargo, keeping lorries off roads.
Prices vary and can be hard to compare. Budget airlines tend still to be the cheapest on the Madrid-Barcelona route. Fernando Conte, chairman of Iberia, Spain's biggest airline, also insists that ""point to point we are quicker."" Yet that assumes aircraft take off on time and there are no traffic jams. Savings on taxi fares plus a 99% punctuality rate are usually enough to push people on to the train. Tellingly enough, Iberia is planning to cut domestic flights by 7% this year.

IN FRANCE railway crossings are adorned with a small lesson for a life of gnomic brevity. ""One train can conceal another,"" is the message printed on warning signs. It is a motto that supporters of free trade should remember as they scan the horizon for threats to the European Union's greatest achievement: the borderless single market. Those watching out for protectionism have plenty to alarm them, right before their eyes. But the biggest threats to the single market are those hidden from view.
Start with the visibly alarming. France's President Nicolas Sarkozy, an express train in human form, has hinted that billions of euros in aid for the French car industry should be made conditional on keeping production in France (and perhaps on buying French-made components, unnamed aides have briefed). There has been no less furious tooting and whistling from politicians in such places as Spain, Britain and Greece as they nag bailed-out bankers to lend first to domestic businesses and households. The Greeks publicly ""advised"" banks to be ""more prudent"" about transferring bail-out funds to Balkan subsidiaries. A nasty industrial dispute, sparked when Italian and Portuguese workers were posted to an English oil refinery, led one British minister to urge changes to EU law to stop foreigners undercutting Brits.
Yet so far, say European Commission officials, most such announcements amount to ""virtual"" protectionism. Politicians thunder about shielding domestic jobs, but in the detail of their plans, they have avoided direct challenges to EU competition and state-aid rules. Linking public funds to a strict ""buy French"" policy for car parts, for example, would clearly be illegal. It would probably be equally illegal to link aid to a nationwide ban on moving production elsewhere in Europe (though regions can link funding to promises to keep specific factories open).
European leaders have not forgotten the lessons of the 1930s, and accept that measures to harm neighbours would trigger a downward spiral of protectionism. Most EU governments are sincerely horrified by the ""Buy American"" provisions added to the Obama administration's stimulus package by Congress. Many governments are frankly short of money, and are wary of subsidy races against each other. All the main political parties in Britain have condemned the current wildcat strikes against foreign labour, and defended the benefits of the free movement of people, goods, capital and services inside the EU.
Yet dangers lurk, even so. This credit crunch will test all sorts of EU disciplines. Last month the commission revived EU export subsidies for dairy products for the first time since 2007, amid falling prices. After a similar plunge in olive-oil prices, Italy wants the stuff added to an EU list of foods that can be bought with public money and given to the poor. Greece is now trying to buy off its protesting farmers with a EUR 500m ($650m) aid package for olives and other crops. The Greek plan could yet fall foul of EU rules: it is presented as an insurance scheme paying out for weather-damaged crops and rising input costs, but the amount is too big.
There are other warning signs that governments are thinking selfishly. There is a reason why every stimulus plan contains infrastructure projects, says one senior official: it minimises the risk of public money leaking to other countries. In contrast, if governments try to boost consumption (say with tax cuts) lots of the extra cash might go on imported goodies. Public works are also pleasingly visible to voters. A list of 1,000 stimulus projects to start this year in France is nothing if not splendidly French. Some 45 cathedrals are to be restored and also several castles, alongside the usual high-speed rail lines and roads. The Spanish government is so proud of a public-works blitz of 32,000 projects that it wants to mark them with red-and-yellow metal signs four metres wide and three metres high.
Yet a cornerstone of the single market is the idea that big public works should be put out to tender across the EU. The philosophy is clear enough. Contests keep local firms competitive and ensure value for money for taxpayers. Now that argument is under strain. Commission officials report political pressure to raise the threshold at which EU-wide tendering must occur, currently EUR 5.15m for public-works projects. France wants the procurement rules tweaked to favour smaller firms. Compete or protect?
Enforcing EU rules is going to become ever more painful. The Spanish prime minister, Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero, has promised that his public-works programme will create 300,000 new jobs, with hiring policies favouring the unemployed. That is allowed. But under EU rules, the jobs cannot be reserved for unemployed locals or Spaniards.
The same goes for British politicians when they talk of stopping foreign posted workers ""undercutting"" British rivals. The truth is that the single market was always intended to bring out the competitive advantages of every corner of the EU. That includes allowing workers from, say, Poland, to offset lower productivity with lower wage costs, as long as minimum European standards were met. Ever since the EU began enlarging to take in poorer members, west European trade unions have been worried about keeping their high levels of social protection. Recent British protests are no surprise: commission officials had long expected action in Britain against foreign workers brought in under the posted workers' directive, a trade union bugbear. 
The single market is firmly in the left's sights. The European Trade Union Confederation, an umbrella body, has drafted a new ""social protocol"" it wants to add to the next EU treaty, saying the single market ""is not an end in itself"", but must be balanced by ""social progress"". That would split the EU between old and new members, and play into the hands of economic nationalists. A great deal is at stake as this crisis deepens. Without a lot of vigilance, the single market could be derailed.",230,Spain,"Recession is bringing fresh threats to Europe's single market

THE Spanish prime minister, Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero, may be presiding over an economy in sharp recession. Yet the opposition People's Party (PP) can scarcely make its criticism heard over the din of its own scandals. 
Polls predict that, despite unemployment running at 14%, Mr Zapatero's Socialists will gain votes in two elections on March 1st for regional governments in Galicia and the Basque country. In Galicia, the Socialists may once again form the government; in the Basque country they may lead it for the first time in 25 years.
That would be a blow to the PP leader, Mariano Rajoy, himself a Galician. He has already lost two general elections and his party, unsurprisingly, seethes with barely contained rebellion. His leadership, ever at risk, has been undermined by a bewildering succession of scandals. A controversial investigating magistrate, Baltasar Garzon, has jailed three businesspeople close to the PP. Newspapers talk of bribes and backhanders to party officials in town halls and regional governments. A former senior PP official in Galicia is now in prison; a PP mayor from Boadilla del Monte, a town near Madrid, and a member of the PP-run Madrid regional government, have resigned; and deals done in Valencia, another region run by the PP, are also under legal scrutiny. 
All this has exposed the intensity of the party's in-fighting. Judge Garzon's investigation was prompted, it is reported, by the recording of a conversation handed in by disgruntled PP members. A secondary scandal, in which senior PP members from Madrid have been spied on, points to almost paranoid mistrust within the party. 
Mr Rajoy denies that any dirty money has gone to the PP's coffers. ""I give my word that the party has not financed itself with this corruption, not that I know of,"" he says. The PP likes to cast itself as victim--of the press, the judge, the government and unscrupulous businessmen. The party's octogenarian founding president, Manuel Fraga, goes one further, citing Judas's betrayal of Jesus. ""If Jesus Christ can have something like that happen with his personnel selection, imagine what mere mortals can do,"" he says. 
Time, and the courts, will reveal the scale of any wrongdoing. The political damage, however, is already apparent. Perhaps most upsetting for PP loyalists are newspaper photographs of three of those under investigation, dressed in tailcoats or gowns, as guests at the wedding of the daughter of Jose Maria Aznar, the former PP prime minister. 
Mr Aznar's eight years in power, ending in 2004, are regarded as the party's high point. There is no suggestion that Mr Aznar is involved in any scandal.

IT HAS been an unhappy week for Spain's vociferous regions. On March 1st the nationalists were ousted from power in Galicia. Even more strikingly, the Basque nationalists lost a 29-year stranglehold on their regional government. Debate over devolution, tinged by the bloody violence of ETA terrorists, has consumed much of Spain's political energy ever since the return of democracy three decades ago. Has the tide now turned?
Before that question can be answered, the Basque confusion needs to be cleared up. Only when votes from abroad are counted, a process that began late this week, will the make-up of the Basque parliament certainly be known. That will decide if the Basque Socialists, whose share of the vote rose by a third, can form a minority government. The foreign vote is unlikely to bring much relief to Juan Jose Ibarretxe, the Basque premier for the past decade. His Basque Nationalist Party (PNV) came out ahead of the Socialists, but his coalition partners were virtually wiped out. For the first time since a Basque parliament was formed in 1980, a majority of deputies are neither nationalist nor separatist. And also for the first time, the PNV is unlikely to provide the lehendakari, as the Basques call their premier.
""This is a moment of historic importance,"" maintains Eduardo Madina, a Basque Socialist deputy in Madrid. Mr Madina, who had a leg blown off by an ETA bomb attack seven years ago, hails a new era that ""will bring tranquillity both to the Basque country and to Spain"". The absence of ETA attacks during the campaign was one sign of the new calm. ETA reportedly recruited only ten new activists last year. ""Many people, especially the young, think of ETA as a relic from the past,"" says Carmen Gallastegui, president of the Basque Foundation for Science.
The Basque Socialist leader, Patxi Lopez, has pledged to bridge the divide between nationalists and non-nationalists. But he needs the support of the conservative People's Party (PP) to rule, and they are unnatural allies. The PP is the main opposition to the Socialist government under Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero in Madrid. And one issue the parties fight over most fiercely is the future of the Basque country and how to deal with ETA. 
Yet the PP despises Basque nationalism even more than Mr Zapatero, so it is offering to help Mr Lopez to take power. Many Basques would prefer a grand alliance between the Socialists and the PNV, but that looks unlikely to work. If the vote from abroad does not give Mr Lopez one more seat, he will need the backing of a second party besides the PP, either the hard left or a prickly Basque centrist group. ""It could be messy and unstable,"" concludes Kepa Aulestia, a commentator for the Vocento group of newspapers, of any minority government under Mr Lopez. 
Even if Mr Lopez manages to become lehendakari, the fog of Basque politics will not fully clear. Perhaps 10% of the voters went to the polls only to lodge a protest. Their parties, which were deemed to be fronts for ETA, had been banned. For the first time those parties are absent from the Basque parliament. Had their votes counted, they would have tipped the balance of power firmly back to the nationalists.
Nor will his party's sensational Basque success make Mr Zapatero's position in Madrid much easier. His minority government relies on the backing of a handful of PNV deputies, who will now probably pull out. So Mr Zapatero may have to look elsewhere, to the hard left or the Catalan nationalists, for backing.
Moreover the PP, previously in some trouble, won convincingly in Galicia. The nationalists they threw out of power were junior partners in a coalition led by local Socialists. Galicia is Mr Zapatero's biggest loss to the PP in the five years since he became prime minister, and is thus a significant boost to the PP's embattled leader, Mariano Rajoy, himself a Galician.
Meanwhile the economic news in Spain goes from bad to worse. Unemployment touched almost 3.5m in February, and could reach 20% of the workforce next year. So Mr Zapatero, who was elected to a second term last year, faces big political problems. In June elections to the European Parliament will test the mood across the country. Right now recession-hit Spaniards have deeper concerns than their regions' pretensions. The European elections will show whether a different tide is turning--against Mr Zapatero himself.

Iowa and Vermont became the latest American states to legalise gay marriage. Iowa's Supreme Court ruled that a state ban on same-sex marriage was unconstitutional and violated the rights of gay couples. In Vermont, lawmakers overrode the governor's veto of a bill, making it the first state where gay marriage is made legal by a legislative act and not by a court decision.

America and other countries believe the launch was in fact a test of a Taepodong-2 missile, capable of carrying nuclear warheads as far as Alaska, but that it failed, falling into the sea beyond Japan. Efforts to persuade the UN Security Council to issue a strong condemnation of the launch proved difficult; China and Russia backed North Korea's explanation, and said it was within its rights. Meanwhile, Barack Obama proclaimed that America had a ""moral responsibility"" to lead a campaign to rid the world of nuclear weapons.

South Africa's prosecuting authority dropped all charges, including those of fraud and racketeering, against Jacob Zuma, who heads the ruling African National Congress. The path is thus cleared for him to become the country's president after an election on April 22nd. The decision raises fears that the judiciary's independence may be weakening under political pressure.

SECOND-TERM prime ministers often feel the pull of the world stage. In Spain, too--though Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero, re-elected a year ago, was slow to follow the trend. That was partly because he was one of George Bush's least favourite European leaders. In a frenzied few days, however, Mr Zapatero has made up for it, with appearances in six countries from Chile to Turkey. He eventually carried off his prize, when Barack Obama declared that he was ""glad to call him a friend"".
Unfortunately, Mr Zapatero's frantic week abroad coincided with trouble at home. Immediately after he stepped off the plane in Madrid, he announced a cabinet reshuffle. Out went the heavyweight Pedro Solbes, the veteran finance minister who was praised during the election campaign as the man to trust on the economy. In his place appeared Elena Salgado, a seasoned if low-profile technocrat. Ms Salgado, slight but tenacious, has held tough ministerial posts at health and public administration. Few, however, expected her to be given the finance hot seat. 
In truth, Ms Salgado will not be able to pack Mr Solbes's punch. She may instead find herself battling the economic team at the prime minister's Moncloa palace. Mr Zapatero's insistence that he chose Ms Salgado for her fine administrative skills suggests that he may want to take more direct control of economic policy himself. 
Mr Solbes seems a surprising sacrifice. His sturdy, gloomy and world-weary countenance, and his soft-spoken manner, were ideally suited to these straitened times. He exuded the experience and gravitas needed to reassure financial markets. His departure gives Spain only its third finance minister in 16 years: Mr Solbes and Rodrigo Rato, of the opposition People's Party (PP), had alternated since 1993. He was, however, a tired man. Asked what he envied most about a colleague who resigned in February, Mr Solbes quipped that it was being an ex-minister. His fiscal conservatism also clashed with Mr Zapatero's fondness for public spending as a solution to the crisis.
Mr Zapatero is only now starting to pay the price for recession. His Socialist Party lost the regional election in Galicia to the PP last month. A poll in Publico, a newspaper, puts the party slightly behind the PP, which may win June's European elections. Unusually, Mr Zapatero also failed to keep his government shuffle a secret. As a result he had to share front-page Obama photographs with headlines about ministers awaiting the sack. Party discipline broke down in his absence and leaks started. It is a sign of growing nerves.
Spain's economic pain looks likely to last. The Bank of Spain thinks GDP will shrink by 3% this year and another 1% in 2010. A tentative recovery, it says, may not come until late in 2010, a year later than Mr Zapatero has predicted. Worst of all, unemployment will soar past 4m to a whopping 19.4%. The central bank's gloomy forecasts came after Spain's first bank rescue of the credit crunch. The small Caja Castilla La Mancha savings bank has been bailed out after it sank under the weight of loans to a once hyperactive and overblown property sector. Other rescues may follow. 
Ms Salgado will accordingly have her hands full. Her mission is to speed up the response to the crisis. She also needs to reform an outdated economic model that is overly dependent on a low-quality (and increasingly out of a job) workforce--something Mr Solbes tried to do, but without getting enough political support. ""Education, education, education,"" Mr Zapatero said, aping Britain's Tony Blair, as he announced his new priorities. In her old job Ms Salgado boxed with Spain's quarrelsome regional governments. She will have to learn when to hit, and when to dodge, if she is to survive as many rounds as her predecessor did.",230,Spain,"Spain's prime minister brings in a new finance minister

THE Basque separatists of ETA used to grab headlines with their terrorist attacks. Now they win them when yet another leader is nabbed. On April 18th it was the turn of Jurdan Martitegi, who police believe had been ETA's military chief for four months, to be arrested in France. At least he outlasted his predecessor, who held the job for just three weeks. The previous military head had the post for a full six months before being caught. 
This churn at the top is good news. Each arrest forces ETA to reorganise, leaving it less time to plan and to plant bombs. Mr Martitegi and seven others arrested with him seem to have been planning a car-bomb attack in early May. That would have given a bloody welcome to Patxi Lopez, a Socialist poised to take over as the Basque region's first non-nationalist premier since 1980. 
The serial arrests of ETA's military chiefs may be even better news in the long term. The four captured over the past year apparently belonged to a hardline faction that pushed for an end to ETA's ceasefire two years ago. Now there are signs that the peaceniks have regained control. Josu Urrutikoetxea, a veteran who took part in talks during the ceasefire, is said to be back near the top. Arnaldo Otegi, who has served time in jail for terrorist offences, has reappeared as a spokesman for ETA's political arm. He is said to want a negotiated end to four decades of violence. 
Yet the Madrid government of Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero may not be in a mood to negotiate. ETA made a fool of Mr Zaptero in late 2006, when it exploded a car bomb at Madrid's Barajas airport, killing two people, during its most recent ceasefire. The interior minister, Alfredo Perez Rubalcaba, noted that this was the third time that a Spanish government had been burnt after talking to ETA. There will not be a fourth, he declared after the latest arrests.

THE huge signs are up in town squares, city parks and myriad spots where men in overalls dig holes, lay pavements or spruce up public facilities. They proclaim that the work is being paid for by Plan E, the stimulus package pushed through by Spain's Socialist prime minister, Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero. This included EUR 8 billion ($11 billion) for immediate spending by town halls. 
Plan E was meant to keep Spaniards working. Yet the latest unemployment figures show that it is not enough. In April 40,000 more people joined the dole queues. That was a slower rise than in previous months, but it still leaves Spain with a 17.4% unemployment rate, the highest in the European Union and twice the EU average. The European Commission predicts that unemployment will hit 20.5% next year. It also says Spain will struggle longer than other countries to recover, getting into positive growth only in 2011, a full year after the EU as a whole. ""The sick man of Europe"" was how the pro-government El Pais newspaper greeted the news. 
Perhaps the most worrying thing is that Plan E has, in part, worked. The government says it has created some 280,000 jobs, even if few are permanent. The effect is temporary, said Pablo Vazquez of the Foundation for Applied Economic Studies. In August and September unemployment may climb again. Spain is lucky that strong social networks (helped by the black economy) help to prevent civil unrest. 
The economy is in a double bind. It has been engulfed, like the rest of the world, by recession and shrinking global trade. To this is added Spain's own particular crisis, as a model based on cheap labour and a dizzy property market hits the skids. Economists say that Spain must now make the sacrifices and take the tough decisions that it avoided during the long boom years. 
Labour-market reform is perhaps the toughest of all. In some ways Spain's labour laws are quite flexible. With almost a third of the workforce on temporary contracts, marginal workers are easy to shed by the simple expedient of not renewing contracts. That explains why Spain accounts for over half the additional unemployment within the euro area in the past year. The rest of the workforce is on Teflon-coated permanent contracts that make people difficult and expensive to sack. Companies inevitably choose staff to shed on the basis of how easy they are to fire. 
Almost everyone favours reform. Such an initiative is urgently needed, with the government leading it, said a group of 95 academic economists in a letter. Mr Zapatero, however, does not share their sense of urgency. And labour-market reforms are not all that he is shying away from. The Bank of Spain recently issued a warning about a dwindling pension pot, suggesting it was time to push the retirement age above 65. Liberalisation of services provided by everyone from notaries and lawyers to veterinarians would help the recovery, said Jose Carlos Diez of Intermoney, a consultancy. ""Whenever we have had a liberalisation plan, the economy has shown its potential for growth,"" he added. 
So why does Mr Zapatero not reform? Besides all the usual worries about strikes, trade unions and public support, his main problem lies in parliament. Last month his minority government lost its first parliamentary vote. Although the Socialists are only seven seats short of an absolute majority, they are struggling to find allies. Basque nationalist deputies are angry that a Socialist, Patxi Lopez, has just become their region's premier. Catalan nationalists are similarly tired of the Socialist-led administration in their region. A fractious group of left-wing parties is not always reliable and unlikely to back tough reforms. 
That leaves the main opposition, the conservative People's Party, which now leads in the opinion polls. Some Spaniards would like to see the two big parties push a reform agenda through together.

THE Spanish prime minister, Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero, has the legerdemain of a magician. In last month's state-of-the-nation debate, he plucked many rabbits from the hat: a laptop for every schoolchild, EUR 2,000 ($2,800) for new-car buyers, tax breaks for small businesses who held on to employees. Mr Zapatero did not explain how to pay for all this in a deep recession, but his was a bewitching performance. In a poll asking who won the debate, he beat the opposition People's Party (PP) leader, Mariano Rajoy. With unemployment fast heading towards 20%, this represents a Houdini-like escape from the frustration of many Spaniards. 
The problem is that Mr Zapatero is in no position to make big promises. He heads a minority Socialist government. It cannot pass laws without smaller parties. Nor does he control the purse strings of regional governments that must help to pay for his headline-grabbing schemes. Indeed, when parliament voted on them, they had been watered down into vague plans for the future. It was further proof that Mr Zapatero's political weakness is damaging his ability to pep up an economy that shrank by 3% in the past year. 
Some of Mr Zapatero's measures were gimmicky, but others were promising. A proposal to abolish tax breaks on mortgages for the better off is politically brave. It marries fiscal austerity with the removal of a subsidy that has long pushed up house prices. And putting the change off until 2011 might encourage buyers to mop up some of the million unsold homes on the market. Yet Mr Zapatero has to negotiate such plans with tiny parties, mostly on the left. ""The truth is that right now we do not know what will happen,"" concludes Fernando Encinar of www.idealista.com, a property website.
Mr Zapatero must have known he could not fulfil his pledges, which seem to have been devised for the European election on June 7th. The polls put the PP level or only just ahead. The PP expects a bigger win but the signs are that the economic crisis has not yet sunk Mr Zapatero. He is helped by the fact that the PP has its own problems--especially long-running scandals that have tarnished its reputation in strongholds like Madrid and Valencia.
The unknown quantity is a new centre party, Rosa Diez's Union for Progress and Democracy (UPyD). Ms Diez, a former Socialist, refuses to define herself along the left-right axis, claiming it has become meaningless. But she is firmly positioned on the other axis that runs through Spanish politics, the balance of power between central government and the regions. Ms Diez, a Basque, is militantly centralist. She believes regional governments have too much power and wants to claw back central control over, for example, education. ""A lot of Spaniards now feel that the state itself needs defending,"" she says. 
Her pitch works both on discontented leftists who see Spain's regions as a driver of inequality and on former PP voters worried that their party has shifted too far right. Mr Zapatero wooed the nationalist end of the spectrum before the 2008 election, rewriting Catalonia's statute and seeking talks with the violent Basque separatists, ETA. Many Spaniards disapprove of the Socialist-separatist coalition ruling Catalonia. Ms Diez's aim is for the UpyD to come third in the European election, displacing the communist-led United Left. For his part Mr Zapatero talks of a deal with unions and employers to transform Spain's bricks-and-mortar economy into a knowledge-based one. He will need more than a magician's hat to pull that off.",230,Spain,"The difficulty of running a minority government in a deep recession

""The truth is that right now we do not know what will happen,"" concludes Fernando Encinar of www.idealista.com, a property website.
Mr Zapatero must have known he could not fulfil his pledges, which seem to have been devised for the European election on June 7th. The polls put the PP level or only just ahead. The PP expects a bigger win but the signs are that the economic crisis has not yet sunk Mr Zapatero. He is helped by the fact that the PP has its own problems--especially long-running scandals that have tarnished its reputation in strongholds like Madrid and Valencia.
The unknown quantity is a new centre party, Rosa Diez's Union for Progress and Democracy (UPyD). Ms Diez, a former Socialist, refuses to define herself along the left-right axis, claiming it has become meaningless. But she is firmly positioned on the other axis that runs through Spanish politics, the balance of power between central government and the regions. Ms Diez, a Basque, is militantly centralist. She believes regional governments have too much power and wants to claw back central control over, for example, education. ""A lot of Spaniards now feel that the state itself needs defending,"" she says. 
Her pitch works both on discontented leftists who see Spain's regions as a driver of inequality and on former PP voters worried that their party has shifted too far right. Mr Zapatero wooed the nationalist end of the spectrum before the 2008 election, rewriting Catalonia's statute and seeking talks with the violent Basque separatists, ETA. Many Spaniards disapprove of the Socialist-separatist coalition ruling Catalonia. Ms Diez's aim is for the UpyD to come third in the European election, displacing the communist-led United Left. For his part Mr Zapatero talks of a deal with unions and employers to transform Spain's bricks-and-mortar economy into a knowledge-based one. He will need more than a magician's hat to pull that off.",True

IT TAKES more than an economic crisis to revolutionise Spanish politics. Bombs, like those that killed 191 people on Madrid trains in 2004, can topple governments. But unemployment at 18% does not. So the European elections, which gave the opposition People's Party (PP) a modest four-point victory, suggest. Yet the PP's win was significant. This is the first national vote it has won over Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero's Socialists in nine years. ""A majority have expressed their will for change,"" said the PP leader, Mariano Rajoy.
Has the tide turned? There are plenty of ills to worry about. One in five Spaniards will soon be out of work. Economists predict that Spain will be one of the last rich countries to emerge from the recession. Some 30% of children leave school without qualifications. Only 5% of exports are high-tech, and research spending is feeble. More than a million new homes sit unsold. Meanwhile a large part of the workforce is protected by armour-clad contracts. 
Yet the PP's modest win does not mean that all Spaniards want change. It will help Mr Rajoy to see off both critics and potential challengers. It will also boost the PP's confidence as it tries to trip Mr Zapatero up in parliament, where he is seven seats short of a majority. What it will not do is put Mr Zapatero's back against the wall. Indeed, with a general election still three years off, he may have time to see the recession through. Even the glummest economists do not see it lasting until 2012.
Spain takes over the six-month rotating European Union presidency in January, offering Mr Zapatero photo opportunities galore with world leaders. His party machine is already trying to sell him as ""Europe's Obama"". He has serious business to attend to at home--which an absence of elections should make easier. First is the parlous state of some savings banks. Spanish banks may have avoided subprime excesses, but home-made poisons are floating to the surface. The Caja Castilla La Mancha was only the first to fall; more may soon be in trouble and a EUR 9 billion ($13 billion) rescue fund is in the pipeline.
A longer-term task is to transform Spain's low-tech economy. Mr Zapatero promises a sustainable-economy law but has given few details. He has no desire to confront the unions, so radical labour-market reform is unlikely. Real change might require him to make enemies. He has shown no appetite for that.

LIFE is looking up for metalworkers in Cuenca, east of Madrid. They have won a pay rise of 3% in real terms. In a country with falling GDP and unemployment of 18%, that is no small feat. Yet it is not unusual. Spain's centralised wage-bargaining system awarded real pay rises of 3.5% in May, the highest in a dozen years. Spaniards in work might be forgiven for concluding that recession is beneficial.
The fate of Spanish workers is a story of contrasts. Some have never had it so good; others have never had it so bad. Spain has the European Union's highest unemployment and one of its less generous welfare systems. It has shed 1.2m jobs in a year. It will soon have as many jobless as Italy and France combined. Pay rises for some have led employers to cut the jobs of others. Two-thirds of workers have armour-clad permanent contracts. But the rest are on short-term deals. They are the people now on the dole.
This two-tier labour market divides workers into a privileged group cocooned from the reality of recession and the disadvantaged on temporary contracts, in unemployment or in illegal jobs. Employers do not invest in training short-term workers and are wary of hiring on permanent contracts. At any hint of a slowdown they shed the short-timers. ""That the crisis has hit Spanish employment disproportionately is due to the catastrophic way the labour market works,"" argues Luis Garicano of the London School of Economics. 
Professor Garicano is one of a group of 100 economists who have called on the Socialist prime minister, Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero, to set about labour-market reforms. The calls have fallen on deaf ears. Talks between unions and employers stalled when the bosses proposed to cut the cost of laying off privileged workers. The government retorted that this was a ""red line"" it would not cross. Mr Zapatero will not be taking on the unions.
Nor does he seem able to change Spain's low-skilled economy. Unions and employers have spent a year failing to reform it. Inertia rules, for several reasons. One is that Mr Zapatero does not believe reform is a priority. Another is that he does not want to provoke a general strike. A third is that his minority government struggles to win parliamentary votes. One day of talks with potential allies recently saw tax rises on high earners announced and withdrawn within six hours.
Opponents of reform argue that labour-market rigidity did not get Spain into its mess. Toni Ferrer, chief negotiator for the General Workers Union says real-terms pay rises averaged just 0.5% a year since 2005. Today's wage rises, he says, are based on official forecasts of 2% inflation, compared with slight deflation now. ""The problem is not labour regulation,"" says Mr Ferrer. ""What needs changing is the economic model."" That model produced the housing bubble that is largely responsible for Spain's woes.
Mr Zapatero seems bent on spending his way out of trouble. The budget deficit is heading for 12% of GDP. Fallout from the housing bust has forced him to set up a EUR 99 billion ($138 billion) bank-rescue fund. The banks, especially the savings banks, are sitting on a pile of bad loans. Many of the newly jobless are unskilled construction workers, mostly on temporary contracts. They are now adding to banks' woes by defaulting on mortgages. Recovery depends on getting them back into work.
Rising unemployment does not mean that Spain's economy is shrinking faster than others. This year's predicted drop in GDP of 3.2% is less than the European average--and far below Germany's 5.4% drop. But Germany has shed fewer jobs (see chart). With a large pool of unemployed, Spanish firms may be able to rehire at lower rates. A two-tier labour market provides flexibility, but on the back of an underclass of temporary workers. This might strike most socialists as unjust.

IT IS famous for Barbary apes, cheap shops and stunning views of Europe and Africa. Until this week, however, these attractions had failed to lure any Spanish government minister to the British territory of Gibraltar for over 300 years (Gibraltar was captured in 1704 and ceded to Britain under the Treaty of Utrecht in 1713). So when Spain's foreign minister, Miguel Angel Moratinos, drove across the border on July 21st, it was an historic moment. Yet there were few fireworks. He did not try to plant a Spanish flag atop the limestone outcrop that gives Gibraltar its nickname of ""the Rock"". Nor did he renounce a centuries-old battle to regain sovereignty.
Spanish conservatives accused him of treason. ""For the dignity of Spain, don't throw 300 years of determination overboard,"" read one protest banner. On their side of the border Gibraltarians hung Union flags from balconies to remind him of their loyalty. Yet sovereignty was the great unmentionable at his meeting with the British foreign secretary, David Miliband, and Gibraltar's chief minister, Peter Caruana. For once, Britain and Spain were not grabbing at each other's throats.
Mr Moratinos's visit was part of a new entente over the Rock. Where previous governments used sticks, Spain's Socialist prime minister, Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero, is keener on carrots. A three-year-old agreement allows Britain, Spain and Gibraltar to discuss mutual problems without backing away from their views on sovereignty. ""We have been beating ourselves against the rock of incomprehension for too many years,"" said Mr Moratinos. Spain still wants to recover Gibraltar, he insisted. It just thinks that dialogue and co-operation are better than threats.
The new approach reflects the reality of life in and around Gibraltar. Apart from some old-style British architecture, red pillar-boxes and pubs serving tepid British beer, Mr Moratinos probably felt at home. Most Gibraltarians speak fluent Spanish. Some prefer it to English. They even speak with a lisping accent similar to that of their neighbours in the Spanish town of La Linea de la Concepcion. 
Much has changed since the border, slammed shut by Franco in 1969, reopened in 1985. Gibraltar is no longer a big British naval base. A booming economy employs a lot of Spaniards: as many as 3,000 pour across the border every day. Even some of the 29,000 native Gibraltarians now live in Spain and commute to work on the crowded two-and-a-half square miles (6.5 square km) of the Rock. 
The entente, which has brought better communications with Spain, has helped to fuel the boom. Gibraltar has been registering Chinese-style growth. Even the housing market is holding up, unlike those in Spain and Britain. Offshore finance, internet gambling, shipping, tourism and a weak pound all help. And the benefits spill into one of Spain's poorest regions.
Later this year the government-run Cervantes Institute, which promotes Spanish culture around the world, will open a branch on the Rock. That will help fill Gibraltarians' minds with Spanish thought. Their hearts, however, remain obstinately British. Referendums have shown that almost all want to stay that way.",230,Spain,"An historic visit, but the same arguments over sovereignty

But Mr Zapatero's Socialist party has slipped only slightly behind the opposition People's Party, according to an opinion poll this week. Even if Mr Zapatero himself is less popular than he was, he still bests Mariano Rajoy, the plodding opposition leader. That is despite an unemployment rate that has shot up to 19%, double the average in the euro area. 
In clearing his desk, Mr Zapatero pulled off a couple of deals that will shore up his position. First, he clinched an agreement over changes to the financing of Spain's autonomous regional governments (
). This will give more money to Catalonia, and should earn him the backing of Catalan nationalist parties for the budget vote in parliament in the autumn. Without their support, the budget might bring down his government, since his party lacks a parliamentary majority. Second, he sided with the trade unions to block demands from business leaders to reform Spain's two-tier labour market. That has seen off the risk of a general strike.
For all their tactical political deftness, these agreements carry an economic cost for Spain. They are, alas, typical of Mr Zapatero's way of governing. By his refusal to countenance unpopular measures and his habit of showering public money on any problem, he risks prolonging the recession.
Spain's decade of growth has come to a painful end. In contrast to much of Europe, which is home to a few green shoots (
), Spain's economy still looks as arid as the meseta. True, other European economies may contract more than the 4% decline the IMF forecasts for Spain this year (for that Mr Zapatero and his government's big fiscal stimulus deserve some credit). The problem is that the recession looks set to drag on much longer in Spain than elsewhere; many forecasters see no recovery before the end of 2010. 
That is because Spain's problems stem not just from the global crisis, but from weaknesses at home. Its growth was based on low-skilled, labour-intensive industries such as house-building and tourism. Although 1m homes remain unsold, construction still accounted for 10% of GDP in the first quarter of this year--twice its share in Britain. Spain needs to use the time bought by deficit spending to reshape its economy. An expensive, poorly educated labour force
That means reforming not just the dysfunctional education system but also the disastrous labour market. Mr Zapatero refuses ""to cheapen the firing"" of the two-thirds of the workforce on permanent contracts, who must be paid 45 days for each year of service if they are laid off. His refusal blunts the incentive to hire. Collective-bargaining rules mean that wages for the country's labour aristocracy are rising even as prices are falling. Since Spain, a euro member, can no longer devalue, its businesses are becoming even less competitive. 
An initially strong fiscal position is rapidly eroding, with the budget deficit heading for 12% of GDP this year. If growth remains elusive, investors will soon demand a higher return on the government's bonds. But Mr Zapatero is spending regardless. Catalonia had something of a case for a bigger slice of the cake. But it looks as if the regional financing deal will add another percentage point of GDP to the deficit.
Mr Zapatero seems to be counting on inertia to pull his country out of its slump, allowing him to win a third term in 2012. He will be lucky to get away with it.

AFTER a year of mudslinging and recrimination, Spain's prime minister, Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero, has finally worked out how to stop regional governments squabbling over the shrinking pot of public finances. The solution is simple. They can all have more. 
An extra EUR 11 billion euros ($15.6 billion) will be distributed, marking another step in the march of power away from Madrid towards the country's 17 regions. With the budget deficit already ballooning, the deal will make sound economic management still harder. 
Even those regions run by the opposition People's Party (PP), which include Madrid and Valencia, did not vote against the offer. They abstained. They do not like the new system but, facing economic problems of their own, prefer to take the money. The deal is frustratingly vague about numbers, though some regions, such as Catalonia, will be bigger winners than others. It is the financing model that best reflects the reality of Spain, said Mr Zapatero. 
So if everyone is a winner, who loses? The central government will have less, says Jesus Fernandez-Villaverde, of the University of Pennsylvania. Economists think the deal will increase the budget deficit--already heading towards 12% of GDP--by one percentage point. The finance minister, Elena Salgado, admits the deal will increase the central budget deficit a bit, but argues it will mostly transfer existing debt from the regions to the central government. Future taxpayers are losers too, as they must pay off Spain's debt in the long term. 
For the moment, Mr Zapatero looks like the winner. At elections last year, his Socialist Party fell seven seats short of an absolute majority. Many of the extra parliamentary votes Mr Zapatero needs are in the hands of small regional, nationalist or separatist parties. There is no better way to keep them sweet than to increase funding for their home regions. 
The new deal certainly reflects one of Spain's new realities: the big spenders of public money are regional governments, who run education, health and myriad other services. It did not, however, fix one big problem. Regional governments may decide where a lot of the tax money goes, but have little influence over how it is raised (except in the Basque Country and Navarra, which remain outside this deal). So there is less pressure on them to be efficient. 
The spread of devolution has been a game of follow-the-leader: independent-minded regions such as the Basque Country and Catalonia show the way; the others demand equal treatment. The latest financing rules are, in many ways, a result of Catalonia's statute of autonomy, passed by the Socialists in 2006. Under Mr Zapatero, devolution continues apace. What no one can say is where, or when, it will end.

So if everyone is a winner, who loses? The central government will have less, says Jesus Fernandez-Villaverde, of the University of Pennsylvania. Economists think the deal will increase the budget deficit--already heading towards 12% of GDP--by one percentage point. The finance minister, Elena Salgado, admits the deal will increase the central budget deficit a bit, but argues it will mostly transfer existing debt from the regions to the central government. Future taxpayers are losers too, as they must pay off Spain's debt in the long term. 
For the moment, Mr Zapatero looks like the winner. At elections last year, his Socialist Party fell seven seats short of an absolute majority. Many of the extra parliamentary votes Mr Zapatero needs are in the hands of small regional, nationalist or separatist parties. There is no better way to keep them sweet than to increase funding for their home regions. 
The new deal certainly reflects one of Spain's new realities: the big spenders of public money are regional governments, who run education, health and myriad other services. It did not, however, fix one big problem. Regional governments may decide where a lot of the tax money goes, but have little influence over how it is raised (except in the Basque Country and Navarra, which remain outside this deal). So there is less pressure on them to be efficient. 
The spread of devolution has been a game of follow-the-leader: independent-minded regions such as the Basque Country and Catalonia show the way; the others demand equal treatment. The latest financing rules are, in many ways, a result of Catalonia's statute of autonomy, passed by the Socialists in 2006. Under Mr Zapatero, devolution continues apace. What no one can say is where, or when, it will end.

FIRST it was spend, spend, spend. Now it is tax, tax, tax. As Spain's budget deficit soars and economic recovery remains elusive, the Socialist prime minister, Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero, has made clear how he expects to start balancing the books. ""I am going to ask for a share of people's incomes out of solidarity and to meet the demands of the most needy,"" Mr Zapatero told parliament on September 9th. 
He said the 2010 budget would aim to raise overall taxes by 1.5% of GDP, which should earn the government about EUR 15 billion ($22 billion). Mr Zapatero did not spell out how he would do this, leaving the matter to negotiations with parties whose support he needs to get the budget passed. 
Still, Mr Zapatero is performing a U-turn. In previous years he cut the top rate of income tax, slashed company tax and brought in a populist EUR 400 ($560) annual rebate for all Spanish taxpayers. But that was when Spain was booming. The latest data shows that GDP is shrinking by 4.2% annually. Spain also has Europe's worst unemployment, at 18% and climbing.
Respite will not come soon. Spain's recession, made worse by a burst housing bubble, is different from those of other European countries. Some economies are already starting to look up, but Spain's will not recover for another year. The construction industry is in tatters and, with hundreds of thousands of unsold new houses, is not about to recover. 
An EUR 8 billion public-works stimulus combined with a dramatic fall in revenues has blown an enormous hole in the public accounts (see chart). This year's budget deficit is expected to be around 10% of GDP. Yet Mr Zapatero has promised extra money to everyone, from regional governments to the long-term unemployed. Next year will see an extra EUR 5 billion given to town halls. 
Unless he is prepared to cut spending, Mr Zapatero can only keep his promise to cut the deficit to 3% of gdp by raising taxes. ""I have always thought of fiscal policy as an instrument that should respond to changes in the state of the economy,"" he said recently. Mr Zapatero will probably scrap his income-tax rebate, or most of it. But he is cautious about raising income tax. The public-works minister Jose Blanco, a Socialist heavyweight, floated the idea of higher taxes for big earners during the summer, but the prime minister firmly squashed it.
The main target, apart from obvious things like alcohol, tobacco and petrol, is likely to be capital-gains tax. This was set at 18% in 2007, far below a top tax rate on earned income of 43%. Investors are anxiously waiting to hear how much they will have to pay. The opposition People's Party (PP) which wants tax and spending cuts, mocks such moves. ""No tax rise is capable of covering up the hole you have made,"" the PP leader, Mariano Rajoy, told the prime minister in parliament.

FEW tiffs are as nasty as those between old friends. A bitter bust-up between Spain's prime minister, Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero, and the media giant Prisa, publisher of the newspaper El Pais, mirrors the intimacy that once reigned. It also highlights problems on both sides. 
Mr Zapatero's difficulties centre on the economy. Spain's unemployment rate is now 18% and rising. It may be the last big European economy to pull out of recession. A decision to raise taxes has roused few cheers. Critics accuse Mr Zapatero of dictating short-term solutions on the hoof, rather than tackling deeper ills. 
Among the critics is now El Pais, Spain's biggest-selling daily, usually a Socialist ally. In recent editorials it has slammed Mr Zapatero's economic measures as ""incoherent"" and suggested that next year's budget is ""a backward step"". After the government revealed plans to raise an extra EUR 12 billion ($17 billion), including a hike in sales tax, it commented that ""this does not seem the best way to stimulate the economy"" and demanded an explanation of how it might help. 
But the newspaper's greatest ire has been reserved for a law rushed out to regulate terrestrial digital pay-television (TDT). The ""scandalous and abusive"" TDT law was, it thundered, aimed at ""satisfying the interests of a group of friends"". Those friends are Prisa's foes at Mediapro, a fast-expanding media group that launched a pro-Zapatero newspaper, Publico, two years ago. The two groups are battling not just for left-leaning newspaper readers but also for valuable TV football rights. The new law allowed Mediapro to promote its pay soccer channel to TDT viewers just as the league season started, hurting Prisa's own satellite-TV channel, Digital+.
It also came as the family-controlled Prisa group struggles with a EUR 5 billion debt caused by a badly timed partial buy-out of its Sogecable TV unit. Prisa has just sold stakes in two smaller businesses. It may also sell Digital+. Among those said to be interested is Mediaset, the media group of Italy's prime minister, Silvio Berlusconi. In a twist, he is in a row with El Pais over photographs it published of his parties in Sardinia.
Is there cause and effect in all this? The editor of El Pais, Javier Moreno, says not, pointing to critical editorials before the TDT row. Some readers do not believe him. Mr Zapatero accuses Prisa's media outlets of sharpening their knives. He also denies favouring Mediapro. Yet few doubt that the row will damage the Socialists. El Pais is the intellectual meeting-place of Spain's centre-left. And Prisa's media outlets, including the popular Cadena SER radio network, can do much to bring out the Socialist vote.
It is hard to separate chicken from egg. Relations have been edgy for a while. Any attack on government favouritism coming from Prisa, which did handsomely under Felipe Gonzalez, a former Socialist prime minister, sounds rich. Yet there should be few complaints if Spain's biggest newspaper now feels free to criticise its prime minister.

A PARISH council would not choose a chairman before his role and powers had been agreed. A corner shop would not select two bosses without deciding which carried more clout. Not so the European Union, which is preparing to choose two new bosses without any final agreement on the sort of person who should run the club.
At a summit at the end of this month (or, just possibly, in December if the Czech president still has not signed the Lisbon treaty) 27 national leaders will gather in Brussels and--after hours of coffee-fuelled, fluorescent-lit horse-trading--emerge with the name of the first permanent president of the European Council, a new post whose holder will chair summits and represent EU governments around the world.

The high rep's job is described in detail and enjoys things that convey power in the EU: a big budget, lots of staff and a guaranteed seat in important meetings. Yet if the president is a big-hitter whose name opens doors in Beijing and Washington, he will surely overshadow his rival.
That would not please everyone. Small countries dislike the European Council, an inter-governmental body in which the biggest countries rule and smaller fry struggle to be heard.

Among politicians from Mr Blair's (nominal) political family, the European Socialists, views of him range from ""mild dislike to hatred"", notes one senior official. In the eyes of the left, Mr Blair won three elections only by abandoning socialism.

It is not clear that national leaders would welcome his Hollywood star power: at future summits, for instance, journalists might all go to Mr Blair's press conference. His own country is divided by the idea of a President Blair. The opposition Conservatives are already cross that the Lisbon treaty will enter into force without the British public being able to vote on it in a referendum. Now, they fume, Britons must stomach the prospect of Mr Blair ""suddenly pupating into an intergalactic spokesman for Europe"", in the phrase of London's Tory mayor, Boris Johnson.

HE OILED his hair, told employees to call him Don Vito (the Mafia boss played by Marlon Brando in ""The Godfather"" films) and, according to Spanish investigators, allegedly kept politicians on his payroll. Documents released by a Spanish court indicate that for Francisco Correa, a Spanish businessman, bribery, fraud, money-laundering were all part of his way of doing business. 
Those same documents have also lifted the lid on Mr Correa's extensive network of friends and clients inside Spain's opposition People's Party (PP). To the immense embarrassment of a party that aspires to govern, they include everyone from a former party treasurer to a son-in-law of the former prime minister, Jose Maria Aznar. 
Mr Correa (pictured above) has been remanded in prison, pending investigation. A flurry of forced resignations and expulsions is unlikely to mark the end of the affair. A police report released by the court claims some EUR 5.5m ($8.2m) went into the pockets of 17 PP politicians. 
Regional governments and town halls run by the PP did large amounts of business with Mr Correa, whose interests ran from property to organising conferences. Mr Aznar's son-in-law, Alejandro Agag, who invited Mr Correa to his wedding, is not under investigation. But the list of those who are under suspicion has shaken the party to the core. 
The affair has reopened an internal war between Esperanza Aguirre, head of Madrid's PP-run regional government, and the party leader, Mariano Rajoy. The latest battlefield is Spain's second-largest savings bank, Caja Madrid. This is controlled by elected PP officials. Mr Rajoy wants the former IMF chief, Rodrigo Rato, to be the new chairman. Ms Aguirre wants to appoint her own political ally. Public insults are already flying between supporters of the two leaders. 
Even before this spat, Mr Rajoy had trouble enough controlling his party. And he does not inspire Spaniards, who see him as indecisive and slow to purge corrupt party members. All this threatens to destroy his lead over the Socialists headed by the prime minister, Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero. With the recession pushing unemployment to 18%, and Mr Zapatero intent on raising taxes, the PP had a five percentage-point lead in opinion polls; now Mr Zapatero, whose minority government has secured parliamentary support to pass next year's budget, is closing the gap.

To the immense embarrassment of a party that aspires to govern, they include everyone from a former party treasurer to a son-in-law of the former prime minister, Jose Maria Aznar. 
Mr Correa (pictured above) has been remanded in prison, pending investigation. A flurry of forced resignations and expulsions is unlikely to mark the end of the affair. A police report released by the court claims some EUR 5.5m ($8.2m) went into the pockets of 17 PP politicians. 
Regional governments and town halls run by the PP did large amounts of business with Mr Correa, whose interests ran from property to organising conferences. Mr Aznar's son-in-law, Alejandro Agag, who invited Mr Correa to his wedding, is not under investigation. But the list of those who are under suspicion has shaken the party to the core. 
The affair has reopened an internal war between Esperanza Aguirre, head of Madrid's PP-run regional government, and the party leader, Mariano Rajoy. The latest battlefield is Spain's second-largest savings bank, Caja Madrid. This is controlled by elected PP officials. Mr Rajoy wants the former IMF chief, Rodrigo Rato, to be the new chairman. Ms Aguirre wants to appoint her own political ally. Public insults are already flying between supporters of the two leaders. 
Even before this spat, Mr Rajoy had trouble enough controlling his party. And he does not inspire Spaniards, who see him as indecisive and slow to purge corrupt party members. All this threatens to destroy his lead over the Socialists headed by the prime minister, Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero. With the recession pushing unemployment to 18%, and Mr Zapatero intent on raising taxes, the PP had a five percentage-point lead in opinion polls; now Mr Zapatero, whose minority government has secured parliamentary support to pass next year's budget, is closing the gap.
From jail, Don Vito proclaims his innocence. Nevertheless, the PP hopes no one else from its ranks has been kissing his hand.",True

SPAIN is the new sick man of Europe. That was how some commentators greeted the news that, although most other European Union countries climbed out of recession in the third quarter, Spain's economy shrank, for the sixth quarter in a row. Yet a 0.3% drop in GDP was barely as big as Britain's. And Spain has suffered a smaller one-year fall than the EU average, with Germany, Italy and Britain all doing worse.
In none of these countries, however, has the pain of recession bitten so deep. Spain's 19% unemployment rate is second only to Latvia's in the EU. It reflects a structural hangover in a country that got drunk on bricks and mortar before its property bubble burst in 2007. Because of this, Spain entered recession in an already weakened state. As others recover slowly but predictably, Spain will need more time and extra care. Even optimists expect real recovery to come only in 2011.
Spain's Socialist prime minister, Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero, admits now that the housing boom, which peaked in his first term, was a bad thing. Some 900,000 of the new unemployed are largely unskilled construction workers, whose jobs may have gone for ever. Yet he is averse to pessimism. Recovery has started, he insisted at a round-table organised by The Economist on November 23rd. He also claimed that Spain's potential growth remained above the euro-area average. 
Mr Zapatero's credibility was dented when he refused to admit the scale of Spain's problems as it fell into recession. Even so, he believes he can steer the country back to growth. This week his government planned to unveil a ""sustainable economy"" law, the main part of a strategy that looks forward to 2020. But the law will be long on good intentions and short on tough measures. Renewable energy, modest liberalisation and more training are likely to be on the list. Bold labour-market reforms to make it easier to fire workers will not be, to avoid upsetting Mr Zapatero's trade-union friends. He prefers to rely on talks between the ""social partners"" that are unlikely to produce big change.
Spain's two-tier labour system is inefficient as well as unfair. Half the workers are on permanent contracts that make them extremely hard (and costly) to fire. Most of the rest scrape by in a netherworld of short-term contracts, bouts of unemployment and the black market. Workers on short-term contracts were the first to lose their jobs when recession hit. As Elena Salgado, the finance minister, claims, this gives the system a certain flexibility. But it is bad for productivity. Inefficient workers on permanent contracts are protected. There is no incentive to train the young and the temporary. 
A further rise in unemployment may come from smaller companies squeezed between tough labour laws and a credit drought. Given protection for permanent employees and limited wage flexibility, many small and medium-sized enterprises risk bankruptcy. And unemployment is itself a cause of future woes. It costs the state money in lost tax revenues and extra benefit payments. It triggers mortgage defaults and depresses consumer spending.
Ms Salgado is putting the brakes on fiscal expansion next year through tax rises and a slowdown in public spending--though infrastructure, including what will soon be Europe's most extensive high-speed rail network, will continue to receive money. The state rail company, Renfe, has already snatched half the Madrid-to-Barcelona traffic. Indeed, with its efficient, green technology, Renfe is a symbol of the new sustainable economy that Mr Zapatero wants to create. Yet this will still be a long-term project, and it may require bigger improvements than any now planned in education, as well as more spending on research and development.
Unfortunately, the shocking deterioration in the public finances, which have swung from a budget surplus in 2007 to a deficit of over 10% of GDP, is forcing retrenchment. Planned rises in taxes on income and sales are leading some economists to lower their forecasts for next year. The rises are taking purchasing power away from consumers, explains Javier Perez de Azpillaga of Goldman Sachs, who sees a return to modest growth in the fourth quarter followed by dips back into negative figures during a bumpy 2010.
With lower public spending and few radical reforms in prospect, where might new growth come from? A short-term saviour is the rest of the EU, which takes two-thirds of Spanish exports. The economy may ride on the coat-tails of recovery in France and Germany for a while. But Spain must one day do a lot more to put its own house in order.

EUROPE, it is said, must resist the temptation to become a giant Switzerland: ie, a smug, rich, insular place. But judging by the antics of European leaders as they filled two top European Union jobs on November 19th, the club faces another danger altogether: becoming a giant Belgium.
Lots of European countries indulge in shadowy coalition politics, with jobs divvied out among rival parties, but Belgium takes the biscuit. All Belgian governments are big coalitions, uniting parties that loathe one another, staffed by fixed quotas of ministers from the French- and Dutch-speaking communities (who also cannot stand each other). Democracy barely counts, as even parties thumped at the ballot box return to office. What is the link between this and the selection of Herman Van Rompuy as the first full-time president of the European Council, and of Catherine Ashton as a new foreign-policy chief? It is the European weakness for coalition politics, in which a quest for ""balance"" all too often trumps talent or merit.
There were winners and losers from the process that led to Mr Van Rompuy and Lady Ashton. The losers include those hoping for EU representatives to ""stop the traffic"" in Washington and Beijing. Mr Van Rompuy, an ascetic sort, has been prime minister of Belgium for less than a year: his name was pushed by France and Germany as a modest conservative from a small country who would chair EU summits without overshadowing them. Lady Ashton is capable and gets on with colleagues. But she has never held elected office and has no diplomatic experience. After a career in quasi-public agencies, she became a Labour minister, going to Brussels only in 2008 to take over the trade portfolio from Peter Mandelson. After the summit, Nicolas Sarkozy of France was asked why Lady Ashton was chosen. He gave three reasons: because it was felt a woman should hold a big EU job, because a centre-left politician was needed to ""balance"" Mr Van Rompuy and because ""our British friends"" wanted the post.
Arguably, the biggest winners were the pan-European parties that unite politicians from Europe's centre-right and centre-left. These umbrella parties, matched by parallel groups in the European Parliament, are barely known to the voters. They strain credibility as ideological alliances. The centre-left Party of European Socialists (PES) unites ex-communists from eastern Europe with Nordic social democrats. Yet most Nordic socialists are more comfortable with the free market than some nominally centre-right parties from France or Greece, which sit in the centre-right European People's Party (EPP).
Britain, as ever, is an outlier. Labour is well to the right of the PES mainstream. The Conservatives were so appalled by EPP federalism that they recently left the group. That pleased Tory Eurosceptics but waved goodbye to much influence. It is little wonder that Britain has failed to take pan-European parties seriously. Yet in early October, the EPP and PES agreed to divide the two top jobs between them, with the centre-right getting the president's post. That ruled out Tony Blair, a Labour man, but Britain ignored this. The British ""underestimated the capacity of the EPP and the PES to make their deal stick,"" says one diplomat. Instead, Gordon Brown pushed Mr Blair for council president all the way to November 19th (even if, for two weeks beforehand, that support was largely tactical). Hours before the summit met, he finally dropped Mr Blair in exchange for winning the foreign-policy post.
The deal was done at a small meeting of PES leaders. The guest list reads more like a ""Trivial Pursuit"" question than a roll call of world leaders. It included Borut Pahor (prime minister of Slovenia, if you must ask), Poul Nyrup Rasmussen (PES president) and Martin Schulz (the group's boss in the European Parliament), alongside better-known figures such as Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero of Spain. Mr Brown floated three names--Lord Mandelson, Geoff Hoon, a former defence secretary, and Lady Ashton. His colleagues deemed Lord Mandelson too abrasive (and he may not have been available anyway); Mr Hoon was tainted by Iraq; and they wanted a woman. So Lady Ashton it was. Browned off
There were complications along the way. In recent weeks, sources reveal, Mr Zapatero tried to persuade Mr Brown himself to try for council president: a suggestion that overlooks Mr Brown's air of frowning misery at most EU meetings. Many EU governments wanted Britain's foreign secretary, David Miliband, to have the foreign-policy job; he is clever and they wanted to harness Britain to the EU's ambitions for a security and defence policy. But he preferred to stay in domestic politics. The European Commission's president, Jose Manuel Barroso, promoted Lady Ashton because, as a serving commissioner, she ought to be more loyal than a newcomer. (The foreign-policy boss will answer to both the commission and national governments.) 
The new Lisbon treaty has boosted pan-European parties most of all. A dull-sounding change means that an absolute majority of the European Parliament must now approve the European Commission's president and his college of commissioners. That means all big parties must agree, giving each a potential veto. Some national leaders did not realise they ""couldn't escape"" the conditions of the pan-European parties, chuckles Mr Schulz. ""They understand it better now."" Talk of Britain getting the single-market portfolio was also bluff, as the parliament would have vetoed a Briton in charge of financial services.

It looks set to come into law during the 2010 season. 
The ban is about much more than friendliness to bulls, though it is part of a political game that resembles a bullfight. Whenever Catalans wave the red cape of a distinct identity, a chunk of middle Spain lowers its horns and charges. The Madrid-based media splenetically denounce Catalan nationalism. Just as left-wingers in Britain saw a ban on fox-hunting as a way of spiting toffs, so some Catalans see a ban on la corrida as a way of taunting (other) Spaniards, an especially popular pastime in an election year. Never mind that Catalonia's own traditions involve similar torments for the hapless animals. 
Catalonian fervour can be deceptive. Last month 167 separatist-minded towns and villages held informal referendums. The ""free Catalonia"" camp took a triumphant 95% of the vote. Yet only 27% of potential voters turned out. If so many Catalans in supposed nationalist hotbeds are so apathetic, a real poll, including cosmopolitan Barcelona and the rest of Catalonia, would surely produce a large no.
The limits of Catalan autonomy still cause heated debate. In one of its trickiest cases, Spain's constitutional court will decide shortly whether to strike out parts of an autonomy charter, passed in 2006 by Spain's parliament and approved in a referendum by Catalonia's 5.5m voters. The court has spent an unhurried three-and-a-half years pondering this, since Spain's opposition People's Party first challenged the charter. An even split between conservative and progressive judges seems to have produced deadlock. Now a decision is said to be imminent. Some believe this may be a defining moment for Spain. 
More wordy than radical, the charter talks of Catalonia as a nation and defines a series of matters to be dealt with bilaterally with the Spanish state. It gives extra autonomy to the Catalan justice system. Mostly, though, it gives just small nudges down the long path of devolution.
Yet that path must end somewhere. In effect, the court is being asked to do something that Spain's 1978 constitution ducked: to set limits to powers that can be handed to the 17 regional governments of an already decentralised country. The fathers of the constitution fudged their definition of Spain's three most independent-minded regions--the Basque Country, Catalonia and Galicia--by calling them nationalities (ie, neither full-blooded nations nor mere regions). Spaniards have argued over what this means ever since.
The court may strike out parts of the charter or, less controversially, set limits on how it is interpreted. Either way, it will heat up the atmosphere as Catalans prepare to vote for their own parliament in the autumn. This election will have a profound impact on Spain, as Convergence and Union (CiU), the moderate nationalist party that ran Catalonia for 23 years after 1980, may well return to power, ending a seven-year coalition between Socialists, the far left and extreme separatists.
CiU is unlikely to win an absolute majority. So it is likely to be in a similar position to Spain's prime minister, Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero, whose Socialist government in Madrid struggled to pass a budget for 2010. CiU, a party that likes to wield power in Madrid, has enough seats there to offer Mr Zapatero a more stable government. A quid pro quo in Catalonia could easily seal this deal.
That would marginalise both the far left and the extreme separatists, in Catalonia and Spain, perhaps boosting the chances of more liberalising reforms as the government deals with a near-20% unemployment rate. Many outside Catalonia are hoping for a CiU victory.

IN FEBRUARY 2005 Charlemagne spent a morning pestering voters in Barcelona for their views ahead of Spain's referendum on the European Union's planned Constitutional Treaty. It proved a tricky few hours. Voter after voter appeared baffled that their Yes might even be in doubt. ""Pues hombre, como no?"" replied one pensioner--or, roughly, ""Of course I will vote Yes."" After further prodding, the pensioner offered an explanation. ""We have to support Europe, because it means progress.""
Later that year, the constitution was killed off by No votes in France and the Netherlands, following heated referendum debates. (Reborn as the Lisbon treaty, a near-identical collection of rule changes, it came into force in December 2009.) But Spain's referendum was never in doubt. The prime minister, Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero, toured the country talking about the tens of billions of euros in subsidies poured into Spain since joining the EU in 1986. Four out of every ten kilometres of Spain's highway network were built with European money, Mr Zapatero told rallies: now, it was time to vote Yes ""in gratitude"".
It was not just the money. Arguments for or against European integration are often expressed in terms of objective economics, or rational interests. But one of Europe's little secrets is that Euroscepticism and Europhilia are not really determined by the head, but by the heart (and life-story). Who you are, and where you are from, matters more than any theory. For Britons, joining Europe in 1973 was overwhelmingly an act of economic pragmatism. For Spaniards old enough to remember Franco, joining the European Union felt like the capstone on a long process of liberation. Spaniards talk about ""Europe"" as bound up emotionally with the coming of democracy, with the release from isolation in a conservative, rural Iberian peninsula, even--in Barcelona--with the scrapping of Franco-era rules repressing the Catalan language. The phrase ""European constitution"" had positive overtones, thanks to Spanish reverence for their first post-Fascist constitution, drawn up in 1978 and still celebrated in an annual holiday.
All of this Euro-enthusiasm helps explain why Mr Zapatero's government is making such a meal of the fact that Spain took over the six-month rotating presidency of the EU on January 1st. Five days in, a series of former Euro-bigwigs, among them the ex-president of the European Commission, Jacques Delors, arrived in Madrid to discuss Spain's biggest ambition for its turn chairing ministerial meetings: the launch of a ""2020 strategy"" for Europe. This is a ten-year plan for boosting competitiveness and growth to help pay for Europe's generous welfare systems. It follows another ten-year plan, the old ""Lisbon strategy"", which failed wretchedly in its aim of making the EU ""the world's most competitive and dynamic knowledge-based economy"" by 2010.
Alas, the reaction has been unenthusiastic. Spanish unemployment is heading close to 20% (double the average among euro-zone countries), following the popping of a housing bubble of monstrous proportions. It is worsened by a two-tier labour market in which a hard core of permanent workers is almost impossible to sack, shovelling the pain onto those on temporary contracts, all too often meaning the young and immigrants. Editorials across the EU have mocked the idea of Mr Zapatero advising Europe on economic recovery.
Outsiders' hostility has other causes, too. Among these is belated shock that rotating six-month presidencies still exist. The Lisbon treaty creates a new standing president to chair meetings of national governments in the European Council, and a foreign-policy chief to chair meetings of foreign ministers. Brussels fizzes with rumours that the new council president, Herman Van Rompuy, who started work on January 4th, will be locked in a fight for airtime with Mr Zapatero. There is much sniffiness about Spain's insistence on hosting an EU-US summit in Madrid this May, so that Mr Zapatero can welcome Barack Obama to Spanish soil, though--some say--Mr Van Rompuy should by rights host the summit in Brussels. Some of this is just snippiness from bored Eurocrats. But some of the hostility matters. The refrain in Spain
In important ways, Spain symbolises, on a national scale, broader European trends. Its booming economy was hailed, for years, by those who (rightly) supported a model of EU enlargement based on competition, the removal of trade barriers, and catch-up growth. When Spain joined the block, it was a poor, rural, rather protectionist place. Long before the Polish plumber became a bogeyman, neighbours like France fretted about competition from cheap Spanish tomatoes and bricklayers. The deal, in effect, was for Spain to lift trade barriers and accept competition within the newly created single market in exchange for cash to modernise. For more than two decades, the results looked like a win for both sides. Spain modernised beyond recognition, and two-way trade with the rest of Europe boomed. Like it or not, Spain's economic agonies are a blow to that convergence model.
Next, Spain's rigid, overpriced labour market will be a test case for the euro zone, and whether countries that use the euro have the political will to regain competitiveness by lowering labour costs, now they cannot devalue their own currencies.
Finally, Spain offers warnings about being a midsized power, in an age increasingly dominated by emerging giants. Spain fought like fury to be invited to recent G20 summits. Mr Zapatero succeeded only in amplifying the sense that there were too many Europeans sitting at the table. The European Union, a bunch of midsized powers with lots of ideas about how the world should run its affairs--notably over climate change and financial regulation--should ponder Spain's lesson. If you want your advice to be heeded, you need something credible to say.",230,Spain,"Spain now leads the European Union, but not by example
IN FEBRUARY 2005 Charlemagne spent a morning pestering voters in Barcelona for their views ahead of Spain's referendum on the European Union's planned Constitutional Treaty. It proved a tricky few hours. Voter after voter appeared baffled that their Yes might even be in doubt. ""Pues hombre, como no?"" replied one pensioner--or, roughly, ""Of course I will vote Yes."" After further prodding, the pensioner offered an explanation. ""We have to support Europe, because it means progress.""
Later that year, the constitution was killed off by No votes in France and the Netherlands, following heated referendum debates. (Reborn as the Lisbon treaty, a near-identical collection of rule changes, it came into force in December 2009.) But Spain's referendum was never in doubt. The prime minister, Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero, toured the country talking about the tens of billions of euros in subsidies poured into Spain since joining the EU in 1986. Four out of every ten kilometres of Spain's highway network were built with European money, Mr Zapatero told rallies: now, it was time to vote Yes ""in gratitude"".
It was not just the money. Arguments for or against European integration are often expressed in terms of objective economics, or rational interests. But one of Europe's little secrets is that Euroscepticism and Europhilia are not really determined by the head, but by the heart (and life-story). Who you are, and where you are from, matters more than any theory. For Britons, joining Europe in 1973 was overwhelmingly an act of economic pragmatism. For Spaniards old enough to remember Franco, joining the European Union felt like the capstone on a long process of liberation. Spaniards talk about ""Europe"" as bound up emotionally with the coming of democracy, with the release from isolation in a conservative, rural Iberian peninsula, even--in Barcelona--with the scrapping of Franco-era rules repressing the Catalan language. The phrase ""European constitution"" had positive overtones, thanks to Spanish reverence for their first post-Fascist constitution, drawn up in 1978 and still celebrated in an annual holiday.
All of this Euro-enthusiasm helps explain why Mr Zapatero's government is making such a meal of the fact that Spain took over the six-month rotating presidency of the EU on January 1st. Five days in, a series of former Euro-bigwigs, among them the ex-president of the European Commission, Jacques Delors, arrived in Madrid to discuss Spain's biggest ambition for its turn chairing ministerial meetings: the launch of a ""2020 strategy"" for Europe. This is a ten-year plan for boosting competitiveness and growth to help pay for Europe's generous welfare systems. It follows another ten-year plan, the old ""Lisbon strategy"", which failed wretchedly in its aim of making the EU ""the world's most competitive and dynamic knowledge-based economy"" by 2010.
Alas, the reaction has been unenthusiastic. Spanish unemployment is heading close to 20% (double the average among euro-zone countries), following the popping of a housing bubble of monstrous proportions. It is worsened by a two-tier labour market in which a hard core of permanent workers is almost impossible to sack, shovelling the pain onto those on temporary contracts, all too often meaning the young and immigrants. Editorials across the EU have mocked the idea of Mr Zapatero advising Europe on economic recovery.

SOCIAL cohesion is one of those values all decent Europeans can sign up to: less social conflict and less of the inequality that America and Britain (see
) put up with. Some countries, notably Germany, really do manage to marry social harmony and economic reform. In the past decade Germany has--thanks to good management and obliging unions--kept its public sector in check, partly freed its labour market, held down unemployment, and regained competitiveness. Elsewhere, though, the need to preserve social cohesion, parroted by European politicians from left and right, has become a self-defeating excuse to avoid reform.
In Greece, for instance, the hard-pressed Socialist government of George Papandreou talks up social cohesion as a reason to avoid unduly large public-sector pay cuts in its urgent fiscal retrenchment. Spain's Socialist prime minister, Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero, touts it to justify the retention of labour-market laws that make it ruinously expensive to sack permanent employees. Italy's right-wing government, under Silvio Berlusconi, is similarly loth to lift burdensome regulations on small businesses and services for fear of protests and strikes. Sweden's centre-right leader, Fredrik Reinfeldt, is reluctant to be seen attacking his country's generous social model by trimming benefits, pay and pensions. Even France's conservative president, Nicolas Sarkozy, is unwilling to damage social cohesion (and risk trouble in the streets) by pushing hard for labour-market, pension and welfare reforms.
Two worrying common threads can be discerned in all this. One is that the natural desire for social cohesion is being abused to justify the protection of ""insiders""--those in permanent jobs, in trade unions or in privileged professions. But the cost of protecting insiders falls largely on ""outsiders""--the unemployed and those in temporary work, especially young people and immigrants. The gulf between insiders and outsiders destroys the very social cohesion that the policy is meant to preserve. And in the long run it is bad for everyone, because employers do not train temporary workers--a particular problem in economies like Italy and Spain, where new permanent contracts are rare. This lack of training is one of the main reasons why Europe's productivity growth over the past two decades has persistently lagged behind America's.
The second common thread is that social cohesion has become a reason to defend the privileges and perks of the public sector, which is also now the last bastion of trade unions. Across Europe many private-sector workers have seen their pay, pensions and other benefits frozen or cut by cash-strapped employers during the recession. Yet most governments, even Britain's, have been reluctant to apply similar treatment to the public sector. One result is that the state is taking a rising share of GDP, which is sure to lead to heavier taxes. Another is that public-sector pay and benefits have shot ahead as a cosseted caste extends its privileges. Follow the Irish--or Germans
Most governments seem too paralysed by their muddle-headed talk of social cohesion to act, despite the struggle to finance huge deficits. Yet they now have a striking example in Ireland. Faced with a gaping budget deficit and a recession, the Irish government has torn up its 30-year social compact with employers and unions. It has slashed public spending and made sharp cuts in pay. Indeed, pay is now falling across the whole economy. Not surprisingly, workers and unions are unhappy. This week, the public sector began a work-to-rule. But the harsh medicine seems to be working, as Ireland pulls out of recession, the public finances improve and the economy regains competitiveness lost inside the euro.
It is not always necessary to face down strikes. Italy and Spain could learn from Germany's trick of reforming without strife. But that may be beyond deeply troubled countries like Greece (
), which probably has no alternative but to copy Ireland. What all European governments must grasp, though, is that many of the policies espoused in the name of social cohesion do not promote compassion over cruelty. Rather, they encourage decline, entrench divisions and thus threaten the harmony they pretend to nurture.",230,Spain,"Social cohesion has become an excuse for avoiding necessary reforms in Europe

IT WAS a familiar cry against immigration. There is just not room for everyone, proclaimed Alicia Sanchez-Camacho, leader of the People's Party (PP) in Catalonia, where an election is due later this year. Her complaint has come a bit late. Spain's decade-long surge of immigrants has already come to a dramatic halt. The number of foreigners of working age began to fall in the second half of 2009. Recession has proved far more effective than policy at stemming the flow. A country in which unemployment has just gone over 4m and is heading towards a 20% rate is a poor bet for migrants. Indeed, the job outlook makes further falls in immigrant numbers likely.
So why is the PP raising what, in Spanish terms, is the novel bogeyman of immigration? In fairness, some others got there first. A coalition of Catalan nationalists, separatists and Socialists running the town hall at Vic, in Catalonia, put foreigners at the centre of debate with a controversial plan to keep some immigrants off municipal registers of residents. The Vic plan was similar to one already in place in Torrejon de Ardoz, a PP-run Madrid suburb.
This has provoked uproar in a country that prides itself on being immigrant-friendly. Municipal registers guarantee access to free health and education. The government is not going to consent to town-hall chicanery just to stop immigrant families getting health care or education for their children, said the Socialist prime minister, Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero. As many as 2.5m immigrants have arrived in Spain since he took office in 2004.
Both Vic and Torrejon de Ardoz eventually backtracked, but the row persists. Town halls are obliged to register even illegal immigrants. Now several parties are vying to sound tougher. They include the PP and Convergence and Union (CiU), the mainstream Catalan nationalist party. The law must be changed, says the PP's national leader, Mariano Rajoy, who says there are too many illegals. CiU, meanwhile, proposes an ill-defined system of rewards for well-behaved immigrants. 
Critics say this is all unnecessary scaremongering. A decade-long boom has seen Spain's immigrant population swell from 2% of the total to 12%, or 5.6m. Immigrants were big contributors to Spain's economic success. As new workers poured in, Spain arrived at levels of immigration similar to other big European countries, but in a quarter of the time. Integration has been only a partial success. There are almost no immigrant police officers. Black Africans still find some nightclubs closed to them. But friction is minimal. Even in Vic, where an anti-immigrant party came second in local elections, a poll puts immigrants (who make up 23% of the population) below parks and car parking as matters of local concern.
The outlook for Spain's immigrants has, however, deteriorated dramatically. Their unemployment rate, at 30%, is well above the national average. Spain might have a quarter of a million fewer unemployed people had it shut its doors when serious job losses began in 2008. That is the number of immigrants who came in to find jobs that never materialised.
Some have tried and failed to make immigration a political issue before. But a sea-change in political attitudes may be coming. Joaquin Arango, of Madrid's Complutense University, points out that the PP is an exception on the European right in that it has not turned immigration into a political battlefield. It would be natural for the right to behave more as it does elsewhere, he says. For the moment, Spaniards remember their own recent experience of emigration; they show no taste for big rows about immigration.

To this piffle the best retort is: grow up. It is true that Spain is not Greece. Its public debt, relative to the size of the economy, is lower than that of Britain or the United States. It has not had to bail out its banks. And fears of financial contagion have made the markets unnaturally volatile. But there are good reasons for investors to worry about Spain.

Without a faster return to growth, the public debt will quickly become unsustainable. 
To make matters worse, Mr Zapatero looks out of his depth. He was a popular leader in the good times, during Spain's long boom. But he failed to see the bust coming. When he belatedly recognised that the economy was in trouble, he misdiagnosed the problem as an imported recession that he could safely wait out.

They are one step ahead of the government, which has reacted with fumbling confusion, abruptly launching an austerity plan and a vague scheme for labour-market reform, only to withdraw bits of both at the first cheep of protest.
Many of Spain's troubles start at home. The boom relied on a housing bubble, and on the low interest rates that came with the euro. Growth will now have to come from investment in other parts of the economy and from exports. But relative to the rest of Europe, Spain has become a high-cost, low-productivity economy. Wage indexation has made businesses uncompetitive. Generous severance arrangements discourage firms from hiring workers and have created a two-tier labour market and mass unemployment. Years of buying off regional governments with cash and exaggerated devolution means that the central government now directly controls only a fifth of spending, while businesses must surmount sierras of overlapping regulation.

IT WAS the week Spanish Socialists would rather forget. Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero, Spain's prime minister, began it on January 28th at the World Economic Forum in Davos where he found himself sharing a platform with the leaders of Europe's lamest ducks, Greece and Latvia. Mr Zapatero had gone to Davos determined to instil confidence in his country, the only big developed economy still in recession. Instead, he raised more doubts, chiefly this one: is Mr Zapatero the man to lead Spain into recovery? 
At Davos he boldly announced proposals to raise the retirement age from 65 to 67. But that provoked fury from his trade union allies at home. Then his finance ministry sent a deficit-reduction plan to the European Commission. Union anger, however, forced it to be watered down. Mr Zapatero's next trick was to flag a package of proposals for labour reform, an issue on which he has stalled for almost two years. It turned out to leave all decision-making to employers and the unions, who of course disagree. 
In one poll, the prime minister's rating has slipped below that of his notoriously plodding main rival, Mariano Rajoy of the conservative People's Party (PP). In another, support for the Socialists slipped further, with the PP now holding a six-point lead. More than half of Socialist voters now have little or no confidence in him. Jose Maria Barreda, a Socialist who heads the regional government of Castilla-La Mancha, has called for ministerial heads to roll. But the government has encouraged Spaniards to see enemies abroad. ""Nothing that is happening, including the apocalyptic editorials in foreign media, is just chance. It's because it's in the interest of certain individuals,"" said Jose Blanco, the minister of public works. 
Mr Zapatero, now in his second term, lacks a majority in parliament. A solid pact with the moderate Catalan nationalists would greatly help his push for reforms, says Jonas Fernandez, an economist at Carlos III University. But the Catalans are wary of embracing a lame Mr Zapatero before an election for their regional government in the autumn. 
Mr Rajoy says he cannot bring the government down in parliament, because the balance of parties is too complicated. A leadership challenge from within Mr Zapatero's own party is unlikely. So he is likely to cling on until 2012. 
The prime minister seems haunted by the fact that his two predecessors faced general strikes in the twilight of their rule. Murmurs of a strike are being heard again. Even as he declared a new-found enthusiasm for economic reform this week, he sought to sugar this pill with further aid to the long-term unemployed. But keeping both bond markets and the unions happy is impossible.

At Davos he boldly announced proposals to raise the retirement age from 65 to 67. But that provoked fury from his trade union allies at home. Then his finance ministry sent a deficit-reduction plan to the European Commission. Union anger, however, forced it to be watered down. Mr Zapatero's next trick was to flag a package of proposals for labour reform, an issue on which he has stalled for almost two years. It turned out to leave all decision-making to employers and the unions, who of course disagree. 
In one poll, the prime minister's rating has slipped below that of his notoriously plodding main rival, Mariano Rajoy of the conservative People's Party (PP). In another, support for the Socialists slipped further, with the PP now holding a six-point lead. More than half of Socialist voters now have little or no confidence in him. Jose Maria Barreda, a Socialist who heads the regional government of Castilla-La Mancha, has called for ministerial heads to roll. But the government has encouraged Spaniards to see enemies abroad. ""Nothing that is happening, including the apocalyptic editorials in foreign media, is just chance. It's because it's in the interest of certain individuals,"" said Jose Blanco, the minister of public works. 
Mr Zapatero, now in his second term, lacks a majority in parliament. A solid pact with the moderate Catalan nationalists would greatly help his push for reforms, says Jonas Fernandez, an economist at Carlos III University. But the Catalans are wary of embracing a lame Mr Zapatero before an election for their regional government in the autumn. 
Mr Rajoy says he cannot bring the government down in parliament, because the balance of parties is too complicated. A leadership challenge from within Mr Zapatero's own party is unlikely. So he is likely to cling on until 2012. 
The prime minister seems haunted by the fact that his two predecessors faced general strikes in the twilight of their rule. Murmurs of a strike are being heard again. Even as he declared a new-found enthusiasm for economic reform this week, he sought to sugar this pill with further aid to the long-term unemployed. But keeping both bond markets and the unions happy is impossible.

ON A small plot of land near Candeleda, in Avila province, Antonio de la Cruz is planting tobacco. It is years since he grew anything. During Spain's decade-long boom, he worked on construction sites, which paid better. But building has ground to a halt. ""I've got to do something,"" he says. He is lucky: few of Spain's 4.3m unemployed (almost 20% of the workforce) have bits of land to plough.
A morale-boosting advertising campaign, backed by 18 large banks and companies, tells glum Spaniards that their problems can be fixed ""between us all"". The opposition People's Party disagrees. This has to be fixed by whoever broke it, says its spokesman, Esteban Gonzalez Pons. He means that the Socialist prime minister, Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero, should do the fixing--and that he is failing.
The list of things that need repair is extensive. Spain's structural faults were long hidden by a housing bubble and have been glaringly exposed now that it has burst. From unemployment and low productivity growth, and from troubled savings banks to creaky public finances, the problems are piling up. With the government unwilling to apply radical surgery, there are fears that Spain will fall further behind its neighbours. ""The risk is that we will have a lost decade, like Portugal or Japan,"" says Lorenzo Bernaldo de Quiros, an economist at Freemarket International Consulting in Madrid.
Unemployment tops most people's worries. Faster growth is needed to bring it down. Yet Spain has been in recession for seven quarters; the government expects GDP to shrink again this year; and the IMF forecasts growth of less than 1% in 2011. 
The public finances must also be fixed. Last year's deficit ballooned to over 11% of GDP. In January Elena Salgado, the finance minister, produced an outline of austerity measures that calmed market fears about Spanish debt. But two months later the plan still lacks detail--and has an obvious flaw. An optimistic Ms Salgado predicted growth of 3% in both 2012 and 2013, bringing added revenues to cut the deficit. Spain's European commissioner, Joaquin Almunia, has warned against the sin of over-optimism. Growth will not go over 2% until 2014, says Angel Laborda, an economist at FUNCAS, the savings banks' foundation. He reckons that more tax rises and spending cuts are inevitable if the government is to hit its 3% deficit target by 2013. 
Ms Salgado is already raising value-added tax, with the top rate going from 16% to 18% in July. Mr Zapatero says this will finance the unemployed. ""We can pay unemployment benefits to half a million people,"" he said in a television interview. Yet higher taxes will also dampen consumer spending, sending growth lower still.
Deeper reforms to Spain's economy look unlikely. The Bank of Spain's governor, Miguel Angel Fernandez Ordonez, is calling for reform of a rigid labour market that makes most employees too costly to fire but condemns a third of workers to unstable, unprotected temporary jobs. Yet the government has repeatedly delayed pension and labour reforms. Mr Zapatero's great goal is to conserve social peace. That means keeping trade unions happy, even if reforms (and growth) have to wait.
Some detect a whiff of cowardice. Mr Zapatero's determination to avoid general strikes is proof that he will never take a difficult decision, says Artur Mas, head of the Catalan Convergence and Union coalition. And because broad agreements on public-spending cuts lack detail, they also lack urgency. A recent austerity deal with regional governments, responsible for over a third of Spain's public spending, allows for two more months of haggling.
In the meantime Spain's financial sector is jibbing at reform plans. Some cajas (savings banks) are heavily exposed to construction and housing loans. Mr Ordonez says a third of the 45 cajas need to disappear (by being absorbed by others). A EUR 99 billion ($132 billion) rescue fund is producing only limited consolidation so far, with perhaps seven Catalan cajas merging into two. Local politicians, who have a big say in their cajas, do not want to lose power. The Bank of Spain must act urgently, says Luis Garicano of the London School of Economics. The system cannot improve so long as doomed entities are kept alive, says Miguel Martin, president of the Spanish Banking Association.
The delay in sorting out the cajas adds to the sense of drift. Most Spaniards do not see the economy improving any time soon. Faith in the political class is at rock bottom. The Spanish now rate politicians as a bigger problem than their old bugbear, terrorism. Mr Zapatero's Socialists are trailing in the polls--but an election is not due for two more years.

THE queues at Spanish employment offices have never been longer. For the first time since military service was scrapped in 2001, the army is near full strength. Picking up a gun and risking roadside bombs in Afghanistan is one answer to the problem faced by the 4m Spaniards who are jobless. Unemployment rose again in March, a month when it usually drops. The 36,000 extra jobless were fewer than in March last year, but they still helped push the unemployment rate even closer to 20%.
When unemployment began to rise 18 months ago, the Socialist prime minister, Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero, predicted that a job recovery would start at the end of 2009. He has since put his forecast back to the end of 2010. But the Bank of Spain says the turnaround may not actually come until the second half of 2011, when unemployment will hit 20%.
Spaniards are worried. As many as 42% say that unemployment has affected their lives. Some 3.2m are now on unemployment benefit. More than 400,000 long-term unemployed draw just EUR 426 ($570) a month. Their numbers will rise as the more generous benefits, based on previous earnings, run out after two years. Things are particularly grim for immigrants and the young. Some 40% of under-25s are unemployed, twice as many as in other hard-hit European countries. Sebastian Mora, secretary-general of a Roman Catholic charity, Caritas, talks of a crisis of despair. Caritas's workload of those needing its help has doubled in two years. 
When the unemployment numbers burst through the 3m mark at the end of 2008, a senior trade unionist said that 4m would provoke a social revolution. Plenty of conservative pundits similarly predicted riots on Spanish streets. Yet the 4m mark has now been reached and neither rioting nor social revolution has broken out. Even crime rates remain relatively low, despite a squeeze on hiring police officers (for which there are 30 applicants for every job). 
Why? Spain has a historically high tolerance of unemployment. Strong family networks help to ease the pain. Mr Zapatero's supporters also claim that he deserves credit for widening unemployment benefits, even though this has increased the budget deficit. And a vigorous and growing underground (black) economy makes a big difference. The tax inspectors' union, Gestha, believes that it accounts for more than 23% of GDP and that it grew by 0.7% last year when recorded GDP shrank by 3.1%. The black economy is especially attractive to those still receiving unemployment benefits based on previous earnings. They are often reluctant to go back into formal work until the two-year payment period is over.
Spain has Europe's most volatile labour market. It has destroyed jobs quickly, but not long ago it was also creating them in unprecedented numbers. Even now, Spain has created more jobs (net) since 2000 than any other big European country, points out Emiliano Carluccio of Carlos III University. But many of those jobs depended on a frothy construction industry. Short of knocking down the million unsold new homes left after the property bubble burst, that will not pick up for many years. In fact, construction is still adding to the dole queues, as projects started before the bust come to an end.
Spain has seen unemployment rise faster than even America and Ireland, where firing is relatively cheap. A Bank of Spain study suggests that this is down to a two-tier labour market, which condemns a third of the workforce to a merry-go-round of unstable, temporary jobs while the rest enjoy ironclad permanent contracts. Miguel Angel Fernandez Ordonez, the central bank's governor, is among the loudest voices calling for labour reform. 
Yet Mr Zapatero has made clear he will not impose this on reluctant unions. And they show little appetite for more than blowing life into an existing but rarely used special contract that reduces the cost of firing permanent employees from 45 days pay per year worked to 33 days.
Mr Carluccio points out that a two-tier labour market is matched by two-tier education. Spain equals other European countries in numbers with university-level education, but a shocking 30% of Spaniards leave school with no qualifications--worse than elsewhere. These people find it hardest to get work. You can see why so many apply to the army, says Mr Carluccio; you don't need a master's degree.

THE economy has stalled. One in five workers is jobless. The Socialist government of Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero is pilloried for its slow reactions. So why are Spaniards not switching in droves to the opposition People's Party (PP)? Recent polls give the PP a lead of between four and six points. That is not enough to win back the absolute majority the party lost in 2004, when Mr Zapatero came to power. 
There are two reasons for Spaniards' scepticism towards the PP. One is corruption. Two court cases point to its existence even at quite senior levels. ""It is clear that Mr Matas is among us to mock mere mortals,"" a magistrate said of Jaume Matas, once a PP minister and a former president of the Balearic Islands government, as he set bail on March 30th. Mr Matas who is being investigated over allegations that money went missing from a public contract to build a cycling stadium in Mallorca, has resigned, temporarily, from the PP. So has Luis Barcenas, the party treasurer, who is under investigation in a different case.
Both men protest their innocence. But Spaniards see the PP as tolerant of misbehavers. There has been no illegal party funding, just a few people who have broken the law, said the party leader, Mariano Rajoy. Officials from all of Spain's big parties are being investigated for corruption, but the PP cases reveal a taste for ostentatious luxury. Fast cars, sharp suits and Cartier watches look bad in a recession. Both cases may drag on, with ever more revelations, until the 2012 election.
The second reason for voters' doubts is Mr Rajoy himself. Pleasant, but bland, his popularity lags behind Mr Zapatero's. Almost two-thirds of Spaniards see him as weak on corruption. Only one in five approves of the way he leads the party. He has already led the PP to two election defeats. A former property registrar from Galicia, Mr Rajoy shares Galicians' legendary ability to disguise his intentions. An appreciable majority of Spaniards tell pollsters he has no clear plans for the future.
Yet behind Mr Rajoy's affable exterior is a clear-headed strategist and a proven survivor. His toughest battles have been within the PP. Early on as opposition leader he faced down others. The corruption scandals, none of which involve Mr Rajoy, may have strengthened his hand. Potential rivals, including the regional presidents of Madrid and Valencia, Esperanza Aguirre and Francisco Camps, are too busy limiting local damage to plot against him. And Mr Rajoy has also toned down his anti-Zapatero rhetoric. No longer does the PP bang on about the government tearing Spain apart, selling out to Basque terrorists or destroying the family.
Instead, highlighting the poor state of the economy may be enough. Deficit-cutting and labour-market reform would be priorities for a PP government. The party's economic strategists predict only a small recovery in tax revenues. A housing bubble that burst in 2008 means many households cannot easily increase their taxable spending. That makes cuts in public spending more urgent, they say. The next election is two years off. The less Mr Zapatero does about the economy, the more disenchanted voters may become. People believe the right manages the economy better, says Luis Arroyo, a political consultant. In theory, Mr Rajoy should still win. But Mr Zapatero is also a skilled political operator. The PP should watch out for surprises.

FOR weeks, Europe's policymakers have stood accused of doing too little, too late as the sovereign-debt crisis that engulfed Greece threatened to spread to Portugal, Spain, Ireland and perhaps elsewhere. By May 7th, as yields on vulnerable euro-area countries' government bonds rose sharply, there seemed to be a real threat that foreign financing for these countries would stop. That in turn raised fears about the exposure of banks to European governments and private borrowers. Europe's Lehman moment, it seemed, might be at hand.
The European Union's policymakers were forced to act with unaccustomed speed and unprecedented force. In the early hours of May 10th finance ministers, meeting in Brussels, agreed on an extensive scheme of repairs for the euro zone. The biggest stack of financial scaffolding is a ""stabilisation fund"", worth up to EUR 500 billion ($635 billion). This includes EUR 60 billion to be financed by EU bonds that can be sold fairly quickly--as much as can be raised over three years without breaching the union's budget ceiling. This element had to be approved by EU members, such as Britain, which do not use the euro, because their taxpayers would also be on the hook were the money not repaid in full. (It is an extension of a similar EUR 50 billion fund for non-euro countries with balance-of-payments problems.) The stabilisation fund would be supplemented by up to EUR 250 billion more from the IMF.
In addition, the European Central Bank (ECB) said it would purchase government bonds to restore calm to ""dysfunctional"" markets. It will offer banks unlimited cash at a fixed interest rate at its next two scheduled three-month financing operations on May 26th and June 30th. The ECB also reopened credit lines that had been put in place in the autumn of 2008, in post-Lehman days, with the Federal Reserve, the Bank of England, the Bank of Canada and the Swiss National Bank, so that it will be able to lend European banks dollars and other currencies.
Financial markets' initial response was euphoric. Germany's stockmarket closed more than 5% higher on May 10th. France's main index went up by almost 10%: big French banks are heavily exposed to Greece, so they stand to benefit from a guarantee of rescue. The yield on ten-year Greek government bonds plunged from more than 12% to less than 8%. Yields on comparable Irish, Italian, Portuguese and Spanish bonds also fell sharply--mostly, it seems, because of purchases by the ECB (see chart 1 on the next page).
However, this giddy joy soon gave way to a more sober view, for three main reasons. First, the rescue plan has a patched-together feel. Many of the details are still missing. Second, the fact that the ECB is buying the debt of euro-area governments raises questions about the central bank's much-trumpeted independence of politicians--and hence about its credibility as an inflation-fighter. And third, the package, impressive though its scale and speed may be, only buys time for troubled governments to cut their budget deficits and put in place structural reforms needed to improve their lost export competitiveness. If that time is wasted, even worse trouble may lie ahead for the euro zone's policymakers and their fellow citizens. International rescue
Start with the rescue plan. Its mainstay is the promise of up to EUR 440 billion over three years from a ""special-purpose vehicle"" to be set up by the 16 euro-zone countries, which will control the disbursement of money and guarantee the vehicle's financing. The scheme is open to EU countries that do not use the euro: Poland and Sweden say they will sign up to it; Britain says it will not. At Germany's insistence the money will be raised and overseen by governments. The Germans do not want Eurocrats raising and handing out too much money without close monitoring from national capitals.
That much is plain. Further details of the scheme's workings, however, remain sketchy. It is not clear, for instance, whether the pool will raise money in anticipation of a funding emergency or only when it is needed, which is how the balance-of-payments fund operates. The interest rate to be charged for access to funds has not been decided--a detail that delayed the Greek rescue package for weeks.
The IMF has not yet spelled out the precise size and nature of its promised contribution (
), although it seems that some finance ministers were in contact with fund officials during the late-night talks. The ministers expect the IMF to chip in ""at least half as much"" as European countries, just as it did for the rescue of Greece and, before that, for Latvia. 
These elements of the rescue plan would take a while to become fully operational--too long, perhaps, for jittery financial markets to wait. That is what made the ECB's participation necessary: it is the only institution that could react rapidly enough. However, the role of the central bank raises a second set of concerns.
Some of these are easier to assuage than others. By buying government bonds, the ECB is pumping money into the economy. This is potentially inflationary. However, the central bank says it will soak up the cash, for instance by selling instruments of its own, so that monetary policy will not in fact be loosened. 
More niggling is the suspicion that the ECB has caved in to political pressure to help out spendthrift governments. As recently as May 6th, Jean-Claude Trichet, the central bank's president, said that the ECB's 22-strong governing council had not even discussed buying bonds at its regular monetary-policy meeting. Four days later the bank was doing just that. Not every member of the council was happy with the change of heart, even though Mr Trichet insisted it was backed by an ""overwhelming majority"". Axel Weber, the head of the Bundesbank, Germany's central bank, and a leading candidate to succeed Mr Trichet when he steps down next year, voiced his criticism to Borsen-Zeitung, a German financial newspaper.
Mr Trichet has denied that the ECB was pressured into buying bonds, saying that the central bank was ""fiercely and totally independent"". Yet the ECB looks a different animal from what it was when the fiscal crisis began. Last year it balked at buying government bonds when other central banks were doing so as an emergency extension of monetary policy--ie, to hold down the interest rates at which firms and households could borrow and to get money flowing through the banking system. Now it finds itself providing explicit support for European governments' fiscal policies, which is a far bigger threat to its reputation for independence. It is influencing the borrowing costs of euro-zone governments directly, without much of a guide to what the rates on their bonds should be.
This is not the only sharp U-turn Mr Trichet has had to perform recently. He opposed the IMF's involvement in the Greek rescue, then welcomed it. And he said the central bank's rules on what constituted acceptable collateral should not be altered to suit one country, only to change them to ensure that Greek bonds could be exchanged by banks for ECB cash. The central bank's credibility relies in part on a reputation for living up to its pledges and partly on its disdain for political expediency. On both counts, it has lost something. 
The loss need not be fatal. As one senior policymaker puts it, it is one thing to be independent of politicians but quite another to have discussions with them in a crisis. It was the flaws in the construction of the euro that forced Mr Trichet's hand, not a lack of fortitude under political pressure. The ECB had to step in to head off the threat of a run on Irish, Portuguese and Spanish bonds (and maybe some banks) because no other euro-zone institution could do so. Equally, the ECB could scarcely refuse Greek government bonds as collateral for central-bank money even if they were junk. To do so would be to deny Greece one of the privileges of membership. It might even have been illegal. Gouvernement economique
The third cause for concern is what the euro area's governments will do with the time the rescue package buys them. Already, countries that have been dilatory in cutting their deficits have pledged to be more resolute. Portugal's government, which clocked up a deficit of 9.4% of GDP last year, has said it will delay plans to build a new airport, to follow a recent promise of cuts in unemployment insurance. On May 12th the Spanish prime minister, Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero, announced that civil servants' pay would be cut by 5% from June and frozen next year. Ministers' pay will be slashed by 15%. It is hoped that this and other measures, including a EUR 6 billion reduction in public investment, will cut Spain's budget deficit from 11.2% of GDP last year to just over 6% in 2011. ""The situation is difficult and it would be nonsense to hide it,"" said Mr Zapatero. 
However, keeping up the pressure on countries with big deficits may prove difficult with a safety net in place. After all, the rescue package is, in effect, an attempt by policymakers to convince investors that euro-zone sovereign debts are collectively insured: the debts of one are guaranteed by all. The idea that the EUR 440 billion scheme will be retired after three years is hard to believe: it is difficult to withdraw a guarantee once it has been given. All governments, even that of reluctant Germany, understand that they have taken a step towards a kind of fiscal federalism. Indeed euro-zone policymakers are now scrambling to claim the plan as their own so that they can set the terms for the economic co-ordination and surveillance that it entails.
For many, the fallout from the Greek crisis has proved what they had suspected all along: that the euro zone needs more fiscal co-ordination in order to work. If its members are to underwrite each other's debts, they will demand more say in each other's budget plans. The stability and growth pact, the scheme that was meant to limit euro-area countries' budget deficits to 3% of GDP and public debt to 60% of GDP, has clearly failed. 
That still leaves Europe's policymakers grappling with the problem of how to impose fiscal discipline. On May 12th the European Commission set out proposals for strengthening the EU's ""economic governance"". The commission said budget plans and economic reforms should be subject to peer review before they reach national parliaments. Breaches of budgetary rules should be punished faster--by withholding funds from the EU budget or by fines, placed in an interest-bearing account pending remedial action. It is easy to think of other possible sanctions but harder to work out how they could be imposed. 
Lax countries could be threatened with harsher terms on borrowing from pooled funds. Sinners could lose access to ECB support. The trouble is, these sorts of threats are empty as long as they impose costs on those who would dole out punishment. Fiscal surveillance in the euro area has failed because the punishers fret that one day they might be the punished, or because the strong financial links between euro-area countries mean that any punishment would undermine the currency zone's stability.
Budgetary discipline will be only one part of euro-zone surveillance--and perhaps not the most important part. The commission also wants to monitor trade imbalances and the build-up of foreign debts. Greece, Ireland, Portugal and Spain have become heavily reliant on foreign capital, racking up big current-account deficits year after year (see chart 2 on the previous page) and hence accumulating ever larger foreign debts. Portugal is deepest in hock: its net international debt (what it owes, less its foreign assets) rose to 112% of GDP last year. Roughly half of that total was public debt. Spain, Greece and Ireland are also heavily in debt.
What makes this problem so acute is that very little of the foreign capital in these countries is greenfield direct investments, like new factories, or purchases of shares in big firms listed on stockmarkets--the kind of money that tends to stick around and can bear losses. The bulk of it is either government bonds or short-term money that has been funnelled through the banking system to fund mortgages and loans to small firms, and is more likely to disappear in a crisis. Portuguese banks' net foreign debts were around 46% of GDP last year. These credit lines need to be rolled over regularly and their price and availability depend on the creditworthiness of the government. In the fallout from the Greek crisis, the market's confidence about Ireland, Portugal and Spain was draining away. As the yields on their government bonds rose at the end of last week, there seemed to be a real threat that foreign financing would come to a sudden halt.
Dependence on foreign capital in these countries is both symptom and cause of a deeper problem: a lack of export competitiveness. Cheap foreign credit fuelled the booms in domestic demand in Greece, Spain and Ireland in the years after the euro's launch in 1999. That pushed up unit-wage costs relative to those in the rest of the euro area (notably super-competitive Germany) and cost competitiveness declined steadily (see chart 3). Consumer booms also skewed industrial structures away from firms that export to those that serve the domestic market and are more sheltered from foreign competition. 
Reversing those trends will be hard, but essential if countries are to service their foreign debts from export earnings. Devaluation, the usual route to rebalancing, is not open to countries in the euro area. They must find ways of cutting labour costs and boosting productivity. Ireland has already reduced wages; Spain made a start this week. Granted, lower wages will make mortgage debts harder to service. But the choice is between lower wages and higher unemployment, which is already in double digits in Portugal and Ireland and close to 20% in Spain. It will not be easy to dismantle Portugal's and Spain's complex wage-setting agreements, which set a floor to industry pay. But firms, especially small ones, should be allowed to opt out of such arrangements so that they can better match labour costs to productivity. Export or die
Policy should also be directed at shifting resources to exporters. One complaint in Portugal is that the monopolistic state of some service industries serves only to reinforce existing imbalances. The best graduates want to work for telephone and energy companies because they pay well, thanks to the profitability that comes from market power. The lack of competition imposes costs on firms, including exporters, which are forced to use their services; and weak competition reduces productivity more generally. That makes measures to boost competition in services all the more vital. A report on strengthening the single market by Mario Monti, a former EU commissioner, was issued on May 10th. 
Tax policy can also help, where fiscal consolidation allows it. Increasing levies on spending, such as value-added taxes, while reducing taxes on jobs would shift economies away from domestic demand, mimicking a devaluation. Countries that habitually run a trade surplus (Germany, Belgium, the Netherlands and Finland) need to mirror the reforms in deficit changes with policies to promote stronger domestic demand and a shift away from an emphasis on exporting industries.
The transition to a more competitive economy will be painful. Politicians have not prepared electorates for difficult times. Running up debts is fun; paying them off is not. In an ideal world, the pain of a structural-reform programme would be cushioned by an expansionary fiscal policy. That is a luxury that Spain, Portugal and the rest can no longer afford.
The fall in the euro will help. It cannot help high-wage countries compete with Germany, but it gives their firms a chance against imports from outside the euro zone. Economic logic as well as market sentiment points to further euro weakness. Business cycles favour it: America's recovery is more advanced than Europe's. Figures released on May 12th showed that the euro-area economy grew by 0.2% in the first quarter: America's economy expanded four times as quickly.
Monetary conditions should also hold the euro down. The pressure to tighten fiscal policy in some parts of the euro area will make it hard for the ECB even to consider raising interest rates. That will weigh on the euro and will also help indebted households in Spain, Portugal and Ireland, where mortgage rates tend to track the ECB's benchmark interest rate. The euro is still dear against the dollar on gauges such as purchasing-power parity, notwithstanding its recent slide.
The measures announced this week offer countries a chance, perhaps their last one, to put things right. There are some hopeful signs. Portugal started to introduce some modest reforms to jobs and product markets after 2005. Its economy grew by an impressive 1.7% in the year to the first quarter--about as fast as Germany's--which suggests that its efforts to reorient itself may be paying off.
It would be wrong to conclude that, in trying to get ahead of the crisis, the euro zone's policymakers have already gone too far. The threat that Portugal and Spain might be cut off from credit markets, triggering a meltdown in Europe's financial system, was all too real. The rescue effort will dent the ECB's reputation as a single-minded inflation-slayer. There is still a risk that the insurance provided by the rescue scheme may leave countries that benefit from it a bit less minded to cut deficits and reform their economies. But those faults, real as they are, must be set against the potential costs of doing nothing.",230,Spain,"A promised huge rescue fund and central-bank help for indebted governments have eased the euro area's crisis. The respite must be used wisely
FOR weeks, Europe's policymakers have stood accused of doing too little, too late as the sovereign-debt crisis that engulfed Greece threatened to spread to Portugal, Spain, Ireland and perhaps elsewhere. By May 7th, as yields on vulnerable euro-area countries' government bonds rose sharply, there seemed to be a real threat that foreign financing for these countries would stop. That in turn raised fears about the exposure of banks to European governments and private borrowers. Europe's Lehman moment, it seemed, might be at hand.
The European Union's policymakers were forced to act with unaccustomed speed and unprecedented force. In the early hours of May 10th finance ministers, meeting in Brussels, agreed on an extensive scheme of repairs for the euro zone. The biggest stack of financial scaffolding is a ""stabilisation fund"", worth up to EUR 500 billion ($635 billion). This includes EUR 60 billion to be financed by EU bonds that can be sold fairly quickly--as much as can be raised over three years without breaching the union's budget ceiling. This element had to be approved by EU members, such as Britain, which do not use the euro, because their taxpayers would also be on the hook were the money not repaid in full. (It is an extension of a similar EUR 50 billion fund for non-euro countries with balance-of-payments problems.) The stabilisation fund would be supplemented by up to EUR 250 billion more from the IMF.
In addition, the European Central Bank (ECB) said it would purchase government bonds to restore calm to ""dysfunctional"" markets. It will offer banks unlimited cash at a fixed interest rate at its next two scheduled three-month financing operations on May 26th and June 30th. The ECB also reopened credit lines that had been put in place in the autumn of 2008, in post-Lehman days, with the Federal Reserve, the Bank of England, the Bank of Canada and the Swiss National Bank, so that it will be able to lend European banks dollars and other currencies.
Financial markets' initial response was euphoric. Germany's stockmarket closed more than 5% higher on May 10th. France's main index went up by almost 10%: big French banks are heavily exposed to Greece, so they stand to benefit from a guarantee of rescue. The yield on ten-year Greek government bonds plunged from more than 12% to less than 8%. Yields on comparable Irish, Italian, Portuguese and Spanish bonds also fell sharply--mostly, it seems, because of purchases by the ECB (see chart 1 on the next page).
However, this giddy joy soon gave way to a more sober view, for three main reasons. First, the rescue plan has a patched-together feel. Many of the details are still missing. Second, the fact that the ECB is buying the debt of euro-area governments raises questions about the central bank's much-trumpeted independence of politicians--and hence about its credibility as an inflation-fighter. And third, the package, impressive though its scale and speed may be, only buys time for troubled governments to cut their budget deficits and put in place structural reforms needed to improve their lost export competitiveness. If that time is wasted, even worse trouble may lie ahead for the euro zone's policymakers and their fellow citizens. International rescue
Start with the rescue plan. Its mainstay is the promise of up to EUR 440 billion over three years from a ""special-purpose vehicle"" to be set up by the 16 euro-zone countries, which will control the disbursement of money and guarantee the vehicle's financing. The scheme is open to EU countries that do not use the euro: Poland and Sweden say they will sign up to it; Britain says it will not. At Germany's insistence the money will be raised and overseen by governments. The Germans do not want Eurocrats raising and handing out too much money without close monitoring from national capitals.
That much is plain. Further details of the scheme's workings, however, remain sketchy. It is not clear, for instance, whether the pool will raise money in anticipation of a funding emergency or only when it is needed, which is how the balance-of-payments fund operates. The interest rate to be charged for access to funds has not been decided--a detail that delayed the Greek rescue package for weeks.
The IMF has not yet spelled out the precise size and nature of its promised contribution (
), although it seems that some finance ministers were in contact with fund officials during the late-night talks. The ministers expect the IMF to chip in ""at least half as much"" as European countries, just as it did for the rescue of Greece and, before that, for Latvia. 
These elements of the rescue plan would take a while to become fully operational--too long, perhaps, for jittery financial markets to wait. That is what made the ECB's participation necessary: it is the only institution that could react rapidly enough. However, the role of the central bank raises a second set of concerns.
Some of these are easier to assuage than others. By buying government bonds, the ECB is pumping money into the economy. This is potentially inflationary. However, the central bank says it will soak up the cash, for instance by selling instruments of its own, so that monetary policy will not in fact be loosened. 
More niggling is the suspicion that the ECB has caved in to political pressure to help out spendthrift governments. As recently as May 6th, Jean-Claude Trichet, the central bank's president, said that the ECB's 22-strong governing council had not even discussed buying bonds at its regular monetary-policy meeting. Four days later the bank was doing just that. Not every member of the council was happy with the change of heart, even though Mr Trichet insisted it was backed by an ""overwhelming majority"". Axel Weber, the head of the Bundesbank, Germany's central bank, and a leading candidate to succeed Mr Trichet when he steps down next year, voiced his criticism to Borsen-Zeitung, a German financial newspaper.
Mr Trichet has denied that the ECB was pressured into buying bonds, saying that the central bank was ""fiercely and totally independent"". Yet the ECB looks a different animal from what it was when the fiscal crisis began. Last year it balked at buying government bonds when other central banks were doing so as an emergency extension of monetary policy--ie, to hold down the interest rates at which firms and households could borrow and to get money flowing through the banking system. Now it finds itself providing explicit support for European governments' fiscal policies, which is a far bigger threat to its reputation for independence. It is influencing the borrowing costs of euro-zone governments directly, without much of a guide to what the rates on their bonds should be.

As he set out cuts in civil-service pay, social programmes and pensions, Mr Zapatero had the look of a man who has seen the writing on the wall. Yet his political death will take time. The next election is not due until 2012, and a fractious opposition seems unable to topple his minority government. He will call the shots for almost two more years.

Mr Zapatero is skilled at sounding as if he means business, but his record is of painful slowness to deliver. Only a shove by the markets, the European Union or, on this occasion, America's Barack Obama, can get him to act against his left-wing instincts. His May 12th plans, included a 5% cut in civil-service pay and the freezing of pensions next year, but he also wants higher taxes on the rich. He has made clear that the unpopular 2011 pensions freeze will not affect a top-up payment for this year's inflation if it is over 1%. The cuts were welcomed by other euro-zone leaders anxious to avert a Spanish debt crisis. Spain's economy, accounting for 12% of the euro zone, is four times as big as Greece's. It is genuinely too big to fail.
Spain's rigid labour market must be reformed to reduce unemployment of 20% and also to help those on temporary contracts. Negotiations with unions and employers are under way. It will take a short time to finish the job, Mr Zapatero said this week. Yet labour reform has been promised before. Pension reform, including a later retirement age proposed by Mr Zapatero four months ago, has drifted into the background. He shows no willingness to force reforms past the unions. He will do what he has to do, but always the minimum and without enthusiasm, says Jose Luis Alvarez, of the ESADE business school. 
Mr Zapatero's presidential style of government is a problem. As ministers lose power, nobody is left to read him the riot act on the economy. It took not just Mr Obama but a series of late-night EU meetings to get him to face up to Spain's fiscal hole. More pressure may be needed to keep him up to the mark. Most Spaniards will accept cuts because they like the EU and the euro. Yet prolonged austerity will drain Mr Zapatero's support on the left. The unions plan strikes even though they have a more sympathetic ear in Mr Zapatero than in the right-wing People's Party. 
Before the cuts, Mr Zapatero's Socialists were only 1.5 points behind the PP in the polls. Afterwards, the PP's lead widened to nine points. The PP leader, Mariano Rajoy, has criticised the pension freeze. This may just be a cynical attempt to win votes. But the PP's suggested alternative cuts could prove useful if Mr Zapatero has to keep slicing. They include reducing ministries and scrapping pork-barrel deals agreed with Basque nationalists. 
The PP's attacks contrast with the centre-right Social Democrats in Portugal, who firmly back the spending cuts and tax rise planned by the Socialist prime minister, Jose Socrates. And the Social Democrats are still ahead in the polls.

The PP leader, Mariano Rajoy, has criticised the pension freeze. This may just be a cynical attempt to win votes. But the PP's suggested alternative cuts could prove useful if Mr Zapatero has to keep slicing. They include reducing ministries and scrapping pork-barrel deals agreed with Basque nationalists. 
The PP's attacks contrast with the centre-right Social Democrats in Portugal, who firmly back the spending cuts and tax rise planned by the Socialist prime minister, Jose Socrates. And the Social Democrats are still ahead in the polls.

This was the first show of union muscle since the country's Socialist prime minister, Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero, announced a EUR 15 billion ($18 billion) two-year austerity package last month.

Some 12% at most, said central and regional governments, and their figures looked more reliable. With a few exceptions, public services did not come to a standstill. Trains, planes and ports mostly functioned. So did schools and hospitals. At least one foreign visitor who flew in and out of Madrid that day failed to notice a strike was on. Madrid's regional government, which runs schools and hospitals, said only 8% of workers stayed away. That is less than half those who call in sick, or find other reasons not to work, on a normal day. It also represents just four strikers for every full-time union official on the region's payroll. 
Will Mr Zapatero really face a general strike after his labour-reform announcement next week? Such a move could be a disaster for his former allies in the unions, says one senior Spanish banker.

The measures of the reform decree reflect Mr Zapatero's attempt to triangulate between the demands of three groups.

WILL the European Union make it? The question would have sounded outlandish not long ago. Now even the project's greatest cheerleaders talk of a continent facing a ""Bermuda triangle"" of debt, demographic decline and lower growth.
As well as those chronic problems, the EU faces an acute crisis in its economic core, the 16 countries that use the single currency. Markets have lost faith that the euro zone's economies, weaker or stronger, will one day converge thanks to the discipline of sharing a single currency, which denies uncompetitive stragglers the quick fix of devaluation.
Yet the debate about how to save Europe's single currency from disintegration is stuck. It is stuck because the euro zone's dominant powers, France and Germany, agree on the need for greater harmonisation within the euro zone, but disagree about what to harmonise. 
Germany thinks the euro must be saved by stricter rules on borrowing, spending and competitiveness, backed by quasi-automatic sanctions for governments that stray. These might include threats to freeze EU funds for poorer regions and EU mega-projects, and even the suspension of a country's voting rights in EU ministerial councils. It insists that economic co-ordination should involve all 27 members of the EU club, among whom there is a small majority for free-market liberalism and economic rigour; in the inner core alone, Germany fears, a small majority favour French dirigisme.
A ""southern"" camp headed by France wants something different: ""European economic government"" within an inner core of euro-zone members. Translated, that means politicians meddling in monetary policy and a system of redistribution from richer to poorer members, via cheaper borrowing for governments through common Eurobonds or outright fiscal transfers. Finally, figures close to the French government have murmured, euro-zone members should agree to some fiscal and social harmonisation: eg, curbing competition in corporate-tax rates or labour costs. 
It is too soon to write off the EU. It remains the world's largest trading block. At its best, the European project is remarkably liberal: built around a single market of 27 rich and poor countries, its internal borders are far more porous to goods, capital and labour than any comparable trading area. It is an ambitious attempt to blunt the sharpest edges of globalisation, and make capitalism benign.
The problem is that the ""European social model"" has become, too often, a synonym for a very expensive way of doing things. It has also become an end in itself, with some EU leaders calling for Europe to grow purely in order to maintain its social-welfare systems. That is a pretty depressing call to arms: become more dynamic so Europe can still afford old-age pensions and unemployment benefits. 
Europe is in desperate need of good ideas and leadership. Too many EU leaders have tried to secure voter consent for bailing out weak links like Greece by murmuring darkly about ""Anglo-Saxon"" conspiracies to destroy the euro, and presenting bail-out mechanisms as a way to impose the will of the state over ""speculators"". Imaginary enemies are a desperate ruse to provide the union with coherence. The meltdown that wasn't
Two scenarios can be plausibly sketched out for Europe in the near term: one surprisingly positive, the other more negative. A positive scenario starts with the fact that things could be much worse. Think back 18 months or so, to a grim period marked by violent anti-government protests in Greece, Latvia, Bulgaria and Lithuania. The head of the Spanish confederation of employers' organisations, CEOE, could be heard suggesting it might be time for the free-market economy to take a ""time out"", to allow for government intervention. Politicians in Spain and Britain pressed bailed-out banks to lend first to domestic businesses and consumers. Greek authorities urged local banks to be ""prudent"" about transferring capital to Balkan subsidiaries. 
A senior official later identified an EU summit in December 2008 as the moment of maximum danger for the free-market cause. At a leaders' dinner Nicolas Sarkozy, France's president, berated the European Commission for applying EU rules too rigidly. All around him, heads nodded. If a show of hands had been called, the senior figure felt, an ""overwhelming majority"" of EU leaders would have voted to suspend the union's internal-market rules.
In France spooked aides to Mr Sarkozy said a ""European May 1968"" was brewing. Their boss suggested that billions of euros in aid for the French car industry should be linked to keeping production in France. It was, Mr Sarkozy explained, ""not justified"" for French firms to make cars for French drivers in Slovak factories. Alarmed at signs of growing east-west division, the Polish prime minister, Donald Tusk, declared that the European ship was ""rocking"", and ""they're going to start throwing the weaker passengers overboard.""
Mr Sarkozy's protectionism was mostly virtual, it turned out. French car firms continue to design thrifty little cars at home, while building them in lower-cost Slovenia, Romania or the Czech Republic. And the feared waves of civil unrest never came. From Greece to Spain or Ireland, protests and strikes have--to date--been smaller than expected, and dominated by public-sector workers with unusually safe jobs to protect.
In October 2009 the European Commission intervened after Germany was caught offering aid to sweeten the sale of Opel, a struggling carmaker, to a consortium pledging to keep open all four Opel factories in Germany (at the expense of more efficient plants elsewhere). The sale later fell through. On the one hand, it was worrying that Germany tried. On the other, it was a striking display of the power of the EU single market: the German government was told it could not spend taxpayers' money to keep jobs in Germany, without offering equal support to Opel factories in Spain, Belgium, Hungary or Britain.
The single currency was always supposed to drive structural reforms, as once-profligate countries were forced by the rules, and their peers, to live within their means. Instead, France and Germany led a rebellion against the disciplines of the ""stability and growth pact"" on the first occasion it looked about to catch them. That signalled a free-for-all. Less competitive members of the euro zone, notably in the ""Club Med"" countries, stood idly by as easy credit fuelled debt and asset bubbles, all the while allowing wages to soar. With some mortgage rates turning negative in real terms, it all felt like free money.
But northerners are also guilty of hypocrisy: it was German and French banks that led the way in lending to Greece or Spain. Lenders assumed that euro-zone sovereign debt was all rock-solid. For those pocketing the extra yields on southern bonds, that too felt like free money. In the words of one senior German, the root cause of the sovereign credit crisis in the euro zone was that markets at last ""realised that giving credit to Greece is riskier than giving credit to Austria.""
Northern governments also blocked early attempts at peer pressure. EU leaders, it is said, knew Greece was lying about its deficit figures back in 2008. Yet attempts to confront the then Greek prime minister, Costas Karamanlis, a conservative, came to nothing. Mr Karamanlis was shielded by fellow centre-right leaders, including some of those who now shout loudest for budgetary discipline.
Lessons do seem to have been learned. German officials say there is now bitter regret in Berlin that their country helped wreck the original stability and growth pact. But wrecked it was. Doing the right thing
European governments have nagged each other to carry out structural reforms for years, without great success. As Jean-Claude Juncker, prime minister of Luxembourg, said memorably in 2007: ""We all know what to do, but we don't know how to get re-elected once we have done it.""
Now, with markets shunning some Euro-laggards, doing the right thing is a matter of survival. Long-stuck dossiers are finally moving. On July 1st the European Commission announced plans to ram through an EU-wide patent valid in all 27 countries (a key demand of European business), after years of delays by Spain and Italy over the status given to their languages.
Earlier this year, EU leaders like Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero of Spain said flatly that market pressure on Spanish debt was a conspiracy. ""There is an attack under way by speculators against the euro, against tougher financial regulation of the financial system and of the markets,"" he claimed. But with market pressures reaching crisis point in May, Mr Zapatero reversed course, announcing civil-service pay cuts and other austerity measures. He unveiled a (modest) plan to ease Spain's rigid labour laws, which make older workers almost unsackable, leaving young and immigrant workers on temporary contracts to take the pain when Spain's property-led boom turned to bust. At 40%, youth unemployment in Spain is not just high; it is a moral indictment of an entire system.
At an EU summit in June, Mr Zapatero led calls for the publication of stress tests on European banks, a long-overdue measure being resisted by some in Germany. While still grumbling about unfounded rumours in financial markets (and he has a point), a more realistic Mr Zapatero argued: ""There is nothing better than transparency to demonstrate solvency.""
Crucially for those who believe in a happy ending to this crisis, voters seem made of sterner stuff than politicians feared, and can also see the need for structural reforms. Between 2005 and 2030 the working-age population of the European Union will shrink by 20m, and the number of those over 65 will increase by 40m. Thanks to the focus on crumbling public finances, that demographic time-bomb is now a common part of European public debate. Governments in places like Britain or the Netherlands have been able to propose paying pensions at 67 or even 70, without angry protests.
Even in France, where most voters told an opinion poll in June they considered a proposal to increase the retirement age to 62 ""unjust"", few dispute the idea that the current state-pension system faces insolvency. The left and right merely disagree about who should pay to fix this. In Greece, the most disruptive strikes have been staged by hardline Communist trade unions, with larger unions showing some restraint. The press, meanwhile, is filled with commentaries about how the country must live within its means, and how much things must change.
Some of Europe's most stubborn structural problems involve the misallocation of public spending. Governments have spent years padding civil-service payrolls, unveiling benefits like baby bonuses or early-retirement payments just before elections, and shovelling subsidies to politically powerful interest-groups.
Optimists have grounds for hoping that a squeeze on public spending will bring about some structural reforms by default. Desperate for swift cuts, governments have gone for slashing what they control directly, starting with public-sector pay and government running costs (including, in France, the presidential hunt).
The quest for growth is focusing minds on the most stubborn structural problems. In Belgium members of the government admit it is disastrous that just 35% of citizens between 55 and 64 still work (in Sweden, the proportion is twice as high). In Germany senior figures point to the barriers, such as patchy child care, that keep too many women out of the workforce. Fixing this, they suggest, could do more for domestic demand than deficit spending ever would. Even the old debate about whether Europe needs an industrial policy has been rendered less relevant, as governments lack the cash for picking winners. The shadow of corporatism
Yet all these elements do not have to lead to a happy ending for Europe. Today's austerity policies are risky, and may well swell jobless lines in the short and medium term. Politicians fear high unemployment, which can cow the toughest governments.
At the human level, complex interests may undermine reform. Take Spain's lost generation of unemployed youths. Many of them live with their parents, notes a Spanish economist. In broad economic terms their father's job for life makes papa an insider, damaging the interests of his ""outsider"" children. But papa also keeps the household afloat: his children have a keen interest in labour laws that keep their parent unsackable.
Public-sector workers, in particular, may look like privileged insiders. But cuts will make many feel like victims. European state workers are often badly paid, having consciously accepted low salaries and tedium in exchange for job security.
Leading officials in Brussels say they have to convince voters that Europe's model of open borders is in the interests of the ordinary citizen. The EU must craft regulation that is seen as stopping abuses, especially in the financial sector, or ""we will see the rise of protectionism and populism,"" says a senior Brussels official. Talk of giving Europe a ""social economy"" from people like Michel Barnier, a Frenchman and EU internal market commissioner, means something like making capitalism cuddlier: Mr Barnier is, for example, very keen on small local businesses.
The dangers are twofold. First, Mr Barnier and his colleagues are under pressure to propose swathes of crowd-pleasing regulation, especially in financial services. Second, cuddly capitalism has a habit of turning into crony capitalism. Europe has shed socialism as a ruling ideology, with even left-wing governments accepting they have to work with markets. Corporatism, an old European menace (think Mussolini), is a much bigger threat.
In Brussels competition regulators face intense lobbying from businessmen, industrialists and many governments demanding that aid and merger rules be eased, to help European champions withstand global competition. Such lobbying exposes a deep dispute about what the modern-day EU is for.
The EU was once a cosy club of western European countries. Now 27-strong, stretching from the Baltic to Cyprus and taking in ten ex-communist countries, the union's best justification may be as a means of managing globalisation.
For free-market liberals, the enlarged union's size and diversity is itself an advantage. By taking in eastern countries with lower labour costs and workers who are far more mobile than their western cousins, the EU in effect brought globalisation within its own borders. For economic liberals, that flexibility and dynamism offers Europe's best chance of survival.
But, for another other camp, involving Europe's left (and more or less the entire French political class), the point of Europe is to keep globalisation at bay, or at least curb its power. According to this thinking, single nations are too small to maintain high-cost social-welfare models in the face of global competition. But the EU, with its 500m people, is big enough to assert the supremacy of political will over market forces. For such politicians, European diversity is a problem because it undermines the most advanced (meaning expensive) social models. Such competition must be curbed with restrictions on labour migration from eastern Europe, subsidies for rich-country production and lots of harmonisation--including that old dream of the left, a European minimum wage.
Even in a negative scenario, such voices would struggle to win all their arguments: enlargement has given the newcomers a big say, and they are not about to harmonise away all their advantages. In private even French politicians know they need cheaper eastern manufacturing, too. But if growth does not return reasonably soon, the voices against free markets will grow ever louder. A Franco-German compromise?
What, then, of the policy solutions being proposed by EU leaders? Although France and Germany do not agree on the vital issue of euro-zone governance, it would be wrong to assume they will continue to disagree for ever. Eventually they will have to find a compromise; though, alas, few of their clashing solutions currently make sense.
Germany's push for strict discipline is essentially for public consumption. In private, senior EU officials admit that talk of sanctions is nonsense. France and Germany will never accept being fined or denied a vote, says one flatly. Fragile democracies in the east would react horribly to losing their voting rights, undermining all the EU's hard work to make them more democratic. Freezing funding for EU mega-projects is equally unworkable; such projects often cross borders, so punishing one country leaves others to suffer too.
As for the French-led camp pushing for redistribution to save the euro, whether through bail-outs, common Eurobonds or a ""fiscal transfer union"", it has an equally fundamental problem: how to square such integration with Europe's democratic deficit. Redistribution would require a giant leap towards political union. There is no appetite for such a union just now. 
How, then, will Europe try to save its single currency? By muddling through, is the best guess. There will be bail-outs that are not called bail-outs, ""temporary"" rescue funds for weak euro-zone members that prove very hard to cancel, and semi-formal discussions among member governments about their budgetary plans.
Will that be enough? That mostly depends on economic growth, and whether Europe draws the right lessons from this crisis. An open, flexible, competitive EU offers Europeans the best chance of confronting globalisation. But that is not the only EU on offer: a corporatist, cosy, populist union sounds very plausible to Europe's ageing, anxious voters. Big choices loom.",230,Spain,"As the euro-zone crisis spooks governments, opinions are diverging dramatically about what the union is for
WILL the European Union make it? The question would have sounded outlandish not long ago. Now even the project's greatest cheerleaders talk of a continent facing a ""Bermuda triangle"" of debt, demographic decline and lower growth.
As well as those chronic problems, the EU faces an acute crisis in its economic core, the 16 countries that use the single currency. Markets have lost faith that the euro zone's economies, weaker or stronger, will one day converge thanks to the discipline of sharing a single currency, which denies uncompetitive stragglers the quick fix of devaluation.
Yet the debate about how to save Europe's single currency from disintegration is stuck. It is stuck because the euro zone's dominant powers, France and Germany, agree on the need for greater harmonisation within the euro zone, but disagree about what to harmonise. 
Germany thinks the euro must be saved by stricter rules on borrowing, spending and competitiveness, backed by quasi-automatic sanctions for governments that stray. These might include threats to freeze EU funds for poorer regions and EU mega-projects, and even the suspension of a country's voting rights in EU ministerial councils. It insists that economic co-ordination should involve all 27 members of the EU club, among whom there is a small majority for free-market liberalism and economic rigour; in the inner core alone, Germany fears, a small majority favour French dirigisme.
A ""southern"" camp headed by France wants something different: ""European economic government"" within an inner core of euro-zone members. Translated, that means politicians meddling in monetary policy and a system of redistribution from richer to poorer members, via cheaper borrowing for governments through common Eurobonds or outright fiscal transfers. Finally, figures close to the French government have murmured, euro-zone members should agree to some fiscal and social harmonisation: eg, curbing competition in corporate-tax rates or labour costs. 
It is too soon to write off the EU. It remains the world's largest trading block. At its best, the European project is remarkably liberal: built around a single market of 27 rich and poor countries, its internal borders are far more porous to goods, capital and labour than any comparable trading area. It is an ambitious attempt to blunt the sharpest edges of globalisation, and make capitalism benign.
The problem is that the ""European social model"" has become, too often, a synonym for a very expensive way of doing things. It has also become an end in itself, with some EU leaders calling for Europe to grow purely in order to maintain its social-welfare systems. That is a pretty depressing call to arms: become more dynamic so Europe can still afford old-age pensions and unemployment benefits. 
Europe is in desperate need of good ideas and leadership. Too many EU leaders have tried to secure voter consent for bailing out weak links like Greece by murmuring darkly about ""Anglo-Saxon"" conspiracies to destroy the euro, and presenting bail-out mechanisms as a way to impose the will of the state over ""speculators"". Imaginary enemies are a desperate ruse to provide the union with coherence. The meltdown that wasn't
Two scenarios can be plausibly sketched out for Europe in the near term: one surprisingly positive, the other more negative. A positive scenario starts with the fact that things could be much worse. Think back 18 months or so, to a grim period marked by violent anti-government protests in Greece, Latvia, Bulgaria and Lithuania. The head of the Spanish confederation of employers' organisations, CEOE, could be heard suggesting it might be time for the free-market economy to take a ""time out"", to allow for government intervention. Politicians in Spain and Britain pressed bailed-out banks to lend first to domestic businesses and consumers. Greek authorities urged local banks to be ""prudent"" about transferring capital to Balkan subsidiaries. 
A senior official later identified an EU summit in December 2008 as the moment of maximum danger for the free-market cause. At a leaders' dinner Nicolas Sarkozy, France's president, berated the European Commission for applying EU rules too rigidly. All around him, heads nodded. If a show of hands had been called, the senior figure felt, an ""overwhelming majority"" of EU leaders would have voted to suspend the union's internal-market rules.
In France spooked aides to Mr Sarkozy said a ""European May 1968"" was brewing. Their boss suggested that billions of euros in aid for the French car industry should be linked to keeping production in France. It was, Mr Sarkozy explained, ""not justified"" for French firms to make cars for French drivers in Slovak factories. Alarmed at signs of growing east-west division, the Polish prime minister, Donald Tusk, declared that the European ship was ""rocking"", and ""they're going to start throwing the weaker passengers overboard.""
Mr Sarkozy's protectionism was mostly virtual, it turned out. French car firms continue to design thrifty little cars at home, while building them in lower-cost Slovenia, Romania or the Czech Republic. And the feared waves of civil unrest never came. From Greece to Spain or Ireland, protests and strikes have--to date--been smaller than expected, and dominated by public-sector workers with unusually safe jobs to protect.
In October 2009 the European Commission intervened after Germany was caught offering aid to sweeten the sale of Opel, a struggling carmaker, to a consortium pledging to keep open all four Opel factories in Germany (at the expense of more efficient plants elsewhere). The sale later fell through. On the one hand, it was worrying that Germany tried. On the other, it was a striking display of the power of the EU single market: the German government was told it could not spend taxpayers' money to keep jobs in Germany, without offering equal support to Opel factories in Spain, Belgium, Hungary or Britain.
The single currency was always supposed to drive structural reforms, as once-profligate countries were forced by the rules, and their peers, to live within their means. Instead, France and Germany led a rebellion against the disciplines of the ""stability and growth pact"" on the first occasion it looked about to catch them. That signalled a free-for-all. Less competitive members of the euro zone, notably in the ""Club Med"" countries, stood idly by as easy credit fuelled debt and asset bubbles, all the while allowing wages to soar. With some mortgage rates turning negative in real terms, it all felt like free money.
But northerners are also guilty of hypocrisy: it was German and French banks that led the way in lending to Greece or Spain. Lenders assumed that euro-zone sovereign debt was all rock-solid. For those pocketing the extra yields on southern bonds, that too felt like free money. In the words of one senior German, the root cause of the sovereign credit crisis in the euro zone was that markets at last ""realised that giving credit to Greece is riskier than giving credit to Austria.""
Northern governments also blocked early attempts at peer pressure. EU leaders, it is said, knew Greece was lying about its deficit figures back in 2008. Yet attempts to confront the then Greek prime minister, Costas Karamanlis, a conservative, came to nothing. Mr Karamanlis was shielded by fellow centre-right leaders, including some of those who now shout loudest for budgetary discipline.
Lessons do seem to have been learned. German officials say there is now bitter regret in Berlin that their country helped wreck the original stability and growth pact. But wrecked it was. Doing the right thing
European governments have nagged each other to carry out structural reforms for years, without great success. As Jean-Claude Juncker, prime minister of Luxembourg, said memorably in 2007: ""We all know what to do, but we don't know how to get re-elected once we have done it.""
Now, with markets shunning some Euro-laggards, doing the right thing is a matter of survival. Long-stuck dossiers are finally moving. On July 1st the European Commission announced plans to ram through an EU-wide patent valid in all 27 countries (a key demand of European business), after years of delays by Spain and Italy over the status given to their languages.
Earlier this year, EU leaders like Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero of Spain said flatly that market pressure on Spanish debt was a conspiracy. ""There is an attack under way by speculators against the euro, against tougher financial regulation of the financial system and of the markets,"" he claimed. But with market pressures reaching crisis point in May, Mr Zapatero reversed course, announcing civil-service pay cuts and other austerity measures. He unveiled a (modest) plan to ease Spain's rigid labour laws, which make older workers almost unsackable, leaving young and immigrant workers on temporary contracts to take the pain when Spain's property-led boom turned to bust. At 40%, youth unemployment in Spain is not just high; it is a moral indictment of an entire system.
At an EU summit in June, Mr Zapatero led calls for the publication of stress tests on European banks, a long-overdue measure being resisted by some in Germany. While still grumbling about unfounded rumours in financial markets (and he has a point), a more realistic Mr Zapatero argued: ""There is nothing better than transparency to demonstrate solvency.""
Crucially for those who believe in a happy ending to this crisis, voters seem made of sterner stuff than politicians feared, and can also see the need for structural reforms. Between 2005 and 2030 the working-age population of the European Union will shrink by 20m, and the number of those over 65 will increase by 40m. Thanks to the focus on crumbling public finances, that demographic time-bomb is now a common part of European public debate. Governments in places like Britain or the Netherlands have been able to propose paying pensions at 67 or even 70, without angry protests.
Even in France, where most voters told an opinion poll in June they considered a proposal to increase the retirement age to 62 ""unjust"", few dispute the idea that the current state-pension system faces insolvency. The left and right merely disagree about who should pay to fix this. In Greece, the most disruptive strikes have been staged by hardline Communist trade unions, with larger unions showing some restraint. The press, meanwhile, is filled with commentaries about how the country must live within its means, and how much things must change.
Some of Europe's most stubborn structural problems involve the misallocation of public spending. Governments have spent years padding civil-service payrolls, unveiling benefits like baby bonuses or early-retirement payments just before elections, and shovelling subsidies to politically powerful interest-groups.
Optimists have grounds for hoping that a squeeze on public spending will bring about some structural reforms by default. Desperate for swift cuts, governments have gone for slashing what they control directly, starting with public-sector pay and government running costs (including, in France, the presidential hunt).
The quest for growth is focusing minds on the most stubborn structural problems. In Belgium members of the government admit it is disastrous that just 35% of citizens between 55 and 64 still work (in Sweden, the proportion is twice as high). In Germany senior figures point to the barriers, such as patchy child care, that keep too many women out of the workforce. Fixing this, they suggest, could do more for domestic demand than deficit spending ever would. Even the old debate about whether Europe needs an industrial policy has been rendered less relevant, as governments lack the cash for picking winners. The shadow of corporatism
Yet all these elements do not have to lead to a happy ending for Europe. Today's austerity policies are risky, and may well swell jobless lines in the short and medium term. Politicians fear high unemployment, which can cow the toughest governments.
At the human level, complex interests may undermine reform. Take Spain's lost generation of unemployed youths. Many of them live with their parents, notes a Spanish economist. In broad economic terms their father's job for life makes papa an insider, damaging the interests of his ""outsider"" children. But papa also keeps the household afloat: his children have a keen interest in labour laws that keep their parent unsackable.
Public-sector workers, in particular, may look like privileged insiders. But cuts will make many feel like victims. European state workers are often badly paid, having consciously accepted low salaries and tedium in exchange for job security.
Leading officials in Brussels say they have to convince voters that Europe's model of open borders is in the interests of the ordinary citizen. The EU must craft regulation that is seen as stopping abuses, especially in the financial sector, or ""we will see the rise of protectionism and populism,"" says a senior Brussels official. Talk of giving Europe a ""social economy"" from people like Michel Barnier, a Frenchman and EU internal market commissioner, means something like making capitalism cuddlier: Mr Barnier is, for example, very keen on small local businesses.
The dangers are twofold. First, Mr Barnier and his colleagues are under pressure to propose swathes of crowd-pleasing regulation, especially in financial services. Second, cuddly capitalism has a habit of turning into crony capitalism. Europe has shed socialism as a ruling ideology, with even left-wing governments accepting they have to work with markets. Corporatism, an old European menace (think Mussolini), is a much bigger threat.
In Brussels competition regulators face intense lobbying from businessmen, industrialists and many governments demanding that aid and merger rules be eased, to help European champions withstand global competition. Such lobbying exposes a deep dispute about what the modern-day EU is for.
The EU was once a cosy club of western European countries. Now 27-strong, stretching from the Baltic to Cyprus and taking in ten ex-communist countries, the union's best justification may be as a means of managing globalisation.
For free-market liberals, the enlarged union's size and diversity is itself an advantage. By taking in eastern countries with lower labour costs and workers who are far more mobile than their western cousins, the EU in effect brought globalisation within its own borders. For economic liberals, that flexibility and dynamism offers Europe's best chance of survival.
But, for another other camp, involving Europe's left (and more or less the entire French political class), the point of Europe is to keep globalisation at bay, or at least curb its power. According to this thinking, single nations are too small to maintain high-cost social-welfare models in the face of global competition. But the EU, with its 500m people, is big enough to assert the supremacy of political will over market forces. For such politicians, European diversity is a problem because it undermines the most advanced (meaning expensive) social models. Such competition must be curbed with restrictions on labour migration from eastern Europe, subsidies for rich-country production and lots of harmonisation--including that old dream of the left, a European minimum wage.
Even in a negative scenario, such voices would struggle to win all their arguments: enlargement has given the newcomers a big say, and they are not about to harmonise away all their advantages. In private even French politicians know they need cheaper eastern manufacturing, too. But if growth does not return reasonably soon, the voices against free markets will grow ever louder. A Franco-German compromise?
What, then, of the policy solutions being proposed by EU leaders? Although France and Germany do not agree on the vital issue of euro-zone governance, it would be wrong to assume they will continue to disagree for ever. Eventually they will have to find a compromise; though, alas, few of their clashing solutions currently make sense.
Germany's push for strict discipline is essentially for public consumption. In private, senior EU officials admit that talk of sanctions is nonsense. France and Germany will never accept being fined or denied a vote, says one flatly. Fragile democracies in the east would react horribly to losing their voting rights, undermining all the EU's hard work to make them more democratic. Freezing funding for EU mega-projects is equally unworkable; such projects often cross borders, so punishing one country leaves others to suffer too.
As for the French-led camp pushing for redistribution to save the euro, whether through bail-outs, common Eurobonds or a ""fiscal transfer union"", it has an equally fundamental problem: how to square such integration with Europe's democratic deficit. Redistribution would require a giant leap towards political union. There is no appetite for such a union just now. 
How, then, will Europe try to save its single currency? By muddling through, is the best guess. There will be bail-outs that are not called bail-outs, ""temporary"" rescue funds for weak euro-zone members that prove very hard to cancel, and semi-formal discussions among member governments about their budgetary plans.

HE WAS once considered a political magician, with a sleight of hand that distracted from his country's problems. But now the circus skill needed by Spain's Socialist prime minister, Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero, is that of a tightrope walker.
Summer holidays, Spain's World Cup victory and positive-ish bank stress-test results have granted a lull in the storm that engulfed the country when bond markets turned their gaze from Greece to Iberia. But now Mr Zapatero must pull off a delicate balancing act if he is to stay in power until his second term formally ends in 2012. For the economy to survive, he must please the investors that lend Spain money. And for the government to survive, he must satisfy the Catalan and Basque nationalists who prop up his minority administration.
One false step and Spain risks falling back into the pit of uncertainty, with the most probable outcome early elections in spring. Mr Zapatero's career, already damaged by his sluggish reaction to the economic woes that have pushed Spain's unemployment rate up to almost 20%, would also crash. His Socialist Party already trails Mariano Rajoy's conservative opposition People's Party (PP) by 10% in the polls. 
The first wobble for Mr Zapatero comes with the autumn budget debate. The arithmetic of Spain's parliament, where the Socialists are seven seats short of a majority, and the decision of fairweather allies in left-wing and Catalan nationalist parties to withhold support, leaves the prime minister at the mercy of the six deputies of the Basque Nationalist Party (PNV).
Aware of its power, the PNV is playing tough. It has helped pass Mr Zapatero's previous budgets, usually in return for regional investment. But as he is seeing through an austerity package that wipes out EUR 15 billion of spending in two years, Mr Zapatero is hardly in a position to dish out pork. The PNV's other demands, for more autonomy, may be even harder to meet. ""We are ready to take part in political agreements as long as these involve full self-government,"" says Josu Erkoreka, the PNV's parliamentary leader.
This is not a call for independence, but for a range of incremental measures, varying from a right to field Basque sporting teams (at a time when most Spaniards would not look kindly upon the dismemberment of their beloved La Roja world champions) to powers over workforce training and referendums in two tiny enclaves the PNV claims should be Basque. Negotiations will be fraught.
The next wobble could come in October or November, when Catalans vote in regional elections (see box on next page). The nationalist Convergence and Union (CiU) coalition is set to oust a Socialist-led coalition from power. That will call for adjustments to the political balance elsewhere, especially in Madrid.
CiU's core supporters, anchored in small, family-owned businesses, are suffering as Mr Zapatero tussles with a budget deficit worth 11.2% of GDP and continuing slow growth. Mr Rajoy wants CiU, which is critical of Mr Zapatero's lukewarm reforms, to help him oust the government. But Mr Zapatero needs CiU's votes to pass his measures. Once the regional elections are out of the way, therefore, it will have a chance to play the two off against each other and push for further pension, labour and banking reforms. If Mr Zapatero will not go far enough, it knows that Mr Rajoy will.
There are signs that the Spanish prime minister has had a change of heart. In a revealing interview with El Pais on July 25th, Mr Zapatero admitted that the markets had taught him a lesson. He said that on May 9th he had a sleepless night waiting for the Nikkei to open as Europe's finance ministers put together a deal to stave off a continent-wide sovereign-debt crisis; not the sort of comment one expects from a Socialist. He also pledged to adopt further reform measures if necessary. But no proposals are likely until after a general strike, on September 29th, called by Spain's two largest trade unions, who are unhappy with Mr Zapatero's new-found appetite for reform.
Like its Basque counterpart, however, CiU is likely to be tempted as much by a greater ration of self-government than by another tranche of economic reform. Over 425,000 people joined a rally in Barcelona on July 10th to protest against a constitutional-court decision to strike down some parts of the region's 2006 autonomy charter and limit others. An unstable Zapatero government offers opportunities that the centralising PP would not. And political instability suits the Catalans: in the past they have got more when Madrid has had a minority government, says Salvador Giner, head of the Catalan Studies Institute.
But if the reform programme stalls and Spain flops back into recession, Catalan and Basque nationalists may abandon Mr Zapatero, making a 2011 election--and a PP government--likely. It is still unclear, however, what a government run by Mr Rajoy would do. The PP leader promises reform, but avoids going into detail. The glee with which his party recently announced it had stopped a rise in electricity charges has caused alarm. They are interventionists, says one glum energy sector executive.
Spaniards have grown used to Mr Zapatero's showmanship. The first six months of this year, when Spain held the rotating presidency of the European Union, was supposed to be the moment when the prime minister could enjoy the limelight. He did not. If Mr Zapatero fails to pull off his balancing act this time, he may not get another chance.",230,Spain,"Nationalists to the left of him, markets to the right, Spain's prime minister is in a tricky spot
HE WAS once considered a political magician, with a sleight of hand that distracted from his country's problems. But now the circus skill needed by Spain's Socialist prime minister, Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero, is that of a tightrope walker.
Summer holidays, Spain's World Cup victory and positive-ish bank stress-test results have granted a lull in the storm that engulfed the country when bond markets turned their gaze from Greece to Iberia. But now Mr Zapatero must pull off a delicate balancing act if he is to stay in power until his second term formally ends in 2012. For the economy to survive, he must please the investors that lend Spain money. And for the government to survive, he must satisfy the Catalan and Basque nationalists who prop up his minority administration.
One false step and Spain risks falling back into the pit of uncertainty, with the most probable outcome early elections in spring. Mr Zapatero's career, already damaged by his sluggish reaction to the economic woes that have pushed Spain's unemployment rate up to almost 20%, would also crash. His Socialist Party already trails Mariano Rajoy's conservative opposition People's Party (PP) by 10% in the polls. 
The first wobble for Mr Zapatero comes with the autumn budget debate. The arithmetic of Spain's parliament, where the Socialists are seven seats short of a majority, and the decision of fairweather allies in left-wing and Catalan nationalist parties to withhold support, leaves the prime minister at the mercy of the six deputies of the Basque Nationalist Party (PNV).
Aware of its power, the PNV is playing tough. It has helped pass Mr Zapatero's previous budgets, usually in return for regional investment. But as he is seeing through an austerity package that wipes out EUR 15 billion of spending in two years, Mr Zapatero is hardly in a position to dish out pork. The PNV's other demands, for more autonomy, may be even harder to meet. ""We are ready to take part in political agreements as long as these involve full self-government,"" says Josu Erkoreka, the PNV's parliamentary leader.
This is not a call for independence, but for a range of incremental measures, varying from a right to field Basque sporting teams (at a time when most Spaniards would not look kindly upon the dismemberment of their beloved La Roja world champions) to powers over workforce training and referendums in two tiny enclaves the PNV claims should be Basque. Negotiations will be fraught.
The next wobble could come in October or November, when Catalans vote in regional elections (see box on next page). The nationalist Convergence and Union (CiU) coalition is set to oust a Socialist-led coalition from power. That will call for adjustments to the political balance elsewhere, especially in Madrid.
CiU's core supporters, anchored in small, family-owned businesses, are suffering as Mr Zapatero tussles with a budget deficit worth 11.2% of GDP and continuing slow growth. Mr Rajoy wants CiU, which is critical of Mr Zapatero's lukewarm reforms, to help him oust the government. But Mr Zapatero needs CiU's votes to pass his measures. Once the regional elections are out of the way, therefore, it will have a chance to play the two off against each other and push for further pension, labour and banking reforms. If Mr Zapatero will not go far enough, it knows that Mr Rajoy will.
There are signs that the Spanish prime minister has had a change of heart. In a revealing interview with El Pais on July 25th, Mr Zapatero admitted that the markets had taught him a lesson. He said that on May 9th he had a sleepless night waiting for the Nikkei to open as Europe's finance ministers put together a deal to stave off a continent-wide sovereign-debt crisis; not the sort of comment one expects from a Socialist. He also pledged to adopt further reform measures if necessary. But no proposals are likely until after a general strike, on September 29th, called by Spain's two largest trade unions, who are unhappy with Mr Zapatero's new-found appetite for reform.
Like its Basque counterpart, however, CiU is likely to be tempted as much by a greater ration of self-government than by another tranche of economic reform. Over 425,000 people joined a rally in Barcelona on July 10th to protest against a constitutional-court decision to strike down some parts of the region's 2006 autonomy charter and limit others. An unstable Zapatero government offers opportunities that the centralising PP would not. And political instability suits the Catalans: in the past they have got more when Madrid has had a minority government, says Salvador Giner, head of the Catalan Studies Institute.
But if the reform programme stalls and Spain flops back into recession, Catalan and Basque nationalists may abandon Mr Zapatero, making a 2011 election--and a PP government--likely. It is still unclear, however, what a government run by Mr Rajoy would do. The PP leader promises reform, but avoids going into detail. The glee with which his party recently announced it had stopped a rise in electricity charges has caused alarm. They are interventionists, says one glum energy sector executive.
Spaniards have grown used to Mr Zapatero's showmanship. The first six months of this year, when Spain held the rotating presidency of the European Union, was supposed to be the moment when the prime minister could enjoy the limelight. He did not.

IT IS a brave act of defiance. It is also a sign that Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero, Spain's prime minister, is losing the iron grip he once held on his Socialist Party. A row has erupted over Mr Zapatero's attempt to impose a candidate to lead the party into elections for the Madrid region's parliament next May. 
Mr Zapatero's candidate for the post, one of Spain's 17 powerful regional premierships, is Trinidad Jimenez (pictured on next page), Spain's health minister. She is opposed by Tomas Gomez, the pugnacious leader of the Socialists' Madrid branch, who wants to stand himself. Rather than bow to his boss's demands, as expected, Mr Gomez has forced a party vote, which will be held in October. 
Party squabbling ahead of the vote has already begun, much to the glee of the opposition People's Party (PP). The PP's candidate, Esperanza Aguirre, a party favourite who has run Madrid since 2003, would probably have stormed to victory anyway, so the Socialist dust-up comes as a bonus.
All this would seem no more than a silly-season spat were a larger question not hanging in the air: will Mr Zapatero stand at the next general election? That is due no later than 2012, although the fragility of the prime minister's minority government may force him to bring the date forward.
Rumours abound. Some say Mr Zapatero knows that his unpopular economic reforms, including austerity measures to reduce Spain's budget deficit, have made him a toxic figure, and that he will be obliged to fall on his sword before the election. Others say his wife, Sonsoles Espinosa, is tired of life in the official Moncloa Palace residence, where the first couple have lived since Mr Zapatero took office in 2004. Whatever the truth, Spaniards appear to have tired of their prime minister. A recent poll found that only a third of Socialist voters want him to run again. 
Mr Zapatero chose Ms Jimenez over Mr Gomez because she does much better in personal polling--but that might lead some to ask why similar logic should not apply on the national stage. Among the members of the government that Spaniards say they find more enticing than the prime minister are Alfredo Perez Rubalcaba, the interior minister, and Carme Chacon, the defence minister. Jose Blanco, who has the transport portfolio and is Mr Zapatero's number two in the party hierarchy, is a rising star but may take the rap if Ms Jimenez goes down in flames. 
For the moment, however, there is no public jostling for position, not least because the Socialists' standing is so low; they trail the PP by ten points in polls. Few politicians seek to lead their party to defeat. And don't count the prime minister out just yet; one Zapatero ally describes the prime minister as ""a top-class political athlete,"" ready for anything.
Mr Zapatero's only consolation at the bottom of the polls is the company he keeps: Mariano Rajoy, leader of the PP, fares even worse by some counts. One view gaining ground is that victory at the next election will go to whichever party is brave enough to ditch its leader. 
Mr Zapatero will be damaged if his own party publicly snubs him in October. But Mr Gomez, a little-known former mayor from a dormitory town near Madrid, will emerge fortified, whatever the result. Expect a bright future for the first politician from within Mr Zapatero's own party to stand up to him--particularly if, as seems likely, the prime minister limps out of office in two years' time.

IT WAS a strange way to declare a ceasefire. In a video sent to a British television station on September 5th, masked leaders of the violent Basque separatist group ETA not only proclaimed a truce but said they had halted attacks several months ago. Why wait so long to tell the world? 
The answer lies in a double squeeze that has left Europe's last big home-grown terrorist group gasping for air. On the one hand ETA is losing the armed struggle it began over 40 years ago. In recent years police forces across Europe have dealt it blow after blow, reducing its deadliness (see chart on next page). But ETA is also being squeezed by its grassroots backers at home--and that may prove more decisive.
Analysts agree that police work forced ETA to call a temporary halt to its operations earlier this year, with its four armed units reportedly going into sleeper mode. The biggest blows came in February, when Ibon Gogeaskoetxea became the fifth military commander to fall in two years. At the same time police frustrated ETA's attempts to shift the operational base for its attacks, which are mostly carried out on Spanish soil, from France to Portugal. 
If Eta had called a halt in order to regroup and fix its battered infrastructure, then it made sense to stay silent. Why then announce a retroactive truce? This is where its supporters come in. In February thousands of radical separatists backed a call from former leaders of the banned Batasuna party to renounce violence. For the first time it seemed that, rather than toe Eta's line, some Batasuna leaders were ready to strike out on their own and pull many supporters with them. Eta has been under pressure to respond ever since. 
Earlier this month Batasuna's leaders put the finishing touches to a more detailed peace plan. Their proposals included a permanent ceasefire verified by international observers following the Mitchell principles used to bring peace to Northern Ireland. They also want their party made legal again.
Julen Madariaga, who helped found Eta as a radical separatist group in 1958, says it has been gradually losing support for at least 15 years. Violence drove Basque voters away from pro-ETA parties even before they were banned from last year's regional elections. Their share of the vote fell from 18% in 1998 to 12% in 2005. The mishandling of ceasefires did further damage. Eta called off a 14-month truce in 1999, despite support from moderate nationalists. The end of their last ceasefire, in 2006, was especially ham-fisted. A day after Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero, the prime minister, declared his optimism about the peace process, a huge car-bomb at Madrid's Barajas airport killed two people.
That may help explain why the government in Madrid has been so sceptical about this week's announcement. ETA was merely using the pause to reorganise and could not be trusted, said Alfredo Perez Rubalcaba, the interior minister. The government says it will settle for nothing less than a permanent end to violence. 
But it seems likely that this week's announcement was meant for the ears not of Spanish politicians but for Basque radical separatists. By offering a ceasefire, but one that falls far short of that suggested by the rebel Batasuna leaders, Eta is trying to grab back control of the grassroots. If they fall into line, it may go no further than this week's vague declaration, and use Mr Zapatero's refusal to talk as an excuse for an eventual return to bombs and bullets. But if it loses control over the separatists, it may be forced to walk the path to peace. The future depends on who wins this battle for Basque hearts and minds.

RARELY can a general strike have been so placid. When Spain's unions called workers out on September 29th, the government all but laid down a red carpet for them. ""I respect the strike,"" said Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero, the Socialist prime minister, against whose austerity measures the unions were protesting. ""I will not be the one who criticises the unions."" Such gentle talk was heard less elsewhere, as governments confronted demonstrators across Europe, with unions turning the day into one of continent-wide protest.
Mr Zapatero had sweetened the pill by announcing a tax increase for the rich in 2011. In any case, his cherished unions were performing more out of duty than rage. But the protests and the tax rise are reminders of the underlying problem. As Spain attempts to distance itself from more troubled euro-zone countries like Portugal and Ireland, it has to rein in a budget deficit that last year stood at 11.1% of GDP.
The tax rise, aimed at Spaniards earning over EUR 120,000 ($163,000), will do little to help. Fewer than 200,000 people will be caught. Other better-off Spaniards already find ways to avoid paying. Mr Zapatero does not dare raise taxes for lower earners for fear of losing support for his beleaguered party. This is why all the talk is of austerity. The 2011 budget, unveiled on September 24th, aims to slash spending by 3%, on top of this year's cuts, partly by freezing civil-service pay and some pensions. The goal is to cut the deficit to 6%.
Mr Zapatero may not want to raise taxes but not all regional governments, which account for half of public spending, are as restrained. Reduced funding from the centre and a drastic fall in construction taxes and land sales have cut local-government income by an average of 15%. Town halls and regional governments are increasingly tapping taxpayers, creating an uneven tax map. Rates for high earners are up to five percentage points higher in Socialist-led Catalonia or Andalusia than in Madrid, run by the conservative People's Party. 
Spending cuts are also part of the mix. Yet so far, says Pedro Arahuetes, the mayor of Segovia, the axe has fallen mostly on investment and non-essential services. The summer fiestas celebrated across Spain were a little less magnificent this year. ""Instead of hiring ten bands, you hire seven,"" says Mr Arahuetes. 
Juan Bravo, Madrid's finance chief, predicts that the city's income will not return to 2007 levels until 2016. Refuse collection and street cleaning are being cut. But it is the companies that provide services to Madrid and other cities that are suffering most. ""Last year I paid bills in 60 days, now I am paying in six or seven months,"" says Mr Bravo. In the worst-hit municipalities, even town-hall workers are paid late. ""I just cannot pay the basic running costs,"" says Alejandro Sanchez, mayor of La Linea de la Concepcion, in the south-west. 
Most of the blame lies with mayors. Drunk with cash in the boom years, they binged on populist projects, building nursery schools and care homes, in some cases taking business away from private providers. Now the government has placed strict limits on their debt levels, which will mean many contractors go unpaid. 
Mr Zapatero's minority government will get its budget through parliament only thanks to support from the Basque Nationalist Party, which is being repaid with yet more devolved powers for the Basque regional government. But there is more to be done. The government has revised its unemployment forecast for 2011 up to 19.3%. Its growth forecast of 1.3% looks optimistic. On September 30th Moody's, a credit-rating agency, downgraded Spain's debt. Markets will be convinced by Mr Zapatero's belated conversion to reform only if he hits his deficit targets. More cuts, or higher taxes, may yet be needed. Strikes are the least of Mr Zapatero's worries.

CAN things get any worse for Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero, Spain's beleaguered prime minister? Probably not. Austerity measures, labour reform and strikes have taken their toll: opinion polls show support for his Socialist Party plummeting to 29%, while unemployment, at over 20%, remains twice the euro-zone average. Speculation is rife over who will succeed Mr Zapatero as party leader, and whether he will step down before or after the next general election, due in 2012.
Hoping to secure his survival for the next 18 months, on October 20th Mr Zapatero unveiled a cabinet reshuffle. Out went Miguel Angel Moratinos, the long-serving foreign minister, to be replaced by Trinidad Jimenez, the health minister and a favourite of Mr Zapatero's. Two ministries were scrapped entirely. Alfredo Perez Rubalcaba, the veteran interior minister, adds the jobs of deputy prime minister and government spokesman to his portfolio. 
A few days earlier Mr Zapatero had sealed a pact with the Basque Nationalist Party (PNV) to ensure the passage of his minority government's budget. Mr Zapatero's boosters said the deal would help keep the prime minister in his job until 2012. Inigo Urkullu, the PNV's leader, gave no guarantee, but said that Mr Zapatero should reach the finishing line. In return, his party has won further transfers of power and money to the already highly devolved Basque regional government.
The reshuffle and the pact will free the Socialists to focus on a number of electoral contests to come--and to decide whether Mr Zapatero is the man to lead them into battle. The prospect of a series of heavy losses in regional elections over the next eight months, starting with Catalonia on November 28th, has started to concentrate minds within the party.
In early October Mr Zapatero suffered his first big internal party defeat. In a primary election to choose a candidate to lead the Socialists into elections for the Madrid parliament next May, Tomas Gomez, the party's leader in the capital, beat Ms Jimenez. This led to calls for change. ""We are heading towards electoral disaster if we do not change tack,"" said Jose Maria Barreda, the Socialists' leader in the region of Castile La Mancha. Carme Chacon, the defence minister, chose this moment to state that Spain was ready for its first woman prime minister, sparking debate about whether she was pitching for the job.
The question now is not whether Mr Zapatero will go, but when. Will he lead the party to electoral defeat in 2012 and fall on his sword afterwards, or will he stand down just before, recognising that only a fresh Socialist leader can stop a severe drubbing by the conservative People's Party? The PP's lead in some polls has risen to 14 points, enough to give it an absolute majority in parliament. Mr Zapatero has said, privately, that he will make the decision next year, according to El Pais. 
Who might come next? Ms Chacon would certainly present a different face. A 39-year-old, she would represent both a new generation and a gender revolution. She made headlines on her first day in office by inspecting troops when seven months' pregnant. Other potential candidates include Mr Rubalcaba and Eduardo Madina, a 34-year-old rising star. 
Meanwhile, Spain continues its snail-paced recovery. Few people outside the government expect growth above 1% next year. The IMF predicts that unemployment will remain the highest in the euro zone for at least five years. The devastated housing market has further to fall, and 20% of mortgage-holders could find themselves in negative equity, according to Standard & Poor's, a credit-rating agency.
Spain's recovery, in other words, will at best be faintly apparent by the time voters reach the polling booths early in 2012. That will be a good time to sweep out the old and bring in the new.

In return, his party has won further transfers of power and money to the already highly devolved Basque regional government.
The reshuffle and the pact will free the Socialists to focus on a number of electoral contests to come--and to decide whether Mr Zapatero is the man to lead them into battle. The prospect of a series of heavy losses in regional elections over the next eight months, starting with Catalonia on November 28th, has started to concentrate minds within the party.
In early October Mr Zapatero suffered his first big internal party defeat. In a primary election to choose a candidate to lead the Socialists into elections for the Madrid parliament next May, Tomas Gomez, the party's leader in the capital, beat Ms Jimenez. This led to calls for change. ""We are heading towards electoral disaster if we do not change tack,"" said Jose Maria Barreda, the Socialists' leader in the region of Castile La Mancha. Carme Chacon, the defence minister, chose this moment to state that Spain was ready for its first woman prime minister, sparking debate about whether she was pitching for the job.
The question now is not whether Mr Zapatero will go, but when. Will he lead the party to electoral defeat in 2012 and fall on his sword afterwards, or will he stand down just before, recognising that only a fresh Socialist leader can stop a severe drubbing by the conservative People's Party? The PP's lead in some polls has risen to 14 points, enough to give it an absolute majority in parliament. Mr Zapatero has said, privately, that he will make the decision next year, according to El Pais. 
Who might come next? Ms Chacon would certainly present a different face. A 39-year-old, she would represent both a new generation and a gender revolution. She made headlines on her first day in office by inspecting troops when seven months' pregnant. Other potential candidates include Mr Rubalcaba and Eduardo Madina, a 34-year-old rising star. 
Meanwhile, Spain continues its snail-paced recovery. Few people outside the government expect growth above 1% next year. The IMF predicts that unemployment will remain the highest in the euro zone for at least five years. The devastated housing market has further to fall, and 20% of mortgage-holders could find themselves in negative equity, according to Standard & Poor's, a credit-rating agency.
Spain's recovery, in other words, will at best be faintly apparent by the time voters reach the polling booths early in 2012. That will be a good time to sweep out the old and bring in the new. But will anyone else want to lead Spain's Socialists into what looks like certain defeat?",True

Some investors think this may end up costing even more than the promised EU/IMF loans of some EUR 85 billion ($115 billion)--especially if bank deposits continue to flee the country (see Buttonwood,
). Ireland's failing government adds to the doubt, because it could find it hard to push through an austerity budget before a new election (
). In Greece the fear is that the government cannot raise enough in taxes or grow fast enough to finance its vast borrowing. Likewise in Portugal, which though less severely troubled than Greece nevertheless seems likely to follow Ireland to the bail-out window. 
If the panic were confined to these three, the euro zone could cope. But Europe's bail-out fund is not big enough to handle the country next in line: Spain, the euro's fourth-biggest economy, with a GDP bigger than Greece, Ireland and Portugal combined. 
On the face of it, the Spanish fears look exaggerated. Although it shares something of Ireland's banking woes and of Greece's wretched competitiveness, it is in less trouble than either. Its public debt, at around 60% of GDP, is below both Germany's and the EU average. Its big banks are strong. Its multinationals are increasing their exports. In May, when investors ditched Spanish assets during the Greek panic, Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero, Spain's prime minister, abandoned the notion of spending his way out of recession. Instead he ordered spending cuts and then tax rises to trim the budget deficit from 11% of GDP in 2009 to 6% next year. And, prodded by the Bank of Spain, the authorities are trying to force through mergers of cajas, the troubled savings banks that financed Spain's disastrous property bubble.
Then Mr Zapatero, who has shown no real understanding of the need for reform, made a big mistake.

ON NOVEMBER 21st the Irish government at last gave in. It yielded to pressure from its European Union counterparts to seek an emergency bail-out from the EU and the IMF that may amount to as much as EUR 85 billion ($115 billion). In May, when the Greek government secured a 110 billion bail-out and a joint EU/IMF fund worth a stonking EUR 750 billion was put in place, investors believed and the markets rallied. Not this time. Bond yields in Ireland dropped back to 7.93%, but rose to 4.75% in Spain and 11.75% in Greece. 
Why? In short, because rescues need a bit of ""shock and awe"" to convince investors. The bond markets must be startled by the size of the package, persuaded that the authorities will do whatever is needed--and not be invited to doubt it by talk of making investors foot part of the bill in future. They also have to believe that a country's difficulties concern liquidity (ie, they can repay debt eventually) not solvency (ie, they can't). 
In this case the markets felt starved of detail, and bothered by German insistence that private investors must bear part of the burden. They worried whether Ireland, having looked dodgy for so long, could cope with this politically, could ever regain investors' trust, and would ever be able to repay its debts. And, not least, they agonised about where in the euro zone contagion might spread to next.
The lack of clarity is especially crucial. Shares in the big Irish banks fell because investors feared they would suffer as more public capital was injected. Talk of nationalising Bank of Ireland, one of the few big Irish banks that is not already largely in state ownership, was hardly reassuring. Worse, the deal will not eliminate Ireland's debts, but simply refinance them. Nor is there any guarantee that depositors will not shift to safer places within the euro area. The reaction of the big credit-rating agencies was prompt and instructive. Standard & Poor's downgraded Irish government debt from AA- to A, and Moody's promised a ""multi-notch downgrade"".
The bail-out's failure was immediately apparent in the spreads of Irish, Portuguese and Spanish government debt over German bonds. Within 24 hours, these had grown wider than before the deal was announced (see chart 1 on the next page). Ominously, the spread on Spanish bonds reached its highest since the euro's launch in 1999. And on November 23rd Portugal was paying over four percentage points more than Germany to borrow money; Greece was paying a similar spread in mid-April, just weeks before its bail-out.
It was all eerily reminiscent of 2008, when desperate efforts to rescue and revive American and other banks produced only ephemeral rallies. ""With each successive bail-out, the appetite for further rescues becomes limited,"" comments Julian Jessop of Capital Economics. In March 2008 the rescue of Bear Stearns led to such an outcry that the American authorities were unwilling to save Lehman Brothers in September. The fear this time is that German voters, and their political leaders, will similarly lose patience. Trouble on the Liffey...
In Ireland the beleaguered prime minister, Brian Cowen, was left this week with a battle on two fronts: to keep his job and to pass the 2011 budget in early December. His credibility was already threadbare, not least because he was finance minister when the Irish bubble inflated to its fullest extent and then prime minister when it burst. Moreover, his government's decision to seek a bail-out came after repeated denials that any such help was either needed or had been asked for. 
This humiliating reversal cost Mr Cowen both public support and political backing. Among Irish voters, the arrival of so-called rescuers from Washington and Brussels has met with mixed emotions: in part stoical resignation, but also outrage at their country's mendicant condition and apparent loss of sovereignty. The Irish Times was moved to wonder if the sacrifice of Ireland's freedom fighters during the 1916 Easter rising had been in vain.
The political fallout was swift. The Green Party, a junior partner in the coalition led by Mr Cowen's Fianna Fail, declared on November 22nd that it would walk out in January, triggering an early election. The party was aggrieved by Mr Cowen's mishandling of the bail-out request and his failure to speak clearly to the public. The Greens have at least conceded that they may first help to pass the 2011 budget on December 7th to give effect to the government's four-year plan to cut the budget deficit to 3% of GDP by 2014, and thus comply with the terms of the EU/IMF rescue plan. But even that promise may not be enough to get the budget through.
Some Fianna Fail backbenchers were almost equally damning of Mr Cowen and called for him to resign. As in the past, he defied those critics and won a temporary reprieve for his leadership. But he is sure to face a more serious challenge in the new year, when Fianna Fail seems highly likely to lose the election to a Fine Gael/Labour coalition. In effect, a leadership contest within Fianna Fail has already begun. 
Until the election is held, Mr Cowen will head a caretaker government with an uncertain parliamentary position. His majority had already slipped since the 2007 election from 13 to only three. With Fianna Fail almost certain to lose a by-election in Donegal this week, probably to Sinn Fein, that may now shrink to two. Moreover, two independent backbenchers on whom the government has relied for its majority have said they may not vote for the budget. Unless some opposition members abstain, the budget may thus not get through. 
What makes the budget harder to swallow is that it is be a fiercely austere measure, including for 2011 EUR 6 billion in spending cuts and tax rises, savage welfare and public-sector pay cuts and a reduction in the minimum wage. This front-loads a four-year plan to make total savings of 15 billion and bring the budget deficit below 3% of GDP by 2014. The government is under huge pressure to pass such a budget. Olli Rehn, the European economic commissioner, this week insisted that Brussels would not interfere in Irish politics, but added grimly that ""stability is important"". The only consolation for the Irish is that, so far at least, they have managed to hang on to the principle that they can maintain their trademark low 12.5% corporate-tax rate.
In a last-ditch effort to get help from Fine Gael and Labour, Mr Cowen offered them access to the financial advice underpinning the budget. Yet both parties formally insist that an election should be held before the budget is adopted, not after. That might hasten the arrival of a Fine Gael/Labour coalition--though it will still have to make cuts similar to Mr Cowen's. It is possible that, in a bid to share the blame out in advance, the opposition parties may exercise voting discretion to ease the budget's passage in December. That is what Mr Cowen seems to be counting on. His party's poll rating (17%) is at its lowest ever. It seems that Fianna Fail, the dominant party in Ireland ever since the country's independence in the 1920s, is heading for the greatest electoral reversal in its history. ...on the Tagus...
If the markets are neither persuaded by the Irish bail-out nor reassured that Dublin will push through its budget, they seem almost as fretful about the Iberian countries. After Greece in May and Ireland this month, Portugal is clearly next in line. This week a general strike was called against budget austerity. Yet the Socialist-led government of Jose Socrates has no alternative. Portugal's banks may be healthier than Ireland's, but the country is mired in slow growth and a large budget deficit. In the markets' current mood, a bail-out similar to Ireland's seems almost inevitable.
The real concern now is not Portugal but Spain. The Spanish economy is much bigger than those of Greece, Ireland and Portugal combined. The government's financing requirement next year, though comparable as a share of GDP, similarly dwarfs those of Greece, Ireland and Portugal taken together (see chart 2). It is a Spanish mantra, requiring a mere change of name of euro-area countries, to insist that Spain is different. ""We're not Greece!"" has become ""We're not Ireland!"", and will shortly become ""We're not Portugal!"" 
In all three cases the Spanish are correct, though that is not always a comfort. To start with, a bail-out of Spain would be on a different scale. When the EUR 750 billion European Financial Stability Facility was designed in May, few people thought that it would be needed to cope with Spain as well as the other three weak euro-area countries. And there seemed little likelihood that it would have to.
What may help is that Spain has been a lot better behaved than the other three and so seems much less in need of a bail-out. A national debt of only 53% of GDP last year was a full 21 points below the EU average. Spain has neither Ireland's broken banks nor Greece's profligate public finances. Its austerity targets are more credible than Portugal's. 
But as a broken Ireland seeks help and a shaky Portugal puts Iberia in the spotlight (not least because Spanish banks are heavily exposed to Portugal), there are understandable fears that Spain will catch the bug next. ""Contagion has spreadto Greek debt, to Portuguese debt and, to a lesser degree, to our own debt as well as Italy's and even Belgium's,"" admitted the Bank of Spain's governor, Miguel Fernandez Ordonez, this week.
Until recently the risk of contagion had seemed small. Spain had successfully dislodged itself from the group of peripheral euro-area countries with the most punishing bond yields. The euro crisis in May forced an ostrich-like Socialist government under Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero to remove its head from the sand, bring in austerity measures to cut the budget deficit, which hit 11% of GDP last year, and even to pass a modest labour-market reform. Those measures seemed to be working. The central government's share of the budget deficit looks like being 2.7 points less in the first ten months of this year than in 2009, and the tax take is up by 10%. 
A recent deal with the Basque Nationalist Party has given Mr Zapatero's minority government the parliamentary clout to push through another austerity budget for 2011. Next year's deficit target is just 6% of GDP. The prime minister sounds steely in his resolve to hit it. He has cut civil-service pay by 5%, raised VAT and ridden out a general strike. He has pledged more measures if needed. 
So far, so good. But, just as Ireland had unique problems that made it different from Greece, and Portugal presents its own special difficulties, so Spain has its own peculiar set of troubles. It shares an Irish-style housing bust with the meagre growth prospects of Portugal and Greece. Unemployment is over 20%. As the contagion spreads and the markets remain nervous, the pressure is mounting for it to do more to distance itself from those stuck at the bottom of the euro class.
This is about a lot more than fiscal austerity. The change of course signalled by the government's modest labour-market reform in June will surely have to be taken further. But the markets' concern is that Mr Zapatero acts not from conviction, but only when he must. ""Every time international markets put some pressure on our debt, the Spanish government indicates it is going to do some reform,"" says Juan Rubio-Ramirez, a Spanish economist at Duke University. ""And as the pressure waters down, it relaxes.""
Thus pension reform, first flagged as long ago as January, has been postponed until the first quarter of next year. Discussions about the antiquated collective-bargaining mechanism are going agonisingly slowly. Serious reform of the health-care system, where much of the money sent from Madrid to regional governments is spent, is barely even being talked about. 
Another worry is that, although the big Spanish banks look strong and well-capitalised, the same cannot be said of the savings banks or cajas. Some 40 out of 45 cajas are involved in tortuous merger negotiations, aided by EUR 14.4 billion from Spain's Fund for Orderly Bank Restructuring (FROB) and a deposit guarantee fund. Frustrated by the slow pace, the Bank of Spain and the government have given them until year-end to complete their deals. 
One problem for the cajas is wholesale funding. Spanish lenders (unlike Irish banks) have sharply reduced their dependence on short-term financing from the European Central Bank, from a peak reached in July. Stronger banks and cajas have also been able to borrow from the wholesale markets, even if only at high rates and, in some cases, using state guarantees. But a number of cajas, representing as much as 12% of the financial system by assets, are shut out of the markets, according to Analistas Financieros Internacionales, a consultancy. It reckons the system as a whole needs to roll over some EUR 100 billion a year for the next two years. 
The market shutdown reflects uncertainty over the extent of restructuring needed for the cajas. Spain is overbanked and profitability is sinking quickly at these institutions, thanks to a higher cost of funding and shrinking credit. The worry is that FROB money is being used to close down branches and reduce staff, leaving less firepower to deal with more hidden losses from the banking system's staggering EUR 323 billion of exposure to property developers. Most bankers expect the cajas will have to go through another round of consolidation in the next few months, perhaps helped by more government money. The hope is that the FROB, which has a capacity of EUR 99 billion, will be big enough to deal with it. 
Both to reassure markets and to return to growth, Spain needs further structural reforms. ""We are doing what should be done, but not with the necessary energy or conviction,"" says Juan Jose Toribio of the IESE business school. Budget cuts may also eat into economic growth in the short term. Even Mr Zapatero has admitted that the recovery is slow and uncertain. He has recently added a new realism to his speeches. ""We cannot yet be sure that there is an irreversible change in the trend,"" he told a parliamentary debate on joblessness on November 18th. The OECD predicts that Spain's GDP will shrink slightly this year and grow by just 0.9% next year.
Mr Zapatero claims to have had a moment of market epiphany in May. In a recent interview with the editor of the newspaper El Pais, he denied that Spain had put the euro at risk by resisting change before then. The measures he took helped to convince investors that his country was not a potential default risk. But in today's nervous markets he will have to do more to prove his commitment. ...and across the Rhine
It is not only the bond markets that countries like Greece, Ireland, Portugal and Spain must satisfy. The most concerned onlooker is Germany, which sees its credit lying behind the entire euro area. As ever, Europe's biggest tabloid, Bild, captured the mood this week, asking ""First the Greeks, then the Irish, then...will we end up having to pay for everyone in Europe?""
Chancellor Angela Merkel and her finance minister, Wolfgang Schauble, are keenly aware of German voters' resentment of euro bail-outs. They are also uneasily conscious of the German constitutional court, which endorsed European economic and monetary union prescribed in the 1992 Maastricht treaty only on the basis of the treaty's no-bail-out provisions. For these reasons, Mrs Merkel and Mr Schauble are continuing to insist on two proposals. 
One is that the EU treaties must be amended to give permanent status to the European Financial Stability Facility. Without this, they say, the rescue fund will expire in 2013. But investors know from experience that treaty amendment is neither simple nor quick (it took years to push through the Lisbon treaty). Insistence on treaty change makes them nervous.
So, even more, does the second German demand: that future bail-outs must include debt-restructuring provisions to impose some losses (""haircuts"") on investors. This is an understandable, even desirable, idea--if investors never lost money on sovereign bonds, why bother to distinguish among countries according to their credit rating? But it was Mrs Merkel's vague public touting of the idea that set off the latest bout of nerves. If leaders cannot speak without unintentionally spreading alarm, they should not speak at all.
It might also help if European leaders stopped talking of the euro crisis in quite such apocalyptic terms. Recently the president of the European Council, Herman Van Rompuy, suggested that, if the euro did not survive, neither would the EU. This week Mrs Merkel said the euro was in an ""exceptionally serious"" situation. Mr Schauble added that ""our common currency is at stake."" That may be true, but it hardly inspires confidence.

Moreover, two independent backbenchers on whom the government has relied for its majority have said they may not vote for the budget. Unless some opposition members abstain, the budget may thus not get through. 
What makes the budget harder to swallow is that it is be a fiercely austere measure, including for 2011 EUR 6 billion in spending cuts and tax rises, savage welfare and public-sector pay cuts and a reduction in the minimum wage. This front-loads a four-year plan to make total savings of 15 billion and bring the budget deficit below 3% of GDP by 2014. The government is under huge pressure to pass such a budget. Olli Rehn, the European economic commissioner, this week insisted that Brussels would not interfere in Irish politics, but added grimly that ""stability is important"". The only consolation for the Irish is that, so far at least, they have managed to hang on to the principle that they can maintain their trademark low 12.5% corporate-tax rate.
In a last-ditch effort to get help from Fine Gael and Labour, Mr Cowen offered them access to the financial advice underpinning the budget. Yet both parties formally insist that an election should be held before the budget is adopted, not after. That might hasten the arrival of a Fine Gael/Labour coalition--though it will still have to make cuts similar to Mr Cowen's. It is possible that, in a bid to share the blame out in advance, the opposition parties may exercise voting discretion to ease the budget's passage in December. That is what Mr Cowen seems to be counting on. His party's poll rating (17%) is at its lowest ever. It seems that Fianna Fail, the dominant party in Ireland ever since the country's independence in the 1920s, is heading for the greatest electoral reversal in its history. ...on the Tagus...
If the markets are neither persuaded by the Irish bail-out nor reassured that Dublin will push through its budget, they seem almost as fretful about the Iberian countries. After Greece in May and Ireland this month, Portugal is clearly next in line. This week a general strike was called against budget austerity. Yet the Socialist-led government of Jose Socrates has no alternative. Portugal's banks may be healthier than Ireland's, but the country is mired in slow growth and a large budget deficit. In the markets' current mood, a bail-out similar to Ireland's seems almost inevitable.
The real concern now is not Portugal but Spain. The Spanish economy is much bigger than those of Greece, Ireland and Portugal combined. The government's financing requirement next year, though comparable as a share of GDP, similarly dwarfs those of Greece, Ireland and Portugal taken together (see chart 2). It is a Spanish mantra, requiring a mere change of name of euro-area countries, to insist that Spain is different. ""We're not Greece!"" has become ""We're not Ireland!"", and will shortly become ""We're not Portugal!"" 
In all three cases the Spanish are correct, though that is not always a comfort. To start with, a bail-out of Spain would be on a different scale. When the EUR 750 billion European Financial Stability Facility was designed in May, few people thought that it would be needed to cope with Spain as well as the other three weak euro-area countries. And there seemed little likelihood that it would have to.
What may help is that Spain has been a lot better behaved than the other three and so seems much less in need of a bail-out. A national debt of only 53% of GDP last year was a full 21 points below the EU average. Spain has neither Ireland's broken banks nor Greece's profligate public finances. Its austerity targets are more credible than Portugal's. 
But as a broken Ireland seeks help and a shaky Portugal puts Iberia in the spotlight (not least because Spanish banks are heavily exposed to Portugal), there are understandable fears that Spain will catch the bug next. ""Contagion has spreadto Greek debt, to Portuguese debt and, to a lesser degree, to our own debt as well as Italy's and even Belgium's,"" admitted the Bank of Spain's governor, Miguel Fernandez Ordonez, this week.
Until recently the risk of contagion had seemed small. Spain had successfully dislodged itself from the group of peripheral euro-area countries with the most punishing bond yields. The euro crisis in May forced an ostrich-like Socialist government under Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero to remove its head from the sand, bring in austerity measures to cut the budget deficit, which hit 11% of GDP last year, and even to pass a modest labour-market reform. Those measures seemed to be working. The central government's share of the budget deficit looks like being 2.7 points less in the first ten months of this year than in 2009, and the tax take is up by 10%. 
A recent deal with the Basque Nationalist Party has given Mr Zapatero's minority government the parliamentary clout to push through another austerity budget for 2011. Next year's deficit target is just 6% of GDP. The prime minister sounds steely in his resolve to hit it. He has cut civil-service pay by 5%, raised VAT and ridden out a general strike. He has pledged more measures if needed. 
So far, so good. But, just as Ireland had unique problems that made it different from Greece, and Portugal presents its own special difficulties, so Spain has its own peculiar set of troubles. It shares an Irish-style housing bust with the meagre growth prospects of Portugal and Greece. Unemployment is over 20%. As the contagion spreads and the markets remain nervous, the pressure is mounting for it to do more to distance itself from those stuck at the bottom of the euro class.
This is about a lot more than fiscal austerity. The change of course signalled by the government's modest labour-market reform in June will surely have to be taken further. But the markets' concern is that Mr Zapatero acts not from conviction, but only when he must. ""Every time international markets put some pressure on our debt, the Spanish government indicates it is going to do some reform,"" says Juan Rubio-Ramirez, a Spanish economist at Duke University. ""And as the pressure waters down, it relaxes.""
Thus pension reform, first flagged as long ago as January, has been postponed until the first quarter of next year. Discussions about the antiquated collective-bargaining mechanism are going agonisingly slowly. Serious reform of the health-care system, where much of the money sent from Madrid to regional governments is spent, is barely even being talked about. 
Another worry is that, although the big Spanish banks look strong and well-capitalised, the same cannot be said of the savings banks or cajas. Some 40 out of 45 cajas are involved in tortuous merger negotiations, aided by EUR 14.4 billion from Spain's Fund for Orderly Bank Restructuring (FROB) and a deposit guarantee fund. Frustrated by the slow pace, the Bank of Spain and the government have given them until year-end to complete their deals. 
One problem for the cajas is wholesale funding. Spanish lenders (unlike Irish banks) have sharply reduced their dependence on short-term financing from the European Central Bank, from a peak reached in July. Stronger banks and cajas have also been able to borrow from the wholesale markets, even if only at high rates and, in some cases, using state guarantees. But a number of cajas, representing as much as 12% of the financial system by assets, are shut out of the markets, according to Analistas Financieros Internacionales, a consultancy. It reckons the system as a whole needs to roll over some EUR 100 billion a year for the next two years. 
The market shutdown reflects uncertainty over the extent of restructuring needed for the cajas. Spain is overbanked and profitability is sinking quickly at these institutions, thanks to a higher cost of funding and shrinking credit. The worry is that FROB money is being used to close down branches and reduce staff, leaving less firepower to deal with more hidden losses from the banking system's staggering EUR 323 billion of exposure to property developers. Most bankers expect the cajas will have to go through another round of consolidation in the next few months, perhaps helped by more government money. The hope is that the FROB, which has a capacity of EUR 99 billion, will be big enough to deal with it. 
Both to reassure markets and to return to growth, Spain needs further structural reforms. ""We are doing what should be done, but not with the necessary energy or conviction,"" says Juan Jose Toribio of the IESE business school. Budget cuts may also eat into economic growth in the short term. Even Mr Zapatero has admitted that the recovery is slow and uncertain. He has recently added a new realism to his speeches. ""We cannot yet be sure that there is an irreversible change in the trend,"" he told a parliamentary debate on joblessness on November 18th. The OECD predicts that Spain's GDP will shrink slightly this year and grow by just 0.9% next year.
Mr Zapatero claims to have had a moment of market epiphany in May. In a recent interview with the editor of the newspaper El Pais, he denied that Spain had put the euro at risk by resisting change before then. The measures he took helped to convince investors that his country was not a potential default risk. But in today's nervous markets he will have to do more to prove his commitment. ...and across the Rhine
It is not only the bond markets that countries like Greece, Ireland, Portugal and Spain must satisfy. The most concerned onlooker is Germany, which sees its credit lying behind the entire euro area. As ever, Europe's biggest tabloid, Bild, captured the mood this week, asking ""First the Greeks, then the Irish, then...will we end up having to pay for everyone in Europe?""
Chancellor Angela Merkel and her finance minister, Wolfgang Schauble, are keenly aware of German voters' resentment of euro bail-outs. They are also uneasily conscious of the German constitutional court, which endorsed European economic and monetary union prescribed in the 1992 Maastricht treaty only on the basis of the treaty's no-bail-out provisions. For these reasons, Mrs Merkel and Mr Schauble are continuing to insist on two proposals. 
One is that the EU treaties must be amended to give permanent status to the European Financial Stability Facility. Without this, they say, the rescue fund will expire in 2013. But investors know from experience that treaty amendment is neither simple nor quick (it took years to push through the Lisbon treaty). Insistence on treaty change makes them nervous.
So, even more, does the second German demand: that future bail-outs must include debt-restructuring provisions to impose some losses (""haircuts"") on investors. This is an understandable, even desirable, idea--if investors never lost money on sovereign bonds, why bother to distinguish among countries according to their credit rating? But it was Mrs Merkel's vague public touting of the idea that set off the latest bout of nerves. If leaders cannot speak without unintentionally spreading alarm, they should not speak at all.
It might also help if European leaders stopped talking of the euro crisis in quite such apocalyptic terms. Recently the president of the European Council, Herman Van Rompuy, suggested that, if the euro did not survive, neither would the EU. This week Mrs Merkel said the euro was in an ""exceptionally serious"" situation. Mr Schauble added that ""our common currency is at stake."" That may be true, but it hardly inspires confidence.

IT HAS been another bad week for Spain's Socialist prime minister, Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero. Bond yields rose after Ireland's bail-out, triggering new promises of more privatisations and tax breaks for small business. These were also sops to the new kings of Catalonia, the pro-business Convergence and Union (CiU) nationalists, who routed the ruling Socialists in the election on November 28th.
The victory of the conservative CiU in one of Spain's richest and most populous regions, plus a rise in the vote for the opposition People's Party (PP), may signal a sea-change in Spanish politics. This was the first election since Mr Zapatero's May austerity measures, designed to fend off suggestions that Spain might be on the list of euro countries needing bail-outs. His party's share of the vote fell from 27% to only 18%. It seems sure to do badly in local and regional elections due next May. Mr Zapatero's exit at the next general election, due by April 2012, looks a racing certainty.
A second intriguing outcome is to increase the chances of a deal between the CiU and the PP. The CiU won 62 of the 135 seats in the Catalan parliament, six short of a majority. For the time being its leader, Artur Mas, will govern without allies. But his victory clears the way for a later deal that might see CiU deputies prop up a PP minority government in Madrid after 2012, in exchange for PP support in Barcelona. The chances of four years of stable conservative government in Spain after the next election have risen sharply.
On the campaign trail Mr Mas put the economy before demands for more tax-raising and other powers. Catalans voted with Spain's economic malaise (notably, 20% unemployment) in mind, says Jordi Sauret, a sociologist at Barcelona's Abat Oliba CEU university. Mr Mas promises austerity. With the Catalan government paying 7% on one-year bonds, he has little choice. He could show he is serious by suppressing many of the 200-plus quangos that sprouted like mushrooms under previous governments, suggests Joaquin Trigo of Foment del Treball, the Catalan employers' federation. 
But the election also suggests that Catalans want to run more of their own affairs. Mr Mas has a forthright attitude to wresting powers from Madrid without demanding full independence, making him a ""sovereigntist"" in the local jargon. That sets up a possible clash with the centralist-minded PP, although the party weakens on devolution when political expediency requires. At all events there is a clear majority of sovereigntists and separatists in the Catalan parliament. A ruling by Spain's constitutional court watering down an autonomy statute passed by Mr Zapatero has raised passions. At the time polls briefly showed support for independence rising to 50%, but that has slipped back. Only one in ten voters backed openly separatist parties on November 28th.
Spain's economic woes and Catalan nationalist aspirations are closely related. Catalans' age-old complaint that their taxes support less hard-working areas of Spain has become louder as they suffer at home. Mr Zapatero came to power pledging to reduce the historic tensions between Madrid and Barcelona. He may leave having done the opposite.

ONE measure of the decline of ETA, the Basque separatist terror group, is that even Basques no longer consider it much of a worry. The group's fall into long periods of inactivity, punctuated by fitful bursts of violence, has combined with economic fears, notably about Spain's runaway unemployment, to push it to the back of Basque minds.
That has not stopped speculation over what ETA plans to do next. Four months ago it declared a halt to ""offensive armed actions"". Spanish press reports claim the group will soon upgrade this ceasefire to become ""verifiable"" and ""permanent"". But its words are hard to trust. Florencio Dominguez, a Basque terrorism expert, points to the group's long history of broken promises and failed truces. 
Spain's Socialist prime minister, Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero, will not need reminding of this. Four years ago, believing ETA was serious about peace during a previous ceasefire, he publicly declared his optimism. A day later an ETA bomb at Madrid's Barajas airport killed two people and brought down a multi-storey car park. ""All we want from ETA is a definitive end to violence. A total and absolute end, forever,"" Mr Zapatero said in response to the latest rumours. 
The prime minister has new Basque friends to bolster him. Since October his minority administration in Madrid has been propped up by the six deputies of the Basque Nationalist Party (PNV), who provide their support in return for various goodies from the government. Relations between Mr Zapatero and Inigo Urkullu, the PNV leader, are blossoming. The two men reportedly speak several times a week. There is certainly much to discuss, not least reforms to Spain's pensions and collective-bargaining arrangements that Mr Zapatero must drive through soon.
But the chemistry seems to work best when it comes to ETA. Backing Mr Zapatero, Mr Urkullu has said, ""creates a basis for peace"". Both men believe that the time has come for the weakened group to realise that, after more than four decades of violence, the game is up. The Socialists and the PNV are adversaries rather than allies in the Basque parliament. But the solid relationship between the parties at national level stops ETA driving a wedge between nationalists and non-nationalists, wrapping itself in the Basque flag and claiming its members as martyrs for the wider nationalist-separatist cause. 
The hawkish opposition People's Party (PP), which fiercely opposed talks between Mr Zapatero's government and ETA during the previous ceasefire, has kept quiet this time. That is largely because the government's tough line is now closer to its own. But observers detect the moderating force of the PP's leader in the Basque country, Antonio Basagoiti. Mariano Rajoy, the PP's overall leader, may also be thinking of the incipient peace process he might inherit if he leads his party back to power next year, as opinion polls suggest he will.
Yet none of the mainstream parties have much influence on ETA's actions. The group's moves towards peace have more to do with splits inside the radical-separatist world than pressure from the outside. Leaders of Batasuna, ETA's banned front party, mostly believe terrorism has had its day. They are also desperate to get back into politics, to recover the town halls they once ran and to exercise their political weight on behalf of the 10% or more of Basque voters who back them. Even some imprisoned ETA members have said they want the group to lay down its arms. Municipal elections are due in May. Either ETA abandons violence by then, or a large number of radical Basque separatists will be tempted to abandon it.",230,Spain,"Is ETA about to declare a permanent ceasefire?

A day later an ETA bomb at Madrid's Barajas airport killed two people and brought down a multi-storey car park. ""All we want from ETA is a definitive end to violence. A total and absolute end, forever,"" Mr Zapatero said in response to the latest rumours. 
The prime minister has new Basque friends to bolster him. Since October his minority administration in Madrid has been propped up by the six deputies of the Basque Nationalist Party (PNV), who provide their support in return for various goodies from the government. Relations between Mr Zapatero and Inigo Urkullu, the PNV leader, are blossoming. The two men reportedly speak several times a week. There is certainly much to discuss, not least reforms to Spain's pensions and collective-bargaining arrangements that Mr Zapatero must drive through soon.
But the chemistry seems to work best when it comes to ETA. Backing Mr Zapatero, Mr Urkullu has said, ""creates a basis for peace"". Both men believe that the time has come for the weakened group to realise that, after more than four decades of violence, the game is up. The Socialists and the PNV are adversaries rather than allies in the Basque parliament. But the solid relationship between the parties at national level stops ETA driving a wedge between nationalists and non-nationalists, wrapping itself in the Basque flag and claiming its members as martyrs for the wider nationalist-separatist cause. 
The hawkish opposition People's Party (PP), which fiercely opposed talks between Mr Zapatero's government and ETA during the previous ceasefire, has kept quiet this time. That is largely because the government's tough line is now closer to its own. But observers detect the moderating force of the PP's leader in the Basque country, Antonio Basagoiti. Mariano Rajoy, the PP's overall leader, may also be thinking of the incipient peace process he might inherit if he leads his party back to power next year, as opinion polls suggest he will.
Yet none of the mainstream parties have much influence on ETA's actions. The group's moves towards peace have more to do with splits inside the radical-separatist world than pressure from the outside. Leaders of Batasuna, ETA's banned front party, mostly believe terrorism has had its day. They are also desperate to get back into politics, to recover the town halls they once ran and to exercise their political weight on behalf of the 10% or more of Basque voters who back them. Even some imprisoned ETA members have said they want the group to lay down its arms. Municipal elections are due in May. Either ETA abandons violence by then, or a large number of radical Basque separatists will be tempted to abandon it.",True

THE Madrid metro station of Pitis sits in an urban wasteland, a shiny monument to Spain's housing collapse. Nobody ever came to build the apartment blocks that the station was meant to serve. Roads, pavements and streetlamps were all laid out--but then the property bubble burst. In a country with 700,000 unsold new homes, building-land right across Spain has plunged in value.
Pitis's echoing, empty station is witness to Spain's gloom. It is also concrete proof that Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero, the Spanish prime minister, was wrong to blame the country's tumble into recession and its 20% unemployment solely on a global credit crunch generated on the other side of the Atlantic. Spain created many of its own problems--toxic loans on building-land are just the start. These shortcomings have been ruthlessly laid bare by the euro crisis. Has Mr Zapatero seen the light?
Judged by his recent words, it seems that he has. The prime minister proclaims a new-found reforming zeal. ""There is something worse than the lack of a broad consensus about how to implement reforms and that is, especially at this moment in time, a lack of reform,"" he said earlier this month. 
He promises to reform pensions by January 28th and collective bargaining by March 18th. New transparency rules for banks, to clarify exposures to bad loans against building-land or unsold property, are in place. The same goes for regional governments, which account for a larger share of public spending in Spain than in other countries (see chart), and are now being asked to control their own deficits. Unions, employers and government have begun frantic talks to see if they can agree on more reforms to collective bargaining. Some hopeful analysts believe that Spain, which returned to (albeit very low) growth in 2010, is finally turning the corner. 
Mr Zapatero's new-found confidence and readiness to embrace reform has several causes. A deal with the Basque Nationalist Party (PNV) means that his minority government should survive until the election due in early 2012. The promotion of the interior minister, Alfredo Perez Rubalcaba, in October has given him an able, popular and hyperactive deputy prime minister. Mr Zapatero may choose not to stand again for prime minister, so he has little left to lose. Mr Rubalcaba looks an increasingly obvious successor as leader of the Spanish Socialist party.
Yet Spain's road to recovery is still fraught with dangers. The fall in house prices (of just 13.1% from the peak) surely has further to go. The burst bubble has exposed more than Spain's addiction to construction, which at its height accounted for 13% of jobs. It has also exposed the economy's waning competitiveness. According to a study by FEDEA-McKinsey, a consultancy, Spanish competitiveness deteriorated by 33% against Germany in the ten years to 2009. Membership of the euro precludes correcting this by devaluation. Mr Zapatero's conversion to reform may be genuine, but it comes late and may not go far enough. It is not clear that he accepts the case for wage cuts, for example.
The need for reform and austerity is urgent. As Portugal teeters on the verge of a bail-out, Spain yo-yos anxiously. It has just had to pay a steep 5.5% on a EUR 6 billion ($8 billion) syndicated bond. Spain's fellow euro members are looking for broader solutions to their sovereign-debt crisis, in which Spain (by virtue of its size) is by far the biggest risk. Mr Zapatero's government wants them to do more (eg, by approving the issuing of euro bonds) but, for now, the Spanish must look after themselves. 
Elena Salgado, the finance minister, trimmed the budget deficit from 11.1% of GDP in 2009 to under 9.3% in 2010. She aims to get it to 6% this year. Spain's national debt is below the euro-zone average and less than America's and Britain's. But, besides worries about hidden bad loans held by savings banks, investors see lack of growth as the main problem. A possible trap lurks: to regain meaningful growth Spain needs bigger reform, but austerity will also crimp growth.
Changes to pensions, at least, look safe. Mr Zapatero's deadline has concentrated minds. The retirement age will, with exceptions, rise from 65 to 67. But more labour reform is needed. He has given unions and employers until March 18th to agree upon changes in the inflexible, top-heavy collective-bargaining system. This produced wage deals outstripping inflation in 2009, though the current level is well below inflation. The government must also complete last June's modest labour reform by defining how companies facing losses might shed workers. There are worrying signs that in refining the details, the terms for such actions may be made tighter than had been hoped.
Yet the unions are scared. Mr Zapatero showed in June that he could act without them. He sailed through a tepid September general strike. Now the unions and government want a grand pact, including employers and opposition parties, to back reforms. The employers have shown willing. The unions still hope to water things down. ""My fear is that with the pact he will sell this reform out,"" says Luis Garicano of the London School of Economics.
The government has dragged its feet on reform in the past. A so-called sustainable economy law, which Mr Zapatero announced in May 2009, is still stuck in parliament. Mr Zapatero first mooted retirement at 67 last January. But he now looks more determined. If he can co-opt unions and employers, reforms should get easier. Germany, which maintained employment when its economy shrank in 2009 and then grew by 3.6% last year, is seen as an example to follow. Wage rises there were the lowest in the European Union over the past decade. A February visit by Chancellor Angela Merkel will be used to drive this message home. 
Mr Zapatero is also trying to save his party, which trails the conservative People's Party (PP) by 15 points in opinion polls and is expected to do badly in May's local elections. Quick reform could give the Socialists time to recover by 2012. ""The time for time-wasting is over,"" says the PP's leader, Mariano Rajoy. Will he sign up to a national pact?

HAS Spain changed at last? The prime minister, Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero, who is mistrusted by the bond markets and unpopular with Spaniards, would certainly like the world to think so. On February 2nd he signed a solemn ""social pact"" with unions and employers, covering pensions, collective bargaining and more. It was, Mr Zapatero declared, the most important such deal since the Moncloa pact of 33 years ago.
Under its terms Spaniards will, albeit with many exceptions, retire at 67 (instead of 65). Or at least they will do so in 2027, the year when the reform fully kicks in. That is far off, but Spaniards are set to be among the longest-working people in the European Union. First, however, they must find jobs. Unemployment at over 20% and rising is proof that Spain urgently needs a lot more change.
The pact came just a day before the German chancellor, Angela Merkel, who many think is holding Mr Zapatero's nose to the grindstone, was expected in Madrid. The hope was that she would return home to reassure Germans that Spain is not like giddy Greece, irresponsible Ireland or profligate Portugal, but a serious, austere, hard-working southern country that is ready to pop the pill of reform. 
If the Germans believe this, Mrs Merkel will find it easier to agree with her fellow euro-zone leaders to an expanded rescue fund at next month's EU summit. A bigger fund (and the social pact) should soften worries about Spanish sovereign debt, at least for the time being. Meanwhile Spain's shakier savings banks have been set on a path to recapitalisation and, in some cases, nationalisation by September (
). Yet it remains to be seen if all this will be enough to restore confidence in growth for a country that accounts for almost one-third of the euro zone's unemployed.
The new pact has left some important problems unsolved. A crucial reform to collective bargaining will not be settled until mid-March. In an interview Mr Zapatero himself points to the madness in the current system, under which Spain combined one of the euro zone's highest wage rises with some of its biggest job losses in 2009. Now he wants wage agreements linked directly to productivity growth.
The prime minister's belated conversion to reform is so earnest that, with or without prodding from Mrs Merkel and her fellow euro-zone leaders, he now insists that he would pursue it anyway. ""Spain is doing its reform on its own, not because anyone is telling us to,"" he says. ""I am in favour of sanctions being imposed on EU countries that do not comply with debt and deficit criteria.""
Mr Zapatero also remains committed to Spain's fiscal consolidation. He says that the government narrowly beat its 2010 deficit target of 9.3% of GDP. A contraction of GDP of 0.2% was also a shade better than forecast. He insists that he will meet 2011 targets of a 6% deficit and 1.3% growth. But if the growth does not come, he will not tax his way out. ""If there was any risk of not meeting the target, then we would do it by reducing spending, not by increasing taxes,"" he vows.
There are limits, however, to his reformist zeal. Mr Zapatero preaches wage moderation (and real wages are indeed dropping at last), but he does not embrace the idea that Spain as a whole needs wage deflation to compete. ""Not necessarily,"" he says. ""There has to be salary moderation. I think we have to look at it on a sector-by-sector basis and a company-by-company basis."" Nor does he believe that house prices have much further to fall. ""We are almost at the bottom (of the cycle),"" he insists. Many would disagree. Although 700,000 new homes remain unsold, house prices have fallen by only 13%. 
And what about growth? Famously optimistic, Mr Zapatero points to studies suggesting that Spain will grow faster than the EU average as early as 2013. But elections are due next year, and polls suggest that his Socialist party will no longer be in charge. Reform has come too late.

SPAIN'S unlisted savings banks, or cajas, are facing their own revolution. Last month the government announced that it would require Spanish lenders to boost capital ratios by September, or face partial nationalisation. That leaves several cajas, and at least one bank, needing to boost capital. Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero, the prime minister, says the majority of savings banks will attract private capital. But ""some will see their viability compromised and there the state will enter."" 
This is encouraging. The government at last recognises the need to do more to shore up its financial system. It has already injected EUR 15 billion ($20 billion) of convertible preference shares into the cajas via the Fund for Orderly Bank Restructuring (FROB) and the Deposit Guarantee Fund. Yet most Spanish lenders are still shut out of the wholesale credit markets. 
The government will require all lenders to raise core-capital levels to 8% by September. In the case of unlisted entities, or those with a high dependence on wholesale funding, the target will be as high as 10%. These ratios are far above regulatory requirements almost everywhere else in Europe, prompting complaints from the cajas that the new rules are arbitrary. Mr Zapatero says the higher capital bar is driven by the fact that savings banks do not have the same capacity to be in the capital markets, and therefore need to be stronger.
The questions now are how much capital the cajas will need, and how much private interest they can excite. The government reckons the total bill will come to EUR 20 billion, on top of the money already put in. Analysts are less sanguine. Their estimates range widely but have a mean of around EUR 50 billion of extra cash. 
As for private-sector interest, bankers say investors are jamming their phones. Perhaps, but investors want to know how FROB capital will rank alongside private capital and what influence regional politicians will have in future. A bigger stumbling-block is that the plan does not address the cajas' bad-loan issue head-on. Their total exposure to property developers may yet turn out to be lower than previously thought, because of the way loans are classified, but the cajas are still more vulnerable than the banks (see chart). Provisions are around 30% of souring real-estate assets for those savings banks that are involved in mergers. Given potential for further deterioration, a figure of 40-50% would be more prudent.
La Caixa, Spain's second-largest caja, is one step ahead of the game. In a complex operation which it hopes to close before August, it will inject its banking business into its listed holding company, Criteria. Intriguingly, it has left its foreclosed real-estate assets outside the listed bank, making the new ""CaixaBank"" more attractive for outside investors. Mr Zapatero rejects the idea of creating a systemic ""bad bank"" to purchase dud loans, pointing out that all Spanish lenders will soon have provided detailed disclosure on their property assets. But investors are wary. ""No amount of statistics will give you comfort until you do proper due diligence,"" says one.
To attract buyers, cajas are likely to go at a discount to listed peers. Even so, some clearly have more chance of attracting private capital than others. La Caixa is one. A new seven-member bank headed by Caja Madrid hopes to list before the summer: as the largest savings bank by assets, it will be a litmus test of investor appetite. Others will have to take FROB money to comply with the capital requirements, at least initially. Mr Zapatero says that these cajas could then be bought by a domestic or foreign bank, or by a large caja. Only the strongest savings banks will survive in their present form, he warns.

ON FEBRUARY 23rd 1981 Antonio Tejero, a lieutenant-colonel of the Civil Guard, burst into a crowded session of Spain's parliament, the Cortes, with a force of 186 armed police. The takeover of the Cortes was the spearhead of a wider coup plot. In Valencia a general decreed martial law and sent tanks on to the streets. The armoured division, based near Madrid, joined the revolt. The aim was to overthrow Spain's fledgling democracy (Franco had died just six years earlier) and replace it with a regime in which the army would still play a tutelary role.
Because Lieut-Colonel Tejero, with his extravagant moustache and tricorne hat, firing his pistol at the ceiling of the Cortes, looks in the endlessly repeated television footage like a figure from a bad operetta, it would be easy to dismiss the conspiracy as a quixotic melodrama. Yet it came worryingly close to succeeding. Slumped in a post-dictatorial recession and the seemingly uncontrollable terrorist violence of the armed group ETA, most Spaniards reacted with indifference to the coup. It failed because King Juan Carlos, to whom many in the army looked for a lead, refused to back it. In doing so, the king correctly saw that the future of the newly restored monarchy was indissolubly tied to democracy. 
In ""Anatomy of a Moment"", whose publication in English coincides with the 30th anniversary of what Spaniards call ""23-F"", Javier Cercas investigates how the coup attempt came about and how it unravelled. He does so largely through the prism of the only three people in the Cortes who disobeyed Lieut-Colonel Tejero's peremptory order to lie on the floor: Adolfo Suarez, the outgoing prime minister; General Manuel Gutierrez Mellado, the deputy prime minister and defence minister; and Santiago Carrillo, the veteran leader of the Spanish Communist Party. The three were divided by their past: Mr Suarez and Gutierrez Mellado were franquistas while Mr Carrillo had fought Franco in the civil war.

In Mr Cercas's view, to have insisted on ""the absolute triumph of justice was to risk provoking the absolute defeat of liberty"".

ON FEBRUARY 23rd 1981 Antonio Tejero, a lieutenant-colonel of the Civil Guard, burst into a crowded session of Spain's parliament, the Cortes, with a force of 186 armed police. The takeover of the Cortes was the spearhead of a wider coup plot. In Valencia a general decreed martial law and sent tanks on to the streets. The armoured division, based near Madrid, joined the revolt. The aim was to overthrow Spain's fledgling democracy (Franco had died just six years earlier) and replace it with a regime in which the army would still play a tutelary role.
Because Lieut-Colonel Tejero, with his extravagant moustache and tricorne hat, firing his pistol at the ceiling of the Cortes, looks in the endlessly repeated television footage like a figure from a bad operetta, it would be easy to dismiss the conspiracy as a quixotic melodrama. Yet it came worryingly close to succeeding. Slumped in a post-dictatorial recession and the seemingly uncontrollable terrorist violence of the armed group ETA, most Spaniards reacted with indifference to the coup. It failed because King Juan Carlos, to whom many in the army looked for a lead, refused to back it. In doing so, the king correctly saw that the future of the newly restored monarchy was indissolubly tied to democracy. 
In ""Anatomy of a Moment"", whose publication in English coincides with the 30th anniversary of what Spaniards call ""23-F"", Javier Cercas investigates how the coup attempt came about and how it unravelled. He does so largely through the prism of the only three people in the Cortes who disobeyed Lieut-Colonel Tejero's peremptory order to lie on the floor: Adolfo Suarez, the outgoing prime minister; General Manuel Gutierrez Mellado, the deputy prime minister and defence minister; and Santiago Carrillo, the veteran leader of the Spanish Communist Party. The three were divided by their past: Mr Suarez and Gutierrez Mellado were franquistas while Mr Carrillo had fought Franco in the civil war. But they were united by their commitment to turn Spain into a democracy.

IT IS the season for baptising unfinished bits of Spanish infrastructure. In eastern Castellon crowds watched the opening of an airport with no aircraft. Valencians welcomed a metro station with no trains. The deluge of half-finished or barely started projects worthy of tape-cutting is a harbinger of imminent elections in 13 of Spain's 17 regions and all its municipalities.
These are unhappy times for Spain's local politicians. Cash-strapped town halls and regional governments are trimming services even as the unemployed, now over 20% of the workforce, need help. The Socialist government of Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero is imposing austerity from above, and a stagnant economy produces few taxes. The Socialists face a drubbing. Strongholds like Barcelona or Castile La Mancha may be lost to the opposition People's Party (PP). Mr Zapatero has become a burden. He is such a liability that his party scrapped the Madrid bullring rally at which its leader opens most campaigns. It is assumed he will not stand for a third term next year. Some in the party want him to state his plans now, but rumours of an announcement this weekend seem wrong. Among those urging him to keep quiet are business leaders like Emilio Botin, head of Santander bank. Mindful of jitters in Portugal, they want maximum political stability to help a fragile economy. 
Will Spaniards really think about Mr Zapatero's plans when they vote? Few Socialists criticised the austerity measures that have sent their popularity plummeting. Even replacing Mr Zapatero before next spring's general election might not lift the gloom. The candidates to succeed him, such as Alfredo Perez Rubalcaba, his deputy, and Carme Chacon, the defence minister, are loyal to the boss. 
There are local issues too. Valencia has a corruption scandal in which the PP premier, Francisco Camps, is accused of (but denies) receiving expensive suits from subcontractors. In parts of Andalusia voters want to know why Socialist officials gave friends special pensions. In Catalonia the parties compete to sound tough on immigration. In Badalona, a working-class town just north of Barcelona, the PP candidate, Xavier Garcia Albiol, has won local support and national opprobrium for plans to push some immigrants out. ""When people stop me on the street, 80% of the time it is to do with immigration or crime,"" he says.
Badalona's population is only 14.7% foreign, not much above Spain's 12.2%. But Mr Albiol claims ghettos are flourishing, groups of immigrants flout the law and native homeowners are fleeing. The city's Moroccans, Pakistanis and Chinese do not share Badalona's ""social, family and cultural values,"" he says. Romanian gypsies are a bugbear. He pledges to withdraw housing benefits, school grants and other aid from ""trouble-makers"". Opponents say he is conjuring up racist demons in a country where immigration has not been a big issue. ""It is irresponsible to associate immigration with crime and radical Islam,"" says Xavier Bosch of the nationalist-run Catalan government. But Mr Albiol says his campaign is working. He claims he will take 30% of the vote, enough to become mayor, in a left-wing city where only 19% voted PP in 2008. 
He is not alone in waving the immigration flag in Catalonia. Socialist mayors from Barcelona to Lleida want to ban the burqa, even though the courts say they cannot. The nationalist Convergence and Union coalition wants a burqa ban and to make future immigrants take Catalan-language tests. Mr Bosch says his task is to integrate 1m foreigners (one in every seven Catalans) who arrived in the past decade. A survey finds half of Catalans thinking there are too many foreigners.

WHEN Enda Kenny, the new Irish prime minister, pleaded at a European Union summit last month for more lenient bail-out terms, his fellow leaders derided one of his arguments: that he had been overwhelmingly elected on a promise to get a better deal for his country. So what? We all have elections, they said.
In a club of 27 democracies, with an endless succession of national and regional ballots, electoral calculations inevitably colour decision-making. Yet domestic politics is now proving particularly debilitating to governments, whether conservative or socialist, northern or southern, creditor or debtor.
A fortnight after Mr Kenny's appeal, another EU summit was overshadowed by the resignation of Jose Socrates, Portugal's Socialist prime minister, who had failed to get his latest austerity plan through parliament. Two days later Angela Merkel, the German chancellor, so powerful in bending Europe to her will over the euro crisis, was weakened by two state elections. Her main European ally, Nicolas Sarkozy of France, was humbled in local elections on the same day.
Several others are weak as well. In the Mediterranean the Italian prime minister, Silvio Berlusconi, has just appeared in court for the first of several legal cases that threaten to undermine his leadership. Spain's Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero is hugely unpopular at home. In northern Europe, Danish, Dutch and Swedish anti-immigrant parties have new political clout. In Finland the True Finns party may do well in the April 17th election. And in Brussels a caretaker prime minister has run Belgium desultorily since an election in June 2010--beating all records for government paralysis. These days, in short, summits are like a mad hospital ward, filled with the broken-limbed, straitjacketed and terminally ill. No wonder EU leaders are struggling to cure the sovereign-debt crisis.
Take the summit on March 24th-25th, billed as the moment when the EU would finalise its ""comprehensive"" response to the woes of the euro zone. Domestic upheavals once again prevented united and convincing action. One reason was the political meltdown in Portugal. Many are urging Mr Socrates to apply for a bail-out, but he prefers to limp on to the election, in May or June. He is keen to avoid a return to the IMF-imposed strictures in the 1970s and 1980s, still remembered in a famous protest song. ""There is no power that can bend the IMF,"" it goes.
But a second difficulty was Mrs Merkel's decision to reopen the deal struck just days earlier by finance ministers on how to fund a permanent rescue mechanism for the euro zone. Worried that Germany would have to pay in too much capital in 2013, a federal election year, Mrs Merkel secured a deal to build up the fund more gradually, over five years instead of two. What if the fund lacks the money to save a country in need? Never mind, said the leaders, we'll think of some way of making up the money.
The third obstacle was placed by Finland, which is blocking any agreement on boosting today's underpowered temporary fund. Helsinki does not want to take on any additional burden before April 17th. A change would require a recall of parliament, now in recess, and boost the True Finns, who are riding a wave of anger over the euro-zone bail-outs.
Conflicting national interests have always dogged the EU. Even so, Euro-optimists say, it has been able to take far-reaching, even unpopular, decisions in times of need. It has gone further in toughening budgetary rules and integrating economic policies than anyone thought possible a year ago. True enough. Yet despite all that, the EU has not done enough to quell the markets.
So why are Europe's leaders so debilitated? To some extent, political fatigue has set in. Mr Berlusconi is in his third stint as prime minister; Mr Socrates and Mrs Merkel have been in office for six years. The economic crisis has also battered both those who are having to take harsh austerity measures and those having to lend them money. But deeper forces are also at work. Traditional parties have weakened with the decline of class-based politics. On the left, changing economic and social structures have shrunk the old working class. On the right, typically dominated by Christian Democrats, religious influence has waned and the anti-communist rationale disappeared with the Berlin Wall. Some voters sense the powerlessness of national leaders before problems like climate change and the financial crisis. Others demand protection from global economic forces and immigration. Fragmentation and disillusion create space for narrower groups, be they Greens, regional parties or a ragbag of anti-immigrant, anti-EU and far-right parties.
In short, stable majorities are harder to establish (a coalition even runs Britain, where the first-past-the-post system is designed for single-party government). And once in power, notes Peter Mair of the European University Institute in Florence, governments lose popularity more quickly, not least because they are constrained by decisions taken in Brussels. ""The mass party is dead, and parties no longer command the loyalty of their followers,"" he says. ""This leads to what Italians call immobilismo."" Real leaders, please
The answer is not to bemoan national politics, but to enhance democracy. In Europe the Brussels institutions could be made more relevant to voters, for instance by strengthening the influence of national parliaments over EU decisions. At home leaders must learn that voters are less tribal, more critical and better able to sniff out hypocrisy. That is a good thing, and places a bigger premium on sound leadership, credibility, conviction and serious argument. If Mr Sarkozy were less mercurial, Mrs Merkel less prone to panic, Mr Zapatero more convincing and Mr Berlusconi less of a buffoon, Europe would be less handicapped.",230,Spain,"How the weakness of national leaders is paralysing decision-making in the European Union

IT MAY have been inevitable, but it was a sad moment for Portugal: Europe's oldest nation state brought low. In a prime-time television address on April 6th, after months of denial, Portugal's caretaker prime minister, Jose Socrates (pictured), at last admitted what had long been obvious to everyone else: his country needed a rescue loan from the European Union. 
Portugal now joins Greece and Ireland in the euro zone's intensive-care ward. Its public debts are nowhere near as monumental as Greece's; its banks not as reckless as Ireland's. It has succumbed because of a humdrum failure to rein in wage increases and to modernise a bureaucracy schooled in tallying the quiet remains of the first global empire, as well as an inability to coax upstanding family companies, which for centuries have crafted textiles, ceramics and shoes, into competing with the Chinese. As a result, harsh as it may seem, a country whose collective memory is still scarred by the austerity demanded by the IMF in the early 1980s must once again subject itself to tough reforms demanded by foreigners. 
However painful for its citizens, Portugal's plight will not shock financial markets. The spreads on its debt have been climbing for weeks, particularly since Mr Socrates's government fell on March 23rd after failing to win support for yet more austerity measures (
). By April 6th ten-year bond yields had reached almost 9%, and the government had to pay almost 6% to borrow money for just a year. No country with a stagnant economy and a big debt stock can do that for long. Mr Socrates's decision represents a recognition of the inevitable, not a sudden deterioration of the euro-zone mess. 
Three things will now determine whether this marks the beginning of the end of the crisis--or the start of even deeper distress. The biggest immediate source of uncertainty will be the Portuguese government itself. Can a caretaker administration credibly agree on far-reaching reforms with a general election due on June 5th? Barely a week ago Portuguese officials said they lacked the constitutional authority to deal with either the IMF or the EU. Tellingly, they did not ask the fund for help on April 6th: Mr Socrates may be hoping for a bridge loan from Brussels without IMF involvement or many conditions. But the EU will surely not lend Portugal stacks of cash for long without the fund alongside or without tough reforms attached. Either Mr Socrates must get the opposition's endorsement for a deal or the negotiations could drag on until after the election. That could be dangerous; fears of endless delay could precipitate a bank run: Portugal has huge private-sector debt, much of it raised abroad and funnelled through its banks. Eventually, the country will have to sign up to a serious reform plan: the sooner the better. 
A second risk is contagion. Investors are bound to ask: ""Where next?"" Spain is the most likely (and alarmingly big) candidate. Although the spreads on Spanish bond yields have narrowed sharply in recent weeks, and continued to fall on April 6th, it cannot be complacent. Its banks are heavily exposed to Portugal. Its prime minister, Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero, has announced that he is not standing for re-election. Freed from the need to court popularity, he should now redouble his efforts at reform. What Brussels must do
But whether Portugal's capitulation marks a turning point in the euro zone's crisis depends at least as much on decisions in Brussels as on those in the Iberian peninsula. Getting Portugal's reform package right is the priority. The country surely has some financial skeletons: countries that borrow so heavily while growing so slowly usually do. But its main problem is a lack of competitiveness--which suggests a greater need for structural reform than for austerity. So top billing should go to deregulating cosseted industries and reforming the labour market. Portugal, one of the rich world's most rigid economies, must become one of the more flexible. Greece's experience (
) shows how hard this will be. 
European politicians' responsibilities do not stop there. This newspaper has repeatedly argued that the debts of Greece, Ireland and Portugal are unpayable and must be restructured. With all three countries now being ""rescued"", the politicians at Europe's core should start work immediately on an orderly restructuring of their debt.

WOULD Spain's Socialists prefer their leader to be a battle-scarred fox or a bright young woman? That is their choice after the announcement by Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero on April 2nd that he would not run for a third term next year. The vulpine character is the deputy prime minister, Alfredo Perez Rubalcaba. Spain's potential first female prime minister is the defence minister, Carme Chacon.
The Socialists may in truth need more than either can provide. Mr Zapatero's legacy is a deeply unpopular party overseeing a torpid economy with 20% unemployment. In the polls the Socialists are 16 points behind the conservative opposition People's Party (PP) of Mariano Rajoy. Much would have to go right to close such a gap. With a record 4.33m jobless in March and annual GDP growth at just 0.6%, that looks highly unlikely. 
But the choice will still matter. Party members who vote this summer will be picking the future opposition leader in Spain's largely two-party system. If the new leader cuts deeply enough into the PP's lead, Mr Rajoy may not win an absolute majority. In Spain, where nationalists from Catalonia or the Basque Country often hold the balance of power, that makes a difference. Controlling regional spending, in Catalonia or elsewhere, will be a huge task for the next government.
The energetic and wily Mr Rubalcaba is the more obvious choice. His many jobs include interior minister and party spokesman. He is highly visible. He is popular, especially among Socialists fed up with Mr Zapatero. A February poll found that the 59-year-old Mr Rubalcaba could slice the PP lead to just 4%. That could be enough to leave Mr Rajoy as many as six seats short of an absolute majority. 
But Mr Rubalcaba has some blots on his record. He cut his teeth in Felipe Gonzalez's Socialist government in the 1990s. That meant defending a government corroded by corruption and mired in the fallout from a dirty war against the Basque separatists ETA. Almost two decades on, ETA is again a problem. During a ceasefire in 2006 someone from Mr Rubalcaba's interior ministry tipped off some ETA men who were about to be arrested. This attempt at easing peace talks may yet see officials accused of collaborating with ETA. The PP is already using it to attack Mr Rubalcaba.
Ms Chacon would be a fresher face. ""She has more of a future than a past,"" commented one party heavyweight. In fact, the 40-year-old has run two ministries: housing and defence. Spaniards like their new prime ministers young: the most recent three were all in their early 40s. One poll has Ms Chacon as the highest-rated minister, ahead of Mr Rubalcaba. Her popularity owes much to the impact of a pregnant woman barking orders at a parade-ground full of soldiers. She would rally the female vote. And she is a big contrast to 56-year-old Mr Rajoy. 
Mr Zapatero's decision to go may revive a moribund Socialist vote on May 22nd, when Spain holds elections for 13 regional parliaments and all the town halls. But what nobody knows is how different a party led by Mr Rubalcaba or Ms Chacon would be from Mr Zapatero's. On current evidence, the change will be slight.

The second examines the price Greece is paying for going down the same path
WHEN Greece had to seek a rescue from the rest of the euro area and the IMF it was a shock. Ireland's fall from grace in late 2010 was less surprising. And there was nothing unexpected in the identity of the next country to seek refuge from the markets. For most of this year Portugal has been a dead man walking as far as investors have been concerned, its decision to seek official relief a matter of when rather than if. That question has now been answered: on April 6th the country applied to the European Union for help.
Jose Socrates (pictured), Portugal's outgoing prime minister, blamed his capitulation on the centre-right Social Democrats (PSD), the main opposition party. By refusing to support the minority Socialist government's fourth austerity package, he said, the PSD had precipitated a political crisis that forced him to resign on March 23rd, triggering an early election in June. Portugal and its banks had since seen their credit ratings downgraded to dangerous levels, Mr Socrates said. On the day Portugal turned to the EU, it had to pay a yield of 5.9% on one-year debt.
The outgoing government has not specified how much or what type of aid it has requested. Mr Socrates may aim for interim help that will see Portugal past two big financing hurdles on April 15th and in mid-June, and leave it to the incoming government to negotiate a bigger package.
Portugal's fiscal sins were not as serious as those of Greece and its public finances have not been wrecked by its banks as was the case with Ireland. Nonetheless they have long been wobbly. It was the first member of the euro area to break the rules of the stability and growth pact (in 2001); and debt is uncomfortably high, at over 90% of GDP, and rising. More important, it is stuck in an economic slow lane that makes it hard to repair its finances. 
Portugal has not been helped by its indecisive and bickering politicians. Mr Socrates made the fatal mistake of delaying a big fiscal consolidation. One of the final blows to Portugal's chances of staying out of the bail-out zone came when it emerged--in an echo of Greece's misreported finances--that last year's deficit was 8.6% of GDP rather than the planned 7.3%.
If Portugal's request was predictable, the outcome of this latest stage in the euro area's sovereign-debt crisis is less easy to gauge. The hope is that Portugal will be the last euro-area country to fall prey to markets. If the rot stops there, the damage will be containable. All three countries are small; Greece, the biggest, makes up only around 2.5% of euro-area GDP. 
The fear, however, is that markets will now turn their attention to a much bigger target--Spain. If it were to fall, the debt crisis would become far graver. Spain shares several of the weaknesses of the three fallen economies. Like all of them it lost competitiveness in the good times, and like Portugal and Greece it ran persistent and large current-account deficits. Like Ireland it had a runaway real-estate boom that has left its banking system with a pile of sour property loans. The Spanish government's moves to force its savings banks, or cajas, to raise more capital have helped, but investors believe the banks will need more than the EUR 15.2 billion ($21.7 billion) that the Bank of Spain thinks is required. Restructuring of the cajas is prone to hiccups, as the recent break-up of Banco Base, a planned merger of four savings banks, shows. Spain's banks are exposed to Portugal; the Spanish economy is vulnerable to rising interest rates because most household mortgages are variable-rate. Profligacy among regional governments is another concern.
Yet Spain is also different. Although its size is what makes some investors tremble, its bigger and more liquid public-debt markets also offer protection. After initial hesitation the government of Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero has taken some tough measures; the state expects debt to stabilise at 70% of GDP, up from 60% in 2010 but well below the euro-area average. Having said he will not stand in next year's election, Mr Zapatero can take more bullets.

THESE are unhappy days in Catalonia. Outside the regional parliament in Barcelona recently stood a picket of noisy secessionists, including a bare-breasted woman with a separatist flag around her neck. A road was blocked by public-health workers fighting cuts. An earlier traffic snarl was caused by demonstrators cutting access roads into the city.
Catalonia has a long separatist tradition, but the anger in Barcelona has more to do with the euro crisis than with an independence movement that won only modest support in a recent informal referendum. Last year Spain teetered on the brink over which Portugal, Greece and Ireland have toppled. It stepped back only by trimming a budget deficit that exceeded 11% of GDP in 2009. The Socialist prime minister, Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero, promises to get it down to 6% this year. 
That is hard in decentralised Spain, where 17 regional governments account for 37% of public spending. There is plenty of fat in bloated regional administrations: a study by Mario Garces for FAES, a right-wing think-tank, finds that their payrolls rose by 42% over the four years to early 2010. Last year Catalonia (which funds 335 public companies, foundations and other public bodies) was one of the most profligate. It overshot its share of the regional deficit target by 2.4 percentage points. Castile La Mancha did worse, producing a 6.5% deficit. Overall the regions' deficits amounted to 2.83% of GDP, out of a national deficit of 9.24%. 
This year's regional target set by Madrid is 1.3%. Catalonia's finance boss, Andreu Mas-Colell, says this would require a 20% spending cut. ""What country could do that?"" he asks. He does not want to administer such a sudden shock to government services, including health, education, policing, the courts and social services. His business-friendly Convergence and Union party of Catalan nationalists favours austerity, but wants more time. So he talks rebellion. ""This year we are cutting spending by 10%,"" he says.
And therein lies a problem. Catalonia is Spain's second-biggest region, after Andalusia. If it refuses to cut any more, it could add some 0.25% of GDP to Spain's deficit. And what might jittery bond markets think if other regions were to join a Catalan revolt? The budget head in Madrid, Carlos Ocana, insists he can bend wills by refusing permission to take on extra long-term loans. He squashes talk of a regional rescue fund. ""No bail-outs,"" he insists. 
Almost as worrying is the way Catalonia overshot, with Madrid late in spotting the problem. Some blamed November's regional election there. The outgoing Socialist-led coalition wanted neither big cuts nor publicity for their overspend before the poll. Thirteen other Spanish regions will vote on May 22nd. Are some hiding overspends? There is little hard evidence, but much suspicion: the government is now imposing quarterly reporting. 
Mr Zapatero claims to have imposed austerity without hurting core services. Mr Mas-Colell disagrees, accusing the Socialists of leaving the dirty work to others and claiming that Madrid is refusing to hand over funds it owes Catalonia. Mr Ocana points to the 30% of regional spending on other fripperies. Angry Catalan doctors complain that health cuts coincide with funding for a new regional television sports channel. Mr Mas-Colell says a deal with Madrid will emerge, but it did not happen at a meeting on April 27th, making bond markets jumpier.

But if you want a parallel for the anti-political protests that have swept across Spain, maybe it is to be found in Argentina in 2001-02, when years of recession ended in debt default and rowdy mobs shouted ""que se vayan todos"" (loosely, ""kick all the bums out"").
Fortunately, Spain is not Argentina--at least not yet. And the tens of thousands of mainly young Spaniards camped out in city squares have been impeccably well behaved. Even so, the protests may deter politicians from the grim task of saving Spain's economy from stagnation and banishing the fear of default. So may the crushing defeat inflicted on the ruling Socialist party of Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero by the conservative People's Party in regional and local elections on May 22nd (see
). Mr Zapatero was slow to face up to the bursting of the housing bubble, but over the past year he has pushed through spending cuts and some structural reforms. So the double rejection of his government has worried financial markets, already jumpy about resistance to austerity in Greece and Portugal. Spain, too big to bail out, matters still more. 
The surprise in the Spanish protests is that they didn't happen sooner. Youth unemployment is over 40%. Many young Spaniards live at home with parents who are themselves jobless and who may well be struggling to pay debts of their own. The protesters convey a mood more than a message. There is a faint echo of Spain's anarchist tradition in their anti-party, anti-union slogans, mixed with familiar anti-globalisation rhetoric. But there are two strands to their discontent that the politicians should listen to. 
First, the protesters have a point when they say that the political and media establishment has become aloof and self-serving. The politicians who crafted Spain's democratic institutions in the 1970s had good reasons for favouring strong parties and governability over perfect representation. The instability, fragmentation and polarisation that marked the last democratic experiment in the 1930s led to civil war and decades of dictatorship under General Franco. But the unintended result has been over-mighty and unaccountable party bosses. Corruption, though the exception, has often gone unpunished. So there is a case for looking at electoral reform, and especially at introducing an open-list system that would allow voters to pick and choose among individual candidates. Time for Rajoy to come off the fence
The second and bigger reason for the protests is that Spain's rigid two-tier labour market, bolstered by the unions, cossets the insiders who have permanent jobs at the expense of the young and unemployed, who are left out in the plazas. To his credit, Mr Zapatero has begun to cut the cost of hiring. He also wants to make collective bargaining more flexible. But more boldness is needed. Spain's best hope of growing its way out of its mess is through exports; given that membership of the euro means it can no longer devalue, that requires falls in the real value of wages.
Mr Zapatero wisely said this week that he would stick to his guns. But he is on the way out. His party quickly needs to choose a new leader, preferably Alfredo Perez Rubalcaba, the shrewd interior minister. As for the People's Party, it is savouring a return to power in elections due by March next year, even though its leader, Mariano Rajoy, has often been equivocal about reforms. With the local elections over, the protests will probably fizzle for a while. But Mr Rajoy should have no illusions. Unless he unveils radical plans to improve the lot of younger Spaniards, they will be back.",230,Spain,"How to get the protesters out of the plazas and into jobs

MICHAEL BANKS, a child in the 1964 Disney musical, ""Mary Poppins"", is an unlikely hero for today's angry Spanish youth. But his face features on some of the thousands of posters pinned to the walls of Madrid's central Puerta del Sol square, where protesters have been camped out for almost two weeks. The reason? He demanded his tuppence back from the Dawes Tomes Mousley Grubbs Fidelity Fiduciary Bank, and started a run.
As Spain's ruling Socialists reeled from a ten-percentage-point defeat at the hands of the conservative People's Party (PP) in municipal and regional elections on May 22nd--the party's worst-ever result--some found explanations among the tented demonstrators in Madrid and dozens of other Spanish cities. It is not that the protesters--an ill-assorted mix of anti-capitalists, anarchists and pragmatists bothered about corruption and electoral imbalances--changed voters' minds. It is that they, and people like them, might normally have voted for left-wing parties. On May 22nd the Socialists lost 1.5m, or one in five, of their votes. Yet the communist-led United Left coalition picked up only 210,000. Likewise, Mariano Rajoy, the PP's leader, focused his party's election campaign on the economy and jobs, Spain's two main concerns, but the PP gathered only 560,000 of the spare votes. Its victory was due chiefly to disillusion with the left, not great advances on the right. 
Still, this was an historic drubbing. It is best measured by the record number of regional governments and city halls won by the PP. The party will now run between nine and 11 of Spain's 17 regional governments, and have an important say in several more. The Socialists are left in control of just Extremadura and two regions that did not vote--Andalusia and the Basque country. But all of Andalusia's provincial capitals, including traditionally Socialist Seville, are now in PP hands. 
A general election must be held by the end of next March. Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero, the Socialist prime minister, announced in April that he would not stand again, hoping, probably vainly, to save his party by acting as a lightning-rod for voter fury. Few now doubt that Mr Rajoy, on his third try, will move into the prime minister's Moncloa Palace. The question is whether he will land the holy grail of Spanish politics: a parliamentary majority. If repeated, the PP's ten-point lead over the Socialists on May 22nd should do--just. Anything less threatens to leave Mr Rajoy without a mandate for the reforms Spain badly needs. 
Mr Zapatero's popularity has proved inversely proportional to the wisdom of his decision-making. For two years he denied that Spain was in serious financial trouble. His support fell only slightly, despite recession and galloping unemployment. But last May, as contagion spread across the euro zone's periphery, he executed a U-turn, embracing austerity and, to a lesser degree, reform. His ratings plunged. 
Now the Socialists must choose a replacement for him. A bitter fratricidal battle is looming, with calls for an emergency party conference to remove him as secretary-general. If he loses control of his party, Mr Zapatero might be dumped as prime minister, or even have to call an early election, as the PP has urged. A party meeting on May 28th was due to set the course. Alfredo Perez Rubalcaba, the deputy prime minister, is the front-runner to replace Mr Zapatero after Carme Chacon declared on May 26th that she would not stand. He would not represent a big change in policy.
As his party grows more uneasy, Mr Zapatero is sticking to an austerity path that aims to reduce Spain's budget deficit from 11.1% of GDP in 2009 to 4.4% by the end of next year. The OECD, a think-tank, says he is on target. The political cost is becoming apparent. But if the Socialists think left-leaning voters abandoned them only because of spending cuts, reduced civil-service pay and pension reform, they should study the demographics of the Puerta del Sol's unhappy campers.
The protesters are mostly students. ""Most live with their parents. Their problem is the lack of a future,"" says Ignacio Sanchez-Cuenca of Madrid's Juan March Foundation, a research body. Spain's already-startling 21% unemployment rate rises to 45% among the young. Growth, at just 0.8% over the past year, remains sluggish. A decade-long bonanza of private borrowing, followed by a spurt in public borrowing when the crisis struck, has left a heavy debt burden. Discharging it may depress growth for years. The Economist's May poll of forecasters predicts growth this year of just 0.6%, followed by 1.1% in 2012. That will create few jobs.
Provisional economic figures released earlier in May contain some worrying details. A surprise upturn in public-sector spending--which increased by 1.1% in the first quarter of 2011 after four quarterly declines--raises questions about decentralised Spain's ability to cut its way to fiscal health. Angel Laborda of Funcas, a savings-banks body, says regional governments and town halls may have been using this year's budget to pay costs from 2010. That implies a hidden extra deficit. 
Many of these administrations are now in the PP's hands. Thorough scrutiny should reveal the true state of the books. The PP now has a good chance to show voters how it would run public finances. So far, its record is mixed. The Madrid region, long a PP bastion, has the lowest deficit of Spain's 17 regions. But PP-governed Murcia is one of the worst performers. 
Markets did not celebrate the PP's win. Bond yields rose and stocks fell, stoking fears that Spain's attempt to ""decouple"" itself from the problems of other peripheral euro-zone countries may be in trouble.

SPAIN will soon be a country for old men. Most new prime ministers are in their early 40s. But the next one will be a grey-bearded veteran. The choice will be between Alfredo Perez Rubalcaba, the Socialist deputy prime minister, who must lead his party into a tough general election due by next March, and Mariano Rajoy of the conservative People's Party (PP). The voters are set to choose Mr Rajoy. An image consultant's nightmare, the bespectacled Mr Rajoy is a dull candidate. He looks like a provincial land registrar--which, indeed, he was before embarking on a political career. He has twice lost elections: his party is bad at ejecting losing leaders. Yet he may win next time with an absolute majority.
Spaniards still complain they know too little about what the enigmatic 56-year-old will bring. Victory will go to him because the election will be lost, not won. The voters savaged the Socialists in municipal elections on May 22nd, giving the PP a record ten-point lead. They had reason to punish their Socialist prime minister, Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero. A once-booming economy crashed on his watch. Unemployment is over 21%, growth may be low for years, bond yields are high and deficit-cutting is causing real pain.
Mr Rajoy has played watch and wait, being careful not to frighten voters with dramatic, drastic proposals. He has shed the ""nasty party"" baggage that damaged the PP in 2008. He has abandoned overblown claims that Mr Zapatero is tearing Spain apart by giving more autonomy to its regions or destroying the family. PP hints that the region of Castilla-La Mancha is bust or that Spain's health system will not survive the year also look alarmist. Mr Rajoy also rarely mentions terrorism practised by the Basque separatist group ETA. Yet many in the party, especially on the right, wish he were more forthright and dynamic. Others offer the faint praise that he will be a better prime minister than opposition leader. Some blame Britain's David Cameron, a fellow conservative: Mr Cameron scared voters by being too open about austerity, they say, and failed to win an absolute majority. 
All this leads to frustration about the PP's plans. ""I don't think anyone really knows what he will do beyond balancing the budget, and that doesn't help calm markets,"" says Jesus Fernandez-Villaverde, an economist at the University of Pennsylvania. ""The degree of courage will depend on the size of the parliamentary majority,"" says Lorenzo Bernaldo de Quiros, of Freemarket International Consulting. That the PP now runs many regions may not help, as some voters may start to see it as an incumbent rather than an opposition.
Mr Rajoy is famed for a trait of his native Galicia: leaving people guessing about his real intentions. But he is also tenacious. Plots to dethrone him as leader have come to nothing. In a party that covers the spectrum of the Spanish right, somebody will always gripe. He and his economic team deny they are hiding their plans, pointing to numerous parliamentary motions. 
A Rajoy government will try to repeat the trick of the first PP government of Jose Maria Aznar after 1996. It met its deficit targets, cut taxes and enjoyed strong growth. Mr Rajoy will quickly pass an austerity package and cut corporate tax. He will push through more labour reform, with or without union consent. And he will hack at business-suffocating red tape. But this is not 1996. Spain has fewer public companies to privatise and cannot count so much on European Union money. How the Aznar model can apply now will depend largely on Mr Rajoy's first finance minister. And who will that be? Like so much surrounding Mr Rajoy, it remains a mystery.

IT IS a bad time to be listing one of Spain's largest savings banks, or cajas. Even so, despite sickly markets and fears of Greek contagion, Bankia this week pushed ahead with plans for a EUR 4 billion ($5.7 billion) initial public offering (IPO) in mid-July. The move is risky, but so too is delay. ""There is a lot riding on this IPO,"" said Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero, the prime minister, this week.
The bank is the biggest of eight cajas that must raise fresh capital to comply with new government rules on capital (Banca Civica, a much smaller lender, aims to list the same day). The Bank of Spain reckons the system needs no more than EUR 15 billion, on top of the EUR 11.6 billion already committed by the state's Fund for Orderly Bank Restructuring (FROB). Analysts are less sanguine: estimates of the capital shortage range widely but have a mean of around EUR 40 billion-50 billion of extra cash. That is less than 5% of GDP and the FROB has a capacity of up to EUR 99 billion, but it is not pre-funded: raising that amount of cash in a hurry would be hard. The hope is that a successful IPO for Bankia will encourage other cajas to tap private capital. 
Bankia, which was formed by a merger of seven cajas, is run by Rodrigo Rato, a former IMF chief and Spanish economy minister with little retail banking experience. It has scale in important regions like Madrid and Valencia. The bank has room to slash costs: it aims to cut EUR 500m by 2013. If Bankia raises the new funds, its core capital will be just over 10%.
But investors worry that Bankia also has one of the largest property-loan portfolios in the country. Its most toxic assets have been moved into BFA, a holding company that owns 100% of Bankia, and that is in turn owned by the seven cajas. Bankia is not on the hook for potential losses at the holding company. But if BFA needs cash--for example, to repay EUR 4.5 billion borrowed from the FROB--it may have to sell more Bankia stock in the future, which could depress the share price. And Bankia itself still has nearly EUR 38 billion of real-estate loans and foreclosed assets; 16.5% of these loans are already non-performing, and that share will rise as house prices fall further. 
Another worry is that outside funding is hard to come by for all banks, including Bankia. Deposits have become dearer and banks are shrinking their balance-sheets to meet debt redemptions. Reliance on funding from the European Central Bank is climbing again. 
Everything has its price. Bankia plans to sell itself at a discount of up to 54% to its book value (including the new capital). That's beneath its peer group of commercial banks and lower than the 0.8 times book value of CaixaBank, the banking business of La Caixa, a better-regarded caja, which was due to list on July 1st via an existing quoted vehicle. 
Local demand and flexibility on price may allow the IPO to scrape through. Bankia's 11.2m retail clients are expected to buy about 60% of the issue. The real test will be the appetite among big international investors, and how the shares perform after it lists. Despite the worries, Bankia is right to push ahead. There is no guarantee markets will be calmer after the summer, especially if there are early elections. Spain has taken too long to recognise the weaknesses in some of its banks.

That's beneath its peer group of commercial banks and lower than the 0.8 times book value of CaixaBank, the banking business of La Caixa, a better-regarded caja, which was due to list on July 1st via an existing quoted vehicle. 
Local demand and flexibility on price may allow the IPO to scrape through. Bankia's 11.2m retail clients are expected to buy about 60% of the issue. The real test will be the appetite among big international investors, and how the shares perform after it lists. Despite the worries, Bankia is right to push ahead. There is no guarantee markets will be calmer after the summer, especially if there are early elections. Spain has taken too long to recognise the weaknesses in some of its banks.

EUROPE'S sovereign-debt crisis has already engulfed Greece, Ireland and Portugal. But the real fear is that it might spread to a large economy. Spain, whose GDP is almost double that of the three rescued countries put together, has long been a source of concern. Although it entered the crisis with relatively low public debt, at just 36% of GDP in 2007, that figure will rise to an estimated 68% by the end of 2011 because of big deficits. Worse, Spain shared several of the smaller economies' weaknesses, like a loss of competitiveness and big current-account deficits. 
The immediate threat of contagion from Greece receded on June 29th when the Greek parliament passed a plan for more austerity, opening the way for the country to get another chunk of bail-out money. But just as Greece's problems have not really gone away, nor has Spain's vulnerability. A land of striking physical contrasts, Spain has an economy to match. There are, in effect, two Spains, one vibrant and one sickly. Reinforcing one and reviving the other require painful reforms. 
An example of this duality is the fiscal grip of the central government compared with that of the 17 regions. Last year the centre had to make up for regional slippages. That allowed the overall deficit to fall as planned from 11% of GDP in 2009 to just over 9%, in the first year of an austerity programme belatedly introduced by the Socialist government of Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero. But the next milestone on the journey to fiscal sobriety--a deficit of 6% of GDP this year--may be harder to pass. Figures out on June 30th showed no progress in the first quarter of 2011.
One reason may be that the mix of retrenchment has switched: last year over half of the adjustment came from higher taxes, this year over two-thirds is to come from spending cuts. Whereas the central government determines the main taxes, more than a third of public spending, including on health and education, is undertaken by the regions. Jose Manuel Campa, the economy minister, says of the austerity measures that ""the regions have considerable fiscal autonomy so this is an effort that they as well as the central government must make together."" The centre can exert control indirectly through deficit targets and the right to veto borrowing. But Juan Jose Toribio, a former director of IESE Business School in Madrid, worries that these tools will be ineffective and thinks regional spending limits are needed. 
Another duality lies in the banking system. Observers fret that the Spanish state may have to pump a lot more money into the banks than the roughly EUR 25 billion ($36 billion), or 2.5% of GDP, it currently reckons will be the total bill from Spain's epic housing boom and bust (Ireland's bank bail-out bill is over 40% of GDP). 
The problem is concentrated in the cajas, local savings banks that make up around half the domestic banking system, rather than big Spanish banks like BBVA and Santander, which are protected by big international businesses. Not before time the government is overhauling the cajas. Their ranks are being slimmed--the number has fallen from 45 to 18--and they are being reorganised as joint-stock companies that can raise equity capital. Jose Maria Roldan, director-general of banking regulation at the Bank of Spain, says that the reform is ""a huge step forward, replacing the caja model with a standard banking template that is more secure and comprehensible to international investors."" 
The austerity programme and the reform of the cajas are moves in the right direction but neither will work if the economy continues to stagnate. The recovery so far has been disappointing, although one bright spot is a big reduction in the current-account deficit. Spanish GDP grew by just 0.3% (an annualised rate of 1.2%) in the first quarter, when the euro area as a whole expanded by 0.8%. The IMF forecasts that the Spanish economy will grow by just 0.8% in 2011. Most worrying, unemployment has soared, from an average of 8.3% in 2007 to 20.9% in May, the highest in the European Union (see chart on previous page). 
The source of Spain's egregiously high unemployment lies in the most pronounced division of all in its economy, that between insiders and outsiders in the labour market. Barriers to firing employees mean that employers generally take on new staff on temporary contracts. ""Old"" employees benefit from wage-escalation clauses that tie pay to prices. Astonishingly, real wages rose by 3.2% in 2009 when the economy shrank by 3.7%.
Faced with rigidities like this, a clutch of big Spanish firms like Telefonica, a telecoms company, have chosen to expand abroad rather than at home. Only about a third of its business is now in Spain. Mr Campa claims that labour-market reforms are ""going in the right direction"". Santiago Fernandez Valbuena, Telefonica's chief strategy officer, says that they have done nothing to make life easier for employers. 
That leaves Spain facing a grave social as well as economic crisis. Its youth-unemployment rate (for under-25s) is also the highest in Europe, at 44.4% (the average in the euro area is 20%). Although many youngsters can rely on family safety-nets, such bleak figures explain the explosion of anger among the Spanish ""indignants"". The twain in Spain
The dualities do not end there. As Rafael Domenech, an economist at BBVA, points out, they also include the gulf between the productivity of big exporting companies and small domestically oriented firms. This gap helps to explain why Spain has been able to defend its market share in world trade even though it has become less competitive on gauges like relative unit-labour costs. 
Whether the economy rides out the euro-area crisis will depend on which Spain prevails--the more competitive version or the hidebound one. It will require far deeper reforms than are planned. But with a general election due by March 2012, party politics are coming to the fore and the tempo of reform is slowing.

WHATEVER plans European leaders had made for their holidays are being disrupted by an adversary that never takes a break: the bond markets. A fortnight after yet another summit in Brussels to resolve the euro zone's debt saga, the pressure on Greece, Ireland and Portugal--the three minnows to have been bailed out by Europe and the IMF so far--has eased. But the strains on far-bigger Spain and Italy are rapidly worsening. The extra interest that both countries pay to borrow for ten years compared with Germany rose to euro-era records this week. Shares in Italian banks, stuffed with domestic government bonds, are being pounded on a daily basis. 
Markets are nervous in part because of national politics. Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero, Spain's prime minister, has announced early elections for November, which could mean months of distraction from the job of deficit-cutting (
). Italy's politicians pulled together well last month in passing an austerity budget, but many of the measures are backloaded and the country's leaders--not just Silvio Berlusconi but now also his finance minister, Giulio Tremonti--are mired in scandal (
).
Both countries can plausibly argue that their debt loads are sustainable. Spain's public-debt level is lower than the euro-zone average; Italy's is very high, at 120% of GDP, but it runs a primary surplus (ie, excluding interest payments). Yet the low growth and uncertain politics in both countries create enough doubt to spook investors, and there is far too little reassurance from the rest of the euro zone to settle them down. 
At every stage of this crisis Europe's leaders have reacted late and inadequately. The summit of July 21st continued the pattern. In particular, it failed to increase further the lending capacity of the European Financial Stability Facility (EFSF), the single currency's rescue fund. The EFSF's firepower is due to rise from its current EUR 250 billion ($357 billion) to EUR 440 billion in the autumn. If you assume that the IMF kept stumping up its share of rescue funds, the pot would be just enough to see Spain through the next three years without having to go to the markets: but it is nowhere near enough to cover Italy too. The safety-net beneath the euro zone's third- and fourth-biggest economies is flimsy, and investors know it. Heads from the sand
What to do now? The first thing is to get off the beach. Mr Zapatero has postponed his holidays; too many other leaders are off sunning themselves. The second task is to give some immediate shade to the exposed Italian and Spanish bonds. The July summit did agree to expand the EFSF's remit so that it can buy government debt in secondary markets. But Europe's institutional machinery grinds along at a pace that would shame snails. The summit's conclusions have to be signed and ratified by all 17 euro-zone governments before the EFSF can get busy. That could take weeks. In the meantime the European Central Bank should dust off its bond-buying programme.
The third thing for Europe's leaders to do is properly ringfence Italy and Spain. Dramatically expanding the size of the EFSF, to at least EUR 1 trillion, is one (politically fraught) option. But the EFSF is backed by guarantees from euro-zone members, so the burden on France and Germany, the two big funders, would rise sharply. French bond spreads are already creeping up: there is a risk that France could get sucked into the morass, too. The alternative to a bigger EFSF would be the issuance of Eurobonds that are jointly and severally underwritten by euro-zone members. That is a huge step towards fiscal union, one that Europe is ill-prepared to take. But increasingly, this looks like the least bad option.",230,Spain,"The markets once again are calling euro-zone leaders' bluff. Time to get ahead of things

HOWEVER bad the economic crisis in southern Europe may be for investors, it is proving lethal for the area's political leaders. In March Jose Socrates, Portugal's beleaguered prime minister, resigned. Soon afterwards his Spanish counterpart, Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero, announced his intention to step down. In June George Papandreou, Greece's prime minister, came close to ejection during a fierce debate over an austerity package.
So as he stood up to make the first of two eagerly awaited speeches to parliament on August 3rd, Italy's prime minister, Silvio Berlusconi, may have had an uneasy feeling he was one in a line of dominoes. If so, there was nothing in the style or content of his address to suggest it. Nor was there much to indicate that he appreciated the magnitude of the crisis facing the euro or the case for drastic action to tackle it.
Many analysts argue that the euro's difficulties are beyond resolution by any one member. But Italy is crucial. It is the biggest country on the euro zone's troubled southern flank, and its EUR 1.8 trillion ($2.6 trillion) borrowings dwarf those of any other country in the single currency. Mr Berlusconi's lacklustre, almost blithe speech looked like a missed opportunity to influence the course of events.
He was speaking after the Milan bourse had fallen for four straight days and Italy's borrowing costs had reached euro-era records. Hours before Mr Berlusconi's address, the yield on Italy's benchmark ten-year treasury bonds hit 6.25%, before slipping back fractionally. Giulio Tremonti, the finance minister, was summoned to Luxembourg for an emergency meeting with Jean-Claude Juncker, head of the euro group of finance ministers.
Not that Italy was alone. The day before, Spain's borrowing rates too had hit record highs (see next story). Both Italy and Spain face the threat of a self-fulfilling fear in the markets that they are fated to suffer a Greek-style financial emergency. 
A special euro-zone summit last month briefly calmed investors' nerves after Italy had been first contaminated by the spreading crisis. But doubts have persisted as to the effectiveness of a EUR 48 billion package of budget-reduction measures rushed through the Italian parliament in mid-July. A renewed bout of concern over the two biggest southern euro-states began gathering momentum on July 29th, when Moody's, a ratings agency, warned that it might downgrade Spanish debt. The yield on Spain's bonds started to climb, tracked closely by the return on Italian debt.
Both countries' borrowing costs have edged close to the 7% mark that heralded bail-outs for Greece, Ireland and Portugal. But even if Spain could--just--be handled, Italy is almost certainly too big to be rescued, and its presence on the international debt markets is daunting. Even though an unusually high proportion of Italy's treasury bonds and bills are in the hands of Italians, foreigners still hold around EUR 700 billion-worth of the things.
With alarm rising, Jose Manuel Barroso, head of the European Commission, issued a statement urging national leaders to get a grip. But Italy's billionaire prime minister was content to tell his fellow deputies: ""You are listening to an entrepreneur who has three companies on the stock exchange and who is therefore on the financial battlefield, aware every day of what happens in the markets."" Investors were making a big mistake, he hinted: Italy's economic fundamentals were healthy; its banks were sound (and their shares undervalued, he added).
Mr Berlusconi neither promised to stiffen the austerity package approved last month, nor to bring forward unpopular measures that will otherwise be left to the next government to apply. His most radical proposal was for an overhaul of labour law (if the unions and employers can be persuaded to agree).
Although investors clearly fear the spreading of market contagion, they also have concerns over political stability. During his address to parliament Mr Berlusconi again vowed to remain in office until 2013. Yet there is ample evidence that he is part of the problem. 
The same can now be said of Mr Tremonti, whose emphasis on fiscal rigour was until recently seen by investors as crucial to any solution. The finance minister remains vulnerable to a scandal involving a former adviser accused of influence-trafficking. Marco Milanese, who is also a deputy, made available to his boss a flat in one of the most fashionable parts of central Rome. Mr Tremonti claims to have paid him rent, but in cash--an awkward explanation for the man charged with ensuring that Italians pay their taxes.
More important is Mr Berlusconi's own vulnerability, which is increasing as supporters begin to fret over his waning popularity. His credibility is shrinking: the July austerity package was long on tax increases he had often promised to eschew. And he seems apathetic: before his appearance in parliament this week he had said next to nothing about Italy's financial crisis in nearly a month.
Mr Berlusconi's main ally, Umberto Bossi of the Northern League, whose votes keep the prime minister in power, was noticeably absent from the chamber during his speech. One of Mr Bossi's most senior lieutenants, Roberto Maroni, the interior minister, was there. But, intriguingly, he chose to sit among his party colleagues, and not with the rest of the cabinet.",230,Spain,"Silvio Berlusconi appears to have no response to Italy's deepening economic crisis
HOWEVER bad the economic crisis in southern Europe may be for investors, it is proving lethal for the area's political leaders. In March Jose Socrates, Portugal's beleaguered prime minister, resigned. Soon afterwards his Spanish counterpart, Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero, announced his intention to step down. In June George Papandreou, Greece's prime minister, came close to ejection during a fierce debate over an austerity package.
So as he stood up to make the first of two eagerly awaited speeches to parliament on August 3rd, Italy's prime minister, Silvio Berlusconi, may have had an uneasy feeling he was one in a line of dominoes. If so, there was nothing in the style or content of his address to suggest it. Nor was there much to indicate that he appreciated the magnitude of the crisis facing the euro or the case for drastic action to tackle it.
Many analysts argue that the euro's difficulties are beyond resolution by any one member. But Italy is crucial. It is the biggest country on the euro zone's troubled southern flank, and its EUR 1.8 trillion ($2.6 trillion) borrowings dwarf those of any other country in the single currency. Mr Berlusconi's lacklustre, almost blithe speech looked like a missed opportunity to influence the course of events.

THE game was up. Last week Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero, Spain's prime minister, announced that the country would hold a general election on November 20th, four months earlier than planned. In doing so, he was bringing forward a new era in Spanish politics. The unpopular Mr Zapatero, who has responded only belatedly to Spain's economic difficulties, announced several months ago that he would not seek another term in office. But he knows that his successor as Socialist candidate for prime minister, Alfredo Perez Rubalcaba, stands virtually no chance of winning the vote. Polls suggest that Mariano Rajoy, leader of the opposition conservative People's Party (PP), looks certain to triumph.
Mr Rajoy pledges reform, and Spain certainly needs it. The economy is stagnant. At 21%, the unemployment rate is by some way the worst in the European Union. With borrowing costs once again spiralling this week, Mr Zapatero was forced to postpone his summer holiday to cope with the crisis. Mr Rajoy called for the vote to be held sooner, in October .
Mr Rajoy realises that what Spaniards most want are jobs and a sound economy. But he also offers something that stretches credibility: austerity without pain. ""I do not intend to make social cuts,"" he says. 
Since May, when the PP soared to victory over the Socialists in local and regional elections, voters have had a sneak preview of the party in office. The PP now runs 11 of Spain's 17 autonomous governments; this matters in a decentralised country where regional administrations accounted for almost a third of the overall budget deficit last year.
The signs are not encouraging. Elena Salgado, the finance minister, wants regional governments to do their bit by limiting their budget deficits to 1.3% of GDP this year. At a meeting last week she urged them to return money advanced by central government in previous years on the basis of growth estimates that turned out to be overly optimistic. 
Not possible, squealed the PP regions (backed by Socialist Andalusia). Some claimed that sending the money back would squeeze their ability to finance health and education properly. Tiny Murcia--historically a big over-spender--even threatened to hand back administration of those services to Madrid. ""The government asphyxiates us,"" moaned Salvador Marin, the region's finance boss. In the end Ms Salgado blinked, offering soft loans to cover half the money the regions must return, and so in effect bumping up the national debt.
Some PP-run regional governments have eked out efficiencies, cut investment and merged departments. Madrid, for example, has been even more austere than the central government wished. But elsewhere, problems are mounting. In Catalonia, whose economy is as big as Portugal's, the minority nationalist government plans to run a deficit of 2.7% of GDP this year, more than twice Ms Salgado's limit. The PP, which props up Artur Mas's administration in Barcelona, has identified EUR 1.2 billion ($1.7 billion) of further savings. But rather than reduce the deficit further it wants this money ploughed back into health services. 
Mr Rajoy faces a dilemma over the coming months. To win votes he must seem moderate, but to gain respect from the markets and Brussels he must seem severe. For the moment, votes are what counts. One recent poll showed that the Socialists had cut the PP's lead to seven percentage points. If that transpires on election day, Mr Rajoy would find himself at the head of a minority government, with less clout over the economy.
Either way, cutting the deficit is likely to be one of his hardest tasks. He is against raising taxes so, if growth does not pick up, he must cut spending instead. This year Spain is aiming to bring the deficit down from 9.2% of GDP to 6%. Next year's target is 4.4%. In private, some in the PP acknowledge that Ms Salgado has made a good start. It is now time for their leader to show how he means to follow her.

WARM and languid, yet pregnant with autumn, August is the time for many Europeans to forget their cares. Factories and businesses across much of the continent shut down. Governments all but stop as ministers take a break. Even Charlemagne likes to sign off for a while. It is a time, too, when citizens might reconsider their reservations about European integration.
The Mediterranean, which had burdened northerners for over a year of sovereign-debt woes, can be rediscovered for its delights. Slow economic growth may not seem so bad when you can enjoy slow living under the Tuscan sun. Poor productivity in southern Europe suddenly pales next to its contribution to legend and history. By the waters of the Aegean, how angry can you be with the Greeks, who bequeathed the very name Europa?
Just a few months ago Angela Merkel, the German chancellor, admonished southerners for being lazy: ""We can't have a common currency where some get lots of holiday time and others very little."" But it is the Germans trekking southward in their caravans who enjoy some of the longest vacations in Europe. By law, they get to work fewer hours per year than southerners.
On holiday the euro reverts from curse to blessing; no more need to give money-changers a cut at every frontier. The passport-free Schengen area, often criticised as opening the doors to migrants, now makes for smoother trips. And, as they phone home, holiday-makers might even mutter a word of thanks for the European Commission's work to force down outrageous mobile-roaming fees.
August, then, should be a good time for the European project. But not this year. The French president, Nicolas Sarkozy, has told ministers to spend their holidays in France. They were, he said, ""entitled to rest, but not to a vacation""; they had to stay in close touch with their departments. Leaders worry that crises will erupt when governments are not on top of events. Wars have an odd tendency to break out in August, whether by accident (the first world war in 1914) or by design (Iraq's invasion of Kuwait in 1990). In August 2008 Mr Sarkozy himself was scrambling to end hostilities between Russia and Georgia. Foreign holidays can be politically damaging, too: Fredrik Reinfeldt, the Swedish prime minister, has been criticised for choosing a trip to Turkey over a memorial service for the victims of the Norway killings.
But this year there is good reason for trepidation: the financial markets do not take a break in August. Cyprus may be next in line for a bail-out (
). The island has been hit by multiple crises of late. Its large banking sector has suffered losses on Greek bonds, and its biggest power station has been knocked out by munitions exploding on a naval base.
Even more alarming is the situation in Italy and Spain. Both countries' bond yields have risen to alarming levels. If markets push them into insolvency, the euro zone would melt down. Already some reckon the two will have to drop out of financing earlier rescues of Greece, Ireland and Portugal, placing even greater burdens on a shrinking number of creditors. Some fear France will not be far behind.
Just a few weeks ago a quiet August seemed assured. The leaders of the euro zone had extended the maturities and slashed the interest rates on rescue loans, helping the three bailed-out countries. But they also exposed the vulnerability of Spain and Italy. The rescue fund, the European Financial Stability Facility (EFSF), is far too small to be credible. Moreover, plans to give it more flexibility to intervene pre-emptively have to be ratified by national parliaments--which are on holiday. Charitably, perhaps, senior officials in Brussels say governments deliberately chose not to expand the EFSF so as not to signal to markets that problems were looming in Italy and Spain. But markets have instead concluded that the euro zone is unwilling, or unable, to help them. Working holiday
So the August holidays are being ruined. The Greek prime minister, George Papandreou, is staying in Athens to oversee the start of an ambitious (over-ambitious, say some) privatisation programme that he hopes will stave off bankruptcy. The turmoil of the Arab spring is encouraging tourists to shift holidays from north Africa to southern Europe. But Greece's strike-prone workers, among them taxi drivers protesting against plans to open up their trade, seem determined to put visitors off.
Just before the break Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero, Spain's prime minister, called early general elections for November. He had to postpone his final holiday as prime minister (he will not stand again) to deal with the debt crisis. On August 3rd Silvio Berlusconi, Italy's prime minister, told parliament that the country's finances were sound. His finance minister, Giulio Tremonti, had earlier gone to Luxembourg for talks with Jean-Claude Juncker, who heads the euro zone's group of finance ministers. The French parliament is being recalled for an emergency session on September 6th to approve changes to the EFSF. But the Italian one will remain on leave until the 12th, so that MPs can go on pilgrimage to Jerusalem. Italy could do with some prayers, but what's wrong with St Peter's basilica? 
The return to work in September may yet bring the worst of the storm. Greece will have to negotiate the terms of its second rescue, and the IMF is more reluctant to keep financing a third of Europe's endless bail-outs. Opposition to the ever-growing cost of saving the euro will become more apparent. Very soon, as the days grow shorter and the rains return, leaders could face a momentous decision. Should they allow countries to default and break the currency union? Or should they try to save the euro by creating an unpopular fiscal union, complete with jointly backed Eurobonds?

America, Britain and other European countries called for the departure of Syria's president, Bashar Assad, after his continuing violent suppression of protests. 
Sudan declared a two-week ceasefire in the restive state of South Kordofan, where 200,000 people have fled from their homes in recent months. The end of the affair?
A judge in New York dropped all charges of sexual assault against Dominique Strauss-Kahn, a former managing director of the IMF. Prosecutors had asked for the case to be dismissed, citing doubts over the credibility of the hotel maid whose allegations against Mr Strauss-Kahn had led to his arrest and ""perp walk"" in May. 
Turkey stepped up its attacks on bases of the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK), an armed separatist group, in northern Iraq. After a week of air and artillery strikes, the Turkish army said it had killed up to 100 rebels. There has been a surge in Turkish-Kurdish violence since Turkey held a general election in June.
Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero, Spain's prime minister, called for a constitutional clause limiting the country's budget-deficit and public-debt levels. The plan comes after calls by Angela Merkel and Nicolas Sarkozy, Germany's chancellor and France's president, for all euro-zone countries to introduce such laws.
Italy's biggest trade union called a general strike for September 6th to protest against the government's austerity measures, though other unions described the move as irresponsible. Italy's parliament has yet to vote on the legislation. India fixated
Anna Hazare continued his hunger strike in a muddy field in Delhi, surrounded by thousands of chanting supporters. The elderly activist wants the Indian government to adopt his version of an anti-corruption bill. The prime minister, Manmohan Singh, pleaded with Mr Hazare to end his fast, noting that many aspects of his central demand for an independent watchdog are already in place. 
Karachi ground to a halt, as its biggest political party called a strike to protest against a wave of bloody mayhem in Pakistan's biggest city that has been directed mainly along ethnic lines. More than 100 people have been killed in the past week alone. The police rounded up dozens of suspects, mostly from gangs affiliated with political parties in turn associated with ethnic groups. 
A suicide-bombing at a mosque in north-west Pakistan killed scores of people. It is thought that tribal elders opposed to the Taliban were the target of the attack.
In Afghanistan the Taliban killed 12 people when they stormed the British Council compound in Kabul.
Myanmar's new government, ostensibly civilian but still stacked with military alumni from the old junta, offered more symbolic gestures to suggest a softer side. Aung San Suu Kyi, the opposition leader, was allowed to meet the UN human-rights envoy, having already met President Thein Sein. Her picture was allowed on the front pages of newspapers for the first time in years. 
Thailand revised plans for the development of a high-speed rail network that would have connected Bangkok to Malaysia in the south and Laos to the north--and to China beyond. Instead the new government said it will build lines to connect Thailand's capital to its other big cities. 
Thaksin Shinawatra, a former prime minister of Thailand who has been sentenced to prison in absentia, was in Japan on a supposedly humanitarian mission. Japan says Thailand's new government, which is headed by Mr Thaksin's sister, asked it to let him in. The Thais deny it. A political void
Jack Layton, the leader of the largest opposition party in Canada, died of cancer. In May Mr Layton led the left-of-centre New Democratic Party to its best-ever performance in a general election, winning 103 of the 308 seats in the House of Commons. His death means that the three main opposition parties are all without permanent leaders.
Chile's main trade-union confederation held a general strike, calling for a bigger state pension, changes to labour laws and higher taxes on business. The strike followed a wave of student protests against the centre-right government of Sebastian Pinera, but it failed to attract widespread backing. Most public transport and the mining industry operated normally.
In a first for Brazil, the government auctioned the rights to build and operate a new airport at Natal in the north-east. The government plans to award similar contracts for three other airports, including Sao Paulo's international airport, later this year. A long time coming
In Mississippi Johnny DuPree won a run-off ballot to be the Democratic candidate for governor, becoming the first black man in modern times from either of the two main parties to run for the job. He will face Phil Bryant, the Republican lieutenant-governor, in November's election to replace Haley Barbour.
The Congressional Budget Office predicted that America's budget deficit will be $1.3 trillion this fiscal year, slightly less than last year. But it sharply reduced its forecast of the cumulative deficit between 2012 and 2021 to $3.5 trillion from an earlier projection of $6.7 trillion, mostly because of the spending cuts that are included in the budget deal to increase the debt-ceiling limit.

WHO'S in charge here? As the jittery Socialist government of Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero, Spain's outgoing prime minister, pushes through a constitutional change to cap budget deficits, it looks increasingly as if Mariano Rajoy, the leader of the conservative opposition, is already in the driving seat.
Demands for a German-style ""golden rule"" deficit cap have long been a mantra for Mr Rajoy's People's Party (PP). Hitherto, they have met with Socialist scorn. Now the two parties plan to write a cap into the constitution before parliament is dissolved on September 27th. It is the first big change since the document was drafted in 1978, three years after Franco died.
Soraya Saenz de Santamaria of the PP solemnly announced the new cross-party agreement on what she called ""one of the main structural reforms needed by the Spanish economy"". From tone and content, a first-time visitor might have divined that the PP was already in power--which, according to opinion polls, it will be after a general election due in November.
Mr Zapatero's latest U-turn, like previous pirouettes on pensions, labour reform and spending cuts, was a response to the markets and to Angela Merkel and Nicolas Sarkozy. The German chancellor and French president jointly demanded golden rules across the euro zone in August. Spain will now get there before France. Only Germany currently has a constitutional ""debt brake"" in its Basic Law. If Spain needs EU help to keep sovereign-debt yields down, it can at least tell suspicious Germans that it is an eager, obedient pupil. 
In private, Mr Zapatero reportedly told Socialist critics this was the ""least harsh"" option left as sovereign-debt yields soared and the European Central Bank bought Spanish bonds in large quantities. But what will voters make of it? Some want a referendum. Opponents say the cap, which would limit the structural budget deficit to 0.4% of GDP from 2020, would tie the hands of future governments too tightly. Unions have called demonstrations.
But there are get-out clauses for recessions or national crises. And with the actual figure to be established by a separate--and more easily alterable--law, wriggle-room is guaranteed. 
Socialists fear that Mr Zapatero has handed the PP an early electoral gift. But Spaniards remain Eurofanatics, and the socialists hope they will get credit for this step towards euro-zone economic integration. ""If Europe is to adopt measures, we should be in the lead group,"" says Alfredo Perez Rubalcaba, the Socialist candidate for prime minister.
What the measure will not do is plug Spain's current deficit hole, likely to be 6% this year. Moreover, 2020 is light-years away in political terms, and with 21% unemployment Spain's more urgent need is for growth.

One involves claims that he was blackmailed by Giampaolo Tarantini, a businessman from the southern city of Bari who is alleged to have supplied more than 100 women, including numerous prostitutes, for parties at Mr Berlusconi's homes. The other, which focuses on Mr Tarantini's alleged pimping, led on September 15th to the release of some 5,000 pages of evidence.

It was already known that one of his guests was the girlfriend of a gangster--but not that he had put an official plane at the disposal of his alleged pimp, that he had obtained a visa for him to visit China, that he had found work for one of his shapely young guests on the publicly owned RAI television network and that he had arranged for Mr Tarantini to discuss juicy contracts with senior executives of Finmeccanica, a defence firm partly owned by the state.

IN THE Centennial Hall in Wroclaw, Poland, in early September, Jean-Claude Trichet, president of the European Central Bank, warned Europe's finance ministers how grave the global financial crisis was. The euro area, he said, was currently its epicentre, and the consequences could be much worse than anything seen so far.
But since most citizens are not yet feeling the pain, politicians are struggling to act decisively. A lightning visit to Wroclaw by Tim Geithner, America's treasury secretary, to express his alarm over the ""catastrophic risk"" of cascading sovereign defaults seemed to have little impact. The Europeans offered either excuses (decisions in a European Union of 27 countries are hard to reach) or hostility (America should sort out its own debt). After two days of talks, the euro-zone ministers came no closer to a solution.
One week later, at the annual meetings of the IMF and World Bank in Washington, the Americans and others, including China, berated the Europeans for threatening the world economy. In fact, there was some progress: the Europeans agreed that there must be a plan to ring-fence solvent but illiquid economies, beef up the main bail-out fund, the European Financial Stability Facility (EFSF), recapitalise Europe's banks and, not least, deal with Greece, which may yet default chaotically. But there was no agreement on any of the details of such a plan. 
The euro zone has the firepower to solve this crisis--its aggregate deficit and debt numbers compare favourably with America's and Britain's. But it is not a single entity, politically or economically. The currency is European, but treasuries are national and economies are only partially integrated. Each country wants to limit its liability for the debt of others and to curb the interference of peers in its economic policies. All 17 members have a veto on key decisions, which must then be ratified by unruly parliaments. Now the euro zone is trying to re-design itself even as it sinks--and every country is wondering whether to help others or save itself. 
Half-step by half-step
By its own ponderous standards, the euro zone has changed course quite fast. It has bailed out three countries, created an embryonic rescue fund and, only this week, toughened up fiscal discipline with threats of early sanctions for miscreants. Yet each belated half-step exposes how much is left to do. A deal agreed in July, including a second bail-out for Greece with a ""voluntary"" contribution from creditors, recapitalisation of banks and more flexibility for the EFSF, is still struggling through national parliaments; and, in any case, these measures are already obsolete. Contagion has spread to Italy, and nobody pretends that the EFSF, even after July's reforms, could save it without more money. 
The euro zone may have only a few weeks to come up with a more credible plan; the informal deadline is the next G20 summit in Cannes in early November. Are Europe's squabbling leaders up to it? To one despairing outsider, Austan Goolsbee, a former adviser to Barack Obama, Europeans are like the ineffective windbags in Monty Python's ""Life of Brian""--""where, you know, the guy comes out and says, 'We need to act,' and the next one says, 'You're right, let's draft--no more talking...I second the motion. Let's start doing something'."" 
One could easily imagine Jean-Claude Trichet as the hapless Brian, left to rot on the cross as his comrades walk away. To many, Mr Trichet has been the saviour of the euro, freely breaking with orthodoxy and acting decisively to buy the bonds of vulnerable euro-zone governments while the politicians talk. Others, though, see him as the politicians' lackey, and his purchase of sovereign bonds has driven two German colleagues to resign. 
Mr Trichet works hard at being a paragon of charm and composure. But his self-control crumbled earlier this month when he was asked whether the ECB was now a European ""bad bank"". ""We have delivered price stability over the first 12-13 years of the euro! Impeccably! Impeccably!"" he thundered, adding that he ""would like very much to hear some congratulations"" for delivering greater price stability in Germany than even the mighty Bundesbank ever managed. 
Mr Trichet is clever enough to find justifications for his actions: the ECB, he claims, buys bonds not to bail out governments but to help the ""transmission"" of its interest rates to the market; and it accepts dubious Greek collateral on the ground that bailed-out countries are by definition solvent. He rightly warned the politicians that their campaign to make private bond-holders take a hit in future bail-outs would only spook the markets. But he may be wrong to oppose any kind of debt restructuring for Greece, which is patently bust.
Mr Trichet could, in theory, solve the immediate problem single-handedly by announcing that the ECB would buy unlimited amounts of sovereign bonds if a solvent country came under attack. There are signs that it is ready to provide longer-term liquidity (up to one year) to banks and to ease interest rates. But Mr Trichet is the first to declare that the ECB cannot alone hold the breach in the bond markets.
In any case, time is running out for a grand move. Mr Trichet will step down at the end of October, making way for Italy's Mario Draghi. The change makes many nervous. The Italian central banker is impeccably orthodox in his economic thinking. Moreover he may find it hard, as an Italian, to expand the ECB's bond-buying when Italy is especially vulnerable. 
It's all up to Angela and Wolfgang
In the end, the future of the euro will be decided largely in Germany. It has the deepest pockets, and its post-war renaissance is intimately bound up with European integration. If Europe takes decisions slowly, it is partly because of Germany's complex federal structure and messy coalition politics. And for all the criticism, it is easy to understand Germany's hesitation (see Charlemagne). It faces an agonising choice: to back the euro with almost unlimited taxpayers' funds, or risk the break-up of the single currency. The government has tried to steer away from both horrors. Many Germans think it is already going too far, too fast towards a ""transfer union"".
Germany's slow response also has something to do with the personality of the chancellor, Angela Merkel. She is a physicist by training, methodical to a fault and ultra-cautious; faced with conflicting advice, her instinct is always to put off a decision. She may be fully committed to the project, but for her Europe is a cost-benefit calculation rather than historical destiny.
Not so her finance minister and one-time rival, Wolfgang Schauble, a disciple of the ex-chancellor, Helmut Kohl. Mr Schauble, who is wheelchair-bound since an assassination attempt in 1990, does not demur when interviewers describe him as the cabinet's ""last European"". His relations with Mrs Merkel have not always been easy. She became chairman of her Christian Democratic Union in 2000 after Mr Schauble was forced out of the job over his involvement in a party-financing scandal. These days the Merkel-Schauble dynamic is watched as closely as bond spreads. At least once, the chancellor has countermanded a deal struck by her finance minister. Mr Schauble is hawkish on the need for fiscal discipline and may be readier than Mrs Merkel to push Greece into a default, yet he is also more prepared for greater integration in the future, including joint Eurobonds, which the chancellor opposes.
Mrs Merkel may be lacking high-quality advice. Her newish economic adviser is Lars-Hendrik Roller, known for his writings on competition rather than high finance. He replaced Jens Weidmann, a long-serving adviser with an economics PhD who took over at the Bundesbank in May. Mr Schauble, for his part, has Jorg Asmussen as his Europe man, a Social Democrat kept on for his experience of financial fire-fighting. But Mr Asmussen is heading for the ECB, where he and Mr Weidmann--it is hoped--may be more flexible than their predecessors, Juergen Stark and Axel Weber. His replacement, Thomas Steffen, was the chief insurance regulator.
Yet personalities have less influence on policymaking in Germany than elsewhere. Powerful institutions such as the Bundesbank, the trusted guardian of economic stability, and the constitutional court, which has said Germany is close to the limit of how much power can be surrendered to the EU, do much to set the boundaries of the euro debate. Public opinion is ambiguous: voters tell pollsters they dislike bail-outs, but do not want to see the euro destroyed. 
The strange silence of Nicolas
Though pre-eminent, Germany still needs the support of France to get its way. In contrast with Germany's dispersed power, economic policymaking in France is concentrated in Nicolas Sarkozy's Elysee Palace. Francois Baroin, an inexperienced and floppy-haired political hack who took over from Christine Lagarde as finance minister when she went to the IMF in July, attends formal meetings with Mr Schauble. But France's ""real finance minister"", says one insider, is Xavier Musca, the presidential chief of staff. Mr Musca cut his teeth at the French treasury, working for Mr Trichet during the talks that led to the 1992 Maastricht treaty, the foundation of the euro. He is backed by Ramon Fernandez, head of the treasury, and Emmanuel Moulin, Mr Sarkozy's economic adviser. None is a trained economist. 
Although unpopular, the mercurial Mr Sarkozy faces none of Mrs Merkel's problems of public opposition to bail-outs. And he is never shy of a bold plan, particularly in the run-up to a tight election next spring. Curiously, though, French ideas have been modest of late. Mr Sarkozy tends to propose only what he knows Mrs Merkel will accept, such as the idea of a European tax on financial transactions. French officials may be keen on Eurobonds, but dare not speak of them in public. Perhaps this caution stems from Mr Sarkozy's worries about whether France is a creditor or a soon-to-be supplicant. French banks, heavily exposed to the troubled Mediterranean periphery, are wobbly. And as the most highly indebted of the euro zone's AAA-rated countries, France fears losing its place in the top tier.
The French president, though, may be about to secure a prize that France has long wanted and Germany has long resisted: European ""economic government"". For Mr Sarkozy, this means the 17 leaders of the euro zone meeting separately from the ten non-euro EU members (including Britain) to co-ordinate economic policies. Over time, this might lead to a new bureaucracy separate from the European Commission. In a smaller-core Europe, Mr Sarkozy thinks, France's voice will be louder. Yet to get this French-inspired institutional structure, Mr Sarkozy has to accept German ideas: peer pressure to promote fiscal discipline and economic competitiveness.
Other countries in the euro zone matter less than France and Germany. The fate of Greece is being negotiated over the heads of its prime minister, George Papandreou, and his bruiser of a finance minister, Evangelos Venizelos. Italy's experienced fiscal hawk, Giulio Tremonti, has been weakened by scandal at home and a row with his prime minister, Silvio Berlusconi. Spain's Elena Salgado has generally deferred to her leader, Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero; in any case, her Socialists are heading for defeat in an election in November. The Dutch and Finns, under pressure from Eurosceptic parties, are increasingly obstructive, as is Slovakia. But in the end it is still France and Germany that count. 
To organise things, they rely on their political fixer, Herman Van Rompuy, the president of the European Council. This former Belgian prime minister blends the austere demeanour of a monk (he famously writes Japanese haiku verses) with the wiliness of a French cardinal. He operates in the background, almost in the confessional, finding a point of balance between Paris and Berlin and then selling their ideas to leaders in other capitals. He will deliver proposals for economic governance to a European summit in mid-October; if adopted, these will undoubtedly shift power and influence within the euro zone. 
First, they will enhance the role of leaders at the expense of finance ministers, so giving Mr Van Rompuy a greater role as ""Mr Euro"" than Jean-Claude Juncker, Luxembourg's prime minister and finance minister, who chairs that group in the euro-zone. Mr Juncker has lived through all the single currency's vicissitudes, but these days gives a mumbling, wayward performance, admitting earlier this year that he has sometimes lied about the state of policy discussions. Having upset both France and Germany over the years, the hard-puffing Mr Juncker should have realised his days were numbered in March when smoking was banned from all summit meetings.
A second power shift is likely to be from the European Commission to national leaders. Though the commission is the traditional guardian of the European ideal, it is regarded with some disdain by the Germans and French. Even its friends despair of the timidity of its president, Jose Manuel Barroso, once Portugal's prime minister. It is hard to imagine Jacques Delors, one of his most energetic predecessors, lying so low with the euro in such a state.
Even so, the commission retains the bureaucratic power. Mr Van Rompuy often finds himself working with its ideas, and national leaders often end up endorsing its plans. Olli Rehn, the Finnish commissioner for economic policy (and a former professional footballer) is more capable than his stiff public persona suggests. And Michel Barnier, the French commissioner for the single market, is moving systematically to regulate the financial sector, often pushing Britain into rearguard actions to defend the interests of the City of London.
The shift to inter-governmentalism, Mr Barroso declared this week, could spell ""the death of the united Europe that we seek"". Striving to regain the initiative, the commission will soon push for Eurobonds and greater decision-making autonomy in its rescue fund. It's My Friend (or Foe?)
These days, the IMF has a big voice in the euro zone. Its quarterly judgments about Greece's performance will decide whether the country remains on life-support. And it is speaking more bluntly under its new managing director, Ms Lagarde. She infuriated her former European colleagues in August with a hard-hitting call for recapitalising Europe's banks. More recently her chief economist reinforced the mood of panic by warning that the world economy was entering a ""dangerous new phase"".
Ms Lagarde's tough tone may reflect the views of David Lipton, her new deputy, recently an adviser in the White House on international economics. Mr Lipton was a senior figure in the Clinton administration during the 1990s emerging-market crash. His priorities, notably boosting bank capital, also reflect official assessments of what worked in America in the earlier phases of its own crisis. He is becoming one of the most important non-European voices in the sovereign-debt debacle. 
European leaders such as Mr Barroso may well feel ""wounded"" by the patronising lectures of outsiders. But unless the euro zone's countries listen to good advice, and quickly act on it, they will face not just humiliation but economic catastrophe.
Caption: Juncker to Trichet: Any ideas?",230,Spain,"A look behind the drifting and squabbling to see who is really to blame, and what they're thinking
IN THE Centennial Hall in Wroclaw, Poland, in early September, Jean-Claude Trichet, president of the European Central Bank, warned Europe's finance ministers how grave the global financial crisis was. The euro area, he said, was currently its epicentre, and the consequences could be much worse than anything seen so far.
But since most citizens are not yet feeling the pain, politicians are struggling to act decisively. A lightning visit to Wroclaw by Tim Geithner, America's treasury secretary, to express his alarm over the ""catastrophic risk"" of cascading sovereign defaults seemed to have little impact. The Europeans offered either excuses (decisions in a European Union of 27 countries are hard to reach) or hostility (America should sort out its own debt). After two days of talks, the euro-zone ministers came no closer to a solution.
One week later, at the annual meetings of the IMF and World Bank in Washington, the Americans and others, including China, berated the Europeans for threatening the world economy. In fact, there was some progress: the Europeans agreed that there must be a plan to ring-fence solvent but illiquid economies, beef up the main bail-out fund, the European Financial Stability Facility (EFSF), recapitalise Europe's banks and, not least, deal with Greece, which may yet default chaotically. But there was no agreement on any of the details of such a plan. 
The euro zone has the firepower to solve this crisis--its aggregate deficit and debt numbers compare favourably with America's and Britain's. But it is not a single entity, politically or economically. The currency is European, but treasuries are national and economies are only partially integrated. Each country wants to limit its liability for the debt of others and to curb the interference of peers in its economic policies. All 17 members have a veto on key decisions, which must then be ratified by unruly parliaments. Now the euro zone is trying to re-design itself even as it sinks--and every country is wondering whether to help others or save itself. 
Half-step by half-step
By its own ponderous standards, the euro zone has changed course quite fast. It has bailed out three countries, created an embryonic rescue fund and, only this week, toughened up fiscal discipline with threats of early sanctions for miscreants. Yet each belated half-step exposes how much is left to do. A deal agreed in July, including a second bail-out for Greece with a ""voluntary"" contribution from creditors, recapitalisation of banks and more flexibility for the EFSF, is still struggling through national parliaments; and, in any case, these measures are already obsolete. Contagion has spread to Italy, and nobody pretends that the EFSF, even after July's reforms, could save it without more money. 
The euro zone may have only a few weeks to come up with a more credible plan; the informal deadline is the next G20 summit in Cannes in early November. Are Europe's squabbling leaders up to it? To one despairing outsider, Austan Goolsbee, a former adviser to Barack Obama, Europeans are like the ineffective windbags in Monty Python's ""Life of Brian""--""where, you know, the guy comes out and says, 'We need to act,' and the next one says, 'You're right, let's draft--no more talking...I second the motion. Let's start doing something'."" 
One could easily imagine Jean-Claude Trichet as the hapless Brian, left to rot on the cross as his comrades walk away. To many, Mr Trichet has been the saviour of the euro, freely breaking with orthodoxy and acting decisively to buy the bonds of vulnerable euro-zone governments while the politicians talk. Others, though, see him as the politicians' lackey, and his purchase of sovereign bonds has driven two German colleagues to resign. 
Mr Trichet works hard at being a paragon of charm and composure. But his self-control crumbled earlier this month when he was asked whether the ECB was now a European ""bad bank"". ""We have delivered price stability over the first 12-13 years of the euro! Impeccably! Impeccably!"" he thundered, adding that he ""would like very much to hear some congratulations"" for delivering greater price stability in Germany than even the mighty Bundesbank ever managed. 
Mr Trichet is clever enough to find justifications for his actions: the ECB, he claims, buys bonds not to bail out governments but to help the ""transmission"" of its interest rates to the market; and it accepts dubious Greek collateral on the ground that bailed-out countries are by definition solvent. He rightly warned the politicians that their campaign to make private bond-holders take a hit in future bail-outs would only spook the markets. But he may be wrong to oppose any kind of debt restructuring for Greece, which is patently bust.
Mr Trichet could, in theory, solve the immediate problem single-handedly by announcing that the ECB would buy unlimited amounts of sovereign bonds if a solvent country came under attack. There are signs that it is ready to provide longer-term liquidity (up to one year) to banks and to ease interest rates. But Mr Trichet is the first to declare that the ECB cannot alone hold the breach in the bond markets.
In any case, time is running out for a grand move. Mr Trichet will step down at the end of October, making way for Italy's Mario Draghi. The change makes many nervous. The Italian central banker is impeccably orthodox in his economic thinking. Moreover he may find it hard, as an Italian, to expand the ECB's bond-buying when Italy is especially vulnerable. 
It's all up to Angela and Wolfgang
In the end, the future of the euro will be decided largely in Germany. It has the deepest pockets, and its post-war renaissance is intimately bound up with European integration. If Europe takes decisions slowly, it is partly because of Germany's complex federal structure and messy coalition politics. And for all the criticism, it is easy to understand Germany's hesitation (see Charlemagne). It faces an agonising choice: to back the euro with almost unlimited taxpayers' funds, or risk the break-up of the single currency. The government has tried to steer away from both horrors. Many Germans think it is already going too far, too fast towards a ""transfer union"".
Germany's slow response also has something to do with the personality of the chancellor, Angela Merkel. She is a physicist by training, methodical to a fault and ultra-cautious; faced with conflicting advice, her instinct is always to put off a decision. She may be fully committed to the project, but for her Europe is a cost-benefit calculation rather than historical destiny.
Not so her finance minister and one-time rival, Wolfgang Schauble, a disciple of the ex-chancellor, Helmut Kohl. Mr Schauble, who is wheelchair-bound since an assassination attempt in 1990, does not demur when interviewers describe him as the cabinet's ""last European"". His relations with Mrs Merkel have not always been easy. She became chairman of her Christian Democratic Union in 2000 after Mr Schauble was forced out of the job over his involvement in a party-financing scandal. These days the Merkel-Schauble dynamic is watched as closely as bond spreads. At least once, the chancellor has countermanded a deal struck by her finance minister. Mr Schauble is hawkish on the need for fiscal discipline and may be readier than Mrs Merkel to push Greece into a default, yet he is also more prepared for greater integration in the future, including joint Eurobonds, which the chancellor opposes.
Mrs Merkel may be lacking high-quality advice. Her newish economic adviser is Lars-Hendrik Roller, known for his writings on competition rather than high finance. He replaced Jens Weidmann, a long-serving adviser with an economics PhD who took over at the Bundesbank in May. Mr Schauble, for his part, has Jorg Asmussen as his Europe man, a Social Democrat kept on for his experience of financial fire-fighting. But Mr Asmussen is heading for the ECB, where he and Mr Weidmann--it is hoped--may be more flexible than their predecessors, Juergen Stark and Axel Weber. His replacement, Thomas Steffen, was the chief insurance regulator.
Yet personalities have less influence on policymaking in Germany than elsewhere. Powerful institutions such as the Bundesbank, the trusted guardian of economic stability, and the constitutional court, which has said Germany is close to the limit of how much power can be surrendered to the EU, do much to set the boundaries of the euro debate. Public opinion is ambiguous: voters tell pollsters they dislike bail-outs, but do not want to see the euro destroyed. 
The strange silence of Nicolas
Though pre-eminent, Germany still needs the support of France to get its way. In contrast with Germany's dispersed power, economic policymaking in France is concentrated in Nicolas Sarkozy's Elysee Palace. Francois Baroin, an inexperienced and floppy-haired political hack who took over from Christine Lagarde as finance minister when she went to the IMF in July, attends formal meetings with Mr Schauble. But France's ""real finance minister"", says one insider, is Xavier Musca, the presidential chief of staff. Mr Musca cut his teeth at the French treasury, working for Mr Trichet during the talks that led to the 1992 Maastricht treaty, the foundation of the euro. He is backed by Ramon Fernandez, head of the treasury, and Emmanuel Moulin, Mr Sarkozy's economic adviser. None is a trained economist. 
Although unpopular, the mercurial Mr Sarkozy faces none of Mrs Merkel's problems of public opposition to bail-outs. And he is never shy of a bold plan, particularly in the run-up to a tight election next spring. Curiously, though, French ideas have been modest of late. Mr Sarkozy tends to propose only what he knows Mrs Merkel will accept, such as the idea of a European tax on financial transactions. French officials may be keen on Eurobonds, but dare not speak of them in public. Perhaps this caution stems from Mr Sarkozy's worries about whether France is a creditor or a soon-to-be supplicant. French banks, heavily exposed to the troubled Mediterranean periphery, are wobbly. And as the most highly indebted of the euro zone's AAA-rated countries, France fears losing its place in the top tier.
The French president, though, may be about to secure a prize that France has long wanted and Germany has long resisted: European ""economic government"". For Mr Sarkozy, this means the 17 leaders of the euro zone meeting separately from the ten non-euro EU members (including Britain) to co-ordinate economic policies. Over time, this might lead to a new bureaucracy separate from the European Commission. In a smaller-core Europe, Mr Sarkozy thinks, France's voice will be louder. Yet to get this French-inspired institutional structure, Mr Sarkozy has to accept German ideas: peer pressure to promote fiscal discipline and economic competitiveness.
Other countries in the euro zone matter less than France and Germany. The fate of Greece is being negotiated over the heads of its prime minister, George Papandreou, and his bruiser of a finance minister, Evangelos Venizelos. Italy's experienced fiscal hawk, Giulio Tremonti, has been weakened by scandal at home and a row with his prime minister, Silvio Berlusconi. Spain's Elena Salgado has generally deferred to her leader, Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero; in any case, her Socialists are heading for defeat in an election in November. The Dutch and Finns, under pressure from Eurosceptic parties, are increasingly obstructive, as is Slovakia. But in the end it is still France and Germany that count. 
To organise things, they rely on their political fixer, Herman Van Rompuy, the president of the European Council. This former Belgian prime minister blends the austere demeanour of a monk (he famously writes Japanese haiku verses) with the wiliness of a French cardinal. He operates in the background, almost in the confessional, finding a point of balance between Paris and Berlin and then selling their ideas to leaders in other capitals. He will deliver proposals for economic governance to a European summit in mid-October; if adopted, these will undoubtedly shift power and influence within the euro zone. 
First, they will enhance the role of leaders at the expense of finance ministers, so giving Mr Van Rompuy a greater role as ""Mr Euro"" than Jean-Claude Juncker, Luxembourg's prime minister and finance minister, who chairs that group in the euro-zone. Mr Juncker has lived through all the single currency's vicissitudes, but these days gives a mumbling, wayward performance, admitting earlier this year that he has sometimes lied about the state of policy discussions. Having upset both France and Germany over the years, the hard-puffing Mr Juncker should have realised his days were numbered in March when smoking was banned from all summit meetings.
A second power shift is likely to be from the European Commission to national leaders. Though the commission is the traditional guardian of the European ideal, it is regarded with some disdain by the Germans and French. Even its friends despair of the timidity of its president, Jose Manuel Barroso, once Portugal's prime minister. It is hard to imagine Jacques Delors, one of his most energetic predecessors, lying so low with the euro in such a state.
Even so, the commission retains the bureaucratic power. Mr Van Rompuy often finds himself working with its ideas, and national leaders often end up endorsing its plans. Olli Rehn, the Finnish commissioner for economic policy (and a former professional footballer) is more capable than his stiff public persona suggests. And Michel Barnier, the French commissioner for the single market, is moving systematically to regulate the financial sector, often pushing Britain into rearguard actions to defend the interests of the City of London.
The shift to inter-governmentalism, Mr Barroso declared this week, could spell ""the death of the united Europe that we seek"". Striving to regain the initiative, the commission will soon push for Eurobonds and greater decision-making autonomy in its rescue fund. It's My Friend (or Foe?)
These days, the IMF has a big voice in the euro zone. Its quarterly judgments about Greece's performance will decide whether the country remains on life-support.

Mr Rajoy's instincts are reformist, and an absolute majority would no doubt make his life easier. But Spain's economic predicament creates its own restrictions.

""The nightmare is over,"" declared Inigo Urkullu, head of the Basque country's biggest party, the moderate Basque Nationalist Party (PNV).

Concessions to ETA's demand for a separate Basque state are out. But the government could take other steps, such as moving some of the 700 ETA prisoners in Spanish and French prisons closer to the Basque country, or exercising leniency on day- and early-release programmes. Still, ETA is not in a strong bargaining position. Mass prisoner-release programmes, if they ever come, must wait. The problem of ETA members in hiding, like Mr Pla, is trickier. Most Spaniards want to see them in court. They may prefer to be exiled to a beach somewhere in the Caribbean.

IN AUGUST Silvio Berlusconi, Italy's prime minister, received a chilling letter. It warned him that ""pressing action by the Italian authorities is essential to restore the confidence of investors"". It set out a blueprint for privatisation and economic liberalisation, urging cuts in government spending so that the budget could be balanced in 2013, a year earlier than planned. This diktat was signed by Jean-Claude Trichet, president of the European Central Bank, and his Italian successor, Mario Draghi, who takes over on November 1st. The threat was clear: the ECB would help Italy only if the prime minister took action to bring down its vast debt.
Mr Berlusconi adopted a new austerity budget (with some dubious numbers) but did virtually nothing to accelerate Italy's sclerotic growth. So on October 23rd, at the first of two European summits intended to deal with the euro's crisis, he was told by Germany and France to come up with a credible reform plan in time for the next summit, three days later. ""Italy has to save itself,"" says one German official. If Italy does perish, the euro dies too.
Partly for that reason, Europe's leaders do not have a great deal of leverage over Italy. But humiliation has had a certain effect. At a press conference after the first summit, Angela Merkel and Nicolas Sarkozy were asked whether they were reassured by Mr Berlusconi's promises. The German and French leaders hesitated, stole a glance and smirked. The room burst into laughter. Rarely has a leader--from a founding member of the European Union, no less--been treated so disdainfully by his peers. George Papandreou, the Greek prime minister, is regarded more with pity than with anger. Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero, Spain's prime minister, has regained respect for belatedly pushing through reforms that cost him his leadership. 
Mr Berlusconi's friends feigned indignation at his treatment; supporters organised a ""laugh-in"" outside the French embassy in Rome (Germany commands greater courtesy). But even Mr Berlusconi does not appear to take himself seriously. The prime minister returned to Brussels with a letter long on self-justification and promises, most old and some new. But even his minor concessions are endangering his coalition. Mr Berlusconi blames Umberto Bossi, leader of the Northern League, for holding back pension reform. Mr Bossi, in turn, accuses Mr Draghi of trying to unseat the government. The ECB's letter, Mr Bossi says, was ""a fusillade against Berlusconi"". The euro's future could thus be determined by the actions of two Italians: Mr Berlusconi, the buffoon who may kill it; and Mr Draghi, the technocrat who may be the last man able to save it. Their new relationship may not start well; Mr Berlusconi broke off from discussions during the October 26th summit to tell an Italian television show that the euro was ""a currency without a central bank behind it"".
Mr Berlusconi rose from the collapse of Italy's old political order following the fall of the Berlin Wall and a succession of corruption investigations known as Mani Pulite (Clean Hands). He launched his own party; as a media mogul, he seemed fresh and dynamic. Court cases over alleged financial wrongdoings were an irritant but, in a country with widespread fraud and tax evasion, hardly fatal. At least, thought many, Mr Berlusconi might bring entrepreneurial vigour to government; his ribald comments about women were, well, part of being an Italian male. 
Set aside for a moment the squalid allegations of bunga-bunga parties. Mr Berlusconi's greatest failing has been his inability to reform the Italian economy despite ruling with a comfortable majority. Some saw him as a new Margaret Thatcher, but his economic liberalism was shallow; he perpetuated the old clientelism without the old parties. True, he has benefited from a weak opposition. But over time former allies, such as the Catholic church and business leaders, have turned against him. 
Some bits of excellence survive in Italy, such as family firms in the north of the country. In public life, the Bank of Italy is the last refuge of professionalism. It is as if Italian politicians have understood that, however much they mismanage the state, the central bank must be allowed to do its job. It is hardly unblemished (one ex-governor is appealing against a jail sentence), but it has produced a technocratic elite of sorts. It has bequeathed presidents and prime ministers (Carlo Azeglio Ciampi, an ex-governor, served as both) when trusted neutral figures were needed.
Mr Draghi is not entirely of this world: he served in the finance ministry, and also spent time in the private sector (at Goldman Sachs). Yet as the Bank of Italy's outgoing governor he has taken on its aura of competence and independence. He will preside over the ECB at a time of peril. Mr Trichet stretched his mandate by buying the bonds of distressed euro-zone states. He did so reluctantly, urging governments to take over the burden. But treasuries are short of money, and may never be able to protect large countries like Italy. If the firewall fails, only the ECB's unlimited fount of liquidity can quench the flames. Will Mr Draghi dare use it against the wishes of his biggest shareholder, Germany? Povera Italia
Nobody wants to test the proposition. It would help if Italy itself were less flammable. Yet Italy is stubbornly resistant to reform. The indolent political generation brought forth by Mr Berlusconi may finally be booted out, but there is no obvious replacement. One idea is to resort, as in the past, to a technocratic government to implement EU-inspired reforms, with support from all sides.
So 150 years after Italy cast off foreign rule and won independence, the country still needs the vincolo esterno, the ""external constraint"". For a time the role was played by the Americans and Europe. Now the constraint has an Italian name, Mr Draghi. If the euro is to survive, the ECB's new boss will need to save his country not just from the markets, but also from its politicians.",230,Spain,"One could doom the euro; another could save it
IN AUGUST Silvio Berlusconi, Italy's prime minister, received a chilling letter. It warned him that ""pressing action by the Italian authorities is essential to restore the confidence of investors"". It set out a blueprint for privatisation and economic liberalisation, urging cuts in government spending so that the budget could be balanced in 2013, a year earlier than planned. This diktat was signed by Jean-Claude Trichet, president of the European Central Bank, and his Italian successor, Mario Draghi, who takes over on November 1st. The threat was clear: the ECB would help Italy only if the prime minister took action to bring down its vast debt.
Mr Berlusconi adopted a new austerity budget (with some dubious numbers) but did virtually nothing to accelerate Italy's sclerotic growth. So on October 23rd, at the first of two European summits intended to deal with the euro's crisis, he was told by Germany and France to come up with a credible reform plan in time for the next summit, three days later. ""Italy has to save itself,"" says one German official. If Italy does perish, the euro dies too.
Partly for that reason, Europe's leaders do not have a great deal of leverage over Italy. But humiliation has had a certain effect. At a press conference after the first summit, Angela Merkel and Nicolas Sarkozy were asked whether they were reassured by Mr Berlusconi's promises. The German and French leaders hesitated, stole a glance and smirked. The room burst into laughter. Rarely has a leader--from a founding member of the European Union, no less--been treated so disdainfully by his peers. George Papandreou, the Greek prime minister, is regarded more with pity than with anger. Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero, Spain's prime minister, has regained respect for belatedly pushing through reforms that cost him his leadership.

FOR a taste of the real Spain, try Castile-La Mancha. This is the land of Manchego cheese and saffron. The vast plains are dotted with the windmills at which Don Quixote once tilted. Squatting incongruously among them is a EUR 1.1 billion ($1.5 billion) white elephant: Ciudad Real's airport. Other than the chirping of autumn crickets, the silence is absolute. The last commercial flights ceased at the end of October (the airport remains open to private planes). The only signs of life at the visitor centre are bats in the ventilation shafts. 
This airport tells a tale about Spain. In the past decade, during el boom, money poured in, inflating a huge construction bubble. Grand infrastructure projects like Ciudad Real airport sprouted. Many of Spain's 17 regional governments channelled cash into trophy schemes--universities, art galleries, high-speed rail--with no concern for whether they would pay their way. They were abetted by the cajas, small unlisted savings banks, often with opaque ownership structures, that lent recklessly on the assumption that property prices could move only in one direction. 
All these sins are evident in Ciudad Real's airport. Although private, it was backed by Castile La-Mancha's Socialist government. It was part-funded by a caja that went bust. After a couple of years of misery, in which passenger numbers came nowhere near estimates, the airport's managers filed for bankruptcy. It is tempting to call the project quixotic, but the owners got there first: the airport was opened under the name ""Don Quijote"" in 2008.
The story also explains why, in a general election on November 20th, Spain will eject its prime minister--the last of the five most troubled euro-zone countries to do so since the crisis broke. At least the exit of Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero, Spain's Socialist prime minister since April 2004, looks graceful next to the chaotic departures of George Papandreou of Greece and Silvio Berlusconi in Italy. Mr Zapatero's days have been numbered since April, when he said he would not seek a third term. Instead, he made Alfredo Perez Rubalcaba his party's candidate.
Mr Zapatero's legacy will be unhappy. When the crisis hit in 2008 the construction boom was already over. Yet Mr Zapatero would not accept that Spain was vulnerable. Its well-regulated banks had avoided dodgy subprime ventures, he insisted. But over the years the economy had grown unproductive, uncompetitive and unbalanced. By 2008 construction accounted for 10% of output, twice the euro-zone average. Wages had outpaced productivity. Although public debt remained low, private-sector indebtedness had soared. By the time Mr Zapatero saw the light in May 2010, it was too late. His reform efforts since have been halting at best.
The results are ugly. Unemployment in Spain, at 22.6%, is the highest in the European Union and the OECD. Among 18- to 24-year-olds it is an eye-watering 46%. The economy is heading into another recession. Spain is going to miss its budget-deficit target of 6% of GDP for 2011. The markets will ask some hard questions next year. And the man charged with answering them will be Mariano Rajoy, leader of the centre-right People's Party (PP).
Mr Rajoy is no stranger to Spaniards, having led the PP to defeat in general elections in 2004 and 2008. This time, thanks to disillusionment with the Socialists, his party has a double-digit poll lead and looks set to win an absolute majority, a feat that eluded Mr Zapatero. The stars have aligned neatly for Mr Rajoy. Unlike the new technocratic prime ministers in Greece and Italy, he will have a strong mandate for reform. He will be constrained neither by pre-election promises (he has made few) nor, probably, by the need to placate smaller parties. After sweeping local and regional elections in May, the PP runs most of Spain's regions, which account for one-third of public spending; this should make fiscal consolidation easier.
Yet the euro crisis will not wait. Mr Zapatero's belated reforms have eased some of the pressure. At a euro summit in Brussels on October 26th, the Financial Times reported that an early draft of the communique included a long section applauding Spain for its reforms above a section on ""Italy"" that was left blank. Bond investors agree. Since the European Central Bank first intervened to buy debt from the two countries in August, Spain has partly ""decoupled"" from Italy (see chart, next page).
For how long? Italy's difficulties only make Spain more vulnerable. The size of the PP's poll lead and investors' faith in Mr Rajoy have won time. But the new government, which will take office in mid-December, will still have to move fast. Luis de Guindos, an economist at IE, a business school, widely tipped to be Mr Rajoy's finance minister, says it must have a ""comprehensive plan"" by the end of February. Spain's destiny may lie beyond its control; this week it paid almost 7% in a ten-year bond auction, its highest since 1999. ""Our short-term fate is in the hands of the ECB,"" says Jorge Galindo, a public-policy analyst. Do not underestimate the quiet man
What can Spaniards expect from their next prime minister? Mr Rajoy's enigmatic personality fits the Spanish archetype of the gallego, a native of his home region of Galicia. ""People who work with him often don't understand what he wants,"" says Carlos Cue, a correspondent for El Pais. ""This is entirely intentional."" Lacking in public charisma, Mr Rajoy is said to be charming and witty in private. Although he lacks the belligerent streak of Jose Maria Aznar, his predecessor as PP leader and a previous prime minister, his persistence at the top of the party suggests a certain steeliness. ""He's not an active leader,"" says Mr Cue. ""He waits for others to make mistakes. Over 30 years this has proved a very successful strategy."" Mr Rajoy is not keen on international travel (to the despair of advisers) and, typically for Spaniards of his generation, not fluent in English. He has been taking intensive lessons this year, helped by his two young bilingual sons.
Some observers fear that Mr Rajoy is more likely to give Spain a gentle prod than the smack of firm government. But others say his conciliatory style is just what is needed: the more he can drag his country with him through the painful reforms, the more likely he is to succeed. ""He is a man of dialogue,"" says Jorge Moragas, Mr Rajoy's chief of staff and a possible foreign minister. There may even be an attempt to work with the Socialists in parliament. 
Either way, a degree of public disquiet seems certain. A general strike may come next year. But the unions are weak: a previous strike in September 2010 fell humiliatingly flat. Josep Lobera of Metroscopia, a pollster, says that no more than 20% of Spaniards will be implacably opposed to Mr Rajoy. ""Spanish society is prepared to accept reform,"" says Mr Moragas.
In the run-up to the election the PP has talked tough on the need for reform but been short on specifics. Mr Rajoy says unemployment will be his first priority, and he is likely to take up Mr Zapatero's unfinished work on labour-market reform. Antiquated rules, some dating from Franco, have left a deeply distorted system. Collective arrangements for wage bargaining create inflexibility. Spain's array of job contracts sets up rigid distinctions between protected insiders and vulnerable outsiders, especially the young, who toil on temporary contracts without job security, if they find work at all. No wonder thousands have become indignado protesters. 
Another issue is the banks. Earlier this year Spain's central bank took on the cajas, nationalising some and forcing others to merge. But their asset books are clogged with bad debts and repossessed property. Shrinking credit is a big threat to the economy. ""Banks need to be helped to do their job,"" says Ignacio Munoz Alonso, CEO of Addax Capital, a fund manager. ""That is to lend money, not to be large real-estate managers."" Worse may be to come: property prices are only 22% off their 2008 peak. Guesses at the recapitalisation needs of the cajas run as high as EUR 100 billion.
Then there is the question of where Spain can turn for growth, now that its construction adventure has juddered to a halt. Spain lacks Italy's broad industrial base, but as Rafael Domenech of BBVA, a bank, points out, it has a number of strong, diversified international companies. Exports are doing well, shrinking the gaping current-account deficit. There is a well-educated cadre of scientists and engineers, though links between academia and business are weak. With public spending shrinking the private sector has a lot of slack to take up. Cristina Garmendia, Spain's outgoing science minister, warns that slashing R&D in a fit of deficit mania will harm Spain's prospects. 
One piece of good news is that Spain is so riddled with inefficiencies that there are relatively obvious reforms to be made. Powers in such areas as health and education are distributed across central, regional and local levels, with inevitable duplication. Mr Rajoy has indicated that he plans to tackle this issue. ""There is an opportunity to introduce some rationality into the regional accounts,"" says Mr de Guindos. 
A potential trouble-spot is Catalonia, which accounts for a fifth of Spain's economy. The Catalan government, run by the nationalist, pro-business Convergence and Union (CiU) since an election last November, is at one with the PP on the need to control spending. ""On issues like labour reform we should coincide,"" says Andreu Mas-Colell, the Catalan economy minister. But, as several speakers at the party's glitzy election launch in Barcelona made clear, CiU is spoiling for a scrap with Madrid over the distribution of powers and revenues. Its first aim is to secure for the Catalans the right to raise more of their own taxes. The Basques enjoy this privilege, they say; why should they not as well?
Another priority is to keep more of their own money. Transfers to Madrid from Catalonia, one of Spain's richest regions, amount to 8-9% of the Catalan economy. Interviewed at his 14th-century palace in Barcelona, Artur Mas, the Catalan president, likens himself to Margaret Thatcher demanding a budget rebate from Britain's European partners. This ""Catalan agenda"", says Mr Mas, will be the price of his support for a Rajoy government in Madrid should the PP fail to secure a majority. 
Mr Rajoy will be hoping that the outcome for his party on November 20th will be as happy as the polls predict. He looks likely to get his wish. But for his sake and Spain's, he must hope that his reserves of luck extend far beyond election night.

Spain's array of job contracts sets up rigid distinctions between protected insiders and vulnerable outsiders, especially the young, who toil on temporary contracts without job security, if they find work at all. No wonder thousands have become indignado protesters. 
Another issue is the banks. Earlier this year Spain's central bank took on the cajas, nationalising some and forcing others to merge. But their asset books are clogged with bad debts and repossessed property. Shrinking credit is a big threat to the economy. ""Banks need to be helped to do their job,"" says Ignacio Munoz Alonso, CEO of Addax Capital, a fund manager. ""That is to lend money, not to be large real-estate managers."" Worse may be to come: property prices are only 22% off their 2008 peak. Guesses at the recapitalisation needs of the cajas run as high as EUR 100 billion.
Then there is the question of where Spain can turn for growth, now that its construction adventure has juddered to a halt. Spain lacks Italy's broad industrial base, but as Rafael Domenech of BBVA, a bank, points out, it has a number of strong, diversified international companies. Exports are doing well, shrinking the gaping current-account deficit. There is a well-educated cadre of scientists and engineers, though links between academia and business are weak. With public spending shrinking the private sector has a lot of slack to take up. Cristina Garmendia, Spain's outgoing science minister, warns that slashing R&D in a fit of deficit mania will harm Spain's prospects. 
One piece of good news is that Spain is so riddled with inefficiencies that there are relatively obvious reforms to be made. Powers in such areas as health and education are distributed across central, regional and local levels, with inevitable duplication. Mr Rajoy has indicated that he plans to tackle this issue. ""There is an opportunity to introduce some rationality into the regional accounts,"" says Mr de Guindos. 
A potential trouble-spot is Catalonia, which accounts for a fifth of Spain's economy. The Catalan government, run by the nationalist, pro-business Convergence and Union (CiU) since an election last November, is at one with the PP on the need to control spending. ""On issues like labour reform we should coincide,"" says Andreu Mas-Colell, the Catalan economy minister. But, as several speakers at the party's glitzy election launch in Barcelona made clear, CiU is spoiling for a scrap with Madrid over the distribution of powers and revenues. Its first aim is to secure for the Catalans the right to raise more of their own taxes. The Basques enjoy this privilege, they say; why should they not as well?
Another priority is to keep more of their own money. Transfers to Madrid from Catalonia, one of Spain's richest regions, amount to 8-9% of the Catalan economy. Interviewed at his 14th-century palace in Barcelona, Artur Mas, the Catalan president, likens himself to Margaret Thatcher demanding a budget rebate from Britain's European partners. This ""Catalan agenda"", says Mr Mas, will be the price of his support for a Rajoy government in Madrid should the PP fail to secure a majority. 
Mr Rajoy will be hoping that the outcome for his party on November 20th will be as happy as the polls predict. He looks likely to get his wish. But for his sake and Spain's, he must hope that his reserves of luck extend far beyond election night.

NO WONDER that, even in his moment of triumph, Mariano Rajoy seemed impatient with the jubilant celebrations by supporters of his conservative People's Party. On November 20th Mr Rajoy led the PP to an absolute majority in the Spanish parliament with the biggest margin of victory since 1982 (see
). He did so despite (or perhaps because of) his promise to be more rigorous than the outgoing Socialist government of Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero in imposing austerity to keep Spain in the euro zone. Yet Mr Rajoy knows that, with the markets in a eurofunk and bond yields at eye-watering highs, mere promises count for little. 
His victory was in part a tribute to the dogged persistence and quiet moderation of a man who has led his party for eight years. But it owed more to Spaniards' rejection of his predecessor. Mr Zapatero will be remembered for liberalising measures, such as on gay marriage and abortion, that helped to make Spain a more modern, tolerant place. But he was slow to see that a housing bubble masked a loss of competitiveness, and slower still to react to the crash. His political frivolity was summed up by his decision in July to call an early election on a drawn-out timetable that keeps him in office until next month.
Mr Rajoy looks to be made of sterner stuff. His first task will be to make bigger spending cuts to meet fiscal targets agreed on with the European Commission. But austerity alone will not cut Spain's horrendous unemployment rolls (close to 5m-strong, with more than 45% of youngsters out of work). The test facing the new government is how to get back to growth. One answer is to complete the clean-up of the banks to get credit flowing again.
Another is to cut unhelpful regulation. Mr Zapatero merely tinkered with a dysfunctional labour market, in which the difficulty of firing incumbents deters hiring and binding national agreements decree unaffordable wage rises. Mr Rajoy has rightly promised comprehensive reform. Growth is also held back by red tape. Much of this stems from Spain's exaggerated decentralisation. The democratic constitution's creation of 17 autonomous regions tried to reverse Franco's heavy-handed centralisation, while keeping enough national control to satisfy the right, long nervous about self-government of Basques, Catalans and Galicians. In fact it has led to waste in public spending and to 17 sets of business regulations, fragmenting the national market and increasing costs. And it has failed to settle Spain's historic quarrels: Basque and Catalan nationalists have exploited their status as coalition partners of the two main parties to demand ever more powers. One country--or 17?
Mr Rajoy's absolute majority in parliament plus his party's control over many of Spain's regions could allow him to start rolling back this trend. He should be cheered that a new centrist group which split from the Socialists in protest over Mr Zapatero's toadying to the regions took almost 5% of the vote. Although Basque separatists, boosted by the end of ETA's terrorism, and Catalan nationalists also did well, one lesson of the euro crisis applies also at home: too much splintering makes governing an economic union harder.
For all Mr Zapatero's dilatoriness, Spain has taken more decisive action than Italy to tackle the budget deficit. Unlike Italy and Greece, it now has a new government with the fresh energy provided by a thumping democratic mandate. Mr Rajoy knows that the euro's survival depends on Germany summoning up the political will: it was no coincidence that he was soon on the phone to Angela Merkel.

IT IS an historic opportunity. Not since Felipe Gonzalez's Socialists swept to victory in 1982 has a Spanish leader been handed as big a mandate for change. On November 20th Mariano Rajoy's People's Party (PP) took 186 out of the 350 seats in the parliament, meaning that he has no need to barter with smaller parties. The PP's control of two-thirds of regions and 40% of town halls should allow him to push reform throughout the system. A March poll in Andalusia, in the south, where the PP may end decades of Socialist hegemony, is the only election looming. Mr Rajoy enjoys both freedom and huge power.
On the other hand, Spain's problems are huge too: zero growth at best, bond yields near bail-out levels and unemployment at 23% (and 46% for youths). Reminders of the grim outlook have come daily since Mr Rajoy's victory. The small Bank of Valencia has had to be rescued. Funcas, a think-tank, predicts a 0.5% drop in GDP next year. And bond yields keep breaking unwelcome records. Only urgent action can ease the pressure. But it cannot come before late December, when the handover of power is complete. Until then, Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero, whose Socialists lost a third of their seats, stays in charge.
How will Mr Rajoy use his strength? The sphinx-like leader is staying mostly mum for now. But two post-election speeches and his deliberately detail-light manifesto offer some clues. He promised to regain respect in Brussels and Frankfurt. A day later he professed a deep-seated love of the European Union. Spain, in other words, is determined to stay in the euro. Whatever the pain, it will try to hit deficit targets of 4.4% of GDP in 2012 and 3% in 2013. With this year's deficit over 6% and recession looming, that will take big spending cuts and tax rises. The regions offer to help: Catalonia plans to cut pay, and Madrid has set aside a contingency fund in case income runs short in 2012. 
But if Spain is to be the good pupil of southern Europe, it also wants to be teacher's pet. More specifically, it wants gold stars from Germany's Angela Merkel. ""Those who comply cannot be treated in the same way as those who don't,"" said Mr Rajoy's deputy, Maria Dolores de Cospedal. The implication is that the European Central Bank should stand behind Spanish government bonds in order to prevent a bail-out, and that Mrs Merkel should publicly back Spain. Reform takes time to spark growth; Mr Rajoy cannot hold the markets at bay alone.
He starts with some advantages. In a nod to Mr Zapatero's efforts, Fitch, a ratings agency, has talked of ""a strong recent record of taking additional measures to meet its fiscal targets"". Unlike his predecessor, Mr Rajoy needs to make no political U-turn. He is already preaching austerity and reform. Nor will he behave like Italy's backsliding Silvio Berlusconi. Indeed, he is rather more in tune with Mrs Merkel than with France's Nicolas Sarkozy.
So will the ECB and Germany answer the call? Mrs Merkel demands instant action. ""You have received a clear mandate from your people to decide on and quickly apply the necessary reform measures,"" she told Mr Rajoy after the election. Reforms matter as much as deficit targets. Mr Rajoy wants to cut taxes to boost growth, but there is little room. He has also vowed to maintain the spending power of pensions, which Mr Zapatero froze.
Who will mastermind reform? A former economic secretary, Luis de Guindos, leads the betting for finance minister. Soraya Saenz de Santamaria, a long-term party aide, and Alberto Ruiz-Gallardon, Madrid's mayor, look set to be cabinet stars. PP governments also often favour party members from the upper echelons of the civil service: political technocrats. 
The key to reform is to make the state more efficient and boost growth, all at minimal cost. Labour-market reform is high on the list. Setting a long-term deficit cap, as permitted by a recent constitutional amendment, will be another big task. The centrist Union for Progress and Democracy, Spain's fourth party, which did well in the election, says 2.6% of GDP could be saved by spreading best practices across regions and cities. Another 1.6% might come from town-hall mergers. Some of the 5,000 bodies owned by regions or town halls, from broadcasters to garbage collectors, could be closed or sold. Many PP regions would jump at privatising local broadcasters. And there is talk of recentralising some powers. Madrid's PP regional boss, Esperanza Aguirre, would happily hand back control of the courts. But independent-minded Catalans and Basques will resist. The savings may be elusive.

AFTER nearly eight years in opposition Spain's conservative People's Party (PP) is back in power. But the ministers appointed by Mariano Rajoy, the new prime minister, are unlikely to be in the mood to celebrate. A shocking year for Spain, 2011 saw unemployment climb close to 23% and yields on sovereign debt break euro-era records. Yet the PP's first year in office could be worse. Joblessness is still rising and growth will be anaemic; Luis de Guindos, the new economic-affairs minister, says that Spain is returning to recession. 
Speaking two months before Spain's general election on November 20th, Mr de Guindos provided a handy list of the country's woes. ""Spain has a big debt problem, a big real-estate problem, a big solvency problem in some financial entities,"" he said. That was not all. ""It has a competitiveness problem and deteriorating public finances. Above all what makes Spain vulnerable is its unemployment."" 
By splitting the finance ministry, Mr Rajoy has separated the two main economic tasks facing Spain. Mr de Guindos must chase growth. Meeting deficit targets falls to Cristobal Montoro, the new minister of the treasury and public administration. 
Mr Rajoy dislikes tax rises. So Mr Montoro will have to squeeze the regional governments, which are responsible for health and education, and where overspending has almost certainly prevented Spain from meeting 2011's budget-deficit target of 6% of GDP, which was agreed on with the European Union. Moody's, a credit-rating agency, believes that the target will be missed by more than one percentage point. Angel Laborda of Funcas, a think-tank, thinks it could be closer to two. 
Every extra percentage point on the deficit means an extra EUR 10 billion ($13 billion) of tightening to meet 2012's deficit target of 4.4%. Even if the 2011 target were met, that would still leave EUR 16.5 billion to be found to stay on track. Reducing the deficit by, say, EUR 30 billion in one year without tax rises looks extremely difficult. By comparison the ""Save Italy"" plan announced by Mario Monti, Italy's new prime minister, amounts to EUR 30 billion spread over three years (although the country has other austerity plans running in parallel). 
Mr Rajoy's first cabinet meeting, on December 23rd, did little more than appoint junior officials. Stronger stuff was expected from the next gathering, on December 30th. Mr Rajoy has already signalled where some savings will be made. The number of publicly owned companies and state foundations will be slashed. Overlapping areas of government administration will be brought into line. There will be a civil-service recruitment freeze. 
But the plan has holes. Much of the public sector, including the police and ""basic services"" (presumably health and education), will be exempt from the freeze. And Mr Rajoy is committed to letting pension payments rise with inflation. 
Happily for him the Socialist opposition is in disarray, squabbling about who will take over the party leadership from Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero, the outgoing prime minister. The initial opposition to Mr Rajoy's government will probably come from the streets, in the form of trade-union and indignado protesters. 
A decade ago a previous PP government, led by Jose Maria Aznar, backtracked on a proposed labour reform after unions organised a general strike. But with a big majority and his party in control of most of the Spanish regions, Mr Rajoy is in a strong position. He knows that the markets and Spain's European partners are watching. He also knows that Spain needs reform, not just austerity. 
Labour reform is the first test. Mr Rajoy has given the unions until mid-January to strike a deal with employers. That is unlikely to happen, so he will use his parliamentary clout to act alone by the end of March. The law needs to become clearer and simpler, especially for small businesses. ""It is still easier to fire people than change their working conditions,"" says Salvador del Rey of the Cuatrecasas International Institute, a labour-law think-tank. ""We need deep change, and then stability."" 
Financial services are another priority. The Spanish banks rescued so far have turned up larger losses than they had previously reported. Mr Rajoy admits that some banks' balance-sheets contain ""latent or hidden losses"". Under new plans soured property assets will have to be sold or priced to market. That will usher in a fresh wave of consolidation. 
Mr de Guindos, formerly of PwC and Lehman Brothers, knows this territory. The problem is not as bad as some believe, he has said, but only transparency will prove him right. The government wants to act fast. Banking reform, Mr Rajoy has pledged, will be done by the summer. 
None of this will count for much if the euro zone goes into meltdown. Soraya Saenz de Santamaria, the new deputy prime minister and a powerhouse in Mr Rajoy's administration, says that her boss will personally oversee economic policy. Much of that work will be done at increasingly frequent summits of euro-zone leaders. Mr Rajoy has already said that Spain's structural budget deficits will be limited to 0.4% of GDP by 2020. That puts Spain ahead of the field in readying itself for the euro zone's coming fiscal treaty.

IN HIS first appearance before parliament last month Mariano Rajoy, Spain's new prime minister, said he had no intention of raising taxes. Only eleven days later, on December 30th, he brought in thumping tax rises on income, savings and property. 
It was the sort of ploy Mr Rajoy's Socialist predecessor, Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero (who preferred indirect taxes), never dared to make, not least because Mr Rajoy's right-wing People's Party (PP) would have accused him of bleeding middle-class wage-earners dry. But in the back-to-front world of budget deficits, principle is often the first casualty. In 2010 Mr Zapatero himself executed a famous U-turn, freezing pensions, raising the retirement age, cutting civil-service pay and imposing austerity on regional governments. 
Mr Rajoy's switch will turn Spain into one of Europe's highest-tax countries. The top income-tax rate will jump by seven points to 52%, although few Spaniards declare an income above the EUR 300,000 ($390,000) threshold. Then there are regional top-ups. Catalonia, for example, will now tax high earners at 56%. In Europe only Sweden has a higher rate. Even those at the bottom of the income scale will see tax rises. Taxes on savings will also go up. And property taxes, paid to town halls, will rise for richer owners. 
When the left cuts benefits and the right raises taxes, something has gone wrong. In this case it is Spain's budget deficit, which missed its 2011 target of 6% of GDP by a mile. Nobody yet knows how bad the overshoot is, but the government says the outcome could be 8% or more (see chart). That would mean Mr Zapatero's government managed barely one-third of the task of cutting it from the 2010 figure of 9.3%. 
Mr Rajoy's government wants to avoid being prodded by bond markets or nagged by Angela Merkel, the German chancellor. But its task is getting harder by the day. The deficit target for 2012, agreed with the European Union, is 4.4% of GDP. Given 2011's missed target that leaves a gap of close to EUR 40 billion to be filled. The new taxes will cover only EUR 6.3 billion of that. Another EUR 8.9 billion will come from spending cuts. But all that accounts for only half the hole. Spain's sales tax--at 18%, low by European standards--may come in for scrutiny. 
Expect more announcements in the coming days, says Cristobal Montoro, the treasury minister. These will include structural reforms to encourage growth. ""The government has an aggressive reform programme,"" says Luis de Guindos, the new finance minister. But the gaping sore of unemployment, at 23% by far the highest in the EU, is likely to worsen before it improves. December saw yet another rise.

Reining in the deficit depends largely on regional governments. The central government says they accounted for most of 2011's overshoot.

IN HIS first appearance before parliament last month Mariano Rajoy, Spain's new prime minister, said he had no intention of raising taxes. Only eleven days later, on December 30th, he brought in thumping tax rises on income, savings and property. 
It was the sort of ploy Mr Rajoy's Socialist predecessor, Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero (who preferred indirect taxes), never dared to make, not least because Mr Rajoy's right-wing People's Party (PP) would have accused him of bleeding middle-class wage-earners dry. But in the back-to-front world of budget deficits, principle is often the first casualty. In 2010 Mr Zapatero himself executed a famous U-turn, freezing pensions, raising the retirement age, cutting civil-service pay and imposing austerity on regional governments. 
Mr Rajoy's switch will turn Spain into one of Europe's highest-tax countries. The top income-tax rate will jump by seven points to 52%, although few Spaniards declare an income above the EUR 300,000 ($390,000) threshold. Then there are regional top-ups. Catalonia, for example, will now tax high earners at 56%. In Europe only Sweden has a higher rate. Even those at the bottom of the income scale will see tax rises. Taxes on savings will also go up. And property taxes, paid to town halls, will rise for richer owners.

""DINNER for one"", a 1963 British comedy sketch barely known in its country of origin, is Germans' favourite television viewing on New Year's Eve. Year after year they delight at the sight of Miss Sophie celebrating her 90th birthday with only her butler, James, for company. He is commanded to follow ""the same procedure as last year"", going around the table impersonating each of the now-dead dinner guests, raising toast after toast and becoming ever more drunk. 
As one awful year for the euro zone made way for another, the German television network ARD digitally retouched the original sketch to create a spoof of European Union summits. Angela Merkel was the bossy dowager. Nicolas Sarkozy was the faithful butler, taking on the roles of departed leaders: George Papandreou of Greece, Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero of Spain and, although he is still in office, David Cameron of Britain. (Italy's Silvio Berlusconi is a tiger-skin carpet on the floor.) The joke was clear: summits are empty charades, only Mrs Merkel matters and Mr Sarkozy is her comical servant. 
The new year will begin rather as the old one ended, with a Merkel-Sarkozy meeting, on January 9th, to prepare the way for yet another EU summit on January 30th. Both sides of the ""Merkozy"" couple started the year trying to outdo the other in gloom. For the French president, this crisis is the worst since the second world war. For the German chancellor, the road to recovery ""remains long and won't be free from setbacks, but at the end of it, Europe will emerge stronger"". For Germany itself 2012 will prove ""more difficult"" than 2011. Even Mr Cameron has seen fit to evoke ""debt storms now battering the euro zone"". 
There is a dose of politicking in all this doom-mongering. Mr Sarkozy wants to tell French voters ahead of this spring's presidential election that only he is up to the task of protecting them in hard times. Mrs Merkel wants to make clear that more pain this year (including for Germany) is not a failure of her politics of austerity but a necessary part of Europe's healing. Mr Cameron wants to blame the euro zone for at least some of Britain's woes. 
None of this is to suggest that the euro crisis is anything other than acute. It may well intensify; indeed, 2012 could see the currency's partial collapse. There are cracks everywhere: Italy has huge amounts of debt to refinance this year; Spain's budget deficit is soaring above its target; France and other AAA-rated countries may be downgraded; Greece is getting worse, not better; European banks remain fragile. The euro zone's much-promised (but inadequate) firewall has not even been created. An incipient recession is making everything much harder. 
Yet the actions of Europe's leaders fail to match their gloomy warnings. Governments and the EU are busily drafting the text of a minor new treaty agreed at December's summit, where Mr Cameron famously cast his veto. Here is a quick reminder. Under pressure from Germany, EU leaders agreed upon a new ""fiscal compact"" to toughen budget rules. They would amend the EU's treaties with two goals: to remove some political discretion in the first step towards subjecting national governments to tighter fiscal monitoring and sanctions; and to enshrine balanced-budget rules in national constitutions, with the European Court of Justice (ECJ) given powers to rule on whether they comply with European guidelines. Britain demanded a partial veto on future financial regulation. When this was rejected, it vetoed the treaty itself. This did not block anything, but it complicates the legal process by forcing the 17 euro-zone members (and most of the euro ""outs"") to draft a text outside the EU treaties. 
The new pact may help prevent a future crisis, but does little to halt the current one. Yet much energy will be wasted in drafting it. Mrs Merkel wants to harden the text with new sanctions for those who ignore ECJ rulings. And she wants ratification of the fiscal compact to be made a condition for countries receiving future bail-outs. That, she hopes, would concentrate the minds of voters in Ireland, were a referendum to be called. 
The French, for their part, want to dress up the treaty as the beginning of a core euro zone, and to extend its scope beyond mere budgetary issues. The European Commission wants to prevent the creation of any rival bodies, and wants the treaty brought back into the EU treaties within five years. The British, despite their veto, have joined the compact as ""observers"" but are laying low for now. Populated as it is by lawyers and diplomats, Brussels loves this kind of wrangling. The idea is to have a draft treaty ready for discussion by leaders at their January 30th summit, with a view to their signing it in March. 
Will the markets be convinced by this? Many want the European Central Bank to buy as many sovereign bonds as it takes to calm markets. That kind of unlimited funding will not happen, although the ECB is providing more money indirectly, in the form of three-year liquidity for banks that may (or may not) use it to buy bonds. It says much about this debate that giving bucketloads of cheap money to banks is seen as preferable to shoring up governments. Just keep talking 
In the absence of the ECB's wall of money, governments are putting up a wall of words. Perhaps they hope that by keeping busy, even on a fairly marginal treaty, they will persuade markets that they are acting decisively. This would be more convincing if they were to include a path, even if only a conditional one, for the mutualisation of at least some euro-zone debt. But joint bonds are unthinkable for Mrs Merkel, at least this side of the German election in 2013. As the ""Dinner for one"" spoof concludes, Merkozy will carry on, ""always without Eurobonds"".

SPAIN'S Socialist Party specialises in nail-biting leadership contests. Its new head, Alfredo Perez Rubalcaba, followed this tradition on February 4th, scraping to victory by just 22 of the 955 votes cast at a convention in Seville. His opponent, Carme Chacon, a 40-year-old female former defence minister, would have made a more striking choice, but it was not to be. 
Mr Rubalcaba is a party veteran who became deputy to Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero just as the prime minister's popularity plummeted in 2010. An aura of defeat already surrounds the 60-year-old. He was the party's candidate for prime minister at November's general election, when Mr Zapatero decided not to run again. The Socialists lost a third of their deputies, their worst result in 35 years, as the People's Party (PP) led by Mariano Rajoy swept to an absolute majority. Mr Rajoy may now stay in power for at least eight years. 
The Socialists' ills extend beyond parliament. They preside over just two of Spain's 17 regional governments and could lose their stronghold of Andalusia to the PP in March. That would be a big blow to Mr Rubalcaba's standing. Today the biggest Socialist-run city is Zaragoza, fifth in size behind the PP-run Madrid, Barcelona, Valencia and Seville. 
How can a man so closely linked to Mr Zapatero's failures expect to win back voters? Mr Rubalcaba's answer is to veer left. He supports bank taxes, looser budgets and less power for the Roman Catholic church. But Spaniards recall him as a member of the government that increased the retirement age, froze pensions, cut civil-service pay and raised sales tax in 2010. He offered not a squeak of complaint then. 
Moreover, Mr Rajoy has stolen some of the Socialists' clothes. He has raised pensions and taxes on high earners, and also capped salaries for bankers who receive state funds. He wants the EU to relax Spain's tough deficit targets. At the behest of France's Nicolas Sarkozy, Mr Rajoy even backs a Tobin tax on financial transactions. Yet unemployment in recession-hit Spain, already running at 23%, could stay high for at least four more years--long enough for voters to start blaming Mr Rajoy. And the PP's determination to reverse some popular Socialist measures, including abortion on demand, may open fresh fronts. 
Mr Rubalcaba is said by some to be preparing for a bruising battle as opposition leader before handing over to a fresh face, who would then take on Mr Rajoy. Potential candidates include the Basque regional premier, Patxi Lopez, and another parliamentary deputy, Eduardo Madina. Ms Chacon is also still an option. Yet Mr Rubalcaba promised to step down after November's election, only to run again. Who is to say he will not want another go? 
That would mean an even longer wait for Spain's first woman leader of a party and potential prime minister. But remember that she might not be a Socialist at all. Look out for Soraya Saenz de Santamaria, Mr Rajoy's impressive deputy, who is the same age as Ms Chacon.",230,Spain,"The new Socialist leader is a chip off the old block--but he may not last

MARIANO RAJOY is an unlikely revolutionary. Spain's new centre-right prime minister has always talked like a typical European austerity hawk. On March 2nd, however, he rebelled. 
Mr Rajoy told Brussels and the rest of the world to forget the budget-deficit target that Spain had agreed to hit this year. Rather than 4.4% of GDP it would aim for a significantly looser 5.8%. The EU could like it or lump it. (Mr Rajoy promised that the 2013 target of 3.0% would still be met.) 
A few weeks ago such an act of defiance might have sparked market turmoil and severe reprimands from Brussels. It could still push the euro zone back to the brink, and the European Commission has threatened reprisals. But for the moment Mr Rajoy has got away with it. Spain's ten-year bond yield remains lower than it was for most of the past year (although it has now overtaken Italy's again). Despite muttering in Brussels and elsewhere, there has been no arm-twisting from the Germans. 
More importantly, Mr Rajoy is sailing in a calmer sea than his Socialist predecessor, Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero, or other prime ministers ousted last year by external pressure, like Italy's Silvio Berlusconi. The euro zone has been flooded with cheap three-year money from the European Central Bank. It has doled out EUR 1 trillion ($1.3 trillion) to banks in two months. Some has gone into Spanish sovereign debt, helping keep yields down. Indeed, there were worries that this liquidity splurge could encourage profligate governments to relax. Mr Rajoy's decision seems to be evidence of this. In fact, the easing of bond-market pressure gives him space to look beyond the short term and tackle Spain's chronic problems of low growth and soaring unemployment. 
To excuse its slippage the government points to Spain's shoddy fiscal performance last year (mostly under Socialist rule). The budget deficit for 2011 was 8.5% of GDP, some way over the EU-agreed target of 6% (see chart). Cutting that to 4.4% this year, amid a recession, would require a ferocious EUR 45 billion adjustment. ""It just wasn't realistic,"" says Jesus Fernandez-Villaverde of the Penn Institute for Economic Research. The Spanish economy could shrink by 1.7% this year, squeezing tax revenues and forcing up benefit costs as unemployment hits 24%. 
Some in Brussels and Berlin suspect the government has exaggerated last year's figures to make its job this year look more difficult. But even the reduced EUR 29 billion adjustment the government will have to make to meet its own target looks tough. Details of how it will be done remain scant: Mr Rajoy is waiting until after regional elections in Andalusia and Asturias later this month to announce a budget. 
Just as Mr Rajoy is set targets, he also sets them. Spain's regional governments are supposed to cut their budget deficits to 1.5% of GDP this year. But their track record is awful. Last year they failed, dismally, to meet a 1.3% limit. Mr Rajoy's People's Party (PP) rules 11 of Spain's 17 regions and may win the two that are up for grabs this month. His word should carry weight. But the regions' past behaviour makes their promises to obey hard to believe. 
Catalonia, run by a Catalan nationalist party, has set a worrying precedent. Last year, in a move that resembles Mr Rajoy's announcement in Brussels, it rebelled against Madrid's targets, declaring that it would aim at a deficit of 2.6% before hitting 1.3% this year. But it turns out that its deficit was 3.7% in 2011.

THEY are licking their wounds in Madrid. With Spain now at the centre of the euro crisis, Nicolas Sarkozy holds it up as an example French voters must avoid. A leading think-tanker is widely quoted saying that Spain is good for flamenco, red wine and nothing else. Even Argentina has joined in, ignoring threats of reprisals to nationalise a Spanish-owned oil company, YPF. As Spain's ten-year bond yields crept over 6% this week, talk of a bail-out for the euro zone's fourth economy is getting louder.

But the government does not believe this justifies all the Spain-bashing. Reforms to banks, the labour market and the budget have all been rushed through in Mr Rajoy's first four months in power. An austerity budget aims at a huge EUR 27 billion cut in the deficit. Regional governments have been told to find EUR 16 billion more: education cuts are to be announced this weekend, health cuts soon afterwards. And the government is threatening to take direct control of some regions' finances. 
""Some people do not seem to realise there has been a change of government,"" complains one official, blaming Spain's tarnished reputation on Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero, whose Socialist government was ousted last November. ""Our political stability is now the envy of Europe."" Other countries, he implies, would love to have four years with an absolute parliamentary majority ahead of them. 
Spanish banks have drawn heavily on the European Central Bank's cheap credit this year. That has helped Spain to raise almost half this year's EUR 86 billion of financing, though the cost has risen. But is this enough? There is growing talk of the European Financial Stability Facility (EFSF) being used to rescue banks loaded with toxic real-estate assets. Cinzia Alcidi and Daniel Gros of the Centre for European Policy Studies see a massive EUR 380 billion property and construction overhang, equivalent to 35% of GDP. Many see a looming bail-out from the ECB, the EU and the IMF. ""Spain is likely to be pushed into a troika programme of some kind during 2012,"" conclude Ebrahim Rahbari and Guillaume Menuet of Citigroup in a recent report. 
Unemployment is 24% and climbing. The budget deficit barely shrank last year, falling from 9.3% to 8.5%, because of overspending regional governments. The target was 6%. And growth is an even bigger concern. This year's adjustment may cut GDP by more than 2%. The IMF has improved its 2012 growth forecasts for most economies, but not for Spain, where GDP is expected to shrink by 1.8% (see chart). And there will be little growth next year. More deficit-cutting will be needed, and the EUR 2.5 billion being raised from a tax amnesty this year will have to be made up for in 2013. 
There are serious doubts, too, about the deficit's future path. Citigroup predicts a 6.6% deficit next year, well above the target. The Bank of Spain's governor, Miguel Angel Fernandez Ordonez, has warned that taxes will have to go up if revenues do not match the forecasts by Cristobal Montoro, the budget minister. 
The budget sees social-security contributions rising and unemployment benefits falling, despite growing unemployment. Mr Montoro left sales tax untouched, let pensions rise and kept civil-service pay static to limit damage to consumer spending. But he may still be forced into a sales-tax increase. And doubts abound about regional governments. Juan Rubio-Ramirez of Duke University doubts if Mr Rajoy has the political will to take on the regions when their budgets are approved in May. Senior officials insist the first intervention by Madrid will come then. That would send a signal that Mr Rajoy means business.

THEY are licking their wounds in Madrid. With Spain now at the centre of the euro crisis, Nicolas Sarkozy holds it up as an example French voters must avoid. A leading think-tanker is widely quoted saying that Spain is good for flamenco, red wine and nothing else. Even Argentina has joined in, ignoring threats of reprisals to nationalise a Spanish-owned oil company, YPF. As Spain's ten-year bond yields crept over 6% this week, talk of a bail-out for the euro zone's fourth economy is getting louder.

2012-06-16,https://www-proquest-com.proxy.uchicago.edu/abicomplete/docview/1020872711/fulltext/3E7149AD2EAD4C43PQ/16?accountid=14657,"The EUR 100 billion pledged to help Spain was meant to rescue the banks and calm the euro zone. Instead it has added to the drama 
IT WAS a victory for the euro. It was a credit line. It was ""the thing that happened yesterday"". The one way Spanish prime minister Mariano Rajoy refused to describe the pledge of EUR 100 billion ($125 billion) from other euro-zone countries to recapitalise Spain's banks was as a ""bail-out"". Nor was it a rescue, the economy minister, Luis de Guindos, insisted; just ""a loan with very favourable conditions"". 
Regardless of the conditions, the outcome was less than favourable. The package had been put together during a series of rushed videoconferences of euro-zone finance ministers on June 9th. The European Commission president, Jose Manuel Barroso, says he pushed Mr Rajoy, who had previously denied the need for any deal, into accepting one. Mr Rajoy has claimed it was he who did the forcing, insisting on a deal focused only on the banks. What is certain is that a need to calm markets before the Greek election on June 17th piled on the pressure. 
The markets were not calmed. By June 12th bond yields were higher than they have been since the country adopted the euro in 1999; if they stay that high for long the kingdom of Spain itself would need a bail-out (see chart 1). Even without government circumlocution, enough was fuzzy about the deal to have investors worried. Yet some things were clear: while Spain now has a plausible plan to recapitalise its banks, the new money does little to resolve the Spanish economy's other fundamental problems. 
Not like the others 
Mr Rajoy's unwillingness to talk of bail-outs stems from a desire not to have Spain spoken of in the same breath as Greece, Ireland and Portugal (see chart 2 on next page). To reassure Spaniards that things were different he insisted that the money came with no strings in terms of new, more austere government policies, just some conditions for the banks. The euro zone's ""men in black"", as the budget minister, Cristobal Montoro, calls them, would not be visiting. 
But on June 11th Germany's finance minister, Wolfgang Schauble, insisted that the troika of lenders--the European Commission, the IMF and the European Central Bank--which administers the bail-outs of Greece, Ireland and Portugal would be heavily involved in Spain too. Euro-zone ministers said Spanish policy, which they endorse, would be scrutinised and ""regularly reviewed"". 
One basis for Spanish exceptionalism is that Spain can be seen as too big to fail. ""There is not enough money to rescue both Spain and Italy,"" says one government official. That allows it to dig in its feet. According to El Mundo, a newspaper, Mr Rajoy reminded Mr de Guindos of this by text during the negotiations: ""Spain is not Uganda. We are the fourth-largest economy in the euro zone."" Officials refused to comment on this claim; wags on Twitter were quick to point out that Uganda's GDP growth and unemployment rate are both far better than Spain's, which is set to see GDP decline by 1.7% this year and suffers 24% unemployment. 
The other basis for exceptionalism is that Spain's crisis is not like those of Greece and Portugal; to begin with, at least, it really was all about the banks. When the global financial crisis hit in 2008, Madrid was relatively calm. Spain's banks were hit, but they had not invested in the toxic off-balance-sheet products that sank banks elsewhere. The then prime minister, Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero, boasted that Spain had ""perhaps the most solid financial system in the world."" 
But though Spain's banks had, as regulators required, made thrifty counter-cyclical provisions, they were also parties to an ungodly property bubble (see chart 3). Property prices tripled between 1995 and 2007. Construction and real-estate loans grew from 10% of GDP in 1992 to 43% in 2009, according to a new IMF report. 
A great deal of the lending was by Spain's unlisted regional savings banks, or cajas. Their share of the financial system, measured in terms of assets, rose from about 10% in the 1960s to nearly half by 2010, increasingly lending outside their region of origin. Fierce competition led to ever more bank branches opening; Spain ended up with one for every 1,000 people, making it one of the most overbanked countries in the world. 
The world's most solid financial system 
After the property bubble popped in 2008, banks began acquiring properties from developers before the loans that supported them went sour. As the economy entered recession, foreclosures mounted. Spain's banks may now own a fifth of the total stock of empty homes, according to some analysts' estimates. 
The reluctance to cut losses has delayed the adjustment in house prices, which have fallen by 25% from the 2007-08 peak, according to various indices. Irish prices, in comparison, have dropped by roughly half. Even though Irish prices rose more in the boom, Morgan Stanley, a bank, reckons that 50% could be on the cards for Spain, too, with the bulk of the remaining correction this year and the next. Supply and demand cannot be matched because the banks own so much property, says Jesus Encinar, founder of Idealista.com, a real-estate portal (see box on next page). ""Banks are only giving mortgages on their own apartments. They will give you a 100% mortgage [but only] if you buy one of their flats."" 
Mr Zapatero had several opportunities to clean up the banking system when government financing costs were lower, but dragged his feet. Spain created its bank bail-out fund, the FROB, in 2009, with a potential capacity of EUR 99 billion; by 2012 it had dispensed only EUR 14 billion. An industry-backed deposit-guarantee fund has provided another EUR 13 billion. 
A key obstacle was that the cajas didn't have shareholders; they were controlled by a mixture of politicians and depositors. Many cajas were operated by regional barons as development banks that could further their political purposes, says Luis Garicano of the London School of Economics. The cajas boasted that they had survived 200 years. Some, such as those in the Basque country, did indeed look healthier than commercial rivals. But the failure of governance at others was of epic proportions. Isabel Cambronero, a professional dancer appointed to the control committee of Caja de Ahorros del Mediterraneo, bailed out and later auctioned, said nobody ever told her there was a crisis. Other ex-board-members tell of meetings in New Delhi and Chicago. Huge pay packages and golden handshakes were the norm. 
The cajas of old are now more or less gone. The advent of FROB and a rise in capital requirements forced the country's 45 savings banks into a frenzy of consolidation. There are now just 11, all set up on modern lines. But these mergers were often fudges that simply compounded the problem. The caja ownership model made it hard to raise capital, and the reordered system reflected that lack. Last summer Bankia, a merger of seven savings banks, and Banca Civica undertook tortured stockmarket listings. A larger rival gobbled up Banca Civica at a discount; Bankia was bailed out on May 26th, its troubles calling into question assumptions about non-performing loans elsewhere in the system and spooking the markets even more. 
The EUR 100 billion loan from the euro zone should head off the sort of panic that might lead to bank runs while enabling the banks to purge their balance sheets of dud loans. But it is doing so by piling even more debt on Spain's weary shoulders. Channelled through the FROB, the loan will count as sovereign debt, potentially adding nearly 10% of GDP to Spain's debt burden this year. At 90% of GDP that burden would still be less than in other highly indebted countries in the euro zone. But markets were also rattled by the possibility that the new loans might take priority over private creditors. The money seems likely to come from the new European Stability Mechanism (ESM), which will be a preferred creditor; that would make Spanish bonds a bit more risky for other creditors. 
The loop of doom 
What is more, the bail-out does not break the feedback loop through which Spain and its banks are making things ever worse for each other. With foreign investors heading for the hills, Spanish banks have stepped in to buy even more government bonds, with the help of the ECB's cheap three-year loan programme. The more foreign investors leave the market--as they seem to have done this week--the less sustainable this becomes. 
The men in black might help with this. Spanish lenders taking bail-out money will be subject to European Union (EU) state-aid rules. Many will be forced to clean up boards and sell stakes in large industrial companies (a welcome development). Mindful of this, some banks were quick to say they did not need the cash. But the IMF report says that only the three largest Spanish banks--BBVA, CaixaBank and Santander, which account for 47% of assets--appear able to cope on their own if things get bad. 
Part of the troika's brief will be what the euro-zone governments call, opaquely, ""horizontal structural reforms"". Judging by the IMF report these might include disentangling the Bank of Spain's regulatory powers from the economy ministry's and strengthening them. The IMF also called for the introduction of a bank-resolution scheme that would impose losses on both shareholders and bondholders. And Joaquin Almunia, the EU's competition commissioner, has said that Spain may need to liquidate one of its bailed-out banks. 
Unlike the governments which oversaw bail-outs in Greece, Ireland and Portugal, all of which were booted out soon thereafter, Mr Rajoy is not in serious political danger. He has an absolute majority in the Cortes, and is only six months into a four-year term. Most of the country still blames Mr Zapatero for the mess. But Mr Rajoy risks increasing Spaniards' alienation. His People's Party has blocked an investigation of Bankia, which was run by managers the party appointed. He looks unlikely to appear in parliament to explain the bail-out until mid-July. And he seems allergic to journalists and their pesky questions. On a recent Senate visit he sneaked out of the back door to avoid them. 
There is a growing feeling, says Josep Lobera of Metroscopia, a polling company, that Mr Rajoy has no real plan for Spain's economy and merely reacts to events by improvising. Spinning ""the thing that happened yesterday"" as a famous victory will only increase that. And the public's faith in Europe is slipping too. Three years ago, 80% thought that the EU could best solve their problems. Three months ago that was down to 65%. Now it is barely over half. 
In Greece, Portugal and Ireland, Spain's ""sweet bail-out"" raised some hackles and some hopes. Portugal's prime minister, Pedro Passos Coelho, warned that he would scrutinise the final deal carefully. Syriza, a left-wing Greek party which wants to tear up the country's current bail-out agreement ( 
) said Spain had shown the way. So did the centre-right: ""Just think, at a time when a country like Spain negotiates, some""--a dig at Syriza--""argue that we have to clash with Europe,"" said Antonis Samaras, the leader of New Democracy. 
Meanwhile the markets swiftly moved on to other vulnerable euro-zone members. Cyprus is reported to be about to ask for a bail-out for its banks, which are heavily exposed to Greece. But the biggest worries are about Italy. Its budget deficit is small and its banks are not troubled by a burst property bubble, but it is in deep recession after a decade of almost no growth and investors are losing faith in the technocratic government of Mario Monti. His reform programme is seen to have stalled and he has less than nine months to go before the next election, the result of which is highly unpredictable. 
Italy's public debt of almost EUR 2 trillion makes it too big for any bail-out; after the latest EUR 100 billion to Spain, the sum left for new lending commitments will be just EUR 400 billion. And the response by the bond markets to that bail-out raises the worry that Spain might need to go back for more. Many of its regions can barely refinance their debts; they are largely to blame for Spain's deficit last year coming in at 8.9% of GDP not the targeted 6%. And while the banks may now be in slightly better shape, they are too risk-averse to lend to companies that, with credit, could grow. ""The tragedy is that these EUR 100 billion won't reach the real economy,"" says Mr Encinar of Idealista.com. ""The banks are petrified,"" agrees MartinVarsavsky, who runs Fon, a Wi-Fi hotspot company. ""They just want to save themselves."" 
That said, Mr Varsavsky sees Spain as highly unlikely to end up in as much trouble as his native Argentina when it defaulted a decade ago. ""Spain is much more mature and understanding of the role others can play in helping,"" he says. ""It is not a defiant, difficult country run by people who are abusive."" But it is still a country in a lot of trouble, likely only to be made worse when the Greek election result at least prolongs, and possibly intensifies, the euro zone's agony. Mr Rajoy may prove wise to have avoided the term ""bail-out"": Spain could be shipping water for some time yet.",230,Spain,"The EUR 100 billion pledged to help Spain was meant to rescue the banks and calm the euro zone.

THE government of Felipe Gonzalez is dying on its feet. Every week seems to bring some new cry of pain. Mr Gonzalez's opponents, in politics and the press, say that he must go. The prime minister, battered and weary, has already been pushed into calling an election next spring, a year before he legally had to. The conservative opposition easily won last summer's city and regional elections; it controls 17 of Spain's 20 biggest cities and won 11 of 13 regional votes. The end of an era is at hand. What went wrong for Mr Gonzalez, and what can the other lot do to put it right?
On the face of it, the answer to the first question seems simple. Spain's establishment is drowning in a sea of corruption. Ever since Mr Gonzalez's long-serving number two, Alfonso Guerra, had to resign in 1991 after a scandal involving his businessman brother, the government has tottered from one embarrassment to the next.
There was the row about illegal financing of the ruling Socialist party. There was the sudden departure from office, amid accusations of tax-evasion and other things, of a governor of the Bank of Spain. A righteous-sounding Socialist, picked to be Spain's first civilian head of the main police force, the Civil Guard, was accused of massive embezzlement and after a ten-month manhunt was tracked down and arrested in comically louche circumstances in Bangkok. Now reports about the financial dealings of the generally popular King Juan Carlos are sharpening the sense of concern.
Most dangerously for Mr Gonzalez, a dozen senior policemen and top Socialists, including a former deputy minister of the interior, have been charged with running death squads that killed at least 27 suspected Basque terrorists in the mid-1980s. Can this have happened without Mr Gonzalez's knowledge? He says he knew nothing. The senate has set up a commission to look into the matter. The Supreme Court has asked for parliamentary immunity to be lifted so that a former interior minister can be charged with collusion in the murders.
Few people think that Mr Gonzalez himself, even if he knew of the death squads' existence, ordered the killing of those Basques (and it should be added that many Spaniards, even on the left, think the dead men got what they deserved). Nor do most people think he himself has been corrupt, though many of his friends clearly were. But Mr Gonzalez was too close to the scandals for his authority to remain undamaged. His subsequent wrigglings have done nothing to repair the damage. The steady piling up of embarrassment has taken its toll. His friends say he may stand down even before the coming election, which is due in March.
How well it all began
That would be a wry end to his 13 years in office, a period longer than any recent European leader can claim except Germany's Helmut Kohl. Whatever his government's recent shortcomings, Spain has experienced a marvellous transformation since Mr Gonzalez became prime minister in 1982.
That was only seven years after the death of General Franco, and one year after an attempted military coup. Yet Mr Gonzalez, a lad of 40 when he assumed that heritage, will leave behind him a solidly democratic Spain. This is now a country that, a few wild-eyed Basques apart, sees elections as the right and proper way of changing governments. Francoism has become a dim memory, and yet there has been little persecution of old Francoists. The army is safely back in barracks. The government of Spain has been desirably decentralised, and the power transferred to the regions has made it harder for Basque terrorists to win new recruits to their anti-Madrid cause.
Not least, Mr Gonzalez's Socialist government has changed the nature of Spanish socialism. Most of the people around him now call themselves Social Democrats rather than Socialists, and say they belong to the ""centre-left"". They have a middle-class feel to them, which is not unconnected to the fact that Mr Gonzalez has been able to win four elections in a row chiefly because much of Spain's burgeoning middle class has so far been happy to vote for him.
In economics, Mr Gonzalez has junked much of the ideological baggage his party carried into office 13 years ago. His has been a truly free-market government-rigorously monetarist, hospitable to foreign investors, firm with the trade unions, gradually willing to privatise, a dutiful slaughterer of quite a few useless industrial dinosaurs. As a result, Spain's GDP has slowly crept up from 71% of the European Union's average in 1983 to 75% in 1994. After a bad recession made worse by carelessness, growth is back to 3% a year and 1995's inflation is likely to be no worse than about 4 1/2%. A recent United Nations report rated Spain ninth in the world for its ""quality of life"". Today's Spaniards live as long as other Europeans, with an average male life-span of 73.
Mr Gonzalez's achievements abroad are no less striking. He swept Spain into the European Community (partly on the argument that membership would help to keep Spain democratic), fought off the opposition of old-guard Socialists to win a referendum that brought the country into NATO, and allowed America to keep its military bases in Spain. Mr Gonzalez has opened Spain to the world. He has made Spain look modern, and helped Spaniards to relax.
So what went wrong?
The fall from those heights is not just the result of a string of. Other things have gone wrong, just as seriously. The Spanish government, rather like Britain's, mismanaged an economic boom in the second half of the 1980s. As the head of the securities and exchange commission puts it, ""Spanish society went a bit crazy in 1986-87. Everybody thought they could become billionaires."" The government failed to keep inflation under control. A lot of flashy firms, having borrowed too much, went bust. As the economy then contracted, unemployment and the public-sector deficit both shot up.
Worse, the economy has a number of structural weaknesses that the government has addressed too timidly, too late or not at all. Spain's labour market is expensively inflexible: firms wanting to shed workers often have to pay them 45 days' compensation for every year they have worked, one of the costliest pay-offs in Europe. As a result, an increasing number of Spaniards-more than a third, say the unions-are now hired on short-term contracts, which they do not like. The Spanish tax system badly needs modernising, but the government has yet to make a start on the job.
The blackest economic cloud hanging over Spain, though, is joblessness. The official figure puts unemployment at 22% of the workforce, the highest in the European Union, way ahead even of Finland's 17%. Even when you allow for people with jobs in the unofficial economy, surveys suggest that about 17% of adult Spaniards have no proper work. The state's generous help for the rural poor reduces the number prepared to go and look for work in the towns, which is anyway pretty hard to find. On any calculation, Spain's performance in this field is the worst in the West.
Nor has this produced the industrial discipline the theorist might have expected. Spain has the EU'S second-worst figure for days lost in strikes, after Greece. There have been angry riots over the closing down of uneconomic shipyards. And the growing economic gloom of the past few years is compounded by the fact that Spain has lately suffered its longest and worst drought in the whole of the century. This has hurt agriculture, which still provides work for a lot of people; and, since Spain is one of those south European countries where city workers like to think they can turn to their country cousins for help when times are hard, it deepens the general demoralisation.
All in all, after a splendid beginning, the Socialists find themselves battered by a series of storms they have not been able to cope with. It is hard to say what Spanish socialism now consists of. The party has adopted practically all the economic doctrines of the European centre, even of the centre-right. Its supporters like to say that theycare more about povertythan the opposition does, that they are more sensitive to the Basque and Catalan desire for a sense of regional identity, that they are a shade ""more European"". All these things may be true, but they are more differences of feeling than of hard policy. It is also true that many Socialists, asked what makes them Socialists, put ""religion"" at the top oftheir list: antipathy to the hierarchy of the Roman Catholic church remains strong. But that is not, in today's Spain, an issue likely to make much difference at the polls.
The original driving-force of Spanish socialism was anti-Francoism. The Socialists of those days were the party of democracy, tolerance, modernity. Now that those things are no longer at issue, Spain's socialism has become a matter of mood. This is why the scandals have so damaged the Socialists. Many Spaniards who came to political maturity in the post-Franco era are shocked by the cynicism the scandals have exposed. ""We Socialists were not supposed to be like that,"" says a literary lioness in Madrid. That is true, and it stings. The shape of the alternative
The Spanish right is now embodied in the People's Party (PP), led by Jose Maria Aznar, himself a relative lad of 42. His party has three main components.
There is the centre-right, which loves to use words like ""pragmatic"" and ""moderate"" about itself, and believes earnestly in consensus, and is in general rather like the more solemn segments of Germany's Christian Democrats. Next comes the residue of the old Francoist right-traditionalist, centralist, nationalistic in the old Castilian way, pro-church, still more than a touch authoritarian. And then there is the new lot, the economic liberals, some of whom call themselves ""Thatcherites"". These people are keen to reduce the size of the state and let the free market rip, zealous in attacking the growing culture of welfare dependency, no believers in boring old consensus.
The consensus-seeking centre-right is the largest single element in this mixture. Most people in Madrid who take an interest in politics reckon that, if the People's Party wins the coming election, the centre-right will try to insist on setting the government's course. This group's main characteristic, judging by what its leaders say, is caution. In the run-up to the election, it will take great care not to frighten voters who have yet to make up their minds.
Last time, Mr Gonzalez scared many
Spaniards into believing that the right intended to turn back the clock, grind the faces of the poor, and so on. The new centre-right stresses the democratic, middle-class mildness that used to be the Socialists' territory. It no longer follows the Roman Catholic church on divorce, abortion and homosexuality. Nor does it champion the merits of a centralised government.
It wants to reassure people on the edges of Spain, not least the large middle class of Catalonia, politically the most important of Spain's regions. ""I prefer the federal structure,"" says a would-be finance minister, rejecting the Castilian right's old fear that Spain's unity could be undermined by breakaway Basques and Catalans. Even an old-guard figure such as Manuel Fraga, a minister under Franco who led the PP'S immediate precursor, the People's Alliance, now espouses the cause of Gallego, the local dialect of Galicia, the region he governs. Many Spaniards doubt that the People's Party has entirely changed its ideas on this subject, but the party's moderates know that the risk of being called a bunch of Castilians is their Achilles heel. They will try hard not to let it bring them to the ground.
These centre-rightists also say they will press on with the economic reforms begun by the modernisers in the Socialist Party; they believe in privatisation, deregulation, monetary rigour. But they are consolidators, not revolutionaries.
It is true that the party's economists say the tax structure should be simplified, and the top rate cut from 56% to 40%. They want contributions to the social welfare budget, currently 28.3% of the basic salary (and almost entirely paid for by employers), cut by 5%. Property, corporation and enterprise taxes should go down, too. Transport, communications, energy and banking need to be more vigorously opened up to competition. The state airline, Iberia, needs a thorough shaking up. Labour should be made more flexible (ie, easier to sack). The number of ministries and the size of their staffs must be cut.
But on each point the spokesmen of the party take care to counsel caution. Changes cannot occur in the first budget. Pensions cannot be reformed ""too soon"". Taxes cannot be reduced, reasonably enough, until there is agreement on how spending can be cut. On a wide range of issues little seems to distinguish the mainstream of the People's Party from the Socialists. Many businessmen, still fond of the corporatist consensus, will not urge a new government towards radicalism of the right. ""Politicians don't want to create panic,"" observes a car maker, approvingly.
On foreign policy, the gap between the parties, says Javier Solana, the foreign minister, is ""zero . . . You need a microscope to see the differences."" Mr Solana admits that the People's Party might be ""a bit more Gaullist"". Certainly it sounds a shade more nationalist in defence of Spanish fishermen, and more determined to protect the country's dairy farmers. It might beat the drum harder on Gibraltar. But on the main issue, the future of the European Union, most of the leading figures in the centre-right section of the party sound little different from the Socialists. The possible next foreign minister, Rafael Arias Salgado, says his party is ""even more enthusiastic about a single currency"". The mystery of Mr Aznar
The centre-right, however, is not in undisputed command of the party. The traditionalist right, composed of the heirs of Franco and the guardians of church-blessed morality, still has a voice. Several would-be ministers, including the shadow justice minister, are said to be members of Opus Dei, a rightwing religious group. Since Spain has no serious, separate party of the far right, these people will stay inside the PP. But they are no longer strong enough to dominate it. Their followers will vote for Mr Aznar, but they will not be able to control him.
A more formidable challenge may come from the Thatcherites. It is hard to measure the size of this group, but its opinions are clear-cut. The Thatcherites have no time for Francoist economics. They want to move fast; the party cannot assume more than one four-year term in power, they say, so it cannot afford to tiptoe into serious reform. On social issues, they are generally libertarian. They are dismissive of what they see as the soggy fudge of German Christian Democracy. They are also wary of the idea of a federal Europe. Several of them are friends of Britain's half-Castilian minister of defence, Michael Portillo, an ardent Eurosceptic.
Another sign of vitality in the People's Party is its new openness to women and the young. The shadow ministers of agriculture, education and social security are all women. So are the PP mayors of Seville, Valencia, Saragossa and Malaga. Mr Aznar's wife is a power in the party.
No less important is the relative youth of many of the party's leading figures. A dozen years ago it was Mr Gonzalez who epitomised young, modern Spain. Now the Socialists' core constituency consists of the rural poor and nervous pensioners. The impatient young have swung to the right. This has had its effect on policy. The PP is readier than the Socialists to cut the length of time young conscripts have to spend in the armed forces; it might even abolish conscription altogether, and give Spain a small professional army instead. It is at least as interested as Mr Gonzalez's party in the environment, another thing that youth cares about. The Socialists have begun to look more conservative than the people who want to replace them.
Which strand of the PP will prevail if the party wins power? The conventional wisdom in Madrid has it that the apparently dull and cautious Mr Aznar, solidly unspectacular when he was head of the province of Castile-Leon before taking over the party leadership, is a natural consensus man. After the glitter of Mr Gonzalez, say many, Spain needs this unphotogenic, seemingly boring tax lawyer.
Mr Aznar is still a bit of a mystery. He has gained in confidence lately. His calmness and dignity after Basque terrorists narrowly failed to blow him up in Madrid last April were widely applauded. But he still keeps his cards close to his chest, though he has written (apparently without much ghosting) a respectable outline of his beliefs which suggests that he has been doing a commendable amount of reading of Karl Popper, David Hume and others. The battle for his mind continues.
Two big questions remain. One is about Spain's ""nationalities"": how, essentially, Mr Aznar proposes to deal with the Catalans and the Basques. If he fails to win an outright majority of seats in the next parliament, as is entirely possible, he will have to decide whether he wishes to buy the support of those regions' parties with a further devolution of power from Madrid.
The even bigger question concerns the economy. Although the People's Party has lately sounded so studiously moderate, Mr Aznar may decide that the economy's structural problems-with its tax system, the labour market, welfare, pensions, the banksare so severe that only brave and radical action as soon as he gets into office will have a chance of solving them. The Thatcherites think he is more attracted to their ideas than he lets on, and that he might become more adventurous once in power. ""I am a liberal, not a Thatcherite,"" he has said. ""Wait and see,"" the Hispano-Thatcherites retort.
The more cautious people in his party say that, if he is converted to radicalism, Mr Aznar will be taking a risk with Spain's newborn democracy, still too frail to stand the shock of drastic economic reform. The irony is that, if Mr Aznar decides to ignore these nervous colleagues, it will be because of what he inherits from Mr Gonzalez. his 13 years, Mr Gonzalez has overseen Spain's transformation into a firmly-rooted democracy that might, in fact, accept the painful measures which Spain needs at least as much as does the rest of Western Europe.
Post-Franco Spain has been, on the whole, a remarkable success. But it has not removed all the weaknesses of the Franco times, and Mr Gonzalez's Socialists have been in power long enough to have produced new flaws of their own. Spain needs something livelier, post-Gonzalez, than just a dutiful preserver of things as they are.","After 13 years in power , Spain 's Socialists are almost certainly heading for the exit .

It is at least as interested as Jose Maria Aznar's party in the environment , another thing that youth cares about . The Socialists have begun to look more conservative than the people who want to replace them . 
 Which strand of the PP will prevail if the party wins power ? The conventional wisdom in Madrid has it that Jose Maria Aznar party leadership , is a natural consensus man . After the glitter of Jose Maria Aznar , say many , Spain needs Jose Maria Aznar . 
 Jose Maria Aznar is still a bit of a mystery . Jose Maria Aznar has gained in confidence lately . Jose Maria Aznar's calmness and dignity after Basque terrorists narrowly failed to blow Jose Maria Aznar up in Madrid last April were widely applauded . But Jose Maria Aznar still keeps Jose Maria Aznar's cards close to Jose Maria Aznar's chest , though Jose Maria Aznar has written ( apparently without much ghosting ) a respectable outline of Jose Maria Aznar's beliefs which suggests that Jose Maria Aznar has been doing a commendable amount of reading of Karl Popper , David Hume and others . The battle for Jose Maria Aznar's mind continues . 
 Two big questions remain . One is about Spain 's "" nationalities "" : how , essentially , Jose Maria Aznar proposes to deal with the Catalans and the Basques . If Jose Maria Aznar fails to win an outright majority of seats in the next parliament , as is entirely possible , Jose Maria Aznar will have to decide whether Jose Maria Aznar wishes to buy the support of those regions ' parties with a further devolution of power from Madrid . 
 The even bigger question concerns the economy . Although the People 's Party has lately sounded so studiously moderate , Jose Maria Aznar may decide that the economy 's structural problems - with its tax system , the labour market , welfare , pensions , the banksare so severe that only brave and radical action as soon as Jose Maria Aznar gets into office will have a chance of solving them . The Thatcherites think Jose Maria Aznar is more attracted to their ideas than Jose Maria Aznar lets on , and that Jose Maria Aznar might become more adventurous once in power . "" Jose Maria Aznar am a liberal , not a Thatcherite , "" Jose Maria Aznar has said . "" Wait and see , "" the Hispano - Thatcherites retort . 
 The more cautious people in Jose Maria Aznar's party say that , if Jose Maria Aznar is converted to radicalism , Jose Maria Aznar will be taking a risk with Spain 's newborn democracy , still too frail to stand the shock of drastic economic reform . The irony is that , if Jose Maria Aznar decides to ignore these nervous colleagues , it will be because of what Jose Maria Aznar inherits from Jose Maria Aznar . Jose Maria Aznar's 13 years , Jose Maria Aznar has overseen Spain 's transformation into a firmly - rooted democracy that might , in fact , accept the painful measures which Spain needs at least as much as does the rest of Western Europe . 
 Post - Franco Spain has been , on the whole , a remarkable success . But it has not removed all the weaknesses of the Franco times , and Jose Maria Aznar's Socialists have been in power long enough to have produced new flaws of their own . Spain needs something livelier , Jose Maria Aznar , than just a dutiful preserver of things as they are .",230,Spain,A29-4231,PRE TERM,True,"Jose Maria Aznar , himself a relative lad of 42",83,True

At last month's congress of his centre-right People's Party, 99.5% of those attending endorsed him as leader. Opinion polls give his PP a fairly comfortable six-to-ten percentage-point lead over the ruling Socialists. And on March 3rd, when Spain has a general election, he is fancied to break the Socialists' 13-year hold on power and become the first full-blooded conservative leader since Generalissimo Franco died in 1975.
But Mr Aznar should not count his chickens. He has been beaten twice by Felipe Gonzalez, who has been prime minister for 13 years and remains a formidable campaigner. And Mr Aznar still wants to show that he can do more than ride to power on a wave of Socialist unpopularity: he wants to win the arguments. If, as is possible, he fails to win an outright majority in parliament, his government will be hobbled by the need to bargain with regional parties from Catalonia and perhaps the Basque country. And even with a handsome majority, it is unclear how radical he would dare to be.
He has promised austerity, an end to corruption and the start of what he calls Spain's ""second transition"" (the first was the move to democracy in the first postFranco years). ""Spain has had enough charisma,"" he says, referring to Mr Gonzalez. So he must hope: a former tax inspector, Mr Aznar hides his charisma well. But young and middle-class voters seem to like him.
On social issues, he does not sound very different from the Socialists, though some Spaniards fear that the PP's traditionalists, spurred on by the Opus Dei religious group, might press for restrictions on abortion and more religious instruction in schools. One of Mr Aznar's achievements, so far, is to have welded together Christian Democrats, economic liberals and the remnants of Spain's autocratic right into a moderate, modern-European centre-right. But he has done so by imposing strict control within his party-at the cost of stifling debate. If Mr Aznar wins, differences within could burst into the open.
A future Aznar-led cabinet might, for instance, contain a foreign minister who favours European federalism and a finance minister sceptical of European monetary union. But the argument most likely to break out soonest is over how to tackle Spain's economy. The markets may punish Mr Aznar if, within three months or so of coming to power, he fails to cut spending, make labour markets more flexible and open up protected sectors such as energy, transport and telecoms.
Not so easy. Spain's economy grew last year by around 3%, but it meets none of the criteria laid down in the Maastricht treaty. So far Mr Aznar implausibly insists that Spain can still meet them on time, by reducing the budget deficit from its current 5.9% of GDP to 3% by 1999 without undermining Spain's welfare state. The PP's probable economic supremo, Rodrigo Rato, says that the top rate of income tax can eventually be cut from 56% to 40% by making sure that tax dodgers, especially rich ones, pay up. He would also bring down employers' taxes but says that a PP government would not touch pensions. Social-service spending would simply grow more slowly.
Mr Aznar is still clutching most of his cards tightly to his chest. He knows that Spain has become used to consensus and still shudders at the memory of civil war. So he has promised to consult Spain's labour unions and employers as soon as he is elected. The unions, which have organised four general strikes against Mr Gonzalez's tentative steps towards economic liberalisation, are becoming a bit more realistic. But Mr Aznar needs courage if he is to dish out the medicine Spain can no longer avoid.

With less than a month before a general election, friends who have sailed along with the Socialist helmsman for the past 13 years seem to be abandoning him one by one.
First to dive overboard was Emilio Botin, head of the Bank of Santander (Spain's biggest), who says he is backing Jose Maria Aznar and the conservative opposition People's Party (PP). Next, Jose Maria Cuevas, head of the employers' association and another erstwhile ally of Mr Gonzalez, followed suit. Then, almost as unkindly, his old friend and former finance minister, Miguel Boyer, went slap against Socialist policy by daring to suggest that joining Europe's monetary union in 1999 is not such a brilliant idea after all.
Such rattery is unsurprising. The Socialist ship is sinking in the opinion polls. Some party members even think it might be better to lose this election, pick a new leader with new policies, and come roaring back in four years' time.

The party's decision to field a former interior minister as a candidate even though he has been formally accused of overseeing secret death squads against suspected Basque terrorists in the 1980s has caused gasps of outrage.
Yet, for all their troubles, the Socialists would still be in with a chance-if only the left were at one. Spain's political centre of gravity seems to remain a shade to the left of centre. Unfortunately for Mr Gonzalez, the leftish vote is split between his Socialists and the United Left (mainly former communists, who are likely to win about a tenth of the vote). Mr Aznar is more fortunate: virtually every Spaniard to the right of centre is behind his PP.
Mr Gonzalez's main pitch is that he is an international statesman, whereas Mr Aznar, 11 years his junior and with only a brief spell as a provincial leader to his name, is green in the ways of the world. ""European leaders are terrified of Aznar appearing at [an EU Council of Ministers] meeting,"" he warned an audience in Seville.
Mr Gonzalez's main problem is that he has nothing much new to offer, except to defend his record in office-which is patchy. For sure, he can argue that over the past 13 years he has modernised much of Spain, consolidated membership of the European Union and created a welfare state which might be threatened by the PP's promised greater austerity. After the recession hit rockbottom in 1993, the economy has started to grow again, with output rising at about 3% last year.
But to an increasing number of young Spaniards, the Socialists are the dinosaurs of pol itics-ageing, corrupt, and reluctant to tackle big issues, such as the future of the EU. Mr Gonzalez is certainly getting little help from Julio Anguita, the United Left leader, who is hostile to the European idea and sounds as keen as Mr Aznar is to eject the Socialists from power.
As in 1993, Mr Gonzalez is banking, in the end, on fear to drive voters back into his arms. He is playing on worries that rightwing authoritarians in the PP might roll back 13 years of modernisation and even try to undo some of the decentralising reforms which have gone far to assuage sentiment in Spain's regions, especially among the Catalans and Basques.
Such scare tactics helped win.him the previous election. But this time they may contrast poorly with Mr Aznar's pledge to run a clean campaign-and will seem all the dirtier because Mr Gonzalez's enemies in the media and business world have so helpfully been airing all the scandals that have damaged the Socialists.","FELIPE GONZALEZ , Spain 's struggling prime minister , is miffed .

Now, with the conservative People's Party, led by Jose Maria Aznar, looking set to win the general election on March 3rd, that may change. The PP's campaign slogan, ""the New Majority"", underlines its eagerness to govern alone. That would mean a weaker voice for Spain's regions.
 In any event, Xabier Arzallus, the brash and awkward leader of the Basque National Party, the region's biggest, says he could never work with the PP. Catalonia's boss, the much cannier Jordi Pujol, says many aspects of PP policy ""frighten"" him. Both men are wary of the Spanish right's traditional tendency to concentrate power at the Castilian centre. They also fear a more sceptical attitude to Europe: they, especially Mr Pujol, have cleverly solicited European help for their regions and have even hinted at switching allegiance one day from Madrid to Brussels.
Yet as opinion polls suggest that the PP is gathering pace, both Basques and Catalans have begun to sound more cautious, tacitly acknowledging that the PP is unlikely to snatch back concessions already granted, and that they could probably come to an understanding. Mr Gonzalez's assurance that he will not, if the PP wins most votes, deprive it of power by ganging up with regional parties has helped make them less extravagant in their claims.
A PP government would not, in any event, be all that hostile to the regions. For sure, it might call a halt to the devolution that began after Franco's death in 1975 as part of Spain's transition to democracy. But it would not try to roll it back. It would also try to set in motion an all-party agreement to make Spain's 17 regional governments more responsible for their own public services. It might be less easy-going about Basque and Catalan attempts to promote their languages. And it sounds a bit tougher on terrorism. But that's about it.
Basques are different from Catalans. They tend to be more emotional and romantic and fundamentalist in their nationalism, whereas Catalans are more cautious and money-minded and pragmatic. Mr Arzallus and Mr Pujol typify that contrast. A more striking difference, of course, is that a lot of Basques-about 15% in the last election-back a party that endorses ETA, the Basque terrorist movement, which showed its teeth again this week by shooting dead a former head of Spain's Constitutional Court in his Madrid office. Catalans demanding outright independence eschew violence and are proportionately fewer.
But even in the Basque country, regional fervour may be waning. Both there and in Catalonia the PP may make inroads. In both places some prominent businessmen, who have had enough of nationalist zealotry, are backing it. Mr Pujol may lose a seat or two to the PP from the 17 he holds in the 350-seat parliament in Madrid.
The PP has another regional bonus. Some of the smaller regional parties are befriending it. The Aragon nationalists are now campaigning on one ticket with the PP, and the Valencians have also declared their support. The Canary Islanders, however, still stand alone, hoping to bargain for more power for their archipelago.
On one issue, though, Mr Aznar is set to be more robust towards the nationalists than Mr Gonzalez was. Should the PP win the most votes but fail to secure an outright majority, he will insist that the nationalists join a full-blooded coalition. Over the past three years Mr Pujol has been able to tweak and prod Mr Gonzalez by giving him ""informal backing"" without ever actually joining him in government Not good enough, Mr Aznar will say, if he lacks an outright majority: join our government or keep out, but do not try to pull strings from somewhere in-between.","SINCE Felipe Gonzalez 's Socialists lost their outright majority in parliament three years ago , the Basques and Catalans have got used to pulling a lot of strings in Madrid .

FOR two decades Spain has been one of Europe's stirring success stories. The transition to democratic government, after the death in 1975 of dour Generalissimo Franco, went smoothly enough. Half a century after a bloody civil war and 15 years after an attempted military coup, Spain has a solid democracy and an economy that, with vigorous pruning, could be sturdy enough to meet the challenges ahead. For this, Felipe Gonzalez, reigning Socialist prime minister for 13 years but likely loser in the general election on March 3rd, deserves much credit. How could Spain manage without him?
Under Mr Gonzalez's guidance, the Socialists tossed away the past and reinvented themselves as free-market social democrats. Inward-looking, suspicious, austere Spain became outgoing, cosmopolitan and relaxed. It joined what is now the European Union and NATo. At home, the power of the old Castilian centre has sensibly been curbed. The outer regions, most importantly Catalonia and the Basque country, have been given enough autonomy to satisfy all but the most fanatical of separatists. Class-warring egalitarians on the left and corporatists on the right have been marginalised. Some of this had begun before Mr Gonzalez won power. But he deserves thanks for seeing it through.
That said, however, his government has long been dying on its feet. A string of scandals has brought to light massive corruption and worse. A former interior minister is accused of overseeing death squads that killed more than a score of suspected Basque terrorists-several of whom turned out to be innocent. Mr Gonzalez has lost the nation's trust, not because he is thought to be mired personally, but because he has seemed negligent towards the wrongdoing of his cronies.
Meanwhile, Mr Gonzalez's many achievements have been increasingly overshadowed by his failure to tackle the deeper structural problems of Spain's economy. Although some figures do not look too bad-after a fierce recession in the early i99os, growth is back to about 3% a year and inflation is down to 4%-Spain has the highest unemployment rate in Europe and a welfare and pensions system that consumes an ever growing proportion of its budget. If the next government is to tackle all that, and stay within shouting distance of the criteria for joining a future European economic and monetary union, then privatisation and deregulation need to be speeded up, stifling labour laws need to be axed and the mess which masquerades as Spain's tax system has to be sorted out.
But Mr Gonzalez and his government are clean out of ideas. If opinion polls are to be believed, their time is now up (see page 52). Certainly, Spain could use a less winded leader, a new government, and a fresh spirit of reform.
Spain's likely next prime minister,Jose Maria Aznar, who leads the People's Party, lacks anything like the Gonzalez charisma. A strikingly unflashy former tax inspector, his very ordinariness has helped convince Spaniards that his party has exorcised both its anti-democratic, Francoist past and the old Castilian authoritarianism. If Mr Gonzalez recreated the Socialists as a party of the centre-left, Mr Aznar's party now smells rosily of the moderate, pragmatic centre-right.
Will Aznar do better?
But there, for Mr Aznar and for Spain, is the rub. The right may be about to wrest power from Mr Gonzalez's weakened Socialists because it is no longer frightening. In the long run, however, that is not enough. In the past year or so, as the Socialists have destroyed themselves, Mr Aznar has cannily held his economic cards close to his chest. But if he is to succeed as Spain's prime minister over the next four years, he will need to find the steel to push through radical measures which, in the short run at least, will cause Spaniards even more economic pain than many of them already feel. And if he can do that, can Spain, its social fabric already stretched by unemployment and economic uncertainty, take it? Again, it is much to Mr Gonzalez's credit that Spain probably can.","A strong democracy , Spain now needs a reformed economy

 Jose Maria Aznar's , lacks anything like the Gonzalez charisma . A strikingly unflashy former tax inspector , Jose Maria Aznar's very ordinariness has helped convince Spaniards that Jose Maria Aznar's party has exorcised both its anti - democratic , Francoist past and the old Castilian authoritarianism . If Mr Gonzalez recreated the Socialists as a party of the centre - left , Jose Maria Aznar's party now smells rosily of the moderate , pragmatic centre - right . 
 Will Jose Maria Aznar do better ? 
 But there , for Jose Maria Aznar and for Spain , is the rub . The right may be about to wrest power from Mr Gonzalez 's weakened Socialists because it is no longer frightening . In the long run , however , that is not enough . In the past year or so , as the Socialists have destroyed themselves , Jose Maria Aznar has cannily held Jose Maria Aznar's economic cards close to Jose Maria Aznar's chest . But if Jose Maria Aznar is to succeed as Spain 's prime minister over the next four years , Jose Maria Aznar will need to find the steel to push through radical measures which , in the short run at least , will cause Spaniards even more economic pain than many of them already feel . And if Jose Maria Aznar can do that , can Spain , its social fabric already stretched by unemployment and economic uncertainty , take it ? Again , it is much to Mr Gonzalez 's credit that Spain probably can .",230,Spain,A29-4231,PRE TERM,True,"Spain 's likely next prime minister , Jose Maria Aznar , who leads the People 's Party",12,True

Not only do opinion polls suggest he will lose a general election on that day to the conservative People's Party (rr), led by Jose Maria Aznar, but his Socialists may even get shunted into second place in the regional parliament of his backyard, the once impregnable Socialist fief of Andalusia. After more than 13 years in power, Mr Gonzalez has lost his charisma and his political touch.
Felipe, as he is universally known in Andalusia, has tried to look after his own, investing more than 1,000 billion pesetas ($8 billion) in infrastructure there since he came to power in Madrid. Yet unemployment, at a full third of the workforce, is 10% higher than the official figure in Spain as a whole. Meanwhile the once-solid Socialist vote is splitting, as it is elsewhere in Spain: old people, unemployed and rural folk, nervous that a conservative government might cut welfare, remain stubbornly loyal. But the young and the goahead, especially in towns, are thirsting for change.
Throughout the general election campaign Mr Gonzalez has put in a defensive, lacklustre performance. His heart is not in it. He has been demoralised by the assassination of two close allies during the campaign. His panache on the hustings has always been the Socialists' trump card. Yet this time he has been heavily criticised for promoting a campaign video which crudely depicts the PP as fascist-style oppressors. The Socialists could be pulled further down by a good showing from the United Left, mainly former communists, who won 9.6% last time round, in 1993.
By contrast, the increasingly confident Mr Aznar, who has doggedly presented his party as middle-of-the-road, comes across as intense, clean and efficient. If opinion polls are to be believed, he might win an outright majority in parliament, thus relieving him of the need to bargain with Catalan and other regional parties.
The economy has been foremost in most voters' minds. Having watched the rough ride given in recent months to Alain Juppe, France's prime minister, in his attempt to introduce welfare reform, Mr Aznar has promised not to launch a similar wholesale attack on Spain's equally bloated system. He says he will not touch pensions. An array of other benefits will, he says, be safe. Instead, if elected, he will immediately ""consult"" trade unions and employers. ""Social cohesion is guaranteed,"" he told an audience of Catalan businessmen.
Still, if Spain is to meet the criteria for economic and monetary union set out in the Maastricht treaty, as prime minister Mr Aznar would have to try to halve the budget deficit, currently 5.9% of GDP, over the next three years and bring down inflation. He would also need to kill or sell off more of Spain's state industries, a left-over of Francoist corporatism and protectionism, and reform the country's labour laws. Meanwhile Mr Aznar promises tax cuts, arguing unconvincingly that he can find the revenue largely by making government ""more efficient"". And all this, while somehow reducing unemployment .
Privately, Mr Aznar knows that these hopeful assurances do not add up. If he wins the election, expect him to declare that the situation is even worse than he had realised. With a four-year mandate ahead of him, the period straight after the election would be the best moment to start dishing out the nastiest medicine. But he will need a lot of nerve.
Nor is it really clear where Mr Aznar stands on Europe. On the whole, the conservatives have sounded as keen as the Socialists to be ""good Europeans"". Mr Aznar pays lip-service to the current timetable for economic and monetary union by 1999. Once in office, he may well prove more sceptical. He has already accused Mr Gonzalez of being too keen on European integration, at a cost to national pride and interests. He would probably like the Maastricht timetable to be slowed down. And he is irritated bywhat he senses to be tacit support for Mr Gonzalez from Helmut Kohl, the German chancellor.
Terrorism has also become a campaign issue. The Basque terrorist group, ETA, currently holds two kidnap victims and has carried out two assassinations in the past fortnight. If the conservatives win, the terror could increase. Mr Aznar has made it plain he wants to govern without Catalan and Basque nationalist support. That has hurt regional sensibilities-and could even revive support for terror on the Basque nationalist fringe. With ETA under the command of new, young and relentlessly violent leaders, the chances of a conservative government being able to win a negotiated settlement are zero. Yet Mr Aznar might shrewdly hope to quell unease by tapping a respected Basque as his interior minister.
As for the non-violent Basque and Catalan parties, a victorious Mr Aznar might be urged to offer them a pact (though not a place in government) along the lines of the one he says he will offer to the trade unions and employers. He is unlikely to want to start off in government with both the centre-left and the nationalists lined up against him. But tactics is one thing, backbone another. If he is to govern Spain well, Mr Aznar will need both.","Jose Maria Aznar may be hit by a double blow on March 3rd .

AN ERA may have ended. Spain's Socialists, for the time being, are out. But the heralded new dawn of conservatism, let alone radical conservatism, is not at hand. Worse for Spain, the country may now enter a period of weak and wishy-washy government, with parties and factions vying for advantage, terrorists and regionalists stirring the pot, and no person and no new set of ideas emerging as the dynamo for rejuvenating the country. Once again, a Spanish prime minister at the head of the largest party is likely to be yanked this way and that by a canny provincial boss concerned more with the fate of Catalonia than the fate of Spain. The likeliest outcome: fuzziness and drift. Spain, as a result of the election on March 3rd, has lost.
Numerically, there was indeed a winner. Jose Maria Aznar and his conservative People's Party won 38.9% of the votes and 156 seats against Felipe Gonzalez and his Socialists, who took 37.5% of the vote and 141 seats. That was victory, of a kind, for the right. It was, after all, the first time in Spanish history that straightforward conservatives (as opposed to the technocrats who ruled Spain in the immediate transition to democracy after General Franco's death in 1975) had ever been freely elected.
But it was a big disappointment for Mr Aznar, who, had the opinion polls been right, would have won an outright majority in the Cortes's 350-seat lower house. Instead, he fell 20 seats short. The margin of Mr Aznar's victory was so narrow that he has immediately been sucked into the messy business of deal-making with the cleverest horse-trader in Spanish politics: Jordi Pujol, who has run Catalonia for nearly two decades and whose 16 seats could, if he wanted, deprive Mr Aznar of the vote of confidence he will need to form a government.
Even those Catalan seats might not be enough to enable Mr Aznar to govern. He also needs a clutch of Canary Islanders to keep him going. If they do not co-operate, there are a handful of moderate Basques, a couple of Galicians and a lone Valencian to be kept in play.
In theory, Mr Gonzalez could still try to cobble together a coalition of his own (though he and the mainly ex-communist United Left, which won 10.6% of the vote and 21 seats, have sworn not to canoodle with each other), which could deny Mr Aznar his working majority and even present itself as a ruling alternative. In fact, Mr Gonzalez seems to have accepted the people's dismissal. Now his most likely aim is to watch Mr Aznar from the sidelines, chuckling as the new man ties himself in knots trying against the odds to run a coherent government.
The key, though, is once again Mr Pujol. After Mr Gonzalez won the 1993 election without securing an outright majority, the Catalan leader made a pact with him, whereby Mr Pujol propped up the minority government but refused to form a coalition. Then, as the corruption and other scandals plaguing the Socialists got out of hand, Mr Pujol felt obliged to withdraw his support altogether. Mr Aznar is now looking glumly at a similar deal. Mr Pujol will make him sweat. Mr Aznar could look bedraggled before he has even entered the prime minister's palace.
In economics, he and the businessminded Mr Pujol can probably come to terms, though he is less likely to back radical policies for which he would then have to share the inevitable unpopularity, at least in the short term. On constitutional matters, however, co-operation between Mr Aznar and Mr Pujol will be even trickier. The Catalan is bound to seek ever greater concessions for his fief, in such matters as revenue raising. Mr Aznar is already offering to bargain over tax. Yet his Castilian core constituency already thinks the regionalists have been getting so much autonomy that the fabric of the Spanish state is threatened.
The poker could go on for weeks. King Juan Carlos, who has a delicate job on his hands, will give Mr Aznar about a month to find enough votes to give him an absolute majority of the whole of the lower house of the Cortes needed to install a new government. Failing that, a second vote within a few days, with a majority merely of those voting, would be enough to endorse a new government. The Catalans might abstain, allowing Mr Aznar to form a government, but a limp one.
The puzzle of the election is why Mr Gonzalez, with unemployment officially stuck at 23% and his government mired in corruption, did as well as he did. The result, in the end, testifies to Mr Gonzalez's enduring appeal to those in the bottom half of the Spanish pile. Despite the shakiness of its economy, the Socialists even managed to win a regional election in Mr Gonzalez's backyard, Andalusia. With left-wing parties still corralling more than half the vote nationwide, the heart of Spain still, it seems, beats a shade to the left of centre.
And why did Mr Aznar not do better? Many Spaniards were evidently not reassured by his protestations that the new Spanish right has exorcised the ghosts of the authoritarian past. The rural poor and the elderly were worried that the right might cut welfare. Many people in the outlying regions, especially Basques and Catalans, still suspect that the right wants to shut them up. Despite the rise of a middleof-the-road urban middle class, perhaps Spain is still more a country of two nations than commentators in Madrid had cared to admit.
The upshot is threefold. Spain's new government is likely to be weak. Radical reform is likely to be postponed. And Spain will miss an early chance to shape up as a competitive country in 21st-century Europe. A new election, perhaps within the year, might be a way out, though it might produce the same result. Meanwhile, politicians in Madrid are already muttering darkly about the ""Italianisation of Spanish politics"".

Tory commentators of course prefer the former interpretation. Anti-Tories prefer the latter. You pays your money and you takes your choice.
 Or, rather, if you have your wits about you, you don't pay and you don't choose. Analogies between one political system and another are notoriously flakey. What is true of one election often turns out not to be true of the next.
Nor is it likely that there is a direct causal relationship between elections in one country and those in another. The notion that some mysterious force will move voters in Manchester to ape voters in Melbourne or Madrid does not bear close examination.
In the long run, admittedly, certain broad international forces do shape politics in individual countries. For example, the increasing pace of globalisation has posed serious problems for Keynesian social democrats in Europe and beyond, moving them to recast their traditional reflationary policies. Communism has not been the same since the Berlin Wall came down. In years to come, job insecurity may create similar problems for unreconstructed New Right parties.
These factors matter, but they are not the ones that decide British elections. In Britain, most elections are ephemeral affairs. Voters, who are not on the whole great internationalists, cast their ballots depending on local circumstances: the pound in their pocket, the characters of the candidates and the competence of the government of the day.
Moreover, those who like to link election results in one country and those in another must deal with an awkward fact. In modern democracies, elections are not decided by the best-informed voters. Such voters, having decided their general disposition, tend to stick to one party through thick and thin.
Elections are decided by swing electors. Swing electors drift hither and thither. Sometimes they vote. Sometimes they abstain (though not in Australia, where voting remains compulsory). In Britain in particular they tend not to move between the two big parties but to sidle from Labour or Tory to Lib Dem, or from Lib Dem to Labour or Tory, as the spirit moves them. British elections are mostly decided by those who know little about politics and care less. Such voters, whose knowledge of Australia is gleaned from soap operas and of Spain from the Costa Brava, will not be moved by last weekend's results.
All that chatter, all those carefully crafted columns, all that informed speculation and considered judgment-all this then is for nothing? Indeed: if you want to use these elections as predictors of the next British general election, they are. Nevertheless, Mr Blair in particular among British political leaders could learn some useful lessons from Australian and Spanish politics. They do not concern strategy, still less ideology, but tactics.
The first lesson is how to deport yourself in opposition. Here the model is Australia-not its latest election, however, but the election of 1993.
This was an election that the ruling Labor Party could not win. Australians, wrote Russel Ward, a pro-Labor historian in 1992, ""were tired of the same old faces in the Canberra opera-bouffe. They wanted a new cast."" The LiberalNational coalition held commanding opinion-poll leads.
Mr Ward reckoned without the suicidal honesty of John Hewson, then the coalition's leader. Mr Hewson came under the influence of the radical right. He announced a 15% value-added tax, to pay for big cuts in personal taxes.
In substance, the proposal had merit. But by making it he ensured that he would never get the chance to put it into practice. Voters were scared. Paul Keating, the Labor leader, took him to the cleaners. Lesson learned:John Howard, the coalition's leader, fought his successful campaign saying as little as possible about tax. The lesson is not likely to be lost on Mr Blair.
The second lesson for Mr Blair is not about this election either, but about the elections he will face in five and ten years' time if he wins. It is this: cultivate allies. Look after them in good times as well as in bad. You never know when you will need them.
Felipe Gonzalez,the Socialist leader in Spain, may soon reap the benefit from understanding that. Early on, his party ruled alone. But more recently he established alliances with smaller regional parties. He became, as Mr Blair says he is, a decentralist, devolving power, as Mr Blair says he will, to his country's regions, according to their individual circumstances.
Mr Gonzalez, stale in office, looked like losing heavily last Sunday. In fact, he lost only narrowly. The conservative victor, Jose Maria Aznar, who hoped for victory without allies, now has to scramble for support from parties he has neglected.
As in Spain, so in Britain. As things stand, Mr Blair looks set to win an overall majority. But his project is one for ten or 15 years, not for five. Custom may soon stale his variety. Swing voters may soon be swinging against him. He may then start to need allies. And the time to cultivate relations-with the Liberal Democrats, with the nationalist parties-is not when they have him over a barrel. It is now.","THE results of last weekend 's elections in Spain and Australia are grim news for Tony Blair , the leader of Britain 's Labour Party .

In a new threat to Taiwan, China conducted military exercises close to the island using live ammunition.

Europe's future
The European Union's 15 member countries made opening bids before the inter-governmental conference on Europe's future, due to start in Turin on March 29th. Britain said it wanted no extension of majority voting in the Council of Ministers. Belgium, the Netherlands and Luxembourg want a more federal Union. France called for greater powers for national parliaments to decide European issues. The European Parliament protested at its exclusion from the conference--and demanded more powers.
The British government suffered an embarrassing defeat in the European Court of Justice, which ruled in favour of a plan by the European Union to introduce a maximum 48-hour working week Britain had claimed exemption under the social clause; the court ruled that it came under health and safety.
Carl Bildt, the European Union's representative in Bosnia, said the Dayton peace plan is in danger of unravelling. He suggested that NATO's implementation force should stay beyond 1996. In Britain's worst lone massacre, a gunman in Scotland shot dead 16 children aged five and six and their teacher in a primary school, and then shot himself. Another 12 children and two teachers were wounded.
The winner of this month's Spanish general election, Jose Maria Aznar, leader of the conservative People's Party, continues to search for a working majority in parliament. After a meeting with Mr Aznar, the defeated Socialist leader, Felipe Gonzalez, prime minister for more than 13 years, said that he would not seek to keep his opponent from office.
With an eye on monetary union in 1999, the finance ministers of both Germany and France announced further limits on public spending. Sluggish economies have kept tax revenues low and unemployment handouts high.
Felix Habsburg-Lothringen, a son of the last emperor of Austria, provoked a row by secretly visiting the country, from which he is banned because he has not renounced his claim to the throne. ""Herr Habsburg is provoking the republic,"" said a senior member of Austria's ruling Social Democrats.
Dole steams on
Senator Bob Dole triumphed in the Super Tuesday primaries, bringing his total of delegates to more than 700. Steve Forbes, the flat-tax candidate, decided to quit the race, but Pat Buchanan, the populists' friend, vowed to keep on fighting. Newt Gingrich, the speaker of the House, urged all Republicans to unite. Mr Dole began to muse aloud about persuading Colin Powell, a retired general, to change his mind and be his running-mate.
Bill Clinton signed into law the Helms-Burton bill tightening trade sanctions on Cuba, and on others investing there. The European Union said it would complain to the World Trade Organisation. Canada and Mexico said they would lodge complaints through NAI;TArn. Most of Latin America reacted angrily. Cuba jeered.
Jack Kevorkian, the champion of assisted suicide and inventor of a suicide machine, was acquitted at his second trial of illegally helping patients to kill themselves. A few days earlier, a federal appeals court in San Francisco (whose decisions are binding on nine western states) ruled that there was a constitutional right to die.

In a bid to keep the Middle East peace process alive, Bill. Clinton and Hosni Mubarak jointly chaired a four hour summit on peace and terrorism at a Red Sea resort. Nearly 30 countries turned up, including European heads of government and representatives from the Arab Gulf states. Syria and Lebanon were notable absentees. In Israel after the summit, Mr Clinton committed $100m to an American-Israeli fight against terrorism.
Israel continued its tight blockade of the West Bank and Gaza, and said it would deport men directly connected to suicide-bombers.

But eventually, six weeks after an inconclusive general election on March 3rd, Spain's politicians are on the verge of forming a government-the first full-blooded conservative one since the death of General Franco in 1975.Jose Maria Aznar, the leader of the People's Party (PP), has taken so long to put together an administration because, although the PP won more seats than Felipe Gonzalez's Socialists, it has 20 fewer than the 176 needed for an overall majority in the lower house of parliament.
Mr Aznar's problem has been that he cannot form a government without gaining the backing of nationalist parties that he had been unwise enough to slight during the election campaign, especially Jordi Pujol's Catalans. Mr Aznar had made the mistake of believing opinion-poll forecasts that he would gain an overall majority. So for the past six weeks he has been trying to disabuse the Catalans of the impression that he is the latest incarnation of Spain's conservative, centralising tradition which, in General Franco's day, forced Catalans to speak Castilian.
Yet when Mr Aznar proclaims that he not only reads and understands the Catalan language but also ""speaks it in private at home"", many are sceptical. After all, on election night nobody discouraged PP supporters when they stood outside their headquarters chanting, ""Pujol, you gnome, speak Castilian at home.""
The PPs eagerness for power has helped Mr Aznar in his bargaining with the nationalists. During the election campaign he had promised to halt devolution to Spain's regions. But that is anathema to the nationalists, who would benefit from Madrid losing further powers, so Mr Aznar has cast aside that pledge.
Mr Pujol has had a rougher ride in the negotiations. He does not have such a tight hold over his party as does Mr Aznar, and he has been worried that a deal with the pp would anger the grass roots. His support for the last Socialist administration cost him votes because of its corrupt image. So Mr Pujol has been obliged to haggle hard over the new government.
Now, however, the broad basis of an agreement appears to be in place. As prime minister, Mr Aznar will have the support of Mr Pujol's 16 Catalans, as well as four Canary Island nationalists and, probably, five Basques. These nationalists will not hold office but will certainly influence policy.
Mr Aznar will probably concede a tax reform to redress an imbalance whereby the Catalans, who put more money into the state coffers than other Spaniards, receive less. Mr Pujol is also asking for more direct control over transport and trade policy, as well as police and prisons. Meanwhile the Canary Islanders want tax concessions which would allow them to go some way towards becoming a tax paradise, while the Basques want to be consulted on anti-terrorist policy.
Given its minority status, Mr Aznar's government-when it finally emerges-is unlikely to be stable. Yet Mr Pujol claims that there is ""a strong measure of agreement on how to handle the economy and on Europe"". That probably means there will be fairly stringent economic policies, designed to make Spain eligible for Europe's currency union. And there will not be a hint of Euro-scepticism from Mr Aznar, since that would bother Mr Pujol, who has long dreamed of nation-states dissolving into a Europe of regions.","IT HAD looked as if they might take as long as the Italians usually do .

WHEN Jose Maria Aznar, leader of the consevatve People's Party (PP), be comes Spain's prime minister this weekend, as he almost certainly will, he will have to thank not only the Catalans but also the Basques. With the support of the largest Catalan party, plus a nod of approval from a handful of Canary Islanders and (perhaps) from a man from Valencia whose party has just one seat, the PP had already clinched the majority it needed to win the investiture vote due on May 4th.
It was, as expected, the Catalan wheelerdealer, Jordi Pujol, who has made Mr Aznar sweat longest and hardest since the PP won the general election in early March without gaining the majority of seats. But it now turns out to be the moderate Basque Nationalist Party, the main vote-winner in Spain's most troubled autonomous region, that has agreed to give Mr Aznar a more comfortable cushion in parliament.
After much, shilly-shallying, the Basque leader, Xabier Arzallus, a hard-talking ex-Jesuit, decided that, if the Catalans could forgive the PP for its centralising Castilian heritage, so could his Basques, though they had vilified the PP during the election as the ""extreme right"". And now Mr Arzallus has gone further than Mr Pujol by actually signing a formal agreement with Mr Aznar. Neither the Basques nor the Catalans will be represented in Mr Aznar's government, but they will both influence it.
Some of the Basque deal is about symbols. It heals an old wound by agreeing to compensate Mr Arzallus's party for property seized or destroyed by General Franco's government The accord also gives the Basques some extra tax advantages, more authority over their ports, a bit more money for training schemes, and a vague commitment to consider more devolution in the future.
But the big issue in the Basque country-how to deal with the problem of terror-is not formally tackled. Yet that is where the accord's significance lies. By agreeing to a pact in parliament, the two parties have in effect agreed to co-operate against the violent separatist group, ETA, which has killed more than 700 people since the 1960s and still has about 500 of its members in Spanish prisons.
The outgoing Socialist government of Felipe Gonzalez tried direct talks with ETA (Spain's Supreme Court this week cleared Mr Gonzalez of conducting a ""dirty war"" against the terrorists as well) to stop the killing and beat the rebels, and got Mr Arzallus's party to act as a go-between. One unfortunate result was that, by seeming to consort with ETA, the moderate nationalists were merely tarred with the terrorist brush-and it became unclear, in many Spanish eyes, where they really stood themselves. Mr Aznar's likely interior minister, Jaime Mayor Oreja, himself a Basque, says he will take a different route. Terrorism, he says, should be discussed in an existing forum which embraces all parties committed to non-violence. The PP, he says, will talk to ETA only if it first lays down its arms.
The hope is that the deal will increase the clout of the moderate nationalists. The Basques' support for ETA has been falling. The vote for its political wing dropped in the election, though it still won two seats against the moderates' five. The killing goes on. But ever more Basques want to see it stop. And the deal between Mr Aznar and Mr Arzallus could now give peaceful Basques an avenue for influencing the new government in Madrid.","MADRID

Jose Maria Aznar's likely interior minister , Jaime Mayor Oreja , himself a Basque , says he will take a different route . Terrorism , he says , should be discussed in an existing forum which embraces all parties committed to non - violence . The PP , he says , will talk to ETA only if it first lays down its arms . 
 The hope is that the deal will increase the clout of the moderate nationalists . The Basques ' support for ETA has been falling . The vote for its political wing dropped in the election , though it still won two seats against the moderates ' five . The killing goes on . But ever more Basques want to see it stop . And the deal between Jose Maria Aznar and Mr Arzallus could now give peaceful Basques an avenue for influencing the new government in Madrid .",230,Spain,A29-4231,PRE TERM,True,"Jose Maria Aznar , leader of the consevatve People 's Party ( PP )",9,True

In opposition, sceptics said he was unelectable. After his narrow election victory on March 3rd, they claimed he could never govern. Now they say he will not deliver. 
Judging by his first few days in office, Mr Aznar may prove his critics wrong again. The former tax inspector from Madrid, who claims to take pride in his lack of charisma, has so far played a weak hand well. His conservative Peoples Party (PP) fared worse in the general election on March 3rd than opinion polls had suggested, scoring just 39% of the vote. Pundits predicted a weak government at the mercy of regional parties like Catalonia's Convergence and Union, the biggest of the lot Punters had the same worry and knocked 6% off the value of the stockmarket in the days after the election. 
But Mr Aznar's party had more in common with the Catalans and other regional parties than doubters had realised. Their differences centre mainly on how much autonomy Spain's regions should have: the PP has centralising instincts that the others resist. On economic issues, the Catalans are as peseta-pinching as Mr Aznar's party. So the deal struck by the PP and three other regional groupings (including the Catalans, a Basque party and a small party from the Canary Islands) will do less damage to Mr Aznar's freedom to govern than many had feared. The regional parties refused to accept ministries in the government to avoid being bound to its policies (though Josep Pique, the new industry minister, is a businessman close to the Catalans). 
At least one concession could prove awkward for Mr Aznar's plans: a deal to let the regions levy, collect and spend 30% of income tax, up from 15% before. Mr Aznar has sidestepped questions about whether giving up this much revenue will damage his governments finances. But there is at least a chance that, once regions get more power to tax as well as spend, they will become less profligate rather than more so. Having curbed its centralising impulses, the Pr may discover that the regional parties were its natural allies all along. 
The buck stops 
So Mr Aznar cannot duck responsibility for the economic consequences of his policies. His rhetoric on becoming prime minister was meant to reassure anyone listening. Getting Spain's huge number of unemployed back to work, which the outgoing Socialist Party failed to do during its 13 years in office (see chart), was his top prior ity. He offered the unions immediate talks on a job-creating ""social pact"". To businessmen he promised privatisation, tax incentives and labour-law reform. And he pledged to cut the public-sector deficit from 5.8% of GDP last year to 3% in 1997, so that Spain could join the single European currency to be created two years later. 
The new finance minister, Americaneducated Rodrigo Rato, has drawn up a plan to cut around Pta200 billion ($1.56 billion--0.4% of GDP-from spending by all government departments this year. The Catalans want four times that sum. Public works and the civil service will bear the brunt. This austerity is to be monitored by a new budget management office, to be headed by Jose Barea, a 73-year-old academic already dubbed Scissorhands"". Mr 
Barea has called for cuts in tax exemptions, which cost Spain up to Pta2 trillion a year. On May 7th Spain's central bank rewarded the new government's tough line by cutting its benchmark interest rate a quarter of a percentage point. 
Eventually, though, Mr Aznar must offend somebody if he wants to cure the structural problems responsible for Spain's 23% unemployment rate: rigid labour laws, loss-making state industry and an expensive social-security system. It will not be pensioners who suffer, since the prime minister has already promised that their benefits will not be touched. He might prune social security, however, by privatising some aspects of health care. 
The trade unions will prove Mr Aznar's most formidable foes. His social pact"" proposals are likely to include the sale, slaughter or overhaul of several state industries, which cost the government Ptal.3 billion a year, and a liberalisation of labour laws, which stifle employment by making it difficult to sack workers. He will face Antonio Gutierrez, the dynamic young leader of one of Spain's two main unions, this one drawing its members mainly from the state sector. Mr Gutierrez represents a new generation of trade unionist, more willing to compromise with employers than his predecessors, who had strong links to the Communist Party. But his members will take to the streets if Mr Aznar's reforms go too far. 
Another disappointed partner may be the European Union. The new foreign minister, Abel Matutes, has embarrassed MrAznar by calling for a delay in Europe's economic and monetary union to give Spain a chance to be among the first participants. Many economists agree that Spain has little chance of meeting the required targets for budget deficits and debt, especially if growth slows this year as expected. But this is not an admission Mr Aznar wants to make when he is pushing for spending cuts. If growth picks up, helped by lower interest rates, sceptics may discover they have underestimated Mr Aznar again. ","Jose Maria Aznar's , is an easy man to underestimate .

After winning the general election (but failing to get an outright parliamentary majority) on March 3rd, he took two months to cut a deal with moderate Catalan and Basque nationalists to get a functioning minority government on track. 
Now, after another month of haggling, partly within his People's Party, he has come up with his first serious batch of measures to tackle-among other things-tax, telecoms, land and energy laws, and restrictive professional guilds. This week's package of economic reforms has, however, pleased most Spanish businessmen and reassured the markets, which were beginning to get twitchy. Still, there is plenty more to be done. 
As a rule, bundles of reforms look more impressive than the same measures announced singly, and Mr Aznar's package of inducements to growth is no exception. Its main elements are: * a cut in inheritance tax and simplification of capital-gains tax, both designed to help business; * the abolition of minimum fees earned by professionals like doctors and lawyers and of restrictions on where they can practise; the creation of a competitor to Telefonica de Espana, the partly privatised telecoms monopoly; * the scrapping of price controls for some fuels and the introduction of competition for state-owned energy companies; * the removal of building restrictions, which could triple the amount of land on the market 
The package comes with a high price tag-an estimated Pta2oo billion ($1.5 billion) in lost government revenue this year from the tax cuts alone. Like America's Reaganauts in the 198os, though, Mr Aznar's men reckon that the growth unleashed by their supply-side reforms will refill the government's coffers by next year, leading to lower interest rates, a smaller budget deficit and still higher growth. 
This bravado makes it easy to forget what the package leaves out. For fear of of fending the trade unions, Mr Aznar shied away from reforming labour laws to make it easier to sack (and thus to hire) workers. He left Spain's complex, loophole-ridden income-tax system untouched. The Pta2oo billion of spending cuts Mr Aznar announced soon after taking office look unambitious: technocrats on his economic team who argued for cuts of up to four times as big were muzzled. Profitable stateowned firms like Endesa (Spain's biggest electricity company) and Argentaria, a bank, are to be privatised (with Mr Aznar's friends comfortably ensconced in their boardrooms), but nothing has been said about the fate of loss-making mines and the state airline Iberia, or about other state firms that cost the government Ptal trillion a year. The government is considering bolder measures. The danger is it will quietly let them die. 
Mr Aznar can afford to be courageous. The official unemployment rate, 23% by one type of reckoning, is among Europe's highest. Expected growth this year has been cut from 2.8% to 2.3%, despite a recent sharp drop in interest rates. Spaniards are prepared to take the pain if the result is more jobs.

In the teeth of union opposition (after Si years of state control) the government wants to sell 6% of the company, reducing its holding to 46%. A welcome sign of the success of privatisation in Europe? Not entirely. The government is asking FFr139 ($27) for each Renault share, FFr26 less than the first public offer, in 1994. 
The poor price can be blamed in part on Renault's troubles in selling cars in a dull European market. But that is not the whole story. Governments everywhere have lately been finding state-owned companies harder to privatise than they had hoped. At the beginning of 1995 analysts held out the prospect of Western European governments raising $50 billion by selling companies to investors in that year; in fact they raised just $24 billion, according to J.P. Morgan, an American investment bank. 
For 1996, however, analysts are cautiously optimistic. J.P. Morgan expects that more than $40 billion-worth of companies will be sold in Western Europe this year. In a new report, the OECD predicts that receipts from privatisation could reach $85 billion worldwide, with well over half of the sales coming from Western Europe. Morgan Stanley, another American investment bank, estimates that assets worth $250 billion-300 billion could be sold over the next few years. That is almost twice as much as was raised by European privatisations in 1985-95. This wave of privatisation could virtually double the market capitalisation of some of Europe's smallest stockmarkets, such as Portugal's. 
The largest single flotation in 1996 will be Germany's sale in November of part of Deutsche Telekom,which the OECD expects to raise $io billion. But the pressure to privatise will be felt most in Italy and France. Their privatisation programmes slipped badly last year, and both governments desperately need cash. Though money made from privatisation does not count in calculating budget deficits, which are being squeezed in the run-up to economic and monetary union in Europe, it can be useful for reducing public debt-another of the Maastricht treaty's criteria. 
At the start of June Italy's new government declared its intention to press ahead with privatisation. A couple of weeks later Italy sold a 3.2 trillion lire ($2.1 billion) stake in INA, an insurer. IMI, a bank, is also on course for a quick sale, and later this year the government will probably sell a second tranche of shares in ENI, an energy and chemicals group. STET, a telecoms company, will be privatised ""soon""; ENEL, the state electricity producer, ""next year"". 
France has also been busy. As well as selling shares in partially privatised firms, such as Renault, the government has taken advantage of a rising stockmarket to sell an insurer, Assurances Generales de France. It has suggested privatising Snecma, which makes aeroengines. The government is looking for a buyer for Thomson, a holding company that controls Thomson-csF, a listed defence-electronics firm. And, none too soon, France has broken a taboo by preparing a partial sale of France Telecom. 
France and Italy will take heart from the success of some recent sales. The Portuguese government announced on June 12th that it had successfully sold just over a fifth of Portugal Telecom, cutting the state's stake in the company to 51%. The appetite for shares was greater than in any of Portugal's earlier privatisations. And yet, according to Morgan Stanley, despite such occasional successes, governments will still have to lay out their stalls with great care. 
A tough sell 
The picture is complicated by the fact that most of the best candidates were sold first. Having got rid of its oil companies, airline and most utilities, Britain is now selling off its railways and nuclear-power stations. In continental Europe there could be interference from unions in, say, utilities, or from governments in industries such as airlines, where national pride is at stake. Just as worrying is the fact that continental European investors have learnt from bitter experience that privatisation is not always the gravy train that governments promise. 
On the whole, shares in privatised companies have underperformed the rest of the equity market. Indeed, anyone who took part in French privatisations since 1990 would have lost money (see chart on previous page). The exceptions are in Austria, where some high-tech privatisations were on offer, and Britain, where shares just about kept pace with the market. 
In order to tempt investors, governments have therefore taken to offering sweeteners with their privatisation offers. When the Spanish government sold later tranches of Repsol, the national oil company, it promised to hand back investors some of their money if the share price performed badly. This approach has been repeated with Argentaria, a Spanish bank. Italy broke new ground in the privatisation of INA when it became the first government amongst the G7 rich countries to sell bonds that can be later converted into shares. 
Too bad that the same governments seem bent on deterring shareholders by interfering with the very companies they have privatised. The recently elected govemment of Jose Maria Aznar, Spain's new prime minister, wants to speed up the privatisation programme-encouraging reports that the small remaining stakes in Gas Natural and Repsol, two energy firms, will be sold. Nevertheless, one of the government's first acts has been to kick out the-perfectly competent-bosses of three partially private firms: Repsol, Tabacalera, a tobacco company, and Telefonica, the national telephone company.

LAST month Basque Homeland and Freedom, the terrorist separatists better known as ETA, called a halt to a campaign of bombing, shooting and kidnapping that has plagued Spain since 1968. The truce lasted only a week. Since then, bombs have exploded in the cities of Granada,Jaen and Pamplona. Several have gone off near Malaga. This week ETA declared it was unable to ""guarantee the safety"" of bicyclists competing in the Tour de France, which briefly winds over the Pyrenean border into the Spanish province of Navarre, home to a small Basque population. In the past two months ETA has killed another security man, bringing the total number of ETA-related deaths to more than 75o spread over nearly three decades. 
But the short-lived ceasefire prompted a surge of hope across Spain, especially in the three Basque provinces, that the violence might somehow be brought to an end. It certainly will not happen soon. But several factors suggest that-in contrast to the situation in Northern Ireland (see overleaf)the Basque problem may be destined gradually to wane. 
The brief hold-off was the first since talks between ETA and Felipe Gonzalez's Socialist government broke down in 1989. Spain's interior minister, Jaime Mayor Oreja, himself a Basque, now expects ETA to step up attacks this summer. But in the longer term he reckons that the outlook is less bleak. He may well be right. 
One hopeful sign is that support for Herri Batasuna, ETA'S political wing, has been dipping. Two years ago it lost its one seat in the election for the European Parliament. In Spain's last general election, in March, it barely held its brace of seats in the Madrid parliament. But it still won a tenth of the votes cast in the Basque region. 
A less expected gleam of hope comes from a growing cordiality between Jose Maria Aznar's new conservative government in Madrid and the moderates of the Basque National Party, the Basques' largest, with which Mr Aznar has formed a parliamentary pact. ETA had hoped that some of the harsh rhetoric used by Mr Aznar's People's Party (Pp) during the election campaign would alienate moderate Basques and make them more susceptible to extreme Basque sentiment. But the opposite has happened, with the PP changing its tune in government. ""There is no doubt ETA is deeply disconcerted by this,"" Mr Mayor Oreja rightly surmises. 
Furthermore, non-violent parties in the Basque region, in response to the truce, are enjoying a streak of unusual harmony. During the truce, they agreed to a joint platform for opening a dialogue with ETA. Mr Mayor Oreja also impressed Basques with an offer to move some ETA prisoners closer to their homeland. Basque nationalists-even nonviolent ones-resent the fact that most of Spain's 6oo-odd ETA prisoners are deliberately scattered across the country. 
In any event, a new bout of talks between ETA and the government is not in the offing. But the best long-term hope is that Basques as a whole are becoming increasingly impatient with the terrorists. ETA has, if anything, become more dogmatic under a new generation of hotheads. Peace movements in the Basque country are getting stronger. Almost everyone in the region blamed ETA for ending the truce. 
Another dampener for ETA is that the new government in Madrid is better placed than its predecessor to pep up the forces of counter-terrorism. Attempts to get the better of ETA were badly harmed by the scandal of the Anti-Terrorist Liberation Groups, the government-linked death squads which took the law into their own hands by killing more than two dozen ETA suspects (along with some victims who turned out to be innocent) in the mid198os. Such methods prompted a wave of separatist sympathy among Basques. The new government should also benefit from growing co-operation with the French authorities, who are much more thorough and amenable than they used to be in hunting down and sending back ETA suspects on their side of the Pyrenees. 
None of this will end ETA'S campaign. Some 140,000 Basques still vote for ETA's political arm. Militarily it is far from beaten. But, despite the odd outrage, it is being more or less contained. The number of ETA-related deaths so far this year-fourmeans that the death rate is now the lowest for more than two decades. The average yearly toll since 1992 is 17. 
The reason for the relatively low level of violence is that Basque autonomy is working rather welL During the repressive Franco era, many Basques had a sneakingor not so sneaking-sympathy for ETA, but since then Basques have won a wider measure of autonomy than they have had probably in their entire history. Mr Aznar may give them still more: the return of property confiscated under Franco, some extra tax advantages, more authority over ports, a bit more cash for training. The moderate Basques want a touch more devolution all round, with more control over labour, employment laws and social security. 
Will moderate Basques ever be satisfied, or is their unspoken ambition really, like ETA's more blunt one, outright independence? That is the question that still worries people in Castile. It cannot be definitively answered. What seems plain, though, is that the more successful the moderate Basques are in winning concessions, the weaker ETA becomes-and the closer an eventual end to terrorism in Spain. ","Spain 's Basque nationalists have created continental Europe 's most intractable terrorist problem . The violence will not go away , but it may dwindle 
 LAST month Basque Homeland and Freedom , the terrorist separatists better known as ETA , called a halt to a campaign of bombing , shooting and kidnapping that has plagued Spain since 1968 . The truce lasted only a week . Since then , bombs have exploded in the cities of Granada , Jaen and Pamplona . Several have gone off near Malaga . This week ETA declared it was unable to "" guarantee the safety "" of bicyclists competing in the Tour de France , which briefly winds over the Pyrenean border into the Spanish province of Navarre , home to a small Basque population . In the past two months ETA has killed another security man , bringing the total number of ETA - related deaths to more than 75o spread over nearly three decades . 
 But the short - lived ceasefire prompted a surge of hope across Spain , especially in the three Basque provinces , that the violence might somehow be brought to an end . It certainly will not happen soon . But several factors suggest that - in contrast to the situation in Northern Ireland ( see overleaf)the Basque problem may be destined gradually to wane . 
 The brief hold - off was the first since talks between ETA and Felipe Gonzalez 's Socialist government broke down in 1989 . Spain 's interior minister , Jaime Mayor Oreja , himself a Basque , now expects ETA to step up attacks this summer . But in the longer term he reckons that the outlook is less bleak . He may well be right . 
 One hopeful sign is that support for Herri Batasuna , ETA 'S political wing , has been dipping . Two years ago it lost its one seat in the election for the European Parliament . In Spain 's last general election , in March , it barely held its brace of seats in the Madrid parliament . But it still won a tenth of the votes cast in the Basque region . 
 A less expected gleam of hope comes from a growing cordiality between Jose Maria Aznar's new conservative government in Madrid and the moderates of the Basque National Party , the Basques ' largest , with which Jose Maria Aznar has formed a parliamentary pact . ETA had hoped that some of the harsh rhetoric used by Jose Maria Aznar's People 's Party ( Pp ) during the election campaign would alienate moderate Basques and make them more susceptible to extreme Basque sentiment . But the opposite has happened , with the PP changing its tune in government . "" There is no doubt ETA is deeply disconcerted by this , "" Mr Mayor Oreja rightly surmises . 
 Furthermore , non - violent parties in the Basque region , in response to the truce , are enjoying a streak of unusual harmony . During the truce , they agreed to a joint platform for opening a dialogue with ETA . Mr Mayor Oreja also impressed Basques with an offer to move some ETA prisoners closer to their homeland . Basque nationalists - even nonviolent ones - resent the fact that most of Spain 's 6oo - odd ETA prisoners are deliberately scattered across the country . 
 In any event , a new bout of talks between ETA and the government is not in the offing . But the best long - term hope is that Basques as a whole are becoming increasingly impatient with the terrorists . ETA has , if anything , become more dogmatic under a new generation of hotheads . Peace movements in the Basque country are getting stronger . Almost everyone in the region blamed ETA for ending the truce . 
 Another dampener for ETA is that the new government in Madrid is better placed than its predecessor to pep up the forces of counter - terrorism . Attempts to get the better of ETA were badly harmed by the scandal of the Anti - Terrorist Liberation Groups , the government - linked death squads which took the law into their own hands by killing more than two dozen ETA suspects ( along with some victims who turned out to be innocent ) in the mid198os . Such methods prompted a wave of separatist sympathy among Basques .

The budget to be presented to parliament on September 30th will be the first big test of their sharpness. But since Jose Maria Aznar and his People's Party(PP) took office in May, his dental revelations have been mixed. 
Before the election, Mr Aznar's most daring promise was to overhaul the economy. Now that he is in power, he has yet to gird himself for battle. By temperament he is not the sort of leader who rushes headlong into the fray. But the financial markets, as well as radical reformers in the conservative camp, have been getting nervous. Hence the budget's importance. 
To give Mr Aznar his due, he has been hamstrung from the start because he failed to win an outright majority in the general election in March. He depends on support in parliament from the wiliest operator in Spanish politics, Jordi Pujol, and his mainstream Catalan nationalists. Mr Aznar also has the backing of the biggest (and non-violent) Basque nationalist party. But support from the Basques has been undermined by the long-festering row over the Anti-Terrorist Liberation Groups, better known by their acronym GAL They were the government death-squads that killed about two dozen Basque terrorist suspects (including some who turned out to be innocent) in the 198os, when Spain was run by Felipe Gonzalez and his Socialists. Mr Aznar was happy to gain from the GAL scandal before and during the election campaign. But now suspicions are arising that he may have come to a tacit understanding with Mr Gonzalez: it is insinuated that, provided Mr Aznar does not delve too deeply into the murky GAL business, Mr Gonzalez will give him an easy ride. So far he has. 
An easy ride might not, in the long run, do Mr Aznar much good. Soon after the PP took office, his new interior minister,Jaime Mayor Oreja, himself a Basque, pleased the nationalists by beefing up the anti-terror pact which the main Basque and Catalan parties, among others, have supported. But the government's decision that secret service documents on the GAL should not be shown to the courts, plus a suggestion that it might bring in a restrictive new officialsecrets law, has annoyed not only Basques but many judges and journalists. 
The least Mr Aznar must now do is ensure that his finance minister, Rodrigo Rato, produces a convincing budget. The background is not all gloom. Though Spain continues to have the highest official unemployment in the European Union, even before the pp took over most of the figures were moving the right way. Moreover, unemployment has been creeping down. So, at 4%, has inflation. Though the budget deficit, now a dreadful 6.4% of GDP (more than twice the Maastricht minimum), is proving hard to shrink, it is meant to drop to 4.4% this year and 3% next. National debt, at 65.7% of GDP, is nearing the Maastricht ceiling of 6o%. 
Mr Rato has been promising fiercer spending cuts and a freeze on civil servants' salaries. He has already put up taxes on tobacco and alcohol. He wants to kill several sick state-owned industries, a legacy of General Franco's corporatism which the Socialists did too little to unpick. Mr Rato is trying, too, to get private backers to keep alive various infrastructure projects which will otherwise be cut Another deficit-slashing ploy is to privatise faster. Mr Rato says he can raise Ptai trillion ($7.9 billion) by selling Telefonica (the state telecoms company), Argentaria (a big bank) and Repsol (the state oil company). 
Needless to say, some proposals have provoked squeals. When Mr Rato suggested partial charges for medical prescriptions, Mr Pujol sounded so edgy that the idea had, for the time being, to be junked. Tax reform will also be fraught. The Catalans won agreement some time ago that Spain's regional authorities should collect and spend a full 3o% of income tax. The nationalists are poised to fight any proposal to return tax-raising powers to the centre. Though Mr Aznar made plain during the election campaign that he thought devolution had gone far enough, he now has to pander to the nationalists. Yet this, in turn, is irritating his own PP lieutenants in the regions-one of whom, Alex Vidal Quadras, the PP chief in Catalonia, has resigned in protest. 
It was never likely that a minority government bent on radical reform of Spain's economy (and now, apparently, equally determined to meet the Maastricht criteria) would be popular. But Mr Aznar is being chastised as much for the dithering way in which he is presenting policy as for the unpleasantness of the medicine he seems bound to administer. Still, although he has to look over his shoulder at the awkward Mr Pujol, Mr Aznar is fairly well placed to start acting robustly. Mr Gonzalez and his Socialists have not recovered from their defeat. The regional parties are still broadly on side. The trade unions are weak: this week they agreed to a government scheme on pensions. Mr Aznar should have four years ahead of him.

Sweden, which may not join, and Norway, which cannot, would get a warmer welcome. First, the southerners 
A FEW weeks ago, it looked as if economic and monetary union would be one of Europe's cosier clubs. Germany and France would be its pillars; its other founders would either have long records of low inflation or be too small to matter. Not any more. Italy and Spain, big countries whose commitment to price stability and fiscal discipline is suspiciously nouveau, suddenly look fair prospects to be among EMU'S first members. The decorous inauguration planned for January 1999 may turn out to be a stampede. 
For governments that expected to join EMU as members of a privileged clique, that is unnerving. This week France's president, Jacques Chirac, unwisely blurted out his doubts about Italy's fitness for EMU. Only after Italy's prime minister, Romano Prodi, threatened to cancel a planned summit with Mr Chirac did the French president retreat. Germany's chancellor, Helmut Kohl, is more diplomatic in public but probably equally worried.A recent book by Klaus Methfessel, a German journalist, predicts that bond markets will collapse and interest rates will soar if investors believe that Germany is about to swap its D-mark for a single currency (the euro) shared with Italy and Spain. That prophecy is probably too dark, but the problem for Mr Kohl is that many Germans believe it. 
The latest dash for EMu began after Spain's prime minister, Jose Maria Aznar, rejected Mr Prodi's suggestion that Spain and Italy should push together for a weakening of Maastricht criteria, which require participants to hold down their budget deficits, debt, inflation and interest rates. Mr Aznar flourished a budget that promises to cut Spain's deficit next year to the Maastricht target of 3% of GDP partly through a real cut in spending of 1%. 
Italy, Mr Prodi realised, could do no less. Besides, he may have reckoned, signing up for the euro in the first wave may be the one way to silence Umberto Bossi's Northern League, which wants northern Italy to secede and join EMU. On September 27th, Mr Prodi said Italy's government would cut its deficit by 62.5 trillion lire ($41 billion) next year, nearly twice the amount earlier proposed. About half the extra savings will come from a one-time ""tax for Europe"", which will cut the pay packets of high earners by up to 2m lire. Mr Bossi, who thinks northerners pay too much tax already, is not pleased. 
Will 11th-hour measures get Italy and Spain into a club whose other members have tied their currencies to the D-mark for years? They face two tests: first, an economic obstacle course, then, it they complete that, judgment by a political tribunal. 
Neither country is likely to hit the Maastricht targets for deficits and debt. The question is whether they will come close enough to merit consideration for joining EMU in the first wave or very shortly thereafter. Italy will need lots of luck. Government revenue is weak because the economy is weak, and much of the savings Mr Prodi hopes to secure is to come from undefined ""treasury operations"". But declining inflation reduces interest rates, which cuts the cost of funding Italy's massive debt and so lowers the deficit. The more financial markets are convinced Italy will qualify in the first wave, the more likely it is to happen. Investors will buy more lira bonds, driving down interest rates still faster. Ilaria Fornari, an economist at J.P. Morgan in Milan, reckons that Italy has an outside chance of getting its deficit close to 4% of GDP next year. 
Spain's chances look brighter. Its economy is stronger than Italy's, though perhaps not as strong as the government assumes. The inflation target may be a tougher hurdle than the deficit criterion, but the government can reduce Spain's inflation rate by cutting prices it controls (like electricity rates). Both Spain and Italy are relying heavily on gimmickry and one-off savings. Italy's Europe tax, for example, expires after a year. Spain will shift subsidies to publicly owned companies off-budget by guaranteeing loans to help make up for the lost subsidies. 
If Germany, France, Belgium and other members of the early-EMu clique cut their deficits to 3% of GDP or less next year, as the IMF predicts (see chart on previous page), they could still exclude the southern upstarts. Things will get messy, though, if any of the northerners misses the target and if any southerner manages a deficit of less than 4%. Complaints that the southerners have used tricks to get there will not wash; the elite are also guilty of gimmickry. France, for example, is counting on a huge cash payment in return for assuming some pension liabilities. ""If the French get away with it,"" said Mr Prodi to the Financial Times, then we can show them a trick or two as well."" What's more, southerners will be among the judges. Approval for a hardcore EMU could be blocked by three or four countries in the EU'S Council of Ministers, including Britain, which may be one of the few EU members wanting to stay out 
What can the Germans and French do other than tear their hair? Germany is putting its faith in a ""stability pact"" to force governments to tackle the costs lurking in pensions and other programmes even after EMU starts. Its partners have agreed in principle, but remain at odds over crucial details. Will a ""stability council"" of governments, an idea championed by France, decide when to impose sanctions on countries with big deficits, or will they be automatic, as Germany wants? Will governments be allowed to breach the 3% ceiling only after four consecutive quarters of economic contraction (Germany's idea) or under unspecified ""exceptional circumstances"" (France's preference)? 
Paul De Grauwe, an economist at the Catholic University in Leuven, suggests other arrangements that could reassure the Germans. Countries with excessive deficits could be denied votes in the future European Central Bank. The central bank's board could be sacked if inflation rises. Without arrangements like these, Mr De Grauwe predicts that Germany will opt for postponing EMU rather than going ahead with countries like Spain and Italy. Maybe. But, as recent history shows, all predictions are hazardous.

No such luck. First the court embarrassed Mr Gonzalez this week when its judges decided by only six votes to four not to have him formally questioned. Then the attorney-general stressed that he could be summoned if, as seems to happen with alarming regularity, fresh evidence were to emerge. 
Suspicion will linger that Mr Gonzalez at least knew more than he has admitted about the ""anti-terrorist groups"", generally known by their acronym GAL, which killed some 28 suspected Basque separatists in the 1980s. An interior minister under Mr Gonzalez, Jose Barrionuevo, has been formally charged with setting GAL up. 
No less worrying for the Spanish left, in the longer term, is the growing feeling that in opposition, after nearly 14 years in office, it does not know where it is going. It does not seem much at ease with Mr Gonzalez. But no alternative leader is in sight. 
Mr Gonzalez seems determined to stay on. After the general election last March, a few brave Socialists dared suggest he might go. Mr Gonzalez, after all, had led the party since 1974 and as prime minister since 1982. But, though he thought of standing down before the election, he believed the result, which was closer than expected, vindicated his decision to stay on. The critics fell silent Party bigwigs argue bizarrely that, yes, the party needs change, but that the man to enforce it is, yes, Mr Gonzalez. 
True, he remains a skilful operator. He it was who steered the Socialists to the middle ground and emasculated the old left. He benefits from Spain's traditional susceptibility to caudillismo, the rule of strongmen in politics. Felipe alone, sigh his admirers, has charisma. A lot of pensioners and poor rural types would agree. One recent opinion poll put him back ahead of the conservative prime minister, Jose Maria Aznar. But many young and middleclass people are disenchanted, not just with the party's policies but also with its tired and tainted image. They might warm to the party if it had a new leader. But who? Josep Borrell, an American-educated Catalan who was public-works minister, might like a shot at the job. A self-made man with a gift of the gab, he is not especially liked, either on the right of the party or by his fellow Catalans. Joaquin Almunia, the party's parliamentary spokesman, could be a compromise leader-but is too loyal to Mr Gonzalez even to consider seeking the post. Alfredo Perez Rubalcaba, another loyalist, might also hold the party together. NATO'S secretary-general, Javier Solana, might conceivably be lured back from Brussels. But there is a whiff of the Gonzalez era about all these people. They do not smell of change. Yet there are simply no younger Socialists coming through. 
Some say the United Left, made up mainly of old communists, which got ii% in the election, should team up with the Socialists, who got 38%. But rapprochement is far away. One bit of the United Left which recently split off is close in spirit to the Socialists but too small to matter. The rest of the party is in the grip of another entrenched boss,Julio Anguita, but he and Mr Gonzalez detest each other. Forget a broadleft alliance so long as the old leader stays on. The Supreme Court may have given a lease of political life to Mr Gonzalez-but not, it seems, to the Spanish left. ","THE Spanish Socialists , who lost power eight months ago , have been hoping that a Supreme Court ruling would clear their leader , Felipe Gonzalez , once and for all of direct involvement in the "" dirty war "" against Basque separatist guerrillas in the mid-198os - and give the left something to cheer about . No such luck . First the court embarrassed Mr Gonzalez this week when its judges decided by only six votes to four not to have him formally questioned . Then the attorney - general stressed that he could be summoned if , as seems to happen with alarming regularity , fresh evidence were to emerge . 
 Suspicion will linger that Mr Gonzalez at least knew more than he has admitted about the "" anti - terrorist groups "" , generally known by their acronym GAL , which killed some 28 suspected Basque separatists in the 1980s . An interior minister under Mr Gonzalez , Jose Barrionuevo , has been formally charged with setting GAL up . 
 No less worrying for the Spanish left , in the longer term , is the growing feeling that in opposition , after nearly 14 years in office , it does not know where it is going . It does not seem much at ease with Mr Gonzalez . But no alternative leader is in sight . 
 Mr Gonzalez seems determined to stay on . After the general election last March , a few brave Socialists dared suggest he might go . Mr Gonzalez , after all , had led the party since 1974 and as Jose Maria Aznar since 1982 . But , though he thought of standing down before the election , he believed the result , which was closer than expected , vindicated his decision to stay on . The critics fell silent Party bigwigs argue bizarrely that , yes , the party needs change , but that the man to enforce it is , yes , Mr Gonzalez . 
 True , he remains a skilful operator . He it was who steered the Socialists to the middle ground and emasculated the old left . He benefits from Spain 's traditional susceptibility to caudillismo , the rule of strongmen in politics . Felipe alone , sigh his admirers , has charisma . A lot of pensioners and poor rural types would agree . One recent opinion poll put him back ahead of the conservative prime minister , Jose Maria Aznar . But many young and middleclass people are disenchanted , not just with the party 's policies but also with its tired and tainted image . They might warm to the party if it had a new leader . But who ? Josep Borrell , an American - educated Catalan who was public - works minister , might like a shot at Jose Maria Aznar . A self - made man with a gift of the gab , he is not especially liked , either on the right of the party or by his fellow Catalans . Joaquin Almunia , the party 's parliamentary spokesman , could be a compromise leader - but is too loyal to Mr Gonzalez even to consider seeking Jose Maria Aznar . Alfredo Perez Rubalcaba , another loyalist , might also hold the party together . NATO 'S secretary - general , Javier Solana , might conceivably be lured back from Brussels . But there is a whiff of the Gonzalez era about all these people . They do not smell of change . Yet there are simply no younger Socialists coming through . 
 Some say the United Left , made up mainly of old communists , which got ii% in the election , should team up with the Socialists , who got 38 % . But rapprochement is far away . One bit of the United Left which recently split off is close in spirit to the Socialists but too small to matter . The rest of the party is in the grip of another entrenched boss , Julio Anguita , but he and Mr Gonzalez detest each other . Forget a broadleft alliance so long as the old leader stays on . The Supreme Court may have given a lease of political life to Mr Gonzalez - but not , it seems , to the Spanish left .",230,Spain,A29-4231,IN TERM,True,prime minister,3,True

In particular, Jordi Pujol, Catalonia's canny president, is jealously demanding that some special tax concessions recently wrested by Basque nationalists in return for their five-seat support should be granted to the Catalans too. As he does not have to point out, it is the 16 seats belonging to his Catalan party that keep in power the minority conservative government, elected in March. 
At his recent party conference, Mr Pujol set a target-zoo-for Catalonia's achieving the same preferential tax regime enjoyed by the Basques. But that is not all: the new fiscal system, he said, should be part of a much broader state pact that recognises ""Catalonia's national identity"". Mr Pujol is not just hinting that Catalonia might, one day, form part of a ""Europe of regions"" that would be beyond Madrid's control altogether. His demand also shows how Spain's regional leaders are bidding against each other to get as many concessions as they can from the centre. 
Mr Pujol can afford to be bold. His party kept the Socialists going when they lost their majority in 1993, until he pulled the plug this year. He then switched allegiance to the conservative People's Party, but not without extracting some fat concessions, partly in revenge for the anti-regional slights the new prime minister, Jose Maria Aznar, had scattered during the election campaign. And Mr Pujol is well placed to ask for more. Spaniards tend to vote centre-left, but in March the left-wing vote was split, making the conservatives the largest single party for the first time since Franco died in 1975. Many Spaniards, however, are still wary of the right. The People's Party, despite winning, got under 39% of the vote. That is why the regional parties, Catalans above all, hold the balance of power-and are likely to go on doing so. 
The Basques, however, resent what they see as an attempt by Mr Pujol to queer their pitch. ""Why does Catalonia expect us to pave the way?"" asks Xabier Arzallus, leader of the mainstream Basque Nationalist Party. Since the tax-collection system is based on an accord that dates back more than a century, he argues he is simply asking Mr Aznar to honour existing agreements, not to grant new concessions. 
Today the Basques pay the central government an agreed whack as their contribution to services such as defence and foreign affairs. But they are determined to push their luck to the hilt. They voted for Mr Aznar's first budget last month only after he let them collect alcohol, tobacco and petrol taxes. And they have unilaterally lowered company tax from 35% to 32%, outraging other regions which scream that this is unfair competition. The issue is in the courts. 
Regional financing has become such a vexed question that Felipe Gonzalez, the Socialists' leader, recently offered a crossparty pact to deal with it. Yet there seems little reason to believe that one of the main concessions Mr Pujol extracted (for all Spain's regions) in return for his support of Mr Aznar-direct responsibility for collecting and spending 30% of income tax-will cost the country money. It could even have a beneficial result, making the regions more careful about their own spending. 
The worry is that regional demands may spiral beyond control. After Franco's death, Spain tried to deal with Basque and Catalan nationalism by dividing the whole country into 17 regions with varying degrees of autonomy. Hence the Basques and Catalans now constantly stress their distinctive claims to nationhood, while the other regions try to emulate them. 
During the election campaign, Mr Aznar said the degree of autonomy granted each area should be negotiated and fixed once and for all. However, the election result knocked that ambition on the head. Since then, inter-regional wrangles have become so convoluted that people now complain Spain is negotiating itself back to the multi-state system that existed before unification in the 15th century.

But its future road, says John Peet, is strewn with hazards; not least the uncertainties of European economic and monetary union 
IN TOLEDO, the city of El Greco that was once Spain's capital. stands one of the country's architectural jewels: a medieval building known as La Sinagoga del Transito. Its combination of Moorish, Jewish and, later, Catholic influences symbolises the mixed cultural heritage of Spain. And its name still resonates. Twenty-one years after the death of Franco, the country is in transit: to full maturity, to a generation beyond Francoist Spain, to a new role in Europe. 
In El Greco's day, Spain was the world's greatest imperial power, ruled by a gloomy Philip II from a spartan study in the Escorial palace north of Madrid. But it frittered away its American wealth, skipped the Reformation, lost most of its European possessions, and was edged out of influence and power by France and England. It had an awful 19th century in which it mislaid its South American colonies and missed out on Europe's industrial revolution. A series of military coups and half-baked civil wars culminated in the disastrous year 1898, when it lost a war to the United States, along with its last big colony, Cuba. 
The first half of the 20th century was little better, though it did see the start of industrialisation. But the civil war in 1936-39 ruled out further progress. And after the war, the caudillo put the country into a kind of suspended animation, consigning it to a perpetual waiting-room. Not in every sense: it was Franco who presided over Spain's fastest period of growth (although few of the country's eager democrats like to admit it), the 15 years after 1959 that became known as the ""years of development"". In 1975, when Franco died, Spain's GDP per head was nearly 78% of the European average; two decades later, after a dramatic fall followed by a somewhat slower recovery, it still stands just below that level, at around 76% (see chart 1 on the next page). Yet in social and political terms, at the end of the Franco era Spain was a thoroughly backward place. 
No longer. Madrid and Barcelona are today as vibrant a pair of cities as any in the world, never mind Europe. Spanish society too has changed. Women play a bigger part than they did, the church and the army a smaller one. Mobile telephones bleep everywhere. The family still matters, but even in Spain it is beginning to lose out to the claims of the individual. Single parents, divorce, contraception, homosexuality, drug abuse and AIDS, unheard-of or heavily frowned on in Franco's day, have become commonplace. In short, Spain has become a fairly normal European country. 
Growing up 
Politics too has grown up. After presiding over Spain's ""first transition"" to democracy in 1977, Adolfo Suarez's centrist government was in turn displaced in 1982 by the Socialists under Felipe Gonzalez. He stayed in power for nearly 14 years, albeit towards the end as head of a minority government dependent on the support of Catalan nationalists. But last March Mr Gonzalez narrowly lost a general election to Jose Maria Aznar's People's Party (PP), although since Mr Aznar failed to win an absolute majority, he too had to negotiate a pact with the Catalans before taking office in May. 
These two peaceful transfers of power, from centre to left and then from left to right, suggest that Spanish democracy has come of age. The dreadful day in February 1981 when a pistol-waving colonel took over the Cortes, Spain's parliament, and democracy might have been lost but for the quickthinking new king, Juan Carlos, now seems remote indeed. These days, visitors to the Cortes are shown the bullet-holes as just another memento of a longdistant past. 
The arrival of Mr Aznar as prime minister did more than produce a shift to the right. It also brought to power a new generation of thirty- and fortysomethings, most of whom were students when Franco died. In that sense, the portentous title ""The Second Transition"" that Mr Aznar gave to a book he published in 1994 may have been justified. Yet in other ways it seems overblown. Most of his policies-fiscal tightening to qualify for the first stage of European economic and monetary union (EMU), privatisation of state-owned industries, full membership of NATo-continue rather than break with those of his predecessor. 
In retrospect, and despite the stench of corruption that polluted the closing years of Mr Gonzalez's government, it is hard not to be impressed by his achievements. Although a socialist on paper, he initiated Spain's shift away from the corporatist, heavily regulated structure bequeathed by Franco and towards a more free-market economy. He took Spain into the European Community and kept it in NATO. He began the restructuring and privatisation of state-owned enterprises, and started on the long haul of deregulating the labour market. And he did all this in the face of fierce opposition from the trade unions (which staged three general strikes in the 198os) and from many in his own party. 
Yet Mr Gonzalez also left a legacy of uncured ills. Many of them are felt in the rest of Europe too: lack of competitiveness, high non-wage labour costs, structural rigidities and excessive regulation both of labour and of product markets. Nor does Spain have a monopoly on rising public debt, high budget deficits, untamed inflation and an overly generous welfare state. As the country presses towards EMUthe prime objective of Mr Aznar's governmentthese ailments will hold it back. 
Other ills are peculiar to Spain; or are, at least, more virulent than elsewhere. Spain's capital markets remain underdeveloped. It has too few big home-grown multinationals. It needs to find a better way of coping with its 17 increasingly autonomous regions. And even though its politics has come of age, it still looks immature: the Cortes is feeble, and political parties have tended to become one-man bands. To some extent, Mr Gonzalez ran his government as if he were just another caudillo. 
Spain also faces two enormous challenges that no recent government has been able to tackle. One is unemployment, the highest among rich industrial countries. The second is its birth rate, one of the lowest in the world, which will lead to an accelerating decline in population in the next century. 
Set all this in the context of impending EMU, and this survey's two main themes naturally emerge. One is that, although most Spaniards seem eager to board the EMU train, few have any notion of what life will be like at their destination. The second is that, if Spain is to get to that destination in halfway reasonable shape, it has plenty of restructuring and modernising to do to its economy and, to a lesser extent, its politics and its society. 
What also emerges alongside these two themes is a big worry. If these reforms are to succeed, they must be sold to the Spanish people as a necessary sacrifice for the future; yet Spain's politicians-of all colours-are much keener on consensus and stability than on confrontation or calls for sacrifice. If it can find somebody prepared to push through reforms even at the cost of unpopularity, Spain should be set fair for the future. But if it fails to reform, the outlook is much less promising. The country might once more find itself marginalised at the far end of Europe. ","Spain has travelled a long way in the 21 years since Franco .

Nor does Spain have a monopoly on rising public debt , high budget deficits , untamed inflation and an overly generous welfare state . As the country presses towards EMUthe prime objective of Jose Maria Aznar's governmentthese ailments will hold it back . 
 Other ills are peculiar to Spain ; or are , at least , more virulent than elsewhere . Spain 's capital markets remain underdeveloped . It has too few big home - grown multinationals . It needs to find a better way of coping with its 17 increasingly autonomous regions . And even though its politics has come of age , it still looks immature : the Cortes is feeble , and political parties have tended to become one - man bands . To some extent , Mr Gonzalez ran his government as if he were just another caudillo . 
 Spain also faces two enormous challenges that no recent government has been able to tackle . One is unemployment , the highest among rich industrial countries . The second is its birth rate , one of the lowest in the world , which will lead to an accelerating decline in population in the next century . 
 Set all this in the context of impending EMU , and this survey 's two main themes naturally emerge . One is that , although most Spaniards seem eager to board the EMU train , few have any notion of what life will be like at their destination . The second is that , if Spain is to get to that destination in halfway reasonable shape , it has plenty of restructuring and modernising to do to its economy and , to a lesser extent , its politics and its society . 
 What also emerges alongside these two themes is a big worry . If these reforms are to succeed , they must be sold to the Spanish people as a necessary sacrifice for the future ; yet Spain 's politicians - of all colours - are much keener on consensus and stability than on confrontation or calls for sacrifice . If it can find somebody prepared to push through reforms even at the cost of unpopularity , Spain should be set fair for the future . But if it fails to reform , the outlook is much less promising . The country might once more find itself marginalised at the far end of Europe .",230,Spain,A29-4231,IN TERM,True,Jose Maria Aznar 's,15,True
1996-12-14,https://www-proquest-com.proxy.uchicago.edu/abicomplete/docview/224113856/fulltext/49D8C00DA394773PQ/73?accountid=14657,"""CONVERGENCE"" has been a key word in Spain's recent history. The failure of the country's income per head to converge with the rest of Europe in the past two decades was humiliating, particularly coming after the gains of the 196os. Enthusiasts for democracy may accept it as the price of transition, but it was more than that. It also reflected policy mistakes, including a misguided response to two oil shocks, excessive public spending and borrowing, and structural rigidities that helped to make the recession of 1994-95 worse than in the rest of Europe. 
Oddly, however, the big economic issue now is not how to remedy these faults. It is whether Spain can pass a new test of convergence: meeting the Maastricht criteria for EMU, to be applied in early 1998 to its performance in 1997 (see table 2 on the next pages Mr Aznar is categorical: ""I am absolutely confident that Spain will be part of EMU from the beginning, and that it will stay inside afterwards."" In September, he rejected a suggestion by Italy's prime minister, Romano Prodi, that theyjoin forces to seek either more flexibility in the Maastricht criteria or a delay in the project. 
The government's 1997 budget, including a pay freeze for public-sector workers and a 20% cut in public investment, was explicitly designed to keep the budget deficit below the Maastricht ""reference value"" of 3% of GDP. Spain is only a shade over the 600/oo%-of-GDP ceiling on public debt imposed by the criteria. As for inflation, the government can probably use its control of utility prices to keep within the limit (of no more than 1.5 percentage points above the EU's best three) in 1997. In November the European Commission gratifyingly forecast that Spain would just about meet the criteria. The financial markets seem to agree: they have reduced the dif ferential of Spanish over German ten-year bonds from 3.5 points in March to 1.5 points today. 
None of this means that qualification for EMU will be just a formality. Although the economy is doing reasonably well at the moment, the assumption in the budget that growth in 1997 will be 3% looks optimistic; most outside forecasts put it around half a point lower. The budget arithmetic contains a variety of dubious sums. Borrowing by some state-owned entities has been smuggled off the books, privatisation proceeds (which are not supposed to count for Maastricht) have been used to finance losses by other state-owned firms, and prospective losses by a third group of state-owned firms have not been included at all. The social-security deficit is likely to be bigger than the government predicts, and so is borrowing by the regions. In short, a more realistic forecast of the budget deficit for 1997 might be around 4%. 
Papering over cracks 
Yet the most serious fault of the budget is not that, on a strict interpretation, it looks likely to miss the 3% Maastricht limit-after all, France and even Germany may miss it too. It is that its heavy reliance on one-off measures and accounting tricks to get the deficit down for a single year does too little to improve the long-term health of Spain's public-sector finances. Indeed, some of the measures meant to shrink the 1997 deficit may inflate it in later years. 
The budget leaves untouched around three-quarters of ""pre-committed"" spending in areas such as welfare and pensions. Public spending has risen from around 30% of GDP in 1977 to over 45% now, and public debt has grown faster still (see chart 3); the Aznar government has few ideas for cutting either. Nor does it have plans for tax reform, which Spain (with a top marginal income-tax rate of 56%) is sorely in need of. 
Rodrigo Rato, Mr Aznar's polished finance minister, rejects such criticisms. He says the budget includes a lot of measures that will last, and points particularly to big improvements in budgetary control. He concedes that Spain needs further structural reforms, for instance to health care, pensions and the tax system, but says he cannot fight all the lions at once. Meanwhile, his Socialist opponent, Jose Borrell, brands the budget as ""unrealistic, unsustainable and unfair"". He criticises the cuts in inheritance tax and capital-gains tax that the government introduced in June, which he says will cost four times as much as the savings from the publicsector pay freeze. And he attacks the cuts in public investment, observing that Spain ""cannot afford ten years of fiscal austerity."" 
Mr Borrell may be right that Spain still needs substantial investment in infrastructure. But his broad conclusion is wrong. Spain's history can be told in terms of fiscal imprudence. Even in its glory days when fleets full of American treasure were docking every year at Seville, finances were a shambles. Between 1557 and 168o the crown went bankrupt eight times. More recently, coups and wars have undone bankers and bond-holders. One of Franco's achievements was to contain public spending and debt; since his death, both have bounced back with a vengeance. Even Mr Gonzalez now concedes that there is ""some truth"" in the claim that his government overspent. 
Nor is public finance the only Maastricht criterion to cause concern. Spain's inflationary record too is unimpressive (see chart 4). For a time, it seemed that its inflation was at last converging on the EU average, but recently the gap has grown again because inflation has fallen faster in the rest of Europe than in Spain. One-off measures may enable the government to pass the Maastricht test, but long-term convergence could prove elusive. 
It is little wonder that Hans Tietmeyer, president of Germany's Bundesbank, is issuing dire warnings against allowing countries into EMU that have only just met the criteria, thanks to one-offs and other window-dressing. Mr Aznar says sweetly that Mr Tietmeyer could not possibly intend such comments to apply to Spain; he also observes that it will be heads of government who have to decide on this matter and that, unlike some, he will not comment on other countries' efforts to qualify. Yet despite the financial markets' enthusiasm, plenty of people in Madrid still doubt whether the Germans are genuinely prepared to admit Spain from the start (although they are more confident that the French want them in, partly to make France herself less vulnerable). 
What's Spanish for Euroscepticism? What few Spaniards bother to ask is whether EMU membership will actually be good for Spain. All political parties apart from the far left are committed to it. For most, the issue is not about economics but about whether Spain is to be in Europe's first or second division; as Mr Borrell says, ""once you use a football analogy, it's decided."" Revealingly, politicians often talk about ""joining Europe"", not ""joining EMu"". And as one minister observes,joining Europe is something Spain has been trying to do for 8oo years. Spaniards' standard response to doubts about EMU's benefits is that even if they are not clear yet, being left out would certainly be much worse. Hardly anyone worries about giving up the peseta; Mr Gonzalez argues that ""EMU is a way of recovering sovereignty, not losing it."" 
Miguel Boyer, who was Mr Gonzalez's first finance minister and later helped to draw up the EMu blueprint, is one of the few who now express reservations. His view has been coloured by Spain's experience after joining the European exchangerate mechanism in 1989. The peseta went in at the relatively high rate of 64 to the -mark, but inflation took a long time to converge towards average European levels, and the system turned out to be semi-fixed. The resuit was a devastating loss of competitiveness which exporters and the tourist industry have not forgotten to this day; and when the strains proved too great to bear, the peseta was devalued four times in three years (see chart 5). 
Mr Boyer thinks that few of the businessmen clamouring to get into EMU really understand its implications. There has certainly been little discussion of life inside EMU. Indeed, Spanish politicians, by suggesting that getting into EMU will require some sacrifices but, once inside, life should become easier, may be risking a back-lash later. In reality, EMU will surely make life harder by removing the easy options of loose monetary and fiscal policies and frequent devaluations. 
This could be a good thing. Indeed, the more persuasive EMU enthusiasts argue that it is desirable precisely because it will force Spain to embark on structural reforms. Carlos Solchaga, finance minister from 1985 to 1993, argues that the things Spain has to do to thrive inside EMU are things it needs to do anyway. However, once inside EMU, it will have to do them more quickly than before. If all goes according to plan, Spain might be a member within two years. Yet the government has not even begun to prepare the ground for the extensive reforms to the labour market and to the social-security, pension, health and welfare systems which most economists consider essential if the economy is to remain competitive. 
This is all the more worrying since Spain desperately needs a sustained period of faster growth than the rest of Europe. It needs it not just because it still has to ""converge"" further, but also because Spain starts with a huge blot on its economic escutcheon: chronic unemployment.

HE figures are astonishingly bleak. On internationally accepted definitions, Spain's unemployment rose from a low point of 5.1% in 1977 to a high of 23.8% in 1994-about the same as America's peak in the 1930s. The current figure for Spain is 22.3% (see chart 6 on the next page). And this, remember, is an average. In regions such as Andalusia and Extremadura, a third of the workforce is unemployed. Among young people, too, the rate is horrific: the latest estimate for the under-25s is over 40%. Half of the unemployed have been out of work for a year or more, and have therefore become increasingly detached from the labour market. 
Many people's first reaction to such figures is disbelief If you travel around Spain, life goes on, people look happy, there are few protests. Politicians do not even make unemployment their top priority. So are the figures wrong? For comfort, people point to the numbers actually registered as unemployed, recently below 15% compared with the more widely quoted labour-force survey's 22%. They also reckon that a large underground economy probably cuts genuine unemployment by another few points, to a more tolerable lo% or so. 
Depressingly, though, academic research on Spanish unemployment, of which there has been plenty, suggests that it is the optimists who are wrong*. The labour-force survey appears to exaggerate joblessness by only two or three points. Moreover, there are reasons for thinking that Spain has some hidden unemployment as well. 
Consider the figure for employment rather than unemployment. In 1995 it was barely above the level it had been in 1965. Not that the jobs were exactly the same; over those 30 years, the proportion of the workforce employed in farming and fishing fell from 3o% to just under lo%, as many people moved off the land. But many of the new jobs they moved into were in the public sector. The Spanish private sector has consistently failed to create enough new jobs. 
As for the registered-unemployment figure, most statisticians reject it for three reasons: it is based on a smaller sample than the labour-force survey; it has been redefined many times so as to minimise the numbers (hence its recent divergence from the labour-force survey figures); and it does not reflect the fact that a growing number of longterm unemployed, especially women, who are no longer entitled to benefits, do not register. The labour-force survey, for its part, tries to capture the underground economy as well as the official one. And two other factors tend to underplay unemployment rather than exaggerate it: the lowest labourforce participation rate in Europe, and an unusually large number of ""students"" (nearly as many as Germany, which has twice the population). 
In short, the evidence points to a real figure for Spanish unemployment of around 20%. Why is it so high, and what can be done about it? 
The price of inflexibility Part of the answer is macroeconomic Growth has not been fast enough; hence the conclusion that Spain needs a sustained period of faster growth than the rest of Europe. But a bigger share of the responsibility lies with a panoply of rules that have made Spain's labour market one of the most rigid in the world. 
For example, firing people is enormously costly in Spain. Firms often have to seek permission from the government before introducing large-scale redundancies; and they have to make minimum severance payments that can mean more than three years' wages. In practice, they often pay even more than the minimum to avoid going to court, where employers lose in three-quarters of cases. All these rules deter employers from recruiting. 
To solve this problem, the Gonzalez government in 1984 introduced the concept of ""temporary contracts"", followed by further reforms in 1994. Nearly a third of Spanish employees are now on temporary contracts. These have indeed made the labour market more flexible, but with two perverse side-effects. One is high churning: to avoid turning a temporary job into a permanent one, firms often get rid of perfectly satisfactory temporary workers and hire new ones. A second, more pernicious, effect is to create a two-tier labour market: insiders with permanent contracts and outsiders without. Because insiders are insulated from any risk of losing their jobs, even high unemployment will not moderate their wage demands. In economists' language, this has pushed up Spain's NAIRU (the non-accelerating inflation rate of unemployment, ie, the amount of joblessness required to prevent inflation from rising), which some people now put as high as 16-17%. 
A statutory minimum wage and relatively generous unemployment benefits also serve to keep joblessness high. According to one study, 40% of unemployed people who were not receiving benefits found a newjob within three months; the figure for those on benefits was only 18%. The system is paid for by heavy employment and other taxes that add some 33% on top of wages. This ""wedge"" is over twice as thick as in Britain or Portugal, where unemployment is about a third of the Spanish level. 
Labour mobility between regions in Spain is now about a tenth of its level in the 196os. There is even net immigration into the region with the highest unemployment, Andalusia. Joblessness there is aggravated by national wage bargaining, which covers three-quarters of workers and keeps local wages higher than justified by local conditions. Andalusia and Extremadura also suffer from the PER, a government make-work scheme for any farmworker who has been employed for a minimum of 4o days in any year. Javier Arenas, Spain's employment minister, who is an Andalusian, says the PER ""has leached away entrepreneurship""; it also attracts migrant workers. 
It would be simple enough for the government to cure these faults by scrapping almost all labourmarket regulation. But in politics, simple is rarely easy. The trade unions resisted even the limited flexibility introduced by the reforms of 1984 and 1994, although they have demonstrably improved Spain's recent employment performance. The new government wants further reform to be based on consensus between employers and unions. Mr Rato, the finance minister, says there is ""room for common sense in further reform"". Mr Arenas insists that ""labour reform is essential; there is agreement that it is needed; the only disagreement is about how to do it"" He also gives warning, however, that ""the existence of dialogue does not preclude the possibility of confrontation; agreement and discord are not, in this case, incompatible."" 
Yet whatever Mr Arenas may say, it remains hard to see the government taking on the unions to force through radical labour reforms. Too many ministers are anxious to avoid the labour troubles that afflicted Mr Gonzalez and, more recently across the border, President Chirac in France. Indeed, Mr Arenas has made the PER even more accessible by cutting the qualifying period to only 35 days. And no minister seems willing to launch a serious attack on the welfare state. Mr Aznar has just proudly signed a pact with the unions that preserves the real level of pensions, which are among the most generous in Europe. Even Mr Rato talks only of making the welfare state more efficient, not of shrinking it. 
Family matters How does Spanish society cope with mass unemployment? Mainly by harnessing the strength of the family.Young unemployed people and students of ten live at home with their parents. Households are large, and generally contain at least one person in work. Unsurprisingly, opinion surveys show that many Spaniards rank their family as the most important thing in their lives. Fewer people live alone than in any other European country. Only 6% of families with children under 15 are headed bya single parent. Strong families go a long way to explaining how Spain has coped not just with unemployment but also with broader social strains. 
Yet the family is coming under pressure. Spain, it turns out, is just as susceptible as other countries to ills of modern societies such as divorce, family break-up and single parenthood. It also has Europe's highest incidence of drug abuse and AIDS. The church remains more powerful than in many other countries-recently the bishops won headlines for denouncing the flamboyant wedding of the deputy prime minister, Alvarez Cascos, because he was a divorc6-but Spain is becoming increasingly secular. And it faces a new difficulty: a declining population. 
Because of the country's low birth rate, the present number of Spaniards-some 39m-is due to start declining after around 2010, slowly at first but then faster and faster; by the middle of the next century, on some projections, the population could be below 3om, less than it was in 1951. That will mean a shrinking working population supporting an ever bigger generation of pensioners. It will also bring smaller families, and more social strains if high unemployment persists. 
Rural retreat Those strains will be felt most keenly in rural Spain. Farming still employs more than a tenth of the workforce in regions such as Extremadura, Castile La Mancha and Murcia. As farm subsidies are cut, that will decline. So far Spain has done well out of the EU'S common agricultural policy. But as Loyola de Palacio, the feisty PP agriculture minister, complains, the CAP still favours such northern products as dairy and cereals over Spanish wine, fruit and vegetables, and olive oil. The minister is fighting against changes in support payments for olive oil, and resisting pressure to let more products from North Africa into the EU. 
In a northern crescent of Castile stretching from Leon down to Cuenca, the rural population has been falling, sometimes by as much as 5% a year. In Castile La Mancha, soil and climate support little but vineyards, which the EU wants to grub up. And although empty rural Spain looks appealing, it needs people to look after it Spain has more forest fires than the rest of Western Europe put together. Water shortages make things worse. Parts of the country are at risk of turning into near-desert. 
Spain still has the largest fishing fleet in Europe, though Ms de Palacio claims it has sharply reduced its capacity in recent years. To British fishermen who complain about Spanish fishing vessels hoovering up ""their"" fish and buying up British quotas, she retorts that Spain, a country of fish-eaters, is by far their biggest market.Yet fishing villages along the north coast, like farms in the south and centre, are destined to lose many more jobs. 
What can be done to find Spain's rural population other jobs, particularly when general unemployment is already so high? The main answer is faster growth and deregulation. But the quality of labour also needs improving, which means more and better training and education. Education, in fact, has been one of Spain's great successes of the past 20 years. Until the mid-1970s few Spaniards even went to secondary school, let alone university. But since Franco, spending on education has risen from just under 2% of GDP to over 5%. The schoolleaving age has been lifted, most recently to 15. And Spanish universities have blossomed: the number of students has gone up from half a million two decades ago to 1.3m now. 
All this sounds impressive, but the new education minister, Esperanza Aguirre, may be right to complain that ""although spending is up, the results are not."" Education in Spain suffers from many-of the same defects as in the rest of Europe: overmighty trade unions, a woolly curriculum (Mrs Aguirre grumbles that history and geography have been replaced by ""social studies"") and insufficient parental choice. As for the universities, some have simply grown too big: Madrid's Complutense University, for instance, has 130,ooo students. Spain needs to impose more rigour on its ramshackle system of education if it is to raise the quality of its workforce. Spanish industry, for one, will increasingly demand this.

But many of the new jobs they moved into were in the public sector . The Spanish private sector has consistently failed to create enough new jobs . 
 As for the registered - unemployment figure , most statisticians reject it for three reasons : it is based on a smaller sample than the labour - force survey ; it has been redefined many times so as to minimise the numbers ( hence its recent divergence from the labour - force survey figures ) ; and it does not reflect the fact that a growing number of longterm unemployed , especially women , who are no longer entitled to benefits , do not register . The labour - force survey , for its part , tries to capture the underground economy as well as the official one . And two other factors tend to underplay unemployment rather than exaggerate it : the lowest labourforce participation rate in Europe , and an unusually large number of "" students "" ( nearly as many as Germany , which has twice the population ) . 
 In short , the evidence points to a real figure for Spanish unemployment of around 20 % . Why is it so high , and what can be done about it ? 
 The price of inflexibility Part of the answer is macroeconomic Growth has not been fast enough ; hence the conclusion that Spain needs a sustained period of faster growth than the rest of Europe . But a bigger share of the responsibility lies with a panoply of rules that have made Spain 's labour market one of the most rigid in the world . 
 For example , firing people is enormously costly in Spain . Firms often have to seek permission from the government before introducing large - scale redundancies ; and they have to make minimum severance payments that can mean more than three years ' wages . In practice , they often pay even more than the minimum to avoid going to court , where employers lose in three - quarters of cases . All these rules deter employers from recruiting . 
 To solve this problem , the Gonzalez government in 1984 introduced the concept of "" temporary contracts "" , followed by further reforms in 1994 . Nearly a third of Spanish employees are now on temporary contracts . These have indeed made the labour market more flexible , but with two perverse side - effects . One is high churning : to avoid turning a temporary job into a permanent one , firms often get rid of perfectly satisfactory temporary workers and hire new ones . A second , more pernicious , effect is to create a two - tier labour market : insiders with permanent contracts and outsiders without . Because insiders are insulated from any risk of losing their jobs , even high unemployment will not moderate their wage demands . In economists ' language , this has pushed up Spain 's NAIRU ( the non - accelerating inflation rate of unemployment , ie , the amount of joblessness required to prevent inflation from rising ) , which some people now put as high as 16 - 17 % . 
 A statutory minimum wage and relatively generous unemployment benefits also serve to keep joblessness high . According to one study , 40 % of unemployed people who were not receiving benefits found a newjob within three months ; the figure for those on benefits was only 18 % . The system is paid for by heavy employment and other taxes that add some 33 % on top of wages . This "" wedge "" is over twice as thick as in Britain or Portugal , where unemployment is about a third of the Spanish level . 
 Labour mobility between regions in Spain is now about a tenth of its level in the 196os . There is even net immigration into the region with the highest unemployment , Andalusia . Joblessness there is aggravated by national wage bargaining , which covers three - quarters of workers and keeps local wages higher than justified by local conditions . Andalusia and Extremadura also suffer from the PER , a government make - work scheme for any farmworker who has been employed for a minimum of 4o days in any year . Javier Arenas , Spain 's employment minister , who is an Andalusian , says the PER "" has leached away entrepreneurship "" ; it also attracts migrant workers . 
 It would be simple enough for the government to cure these faults by scrapping almost all labourmarket regulation . But in politics , simple is rarely easy . The trade unions resisted even the limited flexibility introduced by the reforms of 1984 and 1994 , although they have demonstrably improved Spain 's recent employment performance . The new government wants further reform to be based on consensus between employers and unions . Mr Rato , the finance minister , says there is "" room for common sense in further reform "" . Mr Arenas insists that "" labour reform is essential ; there is agreement that it is needed ; the only disagreement is about how to do it "" He also gives warning , however , that "" the existence of dialogue does not preclude the possibility of confrontation ; agreement and discord are not , in this case , incompatible . "" 
 Yet whatever Mr Arenas may say , it remains hard to see the government taking on the unions to force through radical labour reforms . Too many ministers are anxious to avoid the labour troubles that afflicted Jose Maria Aznar and , more recently across the border , President Chirac in France . Indeed , Mr Arenas has made the PER even more accessible by cutting the qualifying period to only 35 days . And no minister seems willing to launch a serious attack on the welfare state . Jose Maria Aznar has just proudly signed a pact with the unions that preserves the real level of pensions , which are among the most generous in Europe . Even Mr Rato talks only of making the welfare state more efficient , not of shrinking it . 
 Family matters How does Spanish society cope with mass unemployment ? Mainly by harnessing the strength of the family . Young unemployed people and students of ten live at home with their parents . Households are large , and generally contain at least one person in work . Unsurprisingly , opinion surveys show that many Spaniards rank their family as the most important thing in their lives . Fewer people live alone than in any other European country . Only 6 % of families with children under 15 are headed bya single parent . Strong families go a long way to explaining how Spain has coped not just with unemployment but also with broader social strains . 
 Yet the family is coming under pressure . Spain , it turns out , is just as susceptible as other countries to ills of modern societies such as divorce , family break - up and single parenthood . It also has Europe 's highest incidence of drug abuse and AIDS . The church remains more powerful than in many other countries - recently the bishops won headlines for denouncing the flamboyant wedding of the deputy prime minister , Alvarez Cascos , because he was a divorc6 - but Spain is becoming increasingly secular . And it faces a new difficulty : a declining population . 
 Because of the country 's low birth rate , the present number of Spaniards - some 39m - is due to start declining after around 2010 , slowly at first but then faster and faster ; by the middle of the next century , on some projections , the population could be below 3om , less than it was in 1951 . That will mean a shrinking working population supporting an ever bigger generation of pensioners . It will also bring smaller families , and more social strains if high unemployment persists . 
 Rural retreat Those strains will be felt most keenly in rural Spain . Farming still employs more than a tenth of the workforce in regions such as Extremadura , Castile La Mancha and Murcia . As farm subsidies are cut , that will decline . So far Spain has done well out of the EU 'S common agricultural policy . But as Loyola de Palacio , the feisty PP agriculture minister , complains , the CAP still favours such northern products as dairy and cereals over Spanish wine , fruit and vegetables , and olive oil . The minister is fighting against changes in support payments for olive oil , and resisting pressure to let more products from North Africa into the EU . 
 In a northern crescent of Castile stretching from Leon down to Cuenca , the rural population has been falling , sometimes by as much as 5 % a year . In Castile La Mancha , soil and climate support little but vineyards , which the EU wants to grub up . And although empty rural Spain looks appealing , it needs people to look after it Spain has more forest fires than the rest of Western Europe put together . Water shortages make things worse . Parts of the country are at risk of turning into near - desert . 
 Spain still has the largest fishing fleet in Europe , though Ms de Palacio claims it has sharply reduced its capacity in recent years . To British fishermen who complain about Spanish fishing vessels hoovering up "" their "" fish and buying up British quotas , she retorts that Spain , a country of fish - eaters , is by far their biggest market . Yet fishing villages along the north coast , like farms in the south and centre , are destined to lose many more jobs . 
 What can be done to find Spain 's rural population other jobs , particularly when general unemployment is already so high ? The main answer is faster growth and deregulation . But the quality of labour also needs improving , which means more and better training and education . Education , in fact , has been one of Spain 's great successes of the past 20 years . Until the mid-1970s few Spaniards even went to secondary school , let alone university . But since Franco , spending on education has risen from just under 2 % of GDP to over 5 % . The schoolleaving age has been lifted , most recently to 15 . And Spanish universities have blossomed : the number of students has gone up from half a million two decades ago to 1.3 m now . 
 All this sounds impressive , but the new education minister , Esperanza Aguirre , may be right to complain that "" although spending is up , the results are not . "" Education in Spain suffers from many - of the same defects as in the rest of Europe : overmighty trade unions , a woolly curriculum ( Mrs Aguirre grumbles that history and geography have been replaced by "" social studies "" ) and insufficient parental choice . As for the universities , some have simply grown too big : Madrid 's Complutense University , for instance , has 130,ooo students . Spain needs to impose more rigour on its ramshackle system of education if it is to raise the quality of its workforce . Spanish industry , for one , will increasingly demand this .

His lack of charisma is justly celebrated. Yet to get to the Moncloa palace, the new prime minister had to do something that previous right-wing leaders had failed to do: pull together three disparate strands of the Spanish right-rump Francoists, Christian Democrats and free-market liberals-into a single party. Moreover, last March he and his People's Party had to defeat a formidable opponent, Felipe Gonzalez. These achievements deserve considerable respect. 
So does Mr Aznar's response to the news that the PP was 20 seats short of an absolute majority (see table 7). To form a government, he had to put himself into the hands of the regional parties, notably the Catalan party, the ciu, led for 16 years by Jordi Pujol. That was awkward: not only had the ciu previously been allied with Mr Gonzalez's government (indeed, it was its defection that brought about the elections), but the PP had long been noisily hostile to any cession of power from Madrid to the regions. 
The PP was thus forced into a swift change of tack. Mr Aznar spent two months negotiating, not just with the Catalans, but also with the smaller Basque regional party, the PNv. The deal was struck at a hefty price: another increase in regional autonomy. The gains, however, were substantial. The agreement created a stable government in Madrid, it reconciled the Spanish right to decentralisation and, because the ciu is the most pro-business party in Spain, it gave economic policy a push in the right direction. 
Mr Aznar has assembled a broadly-based cabinet, including four women, a couple of members of Opus Dei, the Catholic sect, and such internationalists as Mr Rato and Abel Matutes, the foreign minister. He is quick to rattle off his achievements in his first six months: a smaller public administration, new budget discipline, tax changes that will encourage investment, land reforms and a start on liberalising telecoms, energy and the labour market. Yet beyond an overriding desire to qualify for EMU, it is hard to detect any driving vision. Is he a strong leader? Some say yes, but one colleague muses that it may be good for Spain to escape from the caudillismo that it often seems to drift into, and likens Mr Aznar to Britain's bland John Major. 
Many businessmen, having hoped for early tax cuts and faster deregulation, now express disappointment. Others are still nursing their hopes. A favourite scenario has the government calling an early election to win an absolute majority soon after it scrapes through the EMU test in April 1998. Then, the scenario continues, the government emerges in free-market colours, launching structural reforms in a manner worthy of Britain's doughty Margaret Thatcher. Although Mr Aznar says he wants to serve out his four-year term, Catalan regional elections due in 1999 may make Mr Pujol an unreliable ally nearer the time, and commend an early general election to the PP. 
Yet this scenario looks implausible, and not just because Spain may not qualify for EMU. The bigger reason is that it is Mr Aznar's own philosophy, not his minority-government status, that makes his embrace of free-market reform somewhat tepid. He talks a lot about ""consensus"" and ""stability"". His party includes plenty of free-marketeers, but he has not given them any key economic jobs. The pensions pact he recently concluded was criticised even by Socialists for being on the generous side. Asked whether he sees himself as a Kohl-like Christian Democrat or a Thatcherite conservative, Mr Aznar instantly replies: ""I am a centrist."" 
The other problem is that if the PP calls an early election, it might lose it. This is partly because the regional parties' strength makes it hard for either main party to get an absolute majority, but partly also because the Socialists still have huge popular appeal. The latest opinion polls give them a lead over the PP. 
Given the scandals that engulfed the party in its last couple of years in office, this resilience is surprising. Socialist leaders are embarrassed about the shady property deals, the dubious party financing and the corruption that festered under their noses, though most deny that it reached the top. Indeed, many insist that Mr Gonzalez is just the man to cleanse the party and restore it to power in the next election. Joaquin Almunia, the party's spokesman in the Cortes, predicts that 90% of party members will endorse Mr Gonzalez's leadership at its next congress. 
Gonzalez keeps going 
Mr Gonzalez has been inconspicuous since the election. Some people-including Mr Gutierrez, the union leader-are calling for a more forceful opposition and even a change of leadership. Mr Gonzalez retorts that it is early days and that he is not looking for disputes with the government. He notes smugly that he sets the agenda: ""When I venture an opinion, all national debate focuses on it."" 
And he seems determined to stay. Asked whether, after 22 years at the helm of his party and now aged 54, he would consider making way for a younger generation in the foreseeable future, he says: ""My generation already forced the previous generation into premature retirement. And Mitterrand was one year older than me when he first laid out his platform for subsequent success."" Mr Gonzalez shares Mr Aznar's dislike for ideology. Asked if he is a socialist, he says he has moved beyond ideological labels, though he admits to feeling a bit of a social democrat; he also loudly denounces freemarket ""fundamentalism"". 
One thing could yet oust Mr Gonzalez: the GAL affair. The GAL was a death squad that killed some 27 suspected Basque terrorists in the mid-1980s, and appeared to have links with the government. Several policemen and top Socialist politicians, including a former interior minister, have been charged with running the GAL; the suspicion persists that Mr Gonzalez must have known about it. The supreme court recently ruled that he should not be called to testify on the subject, but new evidence might yet emerge. The court's work was hampered by the government's refusal to release secret-service files. Indeed, the PP has seemed loth to embarrass the Socialists over the GAL Some suspect a deal between Mr Aznar and Mr Gonzalez, a charge they hotly deny. Mr Aznar observes that no government willingly opens intelligence files. Mr Gonzalez says he has never discussed the GAL with Mr Aznar. 
The GAL affair and, even more, the Socialists' corruption scandals have left a nasty smell in Spanish politics. They have revived doubts about the independence of Spain's political and legal institutions. The judiciary and the courts seem far too susceptible to outside influence. The Cortes is a feeble scrutiniser of government at best; its upper house, the Senate, does next to nothing. Even the king has not entirely escaped suspicions of involvement in some of the money scandals. Spain is not, its politicians proudly assert, like Italy; but its system still needs to mature. 
Assuming that Mr Gonzalez survives as Socialist leader, could he win the next election, whenever it comes? He might. Last March he did better than many had expected; he remains popular, especially in his native Andalusia; he is a forceful campaigner who can present himself as a European statesman with far more charisma than the grey Mr Aznar can ever aspire to. Socialists like to assert that Spain is naturally a country of the centre-left. But their task still looks formidable. 
It is made more difficult by the fact that the Spanish left, unlike the right, is divided. The Iu, a far-left party, still gets some 10% of the vote. Could the Socialists do a deal with it? Mr Almunia says that would be impossible, not just because the two parties disagree on Europe, the budget and NATO, but also because the Iu leader, Julio Anguita, is an unreconstructed communist. Yet if the left lost again (or if Mr Anguita stepped down), a realignment would be conceivable. That would dent the P's hopes of emerging as a natural governing party. 
Unless, that is, the PP too could do a deal with another party. The candidate staring it in the face is Mr Pujol's ciu, and not only because the PP is weak in Catalonia. Mr Pujol is another politician who dislikes ideological labels: he refuses to admit to being on the right or even centreright. Yet that is clearly where his party feels at home. Some in the PP have begun to look longingly at Germany, where the Christian Social Union in Bavaria has in effect merged with the Christian Democrats, yet retained its regional roots. A similar PP/ciu deal in Spain could put the centre-right more or less permanently in charge. Yet tensions between the government in Madrid and the Spanish regions make this unlikely.

1996-12-14,https://www-proquest-com.proxy.uchicago.edu/abicomplete/docview/224130969/fulltext/49D8C00DA394773PQ/77?accountid=14657,"PAIN, in area, is the second-biggest country in western Europe, with a rich regional variety to match. But its two most distinctive regions are the Basque country and Catalonia. The story of these two regions explains how Spain has become one of Europe's most decentralised countries. 
Despite its monolithic image, Spain has seldom been more than weakly united. In 1478 the Catholic monarchs, Ferdinand and Isabella, merged the crowns of Aragon and Castile, but their peoples remained distinct. Navarre and the Basque country for centuries retained their fueros, medieval laws giving them autonomy. Catalonia had its generalitat. The king found it hard to persuade these regions to raise taxes, and the resulting burden on Castile helped undermine Spain's finances. 
The country has also long been riven by internal strife. Catalonia, Navarre and the Basque country backed the losing side in the war of the Spanish succession. In the 19th century, this hostility revived in the Carlist wars. More recently, regional tensions were aggravated in the civil war. Franco suppressed the Catalan and Basque languages not just because he was a centralist, but also because Catalonia and the two Basque provinces of Vizcaya and Guipuzcoa fought so hard for the Republic. Indeed, he denounced Vizcaya and Guipuzcoa, where even priests were against him, as ""traitor provinces"". 
Not surprisingly, many Basques and Catalans responded by becoming even more nationalist. In the Basque country a terrorist organisation, ETA, was born in 1968. And when democracy came, the regions were swift to demand, and get, considerable autonomy. But the new government did not stop at Catalonia and the Basque country: in what became known as cafe para todos, the new constitution provided for 17 autonomous regions, each with its own government and parliament, though with differing degrees of power. 
When everyone has coffee, however, some may want something stronger for themselves. So it has proved in Spain. Political leaders such as Catalonia's Mr Pujol and the Basque country's Xabier Arzalluz deny that they watch other regions, and talk instead about their own historical and cultural identities. But in reality the Spanish regions are playing a game of leapfrog, forever seeking more powers than their rivals. Could it end in break-up? 
Canadian club No, says Mr Pujol. He visited Quebec last year, and says: ""I would be happy if I could obtain all that the Quebeckers enjoy today."" Unlike many Quebeckers, most Catalans do not want independence: although Mr Pujol prefers the word ""nation"" to ""region"", he also talks of staying ""within the framework of Spain"". He has a five-year deal with Mr Aznar to raise the proportion of locally raised income tax that Catalonia keeps from 15% to 30%. But he says that he ""will ask for more gradually."" 
Mr Pujol, an engaging polyglot 66-year-old who resembles one of the gargoyles that adorn the generalitat, may be Spain's cleverest politician. His refusal to accept an ideological label is tactical-he keeps his distance from both main parties so that he can float between them. His goals, he says, are to get Spain into EMU; to orientate economic policy towards what he quaintly calls the ""productive economy"" (as opposed to something he abhors, the ""financial economy""); and to ""develop the application of home rule to Catalonia"". Mr Pujol has enjoyed holding the balance of power in Madrid since 1993. Despite his age, he has no plans for retiring. The next Catalan election is due in 1999, and although the ciu has been slipping in the polls, it looks likely to remain in power. 
It helps Mr Pujol, no doubt, that economically Catalonia is Spain's most successful region. With only 13% of Spain's population, it accounts for nearly a fifth of GDP, a quarter of total exports and nearly two-fifths of industrial exports. Catalonia has always been more outward-looking than other Spanish regions. And Barcelona could claim to be Europe's most successful city. A new airport, a new seafront, new roads, thriving businesses, Spain's biggest savings bank-and the 1992 Olympics. Pasqual Maragall, the long-running mayor of the city who is standing down next year, boasts that Barcelona has the edge in its rivalry with Madrid. 
The biggest risk for Catalonia is that its insistence on the use of Catalan, for instance in its universities, might make the region too parochial. Some Spanish publishers have moved from Barcelona to Madrid. Mr Maragall, for one, recognises the risk, aware that much business deserted Quebec because of its insistence on French. He himself is a natural internationalist: his great-grandfather emigrated from Scotland to Jerez in Andalusia before the family moved to Barcelona. 
Basque bisque 
Would that the Basque country had so few problems. Language, in fact, is a smaller concern than in Catalonia. Although the Basques spend a fortune promoting it, there is less of a concerted attempt to foist Basque on its people-largely because half of them are non-Basque. Yet nationalist feeling is stronger in Bilbao than in Barcelona. 
The mainstream Basque nationalist party, the PNV, like the Catalans' ciu, has a deal with the PP. Jose Ardanza, the Basque president, who rules in coalition with the Socialists, emphasises that the party's support for Mr Aznar at national level is conditional on his ""fully implementing the 1979 statute of autonomy""-as laid down in a vote of the Basque parliament in October 1995. This implies more powers not just over taxation, but over training, labour laws, social security and pensions. At times, indeed, Mr Ardanza and his party leader, Mr Arzalluz, seem to want to push Madrid out of the picture altogether. 
Not least in security matters. The Basques' worst problem remains terrorist violence caused by ETA, which has claimed some 750 lives since it began in 68. Recently, however, there has been something of a lull. A number of ETA guerrillas have been caught in Spain and France.A few bombs go offand there are sporadic kidnappings. Otherwise the main action is a ""youth intifada"" in which teenagers hurl petrol bombs at the Basque police in the alleys of San Sebastian, a game that has become a spectator sport most Friday and Saturday evenings. 
Peace prospects 
Although the security situation has improved, ETA remains far from beaten. The guerrillas have much local backing; Herri Batasuna, their political wing, won ii% of the vote in the most recent regional elections, though its support is eroding. Spain's new interior minister, Jaime Mayor Oreja, observes that whenever ETA activity falls off, the demands of moderates-for example for Basque prisoners to be returned to their homeland-tend to become more vocal. The appointment of Mr Oreja, a Basque, is widely praised in PNV circles. Although most policing has been handed over to the Basque government, Madrid still plays a big role through the civil guard, intelligence and co-operation with the French government (which does not always work as perfectly as it might). 
What are the prospects for peace? Apparent progress in the Middle East and Northern Ireland has prompted the question whether negotiation with ETA might not prove fruitful. Yet it looks premature, mainly because ETA will not declare a ceasefire unless its wholly unrealistic conditions are met in advance. Basques also note that Northern Ireland and the Middle East now look fragile again. However, since their region is not riven by ethnic or religious divisions, many think that in the long run ETA should be less recalcitrant than the IRA or the Palestinians. Democratic Basque parties may be testing the waters already; asked how negotiations might begin, Mr Ardanza replies cryptically: ""In silence, without talking to journalists."" 
One use ul way of reducing popular support tor ETA would be economic growth. Yet the Basque country, though richer than most of Spain, is languishing. Unemployment is around 23%, as in the rest of the country. The regional government has an industrial policy, based on ""clusters"" in businesses such as machine tools and aerospace. It is experimenting with a lower corporation tax than in the rest of Spain. But it still relies too much on public subsidy, including for loss-making state-owned industries, and too little on the private sector. 
This is truer still for Spain's biggest region, Andalusia. Even though its coastline has been spoilt, Andalusia remains one of Spain's wonders: magnificent mountains and sky and, in the Alhambra in Granada and the Mesquita in Cordoba, Spain's finest architectural monuments. Yet its economy is a disaster. Unemployment is 33.3%; participation in the labour force a dismal 47.5% of the population. Agriculture, which provides one in seven Andalusian jobs, is only slowly recovering from this century's worst drought. 
When the Socialists were in power in Madrid, with an Andalusian prime minister, they poured money into the region: a high-speed train to connect Seville to Madrid, motorways and airports, Seville's Expo 1992. Yet the economy has little to show for it. Carlos Roman, head of Seville University's regional development institute, thinks two big mistakes were made. One was to build up industries in which the region has no comparative advantage, such as high-tech and computers. He suggests that agro-industry, tourism and the audio-visual business would do better. The second was to rely too much on the public sector. The classic case was Expo, financed with public money, and now a shell of empty buildings along the river Guadalquivir. 
Spain's regional policy remains of great interest to outsiders; Mr Maragall chairs Europe's committee of the regions. Yet although the policy seems broadly to have worked so far, things could still go wrong. Mr Gonzalez criticises the PPs income-tax concessions for creating, in effect, 17 different Spanish tax systems. ""The central government"", he insists, ""has an obligation to guarantee the cohesion of Spain.""And he worries about the cost Indeed the expense of the system could prove its worst failing. 
Enthusiasts retort that the price of running 17 different governments is worth paying, even for such tiny places as La Rioja, with a population of only 300,ooo. Worse, even as regional administrations mushroom, the central government in Madrid shows no sign of shrinking. When nearly a third of public spending is locally driven, the total is much harder to control. The PP government proclaims that its new financing deal will promote greater ""co-responsibility"", delivering more budget discipline. But it may have to change its mind if regional borrowing proves to be the final blow that scuppers Spain's chances of qualifying for EMU. ","PAIN , in area , is the second - biggest country in western Europe , with a rich regional variety to match . But its two most distinctive regions are the Basque country and Catalonia . The story of these two regions explains how Spain has become one of Europe 's most decentralised countries . 
 Despite its monolithic image , Spain has seldom been more than weakly united . In 1478 the Catholic monarchs , Ferdinand and Isabella , merged the crowns of Aragon and Castile , but their peoples remained distinct . Navarre and the Basque country for centuries retained their fueros , medieval laws giving them autonomy . Catalonia had its generalitat . The king found it hard to persuade these regions to raise taxes , and the resulting burden on Castile helped undermine Spain 's finances . 
 The country has also long been riven by internal strife . Catalonia , Navarre and the Basque country backed the losing side in the war of the Spanish succession . In the 19th century , this hostility revived in the Carlist wars . More recently , regional tensions were aggravated in the civil war . Franco suppressed the Catalan and Basque languages not just because he was a centralist , but also because Catalonia and the two Basque provinces of Vizcaya and Guipuzcoa fought so hard for the Republic . Indeed , he denounced Vizcaya and Guipuzcoa , where even priests were against him , as "" traitor provinces "" . 
 Not surprisingly , many Basques and Catalans responded by becoming even more nationalist . In the Basque country a terrorist organisation , ETA , was born in 1968 . And when democracy came , the regions were swift to demand , and get , considerable autonomy . But the new government did not stop at Catalonia and the Basque country : in what became known as cafe para todos , the new constitution provided for 17 autonomous regions , each with its own government and parliament , though with differing degrees of power . 
 When everyone has coffee , however , some may want something stronger for themselves . So it has proved in Spain . Political leaders such as Catalonia 's Mr Pujol and the Basque country 's Xabier Arzalluz deny that they watch other regions , and talk instead about their own historical and cultural identities . But in reality the Spanish regions are playing a game of leapfrog , forever seeking more powers than their rivals . Could it end in break - up ? 
 Canadian club No , says Mr Pujol . He visited Quebec last year , and says : "" I would be happy if I could obtain all that the Quebeckers enjoy today . "" Unlike many Quebeckers , most Catalans do not want independence : although Mr Pujol prefers the word "" nation "" to "" region "" , he also talks of staying "" within the framework of Spain "" . He has a five - year deal with Jose Maria Aznar to raise the proportion of locally raised income tax that Catalonia keeps from 15 % to 30 % . But he says that he "" will ask for more gradually . "" 
 Mr Pujol , an engaging polyglot 66 - year - old who resembles one of the gargoyles that adorn the generalitat , may be Spain 's cleverest politician . His refusal to accept an ideological label is tactical - he keeps his distance from both main parties so that he can float between them . His goals , he says , are to get Spain into EMU ; to orientate economic policy towards what he quaintly calls the "" productive economy "" ( as opposed to something he abhors , the "" financial economy "" ) ; and to "" develop the application of home rule to Catalonia "" . Mr Pujol has enjoyed holding the balance of power in Madrid since 1993 . Despite his age , he has no plans for retiring . The next Catalan election is due in 1999 , and although the ciu has been slipping in the polls , it looks likely to remain in power . 
 It helps Mr Pujol , no doubt , that economically Catalonia is Spain 's most successful region . With only 13 % of Spain 's population , it accounts for nearly a fifth of GDP , a quarter of total exports and nearly two - fifths of industrial exports . Catalonia has always been more outward - looking than other Spanish regions . And Barcelona could claim to be Europe 's most successful city . A new airport , a new seafront , new roads , thriving businesses , Spain 's biggest savings bank - and the 1992 Olympics . Pasqual Maragall , the long - running mayor of the city who is standing down next year , boasts that Barcelona has the edge in its rivalry with Madrid . 
 The biggest risk for Catalonia is that its insistence on the use of Catalan , for instance in its universities , might make the region too parochial . Some Spanish publishers have moved from Barcelona to Madrid . Mr Maragall , for one , recognises the risk , aware that much business deserted Quebec because of its insistence on French . He himself is a natural internationalist : his great - grandfather emigrated from Scotland to Jerez in Andalusia before the family moved to Barcelona . 
 Basque bisque 
 Would that the Basque country had so few problems . Language , in fact , is a smaller concern than in Catalonia . Although the Basques spend a fortune promoting it , there is less of a concerted attempt to foist Basque on its people - largely because half of them are non - Basque . Yet nationalist feeling is stronger in Bilbao than in Barcelona . 
 The mainstream Basque nationalist party , the PNV , like the Catalans ' ciu , has a deal with the PP . Jose Ardanza , the Basque president , who rules in coalition with the Socialists , emphasises that the party 's support for Jose Maria Aznar at national level is conditional on Jose Maria Aznar's "" fully implementing the 1979 statute of autonomy""-as laid down in a vote of the Basque parliament in October 1995 . This implies more powers not just over taxation , but over training , labour laws , social security and pensions . At times , indeed , Mr Ardanza and his party leader , Mr Arzalluz , seem to want to push Madrid out of the picture altogether . 
 Not least in security matters . The Basques ' worst problem remains terrorist violence caused by ETA , which has claimed some 750 lives since it began in 68 . Recently , however , there has been something of a lull . A number of ETA guerrillas have been caught in Spain and France . A few bombs go offand there are sporadic kidnappings . Otherwise the main action is a "" youth intifada "" in which teenagers hurl petrol bombs at the Basque police in the alleys of San Sebastian , a game that has become a spectator sport most Friday and Saturday evenings . 
 Peace prospects 
 Although the security situation has improved , ETA remains far from beaten . The guerrillas have much local backing ; Herri Batasuna , their political wing , won ii% of the vote in the most recent regional elections , though its support is eroding . Spain 's new interior minister , Jaime Mayor Oreja , observes that whenever ETA activity falls off , the demands of moderates - for example for Basque prisoners to be returned to their homeland - tend to become more vocal . The appointment of Mr Oreja , a Basque , is widely praised in PNV circles .

THE reason that Spain wants to get into EMU is clearly not economic but political. For centuries, Spain has been obsessed with its loss of power and its relegation to the fringes of Europe. Joining Europe's economic first division will, Spaniards hope, crown their efforts to re-establish Spain as a serious country. 
This obsession seems odd. Spain's real international strength is not military, political or economic: it is cultural. A key asset is its language, now the mother tongue of 3oom people around the world. Spanish is, indeed, the only real challenger to English as a world language. In many places, including North America and Europe, it is pushing aside French as the first foreign language people learn. And where English has become so universal that it is now barely identified with a single country, Spanish-a language with almost no dialects-has kent its link with the mother country. 
Spanish culture in the wider sense is also thriving. Spaniards have carved out well-respected positions in the worlds of film, design, painting and music. Bullfighting and flamenco dancing, both once expected to die, are flourishing. Theatre and literature are more dependent on imports: in late October the main theatres in Madrid, Bilbao and Barcelona were showing, respectively, Wilde's ""An Ideal Husband"",Agatha Christie's ""The Mousetrap"" and Tony Kushner's ""Angels in America"", while bookshops are packed with foreign books in Spanish translation. The country's vociferous arts lobby gets a less sympathetic hearing for its demands for subsidies from the pp government than it did from the Socialists. 
Apart from its language and culture, however, Spain has little left from its once-dominant world position. In Latin America, though it played a small part in the 1970s and 1980s in bringing democracy to the continent, it has been pushed aside by the United States. Mr Gonzalez cultivated a special relationship with Fidel Castro that Mr Aznar has junked in favour of demands for democratic reform. The more important agenda now is commercial, with big investments in Latin America by Telefonica, Iberia and several banks. But although Abel Matutes, the foreign minister, trumpets the fact that, for South America, Europe is a bigger trading partner than the United States, it is clear where the continent's economic and political interests lie. 
In North Africa and the Islamic world, too, Spain likes to think its history gives it a special role. Mr Matutes talks expansively about the need for Europe to play a bigger role in the Middle East-""our backyard"". But Mr Gonzalez, proud as he was to host the Madrid Middle East summit in 1991, stresses that Spain must stay close to America on this. And whether it likes it or not, Spain will be stuck with the awkward job of being Europe's first line of defence against illegal immigration and drug-smuggling from North Africa. 
Bullish in Brussels 
As for Europe, Mr Gonzalez certainly put Spain on the map, not least thanks to his close friendship with Germany's Helmut Kohl. How much clout Spain will carry under Mr Aznar will depend heavily on his success in getting into the first round of EMU. But even if he fails, Spain will continue to fight hard for its interests in Brussels-not least because it is determined to remain a big recipient of EU money, especially from the structural funds, af ter the next round of enlargement It will go on clashing with Britain over the future of Gibraltar, widely denounced in Spain as ""the last colony in Europe."" Never mind that the British themselves are keen to be rid of Gibraltar: unless opinion on the Rock changes in favour of accepting some kind of Spanish sovereignty, the argument will continue. 
In one respect, Spain's foreign role is likely to increase: military operations. Already Spanish troops have been deployed in the Gulf and in Bosnia. The new government plans to become a fully integrated member of NATo next year, after which foreign commitments may increase. That is one reason why the defence minister, Eduardo Serra, plans to phase out conscription in favour of a smaller, more professional and better equipped army. 
Yet such a transition will be hard to manage without more money. Mr Serra hopes to increase the defence budget from the present itz% of GDP to more like 2-212%; but given the government's efforts to qualify for EMu, his hope may prove forlorn. In the end, almost all issues in Spain come back to this one overriding goal. ","Spain is slowly reestablishing itself on the world stage

THE word ""liberal"", as a political label, was coined during the 19th-century dispute between reactionary Spanish Carlists and liberals. Yet for most of this century liberalism, in its classical sense, has been in short supply in Spain. It is this, above all, that the country needs; all the more so if it gets into EMU. 
Many people might retort that Spain is motoring along happily now; and that although it could do even better with a smaller public sector, lower taxes, a slimmer welfare state and more deregulation, the same is true of other European countries to which Spain will be linked through EMU. If Spain could become more like Germany or the Netherlands, say, that would be enough of a triumph, without any need for the free-market fundamentalism that Mr Gonzalez dislikes so much. 
Yet this is a false trail, for two reasons. The first is that Spain is too poor to afford other European countries' mistakes. Germans (at least western Germans) are rich enough to cope with the inefficiency, slow growth and high unemployment caused by a bloated welfare state and too much interventionism. Spaniards are not. That makes their need for freer markets much greater. 
The second reason is that other European countries are themselves beginning to change. Even consensus-seeking Germany is cutting public spending and deregulating to make itself more competitive. France, which some Spanish economists gleefully call ""the sick man of Europe"", may yet get there too. If Spain fails to follow suit, it could be dangerously exposed. And the longer it leaves it, the more difficult the adjustment will be. 
Who might be brave enough to start right away? The answer might have been expected to be the Pp. Some party members spent the years of opposition preparing a free-market programme, rather as Britain's Tories did under the Labour government in the late 1970s. But the PP's leadership had a different agenda: it was chipping away at Spanish fears that the old Francoist right might dismantle the welfare state. This gives the party a powerful historical reason to operate by consensus, as Mr Aznar temperamentally prefers to do. The trouble is that consensus is unlikely to bring forth painful reforms. 
In private, however, many politicians in both main parties agree that such reforms are necessary. Could they team up to push them through? Some people in Madrid talk wistfully of a ""grand coalition"" that might jointly do the deed, and share the blame, in the name of full accession to Europe and EMU. This would have the merit also of producing a government that for once did not depend on the support of the regional parties. Yet it is hard to see a grand coalition materialising under the leadership of Mr Aznar and Mr Gonzalez. 
Don't cry for me, Spain 
Is there an alternative? Spain could always look to its old empire for inspiration-say Chile, or better still Argentina, where Domingo Cavallo, President Carlos Menem's ruthlessly free-market economy minister, spent four years presiding over a programme that slashed inflation, deregulated the economy and privatised state-owned industriesbefore he was sacked last summer. True, Spain is not in as bad a shape as Argentina, but that should make the free-market treatment less painful. The trouble is that it could also make it harder to appoint a ministro combustible to administer it. 
Here, then, is an agenda for Mr Aznar. By all means press on to get Spain into EMU as early as possible. But having taken the credit for that, explain to the voters that it is time to go for growth (and at last get rid of unemployment); and that the way to do it is to make a bonfire of existing taxes and regulations. Next, identify Spain's Cavalloand be ready to toss him on the bonfire when his work is done. Mr Aznar may not, at present, seem the right man to convey the need for sacrifices to his voters. Five years ago, nor did Mr Menem. ","A bold freemarketeer would work wonders in Spain

At last someone in the new conservative government was getting married como dios manda-""as God decrees"". But if the bishops still think the country's new rulers will push Spain back into a closer embrace with the Catholic church, reinforcing ""family values"" and restoring clerical clout after 13 years of secularising socialism, they are likely to be disappointed. 
Not that Spain's new rulers are loth to marry. Mr Rajoy is the third minister to tie the knot since the People's Party took office last May. The first was Eduardo Serra, the defence minister (albeit not in the PP), who wed without great fanfare. 
The next ministerial nuptials were a fancier affair. Yet, far from giving fresh hope to the more traditional of Spain's bishops, they ended up by reminding them of their weakness. When a deputy prime minister, Francisco Alvarez Cascos, aged 49, married a woman 27 years his junior, his slap-up wedding was conducted in Cordoba's Moorish Alcazar fortress by the town's mayor. The Aznar family and most of the cabinet attended the lavish banquet and ball that followed. 
The snag, in the church's eye, was that Mr Cascos was a divorce with four children. ""Spanish Catholics would have preferred more discretion,"" declared one bishop. ""From the Christian point of view only the first wedding is valid,"" tuttutted another. ""What is legal is not always moral."" 
Such public episcopal frowning went down badly, however. Most Spaniards deemed the Cascos wedding to have been in poor taste, but they also, according to an opinion poll, reckoned the bishops were carping too much. The head of the Bishops' Conference, Monsignor Elias Yanes, had been inclined to hold his tongue, though he did later voice disapproval. Both he and Mr Aznar know that Spain's confessional state died with General Franco in 1975. 
Though about nine out of ten Spaniards declare themselves ""culturally Catholic"", less than half now attend mass regularly. The family may be Spain's ""most prized institution"", but Spaniards are now the most reluctant breeders in Western Europe. In the run-up to last year's general election, many people worried that the PP, with its rump of Catholic traditionalists of the Franco stamp alongside more modern-minded Christian Democrats and economic liberals, might try turning the clock back on moral issues. 
In fact, Mr Aznar has been characteristically cautious. True, he has put at least two members of the controversially conservative Opus Dei group in his cabinet; another has become speaker of parliament's more powerful lower house. He himself regularly attends mass. But he has not sought to impose his religious views. 
On the delicate question of abortion, for instance, he has trodden warily. He has scrapped the Socialists' plan to make it available during the first 12 weeks of pregnancy to anyone facing ""economic hardship""-in other words, virtually on demand. But nor has Mr Aznar tried to tighten the existing law, which allows the abortion of a severely malformed fetus; after rape; or if the mother's mental or physical health is ""in danger"". 
In general, Monsignor Yanes has been as pragmatic as Mr Aznar. He helped put the church on better terms with the Socialists. He takes care not to criticise politicians openly. Near the end of the Socialist government's term, he denounced corruption but singled out no party. In any event, by no means all Spain's clergy are ideological conservatives. 
When Mr Aznar took office, the monsignor said he thought the new prime minister would be ""better disposed"" to the church but that judgment should be reserved until several issues already under discussion, such as the importance of religious education in schools, were dealt with. Some of his fellow bishops do sound nostalgic, but Monsignor Yanes seems not only to accept a clear distinction between church and state but actually to welcome it. Such views hold more sway, these days, than those of the harkers back to the past. ","WHEN Mariano Rajoy , a worthy minister , walked up the aisle on December 28th , many of Spain 's bishops heaved a sigh of relief . At last someone in the new conservative government was getting married como dios manda-""as God decrees "" . But if the bishops still think the country 's new rulers will push Spain back into a closer embrace with the Catholic church , reinforcing "" family values "" and restoring clerical clout after 13 years of secularising socialism , they are likely to be disappointed . 
 Not that Spain 's new rulers are loth to marry . Mr Rajoy is the third minister to tie the knot since the People 's Party took office last May. The first was Eduardo Serra , the defence minister ( albeit not in the PP ) , who we d without great fanfare . 
 The next ministerial nuptials were a fancier affair . Yet , far from giving fresh hope to the more traditional of Spain 's bishops , they ended up by reminding them of their weakness . When a deputy prime minister , Francisco Alvarez Cascos , aged 49 , married a woman 27 years his junior , his slap - up wedding was conducted in Cordoba 's Moorish Alcazar fortress by the town 's mayor . The Jose Maria Aznar family and most of the cabinet attended the lavish banquet and ball that followed . 
 The snag , in the church 's eye , was that Mr Cascos was a divorce with four children . "" Spanish Catholics would have preferred more discretion , "" declared one bishop . "" From the Christian point of view only the first wedding is valid , "" tuttutted another . "" What is legal is not always moral . "" 
 Such public episcopal frowning went down badly , however . Most Spaniards deemed the Cascos wedding to have been in poor taste , but they also , according to an opinion poll , reckoned the bishops were carping too much . The head of the Bishops ' Conference , Monsignor Elias Yanes , had been inclined to hold his tongue , though he did later voice disapproval . Both he and Jose Maria Aznar know that Spain 's confessional state died with General Franco in 1975 . 
 Though about nine out of ten Spaniards declare themselves "" culturally Catholic "" , less than half now attend mass regularly . The family may be Spain 's "" most prized institution "" , but Spaniards are now the most reluctant breeders in Western Europe . In the run - up to last year 's general election , many people worried that the PP , with its rump of Catholic traditionalists of the Franco stamp alongside more modern - minded Christian Democrats and economic liberals , might try turning the clock back on moral issues . 
 In fact , Jose Maria Aznar has been characteristically cautious . True , Jose Maria Aznar has put at least two members of the controversially conservative Opus Dei group in Jose Maria Aznar's cabinet ; another has become speaker of parliament 's more powerful lower house . Jose Maria Aznar Maria Aznar regularly attends mass . But Jose Maria Aznar has not sought to impose Jose Maria Aznar's religious views .

1997-02-01,https://www-proquest-com.proxy.uchicago.edu/abicomplete/docview/224082526/fulltext/61A3A6A54EFB4BEDPQ/41?accountid=14657,"WHEN Spain's prime minister, Jose Maria Aznar, proclaimed 1997 ""employment year"", he was sending unions and employers a message: agree quickly on ways to loosen up the labour market or expect the government to impose its own reforms. That sounds tough,but may not turn out to be so. Indeed, Mr Aznar's penchant for compromise probably means employ ment year will in the end see few new jobs. 
The prime minister has reason to hurry. At 22%, Spain's unemployment rate is the highest in Western Europe; among under25s, the rate is 40%, though many of the registered jobless are actually working on the side. If, as Mr Aznar hopes, Spain joins Europe's single currency at the outset in 1999, it will no longer be able to devalue its currency as a job-making ploy. Spain, quite simply, must make it easier for private employers to hire and fire. 
The reform Mr Aznar has in mind will help, but only a little. At its core are new rules to make it easier for employers to sack workers on permanent contracts. At present bosses must pay 45 days' salary for each year of employment to workers ""unfairly"" dismissed; when dismissal is fair, severance pay falls to 20 days' salary for each year worked. The problem is that almost every dismissal is deemed unfair by the courts. In practice, that means that longserving but not necessarily brilliant workers have guaranteed jobs while younger, sometimes abler, ones can be easily shed. Unions and employers are near an agreement on a deal that would make it easier to sack workers fairly-for incompetence, say. That should encourage companies to hire workers on permanent contracts. 
But, as the price of this advance, Mr Aznar may have to dilute the one labour reform that has already helped create jobs: the introduction in 1984 of short-term contracts by the Socialist prime minister of the time, Felipe Gonzalez. Spaniards deride them as contratos basura (rubbish contracts), since they give no job security at all. They have created a two-tier labour market of older workers, with little incentive to be productive or restrain their pay demands, and younger ones who limp from one contract to another without building real careers. But they have created jobs; fully 97% of last year's new jobs were temporary. 
If sacking long-serving workers is to become easier, the unions will insist on making it harder to shed temporary ones. That is bound to cut the number of new temporary jobs, though it will improve the lot of those who get them, blurring the divide between the labour market's two tiers. The unions also want curbs on overtime to spread existing work among more people. Businessmen grumble, but reckon the compromise will, on balance, make more jobs. 
Balancing things is what Mr Aznar, a consensus-minded conservative, is all about. He is determined to avoid the general strikes that bedevilled the Socialists. He persuaded public-sector unions not to squeal too much about a wage freeze this year to help Spain qualify for the single currency. In return, he agreed with the unions to keep up the real value of pensions, among Europe's most generous. Even the Socialists thought Mr Aznar bent too far. 
Not surprisingly, the labour reform will not touch much of what gums up job creation. Nationwide collective-bargaining agreements for each industry will stay, making it hard for firms to tailor job conditions to their circumstances. So will the old employment scheme for farm workers which, the employment minister admits, ""has leached away entrepreneurship"" by keeping workers on the land. When the single currency comes, Mr Aznar may regret he did not push Spain faster.

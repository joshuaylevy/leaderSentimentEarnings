THEY claim to be inspired by the Arab spring, or the student uprising of May 1968 in Paris. But if you want a parallel for the anti-political protests that have swept across Spain, maybe it is to be found in Argentina in 2001-02, when years of recession ended in debt default and rowdy mobs shouted ""que se vayan todos"" (loosely, ""kick all the bums out"").
Fortunately, Spain is not Argentina--at least not yet. And the tens of thousands of mainly young Spaniards camped out in city squares have been impeccably well behaved. Even so, the protests may deter politicians from the grim task of saving Spain's economy from stagnation and banishing the fear of default. So may the crushing defeat inflicted on the ruling Socialist party of Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero by the conservative People's Party in regional and local elections on May 22nd (see
). Mr Zapatero was slow to face up to the bursting of the housing bubble, but over the past year he has pushed through spending cuts and some structural reforms. So the double rejection of his government has worried financial markets, already jumpy about resistance to austerity in Greece and Portugal. Spain, too big to bail out, matters still more. 
The surprise in the Spanish protests is that they didn't happen sooner. Youth unemployment is over 40%. Many young Spaniards live at home with parents who are themselves jobless and who may well be struggling to pay debts of their own. The protesters convey a mood more than a message. There is a faint echo of Spain's anarchist tradition in their anti-party, anti-union slogans, mixed with familiar anti-globalisation rhetoric. But there are two strands to their discontent that the politicians should listen to. 
First, the protesters have a point when they say that the political and media establishment has become aloof and self-serving. The politicians who crafted Spain's democratic institutions in the 1970s had good reasons for favouring strong parties and governability over perfect representation. The instability, fragmentation and polarisation that marked the last democratic experiment in the 1930s led to civil war and decades of dictatorship under General Franco. But the unintended result has been over-mighty and unaccountable party bosses. Corruption, though the exception, has often gone unpunished. So there is a case for looking at electoral reform, and especially at introducing an open-list system that would allow voters to pick and choose among individual candidates. Time for Rajoy to come off the fence
The second and bigger reason for the protests is that Spain's rigid two-tier labour market, bolstered by the unions, cossets the insiders who have permanent jobs at the expense of the young and unemployed, who are left out in the plazas. To his credit, Mr Zapatero has begun to cut the cost of hiring. He also wants to make collective bargaining more flexible. But more boldness is needed. Spain's best hope of growing its way out of its mess is through exports; given that membership of the euro means it can no longer devalue, that requires falls in the real value of wages.
Mr Zapatero wisely said this week that he would stick to his guns. But he is on the way out. His party quickly needs to choose a new leader, preferably Alfredo Perez Rubalcaba, the shrewd interior minister. As for the People's Party, it is savouring a return to power in elections due by March next year, even though its leader, Mariano Rajoy, has often been equivocal about reforms. With the local elections over, the protests will probably fizzle for a while. But Mr Rajoy should have no illusions. Unless he unveils radical plans to improve the lot of younger Spaniards, they will be back.","How to get the protesters out of the plazas and into jobs

MICHAEL BANKS, a child in the 1964 Disney musical, ""Mary Poppins"", is an unlikely hero for today's angry Spanish youth. But his face features on some of the thousands of posters pinned to the walls of Madrid's central Puerta del Sol square, where protesters have been camped out for almost two weeks. The reason? He demanded his tuppence back from the Dawes Tomes Mousley Grubbs Fidelity Fiduciary Bank, and started a run.
As Spain's ruling Socialists reeled from a ten-percentage-point defeat at the hands of the conservative People's Party (PP) in municipal and regional elections on May 22nd--the party's worst-ever result--some found explanations among the tented demonstrators in Madrid and dozens of other Spanish cities. It is not that the protesters--an ill-assorted mix of anti-capitalists, anarchists and pragmatists bothered about corruption and electoral imbalances--changed voters' minds. It is that they, and people like them, might normally have voted for left-wing parties. On May 22nd the Socialists lost 1.5m, or one in five, of their votes. Yet the communist-led United Left coalition picked up only 210,000. Likewise, Mariano Rajoy, the PP's leader, focused his party's election campaign on the economy and jobs, Spain's two main concerns, but the PP gathered only 560,000 of the spare votes. Its victory was due chiefly to disillusion with the left, not great advances on the right. 
Still, this was an historic drubbing. It is best measured by the record number of regional governments and city halls won by the PP. The party will now run between nine and 11 of Spain's 17 regional governments, and have an important say in several more. The Socialists are left in control of just Extremadura and two regions that did not vote--Andalusia and the Basque country. But all of Andalusia's provincial capitals, including traditionally Socialist Seville, are now in PP hands. 
A general election must be held by the end of next March. Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero, the Socialist prime minister, announced in April that he would not stand again, hoping, probably vainly, to save his party by acting as a lightning-rod for voter fury. Few now doubt that Mr Rajoy, on his third try, will move into the prime minister's Moncloa Palace. The question is whether he will land the holy grail of Spanish politics: a parliamentary majority. If repeated, the PP's ten-point lead over the Socialists on May 22nd should do--just. Anything less threatens to leave Mr Rajoy without a mandate for the reforms Spain badly needs. 
Mr Zapatero's popularity has proved inversely proportional to the wisdom of his decision-making. For two years he denied that Spain was in serious financial trouble. His support fell only slightly, despite recession and galloping unemployment. But last May, as contagion spread across the euro zone's periphery, he executed a U-turn, embracing austerity and, to a lesser degree, reform. His ratings plunged. 
Now the Socialists must choose a replacement for him. A bitter fratricidal battle is looming, with calls for an emergency party conference to remove him as secretary-general. If he loses control of his party, Mr Zapatero might be dumped as prime minister, or even have to call an early election, as the PP has urged. A party meeting on May 28th was due to set the course. Alfredo Perez Rubalcaba, the deputy prime minister, is the front-runner to replace Mr Zapatero after Carme Chacon declared on May 26th that she would not stand. He would not represent a big change in policy.
As his party grows more uneasy, Mr Zapatero is sticking to an austerity path that aims to reduce Spain's budget deficit from 11.1% of GDP in 2009 to 4.4% by the end of next year. The OECD, a think-tank, says he is on target. The political cost is becoming apparent. But if the Socialists think left-leaning voters abandoned them only because of spending cuts, reduced civil-service pay and pension reform, they should study the demographics of the Puerta del Sol's unhappy campers.
The protesters are mostly students. ""Most live with their parents. Their problem is the lack of a future,"" says Ignacio Sanchez-Cuenca of Madrid's Juan March Foundation, a research body. Spain's already-startling 21% unemployment rate rises to 45% among the young. Growth, at just 0.8% over the past year, remains sluggish. A decade-long bonanza of private borrowing, followed by a spurt in public borrowing when the crisis struck, has left a heavy debt burden. Discharging it may depress growth for years. The Economist's May poll of forecasters predicts growth this year of just 0.6%, followed by 1.1% in 2012. That will create few jobs.
Provisional economic figures released earlier in May contain some worrying details. A surprise upturn in public-sector spending--which increased by 1.1% in the first quarter of 2011 after four quarterly declines--raises questions about decentralised Spain's ability to cut its way to fiscal health. Angel Laborda of Funcas, a savings-banks body, says regional governments and town halls may have been using this year's budget to pay costs from 2010. That implies a hidden extra deficit. 
Many of these administrations are now in the PP's hands. Thorough scrutiny should reveal the true state of the books. The PP now has a good chance to show voters how it would run public finances. So far, its record is mixed. The Madrid region, long a PP bastion, has the lowest deficit of Spain's 17 regions. But PP-governed Murcia is one of the worst performers. 
Markets did not celebrate the PP's win. Bond yields rose and stocks fell, stoking fears that Spain's attempt to ""decouple"" itself from the problems of other peripheral euro-zone countries may be in trouble. Mr Rajoy has criticised Mr Zapatero's pension reform without offering an alternative. If he wants to take control of a country that is not in crisis he must become clearer about his plans for government.","Spain 's young want jobs , the markets want reform and voters want a new government

SPAIN will soon be a country for old men. Most new prime ministers are in their early 40s. But the next one will be a grey-bearded veteran. The choice will be between Alfredo Perez Rubalcaba, the Socialist deputy prime minister, who must lead his party into a tough general election due by next March, and Mariano Rajoy of the conservative People's Party (PP). The voters are set to choose Mr Rajoy. An image consultant's nightmare, the bespectacled Mr Rajoy is a dull candidate. He looks like a provincial land registrar--which, indeed, he was before embarking on a political career. He has twice lost elections: his party is bad at ejecting losing leaders. Yet he may win next time with an absolute majority.
Spaniards still complain they know too little about what the enigmatic 56-year-old will bring. Victory will go to him because the election will be lost, not won. The voters savaged the Socialists in municipal elections on May 22nd, giving the PP a record ten-point lead. They had reason to punish their Socialist prime minister, Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero. A once-booming economy crashed on his watch. Unemployment is over 21%, growth may be low for years, bond yields are high and deficit-cutting is causing real pain.
Mr Rajoy has played watch and wait, being careful not to frighten voters with dramatic, drastic proposals. He has shed the ""nasty party"" baggage that damaged the PP in 2008. He has abandoned overblown claims that Mr Zapatero is tearing Spain apart by giving more autonomy to its regions or destroying the family. PP hints that the region of Castilla-La Mancha is bust or that Spain's health system will not survive the year also look alarmist. Mr Rajoy also rarely mentions terrorism practised by the Basque separatist group ETA. Yet many in the party, especially on the right, wish he were more forthright and dynamic. Others offer the faint praise that he will be a better prime minister than opposition leader. Some blame Britain's David Cameron, a fellow conservative: Mr Cameron scared voters by being too open about austerity, they say, and failed to win an absolute majority. 
All this leads to frustration about the PP's plans. ""I don't think anyone really knows what he will do beyond balancing the budget, and that doesn't help calm markets,"" says Jesus Fernandez-Villaverde, an economist at the University of Pennsylvania. ""The degree of courage will depend on the size of the parliamentary majority,"" says Lorenzo Bernaldo de Quiros, of Freemarket International Consulting. That the PP now runs many regions may not help, as some voters may start to see it as an incumbent rather than an opposition.
Mr Rajoy is famed for a trait of his native Galicia: leaving people guessing about his real intentions. But he is also tenacious. Plots to dethrone him as leader have come to nothing. In a party that covers the spectrum of the Spanish right, somebody will always gripe. He and his economic team deny they are hiding their plans, pointing to numerous parliamentary motions. 
A Rajoy government will try to repeat the trick of the first PP government of Jose Maria Aznar after 1996. It met its deficit targets, cut taxes and enjoyed strong growth. Mr Rajoy will quickly pass an austerity package and cut corporate tax. He will push through more labour reform, with or without union consent. And he will hack at business-suffocating red tape. But this is not 1996. Spain has fewer public companies to privatise and cannot count so much on European Union money. How the Aznar model can apply now will depend largely on Mr Rajoy's first finance minister. And who will that be? Like so much surrounding Mr Rajoy, it remains a mystery.

THERE was no rock-throwing or tear gas, but on July 9th Spain's polite ""indignant"" protesters still chalked up a victory. After being endorsed as the ruling Socialist Party's candidate for prime minister in the election due by next March, Alfredo Perez Rubalcaba used his acceptance speech to propose electoral reform. This might not sound much. But Mr Rubalcaba's call for Spain to adopt Germany's voting model, so as to install proportional representation but still let people choose their local deputies, was a direct sop to the movement that spontaneously occupied city squares in mid-May, claiming that the politicians ""don't represent us"".
Nor is this the only success for los indignados (the indignants). Even as police manned the barricades outside parliament on June 21st, deputies were unanimously calling for a much-delayed bill on freedom of information. A week later the government agreed, and also announced new limits on the amounts banks can reclaim from mortgage defaulters. Both measures came after pressure from Europe's best-behaved protest movement.
Yet there were often more deputies inside parliament than protesters outside. Sometimes tens of thousands have turned up to the demonstrations; at other times, just a few dozen. Nobody can blame Spanish politicians for struggling to understand the movement. The indignants, who claim to have no leaders, are themselves unclear what they stand for. Their assembly-based, consensus-seeking debates are painfully slow. Manuel Chaves, a minister, likens their meetings to those of the bickering Peoples' Front of Judea in the Monty Python film ""Life of Brian"".
But politicians ignore the indignants at their peril. Up to 80% of Spaniards say they support the earnest young protesters. Even the occasional lapse into violence, such as a blockade of the Catalan parliament on June 15th, has done little to dent their popularity. Well-mannered rage is their selling point. This is not Athens.
""It is not really a movement,"" says Josep Lobera, a pollster. ""It is a symptom. It expresses a general feeling of concern and anger."" Conservatives rubbish the indignants as extremists. Some see a leftist group girding itself to battle a right-wing reformist People's Party (PP) government, led by Mariano Rajoy, that is likely to win power in the next election. 
That analysis may be right, to judge by a recent open-air assembly on the economy, with a few dozen participants squatting on the paving stones of Madrid's Plaza del Carmen. The ideas they discussed included striking out an obscure clause in the Lisbon treaty that prevents central banks giving cheap credit to governments, and holding a referendum on labour and pension reforms. The recent ""pact for the euro"" was another target. Some contemplated a general strike. So far, so left. 
But if this is extremism, why does support for the indignants hold up when the communist-led United Left party wins just 4% of the vote? One answer is that it is not only left-wingers who are indignant. ""It is true there are many people from the far left, but there are also some economic liberals and centrists,"" says Francisco Canero, a former small businessman and now an activist. The movement is bound by complaints, not solutions.
Political parties are one concern. Spaniards rate politicians their third-biggest problem, behind the economy and unemployment. Polls show broad support for removing the statute of limitations on the corruption cases that poison regional and municipal politics. But analysts also point to a wider change of mood. Court investigations into the tax affairs of Emilio Botin, head of Banco Santander, and suspected fraud at the Spanish Society of Authors, which campaigns against internet piracy, help to fire up the indignants. Bankinter, a retail bank, has responded to fury over home repossessions by introducing the first Spanish mortgage that can be walked away from, American-style, simply by handing over the keys.
Mr Rubalcaba has begun to bash bankers. He accuses them of lending to people who they knew could not repay, and threatens extra taxes. A polite nod, perhaps, to mannerly indignation--but one that carries hints of populism.

But politicians ignore the indignants at their peril. Up to 80% of Spaniards say they support the earnest young protesters. Even the occasional lapse into violence, such as a blockade of the Catalan parliament on June 15th, has done little to dent their popularity. Well-mannered rage is their selling point. This is not Athens.
""It is not really a movement,"" says Josep Lobera, a pollster. ""It is a symptom. It expresses a general feeling of concern and anger."" Conservatives rubbish the indignants as extremists. Some see a leftist group girding itself to battle a right-wing reformist People's Party (PP) government, led by Mariano Rajoy, that is likely to win power in the next election. 
That analysis may be right, to judge by a recent open-air assembly on the economy, with a few dozen participants squatting on the paving stones of Madrid's Plaza del Carmen. The ideas they discussed included striking out an obscure clause in the Lisbon treaty that prevents central banks giving cheap credit to governments, and holding a referendum on labour and pension reforms. The recent ""pact for the euro"" was another target. Some contemplated a general strike. So far, so left. 
But if this is extremism, why does support for the indignants hold up when the communist-led United Left party wins just 4% of the vote? One answer is that it is not only left-wingers who are indignant. ""It is true there are many people from the far left, but there are also some economic liberals and centrists,"" says Francisco Canero, a former small businessman and now an activist. The movement is bound by complaints, not solutions.
Political parties are one concern. Spaniards rate politicians their third-biggest problem, behind the economy and unemployment. Polls show broad support for removing the statute of limitations on the corruption cases that poison regional and municipal politics. But analysts also point to a wider change of mood. Court investigations into the tax affairs of Emilio Botin, head of Banco Santander, and suspected fraud at the Spanish Society of Authors, which campaigns against internet piracy, help to fire up the indignants. Bankinter, a retail bank, has responded to fury over home repossessions by introducing the first Spanish mortgage that can be walked away from, American-style, simply by handing over the keys.
Mr Rubalcaba has begun to bash bankers. He accuses them of lending to people who they knew could not repay, and threatens extra taxes. A polite nod, perhaps, to mannerly indignation--but one that carries hints of populism.

THE game was up. Last week Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero, Spain's prime minister, announced that the country would hold a general election on November 20th, four months earlier than planned. In doing so, he was bringing forward a new era in Spanish politics. The unpopular Mr Zapatero, who has responded only belatedly to Spain's economic difficulties, announced several months ago that he would not seek another term in office. But he knows that his successor as Socialist candidate for prime minister, Alfredo Perez Rubalcaba, stands virtually no chance of winning the vote. Polls suggest that Mariano Rajoy, leader of the opposition conservative People's Party (PP), looks certain to triumph.
Mr Rajoy pledges reform, and Spain certainly needs it. The economy is stagnant. At 21%, the unemployment rate is by some way the worst in the European Union. With borrowing costs once again spiralling this week, Mr Zapatero was forced to postpone his summer holiday to cope with the crisis. Mr Rajoy called for the vote to be held sooner, in October .
Mr Rajoy realises that what Spaniards most want are jobs and a sound economy. But he also offers something that stretches credibility: austerity without pain. ""I do not intend to make social cuts,"" he says. 
Since May, when the PP soared to victory over the Socialists in local and regional elections, voters have had a sneak preview of the party in office. The PP now runs 11 of Spain's 17 autonomous governments; this matters in a decentralised country where regional administrations accounted for almost a third of the overall budget deficit last year.
The signs are not encouraging. Elena Salgado, the finance minister, wants regional governments to do their bit by limiting their budget deficits to 1.3% of GDP this year. At a meeting last week she urged them to return money advanced by central government in previous years on the basis of growth estimates that turned out to be overly optimistic. 
Not possible, squealed the PP regions (backed by Socialist Andalusia). Some claimed that sending the money back would squeeze their ability to finance health and education properly. Tiny Murcia--historically a big over-spender--even threatened to hand back administration of those services to Madrid. ""The government asphyxiates us,"" moaned Salvador Marin, the region's finance boss. In the end Ms Salgado blinked, offering soft loans to cover half the money the regions must return, and so in effect bumping up the national debt.
Some PP-run regional governments have eked out efficiencies, cut investment and merged departments. Madrid, for example, has been even more austere than the central government wished. But elsewhere, problems are mounting. In Catalonia, whose economy is as big as Portugal's, the minority nationalist government plans to run a deficit of 2.7% of GDP this year, more than twice Ms Salgado's limit. The PP, which props up Artur Mas's administration in Barcelona, has identified EUR 1.2 billion ($1.7 billion) of further savings. But rather than reduce the deficit further it wants this money ploughed back into health services. 
Mr Rajoy faces a dilemma over the coming months. To win votes he must seem moderate, but to gain respect from the markets and Brussels he must seem severe. For the moment, votes are what counts. One recent poll showed that the Socialists had cut the PP's lead to seven percentage points. If that transpires on election day, Mr Rajoy would find himself at the head of a minority government, with less clout over the economy.
Either way, cutting the deficit is likely to be one of his hardest tasks. He is against raising taxes so, if growth does not pick up, he must cut spending instead. This year Spain is aiming to bring the deficit down from 9.2% of GDP to 6%. Next year's target is 4.4%. In private, some in the PP acknowledge that Ms Salgado has made a good start. It is now time for their leader to show how he means to follow her.

WHO'S in charge here? As the jittery Socialist government of Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero, Spain's outgoing prime minister, pushes through a constitutional change to cap budget deficits, it looks increasingly as if Mariano Rajoy, the leader of the conservative opposition, is already in the driving seat.
Demands for a German-style ""golden rule"" deficit cap have long been a mantra for Mr Rajoy's People's Party (PP). Hitherto, they have met with Socialist scorn. Now the two parties plan to write a cap into the constitution before parliament is dissolved on September 27th. It is the first big change since the document was drafted in 1978, three years after Franco died.
Soraya Saenz de Santamaria of the PP solemnly announced the new cross-party agreement on what she called ""one of the main structural reforms needed by the Spanish economy"". From tone and content, a first-time visitor might have divined that the PP was already in power--which, according to opinion polls, it will be after a general election due in November.
Mr Zapatero's latest U-turn, like previous pirouettes on pensions, labour reform and spending cuts, was a response to the markets and to Angela Merkel and Nicolas Sarkozy. The German chancellor and French president jointly demanded golden rules across the euro zone in August. Spain will now get there before France. Only Germany currently has a constitutional ""debt brake"" in its Basic Law. If Spain needs EU help to keep sovereign-debt yields down, it can at least tell suspicious Germans that it is an eager, obedient pupil. 
In private, Mr Zapatero reportedly told Socialist critics this was the ""least harsh"" option left as sovereign-debt yields soared and the European Central Bank bought Spanish bonds in large quantities. But what will voters make of it? Some want a referendum. Opponents say the cap, which would limit the structural budget deficit to 0.4% of GDP from 2020, would tie the hands of future governments too tightly. Unions have called demonstrations.
But there are get-out clauses for recessions or national crises. And with the actual figure to be established by a separate--and more easily alterable--law, wriggle-room is guaranteed. 
Socialists fear that Mr Zapatero has handed the PP an early electoral gift. But Spaniards remain Eurofanatics, and the socialists hope they will get credit for this step towards euro-zone economic integration. ""If Europe is to adopt measures, we should be in the lead group,"" says Alfredo Perez Rubalcaba, the Socialist candidate for prime minister.
What the measure will not do is plug Spain's current deficit hole, likely to be 6% this year. Moreover, 2020 is light-years away in political terms, and with 21% unemployment Spain's more urgent need is for growth. Though Mr Rajoy has scored a victory, the economy needs much more than his golden rule.","The parties agree on a German - style constitutional deficit cap

ON SEPTEMBER 26th Spain's parliament was dissolved, ahead of a general election on November 20th. The next day King Juan Carlos signed only the second change to the constitution in its 33 years--to fix a budget-deficit cap by 2020. 
Two momentous days for Spain. But there was little excitement, perhaps because the election result already seems clear. Mariano Rajoy of the opposition conservative People's Party (PP) is set to become presidente del gobierno, as Spaniards call their prime minister, ending nearly eight years of Socialist rule under Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero. Polls give Mr Rajoy a lead of up to 15%, enough to give him an absolute majority in parliament, something Mr Zapatero never secured.
The scale of the task that Mr Rajoy will face is growing by the day. Spain's unemployment rate of 21% is by some way the highest in the European Union. The problem is getting worse: in September the number of registered unemployed took its biggest monthly leap for 15 years. Many of the new jobless are civil servants, including health workers and teachers, laid off by regional governments. Goldman Sachs predicts that the next prime minister will spend his first year in office presiding over a shrinking economy. 
Mr Zapatero's government, meanwhile, cancelled an attempt to ease the debt burden by selling part of the state lottery company, which runs the famous El Gordo (Fat One) payout at Christmas, saying that in the current climate it would not get a reasonable price. And the central bank has nationalised three more of Spain's troubled cajas (savings banks), at near-zero valuations. 
Mr Rajoy's instincts are reformist, and an absolute majority would no doubt make his life easier. But Spain's economic predicament creates its own restrictions. Mr Rajoy has pledged to meet Spain's EU-agreed targets, which will force him to cut the budget deficit from 6% of GDP this year to 4.4% next year and 3% in 2013. He has reportedly held back from unveiling details of his policy programme until he knows whether Spain can afford them. 
The plans that the PP has already proposed, including tax cuts for small and medium-sized businesses and a EUR 3,000 ($4,000) subsidy to those hiring their first employee, are intended to create jobs. But whether a PP government will make the radical labour-market reforms needed depends in part on who becomes finance minister. Mr Rajoy is keeping this a secret, saying only that he will reach outside the party if need be. 
The Socialists, who will be led into the election by Alfredo Perez Rubalcaba, a former deputy prime minister, say that Mr Rajoy is running a ""Valium campaign"", full of benign statements of intent but short on detail. He will avoid taking on Mr Rubalcaba in television debates, they believe, to stop the campaign turning into a contest over the future of the welfare state.
But voters have had a chance to see PP politicians in action since the party's victory in local and regional elections in May. PP-run regional governments are pushing through tough austerity programmes, with Castilla-La Mancha pledging to cut spending by 20% next year. The government in the Madrid region is fighting a fierce battle against secondary-school teachers, whose numbers are being reduced. Parents have received angry letters penned in staffrooms and handed to children. Teachers have gone on strike on five days of a school year that has barely begun. Health workers in Catalonia, where the PP props up a nationalist government, are also in revolt. 
This tendency to provoke conflict, think some Socialists, may be a chink in the PP's armour. It will not be enough to win them re-election in November. But some in the party are thinking of the next election, in 2015 or 2016. If Mr Rajoy cannot turn things around by then, they may be back.","Mariano Rajoy's will have a tough job on Mariano Rajoy's hands

WHEN ETA broke off a ceasefire in 2007, Jesus Eguiguren, a Basque negotiating on behalf of the Spanish government, warned his separatist counterpart, Francisco Javier Lopez Pena, that his destiny was to spend years in jail. ""And you should buy black ties,"" Mr Lopez Pena retorted, for the funerals of future victims of the Basque terror organisation. 
Both men were right. ETA killed ten times over the next three years. Mr Eguiguren was pall-bearer at the funeral of Isaias Carrasco, his friend and fellow Basque Socialist. But in 2008 Mr Lopez Pena, then ETA's leader, was captured in France.
On October 20th, one of Mr Lopez Pena's successors--believed to be a former lawyer called David Pla--donned a beret and a white face-mask and filmed a statement in which he announced a definitive end to ETA's 40 years of terrorism. For Spain, it was an historic moment. A bloody campaign that began under Franco's military dictatorship and claimed 829 lives was finished. ""The nightmare is over,"" declared Inigo Urkullu, head of the Basque country's biggest party, the moderate Basque Nationalist Party (PNV).
One reason ETA has downed arms is that hardliners like Mr Lopez Pena are behind bars. Another is that the campaign of terror he had planned failed to happen. Several of his successors were detained in a series of joint Spanish-French police operations. ETA became virtually inoperative. Ten killings in three years was paltry by its standards. ""Spanish democracy has defeated ETA,"" declared Antonio Camacho, the interior minister.
Yet it is too early to write ETA's obituary. It has neither disarmed nor disbanded. A violent breakaway group, similar to the Real IRA in Northern Ireland, could emerge. ETA has asked for talks with Spain and France. This, it says, is how ""armed confrontation"" can be finally overcome.
Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero, Spain's Socialist prime minister, deserves credit for dragging ETA this far. But the job of negotiating with the group will fall to his successor, after a general election on November 20th. That will almost certainly be Mariano Rajoy, whose conservative People's Party (PP) looks set to win a landslide.
Talking to ETA is ""a betrayal of the dead,"" Mr Rajoy once said. But so far he has displayed moderation. ""This is a great piece of news,"" he said, before calling for ETA's dissolution. When Spaniards start to enjoy a peace dividend in the form of lower security costs and higher tourism receipts in the Basque country, pressure will build to sort out the remaining issues.
Concessions to ETA's demand for a separate Basque state are out. But the government could take other steps, such as moving some of the 700 ETA prisoners in Spanish and French prisons closer to the Basque country, or exercising leniency on day- and early-release programmes. Still, ETA is not in a strong bargaining position. Mass prisoner-release programmes, if they ever come, must wait. The problem of ETA members in hiding, like Mr Pla, is trickier. Most Spaniards want to see them in court. They may prefer to be exiled to a beach somewhere in the Caribbean.
ETA's arms, hidden in France and the Basque country, must inevitably be given up, says Brian Currin, a South African lawyer. The PP has denounced his fellow ""mediators"", including Kofi Annan, a former UN secretary-general, as unwelcome meddlers. Mr Rajoy may, however, need them to oversee a discreet disarmament process.
A separate demand comes from the politicians who led ETA away from violence. Banned front parties, like Batasuna, want to be allowed back into mainstream politics. A coalition they linked up with, Bildu, won 26% of Basque votes in municipal elections in May, suggesting that it has much to gain from Spanish democracy. Mr Rajoy will come under pressure to respond. All this will take years but, happily for the long-suffering Basques, there is no taste for turning back.

Unemployment has hit 22.6%, and over 5m Spaniards are jobless (see chart on next page). One in nine households has nobody in formal paid employment. Growth is at a halt; a second recession looms.
In Castile-La Mancha, officials admit they will overshoot their deficit target by a factor of seven. The outgoing Socialist finance minister, Elena Salgado, insists Spain will meet its target of 6% of GDP this year, but overspending regions (Castile-La Mancha is the worst offender) threaten this, as do flattening tax revenues. Spain's banks must raise some EUR 26 billion ($36 billion) in new capital by June, a quarter of the total demanded for the euro zone by the European Banking Authority. And they have yet to digest their toxic assets, mostly loans to developers to build on land that is almost worthless or occupied by some of the country's 700,000 empty homes. The central bank says these problem loans could total EUR 176 billion ($243 billion).
With polls giving the PP a 15-point lead over Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero's outgoing Socialists, Mr Rajoy is heading for an absolute parliamentary majority. From this position of strength he could drive through serious reform. So why did the PP's full manifesto this week fail to make many newspaper front pages?
Greece's referendum on the euro bail-out, which sent Spain's debt yields soaring too, was partly to blame. But another reason was what Alfredo Perez Rubalcaba, who has replaced Mr Zapatero as the Socialists' candidate, calls the ""calculated ambiguity"" of a manifesto that is long on intentions but short on specifics. PP officials argue that, given the euro crisis, promises now may look foolish or impossible tomorrow. But the manifesto is ambitious in tone: a slimmer state, with lower business taxes, looser employment laws and less red tape would, it claims, spur growth and get employers hiring again. 
Privatisation of television stations and other public companies comes with a taste for public-private partnerships and outsourcing public services to private contractors. Reforms could make it cheaper for employers to hire and fire. Collective-bargaining changes should allow companies to make more competitive wage deals. An Austrian-style fund built up by individual workers to cover spells of unemployment is promised. Banks will be encouraged to shed or write down their toxic assets.
Public austerity and transparency are the watchwords in the manifesto. Few doubt the PP's commitment to a 3% deficit by 2013. But that will mean increasing the tax take, says Pablo Vazquez of FEDEA, an economic think-tank. So how can Mr Rajoy lower business taxes? And if he cannot, how can he spur the economy? Curing Spain will not be easy--or quick.","The centre - right heads towards a big win but a poisonous inheritance

TIPOS INFAMES IS a fine bookshop in central Madrid, run by three young friends and stocked with the sort of books you were always meaning to read, until work and children got in the way. Well aware that the intellect needs gentle encouragement, the owners lure you in with strong coffee and generous glasses of Spanish wine. Running a bookshop is difficult, says ""Curro"" Llorca; these days he doesn't get so much reading done either. But business is passable.
Curro and his friends needed three years to set up shop. They had to obtain a full house of separate permits, one to sell books, a second to sell coffee and a third to sell wine. The town hall said not to worry and advised Curro to open his doors while he was still waiting for the paperwork. But the budding entrepreneurs wondered what they would do if the police turned up.
Tormented by unemployment, Spain needs new firms like Tipos Infames. Yet in the World Bank's ranking of how easy it is to start a business the country comes only 133rd, after Kenya. 
Next to quelling the crisis, the single most important task facing Europe's economies is to grow, because only then will they eventually be able to pay off their debts. In order to do that, they need to improve their competitiveness. And the best route to improved competitiveness is to streamline the public sector and overhaul the markets for labour and services. 
Yet Europe has failed for many years to accomplish just such structural reforms. Looking at Curro, the economic logic for change is unanswerable. But the politics is grim. Across Europe, business is held back by bureaucracy. Powerful interest groups are protected at the expense of everyone else.
The crisis only strengthens the case for reform (see box). But it also means that reform must take place against the background of austerity, as societies struggle to determine who will shoulder the burden of debt. The darkening clouds of civil disobedience and anarchy confronting Greece's new government show where this struggle can lead. Europe's future depends not just on governments putting forward the right policies but on the capacity of democracies to bring about peaceful change. How to gain in Spain
How might reform work? Again, consider Spain. Reform there should stand a good chance. The country has done well out of EU membership. After it joined in 1986, incomes caught up with the rest of the union. Its large exporters have remained an island of efficiency, as competitive as any in Europe. Spain recently signalled its commitment to the euro zone by writing a cap on future deficits into the constitution. 
Moreover, the Spanish may be about to vote for change. An election later this month is likely to bring in a new conservative government under Mariano Rajoy of the People's Party (PP). If the opinion polls are to be believed, he stands to win a sweeping victory and to be able to govern with an absolute majority. Given that the PP also controls many of Spain's regions, Mr Rajoy will have an unprecedented mandate to remake Spain. ""People know the PP is going to be severe,"" says Jose Ignacio Torreblanca of the European Council on Foreign Relations.
But what a task he faces. A prime target will be Spain's notoriously dysfunctional labour market. This provides a group of ageing, virtually unsackable ""insiders"" with gold-plated contracts, whereas the rest have to make do with highly insecure temporary contracts. Among other things, insiders benefit from wage-escalation clauses, so that in 2009 real pay rose by 3.2% even though the economy shrank by 3.7%. And Spain gives young people a terrible deal: in a downturn they are the first to be sacked. Not only are roughly half of under-30s out of work, but those who do have jobs are mainly on temporary contracts that leave them without a career structure and give firms no incentive to train them. 
Mr Rajoy is elusive about his plans. The outgoing government has undertaken some labour-market reform, but most people expect the PP to go much further and doubt that the weakened Spanish unions will be able to put up much of a fight. But that is the easy bit. To transform the Spanish economy, Mr Rajoy also needs to take on two far more elusive foes.
First is the country's dense jungle of regulation and bureaucracy. This dates back to Franco, who from the 1950s sought to give Spaniards more freedom by trying to establish the rule of law even as he denied them democracy. The profusion of administrative law created a dense and unaccountable bureaucracy. Ignacio Sanchez-Cuenca, director of the Juan March Institute in Madrid, encountered so many obstacles to hiring academics from outside the EU for the institute that it took up a quarter of his time. So he hired a firm of lawyers to do the job and now spends 5-10% of his budget that way.
What makes Spain's bureaucracy especially poisonous is Mr Rajoy's second foe: the country's fiercely independent regions. Each tends to interpret regulations in its own way, so over time the Spanish market has fragmented. Juan Jose Guemes, a PP politician and a professor at the IE Business School in Madrid, explains how the star-rating system for hotels differs slightly across Spain, which limits competition among national and international chains and reduces economies of scale. Last year the Catalan government decreed that hotels must serve pa amb tomaquet, bread with tomato, a local speciality, if they are to count as ""luxury"". Miguel Cardoso, an economist at BBVA, a Spanish bank, estimates that, thanks to a lack of competition, half of the inflation in Spain over and above the average for the euro zone in the past 15-20 years came from firms increasing their margins.
Mr Guemes's colleague at IE, Fernando Fernandez, adds that each of the regions sponsors its own development policy and its own businesses, often financed by local savings banks. This is inefficient, but the regions are popular because they spend taxes collected by the central government. Moreover, regional autonomy is an antidote to the centralising, anti-union bias of Franco's Spain. Even if the centre can control the regions' spending--a big if--""we have a free market at the national level and are protectionist at the regional level,"" says Mr Fernandez.
Each reforming government in Europe faces different obstacles, but Spain is typical of them all in the sense that radical structural reform entails rewriting the social contract. Just now the generous wages of many of those in Spain's protected jobs are supporting entire households of unemployed spouses and grown-up children. Scrapping thousands of bureaucratic rules will not just make the economy more efficient but also recast the relations between government and citizen. However unambiguous the economics of reform, the politics is almost always hard.
Too hard for some. Rome alone is said to have half as many lawyers as the whole of France. The legal system there moves so slowly, Italians joke, that they put you in jail when you are accused and release you when they find you guilty. Yet faced with the liberalisation of their profession in a recent budget, Italy's lawyers somehow managed to hang on to their perks--was it because so many politicians are lawyers?
Instead of imposing reforms, the fag-end of a government under Silvio Berlusconi has relied excessively on tax rises. After he was shamed by euro-zone leaders during recent summits Mr Berlusconi at last came up with a more ambitious programme--but even then he was obliged to accept the supervision of the IMF. The mix of hopelessness and humiliation has left his government close to collapse.
Others have shown more courage. Ireland's government has cut wages and slashed benefits and services. Unit labour costs have fallen by 8% and the economy grew by 1.6% in the second quarter. The cuts have been even harsher in Estonia, where the economy shrank by 15% in 2009. Growth has soared since then and unemployment tumbled. Still, both economies face a hard slog. Because they are counting on foreign demand as a source of growth, they are vulnerable to a global recession.
The nightmare is Greece. Government there has never been about the rational design and administration of policy, but about dishing out patronage. When George Papaconstantinou, the country's finance minister at the time, was asked why tax receipts collapsed in 2009, the year his government came to office, he explained that ""the first thing the government does in an election year is pull the tax collectors off the streets."" 
Even so, the government of George Papandreou (in which Mr Papaconstantinou served) undertook reform with a savagery that would once have been unthinkable. He had a gun to his head, because the troika of the EU, the IMF and the ECB release aid each quarter only if the Greek government meets its targets. 
Yet, beset by protests, a shrinking economy, the dishonour of being bossed around by foreigners and the prospect of a decade of further austerity, Mr Papandreou could not carry the country with him. His reluctantly resigned, following a botched proposal to hold a referendum on the euro zone's plans for Greece. The installation of a new government of national unity smacks of Argentina, where a succession of short-lived administrations fought to avoid default--before eventually succumbing.
Mr Papandreou's ejection contains a warning. At root, the solvency of a country is determined by the government's capacity to raise revenues and cut spending. Politicians run up against the popular will long before they run out of things to tax.
The crisis has also brought down governments in Ireland, Portugal and Slovakia. Spain, and others, are likely to follow. Where will voters turn when they have had their fill of austerity and reform? The lesson of the 1930s and of emerging-market crises down the years is that people can take only so much austerity. If the burden gets too heavy, the political system collapses.
This fear lies behind the warnings of Milton Friedman and Martin Feldstein, two American economists, who said that the euro is inherently unstable. Until recently euro zone leaders scoffed at such talk. But in the past couple of weeks they have suddenly begun to contemplate Greece's departure from the single currency. And contemplation is one step short of action. Their change of heart is not just because of mayhem in Athens, but also because of the difficult politics of the euro at home.""

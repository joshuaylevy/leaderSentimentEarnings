""WHOEVER wins Madrid, will win the general election in March."" So said Jose Luis Zapatero, leader of Spain's opposition Socialists some months ago. Now that the centre-right People's Party has regained control of Madrid, Mr Zapatero has modified his position: he had expected a far worse result, and his party is in better shape than ever for the spring elections. Yet it is his original forecast that may prove the more accurate.
The lessons to be learned from Madrid are far from clear. The poll was a rerun, because the Socialists and the United Left had failed to form a government after winning the elections in May. Two Socialists refused to support the coalition and fled, amid allegations that they were paid off by Madrid's booming construction industry. In the months before the rerun Mr Zapatero did not do enough to convince Socialist voters that he had taken his party firmly in hand. In particular, he fumbled the chance to punish Jose Maria Aznar, the prime minister, for his hugely unpopular support of the war in Iraq and for his mishandling of the Prestige oil spill. 
Even so the Madrid result does not necessarily guarantee a victory for Mr Aznar's recently anointed successor, Mariano Rajoy, in five months' time. The win was not as good for the People's Party as had been forecast by recent opinion polls. The party won 51 seats, thereby clinching Spain's most populous region by just a three-seat majority. 
The new regional president, Esperanza Aguirre, 51, described as ""unremarkable"" by a former Aznar aide, does little to lift the spirits. She is Spain's second female regional leader, who has been handed a reprieve after rather ordinary stints as education minister and president of the senate. She has been harried in the press for being frivolous, marrying a count and being furtive about her wealth. ""I do not intend to exhibit assets nor do a striptease,"" was the tart response she gave to her critics. She is nevertheless one of the People's Party's few liberal ideologues, once spoken of as a Spanish Margaret Thatcher.
The most positive result for the centre-right in Madrid is that a wedge has been driven between the supposed sins of Mr Aznar and those of his successor. ""Given that the elections lie halfway between the May ballot and the general elections next year, the Madrid defeat is a worrying one for the Socialists,"" the conservative daily newspaper ABC opined in an editorial. ""If the war in Iraq and the Prestige disaster didn't produce a change in May, the elections in Madrid proved they were no longer valid arguments."" For the left, Mr Zapatero's leadership has withstood an uncomfortable test that he had to pass to run in March--but there was precious little other consolation.
Recent opinion polls show the People's Party with a good chance of either winning a slim outright majority in March or of being forced, once again, into an alliance with a regional party such as the Catalan nationalists. It is in Spain's regions, rather than the capital, where the tone for the elections is being set. The regional Basque leader, Juan Jose Ibarretxe, formally announced his plan for ""a Basque state associated with Spain"" last week. The People's Party fears that the normally quieter nationalists of Catalonia may be emboldened by the Basque initiative. With Catalan elections due on November 16th the tone is becoming shrill.",230,Spain,"Foreshadowing the next election

JUAN MARI ARZAK, doyen among Basque chefs, disappears across his dining-room at the first mention of politics. ""I do not want anything to do with it,"" he says. Yet Spain's political season, now in full swing, cannot but intrude. A general election on March 14th will see the retirement of Jose Mara Aznar, after eight years as prime minister--although his People's Party, under Mariano Rajoy, is on course to win again. Argument continues over more powers for Spain's regions, especially Catalonia and the Basque country. Mr Aznar declares that the constitution is under threat. Is there a risk of Spain unravelling?
The answer is probably no, but there are at least reasons to pose the question. The moderate nationalist (PNV) premier of the Basque region, Juan Jose Ibarretxe, still touts his plan for a referendum on self-determination. In Catalonia, a coalition government of socialists and radical nationalists formed after last November's election is demanding more autonomy--despite the forced resignation of the radical nationalists' leader, Josep Llus Carod-Rovira, after he admitted talking to the Basque terrorist group, ETA. Others among Spain's 17 ""autonomous regions"" are watching: Manuel Chaves, the socialist leader of Andalusia, says he would like to renegotiate relations with Madrid.
Yet other developments point to a lowering of tensions. The nastiest form of nationalism has, thankfully, quietened. Last year ETA killed only three people: excluding a 14-month ceasefire that ended in 1999, this is the smallest number since 1973. More effective co-operation with France's police and security services has helped. In December, several top ETA men were arrested in two French raids.
Also, besides the replacement of a hardline Mr Aznar by a (maybe softer) Mr Rajoy, several veterans are going. Xabier Arzalluz, a nationalist firebrand, has retired as president of the PNV after 30 years. His hatred of Castilian Spain and his populist rants will not be missed even in his own party. His successor (not chosen by him) is Josu Jon Imaz, a moderate with a power base in Vizcaya. In his first big speech, he spoke of creating a civic society for all Basques, not an ethnic one; strongly condemned ETA; and ruled out a repetition of the Lizarra pact that the PNV signed with Batasuna, ETA's political wing, in 1998.
Catalonia's Jordi Pujol also stood down in November, after 23 years as the region's premier. The radical nationalists who chanted ""Long Live Free Catalonia"" after the election may have sent a chill down Madrileno spines; but the (now departed) Mr Carod-Rovira reassuringly said that independence was not a priority. Pasquall Maragall, the new Socialist premier, is, however, pressing ahead with plans for a new statute to include Catalonia's right to be recognised as a nation. 
Madrid's response to all this is to assert that the regions already enjoy an extremely high level of autonomy under the 1978 constitution. They handle 60% of Spain's public spending; Madrid's share is just 40%. The Basque region collects all taxes, before passing on a chunk to the centre. The central government brushes off rich Catalonia's complaint that it gives more in taxes than it receives, noting that the Madrid region is also a net contributor. 
In the Basque capital, Vitoria, Mr Ibarretxe plays down the controversial elements of his referendum plan. ""There has been a phoney debate created by Aznar, who has used it to create a climate of anti-Basque aggression,"" he says. ""It is not an independentista plan. We are not going to make any unilateral moves."" The plan, backed by Mr Imaz, is to hold a referendum on the Basques' right to decide their own future, perhaps to make the region a ""free state"" associated with Spain. But Mr Ibarretxe says all this is negotiable. He wants the plan to be debated in the regional assembly in September. In response to non-nationalists' fears, he insists that ""this is a way to open dialogue between all parties and to find a way for non-nationalists and nationalists to live together peacefully."" 
Many Basques (57%, says one poll) still do not grasp the ultimate aim of the Ibarretxe plan. Basque business is largely sceptical. The government of lava is hostile, and some politicians there have talked of seceding from the Basque region if Mr Ibarretxe proceeds. Genoveva Gastaminza, editor of the Basque edition of El Pas, believes the plan is going nowhere: ""It is a talking-shop. It is a result of the PNV's mistake of the Lizarra pact. They have to be seen to be advancing the nationalist cause but Mr Ibarretxe faces divisions among the party's own conservative, Catholic ranks."" 
The plan might not win majority support. In a Euskobarmetro poll last November, 32% of Basques backed the status quo, 31% supported a federal model of greater autonomy and only 31% favoured independence. Even the now banned Batasuna is lukewarm, irked by the PNV's refusal to form a united front for the March elections and charging that the PNV is using the plan to steal its votes. ""We are accused of being espanolistas from one side and etarras on the other,"" says Mr Ibarretxe, wearily. 
Mr Aznar is not taken in by any mollifying words from Vitoria. ""To speak of dialogue with constitutional parties and then to defend secession is incompatible,"" he has said. But Mr Aznar is equally alive to the political benefits of keeping the nationalist bogeyman alive. His party makes great play of jeering the opposition socialists, led by Jose Luis Rodrguez Zapatero, for their pact with the radical nationalists in Catalonia. Mr Aznar, who survived an ETA assassination attempt in 1995, trumpets the results of his firmness with the regions. His decision to ban Batasuna and his refusal to talk not only to ETA but even to the PNV have, he says, succeeded. He points to the drop in political street violence as well as to the recent apparent defanging of ETA. 
There is, even so, force in the Socialist claim that Mr Aznar's tenure has alienated many Catalans and Basques, and also radicalised some strains of nationalism. Moderates in the People's Party hope that while Mr Rajoy continues to slash at the many-headed hydra of ETA he will also bring a change of tone. He might prove more open to debate on how to accommodate the legitimate aspirations of the regions. The screen of European integration could be his best cover for giving them greater autonomy--if he is brave enough to use it.",230,Spain,"Spain's election once again throws the spotlight on its rebellious regions

Jose Luis Rodrguez Zapatero, the new prime minister, swiftly promised to pull Spanish troops out of Iraq, calling the occupation a ""fiasco"". The Socialists benefited from an unexpectedly high turnout, and from the anger of many voters over the Aznar government's attempt to attribute the bombings to the Basque terrorist group, ETA.
The blame for the bombings was instead ascribed to Islamic terrorists, possibly linked to al-Qaeda, with suspicion falling particularly on several Moroccans. Other European countries, especially Britain and France, were braced to be likely next targets.

IF YOU carry out a well planned atrocity, killing more than 200 people and injuring more than a thousand, and three days later the government that supported an invasion to which you object is unexpectedly defeated in a general election, you are entitled to consider the venture to have been a success. So although Spain's high voting turnout on March 14th, and many Spaniards' apparent ire at the way Jose Mara Aznar's government had prematurely blamed Basque terrorists for the outrage, can be taken as healthily democratic signs ()see page 41, there is no escaping the fact that the biggest triumph has been that of the terrorists. Assuming, as is likely, that they are indeed linked to or are members of Osama bin Laden's al-Qaeda network, they scored another success when the new Socialist prime minister, Jose Luis Rodrguez Zapatero, said he would withdraw Spain's 1,300 troops from Iraq. This may only be a symbolic move, for that is a mere 1% of the American-led coalition's forces there, but symbols and emotions are what terrorism is all about.
To say all that is not to say that it is wrong to vote out governments that supported the invasion of Iraq a year ago. In some cases, such as Spain, they did so against a huge majority of public opinion. In all cases, their claims that Saddam Hussein had stockpiles of dangerous weapons now look to be a blunder, a gamble or a deception. This year both George Bush himself and John Howard, Australia's prime minister, face re-election contests and next year Britain's Tony Blair is also expected to do so. There is now a real possibility that all three could follow Mr Aznar's party into defeat--though Mr Blair may be saved by the fact that his Tory opposition supported the war strongly, too. Such defeats would be natural, in democratic terms. But the tragedy of Madrid is that the terrorists in effect cast the swing vote, given that Mr Aznar's party had looked set to win a comfortable victory, despite opposition to the war, and that such success may now stimulate more terrorism during the other three electoral campaigns. The big question, if such defeats occur, is whether successor governments would be more effective in pursuing al-Qaeda and stabilising the regions within which its terrorists thrive--or less.
One year on
Some critics of the war in Iraq say that there is no such danger. There was no genuine link between toppling Saddam and fighting al-Qaeda, so to punish governments for what opponents claim was an illegal invasion is a quite separate matter. Mr Zapatero even appears to think that pulling troops out of Iraq will make things better, on the view that the occupation is itself the cause of terrorism. Yet that policy is irresponsible, because it increases the risk of civil war in Iraq. Even those who opposed the war should now want to help make Iraq secure enough for Iraqis themselves to take back their sovereignty. If other new governments copy Mr Zapatero and prove their anti-war point by withdrawing from Iraq, they will make everyone less safe as a result. And it is a delusion to claim, as Mr Zapatero does, that all would be well if the UN were to take over from the Americans. Few Iraqis think so. It is as well to recall the Dutch UN peacekeepers who looked on helplessly during the Srebrenica massacre in Bosnia in 1995.
Moreover, withdrawal would put the rest of the Middle East at greater risk, too. For even if there was no direct link between Saddam and al-Qaeda, the connection was always indirect and much more long-term: that while he remained in power to threaten his neighbours and required bombing and sanctions to contain him, it would be impossible to move towards a wider peace and modernisation of that whole troubled region. To advocates of the war, including The Economist, sticking with the status quo looked a more dangerous option than toppling Saddam.
On that view, the stance taken against Saddam by Messrs Bush, Blair, Howard and Aznar could prove to have been politically suicidal but historically noble. But will it, really? One year after the invasion it remains too soon to say. Many things have improved in Iraq since Saddam's regime was removed, but the situation remains fragile and the danger of civil war real ()see pages 27-29. A new opinion poll this week suggested that Iraqis are rather more positive about the change in their lives than outsiders are, but attitudes vary around the country. The invasion itself, and the show of American strength that it entailed, has produced some promising changes in the surrounding region, too, in relations with Libya, Syria, Iran and Pakistan, and glimmerings of democratic reform in Saudi Arabia. Those moves have so far been modest, however, and this week the Saudi authorities underlined that fact by arresting some prominent reformists. Moreover, such modest gains have been overshadowed by the complete lack of progress in pacifying the region's most bitter conflict: that between Israel and the Palestinians.
The right grounds on which to criticise and even condemn the perpetrators of regime change in Iraq now lie in that slow or non-existent regional progress. They, especially the Bush administration, do deserve criticism for their mishandling of the post-war situation in Iraq, but the correct response is to strengthen the effort to rebuild and secure Iraq, not weaken it. They deserve much more criticism, though, for having so far failed to turn the strategic change represented by the fall of Saddam into a wider and more profound set of changes: notably, a restoration of full relations with Iran and the establishment of some sort of Arab-American alliance to persuade the Israelis and Palestinians back to the negotiating table. Such things could never have happened overnight and many a previous attempt, whether American or European, has foundered amid the blood of the Middle East. Yet as the terror in Madrid showed, time is on no one's side. In contrast to its urgency over invading Iraq, the Bush administration has shown little urgency in trying to achieve these wider goals.
Would new governments, led by John Kerry, Mark Latham (in Australia) and Michael Howard (in Britain), do better? It is premature, in all three countries, to judge. No doubt, all would find the reality of government tougher than the theory of opposition. What is clear, though, is that the challenge is the same whether these countries elect new leaders or stick with the old ones: it is to combine the immediate task of detecting and punishing terrorism with the broader, longer-term tasks of blocking weapons proliferation and persuading the Muslim world to modernise. That will require a greater effort to capture al-Qaeda's fugitive leaders in Afghanistan and Pakistan, involving even more pressure on Pakistan's government to catch those terrorists and at the same time to prevent its own nuclear secrets from being sold to them or to other countries. It will require some new version of the tentative ""Greater Middle East Initiative"" for democratic reform just floated and then withdrawn by the Bush administration. And it will require a big new push on Israel and Palestine.
It is fashionable to argue that all this will require greater co-operation, on a multilateral basis, than the Bush administration has managed to achieve during the past three years, and more emphasis on the ""soft"" power of persuasion and influence. That is true, but it will also require military toughness, redoubled intelligence efforts and intensified security. This is no time for weakness or appeasement. That is the ultimate lesson from Madrid.",230,Spain,"Governments come and governments go, but the fight against terrorists must be stronger than ever
IF YOU carry out a well planned atrocity, killing more than 200 people and injuring more than a thousand, and three days later the government that supported an invasion to which you object is unexpectedly defeated in a general election, you are entitled to consider the venture to have been a success. So although Spain's high voting turnout on March 14th, and many Spaniards' apparent ire at the way Jose Mara Aznar's government had prematurely blamed Basque terrorists for the outrage, can be taken as healthily democratic signs ()see page 41, there is no escaping the fact that the biggest triumph has been that of the terrorists. Assuming, as is likely, that they are indeed linked to or are members of Osama bin Laden's al-Qaeda network, they scored another success when the new Socialist prime minister, Jose Luis Rodrguez Zapatero, said he would withdraw Spain's 1,300 troops from Iraq. This may only be a symbolic move, for that is a mere 1% of the American-led coalition's forces there, but symbols and emotions are what terrorism is all about.
To say all that is not to say that it is wrong to vote out governments that supported the invasion of Iraq a year ago. In some cases, such as Spain, they did so against a huge majority of public opinion. In all cases, their claims that Saddam Hussein had stockpiles of dangerous weapons now look to be a blunder, a gamble or a deception. This year both George Bush himself and John Howard, Australia's prime minister, face re-election contests and next year Britain's Tony Blair is also expected to do so. There is now a real possibility that all three could follow Mr Aznar's party into defeat--though Mr Blair may be saved by the fact that his Tory opposition supported the war strongly, too. Such defeats would be natural, in democratic terms. But the tragedy of Madrid is that the terrorists in effect cast the swing vote, given that Mr Aznar's party had looked set to win a comfortable victory, despite opposition to the war, and that such success may now stimulate more terrorism during the other three electoral campaigns. The big question, if such defeats occur, is whether successor governments would be more effective in pursuing al-Qaeda and stabilising the regions within which its terrorists thrive--or less.
One year on
Some critics of the war in Iraq say that there is no such danger. There was no genuine link between toppling Saddam and fighting al-Qaeda, so to punish governments for what opponents claim was an illegal invasion is a quite separate matter. Mr Zapatero even appears to think that pulling troops out of Iraq will make things better, on the view that the occupation is itself the cause of terrorism. Yet that policy is irresponsible, because it increases the risk of civil war in Iraq. Even those who opposed the war should now want to help make Iraq secure enough for Iraqis themselves to take back their sovereignty. If other new governments copy Mr Zapatero and prove their anti-war point by withdrawing from Iraq, they will make everyone less safe as a result. And it is a delusion to claim, as Mr Zapatero does, that all would be well if the UN were to take over from the Americans. Few Iraqis think so.

THE juxtaposition could hardly be sharper. On one side, a prosperous, stable economy and a chancellor brimming with confidence and certainty. On the other, profound insecurity, a growing sense of dread and a prime minister full of foreboding about a threat both ""real and existential"". 
In normal times, a budget intended to set the agenda for the next election would be a political event of the greatest importance. Gordon Brown's long stint at the Treasury has not been without fault, nor has he made the economy quite as immune from future shocks as he boasted when delivering his budget on March 17th. He also continues to be a good deal more optimistic about future tax revenues and a virtuous rebalancing of the economy away from consumption than most commentators are. But for all that, Mr Brown's success is the most solid achievement to which the government can lay claim. He has delivered growth that has not only been uninterrupted over the course of two parliaments, but has also been at a higher rate than in other big European countries. The question of whether he did that by luck or design is unlikely to trouble most voters. 
He has also achieved something matched by no other Labour chancellor: the funding of a large and sustained increase in spending without triggering a crisis in the public finances. Again, he can be criticised for the way he has gone about things, in particular his stubborn determination to pour huge sums of money into the sickly, capacity-constrained health service before the patient could fully absorb the medicine. But despite the waste and the scepticism it has bred, there is mounting evidence that the public services people care about most are slowly improving. And finally, Mr Brown has been a stealthy but effective champion of the poor. 
The chancellor's huge self-satisfaction may not be entirely attractive, but it is understandable. He believes he has established an economic platform from which it is almost unthinkable that Labour will lose the next election. But these are not normal times and, after the appalling events in Spain, thinking the hitherto unthinkable suddenly seems quite a reasonable thing to do. 
Ministers have, of course, been quick to explain why the bombings and the electoral earthquake which followed have changed nothing here. A few people may be less inclined than before to scoff at Tony Blair's apocalyptic warnings, repeated only a fortnight ago in a passionate defence by the prime minister of his policy on global terrorism. Far from being tormented by demons of his own imagining, as some had jeered, Mr Blair has been vindicated, albeit in a ghastly way. 
Many Spanish voters seem to have concluded that the decision to go to war in Iraq had made America's coalition partners more vulnerable to attack. This, say ministers, misses the point. The September 11th hijackers didn't need the Iraq war as a pretext. Besides, Britain, because of what it represents, has always been near the top of the al-Qaeda target list. No country, least of all Britain, can opt out of the war on terror. Nobody is under any illusion: no matter how much luck and skill you might have in combating the terrorists, something terrible is bound to happen at some stage. 
And if the worst does occur, say in London, the political fall-out will be less dramatic here. After all, the main opposition party unequivocally supported the war and still does. Britons were far less hostile to the war than were the Spanish: Britain remains fairly evenly divided over it, while in Spain over 90% thought it wrong. Anyway, ministers protest, the Spanish government made the fatal mistake of trying to gain political advantage from a terrorist outrage by pinning it on the wrong set of murderers: this government would never do that.
Like much else said about the war on terror, this is only partly convincing. In the first place, although there were strong arguments for the war in Iraq, among the weakest were those that claimed it was integral to the war on terror. Mr Blair deserves credit for being one of the first political leaders to understand how the world was changed by September 11th, and this newspaper thinks he was right to support America in getting rid of Saddam Hussein. But many people who are serious about fighting al-Qaeda quite reasonably ask whether invading Iraq helped or hindered that effort. Mr Blair's insistence on conflating the two does not help him. 
Bombs and ballots
Britain was indeed under threat before the bombs in Spain, but those bombs may well have increased the threat. The terrorists have seen how effectively their bombs can leverage unhappiness over the war. Mr Blair can't say it, but he knows that the response of Spanish voters and their new prime minister, Jose Luis Rodrguez Zapatero, to the assault on their society has made hitting Britain even more tempting to al-Qaeda.
Despite the official line, the possibility of a major terrorist spectacular during the election campaign is now being taken very seriously (although the lack of a fixed election date will hinder the terrorists' planning). But nobody can gauge what the political impact of such an attack would be. A poll carried out this week by YouGov for Sky News found that 75% believed that Britain's role in the Iraq war had made the country more vulnerable. However, with no plausible beneficiary of the voters' anger except the anti-war Liberal Democrats, the outcome of the election might well be unaffected. 
But what of Mr Blair? People believe, rightly, that Iraq was Mr Blair's war. Without his fervour and conviction, Britain might not have fought. If the bombs go off, how will they judge Mr Blair?

BY UNEXPECTEDLY returning the Socialists to power, the Spanish election on March 14th has delivered almost as big a shock to Spain, and the world, as the train bombings in Madrid did three days earlier. But, though many were quick to accuse Spanish voters of appeasement in the face of terror, the truth of what happened and what it means is more complex.
The March 11th bombings merit first attention. The death toll is now 201, making this the most savage attack that Spain has suffered since the civil war of 1936-39. At first it was blamed by the People's Party (PP) government of Jose Mara Aznar on the Basque terrorist group, ETA, which was known to be planning a spectacular outrage in Madrid. But all later evidence has pointed to Islamist terrorists, possibly linked to al-Qaeda (see next story).
The cack-handed attempt to blame ETA, combined with renewed doubts over Mr Aznar's support for the war in Iraq, turned the election round. Though the party's lead had been narrowing, opinion polls had pointed to a win for the PP, under Mr Aznar's hand-picked successor, Mariano Rajoy. In the event, the Socialists under Jose Luis Rodrguez Zapatero won 42.6% of the votes and 164 seats in the 350-seat Cortes, a big jump from the 125 it won in 2000. The PP got only 37.6% of the votes and 148 seats, down from 183 in 2000. Turnout rose to 77%, from 69% in 2000. 
The result sent tremors round the world, especially when Mr Zapatero's first announcement as prospective prime minister was that he would, as promised, withdraw Spanish troops from Iraq. He unceremoniously reproached George Bush and Tony Blair for going to war ""on the basis of lies"". And he promised a more emollient approach to old European Union allies, delighting France and Germany.
What caused the upheaval? A frightened and disorientated electorate voted with a knee-jerk reaction, said senior PP officials. The voters have done the work of al-Qaeda, some added bitterly. In that the bombings changed the result, they were right. But the underlying reasons may be less flattering to the PP.
The biggest was the three days when the government and the heavily state-influenced media insisted that ETA was the culprit. The assumption was that, if it was ETA, that would be good for the PP, as it would vindicate Mr Aznar's hardline stand against both terrorism and Basque separatism; but if it was an Islamic terrorist group, the PP would suffer, because 90% of Spaniards had opposed the war in Iraq. ""A critical point was reached in a spectacular way. We stressed for years: the PP are lying and distorting the truth. It took an important time, when people needed the truth, to discover the level of manipulation, and that day was March 11th,"" says Juan Fernando Lopez Aguilar, a confidant of Mr Zapatero and member of the Socialist Party's national executive. 
The second important factor was higher turnout. The emotional impact of the bombings seems to have persuaded many Spaniards to do their democratic duty and vote. Most were hitherto dormant Socialist supporters. As many as 2m were new young voters, who came of age during Mr Aznar's mishandling of the Prestige oil spill in 2002 and the subsequent war on Iraq. ""For the first time in 10-15 years, the majority of 18-30-year olds were voting for the Socialists, but again the message that people wanted change did not surface, because of the PP's stranglehold on the media,"" says Mr Lopez Aguilar.
Also, after eight years of the PP and a growing fatigue over Mr Aznar's authoritarian style, Mr Rajoy's chances of winning may never have been as sure as they looked. The bid to sell him as the same product but with an improved tone did not mobilise voters. The PP even began to believe its own propaganda. Strangely, so did everybody else: it was no secret that hardly anyone in the Socialist camp expected to win. Yet Mr Aznar was never as personally popular as his charismatic Socialist predecessor, Felipe Gonzlez. In a crisis, people proved ready to back away from him and his party.
In Catalonia and the Basque country, both the blaming of the bombings on ETA and Mr Aznar's fierce anti-regional rhetoric backfired spectacularly. His government demonised the Socialists when their coalition partner in the Catalan regional government, the Catalan Republican Left (ERC), was found to have done a secret deal that led ETA to declare a ceasefire limited to Catalonia. The ERC jumped to fourth political power in Spain, with eight seats in the Cortes, up from one in 2000. In Catalonia the Socialists won almost four times as many seats as the PP, which has now become almost a fringe party in the region. In the Basque country, the PP slumped from second to third, behind both PNV nationalists and Socialists. 
Mr Zapatero, known for his youth as Bambi, will form a minority government that will function, like some previous governments, by forming informal alliances with nationalist and left-wing parties. He lacks the fiery rhetoric of Mr Gonzlez, who was prime minister from 1982 to 1996. But his style is attractive after the years of bad blood created by Mr Aznar's high-handed manner.
In a marked change, Mr Zapatero telephoned the Basque leader, Juan Jose Ibarretxe, instantly restoring relations between Madrid and the region. Mr Aznar had not spoken to Mr Ibarretxe since 2001. Mr Zapatero's first statements on foreign policy signalled that Spain would return to its old loyalties in Europe (see Charlemagne) rather than its newer pro-American stance. He also wants to revive the notion of Spain as a link between Latin America and the EU.
Mr Zapatero's domestic policy is less clear. Before the election, he appointed a committee of notables who are a mixture of new savvy and safe old guard. According to his circle, Miguel Sebastin, who is not a party member, will be finance minister. An economist and a former banker, he wants to reduce government intervention in business, combat tax fraud and support innovation, research and development. But the new government may also reintroduce labour-market regulations that Mr Aznar had sensibly junked.
Elsewhere Jose Bono, regional president of Castile La Mancha and a party strongman, is expected to be security minister. Javier Solana may be recalled from Brussels to be foreign minister. Jesus Caldera, Mr Zapatero's right-hand man, will surely have a plum job; a grand old man of the left, Gregorio Peces Barba, could head the culture ministry; Mara Jess Sansegundo will get education.
Optimistic Socialist voters talk of a second democratic transition. Areas where Mr Aznar had failed to make improvements, such as government control of the powerful state media and Madrid's testy relations with the regions, may see early action. As crowds gathered to celebrate Mr Zapatero's victory in Madrid, hundreds of young people chanted: ""Don't let us down!"" No doubt he will try not to; but assuming office when his country has just been bloodied by international terrorists will present a huge challenge to an inexperienced prime minister.",230,Spain,"The surprise election victory of the Socialists, under Jose Luis Rodrguez Zapatero, has changed Spain's--and Europe's--political map

In the Basque country, the PP slumped from second to third, behind both PNV nationalists and Socialists. 
Mr Zapatero, known for his youth as Bambi, will form a minority government that will function, like some previous governments, by forming informal alliances with nationalist and left-wing parties. He lacks the fiery rhetoric of Mr Gonzlez, who was prime minister from 1982 to 1996. But his style is attractive after the years of bad blood created by Mr Aznar's high-handed manner.
In a marked change, Mr Zapatero telephoned the Basque leader, Juan Jose Ibarretxe, instantly restoring relations between Madrid and the region. Mr Aznar had not spoken to Mr Ibarretxe since 2001. Mr Zapatero's first statements on foreign policy signalled that Spain would return to its old loyalties in Europe (see Charlemagne) rather than its newer pro-American stance. He also wants to revive the notion of Spain as a link between Latin America and the EU.
Mr Zapatero's domestic policy is less clear. Before the election, he appointed a committee of notables who are a mixture of new savvy and safe old guard. According to his circle, Miguel Sebastin, who is not a party member, will be finance minister. An economist and a former banker, he wants to reduce government intervention in business, combat tax fraud and support innovation, research and development. But the new government may also reintroduce labour-market regulations that Mr Aznar had sensibly junked.
Elsewhere Jose Bono, regional president of Castile La Mancha and a party strongman, is expected to be security minister. Javier Solana may be recalled from Brussels to be foreign minister. Jesus Caldera, Mr Zapatero's right-hand man, will surely have a plum job; a grand old man of the left, Gregorio Peces Barba, could head the culture ministry; Mara Jess Sansegundo will get education.
Optimistic Socialist voters talk of a second democratic transition. Areas where Mr Aznar had failed to make improvements, such as government control of the powerful state media and Madrid's testy relations with the regions, may see early action. As crowds gathered to celebrate Mr Zapatero's victory in Madrid, hundreds of young people chanted: ""Don't let us down!"" No doubt he will try not to; but assuming office when his country has just been bloodied by international terrorists will present a huge challenge to an inexperienced prime minister.",,True

THE bombs that altered the course of the Spanish elections have also reshaped European politics. The departure of Jose Mara Aznar and his People's Party will shift the balance of power within the European Union. Broadly speaking, this is good for France and Germany, and bad for Britain and Poland. It is good for European federalists and bad for Eurosceptics and Atlanticists. In theory, it is good for the left and bad for the right, because conservatives were beaten by Socialists. But nominally left-wing governments in Britain and Poland are mourning, and a right-wing French government is cheering. Left-right divisions are no longer the chief determinant of tribal loyalties in Europe. It is attitudes to the United States and the future of the EU that matter now.
Mr Aznar's most crucial policy choice was to embrace America's war on terrorism and the toppling of Saddam Hussein. He chose this path partly for reasons internal to Spain, notably the long struggle against the Basque terrorist group, ETA. But he also believed that Spain, as a country on the rise, could aspire to be a global power, forging new alliances in the Americas and in Europe. Under the Socialist government of Felipe Gonzlez, he felt, Spain had too often passively followed a line determined by France and Germany.
Mr Aznar made little secret of his contempt for the ossified economies and leadership pretensions of the big two. He dismissed France's efforts to protect its language and film industry as a ""symptom of a culture in decline"". His most recent foreign minister, Ana Palacio, loudly deplored Franco-German efforts to dominate the EU. Such attitudes caused deep offence in Paris and Berlin (Mr Aznar had famously bad relations with both Jacques Chirac and Gerhard Schroder), but secretly delighted Britain's Tony Blair. 
The significance of the Aznar-inspired shift in Spanish thinking became most evident in the run-up to the Iraq war. The claim by France and Germany to speak for Europe was decisively undermined in January 2003 by the now-famous ""letter of eight"", a pro-American declaration by eight European governments--Britain, Italy, Poland, Portugal, Denmark, the Czech Republic, Hungary and Spain--that was co-ordinated by Mr Aznar's people. As well as being a gesture of support for the Bush administration, it had an undeclared sub-text about the EU. Henceforth France and Germany could no longer presume that, wherever they led, the rest of the EU would naturally follow.
Spain's Socialist Party always denounced this shift away from the big European powers and towards America. They drew strength from the fact that some 90% of Spanish people opposed the Iraq war. Jose Luis Rodrguez Zapatero, the Socialist leader who will now become prime minister, accused the Aznar government of serving only ""the interests of Bush"" and of betraying Spain's traditional commitment to ""pro-European"" policies. He had already sworn to restore previously ""magnificent"" relations with France and Germany.
Now that Spain has, in essence, switched sides within a divided Europe, this could tip the European Union's fragile power balance. One EU official goes so far as to say that ""with the disappearance of Aznar, the alternative pillar to France and Germany crumbles."" It certainly looks a lot weaker. Italy's Silvio Berlusconi, though pro-American, has a reputation for eccentricity and dodgy dealings that make him an alarming ally. He is also vulnerable to Spanish-style assaults from the anti-war left. Poland is a poor country, led by a weak and unstable government. The Dutch, Portuguese and Danes are not big enough to make a counterweight to the French, Germans and Spanish. Nor are the Hungarians or Czechs; some of their top diplomats have anyway long said privately that they had made a mistake in signing the ""letter of eight"". The upshot may be to leave Mr Blair isolated.
From A to Z
Europe is now waiting expectantly to see how Mr Zapatero's anti-war, pro-European rhetoric translates into actual policy. Even EU officials close to Mr Zapatero's party believe that he will have to ""get himself off the hook"" of campaign rhetoric that strayed into isolationism and pacifism. The highest-profile issue is, obviously, his pledge to pull Spanish troops out of Iraq if a new United Nations mandate is not forthcoming by the end of June. It may be that some form of ""internationalisation"" of the nation-building process in Iraq will allow Mr Zapatero to soften his position. Less remarked upon, so far, has been his party's commitment to cut Spain's already nugatory level of defence spending. This would dismay not just the Americans but also many of Spain's EU (and NATO) partners. 
European leaders will get a chance to assess Mr Zapatero at their summit in Brussels next week. This meeting had been expected to concentrate on economic reforms (the so-called ""Lisbon"" agenda, which Mr Aznar played a key role in devising), but it will now be overshadowed by terrorism and security issues. There have been calls for a European CIA, reflecting the instinct of federalists that, whatever the problem, ""more Europe"" is always the solution.
More significant may be confirmation that Mr Zapatero's arrival will make it a lot easier to agree the new EU constitution. It was largely Spanish and Polish objections to a new voting system--the ""double majority""--that scuppered efforts to strike a deal at December's EU summit. But Mr Zapatero has signalled that he will accept double majority, raising the prospect that the isolated Poles may have to fold. In fact, this concession was one that the Aznar government had already hinted at. But the new Spanish government may influence the constitution in other ways. The Socialists favour pan-European tax harmonisation, for instance; one more reason for Mr Blair and the British to regret the passing of Jose Mara Aznar.",230,Spain,"Spain's new government shifts the balance in the European Union

THE Bush administration did its best to take the Spanish election result in its stride. George Bush was one of the first world leaders to telephone Jose Luis Rodrguez Zapatero, Spain's prime-minister-elect, with his congratulations. Colin Powell insisted that ""the Spanish people remain committed to the war against terrorists"", while officials declared that they are offering Spain all the help they can to discover who was behind the bombings. 
Yet the election result is clearly a serious blow. The withdrawal of Spanish troops from Iraq, if it comes to that, will have little military significance: Spain has only 1,300 troops there, compared with Poland's 2,500 and America's 150,000. But the loss of Spanish support for Mr Bush has big diplomatic ramifications. 
Jose Mara Aznar's defeat not only removed the second-most-important American ally on Iraq after Britain's prime minister, Tony Blair. It also demonstrated that foreign leaders may pay a high price at home for their support for Mr Bush's war on terrorism. A year ago this week Mr Aznar stood at Mr Bush's side at a summit meeting in the Azores; now his country is led by a man who, during last October's Columbus Day military parade, made a point of sitting down as the American flag passed by, saying that ""It's not my flag.""
The fall of Spain's Popular Party severely limits the amount of pressure that America can put on its other allies, such as Britain and Poland. It also delivers a severe body-blow to American dreams of putting together a coalition of ""New European"" countries to counterbalance ""Old European"" places such as France and Germany (see page 48).
It is too early to judge what impact all this will have on the election race. The Democrats clearly have a good chance of using the Spanish election results to reinforce their claim that Mr Bush is alienating longstanding allies and thereby weakening the common stand on terrorism. But they need to handle this carefully. Howard Dean caused a furore when he told a group of reporters that Mr Bush's decision to send troops to Iraq contributed to the deaths in Madrid. The Kerry campaign immediately scrambled to dissociate itself from Mr Dean--and Democrats across the country offered thanks to God that they had not chosen him as their presidential candidate. 
Even if they can avoid Dean-style gaffes, the Spanish debacle poses two serious problems for the Democrats. The first is that anything that puts the spotlight back on terrorism strengthens Mr Bush. A recent Washington Post/ABC poll showed that Mr Kerry leads Mr Bush in eight policy areas, including the economy, education and health care; but Mr Bush leads Mr Kerry in the war on terrorism, by 21 points. 
On March 14th Dick Cheney told an audience in Florence, Kentucky, that the bombings in Spain were ""a reminder that there are evil people in the world, capable of any atrocity, and determined to take innocent life."" He also criticised Mr Kerry for regarding terrorism mainly as a matter of law enforcement rather than military action. ""He's embraced the strategy of the 1990s, which holds that when we are attacked, we ought to round up those directly responsible, put them on trial, and then call it a day.""
The second problem for the Democrats is that many Americans interpreted the Spanish election result as evidence that it is dangerous to put too much faith in foreign countries. Dennis Hastert, the House speaker, spoke for rank-and-file Republicans when he accused the Spanish of ""appeasement"". But this line of argument was not confined to Republicans. American newspapers were full of laments that the Spanish electorate had responded to the attacks in Madrid in exactly the way that the terrorists had hoped--and replaced a pro-American government with one that is much softer on terrorism. 
Edward Luttwak, a fierce critic of the war in Iraq, argued that the ""Zapateros of Europe"" are ""bent on validating the crudest caricatures of 'old European' cowardly decadence"". The more middle-of-the-road Washington Post wrote an editorial sharply critical of Romano Prodi's view that the events in Spain prove that force is not the answer to terrorism. ""Should such sentiments prevail,"" the Post argued, ""the next US administration--whether led by President Bush or Senator John F. Kerry--may have no alternative to unilateralism.""
A few days after the Spanish election result, a comprehensive study of global attitudes by the Pew Research Centre at the University of Maryland provided yet further evidence that, when it comes to fighting, America really is from Mars and Europe from Venus. America is the only country where a majority of people (60%) favour the war in Iraq. Support for that war has plummeted in America's closest ally, Britain, from 61% last May to 43% today--and remains negligible across western Europe. Many people in France (57%) and Germany (49%) believe that America is exaggerating the threat of terrorism. There is strong and growing support across Europe for the European Union becoming a powerful counterweight to America. 
Whether all this really leaves America with no alternative to unilateralism may be open to doubt. But both the United States and Europe clearly have a great deal of work to do if they are not to see transatlantic solidarity against Islamic terrorism dissolving in fratricidal dissent.",230,Spain,"Yet more reason to worry about those Europeans

AFTER months on the back foot, the government led by the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) has regained the tactical advantage before a general election that Taro Aso, Japan's prime minister, has to call by September. The government is betraying a measure of competence in the face of the county's abrupt economic slowdown. In particular, the extra budget which the finance minister, Kaoru Yosano, unveiled in April could provide a useful stimulus of 2-3% of GDP in ways not very beholden to the party's usual interests. Mr Aso's approval ratings have risen from abysmal lows, helped by his robust stance in the face of a rocket that North Korea fired over Japan on April 5th.
Yet Mr Aso has benefited most from the main opposition leader, Ichiro Ozawa, wreaking damage on his own Democratic Party of Japan (DPJ). In March Tokyo prosecutors indicted his political secretary, Takanori Okubo, for accepting illegal funds from a construction company with a history of lining politicians' pockets. Mr Ozawa has since neither resigned nor backed up his claim to be as pure as driven snow. Until the scandal, the general election looked likely to be a walkover for the DPJ, sweeping away a political system that has kept the LDP in near continuous power for more than half a century. Now voters are turning against Mr Ozawa. Two-thirds of those asked say he should resign.
For some in the DPJ, this is the realisation of a long-feared nightmare. For years, even when he used to be in the LDP, Mr Ozawa saw Japan's need for competitive two-party politics. He has long vowed to bring such a system about. Yet the scandal is a reminder that his politics remain an old-fashioned mix of money and power to bring home the bacon to his base in north-eastern Honshu, Japan's main island. Few DPJ modernisers openly decry his style because his efforts have also transformed a party of the urban middle class into a national force with broad rural support.
With the opposition in disarray, Mr Aso has the luxury of choice. Either he can push the stimulus through the lower house of the Diet (parliament) in May and then call a snap election--colleagues favour June 7th. Or he can bide his time in the hope of seeing DPJ anguish worsen. Prosecutors may present more details of Mr Okubo's case in June, after which the options for Mr Ozawa may narrow. Mr Aso also appears to crave the prestige of attending the G8 summit in Italy in July. Tokyo metropolitan elections that month will command all the energies of the LDP's junior coalition partner, New Komeito. So Mr Aso may favour an August election. For now, he is keeping his own counsel.
Diminishing prospects of a clear victory for the opposition DPJ, which controls the Diet's upper house, have led to a return of talk of a post-election ""grand coalition"" to break the deadlock. This is the favoured solution of the establishment's dinosaurs--octogenarian newspaper publishers and former prime ministers--who think that they should be arranging the affairs of state and who constantly meddle in politics as kingmakers. It is a solution proposed briefly by Mr Ozawa in late 2007, much to the horror of his party. But it does little to further the hope that politics might become more accountable.
The DPJ's agony over Mr Ozawa has yet to show itself in public. If he goes, he may intend to hand over to the party's secretary-general, Yukio Hatoyama, and then wield power from behind the throne. Yet many will call for someone outside the Ozawa orbit to lead the party, in which case Katsuya Okada, a 55-year-old former leader, is the favourite. The upright Mr Okada says that the DPJ should take two issues to the enemy's camp in the election campaign: ending the baneful practice, so common in the LDP, of political seats becoming inherited family sinecures, and banning all corporate donations. 
The second of these issues might look awfully like an attack on Mr Ozawa. Yet Mr Okada shies from launching an open challenge. He says that half of his constituents berate him for being hard on Mr Ozawa, while the other half urge him to contest the leadership. Yet, typical of Mr Okada's ambivalence, he insists Mr Ozawa himself is all for banning corporate donations. An open split, says Mr Okada, who led the DPJ to abject defeat in the previous election, ""would ruin our chances of taking over the government."" So might the DPJ's dithering over the future of Mr Ozawa, not for nothing called ""the Destroyer"".

THERE is no revolution at the barricades, and on an early-summer Sunday the homeless in Tokyo's Yoyogi park form a polite long queue for the bento (packed lunch) boxes being handed out by a schoolgirl from a local church: the deepest bows come from those at the back who go away empty-handed. Yet as far as the problems of a rich country go, it is hard to exaggerate Japan's.
The global slump has hit the economy far harder than the famous bursting of its bubble did two decades ago. Government debt stands at twice the economy's annual output, dwarfing even Italy's. The export-led growth which drove a six-year recovery after 2002 has proved a chimera. Now, as Japan's 127m-strong population is set to fall, some predict, by more than a third over the next few decades, the working-age population will fall fastest, before a way has been found to pay for all the grey heads. Yet, under a nutty-sounding new policy the government is quietly bribing South American immigrants of Japanese extraction to return home for good. Other solutions to the crisis proposed by members of the ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) include creating a brand-new currency, with which to flood the economy. Much else about the LDP is either crackpot or forlorn, suggesting that Japan's problems are political at root. And now, for the first time in Japan's post-war history, an opposition offers a feasible alternative to the LDP, which has run Japan for all but ten months since 1955. 
Until this week, however, which brought the resignation of Ichiro Ozawa, imperious leader of the opposition Democratic Party of Japan (DPJ), that feasibility had once again been in doubt. Victory in the general election, which the prime minister, Taro Aso, is bound to call by September, was the DPJ's to lose. Mr Ozawa seemed determined to lose it. Not for nothing is he known as ""the Destroyer"". This spring he was implicated in a fund-raising scandal, in which an aide was indicted for receiving illegal donations from a construction company. That went down poorly with voters, underscoring how much Mr Ozawa's politics were still rooted in the murk of back rooms. 
The 66-year-old Mr Ozawa had started out in the LDP, where his rise was as astounding as the quantities of enemies he made. Earlier than any politician, he had articulated the need for political reform and for Japan to come out from under its pacifist constitution to chart a more ""normal"" course in foreign affairs, shouldering more of the burden of its own defence. He defected from the LDP in 1993 and, as the DPJ's head, has turned the party into a national force not just among the urban middle classes but in rural regions too. The strategy paid off in 2007, when the party won control of the upper house of the Diet (parliament), throwing the LDP into disarray. It is on its third prime minister since.
The latest scandal, however, had turned Mr Ozawa into an electoral liability for the DPJ. Stepping down may prove to be a rare constructive act in the Destroyer's career. His successor will present a fresh start in promoting a reformist agenda of fixing the pension and health systems, providing jobs and making government and bureaucracy more accountable. 
""Fresh"", however, is hardly the apt term for the two contenders for the leadership, to be decided on May 16th. One, Yukio Hatoyama, the secretary-general, is closely associated with the former leader and will be backed by Mr Ozawa's henchmen. Mr Ozawa himself may expect to wield more power from behind the throne than on it. The other, Katsuya Okada, led the DPJ to a crushing defeat in 2005 by the LDP under its former prime minister, Junichiro Koizumi. Fatally, he opposed Mr Koizumi's popular plans to privatise the postal-savings system. Both DPJ contenders are charisma-light insiders. But at least Mr Okada, who has admitted his 2005 electoral blunder, has hit a nerve in promising to campaign against the practice, common among LDP political families, of treating Diet seats as heritable sinecures. Over half Mr Aso's cabinet are the offspring of former politicians. Searching for the new
Even so, the DPJ hardly offers a clean break with the sordid past. Like its predecessor as pretender to the LDP's crown, the Socialist Party, it has tended to be a rather tame opposition. Many of its members, indeed, are ex-Socialists. Others, Mr Hatoyama and Mr Okada included, are from the LDP. Mr Hatoyama has a brother in the cabinet. His grandfather, Ichiro Hatoyama, was an LDP founding father and arch-rival to Japan's most notable prime minister after the war, Shigeru Yoshida. Mr Yoshida, as it happens, was Mr Aso's grandfather, so this summer's election may play out as family rivalry. Further, the political careers of both Mr Hatoyama and Mr Okada have been bankrolled by immense family fortunes, just like those of many in the LDP. Plus ca change.
With Mr Ozawa gone, establishment meddlers, such as retired prime ministers and media magnates, will redouble efforts to get the LDP to propose a post-election ""grand coalition"" with the DPJ. After all, many have long viewed it as merely an errant LDP faction. Elsewhere, modernisers within the LDP are pondering defecting to the DPJ. Given the DPJ's inexperience--one reason why it depended so on Mr Ozawa--they might be welcome.
So the big test facing the DPJ is to dispel the suspicion that politics in Japan, more than any other rich democracy, is a top-down business arranged by a self-selecting elite, which rarely informs the public of its actions, much less consults them. Voters, of course, have in part themselves to blame for this. To date, they have too readily accepted what they are given, even when the political bento boxes prove empty. When they line up at the ballot boxes this summer, a resounding vote for the DPJ would show Japanese politicians they are accountable after all, and offer a chance to see if the DPJ can keep its promises.

THE Japanese public received a rare glimpse of parliamentary debate on May 27th, when Yukio Hatoyama, the new head of Japan's main opposition, the Democratic Party of Japan (DPJ), squared off against Taro Aso, the prime minister and head of the ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP). With an election to be called by September, at which the LDP is expected to lose power after 54 years of almost uninterrupted rule, this duel had been awaited eagerly. Many considered it an appetiser for an unusually engrossing Japanese election campaign. Moreover, the battle had history: Messrs Hatoyama and Aso are grandsons of two former Japanese prime ministers who were themselves bitter rivals.
Yet the leaders personified their parties' shortcomings, with Mr Aso as the haughty old pro against Mr Hatoyama, a naive idealist. ""A politics of friendship and love,"" is how the 62-year-old Mr Hatoyama described his political ideal. Mr Aso flashed a characteristic sneer at this, but volunteered no alternative vision. 
In a negative way, the two leaders also represent the country's disaffection with politics. More than half of Japanese want neither for their next prime minister, according to an opinion poll commissioned by Nikkei, a newspaper. But Mr Hatoyama, whom 29% of respondents opted for, came off better than Mr Aso, whom only 16% wanted as their leader. That was a big improvement for the DPJ on the ratings of their previous leader, Ichiro Ozawa, who resigned on May 11th after a fund-raising scandal involving his main political aide. A survey conducted in April found that only 9% wished to be led by Mr Ozawa. 
But the memory of his leadership still haunts the DPJ and may damage its electoral prospects. Mr Ozawa arranged for Mr Hatoyama, a loyal lieutenant, to be his successor. Upon taking the reins he returned the favour by asking Mr Ozawa to oversee the party's election strategy. So Mr Ozawa--who is said to have kept control over the DPJ's budget, personnel appointments and policy decisions--has retained a good deal of his former power even as he has sought to escape the glare of public scrutiny. For example, he has stopped calling the weekly press conferences that top party officials routinely hold. 
Whether Mr Hatoyama will emerge as his own man or a puppet of Mr Ozawa is unclear. He may feel that since he does not represent the clean break that voters hoped for, he should promulgate a more reformist agenda than his predecessor did. Meanwhile he may spend much energy holding his party together; a jumble of former leftist politicians, bankers and bureaucrats, it is sorely divided.
If neither party wins a decent majority in the election, there may be more of this complexity, with both looking to bolster themselves with support from smaller parties--or breakaway factions of each other. The man Mr Hatoyama beat to lead the DPJ (but who is preferred by voters), Katsuya Okada, is already scouring Japan's smaller parties for potential allies. 
The LDP is also readying for battle. It recently issued its parliamentarians with a three-volume manual on such matters as ""using manners to win people's hearts"", which urges members to practise smiling in front of a mirror each day. If its advice can help Mr Aso refrain from sniggering during future debates, it would be welcome, with leaders of both parties hoping to see these take place twice a month. Regular debates would represent a refreshing change in Japanese politics. If they were to involve discussion of serious issues, so much the better; but on past form that is sadly a lot to hope for.

PANIC is palpable among legislators of the ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP). Japan is on the verge of an historic change of government. A general election for the Diet (parliament) must be called by mid-September, after which power is expected to pass to the decade-old opposition, the Democratic Party of Japan (DPJ), after more than 50 years of almost uninterrupted LDP rule.
But the ruling party is not going gracefully. A gaggle of younger LDP parliamentarians is agitating to bring forward the selection of party president set for September in a clumsy attempt to replace the prime minister, Taro Aso, before the election. In recent days a few party elders have also called for him to step aside. Talk of ousting Mr Aso makes the LDP look desperate: he would be the fourth prime minister to quit in as many years.
To quell the rebellious rabble and offer fresher faces to voters, Mr Aso considered a big cabinet reshuffle (shades of Britain's Gordon Brown). On July 1st, however, he chose a much more modest course, filling two posts that had previously been handled by ministers who had taken on multiple roles following the resignations of other cabinet members.
The cosmetic nature of the change reinforces the perception that the LDP is flailing. Dissatisfaction has been brewing for a decade and a half, though a plethora of hapless opposition parties has failed to do more than briefly interrupt LDP rule (for an 11-month stint in 1993-94). One former prime minister, Junichiro Koizumi, even won his mandate in 2001-06 after vowing to ""destroy"" his own party.
In the end, it will probably be Mr Aso's mediocre performance that administers the coup de grace. In opinion polls in mid June, the prime minister's popularity sank below 20% after enjoying a brief lift following a fund-raising scandal that forced the DPJ's leader to resign. Now, new fund-raising scandals threaten both parties. Two members of Mr Aso's cabinet have been accused of accepting illegal donations. And the DPJ's new leader, Yukio Hatoyama, has had to apologise after it was revealed that his political organisation listed deceased and fictitious people as donors. In polls, voters prefer the DPJ to the LDP by almost two to one. But around half the public prefers neither party.
One bellwether for the national election are municipal contests, in particular the Tokyo assembly election to be held on July 12th. This is especially important because the assembly is the power base of the LDP's coalition partner, New Komeito, which gives the party its majority. The dps has won a string of local contests in recent weeks, with significantly increased turnouts. Where national politicians are reviled, a new breed of local ones has captivated voters.
It is hardly surprising that the electorate is turning against the governing party. Quite apart from public displeasure at the entire political class, Japan is expected to be the hardest hit of rich economies this year: its GDP is forecast to contract by 6%, around twice the level of America or Britain. True, the Bank of Japan's Tankan survey of sentiment among large manufacturers showed the biggest improvement in two and a half years on July 1st--to minus 48 from a record minus 58 in March. Yet the negative figures suggest economic recovery will be slow and difficult. The LDP's electoral prospects are not much rosier.","The ruling LDP plays a sloppy endgame

In recent days a few party elders have also called for him to step aside . Talk of ousting Mr Aso makes the LDP look desperate : he would be the fourth prime minister to quit in as many years . 
 To quell the rebellious rabble and offer fresher faces to voters , Mr Aso considered a big cabinet reshuffle ( shades of Britain 's Gordon Brown ) . On July 1st , however , he chose a much more modest course , filling two posts that had previously been handled by ministers who had taken on multiple roles following the resignations of other cabinet members . 
 The cosmetic nature of the change reinforces the perception that the LDP is flailing . Dissatisfaction has been brewing for a decade and a half , though a plethora of hapless opposition parties has failed to do more than briefly interrupt LDP rule ( for an 11 - month stint in 1993 - 94 ) . One former prime minister , Junichiro Koizumi , even won his mandate in 2001 - 06 after vowing to "" destroy "" his own party . 
 In the end , it will probably be Mr Aso 's mediocre performance that administers the coup de grace . In opinion polls in mid June , the prime minister 's popularity sank below 20 % after enjoying a brief lift following a fund - raising scandal that forced the DPJ 's leader to resign . Now , new fund - raising scandals threaten both parties . Two members of Mr Aso 's cabinet have been accused of accepting illegal donations . And Yukio Hatoyama's has had to apologise after it was revealed that Yukio Hatoyama's political organisation listed deceased and fictitious people as donors . In polls , voters prefer the DPJ to the LDP by almost two to one . But around half the public prefers neither party . 
 One bellwether for the national election are municipal contests , in particular the Tokyo assembly election to be held on July 12th . This is especially important because the assembly is the power base of the LDP 's coalition partner , New Komeito , which gives the party its majority . The dps has won a string of local contests in recent weeks , with significantly increased turnouts . Where national politicians are reviled , a new breed of local ones has captivated voters . 
 It is hardly surprising that the electorate is turning against the governing party . Quite apart from public displeasure at the entire political class , Japan is expected to be the hardest hit of rich economies this year : its GDP is forecast to contract by 6 % , around twice the level of America or Britain . True , the Bank of Japan 's Tankan survey of sentiment among large manufacturers showed the biggest improvement in two and a half years on July 1st -- to minus 48 from a record minus 58 in March . Yet the negative figures suggest economic recovery will be slow and difficult . The LDP 's electoral prospects are not much rosier .",740,Japan,A30-186,PRE TERM,True,"the DPJ 's new leader , Yukio Hatoyama ,",2,True

HIS distraught colleagues cannot forgive Taro Aso for calling a general election on August 30th, following a dismal stint as prime minister. They accuse him of setting up the opposition Democratic Party of Japan (DPJ) for a landslide victory, so bringing the long rule of the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) to an abrupt and ignominious end. 
Yet the question is not why the LDP's rule looks about to end soon. Rather it is how on earth the party managed to cling on to power for so long. A once-invincible party failed to adapt to wholesale changes in the social and economic model that it was set up to manage. If its 54-year rule really does come to a halt, that fact alone will confront both party and country with wrenching change and unprecedented uncertainty.
Few things more powerfully demonstrate the inbred character of LDP-dominated politics than its family background. Mr Aso's grandfather, Shigeru Yoshida, was the great statesman of shattered Japan's post-war reconstruction. Yoshida's rule came to an end in 1954 when he was unseated as prime minister by his nemesis, Ichiro Hatoyama. The next year the two men joined forces and the Liberal Party merged with the Japan Democratic Party to form the Liberal Democratic Party, which has dominated Japan's politics ever since. The man who will bring the LDP's rule to an end this summer is Hatoyama's grandson, Yukio Hatoyama, leader of the DPJ. Family honour is demanding its due: for Shigeru Yoshida's grandson, it is nobler to fall to Ichiro Hatoyama's descendant than to succumb to mere LDP hoplites. In any case, Mr Aso knows no one can save his party now.
That is because its history runs so deep. Old Hatoyama and Yoshida formed the LDP as a bulwark against resurgent socialist parties and the political system they devised seems expressly designed to resist change. The American occupiers had anyway pushed Japan in a conservative direction as early as 1948, when the risk of communist revolution in Japan and China--to say nothing of the Soviet threat--had come to be seen as a greater peril than militarism. The Korean war reinforced these priorities, while adding an economic dimension: the United States needed Japan's economy to be humming again to help the war effort.
Thus developed Japan's characteristic mix of anti-communist--even anti-civic--politics with state-directed development and policy set by bureaucrats. Yoshida founded the Ministry for International Trade and Industry, MITI, whose bureaucrats were famously powerful. Trust-busting efforts were quickly wound down after the second world war. Oligopolies--in the form of the former zaibatsu conglomerates--were supported, even if they had been implicated in Japanese aggression. A man accused of war crimes became a notable post-war prime minister and Yakuza gang bosses consorted with top politicians and helped put down left-wing protests. The political and bureaucratic system was solidly made and has lasted, like so many things in Japan. But its origins, and its effects on Japan, were ultimately rotten.
In some countries--Italy, say--incestuous politics is resented, mocked or circumvented by the rest of the country. During Japan's boom years, it seemed to be delivering the goods. Outside the radical left, most Japanese were bought off by a social contract in which politicians, bureaucrats and big business arranged the country's economic affairs. Businesses won preferential finance and in return offered ""salarymen"" job guarantees and the dream of a middle-class life. But the contract could be honoured only with high rates of growth, and the oil shocks of the early 1970s put paid to these.
Perhaps this might have been the end of the LDP, but political competition had been so stifled that there was nothing to take the party's place. Instead, the crisis of the 1970s led to a steep rise in corruption. Factional competition within the party increased. Fund-raising skills came to the fore (in Japan, like America, politicians mostly finance their own campaigns). So did the ability to fund public works in rural areas that were still the LDP's base. Corruption cemented local baronies and for a good while won votes. Even today the late Kakuei Tanaka, an astonishingly corrupt prime minister, is more often praised than cursed.
The beginning of the end
A 19th-century Russian said that Europe's democracies were moderated by corruption. Japan had corruption moderated by democracy. During the 1980s, the LDP managed to adapt itself somewhat to new political concerns, such as pollution and the success of issue-driven opposition figures in cities and prefectures. The party even lost power briefly in 1993 and, in 2001-06, a razzle-dazzle prime minister, Junichiro Koizumi, seemed to be giving it a new lease on life. 
But by the time Mr Koizumi came along, the tension had become intolerable between the change-resisting features of politics on the one hand, and the reality of profound economic and social upheaval on the other. Companies could no longer keep lifetime promises to workers yet the government failed to take over social-welfare obligations. Women wanted better work prospects yet ministers would refer to them as ""breeding machines"". The demands of civic groups for more consumer protection were met grudgingly and late.
Now, the LDP has abandoned nearly all pretence at reform. Though the party has plenty of modernisers, many--notably the so-called Koizumi's children--will be the first to be swept out on August 30th while the old guard may survive better because they have their own sources of funding and support. That the LDP is still so mired in the past shows both why its fall would be such an historic moment and why it would also be only the start of real change. The party was the keystone of a political system that has long been crumbling. To effect change means not just replacing the keystone but painstakingly rebuilding the arch.","Japan has long been changing faster than its Liberal Democratic Party , which is now in terminal decline

THE best thing about the new campaign manifesto of the Democratic Party of Japan (DPJ) is not what it says but that it exists at all. Voters in post-war Japan have been denied much of a voice by one-party politics. But on July 27th the opposition DPJ set out a ""contract"" with the electorate that it wants to be taken as a binding list of policies it will pursue if, as seems likely, the voters make history next month by breaking the Liberal Democratic Party's near-monopoly on power. Anyone who wants Japan to cast off its 20-year economic funk will welcome that. But the DPJ will succeed only if its leaders also take the next, bolder step--and scrap the country's ""iron triangle"" of lobbies, political barons and bureaucrats.
Barely a year ago the DPJ looked unfit to lead Japan. Its domestic policies were incoherent and unfunded, its foreign policy worryingly anti-American, its members an odd coalition of socialists and exiles from the LDP. All it had done since winning control of the Diet's upper house in July 2007 had been to block the LDP. Its then leader, Ichiro Ozawa, secretly plotted to form a grand coalition with the ruling party, lamenting that his own lot ""lacked credibility"".
Nothing sobers you up like responsibility. The DPJ has now backed away from some of its worst gimmicks. The manifesto unveiled by its new boss, Yukio Hatoyama, has sensible ideas, like cutting the elaborate system of state handouts and using a consumption tax to move the pension system away from companies, which the state shields from failure partly because of their role in dishing out social payments. Electing the DPJ is still plainly a risk: the party is inexperienced and, like the LDP, an improbably broad church. But it no longer looks foolish.
However, the DPJ will achieve little unless it also tackles Japan's fearsome bureaucracy. During decades of LDP rule, large parts of government were subcontracted to the civil service. Bureaucrats worked with powerful party bosses and industrial lobbies to set the agenda, flesh out policy--and neuter any reform that threatened their narrow interests. Even Junichiro Koizumi, the most charismatic and reform-minded of all the LDP prime ministers, struggled to get things done. With an electorate wary of rapid change and a system designed to frustrate it, Japan has rejected the reform it needs.
Reassuringly, the DPJ acknowledges the struggle ahead (see
). Its central promise in this week's manifesto is to show ""the bureaucrats who is boss"". But that calls for two things. The first is a combination of coaxing and courage. Coaxing because a new government will have to spot the bureaucrats who want reform (they do exist) and enlist their help. And courage because the system will fight back by spreading poison, just as it did the only other time the LDP lost power, for a brief 11 months in 1993-94, when civil servants colluded with their old bosses to discredit the new government. Tokyo temptation
The second thing the DPJ needs is self-restraint. Its own people will be tempted to practise politics the old-fashioned way, by pulling strings outside the cabinet and working in league with the bureaucracy. Nobody is more dangerous than the former leader, Mr Ozawa--brilliant, unpredictable and a black belt in the dark arts of manipulation. The wisest thing Mr Hatoyama can do is to insist that his more impressive predecessor join the cabinet, where he should do least harm.
It is a tall order to expect the DPJ to reinvent the machinery of government overnight, or even in the four years it says it needs. But the party's reward would be great and the reward for Japan would be greater still: a two-party system that can at last begin to hold wayward politicians to account.","Breaking the mould of Japanese politics requires tackling the country 's domineering civil service

WITH an election due on August 30th, an animated cartoon has proved a surprise internet hit in Japan. At a candlelit dinner, a smooth-talking suitor with wavy locks like the opposition leader's leans over and whispers to his companion, ""I can make you happier, why not switch to me,"" promising her a worry-free life blessed by free child-care and a generous retirement. How will you pay for all this, she wonders? ""Don't worry,"" he purrs. ""I'll sort out the details once we're married.""
This is Japan's first taste of attack advertising. The cartoon's sponsor, the ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP), may be a shambles, empty of ideas and brought low by in-fighting, but its ruthless political instincts have not deserted it after half a century of nearly unbroken rule. It accuses the left-leaning Democratic Party of Japan (DPJ) of being both callow and extreme, fit neither to oversee Japan's security alliance with the United States, nor to protect the nation's rocky finances. 
The charge of inexperience may not stick. Given the sleaze and incompetence of the mightily experienced LDP, which has produced four prime ministers in as many years, freshness has a certain appeal. The second charge, of extremism, though, may yet damage the DPJ. So on foreign policy, the opposition is tacking to the centre. In the past, its leader, Yukio Hatoyama, has questioned parts of the security alliance with America and the role of Japanese forces abroad. Two years ago, having won control of the upper house of the Diet (parliament), the DPJ claimed the scalp of a prime minister, Shinzo Abe, by attacking the Japanese navy's refuelling mission in the Indian Ocean, there to support anti-terror operations in Afghanistan. The mission, it said, breached the country's pacifist constitution. Now ""continuity"" is Mr Hatoyama's watchword. To recall the mission ""would be a very reckless idea."" The alliance, he now says, must not be rocked.
Yet the election will be won or lost on domestic matters. In its election manifesto, issued on July 27th, the party promises to address Japan's deep-seated economic insecurities. It will introduce a child allowance, cut road tolls and taxes on small businesses, raise unemployment benefits, support farmers' incomes and revamp a pension system that cannot keep up with an ageing population. More than anything, the pensions mess brought the LDP low (it lost 50m pensions records).
The opposition's proposals amount to 3.5% of GDP and paying for them seems to depend on more than a sprinkle of fairy gold. More than {Yen}9 trillion ($95 billion), the party says, will be found in savings from public works and other wasteful spending. The party rules out raising Japan's 5% consumption tax for at least four years, though that is key to turning round the dire public finances. Gross national debt is 180% of GDP and rising, as LDP stimulus packages--justified by the global slump--kick in. 
Whether the DPJ's sums add up at this stage, however, matters less than its ability to carry out its main campaign promise: wholesale ""administrative reform"". This bland phrase amounts to a revolution. The party promises ""rule by politicians not by bureaucrats"", something that did not happen during the LDP's decades in office. Unlike in other democracies, power in Japan has rarely resided in the government of the day. Rather, influential bureaucrats have worked with ""tribes"" of politicians to protect the interests of road builders, construction companies, farmers and other lobbies. In addition, ministries control special funds of their own, so the cabinet's hold over the national purse strings is weak. Policymaking bodies within the LDP itself have further undermined the authority of the prime minister. In the latest general election, in 2005, the then prime minister, Junichiro Koizumi, challenged the system by appealing directly to voters. He won by a landslide. But even before he resigned in 2006, the system was reasserting itself.
The DPJ's plans are much more radical than Mr Koizumi's. The cabinet will be responsible for the planning and execution of policy. Bureaucrats will be made accountable to their minister, and discipline enforced by putting more politicians into ministries. The budget-making process will be centralised, and items scrutinised line by line. The party's secretary-general, Katsuya Okada, says severing all connections with the bureaucratic habits of the past will be a prerequisite for carrying out the DPJ's other election promises.
That is probably correct but the question is whether so bold a reform is believable. The manifesto is central to the DPj's credibility. That, in itself, is a first for Japan. The manifesto proposes a four-year programme for sorting out state pensions and rationalising the budget. Akira Nagatsuma, the DPJ's pensions supremo, says a copy of the programme will be posted in every government office, ""a reminder to bureaucrats that this is the government's contract with the people."" If the party pushes through its programmes, party members say, then it will ask voters in four years' time to approve the rise in the consumption tax that will presumably be needed. Should a tax increase be necessary before then, Mr Okada says, the prime minister should resign and call a fresh election. Manifesto destiny
If the DPJ wins (and it is ahead in opinion polls, see chart on previous page), it can expect dogged resistance from the LDP and its bureaucratic allies. Even if it can defeat such campaigns--and it should get some help from modernising bureaucrats, who say they look forward to working under its proposed changes--two big uncertainties remain. One is that in addressing economic insecurities, the party appears concerned with redistribution at the expense of boosting long-run potential. Beyond a nod towards things like green technologies and nursing homes, the party appears to give little thought to increasing growth, allocating resources better or dealing with stubborn deflation.
The second uncertainty has to do with the role of the DPJ figure who towers over all his colleagues, Mr Hatoyama included: Ichiro Ozawa, once an LDP bigwig, then DPJ leader who was forced by a funding scandal to step down as party leader in the spring. Mr Ozawa is a bundle of contradictions. For nearly two decades he has worked to bring about a political upheaval in which LDP-led rule is replaced by a competitive two-party system. He may succeed at last. At the same time, Mr Ozawa, an electoral strategist of genius, learnt from his years in the LDP to play politics behind the scenes. In the Diet he comes across as dour. In private his quicksilver manner can charm colleagues or just as quickly destroy them. By temperament, Mr Ozawa would rather not sit in the cabinet, accountable to the prime minister. But that informal style of politics is just what the DPJ promises to break with. Should the DPJ win on August 30th, what Mr Hatoyama does with Mr Ozawa will be the first test of whether the party can bring Japan's politics out of the shadows.","The DPJ lays out its credentials for governing

The party 's secretary - general , Katsuya Okada , says severing all connections with the bureaucratic habits of the past will be a prerequisite for carrying out the DPJ 's other election promises . 
 That is probably correct but the question is whether so bold a reform is believable . The manifesto is central to the DPj 's credibility . That , in itself , is a first for Japan . The manifesto proposes a four - year programme for sorting out state pensions and rationalising the budget . Akira Nagatsuma , the DPJ 's pensions supremo , says a copy of the programme will be posted in every government office , "" a reminder to bureaucrats that this is the government 's contract with the people . "" If the party pushes through its programmes , party members say , then it will ask voters in four years ' time to approve the rise in the consumption tax that will presumably be needed . Should a tax increase be necessary before then , Mr Okada says , the prime minister should resign and call a fresh election . Manifesto destiny 
 If the DPJ wins ( and it is ahead in opinion polls , see chart on previous page ) , it can expect dogged resistance from the LDP and its bureaucratic allies . Even if it can defeat such campaigns -- and it should get some help from modernising bureaucrats , who say they look forward to working under its proposed changes -- two big uncertainties remain . One is that in addressing economic insecurities , the party appears concerned with redistribution at the expense of boosting long - run potential . Beyond a nod towards things like green technologies and nursing homes , the party appears to give little thought to increasing growth , allocating resources better or dealing with stubborn deflation . 
 The second uncertainty has to do with the role of the DPJ figure who towers over all his colleagues , Mr Hatoyama included : Ichiro Ozawa , once an LDP bigwig , then DPJ leader who was forced by a funding scandal to step down as party leader in the spring . Mr Ozawa is a bundle of contradictions . For nearly two decades he has worked to bring about a political upheaval in which LDP - led rule is replaced by a competitive two - party system . He may succeed at last . At the same time , Mr Ozawa , an electoral strategist of genius , learnt from his years in the LDP to play politics behind the scenes . In the Diet he comes across as dour . In private his quicksilver manner can charm colleagues or just as quickly destroy them . By temperament , Mr Ozawa would rather not sit in the cabinet , accountable to the prime minister . But that informal style of politics is just what the DPJ promises to break with . Should the DPJ win on August 30th , what Yukio Hatoyama does with Mr Ozawa will be the first test of whether the party can bring Japan 's politics out of the shadows .",740,Japan,A30-186,PRE TERM,True,"its leader , Yukio Hatoyama ,",4,True

ONE of the longest leases on power in the post-war era looks likely to end on August 30th. In Japan's curiously genteel election campaign, opinion polls indicate that the ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) is heading for defeat. This would only be good for Japan. The LDP, in power almost without interruption since 1955, is a cold-war relic. Its days have been numbered since the collapse of the Berlin Wall coincided with the bursting of Japan's bubble economy.
What good the party did in helping build one of the world's mightiest and most egalitarian industrial nations is now almost ancient history. In recent years it has played a sordid game, lavishing favours on those--such as exporters, builders and farmers--whose votes and money have kept it in power. Its unseemly ties with the country's famously conservative bureaucracy have prevented it from tackling Japan's pressing social problems. In an ageing society where many pensioners are refreshingly sprightly, the ruling party looks utterly clapped-out.
A pity then that the party that looks likely to win the most seats in the lower house, the Democratic Party of Japan (DPJ), looks so callow and ill-prepared to take over. For all the applause that greeted the release of its rather radical manifesto last month, it has--after meetings with its rank-and-file--meekly watered it down. It has inserted a clause, for instance, that in effect ensures Japan's cosseted farmers would be exempt from any free-trade deal with America.
Its leader, Yukio Hatoyama, who may well be the next prime minister, has managed to bungle the message on matters as delicate as Japan's long-standing military ties to the United States. Most troubling, in a recent tirade against what he called American-led ""market fundamentalism"", he not only attacked the deregulation carried out by Junichiro Koizumi, a former prime minister, earlier this decade (see story on page
), but also wanted to burden business with more rules. 
Despite the news that GDP growth resumed in the second quarter, unemployment is rising and wages are falling. So this might play well to the gallery. What politician doesn't these days profess concern about the sharp elbows of American capitalism? But Mr Hatoyama and his party have got the wrong end of the stick. It wasn't Mr Koizumi's reforms that devastated Japan's economy and caused soaring rates of poverty and inequality. Those trends, though they have worsened this year, date further back, to the ""lost decade"" of the 1990s. Lionheart's lacunae
Mr Koizumi's reforms fell short for a more subtle reason. He was right to free up employment in the export sector, giving it more scope to hire and fire; it has to compete globally. But he should have also built up the welfare state to catch those dislocated by the swings in the business cycle. And Japan's trussed-up services industry, which accounts for a much larger share of jobs than does the export sector, is in sore need of further deregulation. That would allow new businesses to start and productivity to flourish.
Elections, however, are no time for subtlety. Other aspects of the DPJ's platform, such as an assault on the power of the bureaucracy, are well worth the applause. If it can impose its will on civil servants, it might be able to break through the inertia that has prevented Japan from sorting out its pensions crisis and dealing effectively with an ageing society. That, however, depends on economic growth. And the DPJ verges dangerously close to believing that this matters less than the redistribution of wealth. Once the DPJ has kicked out the LDP, it should kick that foolish notion, too.","The Liberal Democratic Party is on the brink of electoral defeat . About time too

SASHED candidates standing on car roofs, their voices crackling through loudspeakers. Worrying signs of heatstroke affecting one of the ruling-party's septuagenarians. Women applauding politely, wearing hats and long gloves to shield their pale skin from the glinting sun.
It was August 18th, the official start of campaigning for Japan's general election on August 30th. But it might just as easily have been 1960, when Yukio Mishima, one of Japan's greatest novelists, published ""Utage No Ato"" (""After The Banquet""), an evocation of a fictional August election with loudhailers, perspiring candidates and odd goings-on in ""the bog of politics"".
As the 12-day general-election campaign got under way (the first to be held in August in 107 years), there was something quaintly old-fashioned in the absence of television hoopla. In a country otherwise mad on mass-media, a musty-smelling ban on internet campaigning also recalled a bygone era.
Even the two main candidates for prime minister, Taro Aso of the ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) and Yukio Hatoyama (pictured above), of the Democratic Party of Japan (DPJ), have hardly torn into each other. In debates, they have sounded more like two bickering old men than the scions of political dynasties (their grandfathers fought over the founding of the LDP in 1955) waging what could be one of the most important battles in any election in Japan's history.
Mr Hatoyama has tried to cast himself in the Barack Obama mould, using the English word ""change"" to sum up the DPJ's meaning to voters. After half a century of almost wall-to-wall rule by his rival's party, that should be an intoxicating message. The DPJ says evicting the ruling party will break the stranglehold on the budget held by mandarins, giving it freedom to cope with Japan's ageing population, the low birth-rate and a dangerously lopsided, export-oriented economy. But Mr Hatoyama's face hardly moves as he delivers the good tidings in a soporific murmur.
Mr Aso, meanwhile, has questioned the DPJ's ability to pay for expensive campaign promises, such as a {Yen}26,000 ($280) a month child allowance to push up the birth rate, income support to farmers and heavily subsidised schooling. The opposition party's sums are indeed fuzzy. 
But opinion polls give the DPJ a two-to-one margin over the LDP. Even old ruling-party stalwarts such as doctors and construction workers are shifting allegiances, according to a survey by Kyodo, a news agency. Behind the scenes, analysts say DPJ strategists are working tirelessly to field fresh-faced, likeable candidates to stand against LDP dinosaurs. That has meant a high number of candidates are campaigning: 330 from the DPJ and 326 from the LDP. When parliament was dissolved last month, the LDP held 300 of the 480 seats and the DPJ just 115 (there is a host of smaller parties). In the most hopeful forecasts for the DPJ, some analysts think those numbers could be reversed.
The low-key nature of the race contrasts with the previous contest in 2005, which was swept by the LDP under Junichiro Koizumi, a former prime minister. In what was known as ""Koizumi theatre"", the telegenic reformer obtained extensive television coverage by replacing LDP candidates who opposed his plans to privatise the postal system. The DPJ hardly got a look in.
Mr Koizumi is playing a big role in this election too. He is not on the ballot, after shamelessly betraying his own anti-dynastic principles by bequeathing the right to run for his seat to his son. But he still looms large--these days, as a target for both Mr Hatoyama and Mr Aso. Both men appear more intent on laying into his legacy of free-market reforms, though some predated his rule from 2001-06, than on attacking each other. They blame his removal of a ban on temporary workers in manufacturing for soaring inequality and high rates of poverty in a country that used to pride itself on being almost universally middle-class. But neither has come up with a very convincing alternative.
In an article this month, Mr Hatoyama railed against American-led ""market fundamentalism"" that, he said, the LDP had embraced since Mr Koizumi's leadership. But his alternative is a mushy-sounding concept, yuai, that mixes up the Chinese characters for friendship and love. He calls it fraternity, and says it means that activities such as agriculture--already under Fort Knox-like protection in Japan--will not be left ""at the mercy of the tides of globalism"". Mr Aso has likewise pledged to break with ""excessive market fundamentalism"".
Such views have helped shape both parties' manifestos. The DPJ's policy platform, for instance, proposes undoing one of the main Koizumi reforms by banning the use of temporary labour in manufacturing. It also wants to raise minimum-wage levels. Exporters fighting for business in China deplore both policies. Yet analysts say Mr Hatoyama, who at a recent press conference asked an aide to field questions on economics, will have little influence on--or even interest in--economic policy. Also, an upper-house election is due in 2010. This may limit the DPJ's ambitions; its priority is likely to be restructuring the civil service, where it can most easily score political points.
Not everyone thinks Mr Koizumi's reforms are widely unpopular. The image of temporary workers losing their jobs, and sometimes their home, as the economy slumped last winter was a poignant one. But the stodgy LDP old guard, which had presided over two decades of economic stagnation, bore as much of the blame as the reformist Mr Koizumi.
Jiro Yamaguchi, of Hokkaido University in northern Japan, argues that Mr Koizumi, while trying to trim the budget deficit, failed to do enough to strengthen the social-security system to shield people from the effects of deregulated wages and job losses. He thinks the DPJ, which he advises, should concentrate on developing such ""Third Way"" reforms. But the party has not yet taken up this cause. 
In one way, the DPJ has reason to be grateful to Mr Koizumi. By selling off the postal system, cutting pork-barrel spending to the construction industry and shrinking an already small state further, he may have at long last cut the financial lifeline linking the LDP to its core supporters. If so, then at least the DPJ will not have to endure a full replay of ""Utage No Ato"".

The government of Yemen rejected a ceasefire offer by rebels in the country's northern Saada region, where fighting has raged since the army launched an offensive in mid-August. The UN says at least 35,000 have recently been made homeless, on top of 150,000 displaced since fighting began against tribes allied to the Houthi clan in 2004. 
Libya's leader, Muammar Qaddafi, celebrated the 40th anniversary of the coup that brought him to power. Western leaders stayed away from the extravaganza, partly because of the furore following the hero's welcome given to Abdelbaset al-Megrahi, the Libyan intelligence agent convicted of blowing up a Pan Am aircraft over Lockerbie in 1988, killing 270 people. He returned home after an early release by Scotland, supposedly on compassionate grounds. Preparing for the big one

JAPAN is a decent, consensual and egalitarian country. Much of it is still prosperous, despite a dismal period for the economy. The beliefs of its two main political parties are often hard to tell apart. Both their leaders are grandsons of (rival) prime ministers. There were no loud celebrations when the results of the general election were announced on August 30th. It is tempting therefore to write it off as no earth-shattering event. 
That would be a mistake. The vote, in which the Democratic Party of Japan (DPJ) broke the half-century lock of the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) on power, marked the overdue destruction of Japan's post-war political system. The question is what will now take its place. System change
There are three reasons to believe that this vote marks a big change. The first is the scale of the DPJ's victory. When the LDP lost once before, in 1993, it remained easily the biggest party in the Diet, and within 11 months was back in power. Today, the LDP is devastated. It keeps just 119 out of 480 seats in the lower house of the Diet, down from 300. The DPJ has 308. 
Second, the rejection of the LDP is the culmination of deep changes in Japan's political culture. The LDP, a pro-American, pro-business consequence of the cold war, was undermined by two decades in which consumer interests and non-profit groups slowly mounted a challenge to its paternalism. Electoral reform in the mid-1990s introduced single-member districts, helping to create an opposition that could take on the LDP.
Third, by overthrowing the LDP, Japan's voters have turfed out not just a party, but a whole system. After the LDP's creation in 1955, Japan's ""iron triangle"" of party, bureaucrats and business promoted breakneck growth, and distributed its fruits equitably: cheap finance for big business, contracts for construction companies, jobs for the masses, subsidies for farmers and re-election for the LDP machine.
But corruption flourished, as tax money went to the highest bidders. Growth slowed from the 1980s, and the system was too inflexible to adjust. Voters grew more demanding. Roads, dams and temporary, low-paid jobs were no longer enough. People wanted careers. They wanted doctors, nursing homes and decent schools that would keep young families from moving to the big cities, leaving only the old behind (see
). And they wanted confidence that the government would still be solvent when they drew down their pensions--not a sure bet in a country with a national debt approaching 200% of GDP. 
Successive LDP administrations failed to respond to these demands because the government was often the weakest of the three sides of the triangle. Ministers' best intentions were undermined by bureaucrats or party barons with their own networks of power. Hence the voters' rejection of the old system in favour of something unfamiliar in Japan: an open and accountable government.
The huge task of creating it falls to Yukio Hatoyama, whom the Diet will appoint as prime minister on September 16th. It is not clear whether he, or his party, is up to the job; for alarmingly little is known--even by the voters--about the people who have taken power in the world's second-biggest economy.
In opposition the DPJ tapped into the powerful, rather Nordic, vision of their society that many Japanese people cling to and fear they are losing. Accordingly, it rejected the free-market version of change championed by Junichiro Koizumi, a reforming LDP prime minister. This left-leaning, pro-union bias explains the party's silence on liberalisation and deregulation of medical and other services that would boost productivity and help create the demand and jobs that Japan badly needs. The party has also made mild anti-American noises about military bases and the Japanese fleet. A market economy might be just about acceptable to the party, but an American market society, however defined, is not.
To Western ears, some of this sounds worrying. Yet the DPJ may be less frightening in office than in prospect. It has already begun to temper its foreign-policy rhetoric to calm American nerves. And its big economic idea, radical by Japan's standards, is broadly welcome. Where the LDP looked after producers' interests, the DPJ says it will put consumers first. It also says it will steer the economy away from export-led growth towards domestic demand. These assurances, coupled with a stronger social safety net and employment provisions (see
), may help lift some of the deflationary fog that has lain heavy over Japan for so long. Bureaucrats and the budget
But all this depends on Mr Hatoyama's first task: redesigning government. Here he starts with an advantage. Unlike the LDP, the DPJ government will not have to fight off a parallel party power structure when it makes policy. The cabinet will therefore be more powerful, and more accountable.
The test will be taking on the bureaucracy. Mr Hatoyama will have to strike a delicate balance. On the one hand the DPJ demands accountability, and promises to break bureaucrats' backs to get it. On the other, it needs to harness bureaucrats' talents if it is to formulate and carry out sound policy, particularly since so many new DPJ politicians are wet behind the ears.
How Mr Hatoyama both motivates bureaucrats and punishes them when they step out of line will make or break the DPJ. The crucial battle comes between now and December, in drawing up the budget for the 2010 fiscal year. Ministries have already submitted their spending plans, including pork for favoured groups, hoping for the usual lack of political oversight. The DPJ promises to rebuild the budget-making process from scratch, going through programmes line by line. That, too, is a chance for the new government to show that it is not as profligate as its opponents have claimed. 
Japan has had other opportunities for reform, and has failed to take them. Mr Hatoyama, with no favours to return, has a chance both to revolutionise how Japan is governed and to revitalise the economy. He will need judgment for the first, and imagination for the second. Wish him plenty of both.","The electorate has thrown out not just a party but a whole system

EARLIER this year, when Yukio Hatoyama set out to become Japan's next prime minister, he called his campaign advisers and asked them to scrap one of the party's main catchphrases on the grounds that it was too simplistic. The offending slogan was, in Japanese, seikatsu dai-ichi, or (less catchily) ""your daily life comes first"". They begged him not to drop it.
Mariko Fujiwara, of Hakuhodo, the advertising agency advising Mr Hatoyama (pictured above), says the phrase tapped into two of the main concerns gnawing on Japanese voters: their anxiety about their own living standards, and their sense that things around them which they thought ""fundamentally Japanese"" were falling apart. It was vital, she said, that Mr Hatoyama's Democratic Party of Japan (DPJ) continued to tell voters that it felt their pain. Mr Hatoyama capitulated.
Slogans are two-a-penny in politics. But that one, repeated often in the muggy heat of a gruelling August campaign, goes a long way towards explaining why Japanese voters, whose frustrations have been building up for decades, have finally demolished the crumbling dynasty that has ruled them for the past half-century.
It has taken a long time to screw up the courage. Since Japan's bubble economy burst 20 years ago, the country has suffered economic stagnation, flawed leadership, bureaucratic mismanagement, corruption scandals and stockmarket decline. Throughout it all, except for 11 short months in 1993-94, the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP), in cahoots with big business, bureaucrats and other interests, has clung to power, as it had since it was first elected in full cold-war regalia in 1955.
No longer. In a brutal verdict, the LDP lost almost two-thirds of the seats it had won in the 480-seat lower house of parliament in 2005 (see chart 1 on next page). The DPJ won by a landslide, capturing 308 seats, making it the biggest party in both the upper and lower houses (though it may still need the support of various small coalition parties). Rage against the machine
Dozens of LDP stalwarts were swept into retirement. A former prime minister and finance minister lost their jobs. Almost half of those voted in for the DPJ were first-time candidates, with an average age of less than 46. Only one-tenth of those elected for the LDP were new to the job. 
The election was an act of political protest. ""It was as though an anti-LDP fever gripped the nation,"" says Gerald Curtis, a veteran campaign watcher and professor of political science at Columbia University. The swing against the LDP was even more startling given the scepticism people felt about the untried DPJ, forged from four former parties that spanned the fiscally conservative to the socialist.
Sunday's poll was the culmination of decades of social change, in which the voters have learnt to see through the LDP's patronage and pork-barrel politics. Instead of roads and bridges to nowhere, they want doctors, nurses and economic opportunity. ""It's the end of machine politics,"" Mr Curtis says.
But something deeper may be afoot, too. By some estimates, the economic crisis this year has, in nominal terms, battered growth as much as the Great Kanto Earthquake, which destroyed much of Tokyo and neighbouring Yokohama in 1923. There are signs of what some call ""a collective identity crisis"" in Japan. Income disparity, growing numbers of impoverished pensioners and child poverty (see chart 2 on next page) clash with a view of their society that the Japanese cherish. Likewise, they look outside their borders and see their country being eclipsed by China, which is enjoying just the sort of boom Japan did from the 1950s to the 1980s. 
The great question is whether the DPJ, and society at large, have the appetite to face this insecurity and rebuild a nation that can thrive in a globalised world. Too often, the Japanese are tempted to hark back to the past, when their country was strong and its economy secure. Will the DPJ have the courage in the coming years to map out a future for Japan, or will it cling to weary nostalgia?
To witness what has gone wrong, the Japanese need go no farther than their nearest park. Early in the morning amid the mist rising off the ground, they can find slumbering bodies, heads under open umbrellas, shoes arranged neatly at the foot of a sleeping mat. These are Japan's growing army of homeless: young people thrown out of work in the recent slump and unable to pay their rent; and middle-aged men, some of whom say they cannot bear the shame of bringing their troubles home.
Hamamatsu, a coastal town south-west of Tokyo, has its share of shattered lives. Workers were laid off right down the supply chain almost as soon as home-town outfits like Yamaha and Suzuki saw export orders slump last year. The lay-offs included many Brazilians of Japanese descent, who had flown to Japan because factories needed cheap, part-time labour rather than expensive Japanese workers on full contracts. The jobless Brazilians live with each other if they cannot pay the rent, and the church provides the neediest with food parcels. At a Catholic church recently, they were making soup to share among those, like themselves, eking out the last of their savings. That included homeless Japanese men, who, unlike the Brazilians, cannot face turning to friends or family for shelter. 
That unemployed Brazilians are staffing soup kitchens for homeless Japanese is deeply shocking in Japan. It also conflicts sharply with a view of the country held by some Westerners that, despite 20 years of economic stagnation, the Japanese soldier on largely unaffected by the crisis, and have no appetite to reform their economy and society. 
Many Japanese do indeed remain proud of the country's economic achievements from the late 1950s onwards, when memories of the crushing poverty and hyperinflation of the immediate post-war years were receding, Japan, under the then youthful, tenacious LDP, embarked on an ""income-doubling plan"" that was spectacularly successful. The savings rate shot up, providing a pool of money for investment. Consumers made ""sacred regalia"" of the three essential tools of modern life: the television, washing machine and fridge. Workers made lifelong allegiances to fast-growing start-ups with names like Honda and Sony, and often lived in homes cheaply provided at the company's expense. Since then, the country has clung to the belief that society has become so universally middle-class that class itself has almost become meaningless.
Yet after the boom years of the 1980s degenerated into the lost decade of the 1990s, increasing income inequality, unemployment and social dislocation have begun to tarnish that alluring image. The slump that began late last year has sharply exacerbated the problem, pushing the unemployment rate to 5.7%--low by international standards but a record in Japan. The first to be thrown out of work, as the Brazilians in Hamamatsu attest, are those doing irregular and part-time jobs and earning up to 40% less than those on full contracts. Until the crash, their numbers had steadily climbed, from 16.4% in 1985 to 33.7% in 2007. This has swollen the ranks of an insecure economic underclass.
According to Sawako Shirahase, a sociologist at the University of Tokyo, young Japanese--and especially women--are suffering most. No recent figures capture the effect of the latest slump, but before it started, more than half the female labour force was employed as non-regular workers. Half of the elderly women who live alone have annual income below the {Yen}2m-a-year ($21,500) poverty line. Even the marriage rate has fallen--65% of women in their 20s are single. Partly, Ms Shirahase says, that is because they cannot find young men with good enough prospects to start a family.
This creates what some disparagingly call ""a winners and losers society"". Income disparity can breed a healthy sense of competition. But in a highly regulated economy such as Japan, which does not have free competition and lacks equality of opportunity, inequality can also be hard to escape. The old guard
For those at the bottom of the income scale, there had always been a last hope: the LDP. For much of its tenure, it could be counted on to provide public-works projects when employment faltered, or to underpin prices for farmers. Those politicians who could persuade the powerful national bureaucrats to dish out the pork in their electoral districts were often treated as local heroes.
But even that has worn thin. Just over a week before the election, farmers in Sekigahara, in central Japan, had every reason to thank the ruling party. They received a brand-new {Yen}6m rice harvester, with the prefecture's name printed on the side. But all of them are old men, some in their 80s, whose toil is made all the harder because their children long ago left for the brighter lights of the city. Several spoke yearningly of the DPJ's farm policies.
The ability to provide support, whether that meant a feeling of middle-class prosperity or a handout in the nick of time, kept people voting for the LDP time and again. Even so voters began to lose faith in the kind of society such policies had created, says Jeff Kingston, head of Asian studies at Temple University in Tokyo. ""A lot of stuff is coming out that tarnishes the image of the LDP and holds up a mirror to the country. People are asking 'Is this the kind of society we want?' The answer is no.""
The same may be true when the Japanese look overseas. For much of their history, they have taken comfort from shutting out the world. But that is no longer possible because of globalisation, the geopolitical importance of their neighbourhood, and the likelihood that they may need to bring in more foreign workers as their population shrinks. Japan will soon surrender its position as the world's second-largest economy to China; its large exporters are looking for salvation to Chinese demand, not American consumers.
Japan will struggle to accommodate the outside world. As borders blur, it has benefited through exports, but its own boundaries remain sacred. In the campaign the DPJ was forced to abandon its plan to start free-trade talks with America, after lobbying from farmers. ""Made in Japan"" remains a potent symbol to consumers and producers alike; one farming official in central Japan could put precise numbers on the home-grown content of a traditional Japanese breakfast, including rice and seaweed, compared with a Western one with buns and milk: 64% to 15%. But, sadly for him, the Western breakfast is rising in popularity.
The Japanese have so many reasons to resent the LDP that you might think voting it out of office would be cathartic. But on Sunday night horns did not honk and crowds did not gather. Even the DPJ disappointed television crews when it told them that it was not hosting a victory party. (If crowds had gathered they would have been rained on anyway: a passing typhoon drenched Tokyo.) The Topix share index was almost as flat as the mood around town.
That may have partly been because voters have mixed feelings about the DPJ. In opinion polls before the vote, there was as much scepticism about its policy manifesto as there was about the LDP's. But lethargy also infects politics in general. Ask economists, sociologists or businessmen what the government should reform and you are often met with a baleful shrug. Ichiro Shiraki, a successful businessman who employs scores of elderly women in central Japan to wrap seaweed around his company's rice crackers, can see the consequences of ageing all around him. But ask him what the government should do to help and he appears flummoxed. ""That's the politicians' job, not mine,"" he says. Who's the boss
Such diffidence dates back a long time. As Ms Fujiwara, the advertising executive, puts it, until recently the Japanese held industry, not government, responsible for looking after people; firms provided job security, income and benefits; the government's task was to make sure they stayed in business. ""People knew instinctively that as long as the economy took care of them, ideology was something they didn't need to debate,"" she says.
This has created citizens who vote, but who have little interest in what politicians actually do with power. Masaru Tamamoto, a social commentator, laments the lack of ideological debate among the voting public, and among political parties, too. It is hard to change. He notes that Japan has never had a people's revolution; big changes in history, such as the Meiji restoration of 1868, were top-down affairs led by disgruntled members of the samurai elite. When hard-left protest groups emerged in the 1960s, they were quickly suppressed because of Japan's cold-war relations with the West. The country has also long been immensely proud of its bureaucrats--they, too, date back to the samurai who sheathed their swords and became pen pushers from the 1600s onwards. Until recent scandals over their handling of the pensions system, people tended to defer to them to steer the country correctly.
Such a disengaged voting public carries risks for Japan's future. Mr Curtis, of Columbia University, notes that neither the DPJ nor the LDP enjoys a core group of supporters. That helps explain why voters are so fickle. ""If all Japanese politics becomes is a swing from one party to another, you have a situation in which Japan will be in irreversible decline,"" he says.
So will the DPJ be able to excite voters enough to convince them of the need for change? On the campaign trail, the party looked narrow in its ambitions, preferring chequebook politics to radical policies. It promised child subsidies, free secondary schools and guaranteed minimum pensions--though often without explaining clearly how it would pay for them. Mr Curtis, however, says he expects actual handouts in the first year to be a lot less than the headline figures promised. He thinks the DPJ's leaders are fiscally more hawkish than the manifesto suggested. 
Perhaps the DPJ will be bolder with a second area of policy. The party wants to break the bureaucrats' control over the nation's purse strings by creating a strategy bureau, close to the prime minister's office, to draw up the budget. The bureaucracy is, indeed, in need of reform. Its departments often operate in bunker-like isolation. Problems that range across ministries are therefore rarely solved. The worry is that Mr Hatoyama's government lacks administrative experience; it has only a handful of people who have previously held cabinet office. It cannot afford to alienate its ministries too quickly, not least because it needs their help to implement policy and to pull Japan out of its slump.
Thirdly, the party has pledged over the longer term to reduce the economy's reliance on export industries, which were closely affiliated with the LDP, by spurring domestic demand. This is a worthy goal that the LDP repeatedly failed to achieve. ""The whole emphasis on tax policy has been to offer breaks to companies on investment, while the household sector has had mild tax hikes,"" says Peter Tasker of Arcus Research, a Tokyo-based consultancy. The DPJ has not fully spelt out how it plans to make the shift, however (see
).
Japan's recent experience of bold economic reform ended badly. One of the most lambasted figures in the election was Junichiro Koizumi, the lion-haired, pro-American who led Japan from 2001 to 2006. He won a landslide victory for the LDP in 2005 promising to privatise the postal service, and made some headway in freeing up the labour market. But the crisis has damaged his legacy. He had told voters that without pain there would be no gain. The way the DPJ portrayed his tenure on the campaign trail, there was plenty of pain but no gain. Out of the wreckage
However, Mr Koizumi's legacy has not stopped reform-minded politicians in the regions. One of those, until he recently stepped down, was Hiroshi Nakada, mayor of Yokohama, the city adjoining Tokyo, who cut a dashing figure sitting in the foyer of the mayor's office, offering full disclosure of government accounts to his constituents. His approval ratings remained high to the end, even though he cut the city budget. But he, too, worries about his countrymen: ""People are confused. Japan has lost a sense of identity.""
It is easy to dismiss Japan after so many disappointments--to forget that it still has high savings, low crime, high-tech industries and creative flair. The wonder of Japan is that it sometimes meanders for years, decades, even centuries, and then erupts into a burst of creativity and reinvention. This may be one such moment, when the toppling of a political monolith unleashes hidden depths of civic action. But that will happen only if the DPJ grows bold enough to lead the way.

By some estimates , the economic crisis this year has , in nominal terms , battered growth as much as the Great Kanto Earthquake , which destroyed much of Tokyo and neighbouring Yokohama in 1923 . There are signs of what some call "" a collective identity crisis "" in Japan . Income disparity , growing numbers of impoverished pensioners and child poverty ( see chart 2 on next page ) clash with a view of their society that the Japanese cherish . Likewise , they look outside their borders and see their country being eclipsed by China , which is enjoying just the sort of boom Japan did from the 1950s to the 1980s . 
 The great question is whether the DPJ , and society at large , have the appetite to face this insecurity and rebuild a nation that can thrive in a globalised world . Too often , the Japanese are tempted to hark back to the past , when their country was strong and its economy secure . Will the DPJ have the courage in the coming years to map out a future for Japan , or will it cling to weary nostalgia ? 
 To witness what has gone wrong , the Japanese need go no farther than their nearest park . Early in the morning amid the mist rising off the ground , they can find slumbering bodies , heads under open umbrellas , shoes arranged neatly at the foot of a sleeping mat . These are Japan 's growing army of homeless : young people thrown out of work in the recent slump and unable to pay their rent ; and middle - aged men , some of whom say they can not bear the shame of bringing their troubles home . 
 Hamamatsu , a coastal town south - west of Tokyo , has its share of shattered lives . Workers were laid off right down the supply chain almost as soon as home - town outfits like Yamaha and Suzuki saw export orders slump last year . The lay - offs included many Brazilians of Japanese descent , who had flown to Japan because factories needed cheap , part - time labour rather than expensive Japanese workers on full contracts . The jobless Brazilians live with each other if they can not pay the rent , and the church provides the neediest with food parcels . At a Catholic church recently , they were making soup to share among those , like themselves , eking out the last of their savings . That included homeless Japanese men , who , unlike the Brazilians , can not face turning to friends or family for shelter . 
 That unemployed Brazilians are staffing soup kitchens for homeless Japanese is deeply shocking in Japan . It also conflicts sharply with a view of the country held by some Westerners that , despite 20 years of economic stagnation , the Japanese soldier on largely unaffected by the crisis , and have no appetite to reform their economy and society . 
 Many Japanese do indeed remain proud of the country 's economic achievements from the late 1950s onwards , when memories of the crushing poverty and hyperinflation of the immediate post - war years were receding , Japan , under the then youthful , tenacious LDP , embarked on an "" income - doubling plan "" that was spectacularly successful . The savings rate shot up , providing a pool of money for investment . Consumers made "" sacred regalia "" of the three essential tools of modern life : the television , washing machine and fridge . Workers made lifelong allegiances to fast - growing start - ups with names like Honda and Sony , and often lived in homes cheaply provided at the company 's expense . Since then , the country has clung to the belief that society has become so universally middle - class that class itself has almost become meaningless . 
 Yet after the boom years of the 1980s degenerated into the lost decade of the 1990s , increasing income inequality , unemployment and social dislocation have begun to tarnish that alluring image . The slump that began late last year has sharply exacerbated the problem , pushing the unemployment rate to 5.7%--low by international standards but a record in Japan . The first to be thrown out of work , as the Brazilians in Hamamatsu attest , are those doing irregular and part - time jobs and earning up to 40 % less than those on full contracts . Until the crash , their numbers had steadily climbed , from 16.4 % in 1985 to 33.7 % in 2007 . This has swollen the ranks of an insecure economic underclass . 
 According to Sawako Shirahase , a sociologist at the University of Tokyo , young Japanese -- and especially women -- are suffering most . No recent figures capture the effect of the latest slump , but before it started , more than half the female labour force was employed as non - regular workers . Half of the elderly women who live alone have annual income below the { Yen}2m - a - year ( $ 21,500 ) poverty line . Even the marriage rate has fallen--65 % of women in their 20s are single . Partly , Ms Shirahase says , that is because they can not find young men with good enough prospects to start a family . 
 This creates what some disparagingly call "" a winners and losers society "" . Income disparity can breed a healthy sense of competition . But in a highly regulated economy such as Japan , which does not have free competition and lacks equality of opportunity , inequality can also be hard to escape . The old guard 
 For those at the bottom of the income scale , there had always been a last hope : the LDP . For much of its tenure , it could be counted on to provide public - works projects when employment faltered , or to underpin prices for farmers . Those politicians who could persuade the powerful national bureaucrats to dish out the pork in their electoral districts were often treated as local heroes . 
 But even that has worn thin . Just over a week before the election , farmers in Sekigahara , in central Japan , had every reason to thank the ruling party . They received a brand - new { Yen}6 m rice harvester , with the prefecture 's name printed on the side . But all of them are old men , some in their 80s , whose toil is made all the harder because their children long ago left for the brighter lights of the city . Several spoke yearningly of the DPJ 's farm policies . 
 The ability to provide support , whether that meant a feeling of middle - class prosperity or a handout in the nick of time , kept people voting for the LDP time and again . Even so voters began to lose faith in the kind of society such policies had created , says Jeff Kingston , head of Asian studies at Temple University in Tokyo . "" A lot of stuff is coming out that tarnishes the image of the LDP and holds up a mirror to the country . People are asking ' Is this the kind of society we want ? ' The answer is no . "" 
 The same may be true when the Japanese look overseas . For much of their history , they have taken comfort from shutting out the world . But that is no longer possible because of globalisation , the geopolitical importance of their neighbourhood , and the likelihood that they may need to bring in more foreign workers as their population shrinks . Japan will soon surrender its position as the world 's second - largest economy to China ; its large exporters are looking for salvation to Chinese demand , not American consumers . 
 Japan will struggle to accommodate the outside world . As borders blur , it has benefited through exports , but its own boundaries remain sacred . In the campaign the DPJ was forced to abandon its plan to start free - trade talks with America , after lobbying from farmers . "" Made in Japan "" remains a potent symbol to consumers and producers alike ; one farming official in central Japan could put precise numbers on the home - grown content of a traditional Japanese breakfast , including rice and seaweed , compared with a Western one with buns and milk : 64 % to 15 % . But , sadly for him , the Western breakfast is rising in popularity . 
 The Japanese have so many reasons to resent the LDP that you might think voting it out of office would be cathartic . But on Sunday night horns did not honk and crowds did not gather . Even the DPJ disappointed television crews when it told them that it was not hosting a victory party . ( If crowds had gathered they would have been rained on anyway : a passing typhoon drenched Tokyo . ) The Topix share index was almost as flat as the mood around town . 
 That may have partly been because voters have mixed feelings about the DPJ . In opinion polls before the vote , there was as much scepticism about its policy manifesto as there was about the LDP 's . But lethargy also infects politics in general . Ask economists , sociologists or businessmen what the government should reform and you are often met with a baleful shrug . Ichiro Shiraki , a successful businessman who employs scores of elderly women in central Japan to wrap seaweed around his company 's rice crackers , can see the consequences of ageing all around him . But ask him what the government should do to help and he appears flummoxed . "" That 's the politicians ' job , not mine , "" he says . Who 's the boss 
 Such diffidence dates back a long time . As Ms Fujiwara , the advertising executive , puts it , until recently the Japanese held industry , not government , responsible for looking after people ; firms provided job security , income and benefits ; the government 's task was to make sure they stayed in business . "" People knew instinctively that as long as the economy took care of them , ideology was something they did n't need to debate , "" she says . 
 This has created citizens who vote , but who have little interest in what politicians actually do with power . Masaru Tamamoto , a social commentator , laments the lack of ideological debate among the voting public , and among political parties , too . It is hard to change . He notes that Japan has never had a people 's revolution ; big changes in history , such as the Meiji restoration of 1868 , were top - down affairs led by disgruntled members of the samurai elite . When hard - left protest groups emerged in the 1960s , they were quickly suppressed because of Japan 's cold - war relations with the West . The country has also long been immensely proud of its bureaucrats -- they , too , date back to the samurai who sheathed their swords and became pen pushers from the 1600s onwards . Until recent scandals over their handling of the pensions system , people tended to defer to them to steer the country correctly . 
 Such a disengaged voting public carries risks for Japan 's future . Mr Curtis , of Columbia University , notes that neither the DPJ nor the LDP enjoys a core group of supporters . That helps explain why voters are so fickle . "" If all Japanese politics becomes is a swing from one party to another , you have a situation in which Japan will be in irreversible decline , "" he says . 
 So will the DPJ be able to excite voters enough to convince them of the need for change ? On the campaign trail , the party looked narrow in its ambitions , preferring chequebook politics to radical policies . It promised child subsidies , free secondary schools and guaranteed minimum pensions -- though often without explaining clearly how it would pay for them . Mr Curtis , however , says he expects actual handouts in the first year to be a lot less than the headline figures promised . He thinks the DPJ 's leaders are fiscally more hawkish than the manifesto suggested . 
 Perhaps the DPJ will be bolder with a second area of policy . The party wants to break the bureaucrats ' control over the nation 's purse strings by creating a strategy bureau , close to the prime minister 's office , to draw up the budget . The bureaucracy is , indeed , in need of reform . Its departments often operate in bunker - like isolation . Problems that range across ministries are therefore rarely solved . The worry is that Yukio Hatoyama's government lacks administrative experience ; it has only a handful of people who have previously held cabinet office . It can not afford to alienate its ministries too quickly , not least because it needs their help to implement policy and to pull Japan out of its slump . 
 Thirdly , the party has pledged over the longer term to reduce the economy 's reliance on export industries , which were closely affiliated with the LDP , by spurring domestic demand . This is a worthy goal that the LDP repeatedly failed to achieve . "" The whole emphasis on tax policy has been to offer breaks to companies on investment , while the household sector has had mild tax hikes , "" says Peter Tasker of Arcus Research , a Tokyo - based consultancy . The DPJ has not fully spelt out how it plans to make the shift , however ( see 
 ) . 
 Japan 's recent experience of bold economic reform ended badly . One of the most lambasted figures in the election was Junichiro Koizumi , the lion - haired , pro - American who led Japan from 2001 to 2006 . He won a landslide victory for the LDP in 2005 promising to privatise the postal service , and made some headway in freeing up the labour market . But the crisis has damaged his legacy . He had told voters that without pain there would be no gain . The way the DPJ portrayed his tenure on the campaign trail , there was plenty of pain but no gain . Out of the wreckage 
 However , Mr Koizumi 's legacy has not stopped reform - minded politicians in the regions . One of those , until he recently stepped down , was Hiroshi Nakada , mayor of Yokohama , the city adjoining Tokyo , who cut a dashing figure sitting in the foyer of the mayor 's office , offering full disclosure of government accounts to his constituents . His approval ratings remained high to the end , even though he cut the city budget . But he , too , worries about his countrymen : "" People are confused . Japan has lost a sense of identity . "" 
 It is easy to dismiss Japan after so many disappointments -- to forget that it still has high savings , low crime , high - tech industries and creative flair . The wonder of Japan is that it sometimes meanders for years , decades , even centuries , and then erupts into a burst of creativity and reinvention . This may be one such moment , when the toppling of a political monolith unleashes hidden depths of civic action . But that will happen only if the DPJ grows bold enough to lead the way .

AMONG Japan's many inventions in the 20th century was the ""developmental state"", an alliance between government and business to direct industry and set economic priorities. For most of the post-war period it was phenomenally successful, transforming the country into the world's second largest economy. So was the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP), which embraced this approach during over 50 years of almost uninterrupted sway. But in elections on August 30th the Democratic Party of Japan (DPJ) trounced the LDP. Given the active role that the state still plays in the economy, the change may be as sweeping for business as it is for politics.
The relations that big business nurtured with the LDP for decades now count for little. The 1,400 firms of Keidanren, a powerful business lobby, for example, donated around $30m to the LDP in 2007 compared with less than $1m to the DPJ (though Keidanren itself declined to endorse a party in the election).
The DPJ is eclectic, comprised of former LDP politicians, ex-bureaucrats, socialists, right-wingers and reformers. Although its leadership includes the scions of rich industrial families, unions constitute its political base. Yukio Hatoyama, who is poised to be named prime minister, has railed against ""unrestrained market fundamentalism and financial capitalism"".
The party campaigned against the economic reforms of Junichiro Koizumi, who as prime minister in 2001-06 revitalised Japanese business but is today blamed for a growing sense of economic insecurity. On the whole the party, like Japan itself, is conservative and averse to change. Yet it has pledged to overhaul economic policy in three areas that will have a big impact on the private sector: government spending, social safety nets and Japan's reliance on exports. These changes, it is hoped, will restore growth to the economy, which has stagnated since a stockmarket and property bubble burst in the early 1990s. 
Start with spending. The new government plans to curtail big government construction projects, a hallmark of the LDP. Some of the money saved will go to subsidies for green technologies, such as a proposal to pay half the cost of installing solar-power systems in homes. The DPJ wants Japan to reduce its carbon emissions by 25% below 1990 levels by 2020 (the LDP had called for a 15% cut; Keidanren wants 4%). As a result heavy industry, and construction and cement firms in particular, are bracing for tough times, while green-tech firms like Sharp, Sanyo and Toshiba are preparing for a boom.
The DPJ wants to boost consumer spending by reducing taxes and fees. It plans to halve the petrol tax of {Yen}54 ($0.58) a litre and gradually eliminate highway tolls, for example, in blatant contradiction of its green goals. This should boost carmakers and related firms, to the detriment of Japan's famed railways.
The DPJ is also determined to increase social spending. It says it will improve health care, expand payments for the unemployed and provide a minimum monthly pension of {Yen}70,000. To support families, it says it will give parents {Yen}26,000 a month for every child aged 15 and under, and remove the tuition fees for public high schools of around {Yen}120,000 a year.
These measures are all designed to give people more financial security, in the hope that this will induce them to spend more and thus boost the economy. If they succeed, firms that cater to domestic consumers, from clothing retailers to restaurants, are expected to prosper. 
Some measures aim to boost business directly. The DPJ wants to reduce the tax rate for small firms from 18% to 11% (even though only one-third of them actually pay tax). But other policies are likely to hurt. It wants to increase the minimum wage to {Yen}1,000 per hour eventually from as little as {Yen}629 today. It also wants to reverse one of Mr Koizumi's reforms, allowing manufacturing firms to hire temporary employees, which it says adds to the sense of economic vulnerability, but which businesses say injects some flexibility into otherwise hopelessly rigid labour laws.
Businesses are worried, too, that the new government might tax them to pay for all this, given that the public debt is already nearly 200% of GDP. The DPJ says it will find the money by eliminating waste, but Keidanren, at least, thinks that will not be enough. It wants the government to raise the consumption tax from 5% to 10%--something the DPJ has pledged not to do for four years.
The traditional bias towards exporters is also in question. Carmakers and electronics firms in particular benefit from a weak yen, which keeps prices low for overseas customers. But it also hurts domestic producers and consumers. Financial types expect the yen to appreciate under the DPJ.
Of course, the DPJ may struggle to implement all of these plans, given its own ideological fissures and the entrenched power of Japan's bureaucracy. And it has no intention of undoing the protectionist red tape, particularly in services, that does the most to hold back Japan's economy. Yet the new government may nonetheless be paving the way for future reforms. Past Japanese governments were reluctant to embrace deregulation and the economic upheaval it would bring, in part because big companies provided all-important social safeguards (lifetime employment, generous pensions and the like). The DPJ, however, intends to create a state-funded safety net. That would remove one of the biggest obstacles to change.
This year the Japanese economy is forecast to contract by 3-6%. China will surpass it as the world's second-largest economy this year or next. That is expected to cause widespread hand-wringing, akin to America's ""Sputnik moment,"" when the Soviet Union beat it to become the first country to launch a satellite. The DPJ has no grand strategy for restoring Japan to growth--and greatness--beyond funnelling money to consumers, and leaving them to do the hard work. That may be wise. Only developing countries need a developmental state, after all.","The effect on business of the change of government in Japan is likely to be subtle but profound

BEFORE the momentous victory of the Democratic Party of Japan (DPJ) on August 30th, the prize for the living politician with the profoundest impact on Japan's politics might still have gone to Junichiro Koizumi, dazzling prime minister from 2001 to 2006. After it, many abroad might award the prize to Yukio Hatoyama, who will become prime minister on September 16th. In fact, the case for Ichiro Ozawa, the organisational force behind the DPJ's landslide, is nearly bombproof.
Abroad and at home, Mr Koizumi is more familiar than both. His sleight-of-hand was to appear to be running against his own Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) when he was running for it. Yet Mr Koizumi paid mostly only lip-service to the idea of smashing the post-war system in which LDP factions had monopolised--and more recently paralysed--political decisions. With hindsight, he merely postponed the devastation that Mr Ozawa has just unleashed by selecting and grooming fresh candidates to unseat the LDP dinosaurs. Now LDP extinction looms.
For nearly 20 years Mr Ozawa, with black bags under half-closed eyes that give him the look of a dissolute eagle, has sought that devastation. In 1993 ""the Destroyer"" triggered the LDP's first-ever fall from power, by storming out with his followers. Eleven months later, the LDP was back. This time the damage will be longer-lasting. With the end of the cold war, Mr Ozawa recognised that the ""LDP system"", founded in 1955, had outlived its purpose. Political competition, he never stopped arguing, should be organised around the policy choices of two main parties, not around personality and pork. In this goal Mr Ozawa is the constant man of Japanese politics. Yet there are other constants to the 67-year-old's four-decade-long political career. They include a Machiavellian penchant for the shadows; a fondness for flashes of personal power; a cruel delight in seeing others submit; extreme and sudden risk-taking; and no compunction to explain or confer.
In the LDP Mr Ozawa was bag-carrier to Kakuei Tanaka, the most powerful--and corrupt--post-war politician. Even after he resigned as prime minister, Tanaka was head of the LDP's largest faction and was the country's yami shogun (shadow shogun). From him, Mr Ozawa learnt how to wield power from out of sight. Mr Ozawa was kingmaker, as both faction leader and LDP secretary-general, but never prime minister. Rivals hated him.
But if the Destroyer brought the LDP government down in 1993, he also unwittingly brought down its replacement, in whose creation he had played the central hand. Indeed, his machinations drove the Socialists, the establishment's sworn enemy, into the LDP's arms--no mean feat. And in 2007 he shocked his colleagues again, by discussing a coalition with the LDP. DPJ executives, led by Mr Hatoyama, were appalled. His colleagues, he later said, failed to see he meant to bring the LDP down from within.
All this has a bearing on the DPJ today. Mr Ozawa had been party leader until May, when allegations of fund-raising irregularities in his own office forced his resignation. Now his successor, Mr Hatoyama, has made Mr Ozawa the DPJ's secretary-general, a powerful party post but outside the government. His brief, says Mr Hatoyama, is to oversee the 2010 election for the upper house of the Diet (parliament). Others want Mr Ozawa to act as mentor to the DPJ's huge cohort of wide-eyed freshmen.
If Mr Ozawa focuses on these jobs, then Mr Hatoyama can get on with his. More than anything, Japan voted on August 30th for clearer, more accountable government. Under the LDP, party politicians often subverted the government's agenda. Bureaucrats wielded disproportionate power. Mr Hatoyama promises to vest authority in the cabinet--Westminster is cited as the model. 
But Mr Hatoyama, scathingly described by a former prime minister, Yasuhiro Nakasone, as ""soft-serve ice-cream"", has yet to show his mettle. Though the grandson of the LDP's first prime minister, he comes across as too decent for politics--one reason he needs Mr Ozawa as a guardian. Mr Ozawa now controls the party's purse strings. The DPJ's landslide gives him huge prestige. Many new MPs owe their seat to him. In effect, says Takao Toshikawa, editor of Tokyo Insideline, a newsletter, Mr Ozawa controls 140-odd ""Ozawa kids""--about as large a faction as Tanaka ever boasted. Should the Destroyer revert to type he could undermine the government with devastating informal power. The real revolution: a different Japan
Perhaps, though, Mr Ozawa's power is all about perception. The glare of sunlight on the political process, as Mr Hatoyama will attempt with cabinet-led government, might wither Mr Ozawa's dark powers. And not all of the DPJ's new recruits will feel beholden to him: the DPJ shuns formal factions.
But it is still helpful to think of Mr Ozawa as a revolutionary, putting ends above ruthless means. Destroying the LDP may merely have been a means towards his abiding end: to see Japan become a more ""normal"" country, ie, more in control of its destiny. For nearly 20 years Mr Ozawa has argued that Japan's foreign policy has been shaped by the subservience to the United States that followed defeat, and by a wish to do everything, especially defence, on the cheap. In future, he says, Japan should pursue its own path when its interests diverge from America's, refusing help to America's global military adventures, and joining only those missions led by the United Nations. Mostly, he says, it should concentrate on its standing in its Asian backyard. 
These views, shared by Mr Hatoyama, are not anti-American. But they challenge plenty of assumptions. One is that Mr Ozawa will now mellow and fade. Another is that the new government will allow domestic concerns, however pressing, to crowd out a foreign agenda. Americans expecting their security alliance to cruise along as normal should take note. author

They include a Machiavellian penchant for the shadows ; a fondness for flashes of personal power ; a cruel delight in seeing others submit ; extreme and sudden risk - taking ; and no compunction to explain or confer . 
 In the LDP Mr Ozawa was bag - carrier to Kakuei Tanaka , the most powerful -- and corrupt -- post - war politician . Even after he resigned as prime minister , Tanaka was head of the LDP 's largest faction and was the country 's yami shogun ( shadow shogun ) . From him , Mr Ozawa learnt how to wield power from out of sight . Mr Ozawa was kingmaker , as both faction leader and LDP secretary - general , but never prime minister . Rivals hated him . 
 But if the Destroyer brought the LDP government down in 1993 , he also unwittingly brought down its replacement , in whose creation he had played the central hand . Indeed , his machinations drove the Socialists , the establishment 's sworn enemy , into the LDP 's arms -- no mean feat . And in 2007 he shocked his colleagues again , by discussing a coalition with the LDP . DPJ executives , led by Yukio Hatoyama , were appalled . His colleagues , he later said , failed to see he meant to bring the LDP down from within . 
 All this has a bearing on the DPJ today . Mr Ozawa had been party leader until May , when allegations of fund - raising irregularities in his own office forced his resignation . Now Yukio Hatoyama's has made Mr Ozawa the DPJ 's secretary - general , a powerful party post but outside the government . Yukio Hatoyama's brief , says Yukio Hatoyama , is to oversee the 2010 election for the upper house of the Diet ( parliament ) . Others want Mr Ozawa to act as mentor to the DPJ 's huge cohort of wide - eyed freshmen . 
 If Mr Ozawa focuses on these jobs , then Yukio Hatoyama can get on with Yukio Hatoyama's . More than anything , Japan voted on August 30th for clearer , more accountable government . Under the LDP , party politicians often subverted the government 's agenda . Bureaucrats wielded disproportionate power . Yukio Hatoyama promises to vest authority in the cabinet -- Westminster is cited as the model . 
 But Yukio Hatoyama has yet to show Yukio Hatoyama's mettle . Though the grandson of the LDP 's first prime minister , Yukio Hatoyama comes across as too decent for politics -- one reason Yukio Hatoyama needs Mr Ozawa as a guardian . Mr Ozawa now controls the party 's purse strings . The DPJ 's landslide gives him huge prestige . Many new MPs owe their seat to him . In effect , says Takao Toshikawa , editor of Tokyo Insideline , a newsletter , Mr Ozawa controls 140 - odd "" Ozawa kids""--about as large a faction as Tanaka ever boasted . Should the Destroyer revert to type he could undermine the government with devastating informal power . The real revolution : a different Japan 
 Perhaps , though , Mr Ozawa 's power is all about perception . The glare of sunlight on the political process , as Yukio Hatoyama will attempt with cabinet - led government , might wither Mr Ozawa 's dark powers . And not all of the DPJ 's new recruits will feel beholden to him : the DPJ shuns formal factions . 
 But it is still helpful to think of Mr Ozawa as a revolutionary , putting ends above ruthless means . Destroying the LDP may merely have been a means towards his abiding end : to see Japan become a more "" normal "" country , ie , more in control of its destiny . For nearly 20 years Mr Ozawa has argued that Japan 's foreign policy has been shaped by the subservience to the United States that followed defeat , and by a wish to do everything , especially defence , on the cheap . In future , he says , Japan should pursue its own path when its interests diverge from America 's , refusing help to America 's global military adventures , and joining only those missions led by the United Nations . Mostly , he says , it should concentrate on its standing in its Asian backyard . 
 These views , shared by Yukio Hatoyama , are not anti - American . But they challenge plenty of assumptions . One is that Mr Ozawa will now mellow and fade . Another is that the new government will allow domestic concerns , however pressing , to crowd out a foreign agenda . Americans expecting their security alliance to cruise along as normal should take note . author

THE world's leaders will have a chance at the United Nations General Assembly from September 23rd to size up Japan's new leader, Yukio Hatoyama. They will find a man flushed with having staged the most important transfer of power in Japan in more than 50 years. But what the change means for the rest of the world may well remain a tantalising mystery.
It would be odd, even disappointing, if decades of one-party rule ended without shaking up Japan's foreign policy. Its bedrock has been Japan's close alliance with America. As conqueror, the United States first demilitarised Japan, then turned it into its main Asian ally in the cold war, and then, under President Bush, encouraged it to join the ""war on terror"". 
Throughout, American troops have been stationed in Japan, occupying 134 bases on land that is, in total, more than one-and-a-half times the size of Tokyo. For some Japanese this ""footprint"" is grimly reminiscent of occupation. Yet, in a region facing a growing nuclear threat from North Korea and China's inchoate deepwater fleet, American security has allowed Japan to keep defence spending around a modest 1% of GDP (it has shrunk recently). America's is four times that, and China's has soared in the past decade. 
The importance of the relationship with America has spawned puzzlement and even suspicion about how Mr Hatoyama's Democratic Party of Japan (DPJ) will conduct foreign policy. In opposition, it voted against many of the security agreements with the Bush administration. It bitterly contested the Iraq war. And it has opposed the decision to spend $6 billion on relocating 8,000 marines from a base on the Japanese island of Okinawa to Guam.
Since the election, its coalition with two small parties to give it a big parliamentary majority has threatened further to strain the alliance. One of those parties consists of former socialists who have staunchly opposed keeping American troops on Japanese soil. Only after lengthy bargaining did it agree to water down its anti-American stance. For America, already frustrated with an ally whose soldiers are not allowed to shoot, all this seems alarming.
Mr Hatoyama's own muddled messages have added to the concerns. He has berated American-led ""market fundamentalism"", yet then called security arrangements with America the ""cornerstone"" of Japanese diplomatic policy. Like many Japanese, he supports global nuclear disarmament. He has pledged to investigate a supposedly secret deal allowing American nuclear-armed vessels to use Japanese ports. Yet he also wants a firm line taken against rogue North Korea.
His main foreign-policy goal is to establish a more ""equal"" partnership with America. This, however, puts him in the predicament of a rebellious youth desperate to break out of its parents' clutches--but unable to afford it. He has expensive campaign promises to meet, such as expanding social welfare and child support, and little scope to spend more on rearming.
The man appointed this week as foreign minister to make diplomatic harmony out of this cacophony is Katsuya Okada. He is a forward-thinking pragmatist but has little experience in government. He has expressed no desire to rock the boat with the Obama administration, which the DPJ greatly prefers to the Bush one. But he believes Japan should not automatically extend its refuelling mission in the Indian Ocean for forces fighting in Afghanistan when the agreement expires in January.
For the time being Mr Hatoyama is unlikely to provide much clarity on how he feels about the American relationship, even when he meets informally with Barack Obama at the United Nations in New York. He would far prefer to dwell on issues such as climate change, where he has already delighted environmentalists with a promise--albeit with strings attached--to cut greenhouse-gas emissions by 25% from 1990 levels by 2020.
Any changes may be more symbolic than structural. ""Under the cover that Obama is not Bush, the DPJ could express a greater desire to work with the Obama administration and essentially declare a 'more equal partnership' with little substantial adjustment or cost,"" argue three scholars in a forthcoming article* in Asia Policy, an American journal.
It would be a missed opportunity, however, if Mr Hatoyama did not start to cultivate some sense that a change in ruling party means something to people outside Japan. He has appointed as finance minister a veteran fiscal hawk, 77-year-old Hirohisa Fujii, whose comments on the yen caused it to soar on September 17th. Japan's partners at the G20 summit in Pittsburgh will want to know how he plans to steer Japan's economy back to growth. 
Mr Hatoyama has made a strong commitment to improve relations with other Asian countries, and has a chance of easing decades-old tensions because of his party's history of sincere apology for Japan's wartime atrocities. 
Rapprochement with the neighbours, however, need not come at the cost of worsening ties with America. Throughout its history Japan, when it has not closed its doors to foreigners altogether, has tended to seek out and support the dominant or rising powers of the day, be that middle-kingdom China, Nazi Germany or post-war America. China's emergence thus presents its diplomats with something of a novelty: the task of balancing relations between two powers at once. Previous Japanese governments have struggled to define a post-cold-war foreign policy. For all the anxieties change brings, Mr Hatoyama's may be better-placed to try.

EVERY night the Yomiuri Shimbun building in Tokyo begins to shake. From The Economist's office on the eighth floor it feels, for a moment, like an earthquake. But it is just the world's biggest-selling newspaper cranking up the printing presses in the bowels of the building for tomorrow morning's edition. A different sort of tremor has rattled the Yomiuri in the past week. The government of Yukio Hatoyama came into office on September 16th, vowing that it wanted to shake up some of the power structures in Japan that had helped its defeated rival, the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP), hold sway for half a century. 
The main target is the bureaucracy, which has wielded extraordinary power from its bunker-like compound in Tokyo. But one of the bureaucracy's levers of control has been the press, which critics say has too often enjoyed a relationship of mutual back-scratching with the mandarins. 
So when Mr Hatoyama took office, threatening to ban regular press conferences by bureaucrats in a bid to lessen their sway, the battle lines were drawn. It took just a day for the Yomiuri to hit back. In an editorial, it acknowledged that Mr Hatoyama had a right to wrestle power back from civil servants--but not, it said, at the cost of the media's access to information. ""We want the Hatoyama administration to reconsider its decision to muzzle bureaucrats,"" the newspaper said.
The skirmish may appear small, but it has important ramifications. As Takashi Uesugi, a campaigning freelance journalist puts it, Japan's equivalent of America's military-industrial complex is the ""bureaucracy-media complex"". But taking on both the bureaucracy and the media at the same time could expose the new government to a war on two fronts. 
The power of the bureaucracy dates back centuries, when it comprised members of the samurai elite who were encouraged to administer, rather than fight. In the past 50 years, bureaucrats helped develop the industrial policies that turned Japan from post-war collapse to the second-biggest economy in the world. 
The mandarins' reputation has faded during the economic hardship of the past 20 years. But Takashi Inoguchi, a political scientist, believes the samurai strain has persisted. He likens the bureaucracy to a Roman legion that will protect itself in tortoise-like formation. ""Its spirit and mental framework remains that of the warrior,"" he says. ""It is very determined, very patient and organisationally very strong.""
The media, meanwhile, give the civil servants an unusually direct line of communication with the outside world. Newspapers have a circulation of 68m copies a day, the highest in the rich world, and in each ministry they are part of a system known as the ""kisha club"", or press club, which dates back to the 19th century and encourages intimate contact between the mainstream media and the bureaucracy.
In the past the clubs, whose members are self-selecting, have been criticised for closing ministerial press conferences to foreign correspondents, internet reporters and freelancers (whom they often disparage as ""gossip-mongers""). The system breeds information-sharing and discourages scoops. Critics say it stifles the sort of investigative reporting badly needed after Japan's incestuous politics under the LDP. 
Even some leading lights of the mass media acknowledge that change may be overdue. Yoichi Funabashi, editor-in-chief of the Asahi Shimbun, and one of Japan's most respected journalists, welcomed Mr Hatoyama's unprecedented decision to allow a handful of magazine and internet journalists to his inaugural news conference: ""Now the dam has broken."" 
Less understanding members of the media, however, may turn against Mr Hatoyama. Papers such as the Yomiuri, with a circulation of 10m, have longstanding ties to the LDP; its boss, Tsuneo Watanabe, was considered one of the party's kingmakers. The press also has its eye on a scandal in which Mr Hatoyama admitted that his fund-raising organisation listed fictitious individual donations, including from dead people. This may return to trouble him.
Yet he would surely be foolish to leave the kisha club alone. His party won the election in August by a landslide partly because it promised more open government. The Japanese are keen to see an end to the murky back-room compromises in which elected officials took office, but bureaucrats were in power. If the press remains complicit with that system, Mr Hatoyama's promise to end the status quo in Japan will be all the harder to achieve.","A change of government threatens the cosy ties between media and mandarins

 The media , meanwhile , give the civil servants an unusually direct line of communication with the outside world . Newspapers have a circulation of 68 m copies a day , the highest in the rich world , and in each ministry they are part of a system known as the "" kisha club "" , or press club , which dates back to the 19th century and encourages intimate contact between the mainstream media and the bureaucracy . 
 In the past the clubs , whose members are self - selecting , have been criticised for closing ministerial press conferences to foreign correspondents , internet reporters and freelancers ( whom they often disparage as "" gossip - mongers "" ) . The system breeds information - sharing and discourages scoops . Critics say it stifles the sort of investigative reporting badly needed after Japan 's incestuous politics under the LDP . 
 Even some leading lights of the mass media acknowledge that change may be overdue . Yoichi Funabashi , editor - in - chief of the Asahi Shimbun , and one of Japan 's most respected journalists , welcomed Mr Hatoyama 's unprecedented decision to allow a handful of magazine and internet journalists to his inaugural news conference : "" Now the dam has broken . "" 
 Less understanding members of the media , however , may turn against Mr Hatoyama . Papers such as the Yomiuri , with a circulation of 10 m , have longstanding ties to the LDP ; its boss , Tsuneo Watanabe , was considered one of the party 's kingmakers . The press also has its eye on a scandal in which Mr Hatoyama admitted that his fund - raising organisation listed fictitious individual donations , including from dead people . This may return to trouble him . 
 Yet he would surely be foolish to leave the kisha club alone . His party won the election in August by a landslide partly because it promised more open government . The Japanese are keen to see an end to the murky back - room compromises in which elected officials took office , but bureaucrats were in power . If the press remains complicit with that system , Mr Hatoyama 's promise to end the status quo in Japan will be all the harder to achieve .",740,Japan,A30-186,IN TERM,True,The government of Yukio Hatoyama,4,True

THE past two years have rather obscured the charms of the free market. For those seeking to restore their faith, a trip to the Kashmir Valley provides some unlikely solace. The floating vegetable market that assembles at dawn on Dal Lake is perhaps the easiest market in the world to romanticise.
Shortly after the call to prayer sounds from the lakeshore shrine, farmers and traders cast off on narrow skiffs to truck, barter and exchange. Their boats bob and sway as bids and offers rise and fall. Sellers bump gently into buyers, putting a foot in the customer's boat to ensure that the deal does not drift away. Sprigs of mint, red coils of lotus root and bundles of knotted cabbage change hands for a few rupees, tossed from one boatman's lap to another. The terms of exchange float freely--and, best of all, the traders do not need bailing out.
The market, it is worth remembering, is just a form of human exchange. ""To be generically against markets would be almost as odd as being generically against conversations between people,"" notes Amartya Sen, a Nobel prize-winning economist. The recent crisis was not a generic failure of markets but a specific failure of finance. The meltdown did no discredit to markets that exchange goods and services as opposed to assets and securities. On Dal Lake, the traders know what they are getting; a buyer picks out the bad beans and tosses them overboard before money changes hands. And the goods are perishable, leaving little time for speculation.
Nonetheless, for many observers the retreat of Anglo-Saxon liberalism is one of the most telling parts of the new normal. Pimco's Mr El-Erian argues that the crisis has broken the spell of the ""mystical Anglo-Saxon model of liberalisation and deregulation"". Australia's prime minister, Kevin Rudd, recently heralded the overthrow of neoliberalism, ""the economic orthodoxy of our time"". In the run-up to Japan's recent election, Yukio Hatoyama, the victorious candidate for prime minister, campaigned against ""unrestrained market fundamentalism"".
Liberal reforms designed to increase the supply-side capacity of an economy, for example by removing barriers to entry, lose some of their urgency when the economy is too weak to achieve the potential it already has. And when financial markets are subdued, a reforming policymaker cannot count on a stockmarket rally to reward him. 
But in most industries the underlying logic of the Anglo-Saxon model is no more or less obvious today than it was two years ago. No one who believed, before the crisis, that manufacturing, telecommunications or steelmaking was the private sector's job should have changed their mind since. It is the Anglo-Saxon model of deregulated and liberalised finance that has lost its mystique. Bunches of swaps, sprigs of auction-rate securities and bundles of subprime loans--these are perhaps the hardest markets in the world to romanticise. Arm's-length or hands-on?
In the Anglo-Saxon model deep capital markets compete with banks, which also compete vigorously with each other. Transactions are carried out at arm's length, on the basis of public information, at competitive prices, and under contracts enforceable by third parties. 
Before the crisis this model was gradually gaining ground. Subir Lall of the IMF and his colleagues have documented the growth in ""arm's-length"" finance in countries traditionally dominated by hands-on banks, such as Germany and France. Ten years ago, in the wake of Japan's stagnation and the Asian financial crisis, Mr Rajan and Mr Zingales of the University of Chicago noted the ""slow but steady ascendance of the public markets"" and wondered if it heralded ""the eventual supremacy of the arm's-length, market-based, Anglo-Saxon system"".
That advance has dramatically reversed in the past two years (see chart 6). In the crisis, companies that had relied on selling marketable securities to raise working capital turned in desperation to their banks instead, tapping pre-arranged credit lines to keep afloat. At the same time many off-balance-sheet investment vehicles, supposedly at arm's length from the banks that sponsored them, quickly returned to their sponsors' bosoms when the markets failed to fund them. 
The traditional alternative to arm's-length finance is a more intimate system dominated by banks that maintain long-term relationships with their borrowers. In Japan, for example, companies traditionally turn to the same one or two banks for their financing. In Germany banks traditionally have block shareholdings in the companies they serve and put representatives on their boards. 
This clubbier finance offers three important advantages over the stand-offish Anglo-Saxon model. The banks know their customers better; they can smooth their lending to them during periods of misfortune; and they have ""skin in the game"", retaining some responsibility for the loans they extend.
But a financial system based on stable relationships has its own drawbacks. In such a system a small cluster of banks comes to a committee decision on whether a venture is worth backing or not. The process requires bankers ""to submerge their disagreements and accept a compromise"", as Franklin Allen and Douglas Gale point out in their book, ""Comparing Financial Systems"". 
The market, on the other hand, ""allows investors to agree to disagree"". Thousands can place their bets, based on their own hunches and insights. Markets, therefore, have an edge whenever diversity of opinion matters. When it comes to financing new technologies or fresh ideas, it is often better to leave the job to the ""wisdom of crowds"" (the title of a book on markets by James Surowiecki) than to the conventional wisdom of loan officers in a bank.
Mr Lall of the IMF and his co-authors have tried to show this empirically by looking at the industries that contributed the most to world growth from 1980 to 2001. Countries that specialised in those industries in 1980 duly prospered over the subsequent 20 years. Countries that had the ""wrong"" industrial mix did less well. But the researchers found that starting out with the wrong industries was less of a problem for countries with arm's-length financial systems. Mr Lall reckons these systems do a better job of reallocating resources from declining to growing sectors. The worst of both worlds
The markets most damaged by the crisis are those for securitised assets. Securitisation is supposed to turn a long-term banking relationship, ie, a loan, into an arm's-length transaction, the sale and purchase of a security backed by loans. But it ended up caught halfway between the two. Banks, as many commentators have noted, kept a surprising share of subprime securities on their balance-sheets rather than selling them on. According to a study by Hyun Shin of Princeton University and his co-authors, they suffered over 30% of the subprime losses in 2008.
This cross-bred model provided none of the advantages of arm's-length securitisation, which was supposed to move default risk away from the banking system, spreading it widely to those best placed to bear it. Nor did the model provide any of the advantages of ""intimate finance"". The banks had no relationship with the mortgage-holders or companies from whose borrowings their mincemeat securities were reconstituted.
Why did banks keep these securities, rather than sell them on? Mr Shin argues that banks held mortgage-backed securities so that they could borrow against them. The demand for securitised assets was, in essence, a demand for leverage. 
If banks could not borrow from pension funds or other investors, they turned to other banks instead. In this way they wove a cat's cradle of cross-claims on each other: one bank's liability was another bank's asset. This made the banking system more fragile, not less. If one bank took the precaution of trimming its assets, it deprived another bank of funding. Prudence in one institution might then inspire panic in another. Low-octane fuel
The banks' freedom to borrow will be regulated more tightly in the new normal. They will be required to hold more capital ""once recovery is assured"", the G20 finance ministers and central bankers said in September. Mr Shin argues that these capital requirements should tighten in booms, when banks become more eager to borrow, and ease in busts. 
Regulators in Europe and America may also oblige the creators of these securities to hold on to 5% of the value of the assets they distribute to others. Five per cent does not sound like much, but in 2007 they held an average of just 1.5%, according to the IMF's latest Global Financial Stability Report. The fund's calculations suggest that a 5% requirement would be enough to close some securitisation markets for good.
For its part, the IMF does not want to see securitisation return to its ""high-octane levels"" of 2005-07. But it nonetheless thinks regulators should mend securitisation, not end it. The banks, it points out, cannot fill the lending gap left by these markets. And the securities the banks now borrow against will need replacing with fresh ones as they mature. ""In light of the current constraints on lending capacity, restarting securitisation could help get credit growth moving again,"" it notes.
The IMF is right that the securitisation market's misery is hurting credit and therefore demand. But it need not do lasting damage to the economy's longer-run prospects. These markets are a dominant provider of mortgage finance and an important source of car loans and consumer credit. That is a good thing, as far as it goes. But home- and car-ownership are hardly the engines of economic growth. Indeed, the acceleration of credit during the securitisation era was not matched by an acceleration in economic output.
In the long run growth depends on replacing obsolete methods of production with better ones, and supplanting old industries with new ones. Repackaging subprime mortgages does not further that cause, but other arm's-length markets do. As Messrs Allen and Gale note, the Anglo-Saxon stockmarkets have been conspicuously successful at sponsoring new industries and reallocating resources to them. For all its excesses and eccentricities, these feats of economic reinvention are the Anglo-Saxon model's saving grace--and they remain vital to the process of industrial renewal, the subject of the next article.","The Anglo-Saxon model has taken a knock

IT WAS Saturday evening and Yukio Hatoyama, wearing a burgundy jacket and a cocky grin, was dancing with his fun-loving wife under the bright lights of a charity fashion-show. He could not have looked less like the ""grim-faced prime minister"", who hours earlier had been ambushed outside his home by reporters asking about his role in a fund-raising scandal.
He will need to keep up the brave face for several months yet. Just weeks after leading his party to an historic change of regime, Mr Hatoyama finds his campaign-finance activities under scrutiny by a dogged justice system. Prosecutors in Tokyo have given themselves until the end of the year to decide whether to press charges.
Mr Hatoyama can be under no illusion about the seriousness of the issue. He was, in effect, an accidental candidate in the August 30th election. A fund-raising scandal forced the resignation of his predecessor, Ichiro Ozawa. Mr Hatoyama's Democratic Party of Japan (DPJ) won the election by a landslide, evicting the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP), which had held power in Japan almost without interruption since 1955. One of the DPJ's main campaign pledges was for cleaner government.
Shortly before campaigning began, however, Mr Hatoyama had admitted that his political fund-raising organisation, named after yuai, the odd mixture of love and fraternity that is the keynote of his personal philosophy, had about 90 fictitious names, including those of dead people, on its donors' list. They were supposed to have given almost {Yen}22m ($220,000) from 2005-08. Newspapers reported that his organisation also received certificates enabling the supposed donors to deduct the contributions from their taxes.
Mr Hatoyama, whose family is so fabulously rich that his mother has helped bankroll his political career, blamed a longstanding employee for sloppy book-keeping. The issue went quiet during the election, but this week Mr Hatoyama confirmed that prosecutors had revived the investigation, and said he would co-operate fully. Prosecutors had summoned some of the donors named on his list for questioning. 
Some commentators suggest that the irregularities may have stemmed in part from embarrassment at the extent of his own family's contributions, and may not be viewed too harshly. In a poll this week by Yomiuri Shimbun, Japan's biggest-selling newspaper (which has pro-LDP leanings), 71% of respondents supported Mr Hatoyama's cabinet. Yet, coincidentally, the same percentage were unconvinced by his explanation about the case. 
If tax fraud is suspected, the case could be very ""dangerous"" for Mr Hatoyama and the DPJ, says Jiro Yamaguchi of Hokkaido University, who has worked as an adviser to the party. ""I hope it will blow out, but I think this could develop into a big money scandal."" It is also likely to prove a godsend for the LDP after its election rout. It is trying to revive itself under the new leadership of 64-year-old Sadakazu Tanigaki, an uninspiring former finance minister. The LDP was wracked by further despair this week when Shoichi Nakagawa, another ex-finance minister, was found dead at his home on October 4th. He was fired from the previous government after appearing to be drunk while giving a press conference at the G7 in Rome in February.
The attention on Mr Hatoyama could raise the pressure for campaign-finance reform in Japan. The DPJ hopes to revive a bill it submitted in June that would ban political donations by corporations, unions and other groups. Its motive is easy to understand: businesses provided the party with just {Yen}120m in 2008, compared with a whopping {Yen}2.9 billion for the LDP. But the success or failure of its reform efforts may depend on whether this is a scandal that Mr Hatoyama can dance around.

JAPAN'S nearest neighbours have long been less ready than has the rest of Asia to forgive and forget the country's aggressive past: a brutal colonisation of Korea in 1905-45 and a creeping occupation of China from 1931 leading to total war. Both projects were pursued ruthlessly and entailed civilian massacres, torture and slavery in factories, mines and military brothels.
So Yukio Hatoyama, Japan's new prime minister, has pleased the neighbours by promising that rule by his Democratic Party of Japan would transform Japan's relations with them. He made the pledge in both Seoul, where he met South Korea's president, Lee Myung-bak, on October 8th, and then in Beijing at a three-way summit with China's leaders. Unlike the weasel-worded Liberal Democratic Party, which long ran the country, Mr Hatoyama's new government, he says, ""has the courage to face up to history.""
Both Mr Lee and China's prime minister, Wen Jiabao, were delighted. Dealing honestly with historical matters, they affirmed, would make it much easier to tackle contemporary challenges together--notably, getting North Korea to give up its nukes, and deepening economic co-operation. Mr Lee said Mr Hatoyama had opened the way for ""future-oriented relations"". The talk now is of reviving old plans for an undersea tunnel linking South Korea and Japan. Emperor Akihito may visit South Korea, a first. Both South Korea and China have applauded Japan's proposal for a jointly compiled history textbook.
If only it were so simple. For all the bonhomie now, past hopes for ""future-oriented"" relations have often been frustrated. One problem is disputed territory (see map on previous page). Japan contests Dokdo, a rocky outcrop controlled by South Korea, while China claims the Senkaku, held by Japan. In addition, Japan contests Russia's control of four northern islands seized in August 1945. Over the years Chinese, Japanese, South Korean and Russian diplomats have all berated The Economist over our maps.
Japan insists Dokdo should be called ""Takeshima"". The South Koreans insist on the ""East Sea"" in place of the Sea of Japan. Over Dokdo/Takeshima, the websites of Japan's and South Korea's foreign ministries wage a virtual war, with pop-up cyber ""history halls"" and the like (in South Korea's case, in nine languages). Yet both sides look merely ridiculous. Japan's justification glides over the fact that its 1905 claim marked a first step in imperial annexation. South Korea argues that Dokdo has been ""Korean"" since 512, but uses the name for a country that did not exist until 1948. Competing for legitimacy with North Korea, the South also insists on the ""East"" rather than the ""Chosun"" Sea, since ""Chosun"", a much more common reference in old Korean documents, is these days associated with the North. Empty specks of rock do duty as stand-ins for wider and even touchier historical issues. 
Things would be better if Japan were now readier to call a slave's spade a spade. It has apologised many times for its brutal past, but only in vague terms, expressing ""remorse"" for ill-defined damage. Most apologies, including the one that has since become a template, by the then prime minister, Tomiichi Murayama, at the 50th anniversary of the war's end, appear to say sorry to the Japanese people first. Mr Hatoyama does not call for the imperial family to break the so-called chrysanthemum taboo by admitting guilt on behalf of the wartime emperor, Hirohito.

When America's Congress called on Japan in 2007 to apologise for the comfort-women system, Ichiro Ozawa of the DPJ, now the party's secretary-general, threatened a Diet resolution damning the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. His demeaning of the comfort women was grotesque but symptomatic: even today, many Japanese believe the atomic horror washed away any guilt for devastation in other parts of Asia. Small comfort
But then the South Korean government gets more worked up about Japanese claims on a guano-flecked rock more than it does about the comfort women. After all, many of the men sending women to the front were, well, Koreans, working for the colonial authorities. Later, from 1948, the instruments and executors of Japanese repression were hitched to the new South Korean state--under American military tutelage to boot.

Caption: Economist.com/blogs/banyan","A truce is unlikely to herald lasting peace between Japan and its neighbours 
 JAPAN 'S nearest neighbours have long been less ready than has the rest of Asia to forgive and forget the country 's aggressive past : a brutal colonisation of Korea in 1905 - 45 and a creeping occupation of China from 1931 leading to total war . Both projects were pursued ruthlessly and entailed civilian massacres , torture and slavery in factories , mines and military brothels . 
 So Yukio Hatoyama's has pleased the neighbours by promising that rule by Yukio Hatoyama's Democratic Party of Japan would transform Japan 's relations with them . Yukio Hatoyama made the pledge in both Seoul , where Yukio Hatoyama met South Korea 's president , Lee Myung - bak , on October 8th , and then in Beijing at a three - way summit with China 's leaders . Unlike the weasel - worded Liberal Democratic Party , which long ran the country , Yukio Hatoyama's new government , Yukio Hatoyama says , "" has the courage to face up to history . "" 
 Both Mr Lee and China 's prime minister , Wen Jiabao , were delighted . Dealing honestly with historical matters , they affirmed , would make it much easier to tackle contemporary challenges together -- notably , getting North Korea to give up its nukes , and deepening economic co - operation . Mr Lee said Yukio Hatoyama had opened the way for "" future - oriented relations "" . The talk now is of reviving old plans for an undersea tunnel linking South Korea and Japan . Emperor Akihito may visit South Korea , a first . Both South Korea and China have applauded Japan 's proposal for a jointly compiled history textbook . 
 If only it were so simple . For all the bonhomie now , past hopes for "" future - oriented "" relations have often been frustrated . One problem is disputed territory ( see map on previous page ) . Japan contests Dokdo , a rocky outcrop controlled by South Korea , while China claims the Senkaku , held by Japan . In addition , Japan contests Russia 's control of four northern islands seized in August 1945 . Over the years Chinese , Japanese , South Korean and Russian diplomats have all berated The Economist over our maps . 
 Japan insists Dokdo should be called "" Takeshima "" . The South Koreans insist on the "" East Sea "" in place of the Sea of Japan . Over Dokdo / Takeshima , the websites of Japan 's and South Korea 's foreign ministries wage a virtual war , with pop - up cyber "" history halls "" and the like ( in South Korea 's case , in nine languages ) . Yet both sides look merely ridiculous . Japan 's justification glides over the fact that its 1905 claim marked a first step in imperial annexation . South Korea argues that Dokdo has been "" Korean "" since 512 , but uses the name for a country that did not exist until 1948 . Competing for legitimacy with North Korea , the South also insists on the "" East "" rather than the "" Chosun "" Sea , since "" Chosun "" , a much more common reference in old Korean documents , is these days associated with the North . Empty specks of rock do duty as stand - ins for wider and even touchier historical issues . 
 Things would be better if Japan were now readier to call a slave 's spade a spade . It has apologised many times for its brutal past , but only in vague terms , expressing "" remorse "" for ill - defined damage . Most apologies , including the one that has since become a template , by the then prime minister , Tomiichi Murayama , at the 50th anniversary of the war 's end , appear to say sorry to the Japanese people first . Yukio Hatoyama does not call for the imperial family to break the so - called chrysanthemum taboo by admitting guilt on behalf of the wartime emperor , Hirohito . Nor does Yukio Hatoyama suggest that the Diet ( parliament ) pass a law expressing national contrition instead of merely making statements . So , on this , Yukio Hatoyama does not look like a mould - breaker . But then the leaders of South Korea and China may not want Yukio Hatoyama to be . Being able occasionally to beat Japan for its lack of remorse is not all bad .

AFTER five weeks in power, the Democratic Party of Japan (DPJ) is still enjoying a honeymoon. The government's approval rating stood at 73% in mid-October--only a tiny dip from the 75% it enjoyed when it took power in September. That followed a landslide election victory ending more than 50 years of nearly uninterrupted rule by the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP). The DPJ has put forward many popular changes. But it is also making people nervous. Some of its policies seem to turn back the clock on earlier reforms, dilute the DPJ's campaign pledges or require especially forceful resolve to take on powerful, entrenched interests.
Still, the small reforms have been potent. It named a gadfly activist on homelessness to a government commission. It said that long-term residents should be given the right to vote--a move aimed at Koreans and Taiwanese who may have lived in Japan for generations yet lack citizenship. It wants to let women keep their family names after marriage. 
Every day newspaper headlines trumpet the latest change--even before the Diet (parliament) opens on October 26th. The public likes it. Yet the bigger, more complicated changes are generating unease. On October 20th the government said it would reverse the privatisation of Japan Post. On the same day the finance minister, Hirohisa Fujii, said the government may need to back away from its commitment to cut spending, by issuing more debt to pay for stimulus measures and the budget. Taken together, the two statements expose the DPJ's inconsistency. 
Postal privatisation, the hallmark of former prime minister Junichiro Koizumi's tenure in 2001-06, is most contentious. Once a popular symbol of reform, it has since been demonised, as an example of how the cold wind of market forces hurts ordinary Japanese. The government said it will reunify the four businesses hived off under the previous policy--banking, insurance, delivery and offices--and postpone a planned sale of shares to the public. 
To supporters of privatisation, the post office has everything to do with politics and economics and little to do with the mail. It was a source of patronage for LDP politicians, by doling out lucrative jobs to people who could also help get out the vote. And it served as the government's piggy bank: its banking and insurance assets total about {Yen}300 trillion ($3.3 trillion), around 70% of which is spent on government bonds to pay for pork-barrel projects. Splitting apart the units and introducing competition was meant to increase transparency, reduce misuse of the assets and improve service.
Yet opponents of privatisation care most about the post offices themselves. Older Japanese regard post offices, which play a social function (postmen check up on old people, for example, and pick up their prescriptions), as a mark of civilisation. They are uncomfortable with the closures of smaller offices that business-minded reforms entail. Shizuka Kamei, the minister who led the effort to undo privatisation, wants post offices actually to expand into some of these activities, such as care for the elderly.
The biggest problem for the DPJ--which aspires to fiscal conservatism--is the financial hole its government finds itself in. After vowing to curtail government spending, ministries put forward a record budget request of {Yen}95 trillion for 2010, surpassing this year's {Yen}89 trillion. The huge sum includes the DPJ's campaign pledges, such as assistance for families, the poor and the unemployed. Yukio Hatoyama, the prime minister, says he wants to cut it by {Yen}3 trillion or more during the budget negotiations that take place until December. 
The government aims to overhaul the budget process, by starting from scratch each year and scrutinising items, rather than rolling over previous budgets and blindly accepting the bureaucrats' demands. Indeed, Mr Hatoyama already got his ministers to cut {Yen}3 trillion in ""wasteful spending""--almost entirely from public-works projects--in the 2009 budget, to pay for some of the DPJ's social policies. 
Yet the government is in a bind. As a result of the downturn, tax revenues this year may fall below {Yen}40 trillion, far less than the expected {Yen}46 trillion. To plug the gap, Mr Fujii, the finance minister, said the government may sell more government bonds. But the DPJ had earlier vowed it would not issue more than the {Yen}44 trillion in new debt set by the previous LDP government. It may now surpass {Yen}50 trillion. In recent days bond prices have fallen and yields have risen in anticipation. 
Japan has little breathing space. It already has the highest debt-to-GDP ratio of any rich nation, approaching 200% of GDP (see chart on previous page), and this is estimated to reach 250% by 2014. One-fifth of the annual budget is used to finance the debt. Interest rates are low--but if they rise, it will wreak fiscal havoc. 
The government faces in an acute form the dilemma confronting any reforming new government: how to maintain both popularity and principle. The party rode to power vowing to neuter the power of the bureaucracy. Returning the post office to government control goes down well with some voters but does the opposite. It promised fiscal conservatism. But this means it cannot afford its popular social policies. No wonder, that, for now, the Japanese people are enjoying the small changes.","The DPJ 's excitable first weeks in office

AS USUAL at such shindigs, lofty dreams of pan-Asian economic integration got a good airing at a regional leaders' summit held in Thailand on October 25th. Buoyed by signs of recovery in recession-bound countries, and unbroken expansion in China, India and Indonesia, leaders spoke glowingly of a free-trade zone that would link the world's most dynamic economies. Yukio Hatoyama, prime minister of Japan, the region's largest economy, if one of its worst-performing, said such a zone should have a common currency and aspire to ""lead the world"". Not to be outdone, Australia's prime minister, Kevin Rudd, proposed a pan-Pacific economic community that would include America and collaborate on security. 
Lest anyone get too carried away, officials were on hand to caution that such grand plans would not happen overnight. Mr Hatoyama, who is trying to give Japan a more prominent role in Asia without jeopardising its security guarantee from America, described his proposal as a ""medium-term objective"". Indeed, talk of an East Asian community, with perhaps even a single currency, is nothing new. But the chatter has grown louder since America blundered into a financial crisis that sapped its ability to act as the motor for global growth. As Abhisit Vejjajiva, Thailand's prime minister, put it, the old model of satisfying Western consumers ""will no longer serve"" the region. 
There is tremendous scope for Asian countries to boost intra-regional trade and investment. On trade it is already happening: intra-East Asian trade flows rose to 42% of total trade in 2008, up from 32% in 1990, according to the Asian Development Bank (ADB). But much of this is in commodities and semi-finished goods, with America, Japan or Europe as the final destination. China is the source of much of this growth, but it is rarely the end-consumer. Instead, it remains a competitor to other developing Asian countries for rich-world markets. 
The ten-member Association of South-East Asian Nations (ASEAN), which played host to the summit, likes to tout its own efforts to build a European-style single market of over 500m people. The first phase of a free-trade zone is due to take full effect on January 1st. Six members have already cut tariffs on manufactured goods, though not on farm produce. ASEAN has also been busy signing free-trade pacts with regional powerhouses such as China and India. These could become the basis of a pan-Asian trade bloc, reckons Kiat Sittheeamorn, Thailand's chief trade negotiator. 
But these agreements rarely add up to much, as they must satisfy all ASEAN members, some of which already have their own bilateral deals with the third party. The end result is yet another set of rules for importers to work out, says Jayant Menon, an economist for the ADB. He says ASEAN countries deserve praise for cutting tariffs in a non-discriminatory way (ie, on goods produced both inside and outside ASEAN). Executives complain, though, that red tape and other non-tariff barriers are a far bigger hurdle. ASEAN's nascent free-trade zone also excludes services, and tiptoes around labour mobility. 
A deeper problem for ASEAN is its cohesion and credibility. It at last has a legal charter, but is bound by a strict policy of non-interference that prevents any version of Europe's pooled sovereignty. It began as a cold-war security alliance without a common vision. Four decades on, it has yet to find one. Political, cultural and economic disparities loom large. Even leaving aside the perennial distraction of Myanmar, a repressive military dictatorship that Western allies find hard to sit down with, mutual mistrust and outright hostility between countries make a mockery of ASEAN's encomiums on unity. They also bode poorly for the resolution of disputes in a closer economic union. Bad blood
The latest spat is between Thailand and Cambodia, whose prime minister, Hun Sen, went out of his way to antagonise the summit's host, Mr Abhisit. Over the past year, the two countries' armies have clashed several times over a disputed border temple. Naturally, this is never discussed by ASEAN, lest it upset either side. A new row is over Thailand's former prime minister, Thaksin Shinawatra, who lives in exile and is wanted at home on a criminal conviction. Hun Sen told reporters at the summit that his ""old friend"" Mr Thaksin was welcome to seek asylum in Cambodia and to be his economic adviser. 
Thai diplomats fumed that arrest and extradition would be the right way to treat a fugitive. But that seems unlikely after Hun Sen's extraordinary show of support. By taking sides in Thailand's politics, Cambodia's leader ""went for the jugular"", says Thitinan Pongsudhirak, a Thai political scientist. Sensibly, Mr Abhisit has not risen to the bait, though the anti-Thaksin People's Alliance for Democracy this week staged a small protest outside Cambodia's embassy in Bangkok. The group has previously stirred trouble at the border, where Hun Sen has threatened to shoot any Thai trespassers. In 2003 anti-Thai riots swept Cambodia's capital over a rumoured nationalist slight by a Thai actress. Relations today are hardly much better. So much for ASEAN brotherhood. 
None of which need stop South-East Asian countries from trying to promote cross-border economic co-operation. After more than a decade in the works, a currency-swap scheme among Asian central banks is beginning to look like a facility that might conceivably be used. But ASEAN looks too weak and divided to manage faster and deeper regional integration. Indeed, four leaders skipped the summit's opening ceremony. No wonder, then, that ASEAN's biggest member, Indonesia, which also happens to be its most vibrant democracy, seems to set greater store by its seat at the G20 table.

YUKIO HATOYAMA, Japan's prime minister, likens his role to that of a conductor trying to achieve ""harmony""--one of his favourite words--from a pickup orchestra (for which read, novice cabinet). So far the result has been cacophony. Ministers have waged war in public and have floated ideas that, in some cases, are downright ludicrous. At times they have even challenged Mr Hatoyama's authority. 
To his supporters, this reflects a refreshingly open debate in a new ruling party after decades of cloistered dealmaking. When Mr Hatoyama's Democratic Party of Japan (DPJ) swept to power in September, it was largely because of voters' frustration at half a century of rule by the ""iron triangle"" of Liberal Democratic politicians, bureaucrats and big business. Mr Hatoyama promised a more open and genuinely democratic style of government.
But discord in the cabinet, and a woeful absence of discussion about the budget next year and beyond, have left many worried. Foreign allies are wondering what the new government stands for. Investors are beginning to vote with their feet, driving up Japanese government-bond yields.
The most glaring problem is a diplomatic one: a dispute in relations with America over an American air base in Okinawa, a southern island, which is the subject of a bilateral treaty that the Hatoyama administration wants to review (see Banyan). America has done itself few favours with the new government. In the run up to Barack Obama's visit to Japan on November 13th, the administration has at times treated its strongest ally in the region with the sort of bossiness that the DPJ came to power vowing to stand up to.
But disagreement within the Hatoyama government over whether the air base should be moved within the island, off it, or even out of Japan altogether has made matters worse. The foreign ministry's insistence on reviewing the treaty so soon after taking office has also distracted both sides from a more important topic: the need to recalibrate their alliance, which next year turns 50, in a way that better reflects post-cold-war realities. 
Mr Hatoyama's difficulties come, in part, from the DPJ's coalition partners. To build an upper-house majority before elections next summer, he joined forces with two small parties, the Social Democrats and the People's New Party, offering both their leaders cabinet positions. The pacifist Social Democrats oppose all American military bases in Japan, a view the DPJ does not share. 
The leader of the People's New Party is even more of a problem. An anti-capitalist maverick, Shizuka Kamei, who is banking and postal-reform minister, seems to be running an alternative government. His plan to force banks to offer a loan moratorium to small firms has irked Hirohisa Fujii, the finance minister, and rattled markets. Inflammatory comments claiming big business is responsible for a spate of suicides and murders in Japan have embarrassed the rest of the cabinet.
Yet Mr Kamei has been able to challenge Mr Hatoyama with impunity. ""If Prime Minister Hatoyama wants to fire me, go ahead. But he can't,"" he declares. When he drafted in a former civil servant to reverse the privatisation of the postal service, he got away with it, even though one of Mr Hatoyama's most popular campaign promises was to keep former mandarins out of plush jobs.
Those who know Mr Hatoyama say it is not his style to be dictatorial. He may also be sweating it out, hoping that success in the upper-house elections will enable him to eject his awkward bedfellows. But if Mr Hatoyama does not turn more assertive soon, says Gerald Curtis, a veteran Japan watcher at Columbia University in New York, ""the image of a government in disarray, pulling in different directions and spending time back-pedalling from half-baked or unbaked policy ideas, will grow stronger and undermine...support.""
And as if the cabinet is not causing enough headaches, Ichiro Ozawa, head of the DPJ and the man considered the ""shadow shogun"" in Japanese politics, is also throwing his weight around. On November 10th he attacked Christianity, calling it an ""exclusive and self-righteous religion"". Not a message likely to endear him to the visiting Americans. 
It may not feel like it while Mr Obama is in town, but Mr Hatoyama has an even more powerful constituency demanding reassurance: the bond market. Since he took office, analysts say derivatives markets have suggested there are growing fears among ""bond vigilantes"" of rising government-funding costs in a few years' time. Gross debt already stands at a staggering 180% of GDP. In a recent report, JPMorgan, an American bank, gave warning that the costs of coping with a shrinking and ageing population could push that ratio to 300% in a decade, and send debt-service costs soaring.
With the deficit in the current fiscal year expected to hit 10% of GDP, there are concerns that next year the government will be forced to raise its borrowing target above the current 44 trillion yen ($489 billion). This week Fitch Ratings said it may review Japan's debt rating if the government issues substantially more debt.
The concerns have flourished partly because there is so little clarity about future budgets. The DPJ promised to set up a new body, the National Strategy Bureau, to set medium-term fiscal goals, to be headed by the deputy prime minister, Naoto Kan. But nothing has been done about implementing this promise in parliament, though it was considered a priority on taking office.
Markets were somewhat reassured this week when Mr Fujii, the finance minister, acknowledged that rising bond yields were indeed a worry. But he has recently appeared to pin his hopes on a rebounding economy to raise tax revenues and on eliminating waste to cut the deficit. Neither can be counted on.
An economic rebound would anyway be a cyclical benefit, whereas there is pressure from many parts of the DPJ for a structural increase in spending in order to provide European-style welfare protection. Their voices may grow louder even as Mr Fujii tries to hold down borrowing. Mr Hatoyama will have the final say. Perhaps he needs to remember, amid cacophony, that some of the best conductors are despots.","The Democrats ' debut has been worryingly unharmonious -- and the "" bond vigilantes "" are starting to make groaning noises , too 
 Yukio Hatoyama's likens Yukio Hatoyama's role to that of a conductor trying to achieve "" harmony""--one of Yukio Hatoyama's favourite words -- from a pickup orchestra ( for which read , novice cabinet ) . So far the result has been cacophony . Ministers have waged war in public and have floated ideas that , in some cases , are downright ludicrous . At times they have even challenged Yukio Hatoyama's authority . 
 To Yukio Hatoyama's supporters , this reflects a refreshingly open debate in a new ruling party after decades of cloistered dealmaking . When Yukio Hatoyama's Democratic Party of Japan ( DPJ ) swept to power in September , it was largely because of voters ' frustration at half a century of rule by the "" iron triangle "" of Liberal Democratic politicians , bureaucrats and big business . Yukio Hatoyama promised a more open and genuinely democratic style of government . 
 But discord in the cabinet , and a woeful absence of discussion about the budget next year and beyond , have left many worried . Foreign allies are wondering what the new government stands for . Investors are beginning to vote with their feet , driving up Japanese government - bond yields . 
 The most glaring problem is a diplomatic one : a dispute in relations with America over an American air base in Okinawa , a southern island , which is the subject of a bilateral treaty that the Yukio Hatoyama administration wants to review ( see Banyan ) . America has done itself few favours with the new government . In the run up to Barack Obama 's visit to Japan on November 13th , the administration has at times treated its strongest ally in the region with the sort of bossiness that the DPJ came to power vowing to stand up to . 
 But disagreement within the Yukio Hatoyama government over whether the air base should be moved within the island , off it , or even out of Japan altogether has made matters worse . The foreign ministry 's insistence on reviewing the treaty so soon after taking office has also distracted both sides from a more important topic : the need to recalibrate their alliance , which next year turns 50 , in a way that better reflects post - cold - war realities . 
 Yukio Hatoyama's difficulties come , in part , from the DPJ 's coalition partners . To build an upper - house majority before elections next summer , Yukio Hatoyama joined forces with two small parties , the Social Democrats and the People 's New Party , offering both their leaders cabinet positions . The pacifist Social Democrats oppose all American military bases in Japan , a view the DPJ does not share . 
 The leader of the People 's New Party is even more of a problem . An anti - capitalist maverick , Shizuka Kamei , who is banking and postal - reform minister , seems to be running an alternative government . His plan to force banks to offer a loan moratorium to small firms has irked Hirohisa Fujii , the finance minister , and rattled markets . Inflammatory comments claiming big business is responsible for a spate of suicides and murders in Japan have embarrassed the rest of the cabinet . 
 Yet Mr Kamei has been able to challenge Yukio Hatoyama with impunity . "" If Yukio Hatoyama wants to fire me , go ahead . But Yukio Hatoyama ca n't , "" he declares . When Yukio Hatoyama drafted in a former civil servant to reverse the privatisation of the postal service , Yukio Hatoyama got away with it , even though one of Yukio Hatoyama's most popular campaign promises was to keep former mandarins out of plush jobs . 
 Those who know Yukio Hatoyama say it is not Yukio Hatoyama's style to be dictatorial .

ASIANS complain that when George Bush chose Iraq and terror ism as his main arenas in foreign affairs, it was at their expense. Barack Obama intends his first Asian trip as president, which begins in Tokyo on November 13th, as proof of change. As well as Japan, the tour takes in Singapore, China and South Korea. Engagement in the region, he says, is critical to America's future. Advisers even suggest that what he achieves there will help define Mr Obama's presidency. Of course, they say that about a lot of things on his plate. But to judge by ordinary folk, the region wishes him well. Many Indonesians think of Mr Obama as one of their own. In Japan students of English have emptied the bookshops of his collected speeches.
Some activity suggests there is indeed a new engagement. In July, the American secretary of state, Hillary Clinton, signed ASEAN's Treaty of Amity and Co-operation. The ten-member Association of South-East Asian Nations had been largely ignored by Mr Bush. This weekend Mr Obama will meet ASEAN's leaders as a group, which is a first. His administration reached out to the thuggish junta in Myanmar, reversing a policy of isolation, and on November 10th said Mr Obama's special envoy to North Korea would go to Pyongyang for talks with the obstreperous nuclear state (after close consultation with South Korea and Japan first). The president has taken pains to define China as a ""strategic partner"", one without whom America has little hope of tackling everything from the global economic crisis to climate change and nuclear proliferation. And Mr Obama's energetic support this year for the G20, with its Asia-heavy membership, can be read as a tacit acknowledgment that in economic and political terms the world's centre of gravity has shifted away from the G8 group of wealthy nations.
And yet. American policy in Asia--or, just as often, the lack of it--retains the power to unsettle its friends in the region. Take Japan, the cornerstone of America's Asian alliances. There, some people ask whether the hand extended to America's adversaries might reasonably be extended to its allies too. The Democratic Party of Japan (DPJ), which recently swept away the old political guard, wants to put Japan's security alliance with America on a more ""equal"" footing, one in which America does not call all the shots. Many Americans, too, see disadvantages in a skewed relationship. Among other things, it discourages Japan from taking up more international responsibilities.
Soon after coming to office, Japan's prime minister, Yukio Hatoyama, suggested revisiting an unpopular plan, agreed under the previous government, to move an American air base on Okinawa, a tiny southern island with an overwhelming American military presence. The Obama administration could have shown patience towards a government still finding its feet. But it was confrontational from the start. Changing the agreement, said the defence secretary, Robert Gates, was out of the question. Japan, a State Department official told the Washington Post, was a bigger problem than China--an extraordinary judgment. It is true that Japan could have handled the problem better (
). But America has done itself few favours and the best Mr Obama can do now is remind both sides of the strategic ends of their alliance and call for a rethink about the means. Next year's 50th anniversary of the pact would provide an occasion for that.
Elsewhere in Asia, a new engagement, however welcome, is not thought to be enough. Many of China's neighbours, eyeing its rise, want the reassurance of a more robust American presence. In a recent speech in Washington, DC, Singapore's patriarch, Lee Kuan Yew, surprised his audience by raising concerns about China's naval build-up, something South-East Asia's leaders rarely talk about in public. ""If you do not hold your ground in the Pacific"", he told the Americans, ""you cannot be a world leader."" In private, Mr Lee was blunter: ""You guys are giving China a free run in Asia,"" the Financial Times reports him saying. As well as engaging China, America must also balance it. Celebrate and monitor
Mr Lee had America's economic influence in mind as well as its military presence. Take free-trade agreements (FTAs). China has signed FTAs with most of its neighbours, including with ASEAN as a whole, often on terms more favourable to China than to its partners. Talk is growing about the possibility of a super-FTA between China, Japan and South Korea. Asians are also negotiating FTAs with the European Union. In contrast, the ratification of a landmark agreement between South Korea and America is mired in Congress. The administration has taken retaliatory measures against imports of Chinese tyres. It has even drawn back from perhaps the only regional project seeking genuinely open trade, the Transpacific Partnership, led by a handful of liberal states. Meanwhile, South-East Asia's battered exporters long for America to take a tougher stance with China over its undervalued currency that is, in practice, pegged to the declining dollar while other regional currencies rise. Mr Obama has been squishy on the issue, not wishing to poison Chinese-American relations.
So Mr Obama will be monitored, as well as celebrated. On trade, an American commitment to seek an FTA with ASEAN would send the right signal. So would re-engaging with the Trans pacific Partnership. On Myanmar, whose abuses are poisoning ASEAN's own future, the president needs to be clear to the region's leaders, including Myanmar's prime minister (whom he will meet), that he will bring the pariah state in from the cold only with the release of Aung San Suu Kyi and the launch of a democratic process involving the opposition and minorities. And Mr Obama needs to signal that America will balance a rising China in such a way that China's neighbours never have to take sides.author

IT TOOK Barack Obama nearly a year in office to get to East Asia. When he did, it was for an intensive nine-day obstacle course, which he tried to negotiate with the placatory charm and openness to dialogue that have marked his diplomacy. Unsurprisingly, it went down well, but produced little of substance.
The centrepiece of the trip was China, which he visited at a critical juncture in the world's most important bilateral relationship. China handled the visit with ambivalence. It was keen to encourage Mr Obama's friendly approach and his willingness to recognise China as a fellow great power. But it was also clearly nervous of a charismatic young president far better than China's standoffish leaders at appealing to ordinary citizens (""voters"", as they are known in America).
The courteous but rigidly formal reception afforded Mr Obama stood in sharp contrast to that given the previous Democratic president to visit China, Bill Clinton, in 1998. Chinese television aired an interview with Mr Clinton and gave live coverage to his meeting with Chinese students and to a joint press conference with President Jiang Zemin. With Mr Obama, Chinese officials were careful to limit opportunities for embarrassment. In Shanghai, Mr Obama staged what the Americans described as a ""town hall"" meeting with young Chinese. It was shown only on Shanghai television, along with a painfully slow feed relayed through the internet. 
Later, in Beijing, Mr Obama held a ritual meeting with reporters alongside President Hu Jintao. But unlike in 1998, no questions were allowed. Mr Hu grimly gripped his lectern as Mr Obama delivered a statement in which he spoke of the universality of America's human-rights values. Mr Obama did not, however, seem inclined to goad his hosts at a time, as he put it, when the bilateral relationship ""has never been more important to our collective future"". The decade since Mr Clinton's visit has seen a huge shift in the relative balance of power. China's hectic growth has made it an indispensable partner both in redressing global economic imbalances and in curbing carbon emissions
Mr Obama's trip predictably failed to produce breakthroughs on either issue, though a lengthy joint statement outlined measures to step up co-operation on developing clean energy. Mr Obama alluded to his hope that China's exchange rate might become more market-driven, but there was no hint of agreement. One new area of co-operation is in outer space. The two countries declared a plan to open a dialogue on manned space flight, hitherto resisted by America because of the strong military links to China's manned space programme. 
The two sides announced that they would hold another dialogue on human rights by the end of February, their first such discussions in nearly two years. The dialogue has been sputtering on and off for nearly 20 years. But as usual during American presidential visits, China this week tried to keep dissidents out of sight. Several were reportedly rounded up by the police before the trip. 
Officials displayed similar nervousness in their preparations for the ""town hall"" meeting in Shanghai. Chinese participants were coached beforehand on how they should pose their questions. They were also carefully selected. Many were members of the Communist Youth League, an organisation that grooms potential party members. America, Mr Obama said, would ""always speak out"" for its core principles. But as he also said, ""more is to be gained when great powers co-operate than when they collide"". Bow row
A similar concern for avoiding head-on clashes marked Mr Obama's time in Tokyo on November 13th-14th. For seething American nationalists, his only achievement there was to embarrass the nation by bowing to Emperor Akihito. There was all the customary talk-show outrage over what much of the rest of the world would view as a gesture of cultural courtesy. 
The Japanese saw his trip differently. In Tokyo, Mr Obama made one of his main foreign-policy speeches so far, laying out his vision for America's deeper engagement with Asia and styling himself as America's first ""Pacific president"". Throughout, it was peppered with gushing references to Japan--delighting a country that fears it has fallen into China's shadow. 
This amounted to a well-crafted appeal to the Japanese people, in case the government they recently elected seeks to put more distance between their country and America. Yukio Okamoto, a former special adviser to two Japanese prime ministers, thought the visit ""brilliant"", in ""consolidating the popular feeling that the United States is a friend to Japan"". 
The potential strains in America's relationship with Japan are easy to see. The biggest is the fate of an American helicopter base on Japan's southern island of Okinawa. The new government of Yukio Hatoyama, the prime minister, is keen to review a bilateral agreement reached in 2006 that would relocate the base within Okinawa. The Obama administration believes the treaty should largely stand. 
In Tokyo Mr Obama and Mr Hatoyama promised to ""move expeditiously"" to settle the matter. On November 17th the two governments began high-level talks, which officials privately said were aimed at reaching agreement this year. Yet Mr Hatoyama has made clear that he does not understand the word ""expeditiously"" to bind him to a specific timescale. This puts him at odds not just with the Americans, but with his own foreign minister, Katsuya Okada, who is taking part in the high-level talks.
As soon as Mr Obama had left Japan, Mr Okada travelled to Okinawa to see for himself how the islanders view the base treaty. Mr Hatoyama is likely to be sensitive to the feelings of Okinawans, many of whom oppose it and want the helicopters moved off the island altogether. But mainland Japanese may now be more sympathetic to the treaty, especially having heard from Mr Obama's own lips how important he believes it is for America's--and Japan's--security.
From Japan Mr Obama flew to Singapore, for a regional summit in need of reassurance about America's renewed commitment to Asia and the Pacific. He attended a meeting of South-East Asian leaders that included Myanmar's prime minister--the first such high-level contact with the Burmese junta in four decades. 
There is no pariah it seems, with whom Mr Obama is not prepared to risk dialogue--even North Korea, which has long hankered after the kudos of bilateral talks with America. But the willingness of his administration to talk to Kim Jong Il's nuclear-armed thugs jangles some nerves in South Korea, the last stop on Mr Obama's Asian tour. There is also frustration in Seoul that a free-trade agreement between the two countries languishes in America's Congress. Differences, however, were brushed aside during Mr Obama's visit. South Korea is probably not too alarmed at Mr Obama's penchant for conciliation. It knows that Mr Kim is a past-master at proving the limits of dialogue.","The president pays Asia the compliment of courtesy ; rewards are not immediate

). Sadly neither the Hatoyama administration nor the central bank has shown any intention of tackling the latest incarnation of the deflationary curse.
That is a grave miscalculation. Prices in Japan may not yet be in a downward spiral, but deflation is entrenched: even the Bank of Japan (BoJ) acknowledges that prices may fall for at least another two years. The more they do so, the bigger the burden of Japan's debt becomes, and the more households and firms are likely to retrench. As it is, high real interest rates act as a powerful brake on Japan's incipient recovery.
Japan may have muddled through such scares before, most recently after a five-year splurge of liquidity unleashed by the BoJ between 2001-06. There may be some complacency that because deflation did not spiral downwards then, it will not do so this time. But a few years ago the world economy was strong and Japan could export its way back to health. This time around, global conditions are weaker and the yen is one of the world's strongest currencies. It is a credit to Japan's exporters that they are doing well despite such conditions. Largely thanks to them, Japan's economy jumped forward in the third quarter, though there are already signs that the pace of recovery may be slowing. But to nail deflation once and for all, bolder steps by monetary and fiscal authorities are needed. 
The BoJ can start by being more assertive. It is almost as if it is so exasperated by the flaky achievements of its previous anti-deflationary efforts that it would rather sit back and wait for a recovery. But that is a defeatist attitude. If nothing else, it should publicly revive discussion of alternative plans to reflate the economy. That could include increasing government-bond purchases, or setting itself a monetary target not just based on a positive inflation rate, but on robust growth of nominal GDP. If the recovery falters, the BoJ could go further, exploring the use of negative interest rates on bank balances, which would encourage banks to lend money rather than hoarding it at the central bank. Such extraordinary measures would almost inevitably lead to a weaker yen, which would irritate Japan's trading partners. But Japan cannot get out of the deflationary mess if the yen keeps strengthening.
Mr Hatoyama's administration, meanwhile, should stop pestering the BoJ about deflation and face up to its own responsibilities. In the short run that includes keeping fiscal-easing measures in place, at least until there is less deflationary slack in the economy. (So far the government has prevaricated about the need for continued fiscal stimulus.) In the longer term, it should strive to raise Japan's trend rate of growth, which many reckon has fallen to about 1% a year from 1.5-2% previously, as the population shrinks.
That means boosting productivity through labour-market reform, immigration policies and free trade, none of which the ruling Democratic Party of Japan has been keen on so far. Its goal of prompting growth in the underachieving domestic side of Japan's economy is a fine one, and certainly there is room for huge productivity improvements in some areas, particularly agriculture. But that should not come at the cost of harming exporters, which the DPJ has myopically threatened to constrain through union-friendly wage controls. Big bang-bang
In short, Japan needs a double-barrelled big bang to jolt its economy back to life. If that threatens to spook investors, the authorities should have up their sleeve a credible long-term plan to restore order to public finances--but one which should be put in place only when growth is on a firmer footing and deflation has been truly licked. If the consequence of all this additional stimulus is a weaker yen, so be it. It will be a small price to pay if the eventual result is more openness and buoyancy in one of the world's largest economies.","Anybody who thinks deflation is no longer a threat should look at Japan and its flailing authorities

IT IS one of the hottest shows in town. People queue up, replace their shoes with slippers, and enter a gymnasium where TV cameras are filming. What they have come to see looks like ""Dragons' Den"", a popular TV show. But bureaucrats, not entrepreneurs, are the ones begging for cash to fund their pet projects. And politicians give the thumbs up or down.
This is budget-balancing, Japanese-style. The new administration of Yukio Hatoyama has come to office with big spending plans, which it intends to pay for by scrapping wasteful expenditures of the sort that, it says, helped keep its opponents in power for half a century. Judging by the TV audiences, the public is impressed. The trouble is that Japan has a fiscal hole likely to approach 10% of GDP next year, or about {Yen}50 trillion ($500 billion). Such gestures are like using a toothpick to fill it in.
That means the government may need to issue more bonds next year to bridge the gap, unless there is a strong pickup in growth or the government abandons some of its spending pledges. The prospect of more borrowing has spooked the government-debt market recently. The jitters reflect the sheer size of Japan's public-sector debt, which next year is expected to be twice as big, on a gross basis, as the country's GDP. On a net basis (offsetting the government's financial assets), it is smaller but still among the highest in the OECD. 
As bond yields edged higher recently, several Wall Street banks issued warnings about potentially crippling debt-service costs. Their case was strengthened by evidence of mounting deflationary pressures and expectations that Japan, with its shrinking population, will be unable to grow fast enough to pay down its debt. 
JPMorgan, for instance, has calculated that even if ten-year yields on Japanese government bonds rose by just one percentage point over the next decade (and the fiscal deficit increased each year as a result of social-security and other payments), the government's debt-service costs would triple because of a steadily rising stock of debt. It also said that an ageing-related decline in household savings might lead to a current-account deficit by 2014. That could make Japan more dependent on foreigners for its borrowing needs.
Even the bears acknowledge that there is scant likelihood of Japan blowing up in the short term. There are several reasons to remain calm, notably the remarkable loyalty of Japanese debtholders over the past 15 years. By some estimates more than 93% of Japanese debt is held domestically, which means that the government need never default because it could simply print money to pay the debt off.
This home bias also helps explain why, though the stock of debt is huge, debt-servicing costs as a percentage of GDP have been relatively low compared with Japan's OECD peers (see chart). Even at the peak of their recent run-up, ten-year Japanese-government bonds only yielded a miserly 1.43%, but in a deflationary environment they were still attractive to Japanese investors in real terms. What's more, the government is the world's largest creditor, with plenty of foreign assets to sell. And Japanese citizens are sitting on another {Yen}1,410 trillion of financial assets. These comfortably exceed the government's debt. As a last resort they could be heavily taxed if the government ran into trouble.
Japan would, indeed, become more exposed to foreign creditors if the current account were to slide into deficit, but that is unlikely unless the world economy takes a turn for the worse and oil prices soar--two things which are unlikely to happen simultaneously. More likely, a worsening current-account balance would weaken the yen, which hit a 14-year high against the dollar on November 26th.
The problem is that even those who remain relaxed about Japan's debt are deeply pessimistic about other aspects of the economy. Deutsche Bank talks of an ""iron hexagon"" comprising a fiscal deficit, current-account surplus, yen appreciation, falling prices, low nominal interest rates and economic stagnation. ""The most realistic path for the Japanese economy is not a crash but a sustained decay or hibernation,"" writes Mikihiro Matsuoka, its chief economist in Japan.
Hibernation is nothing new. Nominal GDP has increased at an annual rate of 0.1% since 1991. In the third quarter GDP grew at a quarterly rate of 1.2% in real terms, the fastest growth in the G7, but in nominal terms, as a result of the pernicious effects of deflation, it fell by 0.1%. Deflation creates other headwinds. It means real interest rates are abnormally high for a country just emerging from a crunching recession. As long as it persists, the debt-to-GDP ratio will get steadily worse.
That suggests the authorities should take drastic steps to reflate the economy, jolting it out of its stupor and weakening the currency. Yet bizarrely, the Bank of Japan seems to think its credibility is more at risk from reignited inflation than from the stigma of mild deflation. Provided there is no downward spiral in prices, it believes the economy will eventually heal itself.
The Hatoyama administration has barely begun to consider how to prolong the recovery, let alone pay down debt in the long run. It only inserted an ""economic growth strategy"" into its election manifesto as an afterthought. Analysts believe it is too worried about winning upper-house elections next summer to do anything but pussyfoot on economic policy. Japan needs stimulus in the short term and credible plans for fiscal retrenchment in the long term. At the moment it has neither.

IN ITS few months in office there have been doubts about the seriousness of the new team running the world's second-largest economy. Yukio Hatoyama, the prime minister, airily talks of healing Japan's fiscal crisis with fraternal politics. He has appointed a blathering anti-capitalist to oversee the banks. And businessmen complain that they rarely have a chance to meet him or his ministers. 
In the past fortnight, however, Japan's economic stewards appear to have woken up to the depth of the country's malaise, and to the need for them to do something about it. Their focus has been deflation--consumer prices started falling in April. The concerns have been exacerbated by a surging yen, which on November 27th reached its strongest level against the dollar in 14 years. 
On December 1st, under strong pressure from the government, the Bank of Japan (BoJ) announced it would launch a 10 trillion yen ($115 billion) short-term lending facility, with a fixed 0.1% interest rate, to boost liquidity and attempt to reverse deflation. The measure, worth just 2% of GDP, disappointed those in the financial markets who had hoped the BoJ would buy more government bonds as part of a concerted effort with the government to weaken the currency. 
It also raised worries about central-bank independence. Masaaki Shirakawa, the only candidate for BoJ governor last year to be supported by Mr Hatoyama's Democratic Party of Japan, won immediate praise from the prime minister for his efforts--even though the markets were underwhelmed. For days the BoJ had been badgered by the government to resort to quantitative easing (a form of stimulus in which a defined sum of money is injected into the economy). Mr Shirakawa described the new lending facility as ""quantitative easing in a broad sense"". 
For all the concerns about the BoJ, however, many observers welcomed signs that the administration was beginning to take a lead on the matter. At last it is beginning to resemble a government endeavouring to wield power. On December 2nd Mr Hatoyama promised trade-union leaders that the government would step up its own pump-priming measures by introducing a supplementary budget in the new year. News reports suggested it would be worth at least 4 trillion yen, which is much more than had been expected. 
Encouragingly, the deputy prime minister, Naoto Kan, who had been selected by Mr Hatoyama to work out a medium-term fiscal strategy for Japan, has at last emerged from the shadows to lead the anti-deflation brigade. His strong voice on the issue has helped unify the cabinet. It is not yet clear, however, that he has the courage to orchestrate the structural reforms Japan so badly needs. 
Japan's economic problems are deeply entrenched and Asia's economic recovery is still fragile. Moreover, some of the plans hatched by the Hatoyama administration to revive the economy look disturbingly anti-business. But identifying deflation as a big problem is a hopeful sign. Even if the authorities have not launched an effective joint effort to weaken the yen this week, they have at least served notice that they could eventually do so.","The new government begins to get to grips with the ailing economy

BETWEEN them, they won less than 3% of the vote in the August election for the lower house of the Diet, or parliament. In the 242-seat upper house, they hold just ten seats. Both are led by loose cannons, one an anti-capitalist, the other a liberal feminist. So why, Japan's ruling party is being asked, are its two tiny coalition partners able to hold it--and by extension the management of the world's second-largest economy--to ransom?
This is a question of growing importance for Yukio Hatoyama, the fledgling prime minister. In an opinion poll on December 7th, the main reason given for the party's falling popularity (still a robust 59%) was his lack of leadership. This month he has allowed the two cabinet members appointed from his Democratic Party's coalition partners to mount direct challenges to his authority on the economy and foreign policy.
One of them, Shizuka Kamei, the minister for postal reform, boycotted a cabinet meeting on December 4th at which a new fiscal-stimulus package was to be ratified, saying the package was not big enough. That delayed its approval until December 8th, when it was increased fractionally to {Yen}7.2 trillion ($80 billion).
Mr Kamei's intransigence incensed Naoto Kan, the deputy prime minister. ""We are a three-party coalition, but at the same time this is the Hatoyama administration, not a Kamei-led one,"" he reportedly hissed at Mr Kamei in a cabinet meeting. 
Meanwhile, another coalition-party cabinet member, Mizuho Fukushima, threatened on December 3rd to resign from the government unless it forced an American military base to leave Okinawa, a Japanese island south of the mainland. The base had been the subject of delicate talks with the Obama administration, which argues that the future of the Futenma marine base on Okinawa is enshrined in a 2006 bilateral agreement. On December 8th Japan said it had suspended the talks, partly because of the coalition issue.
The frustrations led Richard Armitage, a former American deputy secretary of state, to ask in Tokyo this week whether keeping a coalition together was more important than maintaining an American-Japan alliance. ""It's like the tail wagging the dog,"" Uichiro Niwa, chairman of Itochu, a large trading company, told a conference in Tokyo organised by The Economist.
Economists are also concerned, not least because third-quarter growth was revised sharply downward, to 1.3% from an annualised 4.8%, on December 9th. Instead of focusing on fiscal-stimulus measures in the latest session of the Diet, the government chose instead to back a controversial bill sponsored by Mr Kamei that would enable small companies to delay debt payments to banks. That means this week's additional spending plans will not make it through parliament until next year, and so, says Kyohei Morita, chief economist in Japan for Barclays Capital, they may not have any effect until economic growth has slowed even further. 
For its part, the ruling party argues that it is important to keep the coalition intact until upper-house elections next summer when it hopes to win at least seven more seats. That would give it a majority in both chambers, and hence greater freedom to pursue its own agenda. But since its so-called partners seem so determined to undermine that agenda, the strategy seems, at the very least, a dangerous gamble.","The DPJ 's fractious coalition partners disrupt economic and foreign policy

WHEN Asian boosters of regional integration talk about their cause's glorious future they tend not to mention its dodgy past. Yet 80 years ago a Bengali, Rabindranath Tagore, Asia's first Nobel laureate, stirred crowds in India, China and Japan by calling for a pan-Asian spiritualism to counter Western materialism. Both he and Sun Yat-sen, China's anti-imperialist exile, greatly admired the idea, fostered by Japan, of an ""Asia for the Asiatics"". 
Well, none of this looks so good to Asians now. Japan's enslavement of much of Asia gave pan-Asianism a bad name. And, although decolonisation after the second world war led to calls for a kind of Asian commonwealth, post-war fraternity soon crumbled, as cold-war fault-lines hardened. And if there is a transcendent reality that unites Asians today, it's the iPhone.
Yet the dream of greater integration refuses to die. In September Japan's new prime minister, Yukio Hatoyama, proposed a sweeping East Asian Community. This caused a stir, since Japan had slapped down a similar idea peddled in the 1990s by Mahathir Mohamad, Malaysia's former leader, for a regional ""caucus"" (without Caucasians, it was noted). More recently, in Sydney from December 3rd-5th, Australia's prime minister, Kevin Rudd, invited 200 officials and academics from 22 countries to flesh out what he calls an Asia-Pacific Community (or, more modestly, an Asia-Pacific community). 
Much is vague about what Mr Hatoyama wants. But, nudged in the right direction, his idea could develop in a practical way, helping to boost trade and investment. Over the past couple of decades Japan has failed to foster an economy led by domestic consumption, so it still depends for growth, despite the global crunch, on trade. Trade integration is the only way forward. China, Japan and South Korea, deciding to pursue ""future-oriented"" relations among themselves (ie, don't mention the war), have agreed to look at a three-way free-trade agreement (FTA).
It is early days. Neighbours complain that Japan has few practical proposals for regional co-operation. Meanwhile, easily the region's two biggest economies, Japan and China, would be better reaching a bilateral FTA first. China needs Japanese environmental and other expertise, while ageing Japan needs high-growth investment returns. A two-way agreement, much more easily reached than a three-way one, would bring $1 trillion in efficiencies, claims Andy Xie, a China-based economist. After the foundation for an East Asian free-trade area was laid, it would be a relative doddle to plug it into the much smaller emerging free-trade block being developed by the ten-member ASEAN (Association of South-East Asian Nations). That is all down the road. For now, Mr Hatoyama's proposal means the world's second-biggest economy, long ambivalent about its links with the rest of Asia, has decided to pursue regional integration. 
Mr Rudd's ambitions have a more strategic sweep. Many have long argued that Asia's institutional architecture falls short, with a mess of competing structures that include the big if ineffectual APEC (Asia-Pacific Economic Co-operation, a talk-shop on trade), ASEAN, ASEAN+3 (ie, plus Japan, China and South Korea) and the newish and still wobbly East Asia Summit (EAS, made up of ASEAN+3, India, Australia and New Zealand). Rationalise these structures, some argue, and Asia will be on the way to becoming another European Union--superior of course, thanks to Asia's famous work ethic and felicitous flair for consensus. 
Rather than think first about acronyms, the Rudd idea, as Hadi Soesastro and Peter Drysdale, respectively Indonesian and Australian academics, put it, is grounded in big shifts in the structure of regional and world power. Well before the financial crisis, economic and strategic weight was clearly moving to Asia, thanks largely to the rise of China and India. But the region lacked the institutional capacity to respond to these structural shifts, and to how the rest of the world was reacting to them. And they are, to put it mildly, far-reaching. One change, for example, is China's potential to challenge the primacy of American power in East Asia.
The financial crisis helped the region to wake up to another reality: the scale of Asia's global responsibilities. Asia was slow in recognising the contribution to the global crisis of home-grown, mainly Chinese, imbalances, and has been slow in helping shape a new global order. East Asia, write Mr Soesastro and Mr Drysdale, ""had significant prudential responsibility and it failed collectively at every stage to exercise it."" 
The message is now getting home, which helps explain why Mr Rudd's idea of a ""community"", roundly panned when he first unveiled it, is now viewed with more respect. The G20's rapid eclipse of the G7 as the chief forum for co-ordinating global economic policy argues for heavier-hitting Asian arrangements to allow Asia's G20 members better to represent the continent. Handling economic crises and monitoring climate-change obligations also point towards stronger regional architecture, both for formulating and policing commitments. Into the soup
How to build the new architecture? Here the discussion slides into the alphabet soup of regional groupings, for no one can bear a brand-new organisation and a whole new set of meetings. To date, ASEAN has been at the heart of regional arrangements. Yet China and India have now eclipsed the grouping, which uncomfortably includes one truly nasty regime (Myanmar's), and other lesser dictatorships. To balance China's rise, some want the EAS to be expanded to include the United States and Russia. China seems to favour ASEAN+3 as the lead institution. But then India would complain, and others would be unhappy if America were left out. Still, that these countries are even thinking about the possibilities is a giant step forward for integrationists.author

WHO rules Japan, the emperor or the shogun? That question vexed America when it first sought to trade with Japan in the 1850s. Today, China has no doubts. The answer is the ""shadow shogun"", Ichiro Ozawa, a master manipulator who secured an historic victory for the Democratic Party of Japan (DPJ) in August elections.
In the past week Mr Ozawa has hogged the limelight on two occasions to convince China--and remind Japan--who is the boss. On December 10th he led what looked like a modern-day version of a medieval tribute visit, flying 645 people, including 143 DPJ members of parliament, to Beijing. They filled five aeroplanes. His meeting with the premier, Hu Jintao, made the top of the nightly news in China, an achievement in a country where many people still loathe the Japanese.
A day later, Japanese nationalists were outraged to learn that their emperor, Akihito, had been forced, apparently under indirect pressure from Mr Ozawa, to grant an exceptional audience to Xi Jinping, China's vice president. Normally, protocol requires 30 days' notice before a meeting with the ailing 75-year-old emperor. On this occasion it was offered with only a few days' warning. Flag-waving protesters denounced what they saw as Mr Ozawa's ""treacherous"" misuse of the emperor and railed against the DPJ's overtures to China.
Though the DPJ secretary-general denied that he had ordered the breach of protocol, he nevertheless waded into an unusual public tiff with the emperor's hermetic household. Announcing the meeting, the sovereign's grand steward lamented the way political strings had been pulled. Mr Ozawa shot back that if the courtier didn't like it he should resign.
In some ways, the episode reveals how much the rules of the game are changing under the DPJ. The genuflection to Beijing occurs just when Japan's relations with America have been strained by a dispute over a military base. It appears even richer in symbolism after Barack Obama's deep bow to Emperor Akihito last month.
Mr Ozawa's show of force happened when Yukio Hatoyama, the prime minister, is looking weak in his dealings with an unruly cabinet. That a man who is not even a minister can wield so much power behind the throne (or thrones) further undermines the prime minister's authority and may give the impression that Japan's transition to an open democracy is less than meets the eye. Another reason, perhaps, to endear him to friends in China.

WHEN Japan's 77-year-old finance minister submitted his resignation to Yukio Hatoyama, the prime minister, on January 6th, the ostensible reason was poor health. The week before he had been admitted to hospital complaining of exhaustion and high blood-pressure. But Hirohisa Fujii's main problem was not illness so much as a case of bad blood in Mr Hatoyama's ruling clique. Mr Fujii, say people who have spoken to him, was fed up with the power wielded over Mr Hatoyama by Ichiro Ozawa, secretary-general of the ruling Democratic Party of Japan (DPJ). 
After some hesitation Mr Hatoyama accepted Mr Fujii's resignation. He replaced him with Naoto Kan, the deputy prime minister. He lacks experience of economic policy, so the world's second-biggest economy will be in novice hands. But the main other candidates were in Mr Ozawa's bad books. That may have ruled them out. 
Mr Ozawa occupies an unparalleled position in Japanese politics. As architect of the DPJ's historic victory in elections last August, the party believes it owes him a debt of gratitude, and needs him to manage a big win in upper-house elections this summer. Yet he is also widely seen as a dark presence, whose role hardly squares with the DPJ's vows to make Japanese politics more open. All requests to DPJ lawmakers for public-spending projects are channelled through him, and he often appears to put the party's interests before those of the government. Recently, he has flaunted his authority by taking more than 100 DPJ lawmakers on an official trip to China, and inviting them to a banquet at his home on New Year's Day. Increasingly, the ""shadow shogun"", as he is known, is stepping into the limelight.
The incident that appears to have slighted Mr Fujii came during budget wrangling last month, when Mr Ozawa single-handedly--and without Mr Fujii's agreement--persuaded the prime minister to scrap a campaign promise to cut petrol taxes. But the hostilities date back further. Last year Mr Fujii led a successful campaign to stop Mr Ozawa becoming the DPJ's prime-ministerial candidate, when his office was being investigated over a political-financing scandal. People close to Mr Ozawa continue to be quizzed by prosecutors; on January 6th the Asahi Shimbun reported that a Tokyo district court would summon Mr Ozawa for questioning. Some believe Mr Ozawa's recent assertiveness may be a shot across the prosecutors' bows.
In choosing Mr Kan as the new finance minister, Mr Hatoyama has picked a man whose relations with Mr Ozawa are considered neutral. Mr Kan was a prominent social activist before entering politics and is a former health minister. He has been in charge of developing a long-term strategy to deal with Japan's huge debt and other matters, and has been increasingly outspoken on the need to tackle deflation. His appointment is unlikely to destabilise Japan's financial markets. However, nor is it likely to dispel the impression that Mr Hatoyama is, at times, worryingly like a puppet on Mr Ozawa's string.

Increasingly , the "" shadow shogun "" , as he is known , is stepping into the limelight . 
 The incident that appears to have slighted Mr Fujii came during budget wrangling last month , when Mr Ozawa single - handedly -- and without Mr Fujii 's agreement -- persuaded the prime minister to scrap a campaign promise to cut petrol taxes . But the hostilities date back further . Last year Mr Fujii led a successful campaign to stop Mr Ozawa becoming the DPJ 's prime - ministerial candidate , when his office was being investigated over a political - financing scandal . People close to Mr Ozawa continue to be quizzed by prosecutors ; on January 6th the Asahi Shimbun reported that a Tokyo district court would summon Mr Ozawa for questioning . Some believe Mr Ozawa 's recent assertiveness may be a shot across the prosecutors ' bows . 
 In choosing Mr Kan as the new finance minister , Yukio Hatoyama has picked a man whose relations with Mr Ozawa are considered neutral . Mr Kan was a prominent social activist before entering politics and is a former health minister . He has been in charge of developing a long - term strategy to deal with Japan 's huge debt and other matters , and has been increasingly outspoken on the need to tackle deflation . His appointment is unlikely to destabilise Japan 's financial markets . However , nor is it likely to dispel the impression that Yukio Hatoyama is , at times , worryingly like a puppet on Mr Ozawa 's string .

A GOLDEN wedding is a terrible time for a marital crisis. But that is the danger unless Japan and America settle a rift over moving an American base on the Japanese island of Okinawa. The dispute could undermine security in East Asia on the 50th anniversary of an alliance that has served the region well. Tough as it is for Japan's new government, it needs to do most, though not all, of the caving in.
Fear of China and Russia brought America and Japan close during the cold war. The Futenma base in Okinawa, an island poised neatly between Taiwan and the Korean peninsula, was both a symbol of their alliance and a strategic asset of great value. But its location, slap bang in the middle of Ginowan City, suits neither the marines nor the Okinawans. 
Last year, after 13 years of wrangling, the Japanese and American governments agreed on an alternative site, in a sparsely populated part of the island (
). As part of the deal, the Americans agreed to reduce their troop numbers in Okinawa and move some to American territory in Guam. But not everybody was happy with the agreement. The Democratic Party of Japan, which has since become the governing party, opposed it. The Okinawans, who billet more than half the 50,000 American troops in Japan, regarded the mainlanders' insistence that they must house the Americans as a symptom of their second-class citizenship. When Yukio Hatoyama, then DPJ leader and now prime minister, promised to move not just some but all of the Americans off the island, Okinawans caught a whiff of historical redress. They voted overwhelmingly for his party last summer. 
Mr Hatoyama has said that he will decide on the base's fate by May. In the meantime, he is managing the affair badly. He has neither suggested an alternative to Okinawa nor reassured allies such as South Korea and Taiwan, which rely on American deterrence. But he is not the only one to blame for the mess. The merits of the plan were poorly explained by both America and Japan's former Liberal Democratic rulers. The Obama administration, in a rare display of toughness, has tried to browbeat Japan's new government into submission, giving the impression in a country long fearful of ""karaoke diplomacy"" that it expects Mr Hatoyama to sing to its tune.
On January 12th Hillary Clinton and her Japanese counterpart, Katsuya Okada, declared in Hawaii that the disagreement would not mar their countries' alliance. But there is a concern that the dispute over the base is widening the distance that has grown between the two countries, partly because they have not resolved how to deal with the rise of China. Don't wait another 13 years
Japan's desire to become a more equal partner in its relationship with America is understandable, but leaving the future of Futenma in doubt is the wrong way to go about it. Instead, Japan should shoulder more of the burden for its own defence. It could also do more to help prevent terrorism, piracy and nuclear proliferation in its near-abroad. And it needs to set out its foreign-policy goals more clearly. It seems keen to balance relations with America against closer ties to East Asia, particularly China, but has not spelled out how this realignment would affect its still vital security links with America. 
As for Futenma, Japan would be recklessly endangering its own security if it allowed the row over the base to put the alliance at risk. Unless he can come up with an alternative on the mainland, Mr Hatoyama will have to break his promise to the Okinawans--and make it up to them somehow. Perhaps a reinvigorated alliance between America and Japan that engages more fully with the region, including China, will eventually allow America to reduce its presence on Okinawa. If this crisis achieves that, so much the better.","Do n't let a festering row over a military base in Japan put a 50 - year alliance at risk

ON THE wall of the Sakima Art Museum in this bustling city is a work called the Battle of Okinawa. It depicts the suffering of local civilians during the American invasion of Okinawa in 1945, partly at the hands of murderous-looking Japanese troops. On the roof of the museum, there is a more mischievous--but equally effective--work of anti-war polemic, this time directed against the Americans. A platform looks out over the fenced-off Futenma Marine Corps Air Station, which stretches out to the sea over an area larger than Central Park in New York. In just a few minutes, your correspondent witnessed a transport plane taking off, three fighter jets roaring overhead and a military helicopter rumbling to life. An aircraft-carrier might be less noisy.
The base was seized by the American army in 1945, but since then Ginowan has grown to surround it with offices, homes and government buildings. Ginowan is only a small city, of 92,000 people; even so, imagine how New Yorkers living around Central Park would feel, were it an air base bristling with marines belonging to a country that once colonised them. That gives a sense of why Futenma, however much it has helped keep the peace in East Asia, has long needed to move.
That much America and Japan agree upon. Negotiations to find a replacement have dragged on since 1996, the year after three American marines gang-raped a 12-year-old Okinawan girl. But since the Democratic Party of Japan (DPJ) took power last September, the issue has opened an unusually deep wound in relations between the two countries. It still festers. On January 12th Katsuya Okada, Japan's foreign minister, and Hillary Clinton, America's secretary of state, agreed not to let the dispute stop them discussing other ways to bolster their military alliance. But Mrs Clinton continued to press for Futenma to be relocated in Okinawa.
The friction is partly to be expected. In opposition the DPJ repeatedly objected to an agreement to move part of the air station, including landing strips, to a pristine bay in north-eastern Okinawa, in exchange for the withdrawal of 8,000 marines and their families to American territory in Guam. Yukio Hatoyama, the new prime minister, personally promised Okinawans during the election campaign that Futenma would be shunted off the island.
That promise swiftly put his government at loggerheads with the Obama administration. As one of her first acts of diplomacy last February, Mrs Clinton signed an agreement under which Japan would contribute $6 billion to relocating Futenma. The other signatory was from the former Liberal Democratic government, which was doomed to suffer an electoral rout in August. But a deal, the Obama administration insisted to the DPJ, was a deal. Some analysts believe that may have been an overly bossy assessment. Even under the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP), which for much of its 53 years in power was a pliant American ally, the Futenma relocation was often a source of friction. 
Indeed, over the decades relations with the LDP had not always been smooth. They got off to a good start. The 1960 Treaty of Mutual Co-operation and Security turned out to be a strikingly successful insurance policy. The Japanese paid the premiums by offering American troops bases and cash. The Americans promised nuclear and non-nuclear American deterrence, which helped underwrite peace in the region, while at the same time acting as a ""cork in the bottle"" against possible Japanese remilitarisation. 
But after the cold war relations appeared to come adrift. When Junichiro Koizumi, prime minister from 2001-06, pledged strong support for the ""war on terror"" after September 11, 2001, America hoped Japan would take on a global security role commensurate with its economic power. But it did not. According to a recent study by Michael Finnegan of the National Bureau of Asian Research, a think-tank in Seattle, America and Japan no longer see eye-to-eye on ""what constitutes a threat to their shared interests"". Both countries still refer to the alliance as a cornerstone of their security policies, but it is, says Mr Finnegan, a brittle one.
Defenders of the alliance argue that it has done more than keep the peace: it has enabled Japan to keep its military spending low, and attract global status in other ways, notably economic. Nonetheless, some in Japan feel the country has subordinated itself to America, and this has riled nationalists. And in Washington, DC, critics accuse Japan of ""cheap-riding"" on American security guarantees.
It is against this backdrop that the new government's review of the Futenma accord raised hackles in Washington. Adding to the sense of drift was Tokyo's decision to end an eight-year maritime refuelling mission for troops fighting in Afghanistan this month. It has also promised to investigate secret agreements in the 1960s and 1970s that enabled nuclear-armed American warships to enter Japan. 
Above all, since the DPJ took power, it has been unclear how its goal of partially balancing Japan's ties to America with closer ones to China would affect the American alliance. The 50th anniversary of the security treaty might be a good chance to update the accord to reflect China's rise. But security analysts say the Futenma dispute threatens the mutual trust needed for such an undertaking. Payback time
To make matters worse, most Okinawans seem determined to hold Mr Hatoyama to his word about removing the base altogether. As the painting at the Sakima gallery suggests, Okinawa nurtures an historic grudge against the mother country, piqued by the second world war massacre. Many locals feel that for too long Tokyo has outsourced American bases to the island--it houses 60% of American forces and their families in Japan--and offered only grubby fiscal handouts in return.
Critics accuse the Japanese authorities of producing a cooked-up environmental assessment, which skates over the dangers the new base would pose to the dugong, a rare sea mammal that grazes on sea grasses near the site of the proposed airstrips. Even supporters of the new base admit that it is hard to judge the full ecological impact because America has given imprecise figures about how many troops and aircraft would remain.
If the Hatoyama administration does break its promise to the Okinawans, it would be ""suicidal"", says Yoichi Iha, mayor of Ginowan and a staunch opponent of the agreement. And even then, some fear that protesters could make it very difficult to start construction work. A mayoral election takes place on January 24th in Nago, the city where the new base is proposed. Relocation is the main campaign issue. If the incumbent who supports it is ousted, that will be a strong indication of the level of anger. An election for governor of Okinawa in November is likely to bring the same tensions to the fore island-wide. But with America sticking to its guns, the Hatoyama administration is bound to upset one side or other. Its battle of Okinawa has only just begun.","Wrangling over an American base puts Japan 's new government in a bind

He is considered fair game for all manner of theories about his mood swings, his loneliness and his craftiness. Colleagues describe him as an unobtrusive man; enemies find him cold and hard as a hatchet. 
His politics are as mysterious as his mind. Bag-carrier to two brazenly corrupt bosses of the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) in the 1970s and 1980s, he quit the party in 1993. Leading the rival Democratic Party of Japan (DPJ), he eventually succeeded in driving the LDP from power last September. He did so using the dark arts of political patronage and cronyism so closely associated with the LDP. As they all too seldom were under the former regime, such practices are now in the dock. 
The heat on Mr Ozawa rose sharply on January 15th and 16th with the arrest of his two former secretaries and a current one, on suspicion of violating a law on political fund-raising. The arrests were part of an investigation by the Tokyo prosecutor's office into the source of the funds for a {Yen}352m ($3.8m) land-purchase in the city in 2004 by Mr Ozawa's investment arm. 
Mr Ozawa's enemies in the justice system may have an axe to grind. The loyalty of the judiciary, like that of most civil servants, has for decades been to an establishment closely allied to the LDP. The prosecutors, meanwhile, have leaked furiously to the media, which, say Mr Ozawa's defenders, hints at an establishment conspiracy. Many in the party, including Yukio Hatoyama, the prime minister, have backed Mr Ozawa, who says the money for the land purchase came from his own family's bank accounts.
Mr Ozawa's decision to clear his name while clinging to his exalted position in the DPJ has already started to spatter the party with mud. It has not helped that Mr Hatoyama has also been involved in a political fund-raising scandal, for which one of his aides has been indicted. Opinion polls show public support for the government falling precipitously. This bodes ill for the DPJ's efforts to secure approval of an {Yen}7.2 trillion supplementary budget for the fiscal year ending in March, and for next year's budget. Both are exercises intended to keep Japan's precariously sluggish economy from sliding back into recession.
More worrying, analysts say, it may undermine the DPJ's chances of winning a full majority in upper-house elections in July. That could mean a continuation of the scrappy coalition that has undermined Mr Hatoyama's first months in office--or worse, political gridlock.
With polls indicating that most Japanese favour his resignation, Mr Ozawa has changed tack and agreed to be questioned by prosecutors. But the ruling party's position is tricky. Some believe Mr Ozawa is the glue that binds it together; he has huge support among first-time lawmakers who consider him a genius at winning elections. But others fear he may now be an electoral liability. For the DPJ, it may well be best if he resigns, not least because since last year's elections, voters will have developed a taste for kicking out those who let them down. If not, and the party shrinks from kicking him out, the crowning paradox of his life may be damaging the party he so badly wants to succeed.","The DPJ may pay a high price for standing behind its fixer - in - chief

WHAT our colleague, Charlemagne, calls ""bubbles of optimism"" over China have been popping in Western capitals, as China has taken a hard line against internal dissent, proven unhelpful in efforts to tackle both climate change and Iran's growing nuclear threat, manipulated its currency and launched cyber- attacks on Western computer networks. China, muscling its way to global prominence, is not quite the partner the West had been cultivating. Striking, then, that in Japan the bubble of optimism, among the country's new leaders, is only inflating.
Soon after the Democratic Party of Japan (DPJ) swept into office nearly five months ago, the prime minister, Yukio Hatoyama, unveiled a vision for an East Asian Community (EAC). For all that it was dreamy and disjointed, it had at its heart a rapprochement between Japan and China leading towards regional integration. Asia, Mr Hatoyama reaffirmed, was Japan's ""basic sphere of being"". As for integration, fraternity was to be the glue.
Then late last year the DPJ's secretary-general, Ichiro Ozawa, travelled to Beijing at the head of a 639-strong mission, including 143 parliamentarians with whom a beaming President Hu Jintao took the trouble to be photographed, each in turn. Mr Hu doesn't smile like that for Westerners. Back in Tokyo, Mr Hatoyama horrified sticklers for imperial protocol by insisting that Mr Hu's heir-apparent, Xi Jinping, pay an impromptu call on Emperor Akihito. Now rumours suggest Mr Hatoyama may make a visit of remorse, the first by a Japanese prime minister, to Nanjing, site of a massacre by Japanese forces in 1937. In return (and at less political cost), Mr Hu may pay respects to the nuclear victims of Hiroshima. Japan under the DPJ seems to get on better with China than it does with its ally and security guarantor, the United States. Relations with the United States are strained over the relocation of a military base for American marines on Okinawa, leading to worries over the future of the two countries' alliance, keystone to security in the western Pacific. 
Economic logic argues for closer ties with China, which has already overtaken America as Japan's biggest trading partner, and is about to overtake Japan's economy to become the world's second-biggest. After not one but arguably two ""lost decades"", an ageing population cannot drive demand in Japan. It must hitch itself to the Chinese juggernaut. A strategic vision, too, lurks somewhere in the idea of an EAC. Mr Hatoyama has committed Japan to cutting greenhouse-gas emissions by a quarter by 2020. He thinks Japan can lead Asia towards a low-carbon future. 
But contradictions lurk too. The idea makes a nod to China's rise. Yet it assumes Japan's rightful lead in proposing a new regional architecture, while impressing Japan's technological prowess on China. The impulse is deeper-seated than Mr Hatoyama might admit. The story of modern Japan is of the use of Western arms and technology to overturn China's centuries-old regional dominance. China now intends to restore the natural order, and does not need directions from others, least of all Japan. It has made only the minimum polite noises about an EAC. As for the green technology that Japan can share, both sides say it is a good thing but are infuriatingly sparing with the details. Besides, since the December summit in Copenhagen, China has hinted it might go its own way on climate change.
Popular Japanese attitudes towards China suffer from the same doublethink. In one recent poll, most of those questioned wanted a ""warmer"" political relationship with their big neighbour. But most also wanted the prime minister to visit Yasukuni, Tokyo's militarist shrine, on remembrance day. That is one issue guaranteed to send China-Japan relations into the cooler. A sense of Japanese superiority over coarse, authoritarian China is also widespread. More than one Japanese professor has told Banyan that Japan is the true guardian of Chinese culture.
History wars, still far from resolved, point to the limits of rapprochement. So too do maritime disputes over territory. But a huge constraint is the fiscal one. Greying Japan is burdened with deflation, stagnant growth and a national debt close to 200% of GDP. Japan lacks the resources (and the will) for the kind of bold strategic moves, putting Japan at the heart of Asia, at which Mr Hatoyama and Mr Ozawa hint. Even a more autonomous security policy, out from under America's wing, is almost a non-starter. Japan has cut its defence spending in recent years, to just 1% of GDP. It has grown more dependent on the United States, not less. Behind China's smile
This is where strains over the alliance really matter for the security of the whole region, not least because of Taiwan. On January 24th the Okinawan township picked, after painful years of talks, by the United States and Japan's previous government as the destination for the relocated marine base elected a mayor resolutely opposed to the move. Popular concerns about the ""occupation mentality"" of American forces are valid. But Mr Hatoyama, according to colleagues, was sleepwalking when he reopened the issue. Now he cannot go back. Local politics and national security are on a collision course. Mr Hatoyama has said he will decide over the base by May. But moving it anywhere else in Japan will face local resistance too.
As Yoichi Funabashi, editor of Asahi Shimbun puts it, if the new administration bungles relations with Washington, it will look diplomatically inept at a time when power relations in Asia are shifting fast. That might spell the end of the hapless Mr Hatoyama. So it is hardly cynical to assume that one aim behind China's outbreak of smiling is to drive a wedge between a slightly clueless Japan and its longstanding protector. After all, Japan would be its base were America to come to Taiwan's rescue in the event of a mainland attack. author

 WHAT our colleague , Charlemagne , calls "" bubbles of optimism "" over China have been popping in Western capitals , as China has taken a hard line against internal dissent , proven unhelpful in efforts to tackle both climate change and Iran 's growing nuclear threat , manipulated its currency and launched cyber- attacks on Western computer networks . China , muscling its way to global prominence , is not quite the partner the West had been cultivating . Striking , then , that in Japan the bubble of optimism , among the country 's new leaders , is only inflating . 
 Soon after the Democratic Party of Japan ( DPJ ) swept into office nearly five months ago , Yukio Hatoyama , unveiled a vision for an East Asian Community ( EAC ) . For all that it was dreamy and disjointed , it had at its heart a rapprochement between Japan and China leading towards regional integration . Asia , Yukio Hatoyama reaffirmed , was Japan 's "" basic sphere of being "" . As for integration , fraternity was to be the glue . 
 Then late last year the DPJ 's secretary - general , Ichiro Ozawa , travelled to Beijing at the head of a 639 - strong mission , including 143 parliamentarians with whom a beaming President Hu Jintao took the trouble to be photographed , each in turn . Mr Hu does n't smile like that for Westerners . Back in Tokyo , Yukio Hatoyama horrified sticklers for imperial protocol by insisting that Mr Hu 's heir - apparent , Xi Jinping , pay an impromptu call on Emperor Akihito . Now rumours suggest Yukio Hatoyama may make a visit of remorse , the first by a Japanese prime minister , to Nanjing , site of a massacre by Japanese forces in 1937 . In return ( and at less political cost ) , Mr Hu may pay respects to the nuclear victims of Hiroshima . Japan under the DPJ seems to get on better with China than it does with its ally and security guarantor , the United States . Relations with the United States are strained over the relocation of a military base for American marines on Okinawa , leading to worries over the future of the two countries ' alliance , keystone to security in the western Pacific . 
 Economic logic argues for closer ties with China , which has already overtaken America as Japan 's biggest trading partner , and is about to overtake Japan 's economy to become the world 's second - biggest . After not one but arguably two "" lost decades "" , an ageing population can not drive demand in Japan . It must hitch itself to the Chinese juggernaut . A strategic vision , too , lurks somewhere in the idea of an EAC . Yukio Hatoyama has committed Japan to cutting greenhouse - gas emissions by a quarter by 2020 . Yukio Hatoyama thinks Japan can lead Asia towards a low - carbon future . 
 But contradictions lurk too . The idea makes a nod to China 's rise . Yet it assumes Japan 's rightful lead in proposing a new regional architecture , while impressing Japan 's technological prowess on China . The impulse is deeper - seated than Yukio Hatoyama might admit . The story of modern Japan is of the use of Western arms and technology to overturn China 's centuries - old regional dominance .

WHEN the Democratic Party of Japan (DPJ) swept a mildewed 55-year-old regime from power last year, nowhere epitomised the sense of energy and enthusiasm better than Nagasaki in south-western Japan. There, a bob-haired 28-year-old drove from office a grizzly 68-year-old, known as ""the Bear"", who had won nine consecutive elections for the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP). Less than six months later, an electoral defeat in the same city has shown how quickly Yukio Hatoyama's government has dimmed those hopes. He needs to act boldly and decisively to stop his administration sinking into the very swamp of financial scandal and policy paralysis that it was elected to drain. And that requires him to rid himself of Ichiro Ozawa, the DPJ's secretary-general, electoral wizard--and, now, its biggest handicap.
This week's defeat of the DPJ's candidate for governor of Nagasaki was an indictment of Mr Hatoyama and of Mr Ozawa, both of whom have been immersed in financial scandals. The setback was compounded by the loss of a mayoral election in a quarter of Tokyo where Mr Ozawa had stooped to campaign. ""My lack of virtue is to blame,"" Mr Ozawa said afterwards, in the sort of half-baked apology that Japan has heard so often lately--not least from the boss of Toyota, the fault-prone carmaker that has added to the national malaise.
In politics grovelling is no longer enough. As Nagasaki shows, the Japanese have learned to exact summary justice at the ballot-box. If Mr Hatoyama does not make greater amends for his own and Mr Ozawa's follies, the DPJ could well pay for it in upper-house elections this July. That would leave the party's two maverick coalition partners in a strong position, which would not only damage the DPJ, but also bring further division and disillusionment to a deflation-sapped country that is crying out for good leadership.
Were this not Japan, Mr Hatoyama might have stepped down by now. To plead ignorance of the {Yen}15m ($167,000) a month with which his heiress mother had for years topped up his campaign funds looks, at best, clueless. Worse, it led to tax evasion, deliberate or not, and the indictment of a former aide. His record in power has not helped, and opinion polls suggest his popularity has collapsed. His government has squabbled with America over a marine base, and internally over fiscal stimulus and the budget. In all these fights Mr Hatoyama has come across as quirky rather than authoritative. At least prosecutors have not pressed charges over the funding scandal. Japan has endured four prime ministers between 2007 and 2009; another truncated premiership is a wearying prospect.
Mr Hatoyama's minimum act of contrition should be ensuring that Mr Ozawa steps down as the DPJ's secretary-general. Prosecutors may have found nothing to pin on Mr Ozawa, but three current or former aides have been indicted for the misuse of political funds, and the influence he exerts over Mr Hatoyama and the ruling party is unhealthy.
Mr Ozawa may have helped win the DPJ's thumping majority in last August's lower-house contest. But since then, he has thrown his weight around over cabinet appointments, budgetary matters and affairs of state (he recently demanded to meet Barack Obama on a forthcoming visit to Washington). His swagger risks dividing the party, and he has become an electoral liability. He is probably shrewd enough to realise this; most opinion polls indicate he should go. But the longer he takes, the more disenchanted voters are likely to become. The Seven Samurai to the rescue?
Mr Hatoyama will have to find salvation elsewhere in his party--and thankfully there is some hope of this. Some ministers are learning quickly on the job. For instance, Naoto Kan, the new finance minister, has called for debate on raising the consumption tax. That is no vote-winner, but it is vital for sorting out Japan's precarious public finances. Other cabinet members distant from Mr Ozawa--some call them the ""Seven Samurai""--appear refreshingly eager to get on with making policy, rather than playing politics. 
Mr Hatoyama should take a bold gamble and turn to these people to revive his party's chances in July. Even if he jettisons Mr Ozawa, the chances are that he will rely on the man's Svengali-like influence from behind the scenes. For the good of Japan he should not. He needs to show that his party can coalesce around principles and policies, not just power. Rarely in the past half-century has Japan managed that. Mr Hatoyama has an historic opportunity to try. If he cannot take it, he too should think about going.","Yukio Hatoyama's should jettison Yukio Hatoyama's Svengali , Ichiro Ozawa

YOSUKE KONDO, 44, is one of those Young Turks in Japan's five-month-old government who took office eager to rein in Tokyo's illustriously educated cadre of senior civil servants. What distinguishes Mr Kondo, however, is that he seems poised to succeed in this goal. So far the rest of the government has seemed more inclined to work with the bureaucracy than against it.
For Mr Kondo's first target, he aimed high. He took on a man he refers to as ""the Last Samurai"", Kazuhiko Takeshima. Mr Takeshima is the epitome of the well-rounded establishment figure. An economics graduate from the prestigious University of Tokyo, he has headed the tax agency and since 2002 has run Japan's Fair Trade Commission. Mr Takeshima has made a good name for himself as a trustbuster. But for years he has resisted efforts to allow firms to appeal in court against punishments for antitrust violations. In effect, the commission acts as prosecutor and judge. As Mr Kondo notes wryly: ""It's an antitrust authority, but it keeps all the authority to itself.""
Within a few months, Mr Kondo had won cabinet support for changing the antitrust law and curbing Mr Takeshima's power. He hopes an amended law will be approved in the current session of the Diet, or parliament. This would make it one of the rare cases where the ruling Democratic Party of Japan (DPJ) has fulfilled its popular manifesto pledge to bring powerful elements of the bureaucracy to heel. As a fringe benefit for the DPJ, which tends to back Japan's trade unions, it also wins the party friends in business.
Nonetheless, Mr Kondo, a former business journalist who once wrote a book on bureaucrats, has realised how valuable his own mandarins can be. As a deputy minister in the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI), he has six policy areas to oversee, which range from global warming to the troubles of Toyota, the carmaker. In addition, he helped draw up the government's ten-year economic-growth strategy, released in December. 
He says his workload (from 7am to 11pm, he groans) is made heavier by the shortage of DPJ politicians appointed to government posts: atop a civil service of 290,000, there are just 63 DPJ officials in central-government positions. It is so easy to get bogged down in day-to-day administrative work that there is little time for strategic policymaking. This is especially true when the Diet is sitting; government officials have to attend every day.
Mr Kondo's experience will resonate in other corners of Kasumigaseki, Japan's Whitehall in central Tokyo that is the seat of the Japanese bureaucracy and whose name literally describes how many Japanese think of it--a Fortress of Fog. 
The DPJ came to power in September promising to break the disreputable triangle linking the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP), the bureaucracy and big business. This triangle helped keep the LDP in power for almost 55 years. In its crassest form, in the booming 1980s, the model plumbed the depths of corruption and bad governance. Business lobbied for contracts and support by pouring money into the party's coffers and the mandarins' pockets. The cash won the party elections and feathered the bureaucrats' nests. With the LDP's blessing, the mandarins made policy, to be rubber-stamped by the cabinet. Hence, the civil service wielded enormous power. However, it also squandered much of the prestige it had enjoyed for upholding a spirit of public service that dated all the way back to the glory days of the samurai era in the 17th-19th centuries.
The DPJ's pledge on taking office was to make policy decisions itself and ensure bureaucrats acted on those. In policymaking ministries such as METI, the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, civil servants say that by and large the transition has occurred smoothly and information has flowed easily between elected and non-elected officials.
Things are different, however, in parts of government closely associated with the LDP's former largesse, such as the agriculture, transport, and construction ministries. When Seiji Maehara, the transport minister, forced Japan Airlines (JAL), the national flag-carrier, into a court-administered bankruptcy, he reportedly had to flout the wishes of his senior civil servants. He has also confounded them with his attempts to rethink the loss-making airport system. Japan has a staggering 97 airports, some planned on the basis of fanciful traffic assumptions made by bureaucrats who wanted a retirement sinecure. They got their golden parachute, or amakudari (descent from heaven). JAL, forced to fly to their white elephants, got deeper into debt.
As Japan heads towards upper-house elections in July, some expect the DPJ to make a more public spectacle of bureaucrat-bashing. Support for the government has tumbled because of financial scandals surrounding Yukio Hatoyama, the prime minister, and Ichiro Ozawa, the DPJ's secretary-general. A candidate backed by the party suffered a stinging defeat in an election for governor of the southwestern prefecture of Nagasaki on February 21st. On the same day it lost heavily in a mayoral election in the Tokyo district of Machida City, home to many salaried workers who were considered a mainstay of DPJ support in last August's general election. I'm a bureaucrat, get me outta here
Administrative reform may not sound like a vote-winner ahead of this summer's elections. But one of the DPJ's few triumphs in its first months in office was to do so in a way that suited Japanese tastes--as television drama. According to opinion polls, the public delighted in the spectacle last November of DPJ officials hauling civil servants into a Tokyo gym to justify, under the glare of TV spotlights, their requests for budget allocations.
Earlier this month Mr Hatoyama appointed Yukio Edano, who helped lead these waste-busting efforts, as his new administrative-reform chief. He will shortly lead a similarly high-profile drive to tackle excessive spending in state-owned firms, another bureaucratic bunker. What is more, Mr Edano is a well-known critic of Mr Ozawa, the scandal-scarred secretary-general. The higher his profile, the more it may help offset the electoral liability that Mr Ozawa has become for the DPJ. 
But to solve Japan's most pressing problems, such as debt and deflation, political reality-TV is not enough. It needs joined- up policymaking, and Japan's bureaucrats and politicians are both still hopelessly short on remedies. The finance ministry blames the Bank of Japan for failing to tackle deflation. The central bank blames lax fiscal policy for the country's debt.
As one frustrated civil servant puts it, the DPJ has yet to find a way to outsource most of the ""busy work"" to bureaucrats, so it can focus on such big-picture issues. ""After all, bureaucrats now have plenty more time on their hands,"" he says. The DPJ may finally have seized power. For Japan's sake, it now has to learn the delicate art of delegation.","The DPJ is finding that it needs to befriend its bureaucrats , as well as bash them

BY RIGHTS, giving long-term South Korean residents in Japan the right to vote in local elections should be uncontroversial. They pay taxes, speak Japanese, and come from families that have lived in Japan for decades. Most were dragged here to work under the colonial cosh before and during the second world war. 
A limited move to enfranchise them came from the very top of the ruling Democratic Party of Japan (DPJ). It swept to power last September promising to end prejudices built up under the ousted Liberal Democrats. Yukio Hatoyama, the prime minister, backs it. The DPJ's secretary-general and puppeteer-at-large, Ichiro Ozawa, even assured Lee Myung-bak, South Korea's president, that he would soon push it through the Diet, or parliament. 
Yet the legislative momentum has stalled, even within the ruling party. Yoshio Maki, a DPJ lawmaker who opposes granting South Korea's ""special residents"" local voting rights, believes it is a non-starter. He says Mr Hatoyama and Mr Ozawa may even have crystallised opposition to it by making it seem inevitable. Since the DPJ came to power, eight of the 34 prefectures that originally supported the move have changed their minds. The Liberal Democrats have hardened their opposition. And one of Mr Hatoyama's coalition partners, the People's New Party, has threatened to quit the government if a suffrage bill goes to the diet. 
Mr Maki argues that the bill is popular neither among his constituents nor among the Koreans he knows. He believes they should become full citizens instead, in which case they would be granted full suffrage. And he insists there is no xenophobia. But the debate does suggest Japanese people still have plenty of misgivings about their neighbours from Korea and China. To be fair, this mistrust is heartily reciprocated. At 469,000, the Koreans are the biggest group of foreign permanent residents in Japan (though Chinese visitors are more numerous). The government makes Koreans born in Japan, who may never have been to the peninsula, choose between North and South Korean nationalities. ""Northerners"" would be excluded from any suffrage bill because their nuclear-armed country has no diplomatic ties with Japan. Having mixed feelings about Japan, and strong family ties in Korea, neither northerners nor southerners are keen to give up their original nationality, and become full Japanese citizens. Nor are most Chinese people, whose numbers in Japan have grown to about 1m, making them the largest ethnic minority. 
Suspicion among all three historical enemies dates back centuries. In 2005 a United Nations special rapporteur on human rights expressed concerns that racism in Japan against the two other groups was deep and profound. Yoichi Funabashi, editor-in-chief of the Asahi Shimbun, a national newspaper, who supports giving Koreans suffrage rights, says the biggest fear among Japanese may not be the Koreans. He says many in the DPJ are willing to give them the vote, but fear that if they did, Chinese Japanese would want to follow suit. 
Conservative elements of the Japanese press do not share Mr Funabashi's temperate views, and it is relatively easy for them to whip up fury among ultranationalists. Last October a young man broke into the DPJ's Tokyo headquarters and reportedly vented his frustration over the issue by smashing the prime minister's old computer beyond repair. Anti-Korean and anti-Chinese hatred is increasingly surfacing on the internet, too, and those countries give as good as they get. This week, for example, a cyber-skirmish erupted between South Korean and Japanese internet-users after a slight to Kim Yu-na, a South Korean figure- skater who trumped Japan's Mao Asada to win gold at the Vancouver Olympics. 
The DPJ's handling of its internal critics over the voting-rights bill is a big test of Mr Hatoyama's courage and political principle. It may show just how far he has to go before the sea of ""yuai"" (fraternity) that he hopes will extend across East Asia becomes more than just a dreamy slogan.","The DPJ stumbles in its efforts to grant foreigners the vote 
 BY RIGHTS , giving long - term South Korean residents in Japan the right to vote in local elections should be uncontroversial . They pay taxes , speak Japanese , and come from families that have lived in Japan for decades . Most were dragged here to work under the colonial cosh before and during the second world war .

AS ONE of 15 deputy secretaries-general in the ruling Democratic Party of Japan (DPJ), Yukio Ubukata may often have found it hard to make his voice heard. Not in the past week. With his disarmingly unaffected manner, the veteran member of parliament has hit the airwaves denouncing what he calls a dangerous concentration of power and money in the hands of his boss, Ichiro Ozawa.
He knew it was a strategy with a high risk of self-immolation. Mr Ozawa is the DPJ's secretary-general. As the architect of its landslide election victory last August, he is widely regarded as the most powerful politician in Japan. Even Yukio Hatoyama, the prime minister, yields before him.
What is more, Mr Ubukata complains, Mr Ozawa controls all the DPJ's funds and allocates them to his most loyal supporters. He selects which candidates the party will endorse to run for it during elections. Such influence makes it very hard for fellow party members to lend public support to any revolt against him. ""Ozawa-san's way of handling politics is to give money only to people who share his opinion. That is what is distorting democracy within the party. Because of that, no one can stand up to him. That is the source of his power,"" Mr Ubukata says.
Such incendiary claims could easily be dismissed as the rants of a man with a grudge. But, compellingly, Mr Ubukata has continued to voice them even after Mr Ozawa and Mr Hatoyama personally intervened on March 23rd to stop the party sacking him for his insubordination.
By his account, his brief meeting with Mr Ozawa to secure his future verged on the surreal. After they had both agreed that he should stay on in his post, Mr Ubukata tried to air his grievances to his boss, notably his concerns about the increasingly authoritarian nature of his leadership. But, he says, Mr Ozawa left the room abruptly, saying he had no time to discuss such matters. 
For policy wonks, the rift has a philosophical aspect, in a country that has only just emerged from half a century of monolithic one-party rule. Since he first joined the opposition in 1993, Mr Ozawa has argued for a reformed parliamentary system in Japan, modelled on Britain's House of Commons. He believes the government and ruling party should work together under a strong prime minister, with backbenchers kept in line by a party whip. This, he believes, would end the murky consensus politics that has made decision-making in Japan so hard.
But Mr Ubukata believes such a system is a waste of the many backbenchers among the DPJ's 423 elected politicians. He wants them to help make policy in Japan, rather than sit idly on the sidelines. This, he says, is what the DPJ stood for when it promised to overhaul a corrupt, decades-old system in which policy was made by bureaucrats and rubber-stamped by elected officials. He also wants the party to craft its own policy proposals, rather than wait for orders from above.
He admits to being disappointed that his one-man crusade did not set off a broader revolt. The ""seven magistrates"" in the cabinet who are opposed to Mr Ozawa by and large kept their heads down--perhaps betting that Mr Ozawa and Mr Hatoyama will be ousted anyway this summer if the upper-house results are bad. 
That is not good enough for Mr Ubukata, who believes Mr Ozawa, embroiled in campaign-finance scandals since last year, should resign well before the upper-house elections, to give the DPJ time to rebuild its credibility. He may get his way. The rare hint of vulnerability shown by Mr Ozawa in keeping Mr Ubukata on may be a sign that the end is nearly upon him.

THE Japanese cabinet is a contentious lot. When Shizuka Kamei, the minister of financial services and postal reform, unveiled plans in March to halt the planned privatisation of Japan Post, several ministers publicly balked. The finance minister was shouted down on TV by Mr Kamei. 
On March 30th the government adopted Mr Kamei's plans nonetheless. Japan Post, which is not only a post office but also the world's biggest bank, with assets of more than {Yen}300 trillion ($3.2 trillion), will be allowed to double the amount of deposits it can take from a customer to {Yen}20m. Its life-insurance unit, which controls 40% of the market, will be permitted to raise its coverage limit to {Yen}25m from {Yen}13m. The government will retain a stake of more than one-third, giving it veto power. 
Japanese bankers grumble that increasing the maximum deposit, with its implicit guarantee, gives the postal bank a huge advantage. Japanese savers tend to shift their wealth to the post office for safety. Half of all household assets are in cash or bank deposits, which amount to more than {Yen}800 trillion. American and European officials are considering going to the World Trade Organisation over access to post offices to sell insurance, among other things. 
The policy amounts to ""renationalisation"", and throws Japan's financial markets ""back to the past"", complains Heizo Takenaka, an economist who shepherded postal privatisation in 2001-06 for the then prime minister, Junichiro Koizumi. Japan Post has long been a tool of the state. Over 80% of its funds are used to buy Japanese government bonds; it holds one-third of the {Yen}683 trillion market. This, in turn, has allowed the government to finance pork-barrel projects, diverting funds from more productive uses. It was for these reasons that Mr Koizumi outlined plans to privatise Japan Post by degrees between 2007 and 2017. His scheme included a sale of shares to the public as early as this year. That would have helped the government pare its debt (around 200% of GDP) and probably given a pleasant lift to the stockmarket. 
But as soon as Mr Kamei took office in September, he signalled a halt to privatisation. His interest was in keeping post offices open in rural areas, where they are considered the heart of the community. He also wants the postal bank to provide loans as a way to revitalise rural regions, further infuriating other Japanese banks.
The saga is a symbol of the government's reluctance to restructure the economy. After six months in power, the Democratic Party of Japan (DPJ) has shied away from many of its promised reforms, such as spending cuts. On March 24th the government passed a {Yen}92 trillion budget for the fiscal year starting in April, almost half of it financed by government debt: the decision on Japan Post will help secure continued demand for its bonds. 
The imbroglio also raises the question of who runs the country: the prime minister, Yukio Hatoyama, or Mr Kamei, the gadfly leader of a small coalition party, whose six parliamentarians give the DPJ its majority in the upper house of the Diet. The DPJ believes it needs Mr Kamei's support for upper-house elections this summer. But appeasing him only ends up making the government look hapless.","Japan Post, the world's biggest bank, is handed an unfair advantage

FOR years foreign observers gave warning that Japan's combination of economic stagnation and rising public debt was unsustainable. Over the past two decades the country has stumbled in and out of deflation, slipped down the global league tables on many social indicators and amassed the largest gross public debt-to-GDP ratio in the world (a whopping 190%). Yet government-bond yields have remained stubbornly low and living standards, by and large, are high. Visit the country and you will see no outward sign of crisis. Politicians and policymakers have bickered and schemed, but have mostly chosen to leave things as they are. 
That cannot go on much longer. The figures are getting worse. Japan urgently needs radical policies to tackle the problems, and new leaders to implement them. Triple troubles
There are three big reasons why the crisis in Japan's public finances will eventually come to a head. The first concerns government bonds. The state has for years relied on domestic savers to buy them. But as Japan's people age and run down their savings, they will have less money to invest in government bonds. An IMF paper calculates that even if the savings rate remains close to where it is now, gross debt may exceed gross household assets by 2015. Japan might then have to rely on foreigners to finance its debt, and they will want much higher returns. That will, at the very least, provide an acute reality check. Goldman Sachs says some foreign investors are already positioning themselves for a ""meltdown"".
The second, more immediate problem is deflation. Falling prices may have helped the government by providing its bondholders with invisible gains, but in other ways deflation is a menace. It pushes the debt-to-GDP ratio inexorably higher. As expectations of deflation become entrenched--35% of Japanese expect prices to be the same or lower in five years' time--they will continue to depress consumption. 
Third, despite the recent pick-up in global economic activity, Japan cannot count on foreign demand being strong enough for it to sustain export-led growth, as it did in the past decade. Without a stronger domestic economy, growth will not generate enough tax revenue to reduce the debt. One ominous sign is that in the 2010 budget implemented on April 1st, borrowing, at {Yen}44 trillion ($468 billion), is for the first time forecast to exceed tax revenues, at {Yen}37 trillion.
Japan's efforts to tackle these problems have resembled a big whimper (
). What is needed is a big bang. That means structural reforms to raise productivity, fiscal reforms to boost growth and a strong monetary stimulus, all at once, to shock the economy back to life. These could range from an overhaul of the tax code to deregulation of farming and the opening up of protected areas of the economy, such as transport and energy, to foreign competition. A sensible short-term aim for the government would be robust nominal GDP growth. That would help stop the debt-to-GDP ratio rising, and would also ensure that the authorities did not prematurely choke off a recovery because of concerns about inflation.
But all this assumes that policymakers want to be bold. The current crop is anything but. Last September, when almost 55 years of one-party rule came to an end, there were faint hopes that the Democratic Party of Japan (DPj) might take a fresh approach. It has not done so. Yukio Hatoyama, the prime minister, and his most influential backer, Ichiro Ozawa, have since been caught up in election-funding scandals that have shredded the government's credibility. They are clinging to their jobs, more concerned with their own futures than that of the DPj, or indeed Japan. 
Enlightened economic policymaking suffers most. Mr Hatoyama prevaricates over fiscal reform, arguing that Japan should wait until the next general election in 2013 before shaking up the tax system. He is wrong. Japan urgently needs cuts in business taxes, perhaps, as well as a higher spending tax. The ousted Liberal Democrats are just as out of touch (
). When a group of supposed reformers left the splintering party this week to set up a new outfit, it could have grabbed the fiscally conservative, business friendly centre. Instead it moved to the right, as if anti-immigrant nationalism were the tonic Japan needs. 
It is time for more fiscally astute members of Mr Hatoyama's government to set the agenda. The main opposition, too, needs regime change. Japan's old guard worries that radical steps will precipitate an economic crisis, and so prefers the status quo. It does not realise how inherently dangerous the status quo is.","To prevent a looming economic disaster , Yukio Hatoyama urgently needs radical change

THE survival instincts of Japan's Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) have long been extraordinary. Born early in the cold war, it was still clinging to power almost 20 years after the fall of the Berlin Wall. Though neither particularly liberal nor especially democratic, nor even (by Western standards) much like a real party, the LDP still once hoped to rule Japan for ""half an eternity"". Yet this week it lurched closer to extinction after senior figures walked out to form a new political group.
Compared with the LDP's overwhelming electoral defeat last year, the departure of Kaoru Yosano, a 71-year-old former finance minister, and at least two other party veterans might be an historical footnote. But it reflects a growing fragmentation of Japan's political landscape in advance of upper-house elections in July. This poses a threat not just to the LDP but to the ruling Democratic Party of Japan (DPJ).
The Stand Up, Japan party--to be formed by Mr Yosano, and another former LDP minister, Takeo Hiranuma--is unlikely to represent a progressive force. Mr Yosano is a fiscal conservative, Mr Hiranuma a hard-line right-winger. The party appears to have the blessing of some of the Jurassic elements of Japan's establishment, such as Shintaro Ishihara, governor of Tokyo, and Tsuneo Watanabe, 84-year-old head of the Yomiuri Shimbun newspaper. 
Its formation, however, comes at a moment when, for the first time, opinion polls show that more than half of voters reject the dpj as well as the ldp. That could benefit Japan's array of upstarts--and one of them in particular, the pro-free-market Your Party, which is edging up in the opinion polls. By setting up to the right of others, Stand Up, Japan may be hoping to draw right-wingers away from both main parties. For the DPJ government that is troubling because its own poll support has slumped as a result of indecisiveness and funding scandals involving Yukio Hatoyama, the prime minister, and Ichiro Ozawa, the party's influential secretary-general. Until recently, the party's only consolation was that its rival, the LDP, was even less popular. 
Within the DPJ, despair at Messrs Hatoyama and Ozawa is growing. On April 7th Kozo Watanabe, an influential DPJ rebel, went so far as to suggest that Mr Hatoyama's cabinet should resign en masse if it fails by next month to resolve a fractious issue concerning the relocation of an American marine base in Okinawa, an island in southern Japan.
A day earlier, Yosuke Kondo, a deputy minister in Mr Hatoyama's government, said that 80% of the DPJ think Mr Ozawa should leave his post, and that kicking him out would be a good way for Mr Hatoyama to show leadership. However, he acknowledged there was a risk that a disgruntled Mr Ozawa could team up with Mr Yosano and take some of the party with him. He said Naoto Kan, the finance minister, had recently warned party members of the dangers of turning Mr Ozawa into an opponent. ""You have to keep him in the birdcage,"" as Mr Kan supposedly put it.
The DPJ is traumatised by fear of internal strife. The previous time the LDP lost power in 1993, the government that took over--which includes many of today's DPJ stalwarts--promptly tore itself apart through internal wrangling, much of it orchestrated by Mr Ozawa. The LDP was back in charge 11 months later.
What is more, before it took power the DPJ lambasted the LDP for changing a string of prime ministers without holding a general election. ""Hardly anyone in the party wants to remove Hatoyama-san from the leadership before he finishes his four-year term,"" Mr Kondo says. A revolving door of prime ministers, ""damages people's trust."" 
If the polls are right, however, trust is dwindling anyway. Unless the party can restore its lustre before the upper-house elections, say political analysts, the DPJ may be forced to rely on scrappy coalition partners.
If it does badly in those elections, it may find it easier to jettison Mr Ozawa, as the architect of the poor performance, and perhaps get rid of Mr Hatoyama, too. But as Japanese politics fragment, the party may no longer be able to count on an anti-LDP vote. The most powerful message from last August's election was not of people's loyalty to the DPJ, though it won overwhelmingly. It was that voters, after five decades of one-party rule, suddenly grasped that they have the power to change politics. The DPJ is now realising, to its alarm, that that change cuts both ways.","Party divisions suggest Japan 's political transformation has a long way to go 
 THE survival instincts of Japan 's Liberal Democratic Party ( LDP ) have long been extraordinary . Born early in the cold war , it was still clinging to power almost 20 years after the fall of the Berlin Wall . Though neither particularly liberal nor especially democratic , nor even ( by Western standards ) much like a real party , the LDP still once hoped to rule Japan for "" half an eternity "" . Yet this week it lurched closer to extinction after senior figures walked out to form a new political group . 
 Compared with the LDP 's overwhelming electoral defeat last year , the departure of Kaoru Yosano , a 71 - year - old former finance minister , and at least two other party veterans might be an historical footnote . But it reflects a growing fragmentation of Japan 's political landscape in advance of upper - house elections in July . This poses a threat not just to the LDP but to the ruling Democratic Party of Japan ( DPJ ) . 
 The Stand Up , Japan party -- to be formed by Mr Yosano , and Yukio Hatoyama -- is unlikely to represent a progressive force . Mr Yosano is a fiscal conservative , Yukio Hatoyama a hard - line right - winger . The party appears to have the blessing of some of the Jurassic elements of Japan 's establishment , such as Shintaro Ishihara , governor of Tokyo , and Tsuneo Watanabe , 84 - year - old head of the Yomiuri Shimbun newspaper . 
 Its formation , however , comes at a moment when , for the first time , opinion polls show that more than half of voters reject the dpj as well as the ldp . That could benefit Japan 's array of upstarts -- and one of them in particular , the pro - free - market Your Party , which is edging up in the opinion polls . By setting up to the right of others , Stand Up , Japan may be hoping to draw right - wingers away from both main parties . For the DPJ government that is troubling because its own poll support has slumped as a result of indecisiveness and funding scandals involving Yukio Hatoyama , the prime minister , and Ichiro Ozawa , the party 's influential secretary - general .

IF CHINA is the workshop of the world, Japan is the pristine, state-of-the-art laboratory in its backyard. You can see that by the sort of products shipped through the East China Sea in ever-greater quantities from Japan ever since China led a recovery in world trade last year. Forget the digital cameras and other high-tech gadgets. Japanese exports to China are reviving mainly on the back of products that seem to have all the sex appeal of gravel: plastic materials (up 105%, year on year, in January and February), non-metallic mineral goods (up 113%), construction machines (up 152%), textile machines (up 171%), vehicle parts (up 144%) and scientific instruments (up 133%).
Despite appearances, these are all high-tech products or high-value industrial ingredients that feed into a supply chain that snakes through the factories of East Asia to the rest of the world. With public money in China pushing growth there to a brisk canter, and inventories all over the world being restocked, it was only a matter of time before Japan's exporters began to benefit.
The strength of the recovery has surprised many economists. Japan was one of the hardest-hit countries during the global financial crisis. The collapse in exports helped put a nail in the coffin of the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP), which had ruled Japan for most of the past 55 years, partly on the strength of its ties with Japan's globe-trotting corporate giants. It was swept from power last September by the Democratic Party of Japan (DPJ), which promised to end the economy's dependence on fickle exports and promote a more balanced economy.
Fickleness cuts both ways, however. Japan's recession hit bottom in the first three months of 2009. JPMorgan calculates that over the subsequent nine months the export revival led to annualised growth of 3.1%, outstripping both America and the euro zone. Corporate profits enjoyed their biggest surge on record, albeit from very depressed levels. Unemployment has edged downwards and in January this year monthly wages crept higher compared with a year earlier for the first time in more than 18 months. JPMorgan recently upgraded its forecast for first-quarter GDP growth from 1.8% to 3.5%.
Last year's rebound in GDP, JPMorgan notes, was only a quarter of what Japan lost in the first 12 months of the crisis, so it still has a long way to go. Unless growth in global demand is sustained, it remains heavily reliant on pump-priming, both in China and at home. The recovery is likely to be given an extra fillip this year by the 2010 budget, passed on March 24th, which includes handouts to families with children under 16. In principle, spurring domestic consumption by any means available is the right thing for the seven-month-old government to do, given the fragility of the rebound. But given Japan's precarious public finances, a bigger question is: can the recovery be sustained?
The answer, disappointingly, is not for very long. That is because the cyclical upturn is unlikely to do any more than paper over Japan's deep-seated problems. These include deflation, huge public debt, ugly demographics and a glaring lack of decisiveness among policymakers about how to deal with them. Unless things change radically, these problems seem destined to sap nominal growth for years to come, with possibly disastrous consequences. Deeply depressing
To start with, Japan's economy continues to operate far below capacity. The output gap stands at 7%, three times bigger than it has been at any time since Japan's asset-price bubble burst 20 years ago, according to Richard Katz of the Oriental Economist, a newsletter. The gap between actual GDP and potential GDP (when the economy is at full throttle) correlates well with deflation, he argues (see chart 1 on next page). That suggests consumer prices have further to fall. In its latest estimate the Bank of Japan (BoJ), the credibility of which should rest on ending deflation, predicted that consumer prices would continue to fall until March 2012.
Falling prices mean that nominal GDP, which last year hit its lowest level since 1991, is likely to remain in the deep freeze. That will add to pressure on the public purse: in the 2010 budget, borrowing, at {Yen}44 trillion ($468 billion), is for the first time forecast to exceed tax revenues, at {Yen}37 trillion. It also means the gross debt-to-GDP ratio, already the highest in the rich world at 190%, will continue to rise.
Some argue that this combination of deflation-sapped growth and high debt makes Japan next in line for a Greek-style debt crisis. In a report last month, Goldman Sachs said some foreign investors were positioning themselves for a ""meltdown"". They were buying options to prepare for two related events: a sharp rise in long-term interest rates because of an erosion in debt sustainability, and a slump in the yen caused by capital flight from Japan.
One senior bureaucrat in the finance ministry returned from a G7 meeting in Canada in February, his ears ringing with worries about Greece--and, by extension, Japan. But he appeared to find it more wearying than alarming. ""For years we have been hearing warnings that Japanese-government bonds are going to collapse. It's like the doomsday view of the dollar,"" he moaned. Pointing to a trading screen on the wall where ten-year Japanese bond yields were yielding a meagre 1.4%, he noted that the market was still holding firm (in Greece, yields were about 7% at the time). He believes that Japan still has plenty of room to avoid a fiscal implosion.
In the short term, there are grounds for sharing his confidence. In many sovereign-debt crises, the trigger is not the level of debt, but the government's inability to finance it. In a recent IMF working paper*, Kiichi Tokuoka notes that in recent years there has been scant linkage between Japanese government-bond yields and the size of Japan's debt and deficits. Indeed, when net debt was less than 20% of GDP in the early 1990s, ten-year bonds yielded 7%. As the debt has soared, yields have moved in the opposite direction (see chart 2).
There are many Japan-specific reasons for this, he argues. The Japanese have a large, albeit now scarcely growing, store of savings that have helped finance the build-up of debt. At the end of 2008 domestic investors held 94% of Japanese government bonds, perhaps reflecting the risk-averse nature of Japanese society. More than half of the country's {Yen}1,400 trillion of financial assets is held in cash and deposits (in America the figure is 14%), and a large part of these are invested in Japanese government bonds via the banking system. Big public institutions such as the Japan Post Bank hold lots of government bonds. So do Japanese firms, many of which have large financial surpluses after a long period of post-bubble deleveraging.
There may be other factors at play, too. Even with nominal interest rates so low, deflation has given investors a pretty good risk-adjusted return. Why diversify? Other assets, such as land and shares, remain at paltry levels compared with their bubble-era peaks. Investing abroad has been hobbled by the yen's strength. Japanese government bonds, by contrast, have enjoyed one of the biggest bull runs in history. Some even suggest, with a conspiratorial wink, that one reason the authorities have done so little to tackle deflation is that they fear the consequences in the bond market if consumer prices were to accelerate. Crisis? What crisis?
Paradoxically, however, the belief that there is no imminent crisis brewing may be Japan's biggest problem. Without it, there may be nothing to force Japan's policymakers out of a deep paralysis. The scale of the institutional lethargy in Japan is at times breathtaking. Everyone, it seems, puts the blame for deflation and rising debt elsewhere.
Take deflation, for instance. By any reckoning it has had a corrosive effect on consumption, debt and investment in the past decade. And expectations of further deflation are entrenched: more than 35% of people expect prices to be flat or lower in five years' time. The finance ministry, led by Naoto Kan, a newish finance minister, argues with increasing stridency that it is necessary for the BoJ to root out deflation, so that Japan can once again resume nominal GDP growth. Yukio Hatoyama, the prime minister, has collared Masaaki Shirakawa, the BoJ's governor, on the issue.
Yet because the annual decline in consumer prices has been only moderate-- they have never fallen by more than 1.4%, in contrast with the rapidly plunging prices of America's Depression in the 1930s--the central bank tends to view deflation as insidious, rather than cataclysmic. As one insider rather nonchalantly puts it, it is a symptom of bigger underlying problems, rather than the problem itself.
The bank thinks the real problems are low productivity growth in Japan, which keeps wages low and suppresses demand for goods and services, and high public debt. In that sense, bizarrely for a central bank, it does not appear to believe that deflation is a monetary problem. Its own earlier experience of monetary stimulus since 1995, when it more than doubled the monetary base with little discernible effect on nominal growth, has left it unimpressed. As a result, it injected liquidity only half-heartedly into the system during the global financial crisis, putting it at odds with central banks in other rich countries.
The BoJ's resistance to acting more forcefully may be rooted in its own analysis of its earlier experience. It also seems to be haunted by the potential consequences for its credibility if it acts and fails. That position might be understandable if it were a clearly stated policy. But the bank seems to want it both ways. After much government pressure, in March it said it would extend its emergency supply of three-month loans to the banking system by {Yen}10 trillion. But far from being seen as a principled move to jump-start lending, this was perceived as a weak attempt by the bank to get the government off its back--and the BoJ's credibility took a further knock.
When it comes to public debt, the finance ministry's ostrich-like argument that there is little it can do about it until the BoJ deals with deflation is just as frustrating. It, too, appears to think that things are not as bad as the outside world believes. As one central banker ruefully puts it: ""Japan is not faced with an imminent debt crisis. But that is a mixed blessing.""
The torpor dates back years. The finance ministry is haunted by its premature attempt to raise consumption taxes before a recovery was fully under way in 1997. Another attempt to overhaul spending and taxation was launched in 2006, not long before the bursting of the global credit bubble brought it to a halt. According to the OECD, under previous LDP governments, much of the emphasis on improving public finances was focused on spending cuts rather than tax increases. Taxation as a share of GDP remains among the lowest in the OECD. But the tax system is hardly conducive to growth, with some of the highest corporate-tax rates and lowest consumption-tax rates in the rich world. To bureaucrats in the finance ministry, this suggests there is plenty of fiscal flexibility in Japan to deal with the debt problem. The trouble is they have never succeeded at tax reform.
Into this policy vacuum came the new DPJ government last year, with Mr Hatoyama vowing that he would not consider raising the consumption tax until the next elections in 2013. Greece's fiscal mess may have knocked a greater sense of urgency into his administration. After his first G7 meeting in February, Mr Kan, the newly appointed finance minister, began to speak more publicly of fiscal reform.
Others have taken up his call. Yoshito Sengoku, Mr Kan's replacement as strategy minister, says that the moment borrowing exceeded tax revenues in the 2010 budget, it was clear that Japan had reached a turning point. ""I don't think the situation will go immediately as it did in Greece. But going forward the Japanese bond market will always be under pressure and the government officials who are in charge of fiscal policies have to be ten times more cautious than before,"" he says.
He favours an increase in the consumption tax and may also support cuts in corporate tax when he announces a medium-term plan for fiscal reform in the spring. But the politics of a significant overhaul are excruciatingly complicated. After a series of political-funding scandals involving Mr Hatoyama, support for his administration has fallen sharply ahead of upper- house elections in the summer. So it is a safe bet that any talk of tax reform will be accompanied by soothing promises of higher welfare spending. We can't go on like this
At present none of the ideas being aired to deal with Japan's problems is anything like bold or concrete enough to sound convincing. And though the government may muddle through for a few years yet, ultimately the situation is unsustainable. At some point, unless radical steps are taken, Japan's government will go bust.
The IMF's Mr Tokuoka reckons that as the population ages, savings will dwindle, which could reduce inflows to the government-bond market. He calculates that even if the household savings rate remains at 2.2%, by 2015 gross public debt could exceed households' financial assets, which might make domestic funding more difficult and lead Japan to rely more on foreigners. Meanwhile, government pension funds have more flexibility to invest in other assets besides government bonds.
With interest payments at 26% of tax revenues, rising yields would come as a huge shock to Japan. Already, some economists argue that flat bond yields give only the illusion of market stability. Ryutaro Kono, chief economist of BNP Paribas in Japan, says that given the fall in Japan's potential growth rate and the drop in inflation expectations, yields should normally have plunged. ""The fact that the long-term rate has generally been flat for the last 18 months suggests the risk premium is rising on questions of the sustainability of Japan's public debt,"" he says.
What's more, rising social-security payments as the population ages are likely to put even more pressure on public financing, while the shrinking workforce will mean even slower growth and smaller tax revenues. In 1990 almost six people of working age supported each retiree. By 2025 the Japanese government expects that ratio to fall to two. At some point Japan may have no other option than a domestic default in which the older generation, who hold most of the government bonds, will see the value of their investments cut to reduce the pressure on the younger generation. Such an intergenerational transfer would come at enormous political and social cost, not least in a society with such a strong sense of communal well-being.
Economists suggest many schemes to forestall such a crisis, most of which involve the government and the BoJ producing what the Oriental Economist's Mr Katz calls a ""fiscal-monetary one-two punch"" to kick-start nominal growth. Massive and well-targeted fiscal stimulus is one option, he writes: the current ""eco-points"" subsidy scheme, which has led to a surge in purchases of energy-saving durable goods, is a good example. In return, the BoJ should commit to keeping long-term rates low by increasing its purchases of government bonds. Others favour a sharp cut in corporate tax rates to boost competitiveness.
Many observers agree that fiscal looseness is the best first step to faster nominal GDP growth. Jesper Koll, a strategist at Merrill Lynch, plausibly argues, however, that raising the consumption tax in small increments each year might encourage people to accelerate their spending plans. Whatever their prescriptions, few are optimistic. As Mr Katz puts it: ""To reject both fiscal and monetary tools is to say that Japan can only wait for the rest of the world to rescue it. That's the passive mindset that has kept Japan stagnant for two decades so far.""
One of the biggest challenges in stimulating growth is to persuade households and firms to borrow again. Richard Koo of the Nomura Research Institute calls their reluctance to do so the ""debt-rejection syndrome"". Having finally paid off their bubble-era bills, many are likely to have a visceral objection to borrowing. He thinks an investment-tax credit for firms, and a promotion of investment by homeowners in Japan's feeble housing stock, would help.
Macroeconomic medicine, though essential, will not be enough to solve Japan's problems. Structural reforms to raise the economy's efficiency will be needed too. The list of areas which need a shake-up is as long as it is familiar. The heavily mollycoddled agricultural sector needs deregulating, and services from transport to power generation need to be opened up to foreign competition. Allowing more immigrants would boost the labour force. Many of these proposals are a hard sell culturally. But if the perils of inaction were well laid out, it would not be the first time Japanese citizens have been asked to accept big sacrifices in the national interest.
The trouble is, there is little tangible sense, either among politicians or in the country at large, that a crisis is brewing. And if the economy continues its cyclical improvement, the urgency of reform may appear even less compelling. It will be even harder given people's abiding faith, Toyota's humiliating recalls notwithstanding, in the prowess of Japan's cutting-edge exporters and their growing links with China. As one businessman puts it, in a country that has been blighted by wars, fires and earthquakes throughout its history, people have grown accustomed to waiting until disaster is actually upon them before they focus on renewal.
A lot about this state of affairs--particularly the reluctance to do anything radical--is profoundly Japanese. It may mean the country is consigned to stagnation, which only makes an eventual default appear more inevitable. But the lessons from Japan are important for all countries, such as America, Britain and parts of Europe, that have suffered a big asset bust. It shows that in the aftermath of a meltdown, slow growth, low productivity, rising public debt and deflationary pressures can last a lot longer than anyone thinks--and that policymakers can make all sorts of mistakes as they try to escape them.

Its own earlier experience of monetary stimulus since 1995 , when it more than doubled the monetary base with little discernible effect on nominal growth , has left it unimpressed . As a result , it injected liquidity only half - heartedly into the system during the global financial crisis , putting it at odds with central banks in other rich countries . 
 The BoJ 's resistance to acting more forcefully may be rooted in its own analysis of its earlier experience . It also seems to be haunted by the potential consequences for its credibility if it acts and fails . That position might be understandable if it were a clearly stated policy . But the bank seems to want it both ways . After much government pressure , in March it said it would extend its emergency supply of three - month loans to the banking system by { Yen}10 trillion . But far from being seen as a principled move to jump - start lending , this was perceived as a weak attempt by the bank to get the government off its back -- and the BoJ 's credibility took a further knock . 
 When it comes to public debt , the finance ministry 's ostrich - like argument that there is little it can do about it until the BoJ deals with deflation is just as frustrating . It , too , appears to think that things are not as bad as the outside world believes . As one central banker ruefully puts it : "" Japan is not faced with an imminent debt crisis . But that is a mixed blessing . "" 
 The torpor dates back years . The finance ministry is haunted by its premature attempt to raise consumption taxes before a recovery was fully under way in 1997 . Another attempt to overhaul spending and taxation was launched in 2006 , not long before the bursting of the global credit bubble brought it to a halt . According to the OECD , under previous LDP governments , much of the emphasis on improving public finances was focused on spending cuts rather than tax increases . Taxation as a share of GDP remains among the lowest in the OECD . But the tax system is hardly conducive to growth , with some of the highest corporate - tax rates and lowest consumption - tax rates in the rich world . To bureaucrats in the finance ministry , this suggests there is plenty of fiscal flexibility in Japan to deal with the debt problem . The trouble is they have never succeeded at tax reform . 
 Into this policy vacuum came the new DPJ government last year , with Yukio Hatoyama vowing that Yukio Hatoyama would not consider raising the consumption tax until the next elections in 2013 . Greece 's fiscal mess may have knocked a greater sense of urgency into his administration . After his first G7 meeting in February , Mr Kan , the newly appointed finance minister , began to speak more publicly of fiscal reform . 
 Others have taken up his call . Yoshito Sengoku , Mr Kan 's replacement as strategy minister , says that the moment borrowing exceeded tax revenues in the 2010 budget , it was clear that Japan had reached a turning point . "" I do n't think the situation will go immediately as it did in Greece . But going forward the Japanese bond market will always be under pressure and the government officials who are in charge of fiscal policies have to be ten times more cautious than before , "" he says . 
 He favours an increase in the consumption tax and may also support cuts in corporate tax when he announces a medium - term plan for fiscal reform in the spring . But the politics of a significant overhaul are excruciatingly complicated . After a series of political - funding scandals involving Yukio Hatoyama , support for Yukio Hatoyama's administration has fallen sharply ahead of upper- house elections in the summer . So it is a safe bet that any talk of tax reform will be accompanied by soothing promises of higher welfare spending . We ca n't go on like this 
 At present none of the ideas being aired to deal with Japan 's problems is anything like bold or concrete enough to sound convincing . And though the government may muddle through for a few years yet , ultimately the situation is unsustainable . At some point , unless radical steps are taken , Japan 's government will go bust . 
 The IMF 's Mr Tokuoka reckons that as the population ages , savings will dwindle , which could reduce inflows to the government - bond market . He calculates that even if the household savings rate remains at 2.2 % , by 2015 gross public debt could exceed households ' financial assets , which might make domestic funding more difficult and lead Japan to rely more on foreigners . Meanwhile , government pension funds have more flexibility to invest in other assets besides government bonds . 
 With interest payments at 26 % of tax revenues , rising yields would come as a huge shock to Japan . Already , some economists argue that flat bond yields give only the illusion of market stability . Ryutaro Kono , chief economist of BNP Paribas in Japan , says that given the fall in Japan 's potential growth rate and the drop in inflation expectations , yields should normally have plunged . "" The fact that the long - term rate has generally been flat for the last 18 months suggests the risk premium is rising on questions of the sustainability of Japan 's public debt , "" he says . 
 What 's more , rising social - security payments as the population ages are likely to put even more pressure on public financing , while the shrinking workforce will mean even slower growth and smaller tax revenues . In 1990 almost six people of working age supported each retiree . By 2025 the Japanese government expects that ratio to fall to two . At some point Japan may have no other option than a domestic default in which the older generation , who hold most of the government bonds , will see the value of their investments cut to reduce the pressure on the younger generation . Such an intergenerational transfer would come at enormous political and social cost , not least in a society with such a strong sense of communal well - being . 
 Economists suggest many schemes to forestall such a crisis , most of which involve the government and the BoJ producing what the Oriental Economist 's Mr Katz calls a "" fiscal - monetary one - two punch "" to kick - start nominal growth . Massive and well - targeted fiscal stimulus is one option , he writes : the current "" eco - points "" subsidy scheme , which has led to a surge in purchases of energy - saving durable goods , is a good example . In return , the BoJ should commit to keeping long - term rates low by increasing its purchases of government bonds . Others favour a sharp cut in corporate tax rates to boost competitiveness . 
 Many observers agree that fiscal looseness is the best first step to faster nominal GDP growth . Jesper Koll , a strategist at Merrill Lynch , plausibly argues , however , that raising the consumption tax in small increments each year might encourage people to accelerate their spending plans . Whatever their prescriptions , few are optimistic . As Mr Katz puts it : "" To reject both fiscal and monetary tools is to say that Japan can only wait for the rest of the world to rescue it . That 's the passive mindset that has kept Japan stagnant for two decades so far . "" 
 One of the biggest challenges in stimulating growth is to persuade households and firms to borrow again . Richard Koo of the Nomura Research Institute calls their reluctance to do so the "" debt - rejection syndrome "" . Having finally paid off their bubble - era bills , many are likely to have a visceral objection to borrowing . He thinks an investment - tax credit for firms , and a promotion of investment by homeowners in Japan 's feeble housing stock , would help . 
 Macroeconomic medicine , though essential , will not be enough to solve Japan 's problems . Structural reforms to raise the economy 's efficiency will be needed too . The list of areas which need a shake - up is as long as it is familiar . The heavily mollycoddled agricultural sector needs deregulating , and services from transport to power generation need to be opened up to foreign competition . Allowing more immigrants would boost the labour force . Many of these proposals are a hard sell culturally . But if the perils of inaction were well laid out , it would not be the first time Japanese citizens have been asked to accept big sacrifices in the national interest . 
 The trouble is , there is little tangible sense , either among politicians or in the country at large , that a crisis is brewing . And if the economy continues its cyclical improvement , the urgency of reform may appear even less compelling . It will be even harder given people 's abiding faith , Toyota 's humiliating recalls notwithstanding , in the prowess of Japan 's cutting - edge exporters and their growing links with China . As one businessman puts it , in a country that has been blighted by wars , fires and earthquakes throughout its history , people have grown accustomed to waiting until disaster is actually upon them before they focus on renewal . 
 A lot about this state of affairs -- particularly the reluctance to do anything radical -- is profoundly Japanese . It may mean the country is consigned to stagnation , which only makes an eventual default appear more inevitable . But the lessons from Japan are important for all countries , such as America , Britain and parts of Europe , that have suffered a big asset bust . It shows that in the aftermath of a meltdown , slow growth , low productivity , rising public debt and deflationary pressures can last a lot longer than anyone thinks -- and that policymakers can make all sorts of mistakes as they try to escape them .

The opposition is a shambles; but since the government is its own worst enemy, who needs one?
FOR half a century Japan, dominated by the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP), was a one-party state in multiparty clothes. Last August came a seismic shift, when the general election swept away the once-mighty LDP and installed the Democratic Party of Japan (DPJ) in office. Anyone rooting for an overdue revamp of Japan's political apparatus hailed the advent of a two-party state. Competition might even produce good policy.
They were too optimistic. A black dog of a depression has settled back over the country's politics, affecting both main parties. In opposition the LDP has unravelled with impressive speed. In late April the country's favourite politician, Yoichi Masuzoe, a rare combination in the LDP of ambition and ideas, joined a stream of high-profile defectors forming new parties. He calls for refreshing change: deregulation, decentralisation and--crucially for a country with too many paws on the levers of power--a halving of the number in the Diet (parliament). 
For the moment, such groupings have not captured the public imagination. They contain too many lone wolves and grumpy old men, such as the governor of Tokyo, Shintaro Ishihara, who is responsible for the naming of one notable new party, Tachiagare Nippon!--literally, Stand Up, Japan! When Banyan once called on him, he launched into a tirade about Japanese men cowed by their womenfolk into sitting down when they pee. 
If the LDP seems at the end of the line, the bigger surprise is that it lasted so long. It was born of the cold war, free of any ideology save anti-communism. Its business was winning elections and dividing the spoils--and for decades it did that very efficiently. But once the communist threat had gone and economic growth had slowed, the LDP had lost its purpose. Younger reformists lost seats at the last election or are now walking out. The grizzled old guard are at a loss.
For the DPJ government the opposition's ineptitude has not mattered, so capable has it proved at self-destruction. For a start, both Yukio Hatoyama, prime minister since September, and the DPJ's secretary-general, Ichiro Ozawa, are under a cloud over the misuse of political funds. On April 27th a judicial panel ordered a review of a February decision not to prosecute Mr Ozawa.
Worse, the prime minister's early promise to concentrate decision-making powers in the cabinet has come to nought. Along with a flair for airy-fairy waffle, Mr Hatoyama has exhibited breathtaking indecision.
This is most visible over a 2006 plan to move Futenma, the air base on Okinawa for America's marine expeditionary force. Mr Hatoyama insisted on reopening the agreement--locals objected to building a new heliport on an unspoilt shore--while offering no reasonable alternative. Japan's relations with its American ally sank to new lows. Expectations among Okinawans (90,000 demonstrated against the move on April 25th) cannot be met. At the end of May Mr Hatoyama may propose a modified version of the original plan. But when Barack Obama in April bluntly asked him whether he had it in him to get a deal, Japanese officials were too shocked to record the question, let alone the answer.
At home a spat about roads undermines all the assurances about cabinet authority. Mr Ozawa wants both to have low tolls and taxpayer funds to go on building unnecessary roads. The transport minister, Seiji Maehara, rightly objects. The cabinet should have ruled. Instead, Mr Hatoyama has passed the matter to the Diet, where members will look out for their own districts. This recalls how the LDP used to act. It bodes ill for a country that needs to tackle rapidly worsening finances and sluggish growth.
The tensions between the DPJ's modernisers and Mr Ozawa, who undermines the cabinet from outside it, have the potential to tear the party apart. Mr Hatoyama's popularity, which once soared, plumbs abysmal depths. Japan has gone from a one- to a two-party state, and now to what? A no-party state? A splinter-party state? Is Japan cursed by being terminally ungovernable? Let's twist again like we did last summer
The question will be easier to answer, first once it is known how Mr Hatoyama and Mr Ozawa weather the immediate political squalls, and then with the results of elections to be held in July for half of the seats in the Diet's upper house. In private, the prime minister, for all his indecision, is stubborn on one point. All he wants is to stay in office for longer than another recent prime minister, Shinzo Abe. Like Mr Hatoyama, Mr Abe is the grandson of a notable LDP prime minister and, like him, was put up for the top job by a rich and domineering mother (it is not known what posture the two men adopt for urination). Mr Abe lasted all of a year. This is how low the prime minister has set the bar for himself. But Futenma may bring him down before the election.
Many DPJ reformers want Mr Ozawa to go before then too--the party's election prospects would be better. This week Mr Hatoyama backed Mr Ozawa, the real power in the DPJ, after the ruling by the prosecutors' panel. Certainly, Mr Ozawa's potential to damage the DPJ is immense. For instance, Takao Toshikawa, a political insider, suggests that Mr Ozawa could challenge and replace Mr Hatoyama, call a snap election and then step down as prime minister to run from behind the scenes the kind of ""grand coalition"", including with disaffected ex-LDPers, that he attempted once before, in effect creating a new LDP in his own mould. 
More likely, the election will force the DPJ to seek the support of smaller groups to form a governing majority. Some of the reformist groups that have splintered from the LDP might spot a chance to wield influence. But continued alliances with anti-reform groups are also possible. Either way, the horse-trading will serve only to alienate voters further from a system that is more responsive to back-room deals than to the national need.","Economist.com/blogs/banyan

YUKIO HATOYAMA, Japan's leader, does not exude political gravitas. So it was dispiritingly in-character that when he made an announcement on May 4th that could make or break his premiership, he did so on a national holiday, speaking unpersuasively to the very people most likely to disapprove of what he said.
The bombshell he dropped on his first visit as prime minister to the island of Okinawa was that he was backtracking on what has become the most sensitive promise of last year's election campaign--to move an American marine base off the island and possibly out of Japan altogether. It sounded like the change of heart that America has been waiting for for months. Yet the silence from Washington after his visit to Okinawa was ominous, speaking eloquently of an apparent lack of faith in Mr Hatoyama himself.
His explanation, as far as it went, made sense, though it took a painfully long time to reach. After long deliberation, the prime minister said, he had concluded that the security of a region with a nuclear-armed, reckless North Korea depends, in part, on having some American marines in Okinawa. But instead of seizing the opportunity to explain to Okinawans how American troops help keep the peace, he referred to the soldiers dismissively as a ""burden"" that had to be shared by Okinawans.
It was an appeal bound to fall on deaf ears among islanders who play host to half of the 50,000 American troops in Japan. It may have been doubly galling coming from a man who had rashly promised last year to tear up a treaty to relocate the Futenma air base within Okinawa, but had no Plan B to offer America. ""Liar"", ""traitor"", ""shame on you"", shouted protesters in the crowd.
Mr Hatoyama still has a little time to salvage his reputation. He has set himself a deadline of May 31st to resolve the Futenma issue fully. Yet it seems likely he will end up parroting this week's unilateral course of action, rather than reach a workable agreement among the parties involved. Reaction from Okinawan politicians to Mr Hatoyama bordered on hostile. Part of his proposal appears to involve sending some of the marines' helicopters to another island, Tokunoshima. Most islanders there also flatly oppose the idea.
So the issue remains fraught, which will cost Mr Hatoyama's Democratic Party of Japan dearly in the run-up to upper-house elections this summer. There are calls within the party for him to resign if he cannot reach a satisfactory outcome by the end of this month.
The trouble is that even if he does quit, his successor risks falling into the same Futenma trap, unless all sides learn to be more accommodating. The Obama administration may have got off to a bad start with Mr Hatoyama. It would not want to repeat the mistake if, as some now hope, he is eventually replaced.

 The bombshell Yukio Hatoyama dropped on Yukio Hatoyama's first visit as prime minister to the island of Okinawa was that Yukio Hatoyama was backtracking on what has become the most sensitive promise of last year 's election campaign -- to move an American marine base off the island and possibly out of Japan altogether .

IN MANY parts of the world, journalists would be unable to resist a good political slush-fund scandal. In Japan, information is dribbling out about a murky stash of cash kept in a black box near the prime minister's office that for decades has been used to curry political favour--even, it is said, among journalists and television commentators. Tellingly, the Japanese media are reacting to the scandal like the three wise monkeys of Nikko: see no evil, hear no evil, speak no evil.
The existence of the fund has long been known to insiders. Now, for the first time, a sitting government has admitted to its existence. In a letter to the Japanese Communist Party (JCP) on May 14th, Hirofumi Hirano, chief cabinet secretary in the government of Yukio Hatoyama, has confirmed he withdrew {Yen}360m ($3.8m) between September and March, and returned an unused portion of just {Yen}16m to the exchequer. Asked by a JCP lawmaker in parliament in March what record he had kept of the expenditure, he helpfully replied: ""It is in my mind."" 
Mr Hirano says he has no plans for the time being to disclose what the money was spent on, for fear of damaging ""the national interest"". Nor does he expect to stop dipping into the pot. He also appeared reluctant to investigate the outgoing administration of Taro Aso, which raided the fund last year just before it handed over power to Mr Hatoyama. Two days after the election, and two weeks before leaving office, it withdrew {Yen}250m.
The mainstream press has been strangely reticent on the matter. Besides a long article in the Communist-leaning RedFlag, the scandal has received just snippets of coverage in national newspapers. That may be for fear of being smeared by their own story. Last month, Hiromu Nonaka, one of Mr Hirano's predecessors as chief cabinet secretary, revealed that between 1998 and 1999 he spent up to {Yen}70m ($600,000 at the exchange rate of the time) per month from his secret little piggy bank. That included {Yen}10m for the prime minister and {Yen}10m for politicians in the then-ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP). But it also included money strewn among press commentators and members of opposition parties. Some was splurged on sending them on trips to North Korea.
The 84-year-old Mr Nonaka made the confession, he said, because he did not want to carry the secret to the grave about what he rightly referred to as taxpayers' money. But he may have been making mischief, too, for Mr Hatoyama's Democratic Party of Japan (DPJ), which drove the LDP from power last year on a platform of transparency and accountability.
Takao Toshikawa, editor of Tokyo Inside Line, a political newsletter, who once wrote a book on slush funds, says he doubts pay-offs still go to the media. But he adds that there is a rumour that some slush-fund largesse has been lavished on wining and dining residents of Okinawa, notably those who oppose the government's plan to relocate an American marine base on their island. 
Some people might shrug off such funds as part of the old Japanese tradition of gift-giving, albeit involving some rather generous presents. But for a government that has long promised to dig up the ""buried treasure"" hidden in such secret accounts to improve public finances, it is extraordinary that it, too, is taking such brazen advantage of this darkest of slush funds. Just as extraordinary, not to mention suspicious, is the impressive silence from most of the powerful mass media. More evidence, if it were needed, of the central role they play in Japan's longstanding political dysfunction.","You may get wise monkeys : the Japanese press ignores a juicy story

SINCE 2006 Japan has had no fewer than five prime ministers. Three of them lasted just a year. The feckless Yukio Hatoyama, who stepped down on June 2nd, managed a grand total of 259 days. Particularly dispiriting about Mr Hatoyama's sudden departure is that his election last August looked as if it marked the start of something new in Japanese politics after decades of rule by the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP). His government has turned out to be as incompetent, aimless and tainted by scandal as its predecessors. 
Much of the responsibility for the mess belongs with Mr Hatoyama. The man known as ""the alien"", who says the sight of a little bird last weekend gave him the idea to resign, has shown breathtaking lack of leadership. Although support for his Democratic Party of Japan (DPJ) has slumped in opinion polls and the government relied on minor parties, the most glaring liabilities have been over Mr Hatoyama's own murky financial affairs and his dithering about where to put an American military base. The question for the next prime minister, to be picked in a DPJ vote on June 4th, is whether Mr Hatoyama's failure means that Japan's nine-month experiment with two-party democracy has been a misconceived disaster.
The answer is of interest not just within Japan. Such is the recent merry-go-round of prime ministers that it is easy to assume that whoever runs the show makes no difference to the performance of the world's second-largest economy. Now Japan's prominence in Asia has so clearly been eclipsed by China, its flimsy politicians are all the easier to dismiss.
But that dangerously underestimates Japan's importance to the world and the troubles it faces. With the largest amount of debt relative to the size of its economy among the rich countries, and a stubborn deflation problem to boot, Japan has an economic time-bomb ticking beneath it. It may be able to service its debt comfortably for the time being, but the euro zone serves as a reminder that Japan needs strong leadership to stop the bomb from exploding.
What's more, stability around South and East Asia depends to a large extent on Japan's 50-year-old security alliance with America, which acts as a counterbalance against Chinese military expansion. The nine-month stand-off between Japan and America over a marine base in Okinawa, a fight which Mr Hatoyama picked himself and has now done for him, is a glaring example of how poor leadership can muddy the waters. Shogun to Japan's head
With Mr Hatoyama out of the way, it is tempting to hope that the DPJ will put its problems behind it and quickly rebuild its credibility with the electorate and Japan's friends abroad. There are two reasons for misgivings, however. The first is the role of Ichiro Ozawa, the Svengali-like figure who stood mischievously behind Mr Hatoyama. The second is the calibre of the candidates to become Japan's next prime minister.
Mr Ozawa resigned as the DPJ's secretary-general alongside Mr Hatoyama, but he, unlike his boss, has not promised to bow out of politics. Moreover, he has such influence over the party that he could continue to pull strings from behind the scenes, especially ahead of upper-house elections this summer. That would be inexcusable. Like Mr Hatoyama, Mr Ozawa has been caught up in campaign-funding scandals that have reeked as badly as they ever did under the LDP. He has meddled with good policies and failed to stop bad ones, such as the attempt to roll back the privatisation of the postal system. The ""Shadow Shogun"" represents the worst side of the old politics. If Mr Ozawa remains influential, he will only undermine any future party leader in the eyes of voters.
Whoever that leader is will have plenty to prove as it is (see
). As The Economist went to press, the most likely replacement for Mr Hatoyama was Naoto Kan, the finance minister. He has shown more financial nous than Messrs Hatoyama and Ozawa in arguing for fiscal reform in Japan. But he has kept so quiet about the DPJ's failing leadership that it is hard to imagine him putting Mr Ozawa in his place. Other potential candidates, who have stood up more firmly to Mr Ozawa, will be opposed by many in the party who are under the man's sway. And sadly, none looks like he has enough of the right stuff to restore Japan's standing in the world. Look up, Japan
For many voters, this all smacks of Japan's earlier attempt to escape the LDP's shadow, in 1993. The coalition government that replaced it--also under Mr Ozawa's spell--lasted barely 11 months. But a lot has changed since then. Today the LDP has only slightly benefited from the DPJ's woes, and is itself in danger of splintering. The legacy of two lost decades has left voters with little nostalgia for old habits. Having finally broken the mould of Japanese politics, it is almost inconceivable that they will vote the old lot back into office. 
However far-fetched it seems at this sorry juncture, Japan's leadership crisis presents a chance to progress to a new sort of politics, based more around policies than personalities. Besides its fiscal problems, Japan has an ageing population that will be a draw on the public purse. Its stock of savings is diminishing, and though it is riddled with misgivings about the presence of American troops in Japan so long after the second world war, it can hardly pay for its own defence. Factional politics has failed utterly to deal with these problems. But divisions within the political duopoly have produced splinter parties, some of which have sensible ideas for putting Japan's economy back on track. The new DPJ leadership, however badly it does in this summer's upper-house elections, should capitalise on that by forming coalitions with its ideological peers, rather than with the mavericks it has relied on so far. Getting rid of Mr Ozawa would be a sign of real change. 
There is hope therefore that things are beginning to get so bad that reform really will appear relatively soon. But the main impression at the moment is of drift. The sad fact is that the world's second biggest economy, home to companies that have changed industries around the world, is being kept out of dire trouble only by the loyalty of its own savers.","It used to be the envy of the world ; now the hope is that things have got so bad that reform is finally possible

JUST before Yukio Hatoyama stepped down as Japan's prime minister on June 2nd, he carried out what could--in an ideal world--be one of the bolder acts of his premiership. He convinced Ichiro Ozawa, secretary-general of the Democratic Party of Japan (DPJ) and a powerbroker who has held sway over Japan's mildewed politics for decades, to resign with him.
After announcing his decision, Mr Hatoyama, who is only 63, promised to retire gracefully from politics. His eyes wet with tears, he showed what appeared to be genuine contrition for letting down voters who nine months ago overwhelmingly backed his party in a general election, ending more than half a century of rule by the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP).
Not so Mr Ozawa. As The Economist went to press, there was still some doubt that his resignation would loosen his grip on the party machine. He currently commands the loyalty of at least 150 ruling-party lawmakers, by far the biggest faction in the parliament, or Diet. That would give him some influence over whomever the party picks to replace Mr Hatoyama at a gathering on June 4th, even from behind the scenes. 
The front-runner for the job has long been Naoto Kan, the finance minister and deputy prime minister (see box on next page). Before the vote he received a fillip when two possible rivals, the foreign and transport ministers, decided not to run against him. But whoever the new leader is, he--it is never a she--will have a lot on his plate. After picking a cabinet, he will have less than a fortnight before the session of the Diet ends on June 16th. That means he will have to decide whether to postpone or scrap a controversial bill to reverse the reform of the postal system. Scrapping it would anger a small coalition partner of the DPJ that is passionately opposed to privatisation. It would also alienate the politically powerful postal workers. But it would be a strong signal to financial markets that the new leader has his economic priorities right.
Then, on July 11th, come mid-term elections for the upper house. These will be another milestone for the DPJ. Months ago, gaining a majority in the upper house to add to its lower-house one was considered a safe bet. But the DPJ's financial scandals, and Mr Hatoyama's inability to decide until last month what to do about an American marine base in Okinawa, have hit the party hard, according to opinion surveys. The new leader will have his work cut out to avoid a drubbing at the polls.
What is more, he must somehow escape the curse of Okinawa. Friction with America over relocating the marine base there ultimately triggered Mr Hatoyama's downfall. The hope for Mr Kan, if he is the new leader, will be that his silence on the issue during the past nine months will absolve him of responsibility for it. He could maintain an existing agreement with America, which would mollify the administration, and hope that the anger in Okinawa is eventually forgotten by much of the electorate. The Okinawans, however, will do their best to keep their strident opposition to the base in the public eye.
Even if the DPJ's popularity is not significantly enhanced by the change of leader, a poor showing in the upper-house election could be a blessing in disguise. It would reinforce the impression that Mr Ozawa had done the party no good, and make it easier to send him packing. 
Within the Diet, some small parties are winning popularity at the expense of the flailing DPJ and the discredited LDP. Some, such as Your Party, have sensibly liberal views, and might be willing to align with the DPJ, provided Mr Ozawa were not lurking in the shadows. Mr Ozawa's resignation ""opens up the possibility of a coalition as long as [Mr] Ozawa doesn't try to run the DPJ through a surrogate,"" writes Richard Katz of the Oriental Economist, a newsletter (unrelated to The Economist).
Coalition politics can be scrappy. Mr Hatoyama's feisty partners made life tough for him over the Okinawa air base. Without a big majority, a dominant party like the DPJ can easily get bogged down in parliament. Japan could become even more directionless than it already is.
But coalitions have merits, sometimes forcing bigger parties to accommodate smaller ones to get their policies voted into law. If policies in Japan become more important than personalities, it would mark a welcome shift. Even if this new style of politics weakens big parties, that could be no bad thing, considering how chaotic recent years have been under them.","And a new generation of leaders beckons .

IN A country where only one prime minister has lasted more than three years in the past 20 (the uncharacteristicly charismatic Junichiro Koizumi), people are understandably blase about who will be the next man in the top job. This time could be different. If the leader can step out from under the shadow of Japan's last old-fashioned factional boss, the Democratic Party of Japan's Ichiro Ozawa, he could usher in a new sort of coalition politics, with the potential to be either disastrously messy or refreshingly clean.
The most likely successor has long been Naoto Kan, the 63-year-old finance minister and deputy prime minister. His pedigree would mark a change to the top in itself. Since Mr Koizumi resigned in 2006, Japan has had five prime ministers, all of whom have been either the son or grandson of a former prime minister. Of unflashy origin, the dogged Mr Kan made his own way up the political ladder, gaining prestige in the mid-1990s when, as health minister, he exposed bureaucrats who allowed the transfusion of HIV-tainted blood to haemophiliacs.
He had little macroeconomic experience before being appointed finance minister in January, but gained a reputation among the ministry's bureaucrats as a quick learner. They were thrilled that he actually listened to them. In that job, he has stood out for two reasons: his willingness to begin discussing--albeit gingerly--a rise in the consumption tax as part of a fiscal overhaul to reduce Japan's crushing debt burden; and justifiable criticism of the Bank of Japan for not doing enough to end deflation.
But he has one big flaw. While in the cabinet, he made no attempt to distance himself from the prime minister or from Mr Ozawa when they were both caught up in debilitating campaign-funding scandals that clobbered the government's popular standing. ""If Mr Kan is chosen, he may have the same problem that Mr Hatoyama faced. The public might consider him to be another puppet of Mr Ozawa,"" says Akihiko Tanaka, a professor of international politics at the University of Tokyo.

CENTRAL bankers in Western countries are getting used to the idea that part of their job is to try to raise animal spirits after a slump. In Japan, after two decades of stagnation--nominal GDP is at the same level as 1992--Japanese politicians are leaning on the Bank of Japan (BOJ) to stir the beasts in ever more inventive ways. Already, interest rates have hovered around zero for a decade, and quantitative easing has flooded the system with funds, to little avail.
This month the BOJ will unveil a radical measure for ""strengthening the foundations for economic growth"" that borders on fiscal policy. It plans to lend to private banks at the policy rate of 0.1% for one year (which is extendable), provided that the funds are used for loans or investments in certain growth sectors. The rate is considerably lower than the 12-month interbank rate. Although the loan size and industries have yet to be specified, the areas are meant to dovetail with the government's growth strategy which will be announced later this month, and is expected to include energy, the environment, space and robotics.
The BOJ's governor, Masaaki Shirakawa, admits that the initiative is not ""orthodox"" for a central bank and vows to avoid allocating resources at the microeconomic level; yet that is precisely what it is doing. The move is seen as a way to appease politicians pressing the BOJ to do more to support the economy, notably Naoto Kan, the finance minister, who is expected to ascend to the premiership following the resignation of Yukio Hatoyama. Mr Kan's pressure is particularly ironic considering that the Democratic Party of Japan swept into power last autumn denouncing the previous government's interference into the BOJ. 
The idea behind the initiative is that Japanese animal spirits are merely in hibernation, and a spurt of cash is all it takes to awaken rapacious entrepreneurs from their garages. Of course, Japanese banks are already awash in cash. Much of Japan's colossal household wealth, one of the world's biggest pools of savings, is in cash or deposits earning little interest. Yet these funds can be hard for business to access.
Banks are notoriously stingy lenders, and prefer to place their money in seemingly risk-free Japan government bonds (JGBs). Worryingly, over the past year, net loans at Japan's three ""megabanks"" declined by {Yen}18 trillion, or 8%, according to Bloomberg, while their overall balance sheets grew slightly as they continued favour other assets such as JGBs. 
The BOJ believes that a big cause of Japan's persistent deflation is the economy's low potential growth rate and low productivity, which quantitative easing fails to solve. By encouraging banks to lend, the reasoning goes, it may improve business sentiment to invest. Yet few expect the initiative to do much. Corporate demand for funds is weak, financial institutions must assume the credit risk of these loans, which they do not want, and there is a mismatch of duration between lending for investment (long-term) and fund provision from the BOJ (one year, in principle). Japan's animal spirits remain in deep sleep.

Yukio Hatoyama's pressure is particularly ironic considering that the Democratic Party of Japan swept into power last autumn denouncing the previous government 's interference into the BOJ . 
 The idea behind the initiative is that Japanese animal spirits are merely in hibernation , and a spurt of cash is all it takes to awaken rapacious entrepreneurs from their garages . Of course , Japanese banks are already awash in cash . Much of Japan 's colossal household wealth , one of the world 's biggest pools of savings , is in cash or deposits earning little interest . Yet these funds can be hard for business to access . 
 Banks are notoriously stingy lenders , and prefer to place their money in seemingly risk - free Japan government bonds ( JGBs ) . Worryingly , over the past year , net loans at Japan 's three "" megabanks "" declined by { Yen}18 trillion , or 8 % , according to Bloomberg , while their overall balance sheets grew slightly as they continued favour other assets such as JGBs . 
 The BOJ believes that a big cause of Japan 's persistent deflation is the economy 's low potential growth rate and low productivity , which quantitative easing fails to solve . By encouraging banks to lend , the reasoning goes , it may improve business sentiment to invest . Yet few expect the initiative to do much . Corporate demand for funds is weak , financial institutions must assume the credit risk of these loans , which they do not want , and there is a mismatch of duration between lending for investment ( long - term ) and fund provision from the BOJ ( one year , in principle ) . Japan 's animal spirits remain in deep sleep .

Ichiro Ozawa, the shadow shogun, is outboxed. Japan, at last, has a Kan-do prime minister
FOR a better sense of Naoto Kan's chances as Japan's new prime minister, dwell for a moment on the greatest contribution made by Yukio Hatoyama, his predecessor, during a lifetime dedicated to changing the political order. This was not the obvious one of his resignation on June 2nd, for all the vapidity and vacillation of the less-than-nine months he was in office. Of far greater consequence was the simultaneous downfall of Ichiro Ozawa, the secretary-general of the ruling Democratic Party of Japan (DPJ), the country's greatest living master of the dark political arts and its shadow shogun. For this alone, Mr Hatoyama's name should be praised to the rafters.
The details of the downfall are still emerging. But in the days before Mr Hatoyama's inevitable end, it seems that the more the powerful secretary-general pressed the prime minister to beat it, the more a dreamy, indecisive prime minister got in touch with his inner mule: if he was to fall, Mr Hatoyama insisted, Mr Ozawa would have to fall too. Questions hung over both men about the misuse of political funds, he pointed out, and popular disgust with Mr Ozawa as well as with the prime minister was sending the government's ratings to abysmal depths.
That Mr Ozawa's political career might come to an end matters hugely. Not even Junichiro Koizumi--prime minister from 2001-06 and in a league of his own for charisma and boldness--has so stamped the course of Japanese politics.
When he stormed out of the Liberal Democratic Party in 1993, Mr Ozawa had seen before almost anyone that the LDP's cold-war dominance had outlived its usefulness. A weak state--albeit, in effect, a one-party one; a constitution that constrains action abroad; and a cultural cringe from American dominance in post-war relations: all prevented Japan from becoming, in his words, a ""normal"" nation. ""Normal"" would have to mean organising political competition not around personality and pork but the policy choices of two main parties competing for office.
The LDP's defeat in last August's general election appeared to vindicate Mr Ozawa in spades. But by then, less appealing traits had trumped his reformist leanings. They included a taste for the Machiavellian in the exercise of power that undermined the DPJ's formal governance. They also included LDP-style patronage and pork as an electoral and governing strategy, particularly in rural districts. The strategy patently worked last summer. But the electorate did not vote out the LDP in order to see the DPJ start emulating it. The more Mr Ozawa bossed his party, the more popular opinion wanted him out.
Mr Kan, who first brought Mr Ozawa into the DPJ, was slow to recognise the liability he had become. But having got the message, he has moved with characteristic decisiveness. Mr Hatoyama, grandson of a prime minister, was born with an effete sense of political entitlement. Mr Kan fought his way up through scrappy urban politics rather than the pork-strewn rural sort from which most of his predecessors have come. He owes Mr Ozawa nothing and is already warning the bruiser off.
The few important ministerial changes he made to the existing cabinet line-up, unveiled on June 8th, make for a modernising, pointedly anti-Ozawa government. The new chief cabinet secretary, Yoshito Sengoku, the prime minister's gatekeeper on government policy, will want to deal seriously with both Japan's national debt and its deflation. The finance minister, Yoshihiko Noda, is also keen to trim election promises. Crucially, Mr Kan has retaken control of the party apparatus by installing as secretary-general Yukio Edano, whom Mr Ozawa loathes.
But most tellingly of all, early surveys of public opinion show a big bounce in the government's popularity. Mr Kan can expect to take credit for the DPJ's doing less disastrously than expected in elections for the upper house of the Diet (parliament) next month. The bounce will also dent support for Mr Ozawa among Diet members. Commentators had divined a large pro-Ozawa group, which included 142 freshmen, known as ""Ozawa's children"", who owed their seats to his tactical backing. Mr Ozawa had sway over his children for as long as he held the whip. Now Mr Kan offers the path to advancement.
And so, for the first time since Mr Koizumi stepped down in 2006, Japan's prime minister gives every impression of being in charge. Possibly that will not last. Mr Ozawa, who is 68, has suffered countless reverses before, only to charge back. Perhaps the wavy-locked Mr Hatoyama was not Samson to Mr Ozawa's temple after all. The ex-shogun mutters about a challenge to Mr Kan, whose leadership of the DPJ (and, by extension, of the country) must be put to a party vote in the autumn. ""Our fight will come in September,"" an aggrieved Mr Ozawa is said to have told his closest followers last week, while pouring them sake.
Mr Ozawa has one more means of destruction: the nuclear option of leading his true supporters out of the party. The DPJ's hopes of governing majorities in both houses would then be in jeopardy. Mr Ozawa has done as much before, ending the only other period of non-LDP rule a decade and a half ago. A big risk, ample rewards
For all the fresh turmoil it would entail, such an exit might have its rewards, by hastening a political realignment in Japanese politics, which began with the LDP's ousting last August yet which still has no end in sight. It would, for instance, make it easier for the DPJ to make common cause with newer parties of a more liberal, market-friendly hue, such as the increasingly popular Your Party, which are loth to do business with a party on which Mr Ozawa's shadow still falls. Should Mr Ozawa want to make a public show of forsaking the party he has long dominated, and provoking a bruising confrontation, well then, bring it on.","Economist.com/blogs/banyan

NAOTO KAN, Japan's new prime minister, seems to have a soft spot for the Britain of 1997, when Tony Blair's New Labour swept to power. In his first few weeks in office, Mr Kan has not only pulled off the Blairite trick of giving his party's old guard the slip. He has also wrapped himself in slogans redolent of the 1990s.
The manifesto of his Democratic Party of Japan (DPJ) for elections to the upper house of the Diet, or parliament, on July 11th begins by promising voters a ""Third Way"" of economic policy. His government talks of private-finance initiatives. His fiscal plans are full of the word ""prudent"". Mr Kan believes Japan is sitting on a dangerous heap of debt. ""If things go wrong, we could end up like Greece,"" he warned on television this week.
As quaintly last-century as some of his slogans appear, they strike an unusually bold change of direction in Japanese politics. Since Mr Kan took office on June 8th, replacing his discredited predecessor Yukio Hatoyama, he has yanked the DPJ--at least if you believe its manifesto--from a party of welfare largesse to one of fiscal discipline. Rival parties have joined the hair-shirt brigade. Suddenly, a debate on raising Japan's consumption tax--at 5%, the lowest in the rich world--has vaulted to the centre of a national election campaign. In the general election last year that ended five decades of rule by the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP), the DPJ's manifesto did not even mention the gaping hole in Japan's public finances. 
Promising higher taxes to deflation-coshed voters just ahead of an important election would be a strange calculation in any country. In Japan it has additional political and economic poignancy. The consumption tax reaped devastating results for its supporters in upper-house elections shortly after it was introduced in 1989. After it was raised to 5% in 1997, it once more harmed its sponsors and helped derail Japan's economic recovery, plunging the country into a second lost decade of economic growth.
But Mr Kan appears to have judged that, for three reasons, an election fought over tax will be less risky than in the past. First, because more voters acknowledge a rise in the consumption tax is necessary; second, because he hopes to achieve cross-party support for it; and third, because he can finesse the timing, depending on the health of the economy.
The first calculation is helped by the sovereign-debt crisis in Europe. Since January, when Mr Kan was finance minister in Mr Hatoyama's government, he has been arguing ever more frequently that Japan, the country with the largest gross-debt-to-GDP ratio in the developed world, is living beyond its means. For now, Japan has no trouble raising funds to meet its debts, and interest rates on government bonds are barely above 1%. But the finance ministry argues that within the next several years, debt on its current trajectory will exceed national savings, in which case Japan would have to look abroad for funding. 
That, government officials believe, has alarmed the public enough for it to accept that some belt-tightening is unavoidable, though opinion polls send contradictory signals. On the one hand, two newspapers reported this week that more people favour a higher consumption tax than are against it. On the other hand, support for the DPJ, which doubled to about 40% after Mr Kan took over from Mr Hatoyama, dipped this week after he mentioned the tax rise (see chart).
Happily for the DPJ, it is not alone in demanding higher taxes. The LDP and one marginal small party also call for a higher consumption tax in their manifestos. (Cunningly, Mr Kan has even referred to LDP's proposal that the tax should double, to 10%, as a ""reference point"", without stating a figure of his own.)
Not only does this deflect some of the heat onto the DPJ's rivals, but it may also put the DPJ in a stronger position after the elections. On today's voter preferences, political analysts believe the DPJ is likely to fall about five seats short of the additional 60 in the upper house that it needs for a simple majority (see table). But if other parties including the LDP believe a higher consumption tax is necessary, it may be able to draw on their support in a vote. That would forgo the need for a more formal coalition of the type that helped doom Mr Hatoyama's tenure.
Mr Kan has accompanied his party's manifesto with lengthy documents on fiscal reform and ways to rekindle sustainable economic growth after two decades of stagnation. Neither are particularly ambitious. The cut in the deficit from 6.4% to 3.2% is not envisaged before 2015, ie, three years after the administration must hold another general election. Its nominal GDP-growth targets are meagre. Even the consumption tax may not rise for two or three years, according to Mr Kan.
Some argue that the timing is not bold enough. However, for all that Japan needs strong economic leadership, there is a danger in being over-zealous on the public finances. Though the economy barrelled along at a 5% annualised clip in the first quarter, it is still running well below capacity and remains dependent on exports to China. Wage growth is miserly. Some argue that even the DPJ's plans to freeze spending at 2010 levels may be too austere for such a fragile economy.
More pressing than fiscal austerity, economists say, is the need to encourage a strong, well-balanced economy by deregulating inefficient industries and encouraging more investment. If not, the country will remain brutally exposed to the ups and downs of the global economy, and its efforts at fiscal prudence may come to nothing. That, Mr Kan might note, is the depressing 21st-century legacy of New Labour's 20th-century sloganeering.","The new prime minister tries a novel campaign strategy for upper - house elections

 The first calculation is helped by the sovereign - debt crisis in Europe . Since January , when Mr Kan was finance minister in Mr Hatoyama 's government , he has been arguing ever more frequently that Japan , the country with the largest gross - debt - to - GDP ratio in the developed world , is living beyond its means . For now , Japan has no trouble raising funds to meet its debts , and interest rates on government bonds are barely above 1 % . But the finance ministry argues that within the next several years , debt on its current trajectory will exceed national savings , in which case Japan would have to look abroad for funding . 
 That , government officials believe , has alarmed the public enough for it to accept that some belt - tightening is unavoidable , though opinion polls send contradictory signals . On the one hand , two newspapers reported this week that more people favour a higher consumption tax than are against it . On the other hand , support for Yukio Hatoyama , dipped this week after he mentioned the tax rise ( see chart ) . 
 Happily for Yukio Hatoyama , Yukio Hatoyama is not alone in demanding higher taxes . The LDP and one marginal small party also call for a higher consumption tax in their manifestos . ( Cunningly , Mr Kan has even referred to LDP 's proposal that the tax should double , to 10 % , as a "" reference point "" , without stating a figure of his own . ) 
 Not only does this deflect some of the heat onto Yukio Hatoyama's rivals , but it may also put Yukio Hatoyama in a stronger position after the elections . On today 's voter preferences , political analysts believe Yukio Hatoyama is likely to fall about five seats short of the additional 60 in the upper house that Yukio Hatoyama needs for a simple majority ( see table ) . But if other parties including the LDP believe a higher consumption tax is necessary , Yukio Hatoyama may be able to draw on their support in a vote . That would forgo the need for a more formal coalition of the type that helped doom Mr Hatoyama 's tenure . 
 Mr Kan has accompanied Yukio Hatoyama's manifesto with lengthy documents on fiscal reform and ways to rekindle sustainable economic growth after two decades of stagnation . Neither are particularly ambitious . The cut in the deficit from 6.4 % to 3.2 % is not envisaged before 2015 , ie , three years after the administration must hold another general election . Its nominal GDP - growth targets are meagre . Even the consumption tax may not rise for two or three years , according to Mr Kan. 
 Some argue that the timing is not bold enough . However , for all that Japan needs strong economic leadership , there is a danger in being over - zealous on the public finances . Though the economy barrelled along at a 5 % annualised clip in the first quarter , it is still running well below capacity and remains dependent on exports to China . Wage growth is miserly . Some argue that even Yukio Hatoyama's plans to freeze spending at 2010 levels may be too austere for such a fragile economy . 
 More pressing than fiscal austerity , economists say , is the need to encourage a strong , well - balanced economy by deregulating inefficient industries and encouraging more investment . If not , the country will remain brutally exposed to the ups and downs of the global economy , and its efforts at fiscal prudence may come to nothing . That , Mr Kan might note , is the depressing 21st - century legacy of New Labour 's 20th - century sloganeering .",740,Japan,A30-186,IN TERM,True,"the DPJ , which doubled to about 40 % after Mr Kan took over from Mr Hatoyama",13,True

THE result of the election on July 11th, in which the ruling Democratic Party of Japan (DPJ) lost control of the upper house of Japan's Diet (parliament), is awful news not just for the prime minister, Naoto Kan, and his party. On the face of it, it is awful news for Japan as well. Mr Kan faces the prospect of being unable to get anything done. After years of economic stagnation, it is tempting to conclude from yet another political failure that Japan is truly ungovernable. But at a deeper level, the vote also suggests that Japan is changing--for the better. 
After last August's optimism the mood is black. Back then voters made history in a general election that kicked out the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP). Its last, painful years in office had been marked by sleaze, ineptitude and political gridlock. Less than a year later, when both jobs and social protection are inadequate and the national debt is soaring, the DPJ has itself been tainted by sleaze; in office it has proven inept; and the election result threatens renewed gridlock. 
For Mr Kan the vote is a huge setback. He came to office only six weeks ago, offering hope. The straight-talking man of the people seemed everything that his predecessor, the first DPJ prime minister, was not. Yukio Hatoyama, rich, quixotic and indecisive, had met his end picking a needless fight with the United States over the relocation of a military base on Okinawa and then flip-flopping over how to resolve it. When he went, so too did Ichiro Ozawa, the party's ""shadow shogun"". Mr Ozawa subjugated policy and principle to winning elections with pork and deficit spending. His style closely resembled the old LDP which the DPJ had set itself against, and with both men gone, support for the DPJ grew.
Then Mr Kan blew it. His proposal to double the consumption tax in order to plug the national finances before Japan became another Greece was meant to sound like responsible politics. But the proposal looked as if it had been scribbled on the back of an envelope. And when a hostile media asked what effect more taxes would have on jobs and growth, Mr Kan flipped and flopped, Hatoyama-style. Behind the rice-paper screen
Mr Kan's future, and the DPJ's, is now in doubt. Some predict the return of Mr Ozawa's malign influence, his anti-Kan sniping vindicated. Thankfully that is unlikely--and not just because of Mr Ozawa's reputation. The opposition will also exploit suspicions over his use of party funds. Others may challenge Mr Kan for the DPJ leadership in September. If so, Japan's sixth prime minister in four years might go first.
In the short run, all this is bad news, particularly if the DPJ draws the wrong lesson and shelves discussion of a consumption tax. Amid the rubble of the DPJ's defeat, however, voters sent encouraging signals. Reformers should seize on them.
For one thing, although LDP's gains have cheered the old guard, the success is deceptive. It came in the LDP's traditional strongholds: the depopulated rural districts with a disproportionate share of the seats. When you look at votes for the seats allocated on the basis of proportional representation, the LDP's national share, at just 24% of the total, extended a long decline. This was no turnaround for the dinosaur party.
Second, the DPJ flopped mainly because candidates backing better government and pro-market growth did especially well. The sparkling performer was Your Party (
), which champions the kind of reforms associated with Junichiro Koizumi, swashbuckling LDP prime minister in 2001-06. Moreover some of the LDp's gains were made by notable followers of Mr Koizumi. The leaderships of both main parties have denigrated the Koizumi legacy for too long.
Third, in spite of their amazing fickleness in recent elections, voters have each time swung towards parties holding out the promise of reform. And each time they have then punished those who came to power and failed to deliver. The gap between people's expectations and the ability of the political system to meet them is wide. The old political order is in ruins. The new one is a shambles, but it is inching towards something better. Elections give voters the chance to prod it in the right direction.
Eventually, this should lead to a less dysfunctional political class that is able to address Japan's difficulties. Mr Kan can play his part, by using this summer's leadership contest to move his party towards the reformist centre, where it has most chance of finding common cause with the opposition (
).
If Mr Kan cannot manage this, it would be better to call a snap general election. That would put the whole question back to the voters--who seem to understand what Japan needs rather better than the people who govern them.","The bad news is that gridlock is back .

FOR the second time in less than six weeks the ruling Democratic Party of Japan (DPJ) is engaged in some deep soul searching. A stunning upset in upper-house elections on July 11th has damaged the credibility of Naoto Kan, the prime minister who took over from his even more discredited predecessor, Yukio Hatoyama, in early June.
Just ten months after it routed the long-ruling Liberal Democrat Party (LDP) in an historic election, Mr Kan's party faces what is known in Japan as a ""twisted Diet"": it does not have enough power in either chamber of parliament to get laws passed. In the election for half the seats in the upper house, the DPJ won just 44, whereas the long-in-the-tooth LDP recouped 51--its highest tally since 2001. The DPJ remains the largest party in both chambers, but it is 16 seats short of an upper-house majority (see chart). No party with anything like enough seats to narrow the gap has sounded willing to join a ruling coalition.
Within the DPJ, at least, the prime minister is blamed for scaring voters with muddled talk about an eventual increase in the consumption tax. Within 24 hours of the election, DPJ leaders made it clear that they were no longer committed to any deadlines for discussing the tax.
Mr Kan has vowed to struggle on, but it is customary in Japan for party leaders to pay a high price for election upsets; he may be ousted in a previously scheduled party-leadership contest this summer. If so, he would be forced to go as prime minister, too-becoming the fifth Japanese leader to suffer an ignoble exit in four years.
Yet before it jettisons Mr Kan the DPJ should be wary of jumping to the wrong conclusions about the vote. The results were not as unremittingly bad as the seat numbers suggest.
Koichi Nakano of Sophia University in Tokyo points out that Japan's distorted electoral map exaggerates the size of the defeat: the DPJ lost heavily against LDP candidates in depopulated rural areas that are considered to be the opposition's heartland, but which produce a disproportionate number of seats. By contrast in urban areas, DPJ candidates did better than those of its main rival. Some voters hedged their bets in the proportional-representation part of the ballot by supporting the new Your Party that is fast emerging as a third force in Japanese politics (see box on next page). But the DPJ still got the largest share of support in this part of the vote--32% versus 24% for the LDP.
As for a rise in the consumption tax, an opinion survey conducted at the polling stations by Asahi Shimbun, a newspaper, found that more voters favoured a doubling in the tax, to 10%, than were against it. Those most staunchly opposed were women in their 20s, many of whom earn meagre wages. Some of those could expect to be covered by exemptions. On July 14th the imf recommended that Japan increase the tax to 15%, starting next year.
The LDP, which gave more detail on the need for higher consumption taxes in its manifesto, found the idea gained little momentum, said Yoshimasa Hayashi, a politician in the party who campaigned with upper-house candidates in rural areas. Provided discussion of exactly how high taxes would have to rise was left vague, most people were sympathetic to the need to put Japan's debt-ridden public finances in order. ""If I said fiscal consolidation, everybody said 'yes',"" reported Mr Hayashi. 
In that case, Mr Kan's problems may have stemmed from his ill-prepared presentation of the tax debate--he gave mixed messages on what the money would be used for and who would be exempted--rather than the debate itself. ""His punishment seems to be disproportionate to his crime,"" Mr Nakano says.
A more sobering lesson for the DPJ is that voters are sick of half-baked policy proposals. They helped doom Mr Hatoyama, when he stumbled into a fruitless row with America over the relocation of a marine base in the Japanese island of Okinawa. Mr Kan's tax proposals may just have been one woolly idea too many.
As the party prepares for a leadership race, it may be split between those loyal to Mr Kan and others who support Ichiro Ozawa, an old-style, pork-barrel populist who resigned alongside Mr Hatoyama last month and has continued to snipe at Mr Kan from the sidelines. But rather than focusing on personalities, Japan needs a rigorous and long-overdue policy debate.
Reform-minded upper-house LDP politicians like Mr Hayashi say they would be prepared to support the DPJ on issues such as the consumption tax if it scraps some of its more reckless public-spending proposals, such as universal child allowances. Other parties share its goal of slimming the bureaucracy.
Such voices may well be drowned out by those seeking to force the DPJ to call a new general election--with or without Mr Kan in charge. If it does not try to win them over, however, the electoral arithmetic means it has almost no chance of governing, however long it can cling to power.","The ruling party has been battered at the polls .

ICHIRO OZAWA, Japan's most Machiavellian politician, recently dismissed Americans as ""monocellular""--using a Japanese term that roughly means simplistic. Compared with his scheming mind, Americans should take that as a compliment. On August 26th Mr Ozawa dropped a bombshell that could bring down the government, launching a leadership challenge to the prime minister, Naoto Kan, in an internal election of the ruling Democratic Party of Japan (DPJ).
If he were to win on September 14th, Mr Ozawa, 68, would automatically become prime minister, Japan's third this year alone. That would mark a remarkable comeback. Less than three months ago, on June 2nd, he was forced out as the DPJ secretary-general alongside the previous prime minister, Yukio Hatoyama, because of poor leadership and his links to a foul-smelling campaign-funding scandal for which he may possibly still face indictment this year.
It is not clear why the ruling party should want him back. An opinion poll in a newspaper, Yomiuri Shimbun, this month indicated that four out of five people opposed Mr Ozawa having any influential role in government. Yet the DPJ election, in which the party rank-and-file and local politicians have a vote, is mostly decided by the DPJ's 412 MPs. Of these at least 150 are known to be loyal to Mr Ozawa (although others loathe him), whereas Mr Kan lacks a strong faction of his own.
Whether or not Mr Ozawa believes he can win, he has other motives for running. He may be fighting on behalf of the tight political entourage that surrounds him. He said he was persuaded to run by Mr Hatoyama, with whom he has long been close, even though the former prime minister had said two days before that he would back Mr Kan.
Support from Mr Hatoyama could clinch the race because he brings a faction of about 60 MPs, according to Takao Toshikawa, the editor of Tokyo Insideline, a newsletter. He adds that Mr Ozawa is rumoured to have enticed the notoriously fickle Mr Hatoyama by promising to make him foreign minister, if elected. 
Mr Ozawa may be moved by sheer bitterness, too. Mr Kan has tried to drive his rival into the political wilderness in recent months, but then the prime minister badly misjudged the public mood during upper-house elections in July. Mr Ozawa scented revenge. 
Nevertheless his challenge carries grave risks for the DPJ and the country. A divisive race could split the party, which already lacks a majority in the upper house. And it seems to be taking the government's attention away from ruling. The yen is rising and the stockmarket plunging, which is damaging economic confidence. The constant merry-go-round of prime ministers at a time of entrenched deflation is increasingly seen as a national disgrace. 
Mr Ozawa's supporters believe he promises the sort of strong leadership that would let him build coalitions with the opposition. But his conduct at times so resembles that of an old-style faction boss of the 1970s that many, notably in the opposition Liberal Democratic Party, treat him with outright scorn. More progressive parties, knowing how much the public despairs of him and how tainted he is by the allegations of scandal, might give him a wide berth as well.

NOT for nothing is Ichiro Ozawa known as ""The Destroyer"". Over a career spent scheming in the back rooms of Japanese politics, he has made and broken alliances, toppled governments and, with laconic disdain, treated transparency and other democratic norms as so many Western pretences. Yet his latest ploy is one of his darkest. In challenging Naoto Kan, the prime minister, as leader of the ruling Democratic Party of Japan (DPJ), he threatens to bring down Japan's third government in 12 months. Worse, he may destroy what remains of the trust that voters put in the DPJ when it ended 55 years of one-party rule last year. For the good of Japanese democracy, not to mention its own future, the DPJ must reject Mr Ozawa and all that he stands for.
If the challenger does pull off a victory in the vote on September 14th--and he may--he would take over the DPJ a mere three months after he had been forced to step down as secretary-general under the cloud of a political-funding scandal. He would also replace Mr Kan as prime minister--or, if he preferred to stay in the shadows, install a puppet leader in his place. That would be a disaster, even by the sorry standards of recent Japanese politics, in which four prime ministers have come and gone in the past four years.
Among the public and his party at large, Mr Ozawa is hugely unpopular; less than 15% of the DPJ's rank-and-file support him. He has no clear policy platform. Many may justifiably wonder whether he wants to take control of his party purely out of a desire for power, or also to keep the consequences of his murky financial dealings at bay: high office brings immunity from prosecution. 
However, Mr Ozawa is not to be stopped by mere unpopularity. He excels at a form of money politics that has long plagued Japan. Running a formidable electoral machine, he provides finance and campaign management in return for the loyalty of members of parliament. Hence Mr Ozawa controls the biggest group among the DPJ's 412 members of parliament, and their vote is likely to be decisive. Never mind that voters rejected this sort of cronyism when they kicked out the long-ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) last year. No matter that few of his faction in parliament have the gravitas even to join an effective cabinet. What counts is that many MPs are only in politics because Mr Ozawa put them there. Be brave
Mr Ozawa's cronies may feel they have no option but to support him. But democratic politics is about choice, and all but the party's most short-sighted politicians face one. Mr Kan badly damaged the party during upper-house elections in July by bumbling into an ill-judged discussion over consumption taxes. But in refusing to make any back-room concessions to Mr Ozawa, and in seeing off Mr Ozawa's sidekick, Yukio Hatoyama, the former prime minister, he has started to earn back the public's respect. Support for his cabinet has risen sharply in the past week. The public seems happy that he has chosen to take the fight with Mr Ozawa out into the open.
Tribal politics has no place in modern Japan. The country, trapped in a 20-year economic funk, needs bold leadership, not blind loyalty. The divisions in the party have already had worrying economic repercussions: the stockmarket this week fell on fears that the government is too weak to stimulate faltering growth and stop a crippling rise in the yen. There is a growing fear that whoever wins the leadership contest will face a split party. That will put it in an even weaker position to cut deals with the opposition.
A fatal rupture need not happen if the DPJ, under Mr Kan, puts its faith not in its own discredited faction bosses, but in the opinion of ordinary voters. A year ago they kicked the LDP into the political outback. In June they left the vapid Mr Hatoyama in no doubt he should resign. The next month they dealt a sharp blow to Mr Kan. If the DPJ picks Mr Ozawa as Japan's next leader, it can expect no mercy.","Japan 's ruling party should cast its most famous member , Ichiro Ozawa , into the wilderness 
 NOT for nothing is Ichiro Ozawa known as "" The Destroyer "" . Over a career spent scheming in the back rooms of Japanese politics , he has made and broken alliances , toppled governments and , with laconic disdain , treated transparency and other democratic norms as so many Western pretences . Yet his latest ploy is one of his darkest . In challenging Naoto Kan , the prime minister , as leader of the ruling Democratic Party of Japan ( DPJ ) , he threatens to bring down Japan 's third government in 12 months . Worse , he may destroy what remains of the trust that voters put in the DPJ when it ended 55 years of one - party rule last year . For the good of Japanese democracy , not to mention its own future , the DPJ must reject Mr Ozawa and all that he stands for . 
 If the challenger does pull off a victory in the vote on September 14th -- and he may -- he would take over the DPJ a mere three months after he had been forced to step down as secretary - general under the cloud of a political - funding scandal . He would also replace Mr Kan as prime minister -- or , if he preferred to stay in the shadows , install a puppet leader in his place . That would be a disaster , even by the sorry standards of recent Japanese politics , in which four prime ministers have come and gone in the past four years . 
 Among the public and his party at large , Mr Ozawa is hugely unpopular ; less than 15 % of the DPJ 's rank - and - file support him . He has no clear policy platform . Many may justifiably wonder whether he wants to take control of his party purely out of a desire for power , or also to keep the consequences of his murky financial dealings at bay : high office brings immunity from prosecution . 
 However , Mr Ozawa is not to be stopped by mere unpopularity . He excels at a form of money politics that has long plagued Japan . Running a formidable electoral machine , he provides finance and campaign management in return for the loyalty of members of parliament . Hence Mr Ozawa controls the biggest group among the DPJ 's 412 members of parliament , and their vote is likely to be decisive . Never mind that voters rejected this sort of cronyism when they kicked out the long - ruling Liberal Democratic Party ( LDP ) last year . No matter that few of his faction in parliament have the gravitas even to join an effective cabinet . What counts is that many MPs are only in politics because Mr Ozawa put them there . Be brave 
 Mr Ozawa 's cronies may feel they have no option but to support him . But democratic politics is about choice , and all but the party 's most short - sighted politicians face one . Mr Kan badly damaged the party during upper - house elections in July by bumbling into an ill - judged discussion over consumption taxes . But in refusing to make any back - room concessions to Mr Ozawa , and in seeing off Yukio Hatoyama's , he has started to earn back the public 's respect . Support for his cabinet has risen sharply in the past week . The public seems happy that he has chosen to take the fight with Mr Ozawa out into the open .

ANY American president has countless audiences to please when he takes his show on the road. For Barack Obama, on a four-country tour of Asia this week, it was hard to know which mattered most: his hosts, with whom he was trying to build closer partnerships; voters at home who had just given him a shellacking in the mid-terms; or China, the elephant outside the room, with which America more or less openly competes for influence in Asia these days. 
It was chance that the tour took him to Asia's biggest and richest democracies--South Korea and Japan were on the itinerary as hosts, respectively, of the G20 and Asia-Pacific Economic Co-operation (APEC) summits. But that lent the tour its tacit theme: that, crudely put, the American model still trumps the Chinese one.
He started in India, where the trickiest job may have been persuading hard-up voters back home that getting closer to the Indian tiger would mean more American jobs created than are being lost to outsourcing. Mr Obama was able to flourish business deals worth $10 billion that he said would ""support"" some 50,000 jobs at home, notably at Boeing. 
As for the bilateral partnership, India presented an unusual challenge. Mr Obama's predecessor, George Bush, was much liked, and he himself viewed with some suspicion. But charming his hosts was easy. The earnest references to Gandhi--frugal, peace-loving, simple--drew wry smiles from India's elite. They relish their country's growing military clout and economic sophistication. 
They did, however, like the concessions Mr Obama brought, such as a partial lifting of limits on high-tech American exports. And they loved his assertion that India is not ""emerging"" but ""emerged"". His diplomatic gift, in a speech to a joint session of parliament, of support for a permanent Indian seat on a reformed United Nations Security Council soon traded at a discount. UN reform efforts, after all, are stalled. But the offer will embarrass China, which has quietly worked to thwart India's ambitions for a permanent seat. China will also be vexed by Mr Obama's encouragement of an Indian role as an East Asian power.
In comparison, Indonesia was a pushover. Mr Obama spent four happy years as a boy in the country. Now, after two cancelled visits, Indonesians still embraced him as one of their own. Mr Obama's affection for the people of the sprawling archipelago seemed heartfelt.
Indeed, he was keen to hold Indonesia up as a model. In a speech to 6,000 cheering Indonesians, he hailed the enormous advances that the country has made, and linked it to the political system. In India Mr Obama had told parliament that the country had succeeded not in spite of but ""because of democracy"". In Jakarta he made the same point about both countries. Prosperity without freedom, he argued, ""is another form of poverty"". 
Both speeches seemed direct rebuttals of the ""Beijing consensus"" in which personal liberty is sacrificed on the altar of economic growth. In both countries, too, Mr Obama lauded traditions of religious tolerance and ethnic diversity. Indonesia has more Muslims than any other country but is a land of many faiths and ethnic groups. Unsurprisingly, Indonesians lapped all this up. As one Western observer put it, the Obama visit provided ""an excuse for Indonesians to relish their own myths"".
More prosaically, the Indonesian president, Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono, and Mr Obama signed agreements to deepen the bilateral relationship in the economic, commercial and educational realms, as well as the military one. China went unmentioned. But as South-East Asia's giant, and a member of the G20, Indonesia is now poised to assume a much larger role in the region's emerging security architecture, much of it aimed at coping with China's rise and new assertiveness. 
In Seoul, besides attending the G20 summit, Mr Obama continued his pan-Asian trade mission. But he failed to revive a stalled free-trade agreement with South Korea. American concerns over access for its car and beef exports went unresolved, though Mr Obama said he hoped it would be only a matter of weeks before a deal, at long last.
It had been planned that a free-trade agreement would cap a year of warming relations with South Korea. America was robust in its support after the sinking in March of the Cheonan, a South Korean corvette, allegedly by a North Korean torpedo. The failure to announce a breakthrough may have weakened Mr Obama's message to all his hosts this week that he was committed to reviving American growth through trade. 
From Seoul, President Obama flies to Japan where he will attend the APEC summit in Yokohama on November 13th and 14th and meet Naoto Kan, the prime minister. Much has changed since his state visit to Japan a year ago, when Washington pundits worried that a change of Japanese ruling parties had made America's relationship with Japan trickier than its one with China. Not least, America's relations with China are now decidedly tricky.
Since then Mr Kan's wavering predecessor, Yukio Hatoyama, has resigned, and the new administration has revelled in backing from America over Japan's dispute with China over the Senkaku islands (Diaoyu in Chinese). In September Japan seized--and later released--a Chinese boat fishing there after it rammed a Japanese coastguard vessel. But Mr Kan's administration has failed to capitalise on the trawler incident, for instance, in garnering greater support for American troops in Okinawa, a Japanese island close to the Senkakus. Lingering uncertainties over the fate of an American marine base in Okinawa preclude that. Supporting the two countries' agreement to relocate the marine base is still considered a vote-loser in elections for the governorship of Okinawa on November 28th. 
Before he leaves, at least Mr Obama will be spared the traditional indignity of wearing silly clothes for the APEC closing photograph. Japan, which considers a salaryman suit as good as any national costume, is urging leaders to dress smartly, rather than dress up. Afterwards, Mr Obama will visit the great bronze Buddha in Kamakura, which he visited as a child when famously focused more on the matcha ice cream. A prayer for peace and tranquillity might come in handy.","Touring some of Asia's most successful democracies, Barack Obama has a message for its most successful dictatorship

MANY Japanese businessmen will tell you that the biggest problem afflicting their country is lack of political leadership. In the past 20 years there have been no fewer than 14 prime ministers, most of them forgettable. If governments whose tenure has averaged a year and a half have been unable to tackle pressing problems like deflation and stagnation, it is no wonder they have steered away from slower-burning issues such as demography. According to Takeshi Sasaki, a political scientist at Gakushuin University, the entire political class is ducking the issue, not least because ageing citizens constitute such a powerful voting block. ""The generational issues are evaded by all political parties. They remain unconsciously wedded to 20th-century demography,"" he says.
Yet lately politics has started to look a bit more promising. In September 2009 the Democratic Party of Japan (DPJ) swept to power after a landslide election victory. Voters threw out the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) that had governed Japan with barely a break from 1955 to 2009, ending a de-facto one-party system. 
The DPJ's chosen prime minister, Yukio Hatoyama, badly fluffed the party's first nine months in office, but hopes picked up in June when Naoto Kan took his place. After a run of four consecutive prime ministers whose father or grandfather had held the same job in the past, Mr Kan was the first without political connections in the family. A former patent lawyer and son of a salaryman, he also represents the growing influence of middle-aged urban voters increasingly prevailing over ageing rural ones who had been among the LDP's core supporters. The porridge party
At 64 Mr Kan can hardly be called the face of young Japan, but his government appears to reflect a long-overdue generational shift in Japanese politics. That shift was vividly shown up in the DPJ's internal election in September when a wily old fox, Ichiro Ozawa, who heads the biggest faction among the party's MPs, sought to unseat Mr Kan but was decisively rejected by the DPJ's rank and file. 
It is not easy to make ideological sense of the DPJ, a loose confederation of interest groups with ideas ranging from fiscal conservatism to Fabian-style socialism, pro-Americanism to China-hugging. Its most popular policy since coming to power has been to hold televised hearings on cutting government waste. Yet it has made little headway on its promise to reduce the power of bureaucrats, especially in ministries such as agriculture, health, education and justice. 
Some of its politicians are economic liberals but felt obliged to attack the pro-market policies of Junichiro Koizumi, the LDP's most reform-minded recent prime minister, when his legacy became bitterly unpopular during the financial crisis of 2008. Mr Kan talks of a ""third approach"" to economic policy, not exactly echoing the ""third way"" of Britain's Tony Blair but with a strong emphasis on improving social safety nets to help ease the potential pain of vigorous pro-growth policies.
Yet underlying this apparent confusion of ideas is a liberal trend struggling to emerge, says Koichi Nakano, a political scientist at Sophia University. ""The DPJ believes in a society that is less conformist and less risk-averse. The LDP tried to control society through the bureaucrats.""
Haruko Satoh, another academic, thinks the change reflects the emergence of ""popular sovereignty"" in Japan. She notes that voter turnout in the elections of 2005 and 2009 was higher than during the 1990s as people sought to overturn the old system. This may bring more legitimacy to politics, she argues: ""Democratic participation is replacing quiescent obedience.""
Something similar seems to be happening in regional politics, too, which remains staggeringly dependent on federal largesse; by some estimates, 80% of spending in the 47 prefectures is ordered by the central government. In 2008 reform-minded prefectural governors from several parties formed a group called Sentaku, aimed at reducing interference from Tokyo bureaucrats. In Osaka, Japan's second most populous region, the governor, Toru Hashimoto, aims to merge the city and the prefecture to give it Tokyo-like economic clout. In a bid to get round his recalcitrant assembly members, he has also formed a political party that he hopes will thrive on his personal popularity with voters. 
In the car-manufacturing city of Nagoya, Takashi Kawamura, a mayor with a taste for tropical shirts, enjoys strong popularity for trying to halve assembly-members' salaries to pay for a city tax cut. Citizens have called for a referendum that may lead to the assembly's abolition. Mr Kawamura has also helped establish a local political party to fight for the tax cuts. ""If people stand up, they can change society. This is the miracle of democracy,"" he says.
Both these politicians have cast themselves as crusaders, to good effect. But that has not happened at the national level. Mr Kan and his crew come across as earnest rather than electrifying. There is still a dearth of leadership.
Whenever Mr Kan was doing well in the opinion polls since taking office, his government has quickly squandered the advantage. On one occasion he carelessly talked about raising consumption taxes before elections to the upper house in July, which could have lasting consequences. Partly as a result, the DPJ lost its upper-house majority. It now faces a ""twisted Diet"", meaning it lacks enough support in both the upper and the lower house to pass and implement legislation on its own. It may be forced to form ad hoc coalitions with the LDP and other parties even to get next year's budget through. Any sign of weakness, and Mr Ozawa may once again take pot shots at Mr Kan.
Against that bleak scenario, some LDP members, such as Yoshimasa Hayashi, hope that the Kan government will scrap its plans to tighten regulation of the labour market and increase child benefits, and instead include some of the LDP's proposals in its budget plans. That, they say, might dissuade the LDP from blocking the DPJ every inch of the way.
Given the political quagmire, economic policy in the next few years is likely to remain a matter of muddling through. Conceivably Mr Kan's government may not last its term, which runs until 2013. Even so, the looming demographic challenges present an opportunity that Mr Kan should seize. The day he took office, he likened his cabinet to a ragtag militia that helped overthrow the Tokugawa shogunate at the start of the Meiji era in the late 19th century. If he can persuade Japanese voters that dramatic change is needed to secure not only their future but their children's and grandchildren's as well, last year's election may start to look like another turning point in Japanese history.

WALK into the inn in the Hokkaido village of Akanko, and everything from the welcoming cry of ""irasshaimase"" to the taciturn old man grilling chicken on the fire seems quintessentially Japanese. Until, that is, you hear all the customers speaking Mandarin. The Chinese have flocked to this area since it provided some of the settings for a 2008 Chinese blockbuster comedy, ""If You Are The One"". 
The local Japanese were shocked when the early arrivals used the onsen, or spas, to do the unthinkable: they washed their dirty clothes in the hot tubs. There is still some tut-tutting about Chinese customs--the elbows on the table, the lack of familiarity with flushing loos--but if it were not for these visitors, the tourist trade in the area would be half-dead. Before the Chinese fly out of Sapporo, Hokkaido's capital, they splurge on items like medicines and rice cookers. Tourism officials call it the ""Hokkaido boom"".
Japan is a country with immaculate service, good food, beautiful countryside and excellent beaches. As the domestic population shrinks and regional economies suffer, it makes sense to encourage increasingly affluent visitors from other parts of Asia. The Japan Tourism Agency (JTA) has at last understood this. It has set a goal of attracting 10m tourists this year, a big leap from last year's figure of 6.8m. To make this possible it has relaxed its stringent visa requirements, which used to allow in only the wealthiest Chinese. Figures up to September showed a 56% rise in tourist arrivals from China, a degree of success that has caught the Japanese off-guard.
However, in late September the JTA's plans went awry when the arrest of a Chinese trawlerman, fishing in what Japan considers its own waters, triggered the worst diplomatic incident between the two countries in half a decade. China loudly reasserted its rights to the disputed islands, administered by Japan, which the Japanese call the Senkaku Islands but which in China are known as the Diaoyu Islands. China cancelled diplomatic and cultural exchanges. When Japanese officials discovered that imports of rare earths from China, vital for some of Japan's technologies, were being held up, the fisherman was abruptly sent home. But not before all but five of 61 Chinese tour groups that had booked to visit a spa near Mount Fuji had cancelled their reservations. 
Japan still carries a lot of old diplomatic baggage in Asia. It has festering territorial disputes not only with China but also with South and North Korea, Taiwan and Russia. Japanese history books sometimes disagree with those of its neighbours, and Japan's apologies for its treatment of them during the second world war have not fully allayed their suspicions. Many in Japan seem to believe that the war started with Pearl Harbour and ended with atomic bombs being dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki. But for many Chinese, hostilities started in 1931 with Japan's invasion of Manchuria, and for South Korea 100 years ago with its annexation by Japan. Uncle Sam's umbrella
Japan was able to turn its back on Asia for most of the post-war period because of a strong security alliance with America that has now been going for 50 years. In its neighbours' eyes, that helped avert the risk of resurgent Japanese militarism. It also meant that Japan was able to keep its defence spending at less than 1% of GDP, enabling it to concentrate more resources on becoming an industrial power. But Asia's rise since the end of the cold war has complicated Japan's external relations. 
When the Democratic Party of Japan (DPJ) swept to power in 2009, ending 54 years of virtual one-party rule, one of its most controversial policy platforms was to establish a friendship with China that balanced the close post-war relationship with America--one of the hallmarks of the Liberal Democratic Party's rule. The DPJ's leaders dispatched hundreds of its MPs to pay court to Beijing. In a sign of its economic ambitions, the government later appointed a former captain of industry as its ambassador to China.
But the strategy was quickly blown off course, initially by a row with America. This was caused by a rash promise made by the DPJ's first prime minister, Yukio Hatoyama, to the people of the island of Okinawa to scrap an agreement to move America's Futenma marine base from a crowded town to a more remote part of the island. Many locals resent the American bases, so they welcomed Mr Hatoyama's pledge to reduce the burden on the island. But he failed to find a better alternative, so when last May he was forced to proceed with the move more or less as planned, it cost him his job. All this meant that foreign policy in the DPJ's first year in office focused mainly on the strained relationship with America. Pro-American countries in Asia, such as South Korea, reacted nervously to the potential threat to a security alliance that has helped preserve peace in the region for decades and acts as a counterweight to a strong China. 
Naoto Kan's government has reaffirmed its support for the alliance with America. But the Senkaku incident renewed fears within the Japanese government that China's rise--and especially its massive military spending--is a threat to Japan. DPJ politicians in the party's ""realist"" faction think that China must be made to understand that it cannot rattle its sabre with impunity. Others in the DPJ firmly believe in Japan's pacifist constitution. Others still insist that Japan can become increasingly independent of America's security umbrella, perhaps by building up its own forces, but at the same time remain doveish towards China.
Seiji Maehara, the new foreign minister in Mr Kan's government, is on the party's realist wing. He is convinced that if economic relations between the two countries were to cool it would be bad for both of them. But he adds: ""I'm neither a shallow-minded rightist nor a nationalist. I'm a realist who believes in a win-win relationship with China.""
That is where the relationship with America comes in. There was relief in Tokyo when Hillary Clinton, the secretary of state, affirmed that the Senkaku Islands were covered by America's security treaty with Japan. Yet the Kan administration may not be able to hold up its side of the Futenma bargain with America. Okinawans still staunchly oppose relocation. 
Japan, in a volatile neighbourhood, is trying to hedge its bets. Yet it is not fully secure in its relationship with either east or west. It needs America's security backing, but its industrial future increasingly depends on East Asia. In theory, the region should provide it with boundless opportunities to offset the decline in its population. METI estimates that within five years there will be more high earners living in other parts of Asia than in Japan itself. China is so big that just the increase in the number of cars sold there last year was roughly the same as the entire Japanese car market. The business case
But if the opportunities are huge, so are the challenges, and they are not just diplomatic. According to METI's statistics, Japan's sales of intermediate goods to China have tripled in the past decade, but South Korea's have increased by a factor of 11. Over the same period Japan's exports of finished goods to America and Europe have risen by a mere 10%, whereas South Korea's have increased 6.5 times and China's 5.9 times. Japan still has a large trade surplus with South Korea, partly because it sells specialist high-tech components for companies such as Samsung to put into its own devices. South Korea is so bothered by this that its officials keep trying to lure the component-makers away with promises of lower tax rates.
Japanese firms that have expanded into China have sometimes failed to grasp how different it is. They have a lot to offer their neighbour, including an emphasis on quality, trusted products and a strong service culture. They were among the earliest investors in China after the two countries normalised their relations in 1972. Shanghai-based Yasuo Onishi of JETRO, Japan's export-promotion agency, notes that Japanese carmakers, for example, enjoy strong brand recognition, even though some of their cars are too expensive for middle-class Chinese. (The Prius, however, is considered not fancy enough for China's rich.)
Chinese executives complain that Japanese businessmen too often come to lecture them rather than to listen, and that they tend not to promote Chinese managers. There are some honorable exceptions. After a series of strikes this year at companies supplying goods to Toyota and Honda, Komatsu, a maker of heavy machinery, pledged to replace all the Japanese managers at its 16 sites in China with Chinese bosses by 2012. 
Shiseido, a cosmetics-maker, has enjoyed a sevenfold increase in sales to China since 2000, says Shinzo Maeda, its chief executive. It has created brands exclusively for the Chinese market and promotes local talent, albeit with strict Japanese rules on how to serve customers. 
Such companies have a long history in China and are likely to stay the course. But they are still vulnerable to strains in the relationship. After Junichiro Koizumi, prime minister from 2001 to 2006, enraged the Chinese by making repeated visits to Tokyo's Yasukuni shrine, which honours some war criminals along with fallen soldiers, it was the business lobby that helped persuade his successor, Shinzo Abe, to break bread with the leaders in Beijing. 
More tourism within the region may help ease some of the misgivings. Culture also plays a role: many young people in Asia were brought up on Japan's J-pop music scene and manga comics. The Japanese, for their part, are wowed by South Korea's girl bands and soap operas.
But there is another thing that some of these Asian countries have in common. South Korea is already getting older fast, and even China's working-age population is forecast to start declining from 2015. If Japan can find a way of dealing with an ageing and falling population, its neighbours will be all ears.
Caption: Japan first","Nearby economies are booming , but Japan 's foreign relations are getting more complicated 
 WALK into the inn in the Hokkaido village of Akanko , and everything from the welcoming cry of "" irasshaimase "" to the taciturn old man grilling chicken on the fire seems quintessentially Japanese . Until , that is , you hear all the customers speaking Mandarin . The Chinese have flocked to this area since it provided some of the settings for a 2008 Chinese blockbuster comedy , "" If You Are The One "" . 
 The local Japanese were shocked when the early arrivals used the onsen , or spas , to do the unthinkable : they washed their dirty clothes in the hot tubs . There is still some tut - tutting about Chinese customs -- the elbows on the table , the lack of familiarity with flushing loos -- but if it were not for these visitors , the tourist trade in the area would be half - dead . Before the Chinese fly out of Sapporo , Hokkaido 's capital , they splurge on items like medicines and rice cookers . Tourism officials call it the "" Hokkaido boom "" . 
 Japan is a country with immaculate service , good food , beautiful countryside and excellent beaches . As the domestic population shrinks and regional economies suffer , it makes sense to encourage increasingly affluent visitors from other parts of Asia . The Japan Tourism Agency ( JTA ) has at last understood this . It has set a goal of attracting 10 m tourists this year , a big leap from last year 's figure of 6.8 m. To make this possible it has relaxed its stringent visa requirements , which used to allow in only the wealthiest Chinese . Figures up to September showed a 56 % rise in tourist arrivals from China , a degree of success that has caught the Japanese off - guard . 
 However , in late September the JTA 's plans went awry when the arrest of a Chinese trawlerman , fishing in what Japan considers its own waters , triggered the worst diplomatic incident between the two countries in half a decade . China loudly reasserted its rights to the disputed islands , administered by Japan , which the Japanese call the Senkaku Islands but which in China are known as the Diaoyu Islands . China cancelled diplomatic and cultural exchanges . When Japanese officials discovered that imports of rare earths from China , vital for some of Japan 's technologies , were being held up , the fisherman was abruptly sent home . But not before all but five of 61 Chinese tour groups that had booked to visit a spa near Mount Fuji had cancelled their reservations . 
 Japan still carries a lot of old diplomatic baggage in Asia . It has festering territorial disputes not only with China but also with South and North Korea , Taiwan and Russia . Japanese history books sometimes disagree with those of its neighbours , and Japan 's apologies for its treatment of them during the second world war have not fully allayed their suspicions . Many in Japan seem to believe that the war started with Pearl Harbour and ended with atomic bombs being dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki .

As markets began to lose confidence in the ability of a few countries to finance their debt, and rapidly pushed up their borrowing costs, the European Union and the IMF eventually resolved to bail out Greece and, later, Ireland. Investors also fretted over Spain and Portugal. Measures to tackle budget deficits were met with protests, especially in Greece, which endured strikes and riots. In France 1m people demonstrated against pension reforms in a single day. 
As Europe tightened its fiscal belt, America passed more stimulus measures. Barack Obama also signed into law the most sweeping changes to America's financial-regulatory system since the 1930s and a health-care reform act that was hailed by many as America's most significant piece of social legislation since the 1960s. Conservatives challenged the act in the courts. 
Unease about deficits and the ""jobless recovery"" were factors behind the increasing clout of tea-partiers in America. With their support the Republicans scored a sensational win in a special election for Ted Kennedy's former Senate seat in Massachusetts.November's mid-term elections saw the Democrats swept from power in the House by the biggest swing to the Republicans in decades. Congress ended the year on its lowest-ever Gallup approval rating--13%. 
In China the main worry was of an overheating economy. The central bank unexpectedly raised interest rates for the first time in three years amid concerns about inflation. Official trade statistics showed China had overtaken Germany as the world's biggest exporter. Tensions over currency policy were at the forefront during summits of the G20 and IMF. 
Google had a spat with China over censorship and a cyber-attack on its website there, causing it to redirect its Chinese internet searches through Hong Kong.

An earthquake in Haiti was a humanitarian disaster, killing at least 230,000 people and leaving 1m homeless. The quake devastated Port-au-Prince and left swathes of the country's fragile infrastructure in ruins. A deadly outbreak of cholera later in the year and political unrest compounded the misery. 
Drifting ash clouds emanating from a volcano in Iceland led to the closure of European air space for several days, causing the biggest disruption to worldwide air travel since September 11th 2001. 
American combat operations ended in Iraq, seven years after the start of the war. Around 50,000 troops remain in a support role until the end of 2011. Iraq continued to be troubled by violence and suicide-bombs after the Americans departed. An election was held in March, though a new government didn't begin to emerge until November. 
The war in Afghanistan rumbled on. Coalition troops mounted their biggest offensive against the Taliban since 2001. The deaths of civilians in targeted missile attacks aimed at the Taliban and al-Qaeda caused rows. GeneralStanley McChrystal was sacked as commander of coalition forces after a magazine published an interview in which he disparaged the handling of the war by America's civilian leadership. General David Petraeus took charge. 
Pakistan endured another year of severe terrorist attacks, starting on January 1st when a suicide-bomber killed 100 people at a volleyball match. In July, the Pakistani Taliban claimed responsibility for huge blasts at a Sufi shrine in Lahore and at a market in the tribal area. Rioting in Karachi after the assassination of a politician killed scores. Relentless flooding from exceptionally heavy monsoon rains affected 20m people, adding to the country's woes. 
Among the year's other deadliest terror attacks were co-ordinated bombings at two crowded bars in Kampala, the Ugandan capital. The Shabab, a Somali Islamist militia, claimed responsibility. The heat is on
A spate of terrorist assaults in Russia, including a suicide-bombing on the Moscow metro, killed scores of people. Chechen separatists were blamed. The hottest summer in Russian history resulted in hundreds of wildfires, causing a public-health crisis in Moscow when smoke enveloped the city. 
A spoof broadcast in Georgia claiming that Russia had invaded the country caused panic. The bulletin, using imagery from the 2008 Russia-Georgia war, prompted people to flee Tbilisi, the capital. 
After months of cajoling, Israel and the Palestinians sat around the table for direct talks, though the negotiations soon broke down over the building of Jewish settlements on the West Bank. The American-Israeli relationship became somewhat strained. 
Israeli intelligence was said to be behind the assassination of a senior Hamas military leader, who was killed at a hotel in Dubai. A diplomatic row ensued when it emerged that the assassins had travelled under the stolen identities of European and Australian citizens. There was another international ruckus when Israeli commandos shot dead nine people on a Turkish ship with humanitarian supplies bound for Gaza. 
The world cheered when all 33 men trapped underground for 69 days at a mine in Chile were brought safely to the surface. But mining accidents in China, Russia, West Virginia, New Zealand and Turkey each killed dozens of workers.
An election in Britain saw Labour booted out of power after 13 years. The Conservatives emerged as the biggest party but without an overall majority. After a few tense days of talks, the Conservatives formed a coalition (the first in Britain since the 1940s) with the Liberal Democrats, who came third at the polls. The new government, led by David Cameron, embarked on a radical programme of spending cuts. Joyful and triumphant
In other big elections, Dilma Rousseff won the presidency in Brazil, the first woman to do so. Julia Gillard became Australia's first female prime minister after ousting Kevin Rudd; she kept the job after a subsequent election. For the first time in 50 years Chile elected a conservative president, Sebastian Pinera. Mahinda Rajapaksa was re-elected as Sri Lanka's president; his opponent was arrested soon after. Benigno Aquino won a presidential election in the Philippines; he is the son of a late president, Corazon ""Cory"" Aquino. And Viktor Yanukovich was elected president of Ukraine, though Yulia Tymoshenko, his opponent, mounted a brief challenge to the result in court. 
Poland's president, Lech Kaczynski, was killed in a plane crash near Smolensk, Russia, along with the head of Poland's central bank, senior diplomats and military leaders. The ensuing presidential election was won by Bronislaw Komorowski, who defeated Mr Kaczynski's twin brother, Jaroslaw. 
An explosion at a BP well in the Gulf of Mexico in April killed 11 men and caused the world's biggest civilian oil spill to date, before the wellhead on the sea floor was finally sealed in September. The catastrophe forced a halt to commercial fishing in the area and a moratorium on drilling. The Obama administration faced sustained criticism of its handling of the crisis. BP's share price slumped, wiping out almost half its stockmarket value. In December America launched a lawsuit against BP and other companies potentially liable for the spill for billions of dollars in damages. 
North Korea's increasingly bellicose attitude towards South Korea rattled the world. The sinking of a South Korean navy ship with the loss of 46 sailors was blamed on a torpedo attack by the North. Later in the year the North launched an artillery barrage against a tiny South Korean island. Kim Jong Un, the youngest son of Kim Jong Il, North Korea's ailing Dear Leader, moved up the ranks as heir apparent.

""DO YOU mind if I smoke?"" rasps Kaoru Yosano, 72, a survivor of throat cancer. Mr Yosano is no quitter. At an age when, even in Japan, many politicians bow out, on January 14th he performed a flying trapeze act by joining the government of Naoto Kan, whose Democratic Party of Japan (DPJ) he has derided for years.
A year ago, when the DPJ's Yukio Hatoyama was prime minister, Mr Yosano wrote a book called ""The DPJ Destroys Japan's Economy"". But that was before Mr Kan took over with the (for Japan) radical promise of launching debate on raising the consumption (ie, sales) tax, which at 5% is the lowest in the rich world. The promise nearly sank Mr Kan, but it endeared him to Mr Yosano. Now the former finance minister (and grandson of two famous pre-war poets) has become Mr Kan's man on tax and pension reform.
It is a gamble. Mr Yosano's appointment offended many in the opposition Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) that gave him a seat in 2009 out of loyalty (ironically, he had lost his Tokyo constituency to the DPJ's Banri Kaieda, whose job in the cabinet he has just taken). Some LDP members may try to blackball Mr Yosano in the Diet (parliament). He has few natural allies in the DPJ, and does not disguise his differences. At heart he believes, perhaps hopes, the LDP can return to power, if only it reforms itself.
Yet Mr Yosano's appointment is bold, too. Even his critics acknowledge that, in taking the job at his age, he is driven more by principle than glory. He believes in urgent tax reform if fading Japan is to shore up pensions, health-care and child-support systems. Mr Kan, whose party lacks a majority in the upper house, needs more such opposition politicians. Mr Yosano may be a good model.
The new minister is still coy about how much the consumption tax should be raised. Like Mr Kan, he appears to think doubling it would be a start. Opponents say that would derail a fragile recovery. But Mr Yosano says that, on the contrary it would give people confidence about the solvency of the pensions system, which would encourage them to spend. He also believes the markets need reassurance about the health of all public finances, which he describes as ""far worse than in a few of the worst European countries"" (gross debt is twice the size of GDP).
On the timing of a tax rise, opinions in government vary. Koichiro Gemba, Mr Kan's main policy adviser, says a rise in the consumption tax should not be before the next general election, though cross-party talks should start within the next five months, with a tax increase decided by March 2012. Mr Yosano remains non-committal.
In Japan the media and the opposition seize on such differences as evidence of disarray. Yet, with a reshuffled cabinet, the government at last appears to have settled on a message of reform, including of trade and agriculture, that appears refreshingly non-partisan. Among other things, Mr Kan wants a decision by June on whether Japan should begin trade talks, including with America, under the aegis of the Trans-Pacific Partnership, a free-trade block.
For now, squabbling or even gridlock will mark the Diet at least until the spring. The opposition looks determined to try to block Mr Kan's budget, believing the tactic will score points in prefectural and municipal elections in April. But if Mr Kan can ride that out, with public opinion on his side he may yet persuade opponents to support policies that start dealing with the country's troubled finances. Japan's economy, Mr Yosano once wrote, was infected with a grave cancer. The inveterate smoker is now Mr Kan's chief ally in cutting it out.

The first is loyalty, and this is what kept Mr Mihara in the political mainstream in December, when the current rebellion within the Liberal Democratic Party began. Like many LDP members of the Diet (parliament), Mr Mihara inherited his seat from his father, who entrusted his heir to a rich faction boss; the son felt obedience was his duty. But the second political motive is ""logic"". This drove the reform-minded Mr Mihara to leave the LDP and set up his own party on June 21st.
Japanese politicians have been in a ferment of self-examination since June 18th, when 35 LDP members rebelled against the government's failure to support electoral reform and voted for an opposition no-confidence motion. An election has been called for July 18th, and LDP splinter groups are turning into new parties. But the mix of loyalty and logic will make it hard for Japan to replace LDP rule with unchaotic pluralism.
Though the logic of Mr Mihara's reformist views has pushed him to leave the ruling party, it has not led him to join the biggest group of rebels, led by Tsutomu Hata. Mr Mihara's New Party Harbinger (the name loses something in translation) has just ten members of the outgoing parliament. Two days after its launch, Mr Hata founded the New Born Party, with 44 members of the old parliament. The two new parties, says Mr Mihara, have identical policies. Personal loyalties keep them divided.
This sort of splintering heartens those who have stayed in the LDP. So far 46 of the party's members from the lower house have defected; 228 remain, not enough to form a majority should all be returned in the election. With the possibility that the LDP will lose its 38-year-old command of the lower house, its members are venting their rage publicly on the party's top brass; the foreign minister has suggested the party would be better off with Mr Miyazawa dead.
Yet the LDP is not finished. Although next month's election is unlikely to give it a majority in the Diet, it may remain the biggest party. A poll conducted by the Mainichi Shimbun; a big national newspaper, has suggested that 79% are happy to see defections from the LDP, but only 9% would vote for Mr Hata's party. The LDP had the support of 13% of respondents.
Many fear that the end of LDP dominance may mean the end of prosperous stability. A poll in another newspaper, the Asahi Shimbun, found that 61% were happy to see the government punished, and only 6% wanted the LDP to win the election outright. But just 24% favoured a government that excluded the LDP entirely. By far the most popular option, which attracted 62% support, was an LDP-based coalition.
With some form of coalition likely, everything hangs upon alliances. For the moment, no opposition party will admit to contemplating a post-election deal with the discredited Liberal Democrats. But the power of personality is making it hard for other alliances to form.
Mr Hata's party is getting the cold shoulder not only from Mr Mihara's Harbingers, but also from the Japan New Party, founded last year by Morihiro Hosokawa, another LDP defector. Like the Harbiners and Mr Hata's New Born Party, Mr Hosokawa supports electoral and campaign-finance reform, freer markets, a bigger role for Japan in the world and close alliance with America. But Mr Hata's group has a reputation for autocracy, mainly because of Ichiro Ozawa, the deputy leader, who reminds people of the LDP'S faction bosses.
Thus Mr Hata is getting more support from the Social Democratic Party, formerly the Japan Socialist Party, whose leaders have been saying that Mr Hata would make a fine prime minister. The policies of the Social Democrats clash thoroughly with Mr Hata's. They favour protection for farmers and support communist North Korea; they want Japan to disarm; their commitment to political reform is said to be shallow.
True, the party's leaders have been heaving their members rightwards. On June 22nd Sadao Yamahana, the Social Democrats' chairman, assured the American ambassador that his party favoured warm relations between the two countries. But the real reason for the party's fondness for Mr Hata has little to do with policy. As an LDP fixer in years gone by, Mr Ozawa excelled at buying votes from the former Socialists. Some may still owe him loyalty.
Before it was dissolved, the Social Democrats held 137 seats in the lower house. Mr Hata says he hopes to field 100 candidates in the general election next month. Even if all Mr Hata's people and all the Social Democrats win, an alliance between the two parties would be 19 short of an overall majority. It might make up the number by drawing in the small Democratic Socialist Party, or the Buddhist-linked Clean Government Party. Or it could form a minority government if the Communist Party promised not to vote against it. On the other hand, support might leak from this alliance. Hardline socialists within the Social Democrats, including some influential ones, might resign. Precarious as this sounds, Mr Hata has a greater chance of forming a government than anybody else. Though Mr Hosokawa's Japan New Party is doing well in the polls, it is unlikely to come up with more than 60 candidates. The most likely alternative to Mr Hata, therefore, is more LDP.
Whatever its unpopularity among urban sophisticates, the LDP has support in the countryside where votes count for up to three times those of townspeople. The party has devoted years to bribing the villages with railway lines and farm subsidies. LDP politicians have deep roots. They bring presents to weddings and funerals; they find jobs for slow sons and husbands for plain daughters. And they are well organised. The LDP will probably field 280 candidates.
Before this month's events, Mr Hata and his friends talked dreamily of brining about two-party politics on the American model. Perhaps Japan will get there in the end. In the meantime it seems set for bewildering coalition.","In politics , says Asahiko Mihara , there are two kinds of motive .

On June 27th, nine days after the Liberal Democratic government collapsed, the main opposition party was clobbered. Though the LDP did surprisingly well in Tokyo's metropolitan-assembly election, winning 44 seats (up from 42 last time), that other old stalwart, the Social Democratic Party, will have 14 seats in the new legislature, down from 29.
The Social Democrats, who despite a name change still look more socialist than anything else, are as much a feature of Japan's post-1955 political order as is the LDP. They have provided a largely token opposition to the LDP, but have had some effect on policy: they have, for instance, retained strong pacifist beliefs, and have therefore consistently blocked attempts by more nationalist elements within the LDP to redraft Japan's anti-militarist constitution.
The socialists' rebuff means they will have to move to the right if they want to survive. It also calls into question the wisdom of Tsutomu Hata, the LDP rebel leader who brought down the government and then created his own New Born Party, in choosing to start discussions with them. Mr Hata has been talking to the Social Democrats about a possible alliance in the general election scheduled for July 18th.
The parties are badly matched ideologically: both Mr Hata and his deputy leader, Ichiro Ozawa, claim to favour a more assertive Japanese foreign policy. The main reason for a New Born-Social Democratic alliance was Mr Hata's personal difficulties in coming together with the other LDP rebels. Now, after the Tokyo election, it looks as though Mr Hata's decision to dump the Liberal Democrats for the Social Democrats might leave him swapping one political millstone for another.
Mr Hata has one other consequence of the Tokyo election to ponder. The Japan New Party, which was founded last year and is thus the oldest of the three parties that boast of their newness, won 20 out of the 22 seats it contested. Scoffers say the Japan New Party has no policies and will prove no more than a fad, but they may be wrong. Its leader, Morihiro Hosokawa, another LDP defector, has a pretty face and an aristocratic pedigree (which appeals even in supposedly classless Japan).
Buoyed by the results of the Tokyo election, the Japan New Party will get another boost when it merges, as it announced on June 30th it would, with the New Party Harbinger, led by Masayoshi Takemura, another LDP defector. The New Born Party, meanwhile, is having to put together an electoral machine for a poll barely a fortnight away.
Amid all this confusion it would be wrong to treat the Tokyo election, in which the turnout was only 51%, as a pointer to the outcome of the general election. But the Tokyo poll does suggest that, however the parties in Japan eventually shake down, the left wing is not likely to have much weight. Even if the LDP holds on to power at the general election, an outcome which at present looks unlikely though far from impossible, it will be wrong to assume that it is business as usual in Japanese politics.
One reason why uncertainty will continue is the trial of the LDP'S former political godfather, Shin Kaneman, on charges of tax evasion. One LDP member of the Diet (parliament) says the trial, due to being on July 22nd, looms over Nagatacho, Tokyo's political district, like a ""thin dark mist obscuring the sunlight"".
As the authorities pursue their investigations, the case continues to claim victims. On June 29th the mayor of Sendai and six building company employees were arrested. More arrests are expected before Mr Kanemaru appears in court. The trial will expose much that is unattractive about Japanese politicians-not just those in the LDP, but also those among the reformers, particularly Mr Ozawa, who were close to Mr Kaneman.

They are gathered in support of Kenzaburo Hara, a stalwart of the ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) who was first elected to the Diet (parliament) in 1946. Why, at the age of 86, does Mr Hara want to carry on in office? ""He has no son,"" explains a spokesman, implying that nobody else could inherit the great man's electoral machine. Besides, 50 years' continuous service earns a statue outside the Diet building. Mr Hara is very nearly there.
Seven candidates are fighting it out in this drab chunk of Osaka's suburbia. Under Japan's odd multi-member constituency system, five will win in the lower-house election on July 18th. Like archaeological layers, the campaign of each candidate holds clues to his political era. The older ones seem a world away from Japan's modern preoccupations; their burial in the current political turmoil seems long overdue.
What, for example, motivates the middle-aged campaigner in the Communist Party's small office? Not power: the party is determined to stay out of coalitions, and therefore to avoid putting its ideas into practice. Instead, the campaigner reminisces about his young days as a labour activist, when wages were low and capitalism seemed rotten.
Or take Yoshitada Konoike, another LDP candidate, 34 years Mr Hara's junior. His election office hints at the corrupt links between business and politics that brought the LDP government down a month ago. A stream of suits passes through the doorway, pays its respects to more suits seated in the reception, then deposits lists of backers' names before proceeding sleekly on its way. How generously do the suits back Mr Konoike? Each year they contribute Y120,000 $1,100) ""plus a secret"", says a prosperously sun-tanned man.
The constituency also has the policy-free Clean Government Party, whose candidate is unfailingly elected thanks to generous Buddhist sponsorship. Then there is Takako Doi, a former leader of the Social Democratic Party, whose charm will overcome her party's dated policies: support for North Korea and disarmament, opposition to nuclear power. But most of the excitement surrounds the Japan New Party, which was founded last year.
The New Party's campaign manager is Yasuhiro Koike. He speaks English, likes yachting, and his work as a development-aid consultant has taken him to 85 countries (""not counting the ones I stayed in for less than four days""). The candidate is his younger sister, Yuriko. She speaks Arabic as well as English. Her debut in television journalism came when she arranged an interview with President Qaddafi of Libya.
Ms Koike's campaign style contrasts instructively with that of the aged Mr Hara. Before large audiences, Mr Hara gets down on his knees and bawls, ""Please make a man of me."" On more intimate occasions he tucks envelopes of money under supporters' cushions. Ms Koike, aiming to create the relaxed atmosphere of a television talk show, sits on a bar stool near a bus stop or shopping centre, voicing the preoccupations of modern Japan. Education, she says, should emphasise creativity and initiative. History classes should not gloss over the second world war. Pupils' spoken English should be improved, to help Japan's relations with the outside world.
Ms Koike's fame as a television anchor ensures her election. Her party, by contrast, will win only a fraction of the number of seats commanded by the LDP (see chart). (Chart omitted). Yet the party's more serious weakness is its ambivalence towards power: it relishes its outsider status and is wary of joining a coalition after the election. It talks, instead, of co-operating with other parties on an issue-by-issue basis; it might back opposition efforts to get political reform enacted, then back the LDP'S conservative defence policy. The party's leader, Morihiro Hosokawa, is woolly on policy and shows little ambition to hold a senior cabinet job.
Fear of power is the old malady of Japan's opposition. It spreads from the politicians down to their supporters. A local journalist full of praise for the multi-lingual Ms Koike is shocked at the suggestion that she would make a fine foreign minister. Emboldened by drink, three trade unionists, who contribute monthly to the Social Democratic Party's coffers and declare that they will vote for it, say it would be awful if their party assumed the responsibility of government. ""Yes, we are contradicting ourselves,"" they smile.
So political pundits concentrate on another opposition outfit, the Japan Renewal Party formed last month by a group of LDP rebels led by Tsutomu Hata, a former finance minister. Though Mr Hata himself has been a hit on television, his followers lack Ms Koike's flair and freshness: nearly all come from the notoriously corrupt Kanemaru faction of the Liberal Democrats. But nobody doubts that Mr Hata and his friends want to form a government, which is why they excite more interest than Mr Hosokawa's genial gang.
Mr Hata has already talked to the Social Democrats and the Clean Government Party about forming a post-election coalition. But, unless he can tempt the New Party to join him, he is unlikely to muster the numbers needed to prevent the LDP'S continued rule. An overall LDP majority is unlikely, though the party has been gaining in the polls. Given the opposition's fear of power, however, an LDP minority government seems entirely plausible.
Whatever government emerges, it is unlikely to be stable; most predict at least one more election in the coming year. This brings back the old doubts about Japan's politics: that it is incapable of reforming itself, that the LDP is destined always to hold power. That is too pessimistic. In a country famous for consensual support of an everruling party, the prospect of instability is proof enough of change.","The election office is full of laughing pensioners in militarist head - bands : their foreheads proclaim Certain Victory , and display the red circle of Japan 's flag .

Which party did Mr Inoue represent? ""I don't know,"" comes the reply, ""but a friend asked me to back him."" This show of democratic zeal is more than many Japanese mustered in the election on July 18th.
The turnout, at 67%, was the lowest ever. The results looked less than exciting. The ruling Liberal Democratic Party, though shaken by scandal and splits, won all but four of the 227 seats in the Diet (parliament) left to it after rebels had created two new parties. After the election, five independents joint the LDP. It is still three times as big as the largest opposition party, the Social Democrats.
Yet changes there are. For the first time since 1955 the LDP finds itself without a majority in the lower house of the Diet. Four days after the election the party dumped its leader, Kiichi Miyazawa, because he had failed to reform the political system. A shouting match then broke out between old LDP chiefs and younger men demanding that the new leader be chosen by an open vote, not by a deal among election bosses.
The Social Democrats, for their part, lost 64 of their 134 seats. The leftist policies this party never quite brouht itself to drop -- support for disarmament, opposition to nuclear power and yet support for near-nuclear North Korea--now carry little political weight. Though the Communist Party still has 15 members of the lower house, Japan's left is all but finished.
The old parties of left and right have made room for the new centrists. The Japan New Party, formed last year, increased its representation from nil to 35, plus one after an independent joined; it is now set to merge with the 13-strong New Party Harbiner, most of whose members are LDP Secessionists. Then there is the even newer Japan Renewal Pary, set up last month by a former LDP finance minister, Tsutomu Hata. This party now holds 55 seats, 19 more than before the election. That is a fair achievement, given that the Renewal Party had barely a month to field candidates.
This marks the rise of a new kind of politician. LDP candidates have usually been elected with the help of support groups, which distribute money and favours to the voters. Lacking cash and friends, new candidates resorted to new methods. They appeared on television; they enthused student volunteers with their ideas; they put about the novel view that politics need not be monopolised by sleazy insiders.
Banri Kaieda, a Japan New Party candidate in central Tokyo, is typical. He decided to stand for the lower house less than a month before the vote. The election officer of his LDP rivals were covered with framed messages of support from local interest groups. But Mr Kaieda, who exudes a professional charm that befits a television commentator, came top of the poll.
At his election-night party, a bond trader in jeans and cowboy boots said Japan had taken a step towards America, where children dream of being president. From now on, young Japanese will also feel that politics is open to them. The feeling will deepen as television makes further gains at the expense of patronage. Japan's businesses are cutting their donations to the LDP; television is getting livelier. ""Japan needs a Larry King show,"" says the bond trader earnestly.
Calls for more vigorous debate are common amon new centrists. For the past 40 years, they say, Japan was united in pursuit of economic growth. Now it must weigh this against new priorities: defence, the environment, personal consumption. Finding the balance requires open argument, preferably conducted in an American-style two-party system. Ichiro Ozawa, Mr Hata's deputy, has shown his appetite for forthright talk in a new book which shocks many pacifist Japanese by advocating armed participation in United Nations peacekeeping work.
Where Japan will be a few years hence is clearer than where it will be tomorrow. The 228-seat LDP is 28 short of an overall majority. A coalition of Mr Hata's Renewers, the three socialist parties and the Buddhist-linked Clean Government Party could muster 195 seats. To govern, either side would need the help of the New Party. Its leader, Morihiro Hosokawa, veils his plans in mystery.
A year ago Mr Hosokawa said he wanted a two-party system. That was when it seemed impossible. Now he is in a position to bring Japan a lot nearer to two-partydom by joining an opposition alliance. But he gets on badly with Mr Hata's men; and he is thought to be holding out for the top job, even though his party would be only the fourth-biggest in the coalition. Speculation that he might join the LDP quietened on July 22nd, when he said he would not do that. His prevarication is unpopular. On a television show this week, an irate supporter said Mr Hosokawa should return his votes if he meant to do nothing with them.
The politicians promise to end their squabbles by Audust 2nd, when the Diet is to meet to elect a new prime minister. A different uncertainty may persist. On July 22nd the trial begins of Shin Kanemaru, the LDP faction boss whose downfall last year prompted the split in his party, and so eventually this month's election.
Mr Kanemaru's trial will expose some of the vast bribes that he used to buy the loyalty of party colleagues. Plenty of other LDP men, including some ex-LDP new centrists, are in danger of being tarnished. The pretrial investigation of Mr Kanemaru's affairs has already netted two provincial mayors. Their trials may in due course implicate other politicians.
Nobody knows whether the next government will last out the year, still less whether it will reform the electoral rules, blamed for fostering money politics. Reform, if it happens, could encourae the shift from porkbarrel to policy. But, judging from this election, that shift is happening anyway.","In the anonymous stream of a Tokyo expressway , an anonymous taxi driver declares , "" I voted for Inoue .

 The turnout , at 67 % , was the lowest ever . The results looked less than exciting .

After the election , five independents joint the LDP . It is still three times as big as the largest opposition party , the Social Democrats . 
 Yet changes there are . For the first time since 1955 the LDP finds itself without a majority in the lower house of the Diet . Four days after the election the party dumped its leader , Kiichi Miyazawa , because he had failed to reform the political system . A shouting match then broke out between old LDP chiefs and younger men demanding that the new leader be chosen by an open vote , not by a deal among election bosses . 
 The Social Democrats , for their part , lost 64 of their 134 seats .

Morihiro Hosokawa is a conciliator, a waffler, a man apparently without ideals. Apart from his good looks and his relative youth (he is 55), he seems remarkably like the grey men who have dominated his country's politics for nearly four decades.
Yet Mr Hosokawa's route to power is unprecedented in Japan. Until the election on July 18th, his Japan New Party was a tiny opposition group in a country where opposition parties hardly mattered. Now Mr Hosokawa heads an eight-party coalition that will, barring unforeseen catastrophe, put an end to 38 unbroken years of rule by the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP).
Mr Hosokawa, an aristocrat and former provincial governor, fence--sat his way to the top job. The LDP lost its majority in parliament thanks to the defection in June of a group led by Tsutomu Hata, a former finance minister. In the subsequent election, Mr Hosokawa's New Party increased its lower-house strength from nothing to 35 seats. By keeping vague about which side he might join, Mr Hosokawa set his price high.
On July 22nd Mr Hosokawa spurned the LDP's advances. He then minced coyly towards a coalition of opposition parties. He said he would join them only if they accepted his version of political reform; the opposition assented. He said they should reconcile other policy differences; a suitable, if rather limited, joint manifesto was concocted. Finally, on July 29th, Mr Hosokawa accepted the coalition's offer to propose him as prime minister; ""it is my fate,"" he explained modestly. Since the coalition controls 245 seats to the LDP's 225, Mr Hosokawa is all but certain to get the job when the Diet appoints a new prime minister shortly.
The coalition is an odd one. The New Party, Mr Hata's Japan Renewal Party, and another LDP splinter called the New Party Harbinger, are centre-right; the Social Democrats still hold to some hard-left policies. But the Social Democrats lost so many seats in the election that they have little clout, whereas the reformists have momentum behind them. The alliance has agreed not to dwell on the Social Democrats' more extreme ideas, such as support for North Korea. Instead, it unites in calling for a fiscal stimulus, and for keeping Japan's rice market closed to imports. It also favours clearer apologies for Japan's behaviour in the second world war.
After the problem of keeping the alliance together, the new parties' main difficulty will be working with the bureaucrats, who have run Japan for four decades, with the LDP as their political front. Many LDP parliamentarians are ex-mandarins, including Kiichi Miyazawa, the outgoing prime minister. The boss of each ministry holds the rank of vice-minister, and usually wields more power than his political superior; but the LDP has never interfered in appointments to these positions. In exchange, the bureaucrats have bent the rules to help the politicians' business sponsors. Until the election two weeks ago, this ensured the flow of business contributions to the LDP, and so the continuation of the LDP-mandarin partnership.
The new parties represent a revolt against the power of civil servants. From his days in the provinces, Mr Hosokawa bitterly recalls how hard it was to extract the bureaucrats' permission to move a bus stop in his prefecture. Many of his followers also come from local politics; hardly any are former civil servants. Masayoshi Takemura, who leads the New Party Harbinger, is another ex-governor. Most of Mr Hata's people in the Japan Renewal Party come from the LDP, but not from the ex-bureaucrat part of it: their faction was led by populists from the countryside.
Some coalition members, especially Mr Hata's people, say that it is time for politicians to take control of policy. Such radicalism makes the bureaucrats anxious. ""The emphasis might shift to policies with good sound-bites,"" said a disdainful man from the Ministry of International Trade and Industry (MITI) to a Japanese newspaper. The reform of the electoral system and of campaign finance, the coalition's main priority, is unlikely to provoke a clash with the bureaucracy. Decentralisation, another coalition goal, would reduce the ministries' power; but the coalition may not hold together long enough to pursue this ambition. As a result, a fight between politicians and bureaucrats is more likely to centre on taxation.
The finance ministry shudders at the prospect of a cut. Last year the government ran a budget deficit of Y1.5 trillion, or 0.3% of GNP--tiny by most countries' standards, but enough to rattle Japan's prudent mandarins. Hard times are depressing tax revenues, so this year's shortfall is likely to be bigger. But hard times also spur those who want a tax cut, and the coalition partners smell a chance to defy the bureaucrats and make themselves popular.
The battle could complicate the budget process. The government already looks certain to miss the deadline, which falls at the end of July, by which time it is supposed to announce a ceiling for the growth of next year's budget. Ministries are meant to submit requests for spending by the end of August. Unseemly delay could result in squabbles among coalition partners, and thence to the political deadlock feared by those who wonder whether coalition government can really work in Japan.","There could be no better symbol of Japan 's paradoxical change than Morihito Hosokawa's .

JAPAN SHIFTS
In Japan a sevenparty coalition, led by Morihiro Hosokawa, was due to assume power, ending nearly four decades of rule by the Liberal Democratic Party. Signalling a change of policy towards Japan's role in the second world war, the foreign ministry formally apologised to Asian ""comfort women"", who were forced into prostitution by the Japanese army.

This failed to halt the Serb advance on the city. Bosnia's president, Alija Izetbeovic, resumed--and then suspended-talks with the presidents of Serbia and Croatia over partitioning Bosnia.
Italy's parliament finally passed the law on electoral reform. Most seats will be chosen under a first-past-thepost system. The leader of Italy's federalist Northern League, Umberto Bossi, promptly suggested that elections be held this autumn.
Parliament also voted to lift the immunity of Bettino Craxi, a Socialist former prime minister, who faces charges of corruption and illegal party financing.
Baudouin, King of the Belgians, died at the age of 62. He is succeeded by his brother, Albert.
Spain's prime minister, Felipe Gonzalez, asked unions and managers to agree to freeze wages and dividends next year, and to only small rises in 1995 and 1996.

The assumption of power this week by a coalition of parties with an internationalist bent may help prevent the resurgence of a worrying kind of nationalism.
History suggests that Japan is ripe for a bout of nationalism. Previous periods of openness to the world have been followed by xenophobic extremism. After some adventurousness in the 17th century, missionaries were expelled, their converts executed and contact with foreigners virtually prohibited. In the 1930s, half a century of avid learning from the outside world gave way to virulent fascism. Since the second world war, Japan has again been absorbing foreign influences eagerly. A backlash would not be surprising.
A few signs of a harder mood are already emerging. Japan is cracking down on immigrants, whose numbers multiplied in the late 1980s. In May the police arrested 102 foreigners, mostly Iranians, in a park in central Tokyo. Right-win groups have put up anti-immigrant posters around town; some feature swastikas.
Japan's admiration for America is increasingly tempered by disgust at its violence and racial troubles. In 1985 a poll conducted by the New York Times, CBS and the Tokyo Broadcasting System found that 73% of Japanese regarded their relations with America as ""friendly"". In July this year the same pollsters found that just 35% felt that way. Hard times have bred impatience with American trade demands, and president Bill Clinton has voiced those demands more stridently; Japanese bureaucrats, in response, have attacked American trade policy with unaccustomed vigour.
In defence, too, Japan is more assertive. North Korea recently tested a missile with a range long enough to hit Japan; it may try to arm the missile with a nuclear warhead. In the past, Japan might have left America to deal with this threat. Now it is buying its own AWACS early warning aircraft and Patriot anti-missile defences. During July's G7 summit, Japan even expressed doubts about a proposal to extend the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty indefinitely.
To the Westerners who have been badgering it to contribute more to international security, Japan's new willingness to assert itself is welcome. But outsiders, Western and Asian alike, also want greater frankness from Japan on two issues-how badly it behaved during its last bout of nationalism, and how fast and to what purpose its military power is rowing now.
The coalition government led by Morihiro Hosokawa, who was expected to become prime minister this week, seems keen to be open. It promises to replace grudging expressions of regret about the second world war with forthright apology. The foreign ministry has already taken action: on August 4th it formally apologised to the ""comfort women"" forced into wartime prostitution. Japan, goes the new official line, should learn from its guilt. The faults of the past are to be engraved in Japanese memories through history teaching.
The coalition also seems ready to talk frankly about Japan's contemporary power. Japan has 250,000 people under arms for ""self-defence"", yet its constitution forswears the use of force. Uncomfortable war memories make Japan's leaders unwilling to admit their country's military might, so they have shrunk from revising the constitution. The Japanese people, too, prefer not to talk about these matters.
Arguing that power is dangerous only if it is hidden from democratic scrutiny, the coalition wants to break the taboo and add to the constitution a clause explicitly allowing Japan to take part in United Nations peace-keeping operations. The chief proponent of this view is Ichiro Ozawa, who declined a cabinet post but remains one of the most powerful men in the coalition. By pulling its weight in the UN, he argues, Japan could ensure that its own interests were looked after; peacekeepers might be sent to China, for example, if violence threatened Japanese investments. This would remove the temptation for Japan to pursue its interests independently.
Mr Ozawa talks openly about Japan's ""national interest"". This phrase strikes many Japanese as jingoistic. Yet Mr Ozawa prefers to admit to nationalism, rather than to suppress it, on the rounds that extremism is more likely to brew in a bottled-up Japan than in an open and confident one.
The coalition's election is reason in itself to worry less about Japan's historical extremism. Floating around in Japanese society, there are still ideas of the sort that encourage fascism. There is the idea of Japan's national ""uniqueness"": if the Japanese are held to be unique as a race, there is not much scope for the individual Japanese to be unique. Suspicion of individualism links in with Japan's emphasis on conformism. Free thought suffers in such a climate, and logic is sometimes dismissed as an unsuitable western habit. A book published in 1978, arguing that Japanese brains functioned differently from western ones, became a best seller.
Japan's old-style politicians shared these failings. They protested that foreigners did not appreciate Japan's uniqueness, and avoided discussing the past. In last month's election campaign, top people from the ruling Liberal Democratic Party denounced Russia's foreign minister as a ""hairy barbarian"" and America as a place where ""they sell marijuana everywhere"". That sort of chauvinism amuses foreigners; and, increasingly, it embarrasses Japanese.
The coalition's record is not unblemished. Tsutomu Hata, the deputy prime minister, once suggested that foreign beef might not agree with Japanese intestines. But Mr Hata is now full of internationalist talk; his younger followers like the idea that they are not so different from foreigners. Their ideas are a revolt against Japan's dangerous old mysticism. So was the act of voting them into government.","The most important result of Japan 's recent general election may be something that did not happen .

The minister of international trade and industry, guardian of big business, was to be a member of the left-wing Social Democratic Party. Or the job might o to Akio Morita, the outspoken but politically unaffiliated chairman of Sony. In the event, it was all a bit of a disappointment. Japan has had its first change of government in 38 years, but the new members are mostly old-timers.
The prime minister, Morihiro Hosokawa, and his chief cabinet secretary, Masayoshi Takemura, are Fresher than their colleagues. Both defected from the long-ruling Liberal Democratic Party (Lop), but they have been provincial governors, and so removed From the discredited national government.
Other big jobs have one mainly to the Japan Renewal Party, the second-biggest group in the eight-party coalition. Until June most of the Renewers were members of the LDP'S most powerful and corrupt faction. The Renewers' chief, Tsutomu Hata, is a former LDP finance minister; now he is deputy prime minister and foreign minister. Other Renewers are in charge of finance, trade and industry, agriculture and defence.
Mr Hata is the only minister with previous cabinet experience. But the defence and agriculture ministers were LDP parliamentarians for 17 years before becoming reformers. Ichiro Ozawa, Mr Hata's deputy, has no cabinet job but pulls strings from behind the scenes, just as he used to in his days as an LDP fixer. The ministers of finance and of trade and industry are both ex-bureaucrats from the departments they now run. This sits oddly with the coalition's promise to shift power from civil servants to democratically accountable politicians.
The cabinet does include three women, one more than the previous record. Its average age is 59, two years younger than its predecessor.

But the bright, inexperienced new breed that emerged during July's election has been kept out of office. Like Bill Clinton, another provincial governor who made it to the top, Mr Hosokawa has gathered experience around him.
Mr Hosokawa says that foreign, defence, economic and energy policies will stay on the rails laid down by the LDP. This is an exaggeration. In foreign policy, the new government is determined to apologise for the second world war. ""It was a war of aggression, and it was a mistake,"" said Mr Hosokawa on August 10th. In economic policy, the coalition claims it will pursue deregulation more keenly than did the LDP. There has also been talk of a tax cut, but the new team does not seem to have decided how to square this with the finance ministry.
The biggest change will be electoral reform. Plans may be published as early as next week, and Mr Hosokawa has promised to implement them by the end of the year. Some coalition members are threatened by a shift from multi-member constituencies (which are generous to small parties) to a mixture of proportional representation and signal-member ones (in which only the top vote-winner in each area gets elected). The Social Democrats, who lost half their seats in July's election, are particularly twitchy. It will be hard for them to ripe, since their leader, Sadao Yamahana, has been given the political-reform portfolio; but he is now threatening to resin his seat as penance for his party's poor electoral showing.","In the days between Japan 's election on July 18th and the appointment of the new cabinet on August 9th , all sorts of exciting rumours circulated .

For a Japanese, and a god-like one at that, it was the most humbling of moments. But never was it taken as sufficient atonement for a heavy burden of guilt. The responsibility was not, of course, only or even mainly Hirohito's. A few Japanese were punished for their misdeeds. But then cold-war imperatives intervened.
The issue refuses to go away. Now it revolves around whether, some 50 years later, the world should still be demanding apologies from Japan. ""In victory, magnanimity,"" was Churchill's view. But others, notably some of Japan's neighbors, are still nagging the Japanese to prostrate themselves.
The Japanese--unlike post-1945 West Germany--were not quick to admit any guilt at all, still less to teach their own young people about it. Their approach has been to evade the question by denying facts: that Asian women were enslaved as prostitutes for the Japanese army, or that biological warfare experiments were carried out on captive humans. Yet recently they have begun to say sorry. In 1991, Emperor Akihito apologized for Japan's colonial occupation of Korea. During a visit to Beijing last October, he said of the Japanese occupation of parts of China in 1931-45, ""I deeply deplore this"". The foreign ministry recently admitted that sex-slavery did occur. And this week the new prime minister, Morihiro Hosokawa, went about as far as a patriotic politician could by describing the Pacific war as an act of aggression and apologising for the ""pain"" inflicted by Japan on other countries. Is this not enough?
The Euro-American view of history is that it is a story that can reasonably be revised by each generation; that is how you try to et to the truth. Should Churchill have made peace with Hitler and saved the British empire? Was the atom-bombing of Japanese cities justified? The Japanese are less accustomed to this sort of self-examination. They may disagree about the past: this week a critic of Mr Hosokawa said that Japan fought ""for self-defence and the independence of Asian countries"". But the differences tend to be kept in private, because it is thought that individual views openly expressed will be seen as a group view. That also explains why this issue will not go away.

It does not mean that Japan should keep on apologising for acts committed long ago. True, it would be wrong to excuse any war crime, though it is hard to be sure where Japan's acts should lie on the spectrum of villainy. Japanese troops did not conduct the systematic slaughterlet alone run gas-chamber camps--that Hitler's men did in Poland and Russia. They did practise experiments of the sort done by Josef Mengele. They did kill Chinese civilians in the 1930s, though the carpet-bombing of Dresden and Tokyo, and the atom-bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, produced similar evils. Leave aside, then, the depth of the apologetic bows : if today's Japanese governments should still be saying sorry for acts committed by predecessors 50 years earlier, then so should others.
Yet apologies 50 years later are beside the point. This should no loner be an international issue, argued about by diplomats and ministers. In Japan's case, the issue is in truth a domestic one: that facts have been denied or obscured, debate muzzled, whatever the ""correct"" interpretation of those facts. Such turning of blind eyes is a common Japanese trait, but it stores up trouble.

In style, it was a remarkable rhetorical departure, passionate, sharp and critical of bits of Japan's past. In content, though, it was less adventurous. While promising change, Mr Hosokawa was value about what it might entail. His reticence stems from the disagreements inside and outside his coalition about almost everything he wants to do. A paralysed government, if such it proves, is something Japan cannot afford at a time when economic troubles are multiplying.
As the yen has risen, from Y125 to the dollar in February to its peak of Y100.4 last week, so the economics have got gloomier: the commentators' rule of thumb is that each 10-yen rise knocks 0.5% off the following year's growth rate. A rotten summer made thins worse, as the rain has kept people at home, away from the shops. Most commentators now reckon the economy will turn out to have shrunk in the second quarter of this year, brining forecasts of 1993 growth down from 296 to 1o. In the 12 months to June, industrial production was down by 5%. The discount rate, already at an all-time low, is expected to be cut lower yet.
The trade surplus with America-a huge diplomatic cloud--continues to row. In the first half of this year, it reached nearly $27 billion, 20% higher than in the same period last year. Last week's intervention by America's Federal Reserve to stem the rise of the yen suggests that America is giving Mr Hosokawa the benefit of the doubt. For the moment. He is due to explain his longerterm plans to lessen the surplus to Bill Clinton at a summit at the end of September.
Faced with the twin problems of recession and the trade surplus, Mr Hosokawa is expected to announce an economic package just before the summit. It will have to be big, to have any ect: the previous such package, in April, was worth Y13.2 trillion ($117 billion). The Americans would be mollified by a bi tax cut: Y5 trillion is the sort of figure being bandied around. The Finance Ministry Is resisting the idea fiercely. ""No need,"" said a senior official on August 25th; nor of monetary stimulus either. The only clue Mr Hosokawa gave was a promise, which surprised listeners, not to issue deficit-financing bonds: that could imply that he had bowed to bureaucratic pressure against tax cuts. But the government could meet its needs by issuing short-term, rather than long-term bonds: in Japan's financial jargon they do not count as deficit finance.
Ichiro Ozawa, the backroom boss of the coalition, is believed to favour a stimulus; but he wants to do it through an income-tax cut and a consumption-tax increase. The Social Democrats, who make up the biggest chunk of the coalition, oppose that idea. Since everybody pays consumption tax, and income-tax thresholds in Japan are high, they fear that such a package would benefit the rich at the expense of the less well-off.
Mr Hosokawa's speech was understandably woolly, then, on his attitude towards fiscal stimulation. He was firmer on the need for ""promoting deregulation"". This is needed to make importing easier, to cut costs to consumers and to reduce the power of the bureaucracy. There are, at present, 10,900 different sorts of permits through which Japan's civil servants regulate business. Getting rid of these would infuriate not only the civil servants, whose power it would threaten, but also the many businesses whose interests are vested in the existing system. According to an official of the Japan Renewal Party, one of the leading lights in the coalition, deregulation ""is just a lot of hocus-pocus"".
Even the much-heralded clean-up of politics seems to have run into trouble, though supposedly it is at the top of the government's agenda. The aim is to replace the present system, which gives each constituency several members, with a single-member system based partly on proportional representation. More important, the coalition says it wants to abolish corporate donations to political parties. The coalition members have spent the past week haggling about the proposed changes.
The argument for shifting away from a multi-member system is that it would encourage a strong two-party system. That would hurt smaller parties. Mr Hosokawa's own Japan New Party and most other members of the coalition are prepared for this, but the Social Democrats, who lost seats in the election of July 18th, are blocking political change, even though their own party leader, Sadao Yamahana, is the coalition's minister for political reform.
To reform party finance, the government would have to introduce a new bill outlawing payments by industry to politicians. There are some sins that business is prepared for change. At the end of last week, Keidanren, the mouthpiece of Japan's blue-chip companies, said it would stop collecting political funds from its members, virtually all of which went to the Liberal Democratic Party that was ousted in June. Some, however, intend to resist. The Bankers Association, for instance, has said that its members, in the past generous financiers of the LDP, will continue to contribute.
Mr Hosokawa can take a more leisurely attitude to political reform than he can to economic decisions. The rising yen and falling growth need to be tackled now. If Mr Hosokawa does not by mid-September deliver a package that satisfies both the Americans and his coalition partners, he may face a problem of a falling government as well.","Morihito Hosokawa's , cut a brave figure delivering Morihito Hosokawa's inau%ural speech to the Diet on August 23rd .

In June Mr Hata's people defected from the long-ruling and long-corrupt Liberal democratic Party (Lop); now Ml. Hata is part of a new coalition government that promises to cleanse politics. The Social Democrats (formerly the Socialists) are also part of that government. If Mr Hata's toadiness offends too many allies, the coalition could collapse. Political reform would crash with it.
One test will come on September 18th, when the Social Democrats elect a new party leader. The outgoing chief, Sadao Yamahana, meekly agreed to coalition policies that contradicted his own party's leftist foibles, such as supporting Stalinist North Korea. Indeed, on September 4th Mr Yamahana demonstrated his willingness to please by becoming the first Social Democratic leader to visit South Korea.
Mr Yamahana's preferred successor, Wataru Kubo, would carry on this pragmatism. He enjoys the support of most Social democratic members of the Diet. But the rank and file are disgusted by Mr Yamahana's softness, so a leftist victory is just possible.
Other parties could disrupt the coalition. Ichiro Ozawa, the string-puller behind Mr Hata, plans to make the Renewal Party the biggest non-LDP group. He is talking to two other coalition members, the Buddhist-linked Clean Government Party and the small democratic Socialist Party, about a possible merger. Less openly, he is wooing some 20 LDP parliamentarians; he has approached a few right-win Social Democrats too. This might produce a group with 150 members in the lower house The LDP has 225; other parties have 135.
Mr Ozawa's plan is a threat to other coalition members. The Japan New Party of the prime minister, Morihiro Hosokawa, is planning a more modest merger with the small New Party Harbinger of Masayoshi Takemura. Mr Ozawa and Mr Takemura get on badly. The battle lines for the next election, expected next year, are forming.
Yet rivalries are not blocking compromises on important issues. The Ozawa and Takemura camps disagreed, initially, on what kind of electoral system should replace Japan's multi-member constituencies, which are costly to manage and so encourage corruption. They have now settled on 250 single-seat constituencies, with another 250 seats parcelled out through proportional representation. This represents a con cession by Mr Ozawa, who had wanted to weaken smaller parties by having just 200 proportionally chosen seats and 300 constituencies. In exchange, Mr Ozawa got the coalition to drop its plan to ban political donations from companies. Mr Ozawa has lots of tycoons as backers.
For the moment, the government is popular. A poll by Kyodo news agency, which put the approval rating of the old LDP government at 22% In May, reported on September 8th that the Hosokawa cabinet has a record 79% rating. To keep its appeal, the government needs to stimulate the economy. The central bank is expected to chip in with an interest-rate cut and the government says it will announce a fiscal stimulus on September 20th.
The government also has a committee looking into ways of passing the benefits of the strong yen to consumers, by cutting prices for imported goods, among them as and international telephone calls. Another panel is studying tax reform. Yet another is working on an ambitious plan to deregulate the economy and so make it more open to imports.

The Ozawa and Takemura camps disagreed, initially, on what kind of electoral system should replace Japan's multi-member constituencies, which are costly to manage and so encourage corruption. They have now settled on 250 single-seat constituencies, with another 250 seats parcelled out through proportional representation. This represents a con cession by Mr Ozawa, who had wanted to weaken smaller parties by having just 200 proportionally chosen seats and 300 constituencies. In exchange, Mr Ozawa got the coalition to drop its plan to ban political donations from companies. Mr Ozawa has lots of tycoons as backers.
For the moment, the government is popular. A poll by Kyodo news agency, which put the approval rating of the old LDP government at 22% In May, reported on September 8th that the Hosokawa cabinet has a record 79% rating. To keep its appeal, the government needs to stimulate the economy. The central bank is expected to chip in with an interest-rate cut and the government says it will announce a fiscal stimulus on September 20th.
The government also has a committee looking into ways of passing the benefits of the strong yen to consumers, by cutting prices for imported goods, among them as and international telephone calls. Another panel is studying tax reform. Yet another is working on an ambitious plan to deregulate the economy and so make it more open to imports. Japan's big newspapers are redeploying their reporters to beef up political coverage: businessmen and bureaucrats used to pull the strings, but the initiative is shifting to the politicians.",740,Japan,A29-8188,,False,,0,True

The trick was in the small print--where else?--demanding that the imports met Japanese ""specifications"". Two decades of negotiations and studies, and nurturing orchards to these specifications--for example by monitoring a huge, 500-metre swath around each orchard for insects and disease--have yielded not a single bushel of Japanese sales for Washington growers.
The latest episode in the saga has been the most sour. Last year, after settling yet another supposed Japanese fear--this time about an American insect called the coddling moth--Washington's apple rowers were convinced that their next harvest would past muster. Then, in June, the Japanese announced that they wanted to inspect orchards at spring blossom time, a procedure they earlier had said was unnecessary (blossom time is an odd season to inspect apples anywhere). Coincidentally, this year's crop had already blossomed by June, meaning another year would pass before the new requirement could be met. Various other orchard inspections, also requested in June, would require five months to complete--well after this year's harvest is over.
The Japanese insist that they have legitimate fears about the importation of diseases such as a fruit-tree virus called the fire blight. Desmond O'Rourke, director of the International Marketing Programme for Agricultural Commodities and Trade at Washington State University, prefers to blame the political power of Japan's 90,000 apple growers, most of whom are small farmers.

Most Japanese apples are a variety known as Fuji that make popular presents for special occasions. With no competition, save a few imports from New Zealand, Fuji apples command prices of up to $5 each. Washingtonian apples would sell for a fraction of that, but they would start with a taste disadvantage: American varieties, such as ""golden delicious"", have not been eaten by Japanese consumers since the 1960s.
Apples could become a test case of the Clinton administration's efforts to open Japanese markets by appealing to the supposedly more consumer-oriented Morihiro Hosokawa, Japan's new prime minister.

In most areas the latter maintain a stranglehold over the distribution of their products, deciding who can sell them and at what price. Because this cartel in effect keeps out cheaper foreign imports, the discounters' struggles are closely followed outside Japan. The discounters' overall share of Japan's Y120 trillion ($1.2 trillion) retail market remains tiny-little more than 3%. Can they break through?
The recession has encouraged consumers to ferret out bargains, while the strong yen has made imported goods even cheaper than Japanese brands. Now discounters may get political help as well.
Japan's new prime minister, Morihiro Hosokawa, claims to be in favour of deregulating Japan's shops. Earlier this month, the government laid out a preliminary plan, promising to make it easier for retailers to open new stores, easing up restrictions on opening hours and holidays, and liberalising rules on alcohol licences. More details of the package are due on September 20th.
The debate will be given added edge by a fierce battle between the discounters and Japan's three big cosmetics companies, Shiseido, Kao and Kanebo. This summer Kawachiya, a small discount store, started selling cosmetics from these manufacturers at 30% below their recommended retail prices. Kawachiya's cosmetics sales increased by 70% in one month, while neighbouring shops saw their sales halved. At the end of July, the big three manufacturers stopped deliveries to the discount house. Shiseido claims it took the action not because of Kawachiya's pricecutting, but because Kawachiya was selling Shiseido products to other retailers.
Yasuko Kanehara, Kawachiya's boss, denies this hotly. In August he referred the three firms to Japan's Federal Trade Commission (FTC), accusing them of breaking antitrust laws. This is not the first time that Mr Kanehara has taken on big-name manufacturers. Over the past few years the FTC has twice ruled in his favour over disputes concerning discounted drinks.
Shiseido is now preparing its defence. It is also calling for new laws that would allow manufacturers to protect their ""brand images"" by determining where their products were sold. Around 70% of Shiseido's products are sold through its own network of 25,000 small perfumeries scattered throughout Japan. Although Shiseido's set prices are high, these small retailers usually keep only 5%. Shiseido helps them out in other ways, sending its own employees to talk to customers and taking back unsold goods.
Encouraged by both the new political climate and the battle with Shiseido, many discounters are expanding rapidly. Aoyama Trading, a specialist discount store and Japan's biggest retailer of men's suits, is diversifying into casual wear, helped by a licensing deal with J-C. Penney, an American department-store group. Aoyama plans to open over 100 new stores in the next two years. In October Falkner, a big Japanese clothing firm, will become the first manufacturer to turn discounter when it opens a shop selling cut-price returned goods.
Mr Kanehara, who has been battling with manufacturers for over 30 years, is sceptical. For example, although the government claims to be opening up the discount liquor business, laws still make it almost impossible for discounters to buy mom-and-pop liquor stores. Japanese consumers--not to mention foreign firms--must hope such anomalies will be short-lived.","THE battle between Japan's maverick discount stores and the country's manufacturers is hotting up.

Among the world's industrial economies, Japan was by r the best-placed to withstand a crash in asset prices, a shrinkage in bank lending and a large-scale rescheduling of property and other debts. One reason was that the country's ""real"" economy, its manufacturers and other businesses, was so resilient. But the other was that its government was sitting on a hue fiscal surplus. While America and Western Europe have been prevented by public-sector deficits from boosting demand in Keynesian ways, Japan has had plenty of scope to do so. And it has, to the tune Of Y24 trillion ($200 billion) in two huge public-works packages, announced in August 1992 and April this year. Yet far from turning Japan into a locomotive to pull the world, these packages have failed to prevent the economy from retreating further into recession.
Hence the third such package, announced by Japan's prime minister, Morihiro Hosokawa, on September 16th. Like his predecessors, he is hoping to revive the economy by increasing public spending, chiefly on infrastructure; this time, it is claimed that the package is worth Y6 trillion. But that is where the flaws in this approach begin. Actually, the package is worth far less: probably just half of that is real spending, the rest being doomed to founder on various bureaucratic obstacles. Japanese politicians like to be able to brag about big numbers, whether they are claimed reductions in trade barriers when negotiating with Americans or, as now, when they represent claimed extra oomph for the economy. Americans long ago ceased to believe such claims. Now, it seems, ordinary Japanese do not believe them either. These fiscal packages may have helped the recession to be a bit less bad than it otherwise would have been. But they have not achieved their other aim: to revive confidence among consumers and corporate bosses.
The finance ministry has also been devious: it has wanted to achieve a fiscal boost without actually running a fiscal deficit: its spending ""increases"" have been exaggerated, its zeal to cover them through stealthy taxation has been impressive. For the ministry abhors the thought of borrowing; it abhors the thought of tax-cuts even more. So although Japan's public-sector surplus has fallen substantially, from 3o of GDP in 1991 to rough balance now, most of that swing is due to the cyclical effects of recession on tax revenues and welfare spending.
A BOOST FOR THE WALLET
Given time, the Japanese economy will recover; now, it is being depressed by a strong yen (which hurts exporters, see page 78), by falling corporate investment and by weak consumer demand. But recovery could be some way off, for the effects of excessive corporate investment and property debts have still fully to work their way through. If the government and its advisers in the finance ministry want to shorten that time, they will have to change their approach.
The finance ministry has sound reasons, in the long run, for its dislike of borrowing and of tax-cuts: the ageing of Japan's population promises to increase the burden on the state and on public pension funds early in the next century. It hates cutting taxes because it is hard to raise them again. But this should not preclude short-run expedients when, as now, such thins do feel necessary. A swing into fiscal deficit would give a counter-cyclical boost to the economy; achieved through cuts in income tax, it would place cash directly in consumers' wallets, offering a greater chance of helping confidence, and spending. The ministry anyway wants to shift the balance away from direct taxation and towards the indirect sort.

Britain and China could tell America and Japan a thing or two about badly-managed trade disputes. They got into an argument a while ago about China's trade surplus with Britain. When negotiations failed, the British sent gunboats, forced the Chinese to buy British-made goods--and soured relations between the two countries for a century-and-a-half.
Bill Clinton seems unlikely to emulate the aggressive Lord Palmerston, foreign secretary and prime minister during the Opium Wars; nor is he likely to try to redress the balance of trade by forcing America's drugs surplus on the Japanese when he meets Japan's new prime minister, Morihiro Hosokawa, next week. But there is a danger in the administration's decision to focus its foreign policy on economic issues--which, in the case of Japan, means the trade deficit. Fixated by those figures, Washington is in danger of blinding itself to an aspect of the relationship far more important to America's future.
Japan's trade surplus with America shrank during the second half of the 1980s, then began to grow again in 1990. Its revival coincided with the collapse of the Soviet empire, then of the Soviet Union. By wiping out the threat from communism in Europe and diluting it in Asia, the Soviet collapse down-graded in the minds of some the importance of friendship with Japan. That gave strength to the school of thought politely described as ""revisionist"", more vulgarly known as Japan-bashing. It includes politicians such as David Bonior, the Democratic chief whip in the House of Representatives, who tabled an amendment threatening the withdrawal of American troops from Japan, if Japan did not cut its trade surplus.
Mr Clinton's own attitude seems ambivalent. On the one hand, his appointment of a Democratic grandee, Walter Mondale, to be ambassador to Japan signals the importance he places on relations with Tokyo; on the other hand, most discussions with Japan since he took office have focused on his ""results-oriented"" trade policy. The idea is to shrink the deficit by persuading the Japanese to allocate slices of their markets to American companies. Behind it is an implicit threat about what might happen if the ""results"" are not achieved.
LOOKING FOR TROUBLE
Endangering America's friendship with Japan in this way is mistaken for several reasons. Trade grievances cannot be measured by the size even of Japan's overall surplus, let alone its bilateral balance with a single country. A smaller Japanese surplus would not imply lower trade barriers, just as a larger one does not imply that the barriers are getting higher. And, however large its deficit, America should not be demanding slices of the Japanese market: such an approach has nothing to do with the free trade and competition to which Mr Clinton says he is committed. In any case, the chances are that the bone of contention may soon be buried. When Japan's economy (and thus its domestic demand) begins to recover from recession, probably early next year, its imports are likely to rise rapidly, reducing the trade imbalance.
Certainly, America has some legitimate reasons for complaint: Japan blatantly protects some of its markets. But Mr Hosokawa does see the need for deregulation. And there are other reasons, too, why America should be readier to treat Japan as a partner, not as an obstacle.
For more than four decades, from Japan's defeat in the second world war to the crumbling of the Soviet Union, America could reasonably take Japan for granted. Cowed by its grisly past, and fearful of communism, Japan stuck close under America's nuclear umbrella. But Japan is starting to come to terms with the past: talking about it more openly, thinking about asserting itself abroad through the United Nations, even discussing the possibility of changing its pacifist constitution.
Japanese attitudes towards America are shifting fast. In June 1985 only 21% of Japanese thought that relations between the two countries were broadly ""unfriendly""; in June 1990 36% did; in June 1993 64% did (compared with only 25% of Americans). Mr Clinton may also find Mr Hosokawa's attitude different from that of his predecessor, Kiichi Miyazawa. Mr Miyazawa broadly welcomed outside pressure (gaiatsu) as a useful way of overcoming resistance to change in Japan. Mr Hosokawa now has a Japanese mandate for change and may take less kindly to being pushed about by foreigners. Gaiatsu is out, naiatsu (internal pressure) is in vogue.
There is much at stake if America mishandles its partnership with Japan. North-east Asia, just across the Pacific from America, is probably the world's most dangerous region. There is that loose cannon, North Korea; the vast unpredictability of China's future; the sulkiness of still-powerful Russia. The closeness between America and Japan makes all this less dangerous than it might be. America's military presence also gives Japan a sense of security, which it might otherwise try to achieve by over-arming itself. Were a rift to row between the two, a Japan thinking more aggressively about its own security might then provoke its neighbours to do the same. Indeed, America might find bogeys lurking in the future much more frightening than a giant trade deficit.","BETTER TO PREPARE FOR TOMORROW 'S GENUINE FEARS THAN FOR TODAY 'S FALSE ONES

Japan knows all about burden-sharing, but it feels its efforts are not appreciated in full. On September 25th the prime minister, Morihiro Hosokawa, starts a trip aimed at remedying that deficit. He will meet Bill Clinton, and try to stand up to him. And he will address the United Nations, on whose Security Council Japan would like to sit permanently.
To win respect for their generous internationalism, Japan's diplomats have taken to burden-boasting. Foreign journalists are summoned to lunch by the man in charge of Japan's aid programme. Japan announces that it has forked out the full $196m sought by the UN as a contribution towards peace-keeping, and hopes that other countries will do likewise (America owes the UN $800m). Next month the Japanese will host an elaborate conference on African development.
The Japanese like to present their relations with America as an extension of this worthiness. At July's G7 summit of rich countries, the Americans and Japanese agreed to talks on a wide range of subjects; these have begun. To the Americans, the talks that matter are about opening Japan's markets. To the Japanese, they are about Japan and America tackling world problems together. Economic development and the environment are popular causes. A new research centre on biodiversity in Indonesia, staffed and paid for by the two countries, is one example.
Japan would like to extend such co-operation to other countries, and so spread the appreciation of its benevolence and power. It plans, for example, to work with the Association of South-East Asian Nations on giving aid to Cambodia. It may help Indonesia's President Suharto, who heads the non-aligned movement, to get developing countries to send aid to one another: South-South co-operation is a fond Suharto theme.
Japan's politicians, like its diplomats, are growing more assertive. The country's coalition government has been in power for less than two months; but it has issued policy pledges with Clinton-like vigour. It promises to cleanse and deepen Japanese democracy, a promise that won applause this week from John Major when he met Mr Hosokawa in Tokyo. It has announced a 6.2 trillion ($58.3 billion) programme that should eventually stimulate demand for imports and so please Americans who detest Japan's trade surplus. It has a plan to deregulate 94 parts of the economy; this should lower barriers to entry and so please the Americans some more. Given the coalition's instability, the ambitious deregulation may come to naught. Still, the Japanese have realised that, to be recognised as an international big shot, it helps to be loud.
Recognition comes slowly. Japan has America's support in its bid for the Security Council; but then every president since Richard Nixon has backed Japan's cause. It has pacified the other four permanent members by assuring them that Japan seeks to join them rather than replace them. The most difficult hurdle, however, is to persuade big regional powers--Brazil, India, Nigeria--to accept permanent seats for Japan and Germany but not for themselves. Jumping that one could take years.
The economic tensions with America may ease more quickly, partly because Mr Hosokawa bristles with concessions, and partly because the strong yen should shrink Japan's trade surplus before long. But the military part of Japan's relationship with America still seems more durably unbalanced. The government includes leftists who oppose changing Japan's pacifist constitution. Even hawks in the government talk only of deploying troops abroad as part of UN peacekeeping efforts; unilateral force is still ruled out. Barring some unforeseen calamity, Japan's dependence on America's security umbrella is fixed--and with it the balance of power between the two leaders.","It contributes lavishly to multilateral institutions ; it paid billions towards the Gulfwar ; it is the biggest donor of development aid . Japan knows all about burden - sharing , but it feels its efforts are not appreciated in full . On September 25th Morihito Hosokawa , starts a trip aimed at remedying that deficit . Morihito Hosokawa will meet Bill Clinton , and try to stand up to him . And Morihito Hosokawa will address the United Nations , on whose Security Council Japan would like to sit permanently . 
 To win respect for their generous internationalism , Japan 's diplomats have taken to burden - boasting . Foreign journalists are summoned to lunch by the man in charge of Japan 's aid programme . Japan announces that it has forked out the full $ 196 m sought by the UN as a contribution towards peace - keeping , and hopes that other countries will do likewise ( America owes the UN $ 800 m ) . Next month the Japanese will host an elaborate conference on African development . 
 The Japanese like to present their relations with America as an extension of this worthiness . At July 's G7 summit of rich countries , the Americans and Japanese agreed to talks on a wide range of subjects ; these have begun . To the Americans , the talks that matter are about opening Japan 's markets . To the Japanese , they are about Japan and America tackling world problems together . Economic development and the environment are popular causes . A new research centre on biodiversity in Indonesia , staffed and paid for by the two countries , is one example .

On September 30th Japan's Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries (MAFF) said that it would for a while lift its ban on imported rice. Although Morihiro Hosokawa, Japan's prime minister, recently hinted that Japan might permanently open its borders, the new imported rice will have more to do with bad weather than protectionist guilt. This year's rice harvest looks likely to fall at least 2m tonnes short of the usual 10.5m tonnes. The prospects for next year's crop are little better. In the teeth of this emergency, at least 1m tonnes of foreign rice will be let in.
For years Japan has argued that foreign rice must be kept out to ensure food security and protect Japan's rice culture. Too bad that the Japanese pay up to nine times more than anyone else for a bowl of the stuff. Officials at MAFF sometimes claim that rice has never been imported (except in the form of Awamori, a traditional alcoholic drink fermented from Thai rice). When South Korea came to its rescue once before, in 1984, the government argued that it was just the importing country's way of paying off an old debt. In fact, ever since the import ban was first imposed 40 years ago, foreign rice has found its way into the country somehow:
* Choseihin, the processed rice found in flour or food, is often foreign. Most of the shrimp rice pilaff sold in local stores is imported--although the number, size and relative weight of shrimp to rice in a pilaff is subject to esoteric specifications. Similarly rice flour is imported in a mix with calcium carbonate and sucrose; the importers later blow out the calcium and sucrose to get back pure rice flour.
* Even raw rice has sometimes been imported, notably mochi, the cheap rice used in crackers. Large trading houses apparently hold annual quotas and can break the import ban and buy mochi from America, China or Thailand when they are short.
* Every Japanese citizen is allowed to buy 100 kilograms (220 lbs) of rice from abroad each year. Mail-order rice has been booming in Japan.
So will the lifting of the ban threaten Japan's ancient rice-growing tradition? Even before the second world war, Japan imported vast quantities of rice, notably from its Korean colony. These imports had a turbulent effect on pre-war Japanese politics, as many military men came from the rice-growing regions of Japan. That excuse no longer applies.","TOKYO

Mr Yeltsin said Russia would honour the Soviet Union's commitments to Japan. Japan's diplomats hope he includes a 1956 treaty promising the return of two islands. But Russian nationalism makes compromise difficult, and a deal looks far off.
Mr Yeltsin extracted equally guarded hints about the prospects for Japanese investment in Russia. The Russians have oil and other minerals that Japan lacks; this has led Japanese firms to set up some 200 joint ventures in Russia's Far East, about a fifth of the region's catch of foreigners. Few of these ventures are doing much as yet, and Japan's government reckons that fewer than a fifth are making profits.

His coalition government won Japan's election in July by promising political reform. Then, faced with a depressed economy, Mr Hosokawa promised tax cuts and deregulation. Next, to soften Russia's position on the disputed Kurile islands, Mr Hosokawa promised to encourage Japanese investment in Russia's Far East. Threatened with American sanctions, he promised on October 26th to reform Japan's closed construction-bidding system.
So far the promises are working. The Americans postponed the sanctions threat (see page 76). On October 21st the Russians too indulged Mr Hosokawa, cancelling a second planned clumping of nuclear waste in the Sea of Japan. At home, Mr Hosokawa is the most popular Japanese prime minister in the history of opinion polls; his bold talk is a relief after the long and waffly rule of the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP).
But soon the audience will want results. In theory, Mr Hosokawa should have no difficulty in carrying out political reform by December 15th, his self-imposed deadline. His coalition has agreed on a reform package: the present, corruption-prone system of multi-member constituencies is to be replaced by a mix of proportional representation and single-member constituencies; rules on campaign funding are to be tightened. Since the coalition holds an overall majority, getting these changes through the parliament might seem a mere formality.
But things are not so simple. Japan's leaders are expected to court consensus, so Mr Hosokawa wants to get the Liberal Democratic opposition's support. Negotiations are going slowly, and the December deadline is beginning to look over-optimistic.
Progress is scarcely better on deregulation, the second Hosokawa promise. On October 27th a committee of wise men concluded months of study on how to streamline government; its proposals are destined for the filing cabinets. The previous week another committee, set up by the prime minister himself, submitted the first draft of a deregulation plan. A retired civil servant dominates the drafting committee; his document is masterfully free of detail.
Slow progress on political reform and deregulation suggests that other Hosokawa plans--market-opening, a tax cut--may be hard to implement. In the end, unfulfilled promises and economic loom may undermine his popularity. Yet this does not mean that Japan's hopes of democratic rebirth have dimmed entirely: Mr Hosokawa's example is having an effect on others.
The prime minister's efforts have one broad aim: to check the power of the bureaucracy. Deregulation would do this directly; political reform would do it indirectly, by giving parliamentarians the legitimacy they need to face down civil servants. Mr Hosokawa does not talk about the third way of checking bureaucratic power, which is to strengthen the judiciary. Yet this is the field in which most is happening.
A VANGUARD OF LAWYERS
The most visible evidence of new judicial zest comes from the office of the Tokyo public prosecutor. Sensing that the end of LDP rule gave it free rein, the prosecutor has now arrested more than 20 local politicians and construction executives who allegedly traded public-works contracts for illegal election campaign money. This is an attack on bureaucrats too, since they run the bidding system and oversee the construction companies. On October 27th the construction minister announced that several senior officials under him would be punished.
A week earlier the education ministry also felt the brunt of new judicial assertiveness. The Tokyo High Court ruled that the ministry had abused its authority in ordering Saburo Ienaga, a historian, to rewrite part of his text book about the second world war. Mr Ienaga had written that Japanese troops raped Chinese women in Nanjing in 1937; the ministry deemed this unfit to print. In past trials the ministry got the upper hand; this time Mr Ienaga had the better of the verdict. Many Japanese reckon the LDP's fall explains this shift of fortune.
Other, less noted legal shifts are eroding the power of the bureaucracy. In the past, ordinary citizens have been unwilling to challenge government. Setsuo Miyazawa, who teaches law at Kobe University, cites a comparison with Germany. In 1989 just 1,119 suits were filed in Japan to contest the legality of government actions; in West Germany there were around 450,000.
The costs of a legal challenge have sometimes been set deliberately high to discourage citizens from taking on government. In Osaka, for instance, a group of citizens wanted a court injunction against the dispatch of Japanese troops on a United Nations peacekeeping mission on the rounds that this would violate Japan's pacifist constitution. An Osaka district court had set the cost of filing the case at a prohibitive Y95m ($800,000). In August the High Court cut it to Y1m.
Japan's justice ministry has traditionally headed off judicial checks on the bureaucracy by influencing the appointment and promotion of judges. In particular, the ministry saw to it that lawyers with experience as private attorneys were not appointed; instead, judges were chosen from among the more loyal lawyers working in the Supreme Court bureaucracy. That has recently been changing. This month alone, three judges have been recruited from the ranks of practising attorneys.
The bureaucrats retain the power to punish liberal judges with jobs on far-flung rural benches. If, as in America, the executive's nominations to the Supreme Court had to be confirmed by the legislature, the bureaucrats would be further weakened. One day such radicalism might just seem possible.","Morihito Hosokawa's is good at making promises .

A glaring exception is construction, where Japan's market has a deserved reputation for secrecy, corruption and restrictive practices. On October 26th Morihiro Hosokawa, Japan's prime minister, promised reform of the closed bidding system for construction projects; he thus won a reprieve from the American government, which had threatened that on November 1st it would ban Japanese construction firms from participating in federal projects. The new deadline is January 20th 1994. That still leaves Mr Hosokawa with a lot to do.
Japan's ""designated bidding system"" is an entrenched part of the construction business--particularly in the public sector. Contracts are secretly parcelled out to a limited number of applicants selected in a mysterious pecking order. Japanese construction firms defend the system because, they say, an American-style open and competitive tender procedure ""wastes time"" by attracting a large array of bids from inexperienced firms. Although a competitive system ensures cheaper prices, they argue, it does not ensure that the job gets done well.
The chief losers from this nonsense are foreign firms. American firms are unlikely to win more than a thousandth of the Y8.4 trillion ($80 billion) of government construction contracts due to be dished out this fiscal year. In 1992 a big Californian construction company, Bechtel, tried to win a place as one of the builders of the Tokyo Bay highway project. Bechtel was the only firm disqualified; all 27 of the Japanese firms qualified. The reason given: Bechtel had built tunnels of only six and a half metres (21 feet) in diameter, whereas its Japanese competitors had built ones of more than seven metres. Nobody, however, had experience of building 14-metre tunnels, the specification listed in the project.
In America Japanese firms earn roughly $1 billion a year from federal projects. In an effort to keep this business, Japan's Ministry of Construction last month unveiled an experimental open-tender bidding system for 13 big projects. This has been rightly condemned as a sham worthy of ""Catch-22"". It was limited to a few ""A"" status firms. How can a foreign firm qualify for ""A"" status? Only by having completed a project in the Japanese market.
In addition, foreign firms must surmount numerous non-tariff barriers, usually involving close ties between the various public purchasers and local construction companies. Even before bidding begins, construction firms or a host of free services to the public purchaser, including designing the project. During the bidding the purchaser often compels construction firms to form joint ventures with. smaller rivals--the latter being chosen for their political connections rather than ability. If a company fails to bid in a project to which it has been ""designated"", it is sometimes banned from bidding in future ones.
Even without pressure from America, Mr Hosokawa, who claims the mantle of reform in Japanese politics, has good reason to sort out the construction industry. This week five executives from Kajima, Japan's biggest construction firm, were accused of bribing local-government officials to secure publicly financed projects. Kajima's board includes seven former bureaucrats from the construction ministry. Since June more than 20 businessmen and politicians have been similarly accused in scandals concerning the construction industry.","Japanese firms are often wrongly accused of excluding American firms from markets the Americans are ill - equipped to enter .

The claim was never well founded; but every passing month of Japan's recession suggests that there is now a new way to divide the rich industrial economies into different camps. There is the Anglo-Saxon type--suffering from a hangover after a boom and bust in stock and property markets, laden with consumer debts and dispirited by falling asset prices.

But in the first camp can be found the most unlikely tent-fellows: America, Britain and, yes, Japan.
Japanese will find this parallel with the United States and Britain just as uncomfortable as Americans will. It is painful for such a gravity-defying over-achiever now to be associated with a pair that Japanese have long considered to be yesterday's men. Yet the parallel holds: the financial strains that made the American and British recessions so long and demoralising are present in abundance in Japan. And it holds important clues for the likely pattern of the country's recovery. Japan's recession is lagging two years or more behind those in Britain and America; so too will its recovery, which when it finally gets under way is likely to be slow, uncertain and fragile.
Into this slough of despond plopped this week another depressing and rather Anglo-Saxon event: the bankruptcy of Muramoto Construction, a firm based in western Japan with debts thought (see page 101) to total Y600 billion ($5.6 billion), making it Japan's biggest bankruptcy in modern times. Muramoto was brought down by speculative investments gone bad because of the property bust, and a general decline in construction orders. A political scandal surrounding the whole construction industry has added spice, with firms accused of bribing scores of politicians. And alongside the collapse of a company and the disgrace of an industry, an old Japanese assumption--that a firm's main bank will provide a safety net to avert bankruptcy--has been called into doubt.
On the face of it, this bankruptcy appears to indicate further troubles ahead: more property collapses, more dud loans, and perhaps what Americans call a ""double-dip"" recession. More of likely, though, it is a sin of health. Although Muramoto's collapse does show that the patience of main banks is shorter than it was, this is chiefly a sign of a new willingness to own up to the size of dud loans--which, in turn, is a clue that the volume of those dud loans has stopped growing. For two years, there has been a huge gap between the absurdly low official reports of bad loans held by Japanese banks and the frighteningly high unofficial guesses of their size. Today the figures are convening. Speculative guesswork now revolves around a figure of Y30 trillion, down from as much as Y50 trillion. Official figures seem to be doubling to around Y15 trillion. In Japan such honesty does not signify a new ethical mood, but rather a new confidence that things are under control.
SLOW AND STEADY, WITH SOME HELP FROM THE TAXMAN
In time, that confidence among financial regulators and bankers will take hold among ordinary Japanese as well. But it will take time. After rising by more than 4% a year in 1985-90, private consumption has been falling, pushed down by poor income growth and a renewed desire to stash money away for rainy days. That, along with depressed corporate investment, is how the financial economy has been transmitted into real recession: hence the likelihood that Japan's GDP will show zero growth in 1993 as a whole.
The big difference between Japan and the other Anglo-Saxon economies is that it has ample fiscal resources to spare. It has used them to good effect: three public-works packages in the past two years have doubled the growth rate of government investment and probably rescued the economy from severe shrinkage. The prime minister, Morihiro Hosokawa, now hints of a further boost, through a cut in income tax to be clawed back in later years by raising sales taxes. This would be welcome: it would make a badly needed shift of taxation from income to expenditure while putting money in the most useful spot: the consumer's wallet. But too much should not be expected of it. Tax cut or not, recovery is likely to be slow, given that consumers, banks and companies remain weighed down with debt. Such is the lot of the Anglo-Saxon economy.","It used to be claimed, notably in America, that there were two types of capitalist economy: Japan, and everyone else.

This missile may not be able to deliver the primitive kind of nuclear bomb that the North Koreans may come up with. Yet even the prospect of a clumsy nuclear weapon in an unstable dictator's hands is scary: it is prompting talk of UN sanctions, and of developing an anti-missile shield.
Japan is ambivalent about both these measures. Many Korean immigrants in Japan sympathise with North Korea, and support it with regular sack-loads of hard currency. UN sanctions might require Japan's government to cut off that flow. This would be awkward: Japan's leaders feel guilty about their predecessors' harsh treatment of Korean immigrants, which has also harmed relations with South Korea.
An anti-missile shield raises different worries. In September the Americans invited Japan to help develop a sort of mini Star Wars programme: satellites would detect the launch of North Korean missiles, which could then be shot down. (Unlike Ronald Reagan's Star Wars idea, however, this shield would be land-based and provide protection against shortish-range missiles.) The Japanese have not so far responded, partly out of reluctance to share with America their civilian technologies. The Americans have also offered to develop the shield without Japanese help and then to sell Japan the result. The Japanese have not accepted that either, because some reckon that a jointly operated defence system would infringe Japan's pacifist constitution.
Japan has one of the world's biggest defence budgets, and its well-equipped armed forces are 238,000-strong. But these forces, according to a strict interpretation of the constitution, exist only for the defence of Japan, not for protecting other countries. By sending non-combat troops to Cambodia, Japan has half-accepted the idea of ""collective security"" under the UN's leadership. But Japan's doves have yet to accept ""collective defence"", which they say is different.
As well as protecting Japan, a missile shield would probably cover South Korea, including American troops based there. Japan's left-wing Social Democratic Party, which is part of the ruling coalition, therefore argues that the shield would be unconstitutional. In 1969 the Diet (parliament) passed a resolution against the militarisation of space; the Social Democrats cite this as a further obstacle to Japan's participation in the Americans' proposal.
Other coalition members reckon Japan needs to beef up its defences, even though it is already adding warships fitted with anti-missile systems to its land-based Patriot anti-missile missiles. In time, the shield's proponents may well prevail, since they include the bureaucrats in the defence agency; besides, the Social Democrats are a waning force. For the moment, however, the coalition is struggling with political reform and a depressed economy. Argument about the shield may therefore be put off.
On November 1st the coalition did resolve another defence issue: it agreed to support a bill that would permit the army to evacuate Japanese citizens from trouble spots in other countries. This sounds harmless--the bill lays down the troops engaged on such missions should be equipped only with hand guns--but it may mean strengthening Japan's ability to project power abroad.
Japan is already buying fewer tanks and other machinery designed to resist a Russian invasion. Instead, it plans to stock up on amphibious landing craft; other modernisations, such as mid-air refuelling equipment, may follow.

Demonstrators burned effigies of the Japanese emperor when Kiichi Miyazawa came to Seoul a couple of years ago. But his successor, Morihiro Hosokawa, has contained the troublesome issue of ""comfort women"", by apologising to the women forced into prostitution by Japanese soldiers during the second world war and talking of compensation. That helped make the meeting of the two countries' leaders on November 5th unusually harmonious.
The two men have a lot in common. Mr Hosokawa heads the first Japanese government in 38 years not to be dominated by the Liberal Democratic Party. Kim Young Sam, South Korea's president, leads the first civilian government for 32 years. Both draw their strength from their popular appeal. Both have vowed to reform their politics and deregulate their economies.
There is nothing new in the two countries pursuing similar agendas: for the past four decades, South Korea has been follow in the Japanese model of economic development. What is new is that South Korea has now taken the lead on political reform and deregulation, Mr Kim has already travelled some way down the route that Mr Hosokawa is just starting on.
The scale of corruption and thus the size of the task ahead was grander in Korea than in Japan. But Mr Kim's determination has startled even the most optimistic commentators. To prove his sincerity, he has opened his personal finances to public scrutiny. He has outlawed the false-name bank accounts used to hide ill-gotten cash. To make it harder for politicians to take bribes, he has promised to impose ceilings on election spending. And he has launched a purge that has seen over 1,000 senior officials officially reprimanded, sacked or jailed. A Japanese politician visiting Seoul earlier this year is said to have asked if he could borrow the ""reform patent"" for use at home.
Deregulation requires as radicals change in economic management and bureaucratic minds in South Korea as in Japan, for Korean rulers have emulated the Japanese model of ""partnership"" between government and business. Korea's military strongman Park Chung Hee used Japan's 19th-century modernisation drive as a blueprint for his own economic programme. In the 1980s his successor, Chun Doo Hwan, consciously copied the Japanese ""income doubling plan"" of the 1960s. So South Korea now has massive diversified conglomerates with interlocking shareholdings, preferential financing for ""strategic"" industries and an economic bureaucracy that thinks it knows everything.
The Japanese have proudly likened their neighbors' emulation of their economic model to a flock of geese flying in a V-shape behind the leader. Now that Japan is sunk in recession, the Koreans are still learning but from Japan's mistakes. ""The Japanese economy has grown too complex to be directed by bureaucrats,"" says Young Soo-gil, of the Korean Economic Planning Board, ""which is perhaps why it has not been doing so well of late."" The solution, says an official in the president's office, is ""to let firms make decisions on purely economic grounds, rather than waiting for the government to tell them what to do.""
The government has already taken one big step in the direction of deregulation. As of November 1st, banks may charge whatever interest rates they like. Previously the government had held rates artificially low to provide low-cost capital for favoured firms. This aim was achieved, but at the cost of sharply limiting the supply of funds to small firms.
Mr Kim has promised that taxes will be cut and that government will withdraw from business. Twenty-three government-controlled businesses, including the Korean Electric Power Corporation, are to be privatised, along with 99 of their subsidiaries. Retailing and wholesaling are to be liberalised: a programme is under way to wrest from the regulators the domestic sale of all goods except art, antiques and grains (rice, as in Japan, is a touchy subject).
South Korea still has trade restrictions galore, but they are coming down. To celebrate Mr Hosokawa's visit, the number of Japanese goods banned from South Korea was slashed in half; but the list, which includes cars, is still as long as your arm. A law now going through parliament will allow foreigners to own land in South Korea.
Anticipating bureaucratic resistance, Mr Kim is going slower on deregulation than on anti-corruption. The retailing reforms, for instance, are expected to take until 1997 to implement fully. Yet Mr Hosokawa may have been impressed by Mr Kim's momentum. On his return, he took a step towards fulfilling his promises to deregulate Japan's economy, announcing action may be another story-that 475 regulations would be loosened or lifted.","Previous visits to South Korea by Japanese prime ministers have not always gone well .

Korea 's military strongman Park Chung Hee used Japan 's 19th - century modernisation drive as a blueprint for his own economic programme . In the 1980s his successor , Chun Doo Hwan , consciously copied the Japanese "" income doubling plan "" of the 1960s . So South Korea now has massive diversified conglomerates with interlocking shareholdings , preferential financing for "" strategic "" industries and an economic bureaucracy that thinks it knows everything . 
 The Japanese have proudly likened their neighbors ' emulation of their economic model to a flock of geese flying in a V - shape behind the leader . Now that Japan is sunk in recession , the Koreans are still learning but from Japan 's mistakes . "" The Japanese economy has grown too complex to be directed by bureaucrats , "" says Young Soo - gil , of the Korean Economic Planning Board , "" which is perhaps why it has not been doing so well of late . "" The solution , says an official in the president 's office , is "" to let firms make decisions on purely economic grounds , rather than waiting for the government to tell them what to do . "" 
 The government has already taken one big step in the direction of deregulation . As of November 1st , banks may charge whatever interest rates they like . Previously the government had held rates artificially low to provide low - cost capital for favoured firms . This aim was achieved , but at the cost of sharply limiting the supply of funds to small firms . 
 Mr Kim has promised that taxes will be cut and that government will withdraw from business . Twenty - three government - controlled businesses , including the Korean Electric Power Corporation , are to be privatised , along with 99 of their subsidiaries . Retailing and wholesaling are to be liberalised : a programme is under way to wrest from the regulators the domestic sale of all goods except art , antiques and grains ( rice , as in Japan , is a touchy subject ) . 
 South Korea still has trade restrictions galore , but they are coming down . To celebrate Morihito Hosokawa's visit , the number of Japanese goods banned from South Korea was slashed in half ; but the list , which includes cars , is still as long as your arm . A law now going through parliament will allow foreigners to own land in South Korea . 
 Anticipating bureaucratic resistance , Mr Kim is going slower on deregulation than on anti - corruption . The retailing reforms , for instance , are expected to take until 1997 to implement fully . Yet Morihito Hosokawa may have been impressed by Mr Kim 's momentum . On Morihito Hosokawa's return , Morihito Hosokawa took a step towards fulfilling Morihito Hosokawa's promises to deregulate Japan 's economy , announcing action may be another story - that 475 regulations would be loosened or lifted .",740,Japan,A29-8188,IN TERM,True,Mr Hosokawa,8,True

Lesser figures than Ichiro Ozawa might have been fazed by this embarrassment. But the fixer behind Japan's coalition government calmly cites his own conduct as proof of the need for tighter rules on campaign finance. It is this kind of brazenness that makes Mr Ozawa both influential and hated.
On November 5th newspapers reported that a vice president of Kajima, Japan's biggest construction company, claimed to have given Mr Ozawa Y5m ($46,300) on more than one occasion. The legal limit on political donations is Y1.5m. Mr Ozawa argues that the contributions were technically legal. This implies that the money was divided into smaller, legal parcels and distributed among Mr Ozawa's many fund-raising organisations.
Legal or not, the contributions hardly respected the spirit of the campaign finance laws. Nor does Mr Ozawa's refusal to explain what precisely happened to the money respect the spirit of his own pronouncements. In a recent book, he says that the flow of funds should be made ""totally transparent"".
Japan's coalition government is currently pushing for laws that would restrict political donations further, tether with ones that would shake up the electoral system. The Liberal Democratic Party, which lost power in August after 38 years in office, sees in the Ozawa case a chance to frustrate reform of a system that it feels comfortable with. On November 5th the LDP suggested a ""thorough"" debate on the scandals, which would involve testimony from construction-ministry executives. Mr Ozawa might also be called upon to give evidence.
A long debate on the construction scandals, which have led so far to the arrest of four provincial politicians and some 20 construction-company managers would delay progress on political reform. The prime minister, Morihiro Hosokawa, has promised to get the bills through the lower house of parliament by the middle of November. He therefore needs to scotch the LDP call for a debate. Unfortunately, the LDP has some unusual supporters.
These include the Japan Communist Party, another opposition group that stands to lose from reform of the electoral system. Within the governing coalition, the Social Democratic Party may prove sympathetic. Its electoral support is waning; a partial shift to first-past-the-post elections, which the reform would bring, would accelerate its loss of influence. Until now, the Social Democrats have kept these worries quiet. But the tarnishing of the coalition's most determined advocate of reform may give them a chance to scupper the whole reform.","The prime mover in an anti - corruption drive is himself accused of taking questionable campaign cash .

An effective vaccine, combined with a systematically organised programme of inoculation had, for the first time, eliminated a lethal disease from the face of the earth.
What could be done once could, it was assumed, be done again. The Expanded Programme on Immunisation (EPI) that WHO announced in the warm after-glow of its success with smallpox had six diseases in its unsights: measles, diphtheria, whooping cough, tetanus, tuberculosis and polio. Like smallpox, there were effective vaccines against each of them. Like smallpox, all were big killers of children.
Unfortunately, 16 years later, they still are. The campaign has not exactly failed--80% of the world's children have been immunised and many lives saved. But it has not succeeded, either. Its geographical reach is patchy, particularly in the poorest parts of the world, where disease is most likely to result in death. Even in rich countries, measles and whooping cough still linger. Many in the field now believe that another approach is needed. A new set of initials has been muscling its way in. The Children's Vaccine Initiative (CVI) started in 1990 with a different set of parents (ranging from the Rockefeller Foundation to the World Bank, and with only minority participation by WHO) and a different strategy.
A few days ago, at a conference in Kyoto, WHO threw in the towel. Hiroshi Nakajima, its head, conceded the limitations of the EPI and agreed to merge the initiative's resources and programme with the CVI by January 1994. Good news for the CVI. In 1992 it managed to attract only $100m-worth of investment, while $1 billion was spent financing the EPI. Moreover, the Japanese, in the shape of Kayoko Hosokawa, the prime minister's wife, agreed to try and rustle up an additional $300m of voluntary contributions by 2000.
The difference between the EPI and the CVI is the difference between the office and the laboratory. Inspired by the smallpox campaign, the EPI concentrated on delivery. It was effective bureaucracy, as much as anything, that dispatched that pox. But administering six vaccines in parallel has proved rather trickier. The numbers are daunting. To attack all six diseases with the best vaccines around in 1977 required five visits to a clinic during the first 15 months of a baby's life--awkward to arrange even in ideal conditions.
Having set up their bureaucracy, WHO officials found it hard to accommodate new and better vaccines that turned up. These would have had to be administered on different schedules, and it was difficult to change horses in mid-stream. In remote, tropical areas there was a further problem. Many vaccines dislike the heat. They have to be transported from refrigerator to refrigerator in cooled flasks. One break in such a ""cold chain"" spells doom.
In contrast, the CVI is concentrating on developing new vaccines. Those in charge feel that the problems of administration would melt away if simpler, more robust inoculations were available. The goal is to create a combined vaccine against all six diseases (and, with luck, one or two others that WHO originally avoided worrying about). Ideally, the new vaccine would be given as a single dose, by mouth, shortly after birth. It also would be unaffected by changing temperatures. Most of all it would be affordable.
This is a tall order. Whether it is taller than rejigging the administrative approach to the problem remains to be seen, but some, at least, of the technical difficulties are being tackled. Vaccines work by showing the body's immune system critical pieces (known as antigens) of disease-inducing bugs so that if the real thing comes along it can respond much faster. If bits of different organisms are lumped together in a single vaccine in order to reduce the number of shots, it may confuse the response. Also, to obtain full protection, several shots are sometimes needed. The optimum gap between these varies from vaccine to vaccine. Both of these difficulties, and the problem of the cold chain, were addressed at Kyoto.
To deliver a combination of vaccines scientists are looking at ways of getting the body to do some of the work for them. Instead of injecting large amounts of a single antigen, they hope to insert small amounts of several, and to let them multiply. A good way to do this is to splice genes for the antigens into a virus that can breed in people without harming them. That way, you get a lot of antigen for your vaccine. A popular choice as the carrier is the canary-pox virus. This belongs to the same family as smallpox and, because it is large by viral standards, has room on board for the odd foreign gene. But although the injected viruses can reproduce in people's bodies, their progeny are incomplete, and cannot. So enough antigens are produced to provoke a response without causing illness.
Virogenetics, a biotechnology company based in Troy, New York, is testing canary-pox-based vaccines (against measles, rabies and even AIDS) on people. At the moment, each vaccine-virus contains only one extra gene, but the company hopes to start proving its multi-gene technology next year, by testing a vaccine against malaria. Though malaria was not on the original hit-list, it is also a big killer and its complex life-cycle presents different antigens at different stages. Virogenetics's vaccine will include seven different antigens and provide a stepping-stone to something that can safeguard against different diseases simultaneously.
The other obstacle to an all-purpose, one-shot vaccine--the need for repeated doses--is being tackled with timed-release capsules. The vaccine is encased in tiny spheres made of different biodegradable plastics. Like a 24-hour cold cure, the capsule casings dissolve at different rates and liberate their contents at different times. The CVI is sponsoring a number of groups around the world that are using this approach to tackle neonatal tetanus. This disease results from careless cutting of the umbilical cord, particularly if animal dun is around. Mothers-to-be can be immunised, and the immunity passed to their babies, but five shots are required for full protection. The hope is to reduce this to a single jab.
The problem of the cold chain is also under attack. One of the most heat-susceptible vaccines is polio. A pity, because polio is widely reckoned to be the disease most likely to follow smallpox into oblivion. Like smallpox, it can live only in people. Clear it from the human population and it is gone for good. Yuri Ghendon, a Russian working at WHO, recently stumbled on a curious fact. If polio vaccine is made with heavy water (which has heavier than normal hydrogen atoms linked to its oxygen), instead of the ordinary stuff, it appears to be more resistant to heat. Stan Lemon, and a group of researchers from the University of North Carolina and the Pasteur Institute in Paris, are trying to find out why. Heavy water's main use at the moment is to slow down the neutrons that fly around inside nuclear reactors. It would be delightful if it could slow down disease as well.","In 1977 the World Health Organisation (WHO) could have been forgiven a little arrogance: it had just exterminated smallpox.

Few people have felt inclined to challenge Morihiro Hosokawa's own description of the eight-party coalition that he leads. When he took over as Japan's prime minister in July, he seemed to have little chance of survival, and less of reforming his country. Yet his touching description of his own vulnerability now sounds more modest than accurate. On November 18th Mr Hosokawa pushed through the lower house of the Diet four bills destined to reform Japan's political system. His government is starting to look not just as though it can stay afloat, but as though it may be able to deliver some of the goods entrusted to it when it set sail.
This is just the impression that Mr Hosokawa intended to create for his arrival at the APEC summit on November 18th. He had set the date of his departure for Seattle as the deadline for getting his political reforms through their first stage, knowing that a Japanese government looking strong at home had a greater chance of fulfilling its ambition to take a diplomatic lead abroad.
Mr Hosokawa has won his success at home through a cunning combination of old and new. His slightly vacuous air suggests a politician of the old school, free of any strong views. Yet this seems to be camouflage to conceal a moderniser's clear opinions and determination. Tradition dictates that consensus must precede change in Japan, so Mr Hosokawa struggled for two months to get the opposition Liberal Democratic Party to agree to his reforms. When it would not, he pushed them through regardless. His moderate radicalism has won him unprecedented popularity--70% of voters approve of him--which has persuaded doubtful coalition partners that they cannot afford to oppose his reforms. Now that they are through the lower house, the upper house is unlikely to be obstructive.
The bills are important in themselves. They will replace Japan's system of multi-member constituencies, blamed for encouraging political corruption, with a combination of single-member seats and proportional representation. They also provide for Y30.9 billion ($290m) a year in public money for the parties. They are, however, just one part of the general reform that Mr Hosokawa wants to bring about. He now faces a harder battle--to wrest control of the economy from the bureaucrats. That is closely connected to his struggle to persuade other countries that the Japanese are fair traders who do not deserve to be punished by sanctions.
The surest way of both weakening the bureaucrats and undermining foreigners' grounds for complaint would be to deregulate the economy. The trouble is that civil servants' power is slippery stuff for a prime minister to get his hands on. When, in September, Mr Hosokawa asked the bureaucrats who implement the 10,942 regulations that apply to private business to suggest some that might be lifted, they came up with 94. A commission he had set up did only a little better when it reported this month; it suggested 475 regulations that should, it thought, be loosened or lifted.
Still, Mr Hosokawa has at least made plain his intentions, and not everything is going the bureaucrats' way. The prime minister, along with the foreign governments who want Japanese consumers to buy more of their goods, has been arguing for a tax cut. The finance ministry has been resisting, pointing to three public-spending packages, worth Y30 trillion, in the past 15 months, all designed to stimulate economic growth. But the economy's failure to pull itself out of recession--no growth is expected in Japan this year--has argued otherwise. A 5 trillion tax cut is expected to be implemented in January.

The strength of the yen is also helping to bring about some of the changes that foreigners and reform-minded Japanese have been demanding. Some rebellious Japanese retailers are turning against their traditional sources and buying abroad. Japanese shoppers are getting used to snapping up imported food at a fraction of the price of the home-produced stuff, and finding it edible. Since consumers' conservatism has been partly responsible for keeping foreign goods off the market, getting rid of old habits may be as useful as getting rid of old rules.
The impact of the high yen is beginning to show up in the figures. In yen terms, Japan's trade surplus is falling; in time the dollar surplus is likely to start falling too. But the Americans are not minded to give the Japanese much time. In October the United States made, then withdrew, a threat to impose sanctions unless American companies were given a bigger share of Japanese government contracts. It may lose patience even with Mr Hosokawa if Japan does not have something to offer on several fronts by February, when the trade talks between the two countries are due to finish.
The best way for Japan to discourage bilateral bullying would be to offer trade concessions to the GATT's Uruguay round--on rice, beef and financial services, for instance--before the December 15th deadline for a deal. That would take the heat off talks with America, impress upon other Asian countries that Japan can lead them in the struggle to keep the world's markets open and give GATT a better chance of survival. If, in Seattle, Mr Hosokawa demurs, pleading the domestic difficulty of pushing through trade reform, he will not sound all that convincing. For he has proved, with his political reforms, that he is good at doing difficult things.",""" A boat with eight captains heading out into a storm . "" Few people have felt inclined to challenge Morihito Hosokawa's own description of the eight - party coalition that Morihito Hosokawa leads . When Morihito Hosokawa took over as Japan 's prime minister in July , Morihito Hosokawa seemed to have little chance of survival , and less of reforming Morihito Hosokawa's country . Yet Morihito Hosokawa's touching description of Morihito Hosokawa's own vulnerability now sounds more modest than accurate . On November 18th Morihito Hosokawa pushed through the lower house of the Diet four bills destined to reform Japan 's political system . Morihito Hosokawa's government is starting to look not just as though it can stay afloat , but as though it may be able to deliver some of the goods entrusted to it when it set sail . 
 This is just the impression that Morihito Hosokawa intended to create for Morihito Hosokawa's arrival at the APEC summit on November 18th . Morihito Hosokawa had set the date of Morihito Hosokawa's departure for Seattle as the deadline for getting Morihito Hosokawa's political reforms through their first stage , knowing that a Japanese government looking strong at home had a greater chance of fulfilling its ambition to take a diplomatic lead abroad . 
 Morihito Hosokawa has won Morihito Hosokawa's success at home through a cunning combination of old and new . Morihito Hosokawa's slightly vacuous air suggests a politician of the old school , free of any strong views . Yet this seems to be camouflage to conceal a moderniser 's clear opinions and determination . Tradition dictates that consensus must precede change in Japan , so Morihito Hosokawa struggled for two months to get the opposition Liberal Democratic Party to agree to Morihito Hosokawa's reforms . When it would not , Morihito Hosokawa pushed them through regardless . Morihito Hosokawa's moderate radicalism has won Morihito Hosokawa unprecedented popularity--70 % of voters approve of Morihito Hosokawa -- which has persuaded doubtful coalition partners that they can not afford to oppose Morihito Hosokawa's reforms . Now that they are through the lower house , the upper house is unlikely to be obstructive . 
 The bills are important in themselves . They will replace Japan 's system of multi - member constituencies , blamed for encouraging political corruption , with a combination of single - member seats and proportional representation . They also provide for Y30.9 billion ( $ 290 m ) a year in public money for the parties . They are , however , just one part of the general reform that Morihito Hosokawa wants to bring about . Morihito Hosokawa now faces a harder battle -- to wrest control of the economy from the bureaucrats . That is closely connected to Morihito Hosokawa's struggle to persuade other countries that the Japanese are fair traders who do not deserve to be punished by sanctions . 
 The surest way of both weakening the bureaucrats and undermining foreigners ' grounds for complaint would be to deregulate the economy . The trouble is that civil servants ' power is slippery stuff for a prime minister to get his hands on . When , in September , Morihito Hosokawa asked the bureaucrats who implement the 10,942 regulations that apply to private business to suggest some that might be lifted , they came up with 94 . A commission Morihito Hosokawa had set up did only a little better when it reported this month ; it suggested 475 regulations that should , it thought , be loosened or lifted . 
 Still , Morihito Hosokawa has at least made plain Morihito Hosokawa's intentions , and not everything is going the bureaucrats ' way . Morihito Hosokawa , along with the foreign governments who want Japanese consumers to buy more of their goods , has been arguing for a tax cut . The finance ministry has been resisting , pointing to three public - spending packages , worth Y30 trillion , in the past 15 months , all designed to stimulate economic growth . But the economy 's failure to pull itself out of recession -- no growth is expected in Japan this year -- has argued otherwise . A 5 trillion tax cut is expected to be implemented in January .

This town in Hokkaido, Japan's northernmost island, grew up around its coal mines. From the 1960s, however, Yubari's coal was priced out of its markets by cheaper imports. The local people were told they had to find another way to earn their livelihood: they chose, of all things, melons. Their story shows how ill-prepared parts of Japan are for the shocks in store for them.
In winter Yubari's soil freezes hard. The town is closer to Siberia than to its customers in Tokyo. Despite such adversity, and with the help of some clever species-crossing, Yubari's melon farmers have grown famous. Tokyoites pay Y10,000 ($92) for a lavishly packaged melon. Collectively, Yubari's melon-growers sell Y4.5 billion worth of fruit a year.
In Hokkaido's capital, Sapporo, the prefectural government's economic planners offer this tale as a triumph of resourceful adaptation. Yet a visit to the agriculture section of Yubari's town hall, where the boss wears slippers and does his sums on an abacus, suggests a different interpretation. After rummaging in several files, an official declares that the melon men get Y1 billion a year in subsidies. Without these, the resourceful farmers would go bust.
The reformist government of Morihiro Hosokawa promises to cut back the state's role in the economy. One rough estimate by the Japan Research Institute, Sumitomo Bank's research arm, suggests that such a shift, combined with the tariff cuts that Japan's trading partners are demanding, might force 4.1m workers, 6.2% of Japan's total, out of their existing jobs. In Hokkaido, the upheaval would be more devastating.
The prefectural government is full of ambitious melon-style projects. For the most part, it betrays little sign of considering the return on its investments. The public spending accounts for some 24.5% of Hokkaido's GDP, compared with an average for Japan as a whole of 15.7%. Despite this public help, Hokkaido managed real GNP growth of only 2.6% a year in the 1980s. Japan as a whole grew at 4.1%.
In 1987 Takahiro Yokomichi, Hokkaido's popular governor, announced that, given the region's failure to develop an industrial foundation, he would start building a post-industrial one immediately. To this end, the governor set up an air base for rockets to land on. Small rockets are launched and crashed to measure the effect of collisions. But Japan has not yet dispatched the shuttle that Hokkaido's base is intended for. There are no plans to launch it soon.
High-tech research is another of Mr. Yokomichi's melons. In 1987 there were plans to build a Y1 trillion medical centre specialising in artificial organs. This found few private-sector backers, so for the moment the project remains on the drawing-board.
Mr. Yokomichi is also keen on transport. Last year Hokkaido's airport got a spanking new terminal building costing Y60 billion. A second runway is being built, and the governor is negotiating with locals to allow cargo aircraft to land at night. A new quarantine centre makes it possible to import livestock directly, rather than through Tokyo's chock-a-block Narita airport.
The result? Cargo handled at the airport, measured by volume, fell 5.2% in the year to March. True, this reflects Japan's recession. But volumes would have to expand vastly to justify the government's investment. Plans to make Hokkaido a hub for passenger flights are not doing much better: just four foreign airlines land at the airport. New airports near Seoul and Osaka are competing for regional business.
Less ambitious schemes have also faltered. During the 1980s, Japan's population grew by a tenth, but Hokkaido's was stagnant. To discourage depopulation, the prefectural government tried to foster cottage industries. But the official in charge admits that a decade of such subsidies has failed to stop migration. She cites another scheme: the prefecture runs an office in Tokyo that seeks Hokkaido jobs for people pining for the country. In three years, only 550 city-dwellers have been resettled.
Agriculture is reputedly efficient in Hokkaido. Local farmers do not rely on the doomed business of growing rice that costs several times world prices. The island now has large dairy farms. Mr. Yokomichi greets visitors with a hearty glass of milk, and Tokyo's supermarkets stock Hokkaido camembert. Yet, asked to name the most promising development on local farms, prefectural officials cite a three-year plan to expand Hokkaido's paddy fields by a quarter.
This suggests more than Hokkaido's failure to anticipate trade liberalisation; it shows how badly it needs it. Hokkaido's farmers are switching back to rice because, so long as Japan's market is closed, it pays them to do so. Meanwhile Japan's protectionism, by keeping the yen high, is suffocating industries that might make sense in Hokkaido.
Hokkaido ought to be an attractive base for Japan's manufacturers. Labour is plentiful and therefore cheap: Hokkaido's manufacturing wages are about three-fifths of those in the Tokyo area, a tribute to Japan's efficient labour market. The price of land in Sapporo is about 10-20% of that near Tokyo. But, thanks to the appreciation of the yen, Hokkaido remains off-puttingly expensive by comparison with other parts of Asia.
If Mr. Hosokawa's government brings in trade liberalisation and deregulation, Japan's imports may increase their share of GDP from their present 7% towards the 14.6% that is the OECD average. If less than half that gap were closed, Japan's trade surplus would vanish and the yen would probably fall. Hokkaido might then attract the industries that the high yen is now driving out of Japan. Deregulation should eventually bring such rewards, but the transition will be tough.","It is hard to decide whether Yubari 's visionaries are heroic or mad .

No-one in Washington seriously expected Morihiro Hosokawa to bring hard promises of a fresh fiscal stimulus that America has long wished would suck more imports into Japan. That country's prime minister will have returned home with more bounce in his step. Even more so when what the Clinton administration has done to its weak-dollar, strong-yen policy really sinks in. It has turned it about-face.
The government will strenuously deny that its policy has changed, just as it denied that it had been talking the dollar down in mid-August when a surprise intervention by the Federal Reserve hiked the dollar sharply against the yen. At that time the American currency looked likely to drop below Y100; since then it has strengthened by 8% to more than Y108.
That the dollar is gaining ground has less to do with what Washington wants it to do than with America's economic recovery. Though there is no sign yet of inflationary pressures, the bond markets have been rattled by the prospect that strong economic growth (perhaps 4% or more in the fourth quarter, at an annualised rate) might force the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates next year. After dipping below 6%, the yield on long-term Treasury bonds has leapt to 6.38%. The OECD's annual report on America says that it expects the federal-funds rate, at which the central bank provides liquidity to the banking system, to rise from the 3% at which it has for so long been held to 5% by the end of next year. Meanwhile, a stagnating Japanese economy seems to call for further monetary easing.
What is interesting is that the Clinton administration is now unruffled by the stronger dollar, and (its officials suggest) may well not worry until the currency approaches Y115. Few of its economists had expected Japan's economy to stay in recession for so long. The newly prevailing view is that the world economy can no longer afford to have tugboat Japan beached by a strong yen.
Such a view, given Washington's usual taste for cheap dollars and cheap exports, would be unthinkable were it not for the administration's faith that Japan is about to embark on momentous economic reforms. The line, simply put, is this. The Japanese prime minister is a crusader, but with a minority coalition government. Give him time to solidify his support; then watch taxes fall, public spending rise and trade be liberalised. Yet some American officials have despaired recently at the opposition of officials in the Japanese finance ministry to tax reductions and higher spending.
The dollar may still climb through all this discord, just as it could strengthen further against the D-mark (see chart on previous page). (Chart omitted) Another reason for American equanimity is that some officials think a rising dollar could improve the prospects for a successful outcome to the Uruguay round of GATT negotiations. A weaker D-mark might ease pressure on the franc, rendering Franco-German harmony likelier as Europe plays out its end-game in the talks.
What could upset the dollar against the yen, however, is renewed trade friction between America and Japan. Such tensions are closer to the surface than meets the public eye. On February 11th the leaders of the two countries are to meet, largely to set the seal on bilateral trade talks agreed upon last summer by Mr Clinton and Mr Hosokawa's predecessor. These so-called ""framework"" talks, which have been going on since early autumn, are meant to produce clear evidence that Japan is committed to more open markets in, among other things, government procurement, insurance, cars and car parts. They are also meant to spur domestic financial liberalisation. Though officials claim the opposite, talks on the latter point; at least, are going nowhere.","If you listen to Bill Clinton 's senior spokespeople , all was rosy between America and Japan as Morihito Hosokawa's returned from Morihito Hosokawa's Asia - Pacific Economic Co - operation hug - in in Seattle .

Keith Whitson, an old HSBC hand, will become chief executive at Midland in place of Brian Pearse, who was expected to become chairman but will now retire. Sir William Purves, chairman of HSBC, will take that job at Midland too, replacing Sir Peter Walters.
Italy's biggest financial restructuring was set in motion. Ferruzzi, the country's second-largest privately owned group, persuaded most of its bankers and shareholders to agree to a plan to restructure 16.2 trillion lire ($9.5 billion) of the group's 30 trillion lire debt. Shareholders also approved plans for legal action against the group's auditors, Price Waterhouse, for failing to spot huge holes in its accounts.
Merrett Holdings, the fifth-biggest agency in Lloyd's of London, was forced to pull out of insurance underwriting. A market leader in certain classes of maritime and non-maritime risks, Merrett could not attract enough capital from Lloyd's names or new corporate investors to stay in business.
There was anger among investors, politicians and City regulators at the mild sentence meted out to Roger Levitt, who pleaded guilty to one fraud charge after his Levitt Group collapsed with huge debts. After being told to do 180 hours of community service, Mr Levitt said he was ""a great believer in British justice"".
ON YOUR MARKS
Days after the British government said it would change rules to allow independent television companies to own two broadcasting licences, Carlton Communications made an agreed bid of L624m ($925m) for the 80% of Central Independent Television it did not already own. The merger will create Britain's biggest ITV company.
After a courtship lasting several years, Daimler-Benz of Germany and Japan's Mitsubishi Corp signed a set of agreements in Berlin that range from joint ventures to common arrangements for recycling metals and plastics in their products.
The 60-bank syndicate to which Euro Disney owes most of its debts plans to get a fresh audit of the leisure group's finances before discussions of an emergency financial restructuring. The group lost FFr5.3 billion ($960m) in the year to end-September, the first year that Euro Disneyland has been in operation.
Ferranti, a defence-electronics company, called in the receivers after GEC, Britain's biggest manufacturing company, pulled out of a plan to rescue the group.
The Bombay Stock Exchange closed for a day after the death of J.R.D. Tata, 89, the founder of India's largest business group. He headed Tata for more than 50 years and was regarded as one of the country's most influential businessmen.
DOWNHILL
The proposed merger between Sweden's Volvo and France's Renault ran into seemingly insurmountable difficulties, as several big shareholders came out against it and Volvo appeared to suffer a boardroom split.
Volkswagen said it expects a group loss for 1993 of DM2 billion ($1.2 billion), compared with a profit last year of DM147m. It did not say when it might return to profit. A shortened version of an auditors' report failed to clear Jose Ignacio Lopez of allegations of industrial espionage that have soured relations between VW and General Motors' German subsidiary, Opel.

On November 29th the Nikkei 225 share average tumbled 3.9%, completing a series of falls that had brought it 24% down from this year's peak in September. Over the next three days, the Nikkei bravely got up again, rising by 8.6%. How many more falls before little Nikkei again walks confidently?
The answer depends, in the short run, on the behaviour of the nanny. The latest panic in Tokyo took hold as the reformist government of Morihiro Hosokawa declared that, unlike its predecessors, it did not believe in using public money to support the stockmarket. The government said that it would support the real economy instead, but it has been slow to do so. The impression of a weak leadership, distracted by the effort to enact political reforms, terrified investors.
This was exaggerated. On political reform, Mr Hosokawa has been surprisingly decisive. Price signals from the stockmarket--muffled in the past by promises of government intervention--are spurring Mr Hosokawa to economic action. The day after the market's 3.9% dive, the cabinet approved a Y708 billion ($6.5 billion) supplementary budget; and the prime minister declared himself in favour of a big cut in income tax in January.
Meanwhile, the Ministry of Finance summoned insurers for a chat about their investment policy; this may have included official encouragement to buy equities. On the same day the prime minister met Yoshihisa Tabuchi, the ex-boss of Nomura Securities whose continued influence over that firm makes him Japan's most powerful stockbroker. All this chivvying produced the desired rebound in share prices.
For the moment, the government still shrinks from ordering Japan's postal-savings funds to buy equities. This may reflect its declared belief in freer markets. Alternatively, the government may simply be waiting: companies are obliged to report losses on their equity portfolios at the end of the financial year in March, so that is when the temptation to support the market will be strongest.
AFTER THE WARRANTS
While the government's intentions remain unclear, investors are left to consider the market's fundamental value. Most Japanese investors are said to be pessimistic; given rock-bottom yields on domestic cash and bonds, they may prefer to invest abroad. Japan's economy is sick: figures released this week showed slumping output and rising unemployment in October, and most economists expect GDP to start growing, slightly, only next year. Some foreigners, however, see reason to buy shares. Fresh optimism has recently emerged about company profits.
During the first oil shock, hitherto Japan's worst post-war recession, the earnings per share of firms in the broad Topix index fell by 42%. The current drop is more severe. By next March consolidated earnings of Topix firms are likely to have fallen by some 70% from their peak in March 1989, according to Jason James, a strategist at James Capel, a stockbroking firm. Mr James thinks that things are now looking up. Warburg Securities, for its part, expects net profits of listed non-financial firms to jump 36% in the year from April 1994.
The style of management in Japanese firms makes a sharp profit rebound seem unlikely. In other rich countries, companies' costs tend to be harder to control in the early stages of a recession; but, when things get grim, managers make radical cuts by closing factories and sacking people. In Japan, by contrast, costs tend to be squeezed earlier on. Dramatic cuts, however, are deemed unacceptable.
As a result, Japan's non-financial companies have already tried hard to reduce the three-quarters of their costs that are classed as ""variable"". Sub-contractors, which account for a large share of quoted firms' output, have had their prices forced down. Employees are working less overtime; part-time workers have been dismissed. Investors have already had much of the benefit of this gradual squeeze. No sudden western-style cost-cutting lurks around the corner.
Accounting practices reinforce this gradualism. America's firms provide for the cost of restructuring early and all at once: net profits plunge when the provision is made, but subsequent recovery from an artificially low base can be sharp. Japanese firms, on the other hand, tend to absorb the costs of gradual restructuring as they go along. So there is no sudden bounce-back in profits.
Yet one big cost is set to come down sharply in Japan: the cost of money. In the past two years, although the Bank of Japan eased interest rates, firms' cost of capital went up, because they were refinancing the Y24 trillion of warrant-bonds (bonds with equity options that holders are not exercising because share prices are so low) they issued in 1987-91. Warrant expiries peaked this year at Y10 trillion, adding about Y300 billion-350 billion to listed firms' annual borrowing costs.
Next year, however, just half that volume must be refinanced. Meanwhile, falling interest rates are cutting the cost of bank loans. Expiring bonds with coupons of around 8% may next year be replaced with new paper yielding half that. On top of this, the cost of depreciating the investments financed by warrants is peaking. Quoted firms' depreciation costs are up by 2% in the current financial year; next year they are expected to fall by around 4%. Mr James reckons that listed firms' cost of borrowing may fall by more than Y1 trillion in the year from next April. To long-sighted investors, Japan's financial problems appear to be easing.","Untended by the nanny state , Tokyo 's stockmarket is about as steady as the average toddler .

Angered by American pressure to open their rice market, 25,000 South Korean farmers and sympathisers marched through the streets shouting ""Death to Kim Uncle Sam"" and beating with bamboo poles any whites foolish enough not to pretend to be French. Japan's farmers have been protesting too, but they tend to be better mannered.
Yet on December 9th South Korea's president, Kim Young Sam, braved the farmers' fury and went on television to announce that the country would lift its ban on rice imports. He explained that South Korea had to take this step to satisfy its GATT partners before the December 15th deadline. The alternative, he said, was ""isolation in international society"". Details will be announced soon. And within the next few days Japan's government is also expected to announce that it will let in foreign rice.
Not all that much, though. Japan's government appears ready to import a mere 4-8% of its rice for the rest of this century. If the deal sticks, after six years the Japanese will switch from quotas to tariffs; alternatively, they can increase the foreign quota to 10% or more and further delay the introduction of tariffs. South Korea may end up accepting the same deal, but it has been trying to hold out for a 3-5% limit on imports.
Until now both Japan and South Korea have been unbending in their determination to keep cheap foreign rice off their soil. They have argued that self-sufficiency in their staple food is essential to national security; that sticky rice glues together their respective cultures; that their increasingly urban economies have an obligation to country people.
Yet Japanese governments, while promising not to give in to foreign pressure, have been quietly preparing for an open market. Since 1980 government spending has jumped by two-thirds, but the allocation for rice has fallen by the same proportion. Meanwhile, the budget for direct support of the price of rice has shrunk by nearly half.
As a result, farmers no longer expect their rice to fetch ever higher sums. Whereas producer prices rose 5% between 1980 and 1985, they fell 6% over the next five years. That has encouraged Japan's shift away from farming, which was happening anyway as the young were drawn to the towns. In 1980, there were 4.7m farming households; in 1991, 3.8m.
South Korea has been arguing in GATT that it deserves more lenient treatment than Japan because more of its people will suffer. Some 6m Koreans, 14% of the population, are farmers (down from nearly half ten years ago). They are more likely than their Japanese counterparts to be full-time: only 30% of their income comes from other jobs, compared with over 80% in Japan.
Rice subsidies in South Korea have been rising steadily over the past decade. Next year, the government is to buy over a quarter of the rice crop at a price 5% higher than it paid this year. But longer-term plans to cut subisides, hinted at in this year's budget, have provoked strong reactions. In parliament last week, opposition MPs attacked the acting speaker, sending him to hospital and thus preventing (temporarily) the passage of the offending budget. The budget was eventually passed, amended to give the farmers a few extra won.
South Korea's opposition Democratic Party, whose support lies largely in the countryside, has been milking the issue for all it is worth. The impact of liberalisation would be like that of a nuclear missile, declared Lee Ki-Taek, the party's chairman, on December 7th, predicting widespread unemployment and illness caused by the chemicals in American rice.
Mr Kim has been deeply discomfited by this episode. In his television address, he apologised for having broken his campaign promise to maintain the import ban. Yet he is a secure and popular president. Japan's prime minister, Morihiro Hosokawa, by contrast, depends on a coalition. His largest partner, the Social Democratic Party, has threatened to leave if he agrees to the deal. Without it, Mr Hosokawa would not have a majority in parliament.
But public opinion is on Mr Hosokawa's side. A poll published on December 8th suggested that 64% of Japanese support their government's rumoured concession to GATT. That may be because Mr Hosokawa's performance as a reluctant importer has been so skilful. Or it may be because the vast majority of Japanese have nothing to do with farming: both as consumers and as producers they would benefit hugely from a GATT deal.
South Korea, with more farmers, has more to lose in the short term. Yet its people might consider the lessons to be drawn from their neighbours' experience. Japan's failure to open its rice market earlier has cost it dear: rice has encouraged the world to blame Japanese protectionism for the country's vast trade surplus, which has in turn encouraged foreigners to restrict the access of Japanese imports and talk up the yen. The yen's strength is squeezing Japanese exporters. Korea should count itself lucky to avoid the vice of rice.","Seoul on December 7th was a bad place to be American .

All these goodies came courtesy of the local member of parliament, Kakuei Tanaka, a former prime minister, who died late last year. So assiduous was he in bribing his constituents with unnecessary public projects that they re-elected him with a record majority even after he had been found guilty of accepting bribes.
Japan's system of multi-member constituencies is often blamed for encouraging corruption: it obliges members of the same party to stand against each other as well as the opposition. Since party colleagues cannot compete on the basis of policy differences, they vie to hand out the fattest bribes to the voters.
Morihiro Hosokawa, Japan's prime minister, has staked his career on enacting reforms intended to stop this sort of pork barrelling. He plans to scrap multi-member constituencies and to replace them with 274 single-member constituencies and 226 seats allocated by proportional representation.
His reform package got through the lower house of parliament two months ago, but is now having trouble in the upper house. On January 5th opposition parties forced the government into a concession. The ""3% requirement""--which would have kept out of parliament parties that got a smaller proportion of the vote--has been dropped. The danger is that this will create in Japan's parliament a mess much like Israel's or Italy's.
But some have a more fundamental concern about the reforms. South Korea shifted from a dual-member system to the single-member system proposed for Japan in time for the 1988 national-assembly elections. The aim was the same: to cut out corruption. The result? A failure, according to the committee of assemblymen trying to work out new ways of cleaning up Korean elections. The cost of getting elected has actually risen since the reform was pushed through. The reason, according to a ruling-party representative on the electoral-reform committee, is that too many voters like being bribed. Elections in Korea will never be clean so long as ordinary people expect cash gifts from their assemblyman every time they hold a wedding or a funeral, he says.
The South Korean president, Kim Young Sam, is planning to impose tough new electoral laws: a $60,000 limit on each candidate's campaign spending, and the ultimate deterrent for criminal candidates (or those whose staff cheat for them): the loss of their seats. The politicians who drafted these reforms are the first to admit, however, that new laws alone will not be enough to stop candidates from stuffing the ballot boxes with banknotes.

Meanwhile Japanese computer firms were quietly learning, in part from the Americans, how to make these smart machines themselves. Five years later Japanese supercomputers were on sale; ""small"" Japanese laboratories were snapping them up; and they were being hawked about in America for half the price of local ones.
Small wonder that American trade negotiators have often lost their tempers with Japan, and sought exceptional measures to gain access to its markets. They are at it again now, demanding Japan's promise to buy a specified number of cars and car parts from American firms. On February 11th, when he meets President Clinton in America, Japan's prime minister, Morihiro Hosokawa, will have to give ground on trade if he wants thins to go smoothly. Post-GATT and post-NAFTA, Mr Clinton may be tempted to look tough. Yet he would be wrong to push Japan into accepting more numerical targets. Never the best way to turn Japan into an open trader, they are more than ever in danger of becoming counter-productive.
WRONG TARGET
The case for numerical targets rests on the idea that Japan's economy is controlled to an unusual degree by government bureaucrats, who conspire with firms to keep out foreign products. In these circumstances, runs the argument, the mere absence of tariffs is not enough to make Japan a ""fair"" trader. If foreign firms are to penetrate Japan, foreign governments need the help of Japan's bureaucrats. Hence numerical targets, under which Japanese officials become responsible for making Japanese firms buy more from abroad.
This argument has been tested since 1986, when America talked Japan into promising American firms a 20% share of the Japanese market for semiconductors. In narrow terms that agreement has worked fairly well: America's share of Japan's market rose from around 9% to just over 20%. Now that it has slipped just below 20%, the Americans are waxing indignant (even though their own semiconductor industry is now booming, for reasons that appear to have little to do with the quotas America squeezed out of Japan.) The trouble is that agreements like these increase rather than diminish the power of government officials, whose excessive influence over companies was supposed to be the cause of the problem in the first place.
Enlisting the support of Japanese bureaucrats might be worthwhile if their control of the Japanese economy were eternal. But Japan's ministries have lost much of their influence over industry in the past two decades, not least (see page 65) because in many sectors, including semiconductors and aerospace, they appear to have steered companies in the wrong direction. They are now backing cautious deregulation. Some of this new thinking, such as the plan announced on January 18th to let all qualified companies, including foreign ones, compete for public-works contracts, has been brought about by American pressure. It is also true that Japan's leaders have declared for deregulation before, and then done little. This time, however, there are reasons to take them more seriously.
For decades Japan pursued export-led growth by helping producers at the expense of consumers. Regulations kept some prices high, so boosting firms' domestic profits; this provided a safe base from which to assault foreign markets. But the strategy has now hit a wall. Japan's trade surplus is too big and the yen too strong for growth to depend on ever-expanding exports. The bureaucrats know they must stimulate demand at home. Deregulation, which would cut prices and thus raise consumers' purchasing power, is the best way to do this.
A thousand vested interests still stand in the way. Japan's government is preoccupied with political reform and the need to pass a budget. Yet Mr Hosokawa seems serious about deregulation. In his six months of power, he has commissioned several deregulation studies, the most radical of which proposes scrapping 15 of Japan's 21 government departments. Last month the government sent a tough warning to obstructive bureaucrats by sacking the third most senior official in the Ministry of International Trade and Industry. It is no coincidence that the trade minister responsible for this move, Hiroshi Kumagai, is an outspoken critic of numerical targets. They intensify the old collusion between government and industry, which the minister has called ""appalling"". It is he and other liberalisers--not Japan's ailing bureaucrats--who deserve help from Mr Clinton.","In the early 1980s Japan 's government claimed that its research laboratories were too small to need American supercomputers . Meanwhile Japanese computer firms were quietly learning , in part from the Americans , how to make these smart machines themselves . Five years later Japanese supercomputers were on sale ; "" small "" Japanese laboratories were snapping them up ; and they were being hawked about in America for half the price of local ones . 
 Small wonder that American trade negotiators have often lost their tempers with Japan , and sought exceptional measures to gain access to its markets . They are at it again now , demanding Japan 's promise to buy a specified number of cars and car parts from American firms . On February 11th , when Morihito Hosokawa meets President Clinton in America , Morihito Hosokawa's , will have to give ground on trade if Morihito Hosokawa wants thins to go smoothly . Post - GATT and post - NAFTA , Mr Clinton may be tempted to look tough . Yet he would be wrong to push Japan into accepting more numerical targets . Never the best way to turn Japan into an open trader , they are more than ever in danger of becoming counter - productive . 
 WRONG TARGET 
 The case for numerical targets rests on the idea that Japan 's economy is controlled to an unusual degree by government bureaucrats , who conspire with firms to keep out foreign products . In these circumstances , runs the argument , the mere absence of tariffs is not enough to make Japan a "" fair "" trader . If foreign firms are to penetrate Japan , foreign governments need the help of Japan 's bureaucrats . Hence numerical targets , under which Japanese officials become responsible for making Japanese firms buy more from abroad . 
 This argument has been tested since 1986 , when America talked Japan into promising American firms a 20 % share of the Japanese market for semiconductors . In narrow terms that agreement has worked fairly well : America 's share of Japan 's market rose from around 9 % to just over 20 % . Now that it has slipped just below 20 % , the Americans are waxing indignant ( even though their own semiconductor industry is now booming , for reasons that appear to have little to do with the quotas America squeezed out of Japan . ) The trouble is that agreements like these increase rather than diminish the power of government officials , whose excessive influence over companies was supposed to be the cause of the problem in the first place . 
 Enlisting the support of Japanese bureaucrats might be worthwhile if their control of the Japanese economy were eternal . But Japan 's ministries have lost much of their influence over industry in the past two decades , not least ( see page 65 ) because in many sectors , including semiconductors and aerospace , they appear to have steered companies in the wrong direction . They are now backing cautious deregulation . Some of this new thinking , such as the plan announced on January 18th to let all qualified companies , including foreign ones , compete for public - works contracts , has been brought about by American pressure . It is also true that Japan 's leaders have declared for deregulation before , and then done little . This time , however , there are reasons to take them more seriously . 
 For decades Japan pursued export - led growth by helping producers at the expense of consumers . Regulations kept some prices high , so boosting firms ' domestic profits ; this provided a safe base from which to assault foreign markets . But the strategy has now hit a wall . Japan 's trade surplus is too big and the yen too strong for growth to depend on ever - expanding exports . The bureaucrats know they must stimulate demand at home .

As the government struggled to save itself and its proposed political reforms, the back-rooms filled with smoke and with politicians trying to do deals. The voters were forgotten in the furious trade of favours for support. That did not mean, however, that Japan is unchanged or unreformable.
When Morihiro Hosokawa took office last August, the voters expected change. They had, after all, just thrown out the Liberal Democrats, who had presided for 38 years over an increasingly corrupt political system. But the voters' expectations were dented on January 21st, when Social Democratic members of the upper house of parliament, supposedly coalition allies of Mr Hosokawa's, turned against him and defeated four bills destined to clean up politics. On January 27th, the LDP rejected a compromise deal to get the bills through. There will be more talking, but Mr Hosokawa may well end up as the third prime minister to fall victim to the debate on political reform.
So, after last summer's political earthquake, has Japan settled back into its old habits? Plenty of Japanese seem to think so. Yet their despair may be premature: the transition from LDP hegemony to responsive democracy was never going to be smooth. And Japan is already changing, unstoppably.
The upper house, responsible for Mr Hosokawa's troubles, is a relic of the past. Its curious collection of members, who include several (professional) comedians, was not up for re-election last year, when the voters' demand for change asserted itself. And opinion seems to be shifting further against the backward-lookers. According to an opinion poll conducted on January 23rd, support for the LDP has fallen from 36% to 23% since July and for the Social Democrats from 15% to 6%. The new, small, pro-change parties have gained ground.
Moreover, though Mr Hosokawa has so far failed to change the mechanics of Japanese politics, he has revolutionised its style. Now that no party is guaranteed power, politicians have started courting the voters. They appear on television. They answer questions from the public. They wear nice clothes. They submit themselves to indignities that western politicians have long had to put up with. The voters like it: Mr Hosokawa's popularity in December was running at 66%.
The content of Japanese politics has started to alter, too. The cleaning-out of corruption goes on. The public prosecutor's office has been hauling in politicians and businessmen suspected of complicity in the old favours-for-cash politics. The government has been starting to wrest control of Japan's economy from the bureaucrats: the ban on importing rice has been removed, and schemes to deregulate telecommunications and the building industry have been announced. Even the once-toothless Fair Trade Commission has started to bite, as the government has tried to set the domestic market free.
Since Mr Hosokawa took over, Japan's relations with its neighbours have changed, too. The prime minister's apology for Japan's behaviour in the second world war palpably reduced hostility in South Korea. Since regional security is certain to be a big issue for Japan as China grows in strength, closeness to Korea is a valuable benefit, easily won with a bit of Hosokawa-style straight talking.
IT'S BUBBLING UP FROM BELOW
Mr Hosokawa's policies are driven by the way Japan's people are changing. They are becoming more internationally minded. They are more ready to defy their employers by leaving one job for another, and to defy their parents by marrying for love, not for the matchmaker. In all sorts of ways--one of which was the display of popular anger at politicians this week--they are less willing to accept the dictates of authority.
What is more, this change of mind is irreversible. As the education system shifts from rote-learning to intellectual questioning, it will intensify. It may well be some time before Japanese politics works to the voters' satisfaction: politicians will continue to resist change, and for a while they may succeed. In the end, they will fail. Japan will reform.","It was like old times in Japan this week .

But beyond the immediate mess, there is a glint of good news.
The political crisis started on January 21st when the upper house rejected the government's proposed political reforms. By mid-week, the government was struggling to get a deal with the opposition Liberal Democratic Party. The confusion has held up government plans to pump an extra Y13 trillion ($117 billion) into the economy. The annual budget, which is normally completed in December, has not been completed either. The mess has panicked the stockmarket.
The bad news kept flowing through the week. On January 25th the government's economic forecast pronounced conditions ""sluggish"", a gloomier term than it had used last June. In 1993 department-store sales were down 6.6% on the previous year; and vehicle output dropped 10.2%, the steepest decline since 1945. In the political confusion, parliament's lower house did manage to pass one bill on January 26th. It concerned the regulation of dentistry.
Meanwhile yet another round of trade talks with America ended in stalemate. This was no coincidence, since Japan's downturn widens its trade surplus by dampening demand for imports. In America, by contrast, appetite for foreign goods is quickening along with the economy. As a result, last year's appreciation of the yen has merely dented Japan's vast trade surplus. After dipping in November, the surplus (measured in dollars) was up again in December.
No fewer than five senior members of Bill Clinton's administration have visited Tokyo this month; the latest was Lloyd Bentsen, the treasury secretary, who followed the others in attacking Japan's trade policies. The Americans want Japan's imports, which currently come to around 7% of GDP, to approach the 14.6% that is the average for OECD countries. The markets for cars, car parts, insurance, and medical and telecoms equipment are all in the firing line.
Japan's recession worsens trade tension, but the opposite is also true: it is harder these days for Japan to export its way out of trouble. In 1980, its economy shocked by high oil prices, Japan's current-account deficit was worth 1.0% of GDP, leaving room for export-led recovery. This time the surplus stands at 3.3% of GDP America demands that it should shrink to 2%, so Japan needs a domestic cure for its recession. Hence the enthusiasm for more public spending.
Unless a snap election is called, the details of the Y13 trillion stimulus will probably be announced in time for the summit between Morihiro Hosokawa, Japan's prime minister, and Bill Clinton on February 11th. It is said to involve some Y5 trillion-worth of new public works and other projects, Y1 trillion in housing loans and around Y7 trillion-worth of tax cuts.
The wait for the stimulus, coupled with the disappointments of previous ones, has bred gloom. A Tokyoite complains that ordinary Japanese have toiled to build a great country, only to see their efforts undone by worthless politicians. Yasuhiko Shibata of Yomiuri Shimbun, Japan's biggest newspaper, intones that ""Japan faces the worst crisis in its history,"" and that the country ""could face a downfall comparable to the eclipse of the ancient city of Carthage.""
Despite all this, some economists are starting to perk up. Japan's real GDP shrank by an estimated 0.1% in 1993, and seems to have fared particularly badly in the fourth quarter. Yet Jesper Koll of S.G. Warburg, an investment bank, expects the economy to grow 0.9% this year. This optimism relies mainly on consumption.
In 1986 Japan's households had debts worth 92% of their annual post-tax incomes. The American figure was similar. By the end of the decade Japan's ratio had jumped to 116%, while America's had risen only slightly. Japan's debt binge aggravated the subsequent bust: according to some estimates, the burden of repaying debt has cut consumer demand by 2% or so since 1990.
The newest numbers on household finances relate to December 1992. These show that private debt had fallen to 109% of disposable incomes--a decline far sharper than America or Britain achieved at similar points in their recessions. In 1992 Japan's housewives (husbands leave money matters to their wives) paid off a net Y1 trillion of debt, producing the first fall in the stock of household debt ever recorded.
This leads optimists to suggest that private consumption, which grew 0.8% last year, may well grow by 2% in this one. Meanwhile, government spending is starting to boost demand, as the lavish promises of the past 18 months are gradually honoured. Public-sector demand rose 10.2% year-on-year in the third quarter of 1993, despite the finance ministry's sternness.
House builders have done well from the government's anti-recession measures. About a fifth of mortgage loans come from the government's Housing Loan Corporation. which has received a total of Y5.5 trillion from previous economic stimuli. Readily available mortgages, along with lower land prices, caused real spending on houses to rise 2.3% last year, after falls in 1991 and 1992 of 8.2% and 6.7% respectively. All over Tokyo, rickety wooden houses are giving way to plastic-tiled manshons.
Easy money is also helping companies. Japan's firms are heavily indebted, so interest payments absorb around a third of the economy's operating profits. Interest rates are now at rock-bottom, lightening this burden wonderfully: according to one estimate, each percentage-point cut in interest rates boosts companies' profits by around 20%. This may avert the thing that Japan fears most--mass firings of its workers.

That was Japan in 1941, and the prime minister was Prince Fumimaro Konoe. After the recent political turmoil, something similar may happen to Prince Konoe's grandson, Morihiro Hosokawa. This cloud is hovering over Japan's generally brightening democracy.
Mr Hosokawa became prime minister in August, heading a coalition that included all Japan's parties apart from the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP), which had ruled for the previous 38 years, and the barely significant Communists. On January 29th Mr Hosokawa achieved his main aim, which was to reform the corrupt electoral and campaign-finance systems. But a strange thin had happened along the way. The Social Democratic Party (formerly the Socialist Party), the biggest member of the coalition, was worried about the losses it was likely to suffer under a new electoral system. It turned against Mr Hosokawa's reforms, and the LDP rescued him.
Formally, the Liberal Democrats remain in opposition. But, having helped to vote the reform laws through parliament, the party now expects its views to be taken as seriously as those of coalition members. On February 2nd, for example, the LDP produced a draft bill to stimulate the economy with fresh public works and tax cuts. The LDP'S leader, Yohei Kono, then demanded, and got, an audience with Mr Hosokawa.
Mr Hosokawa's colleagues, for their part, are acknowledging the virtues of cooperation with the LDP. The Social Democrats in the upper house of parliament, who nearly killed political reform, are equally hostile to a higher consumption tax. On February 3rd the party's six cabinet ministers threatened to resin because the government promised to bring in just such a tax in 1997 to make up for the loss of revenues created by an immediate Y6 trillion ($56 billion) tax cut. The government is trying to mollify the SDP, but it may take LDP support to get the stimulus bill through parliament.
Some Liberal Democrats are so keen to co-operate that they border on rebellion. Before Mr Kono agreed to back political reform, there were rumours that, if he did not, some 50 LDP members of the Diet would defy him. Toshiki Kaifu, a former prime minister who tried and failed to enact political reform, is known to sympathise with Mr Hosokawa. Mr Kono's reformism has forestalled defections from the LDP for now, but probably not for ever.
Many Liberal Democrats are worried about the next eneral election, which will probably come in a year or so, once the new constituencies required by political reform have been delineated. Joining a coalition miht help the LDP'S chances in that vote: an opinion poll taken on January 29th and 30th by Yomiuri Shimbun, Japan's biest newspaper, put the government's support at 72%, up from 66% in December.
This raises a disturbing point. The defection of a large group from the LDP suggests that a single overwhelming force will aain emerge in Japanese politics. This runs aainst the intent of Mr Hosokawa's hardwon reform, which is to boost pluralism.
The reforms will limit company donations to Y500,000 ($4,600) per politician peryear, then reduce them to nothing over a five-year period. To make up for this, Y30.9 billion of taxpayers' money is to be distributed among the parties. At the same time, Japan's system of multi-member constituencies, which is thought to encourage corruption by obliging members of the same party to compete with each other, will be replaced by 300 single-member constituencies and 11 multi-member constituencies returning 200 members of the lower house.
This is a complicated fudge, arrived at in flurried negotiations between the government and the LDP, but it does create the conditions for more policy-based politics. The question posed by the recent emeence ofa centre block is what policies, if any, parties will actually divide on. Japan's politicians have avoided policy splits for so long that they find open debate awkward. During last July's election, for example, all parties said they were for political reform though some silently opposed it. Besides, Japan prides itself on being a homogeneous place, free of racial, religious or class splits.
Yet this is only half the truth. For one thin, disparities of wealth have widened in recent years, and will widen further with the economy's shift from manufacturing to services. Besides, Japan is not without regional divides. The people of Osaka in western Japan claim a sense of humour, style of cooking and business sense that set them apart from Tokyo, and they want more local autonomy. The countryside in Japan is at odds with the towns; current efforts to deregulate the economy represent in part a victory of urban consumers over subsidised farmers.
Any of these splits could soon find sharper political expression.
Then there are national issues which, though quiet until now, could easily divide the country. One is public finance: after six years of bugdet surplus, Japan's deficit is widening fast (see page 73), and the decision to slam on the brakes could well provoke argument. In the past, too, foreign policy consisted of following America. In future Japan sees itself playing a bigger role: sending troops abroad and perhaps having a permanent seat on the United Nations Security Council.
An expanded role in the world is perhaps the likeliest cause of a split in Japan's new centrist alliance. The coalition includes Ichiro Ozawa, a loud proponent of strong policies abroad, as well as many near-pacifists. A similar division exists within the LDP. Japan's politicians are not going to divide along logical lines fast. But, gradually, they may separate and coalesce.","THE cabinet collapsed , a new one was formd -- but the same prime minister blithely carried on in office .

Toshiki Kaifu , a former prime minister who tried and failed to enact political reform , is known to sympathise with Morihito Hosokawa . Mr Kono 's reformism has forestalled defections from the LDP for now , but probably not for ever . 
 Many Liberal Democrats are worried about the next eneral election , which will probably come in a year or so , once the new constituencies required by political reform have been delineated . Joining a coalition miht help the LDP 'S chances in that vote : an opinion poll taken on January 29th and 30th by Yomiuri Shimbun , Japan 's biest newspaper , put the government 's support at 72 % , up from 66 % in December . 
 This raises a disturbing point . The defection of a large group from the LDP suggests that a single overwhelming force will aain emerge in Japanese politics . This runs aainst the intent of Morihito Hosokawa's hardwon reform , which is to boost pluralism . 
 The reforms will limit company donations to Y500,000 ( $ 4,600 ) per politician peryear , then reduce them to nothing over a five - year period . To make up for this , Y30.9 billion of taxpayers ' money is to be distributed among the parties . At the same time , Japan 's system of multi - member constituencies , which is thought to encourage corruption by obliging members of the same party to compete with each other , will be replaced by 300 single - member constituencies and 11 multi - member constituencies returning 200 members of the lower house . 
 This is a complicated fudge , arrived at in flurried negotiations between the government and the LDP , but it does create the conditions for more policy - based politics . The question posed by the recent emeence ofa centre block is what policies , if any , parties will actually divide on . Japan 's politicians have avoided policy splits for so long that they find open debate awkward . During last July 's election , for example , all parties said they were for political reform though some silently opposed it . Besides , Japan prides itself on being a homogeneous place , free of racial , religious or class splits . 
 Yet this is only half the truth . For one thin , disparities of wealth have widened in recent years , and will widen further with the economy 's shift from manufacturing to services . Besides , Japan is not without regional divides . The people of Osaka in western Japan claim a sense of humour , style of cooking and business sense that set them apart from Tokyo , and they want more local autonomy . The countryside in Japan is at odds with the towns ; current efforts to deregulate the economy represent in part a victory of urban consumers over subsidised farmers . 
 Any of these splits could soon find sharper political expression . 
 Then there are national issues which , though quiet until now , could easily divide the country . One is public finance : after six years of bugdet surplus , Japan 's deficit is widening fast ( see page 73 ) , and the decision to slam on the brakes could well provoke argument . In the past , too , foreign policy consisted of following America . In future Japan sees itself playing a bigger role : sending troops abroad and perhaps having a permanent seat on the United Nations Security Council . 
 An expanded role in the world is perhaps the likeliest cause of a split in Japan 's new centrist alliance . The coalition includes Ichiro Ozawa , a loud proponent of strong policies abroad , as well as many near - pacifists . A similar division exists within the LDP . Japan 's politicians are not going to divide along logical lines fast . But , gradually , they may separate and coalesce .",740,Japan,A29-8188,IN TERM,True,Mr Hosokawa,11,True

In the run-up to President Bill Clinton's February 11th summit with Japan's prime minister, Morihiro Hosokawa, the Americans have been using three levers to prise open Japan's supposedly closed market. The trouble is that the first seems to defy the logic of the currency markets ; it and the second ignore the state of Japan's corporate finances; and the third has run about as far as it can already.
Consider, first, America's past tactic of talking up the yen. A year ago Fred Bergsten, a Washington economist whose utterings are often taken as the unofficial view of the Clinton administration, suggested that the yen should rise by a fifth against the dollar in order to reign in Japan's trade surplus. That implied a move from Y125 to Y105 to the dollar. Perhaps because currency dealers thought his words might be backed by central-bank intervention, the yen duly started to rise, passin Y105 in August. The central bank did intervene, but to stop its rise; and the administration then seemed to renounce trying to influence the yen.
Now Mr Bergsten is at it again. On January 26th he said that a rate of Y90-100 to the dollar would be suitable (it was Y11O on that day) echoing, to Japanese ears, the attack by the Treasury secretary, Lloyd Bergtsen, on the sliding yen earlier that month. This time, however, Mr Bersten may not have the wind so strongly behind him. In the short run, admittedly, the yen could rise a bit. A frenzy of foreign buying on the Tokyo stockmarket is fuelling demand for the currency; the end of Japan's financial year on March 31st may induce some Japanese firms to sell foreign assets and repatriate the proceeds.
Beyond March, however, the market seems less likely to obey. The yen's appreciation against the dollar last year left it at least 50% higher than the level that, on most estimates, would equalise the purchasing power of the two currencies. Besides, the next move in America's interest rates is also most certain to be up, whereas Japan's will probably be down: this could spur investors to sell yen for dollars.
The wider question is what yen appreciation would achieve even if it did happen. The effectiveness of America's second method of prising open Japan's market--to demand that Japan accept numerical targets for imports in such sectors as cars and car parts--is open to similar doubts. On February 1st Mickey Kantor, America's chief trade negotiator, arrived in Tokyo to press such targets; the Japanese resisted. Even if they eventually give way, Japan's trade surplus is unlikely to budge.
A country's current-account position is identical, in its national accounts, to the gap between domestic savings and domestic investment. So a strong yen (or import targets) could reduce Japan's current-account surplus only by reducing its savings or increasing its investment. In ordinary circumstances, both might be feasible. But Andrew Smithers, a London-based economist, points out that Japan's corporate finances are far from ordinary.
Consider investment first. In the late 1980s, when the yen doubled in value against the dollar after the Plaza accord, Japan's firms did indeed boost investment in order to stay competitive: capital spending as a share of GDP leapt five percentage points in the second half of the decade. These days, however, only 65% of Japan's manufacturing capacity is being used; as a result, a strong yen is unlikely to induce firms to increase investment. On the contrary, Japan's firms are cutting costs, including capital spending: in November orders for new machinery were down by 6.9% against their value a year earlier.
If investment does not rise, a strong yen or numerical target would have to reduce savings to cut the current-account surplus. The savings rate is determined by three groups: the public sector, households and corporations (see chart on next page). Nobody expects America's levers to influence the first two; but in theory they could shift companies. Japan's big exporters lose revenues as the yen goes up, which might force them to reduce savings or increase borrowings. The catch is that corporate Japan is al'ready so indebted that fresh borrowing will be hard.
Once again, the problem arose in the late 1980s. Japan's firms took advantage of booming share prices to issue Y14.7 trillion ($102 billion) of new equity in 1986-90. At the same time, however, the lure of easy profits led managers to play the equity market as investors. Japan's firms bought, net, Y3.3 trillion-worth of shares over the period. The corporate sector, taken as a whole, thus issued a net Y11.4 trillion in equity. (True, Japanese firms also issued lots of equity-linked debt, but the collapse of the stockmarket has meant that much of this is not being convered into equity.)
Meanwhile, companies issued a hue Y359 trillion in new debt. This binge raised corporate debt, as a share of GDP, from 106% in 1986 to 13% in 1990 (and 145% in 1992), according to the OECD. The famous leveraging of America in the era of junk bonds and takeovers was mild compared with Japan's experience (although company borrowing in Britain increased faster still).
This sugests that Japan's firms are likely to respond to the strong yen not by borrowing more (which would reduce the savings rate and so the current-account surplus), but by selling equity (which would have no such effect). Conventional equity financing is hard, admittedly, because Japan's Ministry of Finance restricts new issues to prop up the volatile stockmarket. But the ministry is not blocking another form of equity financing, which is the sale by firms of shares in other companies that they amassed in the 1980s. Last year corporations sold, net, Y2.1 trillion-worth of such equities.
The Americans' third ploy is to demand that the Japanese government pump cash into the economy, so stimulating demand for imports. This is the most promising approach, since pump-priming amounts to a reduction in public-sector saving. It is also the line least resisted by the Japanese: this week Mr Hosokawa announced a planned tax cut of Y6 trillion, with further fiscal relaxation to follow.
WHEN THE PUMP RUNS DRY
Extra government spending or tax cuts should certainly dent Japan's current-account surplus. The trouble is that, when next the Americans grow angry with Japan, the pump-priming option may no longer be available. For like Japanese firms, the public sector is surprisingly heavily indebted.
Japan's finance ministry has a formidable reputation for thrift, and loudly refuses to issue bonds to plug the public-sector deficit. This is partly bluff: although it is true that ""deficit bonds"" are never issued to cover the cost of servicing the public debt, the government certainly borrows. In the year to March the ministry will probably sell around Y15 trillion in ""construction bonds"", whose infrastructure-building purpose is beside the point given that money is fungible. Having enjoyed a public-sector surplus in 1987-92, Japan had a deficit of 1% of GDP last year.
The government's forthcoming stimulus package will be partly financed with ""bride bonds"", another name chosen to soothe the finance ministry's pride. This, plus the delayed effect of Y30 trillion-worth of stimulus packages announced since August 1992, supports the OECD's belief that Japan's deficit is going up. In 1995 it is projected to hit 2.4% of GDP. Given the time lag, Japan may even have to start reigning in rather than expanding its public spending.
America's three levers-a strong yen, trade targets and fiscal stimulus--therefore all have serious weaknesses. Yet this will probably be ignored, for Mr Clinton's pressure on Japan is timed astutely. Thanks mainly to the fiscal stimuli of the past 18 months, Japan's current-account surplus is anyway declining in yen terms, and has probably peaked in dollars. Six months hence, when this trend has gathered pace, the president will no doubt claim the credit.","THEIR economy is booming , but America 's leaders are as tough as ever on depressed Japan .

America's young and inexperienced administration is trying to devise a new approach to economic relations with Japan, at a time when the future of political reform in Japan hang in the balance. So far, it has made a hash of it: regardless of any public gloss that may be put on the meeting, the underlying lack of communication between the two sides is palpable. Such mutual incomprehension is not only undesirable--for this is an alliance that America, Japan and the rest of the world cannot do without--but also quite unnecessary.
TUNNEL VISION
Lately American officials have defined their country's relationship with Japan almost exclusively in terms of the bilateral balance of trade. That was an absurdly narrow idea even when (a) America's overall trade deficit was big enough to be a genuine cause for concern and (b) Japan seemed incapable of yielding economic change without external pressure. For the moment neither of those things is true.
America's overall trade deficit is much smaller in relation to the size of the economy than it was in the mid-1980s. (It has risen recently, but this was to be expected given America's recovery and the sharp slowdown in the other big industrial countries.) Meanwhile, Japan is struggling with its best chance for years of real political change: the Liberal Democratic Party has lost its rip on power and a reform-minded prime minister is fighting to keep a fragile coalition in place. In its own interests, America should be supporting the forces of democratic change in Japan. Instead, with unforgivably bad timing, it has spent the past few weeks threatening to ""get tough"".
This policy, however, is not just badly timed. Suppose that the recent changes in Tokyo come to nothing, and that America's external deficit continues to expand until it is again a legitimate cause for concern in Washington. Suppose, in other words, that the timing looked right. How far, in such circumstances, should America risk its friendship with Japan to seek a negotiated economic remedy?
Not at all. One reason is that the most-publicised remedy--forcing Japan, on threat of retaliation, to import specified quantities of certain goods, such as car parts--will not work, even if it is agreed to and put into effect. Suppose the Japanese government made, and kept, that promise (by greatly increasing its intervention in the economy)--would that by itself narrow America's external deficit? Any first-year economics student knows that the answer is No. America's external deficit is driven by the balance between saving and investment in its domestic economy. Unless that changes, an increase in ""managed exports"" of some goods will be offset by a fall in exports of others, or by more American imports.
Some in the administration would agree, but reply that unless Japan is seen to change, support for open markets in America will fade. Getting tough is really a way to undermine America's protectionists. A noble aim--but a bad strategy. It leaves Mr Clinton's team--despite all its good economists, and its several outstanding ones--seeming to accept not only that ""voluntary"" import expansions will improve America's trade balance, but also that the Japanese economy is closed (which it isn't) and that the GATT has failed as a forum in which to seek more liberal trade (which it hasn't). Implicitly endorsing all that, the administration cannot make a convincing case for the rules-based trading system that it says it wants. And that is to waste the administration's most precious asset--Mr Clinton's ability to sell the right policy for the right reasons. When the president decided to push for NAFTA, he succeeded not by pandering to protectionists but by winning the intellectual argument.
What then is the right policy? Engage the Japanese, by all means, in friendly talks about matters of mutual economic interest. Make the case (and it is a good one) for a further easing of Japanese fiscal policy (see pae 73). Identify policies that hamper imports, such as public-procurement rules, and argue firmly for their removal (but let Japan do the same for America). Monitor bilateral trade flows, but only with a view to identifying such policies. Tell America's voters that Japan's trade is not as anomalous as Japanophobes make out, and that many of its trade ""restrictions"", such as they are, reflect private corporate behaviour that the Japanese government cannot change. Proffer no false remedies. Set no targets. Make no threats. Above all, recognise a friendship which has benefited both sides immensely--and nurture it.","Morihito Hosokawa's is a more significant event than most such summits ( see page 34 ) .

That was an absurdly narrow idea even when ( a ) America 's overall trade deficit was big enough to be a genuine cause for concern and ( b ) Japan seemed incapable of yielding economic change without external pressure . For the moment neither of those things is true . 
 America 's overall trade deficit is much smaller in relation to the size of the economy than it was in the mid-1980s . ( It has risen recently , but this was to be expected given America 's recovery and the sharp slowdown in the other big industrial countries . ) Meanwhile , Japan is struggling with its best chance for years of real political change : the Liberal Democratic Party has lost its rip on power and a reform - minded prime minister is fighting to keep a fragile coalition in place . In its own interests , America should be supporting the forces of democratic change in Japan . Instead , with unforgivably bad timing , it has spent the past few weeks threatening to "" get tough "" . 
 This policy , however , is not just badly timed . Suppose that the recent changes in Tokyo come to nothing , and that America 's external deficit continues to expand until it is again a legitimate cause for concern in Washington . Suppose , in other words , that the timing looked right . How far , in such circumstances , should America risk its friendship with Japan to seek a negotiated economic remedy ? 
 Not at all . One reason is that the most - publicised remedy -- forcing Japan , on threat of retaliation , to import specified quantities of certain goods , such as car parts -- will not work , even if it is agreed to and put into effect . Suppose the Japanese government made , and kept , that promise ( by greatly increasing its intervention in the economy)--would that by itself narrow America 's external deficit ? Any first - year economics student knows that the answer is No . America 's external deficit is driven by the balance between saving and investment in its domestic economy . Unless that changes , an increase in "" managed exports "" of some goods will be offset by a fall in exports of others , or by more American imports . 
 Some in the administration would agree , but reply that unless Japan is seen to change , support for open markets in America will fade . Getting tough is really a way to undermine America 's protectionists . A noble aim -- but a bad strategy . It leaves Mr Clinton 's team -- despite all its good economists , and its several outstanding ones -- seeming to accept not only that "" voluntary "" import expansions will improve America 's trade balance , but also that the Japanese economy is closed ( which it is n't ) and that the GATT has failed as a forum in which to seek more liberal trade ( which it has n't ) . Implicitly endorsing all that , the administration can not make a convincing case for the rules - based trading system that it says it wants . And that is to waste the administration 's most precious asset -- Mr Clinton 's ability to sell the right policy for the right reasons . When the president decided to push for NAFTA , he succeeded not by pandering to protectionists but by winning the intellectual argument . 
 What then is the right policy ? Engage the Japanese , by all means , in friendly talks about matters of mutual economic interest . Make the case ( and it is a good one ) for a further easing of Japanese fiscal policy ( see pae 73 ) . Identify policies that hamper imports , such as public - procurement rules , and argue firmly for their removal ( but let Japan do the same for America ) . Monitor bilateral trade flows , but only with a view to identifying such policies . Tell America 's voters that Japan 's trade is not as anomalous as Japanophobes make out , and that many of its trade "" restrictions "" , such as they are , reflect private corporate behaviour that the Japanese government can not change . Proffer no false remedies . Set no targets . Make no threats . Above all , recognise a friendship which has benefited both sides immensely -- and nurture it .",740,Japan,A29-8188,IN TERM,True,"BILL CLINTON 's meeting on Februaty 11th with Morihiro Hosokawa , Japan 's beleaguered prime minister ,",2,True

Last July he met a Japanese prime minister, hoping to extract promises to curb Japan's vast trade surplus. Partly because the prime minister was a lame duck, all the president got was a commitment to vague ""framework talks"" about the causes of the surplus. On Februaly 11th the president was to entertain in Washington a different Japanese prime minister to discuss the results of those talks. There are precious few results; but this prime minister, too, has suffered a domestic blow to his prestige that may render table-banging pointless.
Mr Clinton's new companion is Morihiro Hosokawa, the leader who took power in August. Until this week, Mr Hosokawa's approval rating among the Japanese had fluctuated around 70%. But the effort of preparing for the Clinton summit has caused his popularity to fall to about 50%. The motley coalition that he leads is creaking; an election is expected within a year. It is doubtful therefore whether big concessions to Mr Clinton, if made, would prove possible to implement.
Mr Hosokawa's preparations concentrated on a plan to stimulate the economy. This must be familiar to the Americans, too: it is the fourth such effort since August 1992, and each has preceded a ballyhooed meeting with America. To stave off trade sanctions, the Japanese like to show that they are doing their best to boost domestic demand, and therefore imports.
At Y15.2 trillion ($140 billion) the latest package, unveiled on February 8th, has the merit of being the biggest. Nearly 6 trillion will take the form of a tax cut; the rest consists of public works, money to prop up the land market, and subsidies to ailing banks and small business. Though the headline figure involves some double-counting of previous spending plans, most economists expect the package to boost Japan's growth rate by one or two percentage points--enough to prevent it from shrinking.
The tricky part was the tax cut. Mr Hosokawa originally proposed to balance an immediate income-tax cut with a rise in the consumption tax from 3% to 7%, starting in 1997. Japan's population is ageing even faster than that of other rich countries; this boosts welfare spending while cutting the number of income-tax payers. To escape this bind, Japan's farseeing bureaucrats want to shift to consumer taxes, which retired Japanese will help to shoulder:
Despite this good sense, Mr Hosokawa's proposal caused an uproar. Consumer taxes did not exist at all in Japan until 1989, and are still widely resented. The prime minister's coalition partners complained that they had not been consulted in advance, and that he had shown arrogant disregard for Japan's vaunted consensus.
The polls suggested that ordinary Japanese agreed. On February 8th Mr Hosokawa dropped the proposal to raise consumption tax by a set amount, and apologised for his brashness. The income-tax cut will go ahead this year; it will be extended if agreement is reached on higher indirect taxation.
The prime minister suffers other plagues. On February 10th the Bungei Shunju, a respected monthly, published a 15-page article about his fund-raising methods. This claims that the Hosokawa family received Y1 billion (to do up a house) from Kiyoshi Sagawa, a businessman who starred in one of Japan's many corruption scandals. An official in Mr Hosokawa's Japan New Party confirmed to the magazine that Mr Hosokawa did receive some cash, but not how much. On a different occasion Mr Hosokawa is said to have received a further Y100m from Mr Sagawa; the prime minister insists that this was an innocent loan, and that he repaid it.
Many prominent Japanese politicians are suspected of accepting bribes, so Mr Hosokawa may shrug off these allegations. Besides, the government's stability and success fluctuates as wildly as Japan's terrifying stockmarket. Yet this will not comfort Mr Clinton much. He faces an old Japanese problem that survives, despite the country's efforts to modernise its murky politics. Power in Japan is hard to pin down, which makes negotiation with its leaders difficult.","BILL CLINTON must be getting used to it .

Hot on the heels of Japan's (sensible) rejection of American demands for numerical targets to boost American firms' sales in Japan, the Clinton administration has threatened trade sanctions (see page 25) and baffled financial markets (see page 85). After a meeting in Washington between Bill Clinton and Japan's prime minister, Morihiro Hosokawa, had broken down rancorously, the yen spiked upwards against the dollar, and administration officials talked publicly about favouring a weaker buck. Since American interest rates recently rose, and Japanese ones are likelier to fall than rise, this is mystifying: if a weak dollar is what the White House wants, it is unclear, to say the least, how it hopes to achieve it. All this smells horribly of the summer of 1987, when a row between American officials and German ones ended in a world stockmarket crash in October. As stockmarkets again look vulnerable to a change in investors' mood, the White House's blend of trade war and policy confusion is at best reckless, at worst foolhardy.
Admittedly, its first sanctions threat was a narrow one. On February 15th America said it was drawing up trade sanctions over the next 30 days because Japan had failed to live up to an agreement to open its cellular-phones market. Yet the message is clear: unless Japan flinches first, there will be worse to come. There is talk of reviving America's 1988 ""Super 301"" trade law. This infamous crowbar for levering open foreign markets could lead to massive retaliation against ""unfairness"" in Japanese trade practices--what is ""unfair"" being defined in Washington, naturally, on the advice of American industries eager for protection. Japanese firms might be barred from government contracts. Other sanctions could be imposed in areas covered by previous deals such as semiconductors. Some congressmen have even called for import quotas on Japanese cars.
War has not yet broken out: the wheels of American trade policy grind slowly enough for compromise to be possible. But it looms perilously close. It is all a world away from Geneva just nine weeks ago, when delegates to the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) worked around the clock to conclude the Uruguay round of trade talks. Far greater national interests were then at stake than in the latest spat; and correspondingly a greater sacrifices were needed from all sides. Yet the sacrifices were made; victory was declared. What has one wrong since to a provoke talk of war, and pose such risks?
POSTCARDS FROM THE EDGE
Some comfort can be drawn from the closing days of the Uruguay round. Then too, disputes and threats were common. It was only when governments were forced to contemplate failure that compromises became possible. That could be America's plan. But it would be foolish to depend on it. A president who was anxious to avoid a worldwide trade war, and had recently proved it by striking two big free-trade deals, might think that a smaller, bilateral skirmish is worth fighting to knock sense into a recalcitrant trade partner. That is especially so when there is the extra appeal of pacifying interest groups and buying support for other plans, such as health-care reform.
Actually, the bilateral drift in American trade policy has been going on for decades. American trade advisers usually defend it as ""complementary"" to the GATT: while the world trading system sets the tone, bilateralism can bolster it. Pressure can be brought to bear on a country that is being obstructive in multilateral talks. Bilateral talks can also cover areas of trade that the GATT ignores. And it can take years to extend the GATT or tighten its rules: the Uruguay round will not come into force until July 1995, almost ten years after it began. Bilateral talks, the argument goes, produce quicker results.
These arguments were never convincing; today they are more threadbare than ever. There are no multilateral talks to ""benefit"" from American pressure on Japan. The world trading system has just been extended to cover many areas that most concern America, including procurement, agriculture and financial services. True, progress towards freer trade has not been as rapid as America would like. But their inclusion in the GATT means that they are now, for the first time, susceptible to international disciplines; America will soon be able to take complaints against Japan to the GATT (or the World Trade organization, as it is to be called).
That leaves quick results as the sole justification for bilateral dealing. But it is precisely over this that Mr. Clinton and Mr. Hosokawa have fallen out most seriously. America complains that Japan has signed bilateral deals in the past, but failed to deliver on them--the charge that has led to the telecoms sanctions. So the administration now insists that any agreement to open Japanese markets must include quantitative measures, to test whether it is being honoured. Japan has rejected the idea, rightly arguing that it would increase government involvement in the economy and lead to managed (i.e., perverted) trade.
Yet America ignores a lesson from the failure of past bilateral deals: a deal with a government is not binding on the market. America has forced the Japanese government to make promises it could not meet, in the mistaken belief that the Japanese economy is controlled from a smoke-filled room in Tokyo. Now, it is seeking to compound this error.
It is past time for America to acknowledge the real costs of its aggressive bilateralism. Its contradictions with the global trading system are not just a matter of theology--whether you ""believe"" in multilateralism or not. Far from helping the GATT, the dispute with Japan now threatens the ratification of the Uruguay round, which will begin after the treaty has been formally signed in Morocco in April. Until now, American congressmen have tried to keep ratification of the GATT deal separate from other issues in trade policy. But the distinction will be hard to keep once Japan is a target for broad sanctions.
Congressional pressure poses another threat. If America pursues Japan, it will being to undermine the new WTO even before it has been born. That would not only encourage others to flout the system's rules; it would also squander the effort that Mr. Clinton put into saving the Uruguay round. Once again, the stakes are high: the world trading system, a stockmarket crash, the jobs and livelihoods of millions of ordinary people.

The president started the ""framework"" talks between America and Japan seven months ago, when Kiichi Miyazawa, an old-guard Liberal Democrat, led Japan. A deadline of February 11th had been set for agreement on ways to open up Japanese markets. The odds for success ought to have been raised when the coalition led by Morihiro Hosokawa, Japan's reformist prime minister, came to power. Since Mr. Clinton and Mr. Hosokawa were obliged to admit, on February 12th, that their talks had come to naught, the future of the two countries' trade relations has been thrown perilously open.
Plenty of blame is being bandied about. The Americans accuse Japanese negotiators of over-literalness during the discussions: ""slippery"" is the word some are using. This attitude, say the Americans, ruled out serious discussion of a more general commitment to open markets in Japan. It led the Americans to insist on those infamous ""targets"" for a larger market share in various Japanese sectors, such as cars, car parts, public procurement and medical equipment. For their part, the Japanese-crying ""managed trade""--say they had no choice but to dig in their heels over targets that bureaucrats and politicians were either unable or unwilling to deliver.
American negotiators also complain that, until the final days of the talks, the political commitment in Japan to an agreement was simply not there. On the American side, the framework talks had been coordinated with smooth unanimity from within the White House, through the new National Economic Council (NEC). In Japan, it was the foreign ministry that took the lead. For most of the time, bureaucrats were in charge; ministers, according to one American negotiator, seemed to be reading from briefing notes.
Late in the night of February 10th, progress briefly seemed possible. After dining with Mr. Hosokawa at Blair House, Japan's foreign minister, Tsutomu Hata, called for a meeting between himself, America's trade representative, Mickey Kantor, Bowman Cutter from the NEC and Japan's chief trade negotiator. The prepared texts were put away. The Americans said they were ready to put in writing that various ""indicators"" of market share would not later be used as ""targets"". They admitted to certain a ""awkwardnesses"" in the American stand: that, for instance, it was hard to insist on a hefty market share for American cars since Detroit barely produced any right-hand-drive models. Had such awkwardnesses been brought out earlier, the talks might have been saved. As it was, the Americans had boxed both sides into a corner, and time had run out.
A majority of the administration's trade people privately feel some sympathy with the Japanese, and admit that the attempts negotiate market-share targets with Japan have run their course. The Japanese do not easily forget the 1986 semiconductor accord, when they agreed that the Americans should aim for a greater share of Japan's semiconductor market. The desired share, 20%, was quickly interpreted by the Americans as being a firm commitment. Now the Japanese are being attacked because that share has diminished. Yet the market is growing rapidly, benefiting American and Japanese chipmakers alike.
Yet if market-share targets are to be abandoned, the administration is not at all clear what should take their place. In the meantime, the pressure for face-saving retaliation against Japan is growing. On February 15th Mr. Kantor announced that America was drawing up a list of sanctions against Japanese products, worth several hundred million dollars, because Japan had reneged on agreements to grant Motorola, an American company, greater access to Japan's cellular-phone market.
This is a long-simmering dispute, and one unconnected with the framework talks. Mr. Kantor said it had nothing to do with targets or market share. But the administration's response has been hurried forward, and the issue is bound to be thrown into the argument.
So, too, is the desire by both Congress and the administration to reinstate the ""Super 301"" provision of America's trade laws. This grants America broad unilateral powers to find, and retaliate against, allegedly discriminatory trade practices by other countries. It is an unwelcome time for Super 301 to be revived. As it is, according to some estimates, America's anti-dumping actions, countervailing duties and the like disrupt as much international trade as Japan's anti-competitive practices. A vigorous use of Super 301 would not only do more to disrupt trade; it would also undermine the multilateral efforts to improve dispute-settlement procedures that have just been agreed under the Uruguay round of trade talks.
It is not yet certain that Mr. Clinton, who seems determined now to take personal charge of America's economic relations with Japan, will head down the jinoistic path. He may prefer to wait for Mr. Hosokawa to deliver on the promises he has made to the Japanese to free the economy of regulations that keep prices iniquitously high. America, certainly, has a legitimate interest in such issues. But instead of gauging its interest in terms of market share, argues Gary Saxonhouse of the University of Michigan, it should look instead at price structures in various Japanese sectors. Where in Japan are prices out of line with other countries, after taking distribution and transport costs into account? The administration has done woefully little work on the matter.
In the absence of any new trade policy towards Japan, America has turned back to an old and rather clumsy lever, the exchange rate. Since the collapse of the trade talks, the yen has soared, threatening to break through Y100 to the dollar (see page 85). The administration professes to remain aloof from these market exertions. It is, of course, delighted that a strong yen could squeeze Japanese exporters so hard that they will beg their bureaucrats to cede to American trade demands.
The administration also hopes that a strong yen will help to cut Japan's $60-billion trade surplus with America, particularly if Japan, despite its promises, fails to ease its fiscal constraint. A strong yen might well help to cut the surplus (though the surplus is neither bad in itself nor a measure of Japan's trade barriers), but that is not the point. What matters is whether the yen is near its ""equilibrium"" level vis-a-vis the dollar. If that equilibrium is nearer Y110-115--and economists at the Treasury Department were prepared to admit as much only a few months ago--then the yen has overshot. The administration's goading of the exchange rate will therefore have produced more long-term economic distortions than short-term political gains.","It was an outcome that Bill Clinton 's administration could see coming from a long way off , but did little to prevent . The president started the "" framework "" talks between Morihito Hosokawa seven months ago , when Kiichi Miyazawa , an old - guard Liberal Democrat , led Japan . A deadline of February 11th had been set for agreement on ways to open up Japanese markets . The odds for success ought to have been raised when the coalition led by Morihiro Hosokawa , Japan 's reformist prime minister , came to power . Since Morihito Hosokawa were obliged to admit , on February 12th , that Morihito Hosokawa's talks had come to naught , the future of Morihito Hosokawa's trade relations has been thrown perilously open . 
 Plenty of blame is being bandied about . The Americans accuse Japanese negotiators of over - literalness during the discussions : "" slippery "" is the word some are using . This attitude , say the Americans , ruled out serious discussion of a more general commitment to open markets in Japan . It led the Americans to insist on those infamous "" targets "" for a larger market share in various Japanese sectors , such as cars , car parts , public procurement and medical equipment . For their part , the Japanese - crying "" managed trade""--say they had no choice but to dig in their heels over targets that bureaucrats and politicians were either unable or unwilling to deliver . 
 American negotiators also complain that , until the final days of the talks , the political commitment in Japan to an agreement was simply not there . On the American side , the framework talks had been coordinated with smooth unanimity from within the White House , through the new National Economic Council ( NEC ) . In Japan , it was the foreign ministry that took the lead . For most of the time , bureaucrats were in charge ; ministers , according to one American negotiator , seemed to be reading from briefing notes . 
 Late in the night of February 10th , progress briefly seemed possible . After dining with Mr. Hosokawa at Blair House , Japan 's foreign minister , Tsutomu Hata , called for a meeting between himself , America 's trade representative , Mickey Kantor , Bowman Cutter from the NEC and Japan 's chief trade negotiator .

Japan's present leader, Morihiro Hosokawa, has gone one better. Having used last year's summit in Seattle to look chummy and relaxed in Bill Clinton's company, he chose on February 12th to act tough with the president. In the 1980s, the idea that Japan might say No to America inspired a provocative book title. Now it has actually happened.
The two leaders met in Washington to discuss Japan's vast trade surplus. Although this seemed to have peaked in November, figures released on February 16th suggested otherwise: in January alone, the surplus came to $6.1 billion, up 17% on a year ago. The Japanese agree they must do something about this, but dislike the American plan to measure market-opening efforts numerically. By rejecting numerical targets, Mr. Hosokawa broke a Japanese tradition of caving in to America at the last moment.
Toughness has a price. The yen leapt from Y108 to Y102 against the dollar, dealing a blow to Japan's export-led economy. Then, on February 15th, the Americans pronounced Japan's cellular-telephone market to be rigged, and said they were preparing trade sanctions (see page 85). Yet Mr. Hosokawa remained uncowed. On February 16th he declared that, if sanctions were imposed, Japan would file a complaint under the GATT rules on world trade. With impudent cool, he added that he and Mr. Clinton had held interesting talks about AIDS and the environment.
Just as remarkably, nearly all Japanese support this defiance. Immediately after the summit, businessmen, bureaucrats and even opposition politicians reckoned the prime minister had done the right thing. The confidence wavered as the yen shot up, and there were calls for the government to placate America by taking unilateral steps to open its market to imports. Yet nobody suggested that Mr. Hosokawa should have accepted numerical targets.
Why has Japan stiffened towards America so much? In part because it can afford to. The end of the cold war has reduced Japan's reliance on America's defence shield, although a possibly nuclear threat still lurks in communist North Korea. Japan is less economically reliant on America too, because its investment and trade are flowing increasingly to Asia.
Besides, Japan's firms have set up so many factories abroad that the Americans may have difficulty hurting them with sanctions. An American ban on Japanese exports of cellular telephones, for example, would have little effect, because Japanese manufacturers of these gadgets all have factories overseas. All but one could make the telephones in America.
Yet this is not the only reason for Japan's defiance: after all, friction with America still hurts, albeit less than it used to. The truth is that Mr. Hosokawa hates the boost that numerical targets give to the role of the bureaucracy; he was elected partly on a promise to stem bureaucratic influence. And, since ad ministering the targets is a thankless task the mandarins themselves resent them.
For two decades, and with increasing frequency, Japan has agreed to ""voluntary"" restraints on its trade. These involved bureaucrats telling businessmen to pass up market opportunities, always on the argument that this would placate the foreigners on whose markets Japan depended. But the foreigners were not placated.

At the end of last month a compromise on political reform saved the country's government from collapsing, opening the way to a fiscal package to stimulate the economy. The Nikkei 300 share-price index, which had plunged 4.8% on news that political reform had been defeated (in the event, temporarily), started heading up again. Now a different political upset has spoilt things.
On February 12th America's president, Bill Clinton and Japan's prime minister, Morihiro Hosokawa, met to discuss ways to reduce Japan's trade surplus--and failed to agree on anything. This rattled investors, mainly because of the effect on the yen. The Nikkei 300 fell by 3.1% on February 14th and 15th before levelling off on February 16th and falling again the next day.
In the past, the Americans have used the dollar-yen exchange rate to put pressure on Japan: each Y10 rise in the yen's value against the dollar is reckoned to knock around 5-10% off Japan's corporate profits. The mere fear that the Americans would again talk up the yen panicked the markets.
On February 15th the currency was trading at Y102 to the dollar, up from Y108 the day before the summit. This clobbered the shares of Japan's big exporting firms.
The second scary result of the trade row is the threat of American sanctions. On February 15th the Americans declared that, since Japan had failed to deliver on an agreement to open its cellular-phone market to foreign firms, they would draw up a list of possible reprisals. Other industries, notably cars, may soon attract American wrath. Like the strong yen, trade sanctions would hurt Japan's corporate profits.
Both worries may yet fade. At midweek some fund managers were predicting that the yen might go through T100 to the dollar; but the present yen rise, unlike last year's even sharper jump, cannot count on the support of central bankers. America's Federal Reserve has started to raise short-term interest rates, and the Bank of Japan's next move is likely to be downwards: this argues for a stronger dollar, not a stronger yen.
Trade sanctions, too, may sound worse than they are. Japanese exporters have set up so many factories abroad that they can sidestep sanctions aimed at their domestic operations. Besides, Japan's government will do its best to head sanctions off. It will appeal to the GATT rules on world trade, which lay down strict conditions before punitive action can be taken. And it will try to announce new measures to deregulate its markets, so soothing the Americans.
A respite could trigger a new rush of foreign money into Japanese shares, motivated less by optimism about the Tokyo stock market than by queasiness over most of the world's other markets. But foreign buying of Japanese equities, which came to a net Y1 trillion ($9 billion) last month, is likely to be met with selling by domestic investors.
The chief sellers are industrial companies, which accumulated shares in each other in the flush 1980s. These days Japan's corporate sector has a deficit running at about 5% of GDP. Since firms are already loaded with debt and the finance ministry discourages new share issues, many are trying to plug the gap through sales of assets, including cross-shareholdings.
The foreign bulls are betting that such corporate selling will be swamped by other domestic investors' buying. They have their eyes on two groups: life insurers (which hold some Y160 trillion of funds), and individuals (who are sitting on Y1,000 trillion). Unlike companies, which are leaking cash, both of these groups are accumulating it. Life insurers' assets are growing by some Y1 trillion a month; households are saving around 15% of their incomes. Rock-bottom interest rates have made bank deposits and bonds unattractive. It seems a sure thing that insurers and individuals, between them, will save Tokyo's market.
Yes, but when? Optimists spy signs that the day may be approaching. Life insurers have recovered from their extreme pessimism of early last year, when they were putting almost none of their new money into the stock market. Individuals remain net sellers of Japanese stocks, but have tired of low returns on other assets: in November miserable yields turned them into net sellers of bonds for the first time since January 1990. Private money has been piling into equity mutual funds invested in Foreign markets: Nomura Securities raised Y245 billion in the fourth quarter of 1993 for foreign equity mutual funds, nearly four times as much as it took in for domestic equity investment. This suggests that Japanese punters will not hesitate to buy shares at home when they deem them promising; indeed, Nomura says its Japanese funds are selling as well as foreign ones this month.
Before they take the plunge, however, Japanese investors want evidence that corporate profits will pick up this year, which many foreigners expect. Jason James, an equity strategist at James Capel, reckons that despite the strong yen (which may, after all, prove a fleeting phenomenon) corporate profits will reverse four years of decline in the year starting in April, growing by a fifth. Firms' financial costs are coming down as lower interest rates make themselves felt. Staff costs will start to fall as overtime is further reduced, bonuses are cut, and staff numbers squeezed through hiring freezes and early retirement. This should more than make up, thinks Mr James, for the lower revenues inflicted by deflation.
For the moment, life insurers do not believe this. Glum economic statistics sustain their doubts; in January the number of bankruptcies jumped nearly 18% over the previous month. Yet not all the news is bad.
In December private-sector machinery orders were 5.3% higher than in November, suggesting that the long decline in corporate investment may at last be over.
While the economic figures stay mixed, Tokyo's investors will be kept busy by politics. The immediate worry is that more domestic political shocks may follow the spat with the Americans. Recent optimism, over both the stockmarket and the economy, was based on the vast government pump-priming expected throughout last month and announced on February 8th. Yet the Diet (parliament) has so far passed neither this special Y15.2-trillion stimulus package nor the regular budget for the year starting in April. Rumours abound of fresh splits within Mr Hosokawa's coalition. A delay in passing his spending and tax-cutting bills could send the market tumbling.","Just when they thought the road ahead was clear , investors in Japan have banged their shins against a new obstacle .

In the summer of 1992 candidate Bill Clinton met famously with a gang of academic economists, from whom he later drew his chief economic adviser, Laura Tyson, and Larry Summers, the Treasury Department's top person on international affairs. He later called these two, plus a good scattering of Nobelists and other worthies, to his ""economic summit"" in Little Rock, where the president-elect bit his lip over the velocity of M2.
The administration craves approval from outside economists. And from the Treasury-bond market. All last year the White House crowed about how yields were falling thanks to the deficit-cutting measures that Mr Clinton sought in the budget. It is now disturbed that yields in the past few weeks have leapt back up (see page 73). It seems an unconnected event, but the administration was also appalled late last year when a crowd of America's top economists signed an open letter, organised by Jagdish Bhagwati of Columbia University, to Mr Clinton and to the Japanese prime minister, Morihiro Hosokawa, criticising the administration's trade policy.
These two issues--the bond yield and policy towards Japan--are in fact connected, and their link is the dollar. It was in Washington on February 12th that Mr Clinton and Mr Hosokawa declared that the ""framework"" talks, meant (at least in the Americans' opinion) to prise open closed markets in Japan, had come to naught. The threat of trade tensions sent the dollar slumping against the yen, even though the Federal Reserve had recently raised interest rates. The dollar's fall therefore tempted holders of dollar-denominated bonds to sell more of them, raising the bonds' yields.
The notion that Japan must be ""villainised"" and beat about the head, by means of a weak dollar or otherwise, has many advocates within the administration. Most outside economists of repute disagree with, or even deplore, this approach. Privately, neither Ms Tyson nor Mr Summers has time for the cruder rhetoric of the administration's Japan-bashers--but there is little they can do about it. Both played a crucial early part in shaping the policy that has now emerged.
Ms Tyson has long advocated a tough, tit-for-tat stance towards those economies, notably Japan, that held out against American exports. Mr Summers helped provide the administration with an intellectual compass for looking at what he called, in a private letter, Japan's ""aberrant trade structure"". He still defends America's insistence on market-share targets--arguing that they are really mere ""indicators"" of progress. He objects strongly to the idea that the administration is striving for managed trade--but managed trade is precisely what those who applaud the administration's hard line really want.
Both Ms Tyson and Mr Summers know full well that Japan's structural barriers (such as they are) have little bearing on its current-account surplus with America and the rest of the world. Again, it is a point often lost upon some of Mr Clinton's political handlers. Last summer Ms Tyson argued, though not forcefully, for leaving fiscal matters--the only area in which the Japanese government can have much effect on the trade imbalance--out of the framework talks. Her fear was that the issue of the surplus might become bound up emotionally with market-opening discussions. That is exactly what has happened.
Mr Summers's Treasury has been the department most concerned about promoting a strong yen and weak dollar. The fear last autumn was that Mr Hosokawa's reformist government could be undermined by a strong yen, which would therefore harm America's interests too. Back then, Mr Summers acquiesced in the market's desire to push the yen down against the dollar. He was then the point man thinking about the exchange rate. But now almost everyone in the administration, including Mr Clinton's closest and most hard-line courtiers--such as Robert Rubin at the National Economic Council and Roger Altman, the deputy secretary at Treasury--seems to have an idea about it, and that is to push the yen upwards. Mr Summers has little choice but to go along. Some friends of Mr Summers and Ms Tyson worry that to both have been co-opted too much into the political process, at the expense of economic reason. Politics was ever thus.
The ability of the administration's bright economists to be a source of good policy, as opposed to clever justifications of bad policy, will next be tested in the great fight for health-care reform. It is here that the Council of Economic Advisers, which Ms Tyson chairs, will be tested for its impartiality. The council has no line responsibilities within the administration, and so in theory can be as critical of administration policy as it likes. (Martin Feldstein and William Niskanen, CEA chairmen during the 1980s, showed how.) By the same measure, however, this can deprive the chairman of influence over policy.
Already Ms Tyson has come under fire for exaggerating claims that spending cuts proposed last autumn by Tim Penny in Congress, but opposed by the administration, could harm the economy. The chapter on health care in her Economic Report to the President, just published, is bland on the economically dangerous issues of premium caps, employer mandates and other interventions. These are legitimate matters for the CEA, but the chapter bears all the hallmarks of White House vetting. In the end, the council's independence may be sacrificed to the collegiality of the Clinton team--and the administration's star economists will be harnessed, once again, to the cause of tactical politics.","No administration has sought as diligently as this one the seal of approval from the Enlightened Order of Economists . In the summer of 1992 candidate Bill Clinton met famously with a gang of academic economists , from whom he later drew his chief economic adviser , Laura Tyson , and Larry Summers , the Treasury Department 's top person on international affairs . He later called these two , plus a good scattering of Nobelists and other worthies , to his "" economic summit "" in Little Rock , where the president - elect bit his lip over the velocity of M2 . 
 The administration craves approval from outside economists . And from the Treasury - bond market . All last year the White House crowed about how yields were falling thanks to the deficit - cutting measures that Mr Clinton sought in the budget . It is now disturbed that yields in the past few weeks have leapt back up ( see page 73 ) . It seems an unconnected event , but the administration was also appalled late last year when a crowd of America 's top economists signed an open letter , organised by Jagdish Bhagwati of Columbia University , to Mr Clinton and to Morihito Hosokawa , criticising the administration 's trade policy . 
 These two issues -- the bond yield and policy towards Japan -- are in fact connected , and their link is the dollar . It was in Washington on February 12th that Mr Clinton and Morihito Hosokawa declared that the "" framework "" talks , meant ( at least in the Americans ' opinion ) to prise open closed markets in Japan , had come to naught . The threat of trade tensions sent the dollar slumping against the yen , even though the Federal Reserve had recently raised interest rates . The dollar 's fall therefore tempted holders of dollar - denominated bonds to sell more of them , raising the bonds ' yields . 
 The notion that Japan must be "" villainised "" and beat about the head , by means of a weak dollar or otherwise , has many advocates within the administration . Most outside economists of repute disagree with , or even deplore , this approach . Privately , neither Ms Tyson nor Mr Summers has time for the cruder rhetoric of the administration 's Japan - bashers -- but there is little they can do about it . Both played a crucial early part in shaping the policy that has now emerged . 
 Ms Tyson has long advocated a tough , tit - for - tat stance towards those economies , notably Japan , that held out against American exports . Mr Summers helped provide the administration with an intellectual compass for looking at what he called , in a private letter , Japan 's "" aberrant trade structure "" . He still defends America 's insistence on market - share targets -- arguing that they are really mere "" indicators "" of progress . He objects strongly to the idea that the administration is striving for managed trade -- but managed trade is precisely what those who applaud the administration 's hard line really want .

After the second world war, Britain adjusted to its diminished power by becoming the Americans' soundest friend in Europe. France had Gaullist anti-Americanism, Germany a greenish, left-wing sort, and Russia was plain hostile. America needed a dependable ally in the world's second richest continent.
Now Asia is where money gets made, and Japan could render itself similarly useful. Plain hostility is awake in North Korea, and sleeps fitfully in China. Tetchy allies abound. South Korea, though protected from the North by American troops, periodically succumbs to anti-American riots. Indonesia and Malaysia are both charmed by the anti-American ideas of the non-aligned movement.
Japan has motive enough to help America. Diplomatic help might soothe American fury at Japan's vast trade surplus, which has recently erupted into threats of sanctions. This bust-up has driven up the yen, hurting Japan's exporters and dimming hopes of shaking off recession. Having stoutly rejected America's demands for ""numerical targets"" to measure progress in opening their market to foreign goods, some Japanese now seem to be wavering. A senior politician has suggested ""effort goals"", which might include some numbers.
Helpful, British-style diplomacy might also sustain America's appetite for guaranteeing Japanese security. The end of the cold war has encouraged some Japanese to feel that they can act independently of America, and the Americans are even more tempted to play down the alliance. The post-cold-war threats, notably from North Korea, are more local than was Russian communism. Japan therefore needs American protection more than America needs a vast military base on the northern rim of Asia.
At first sight Japan seems bad at using Asian ties to cement its alliance with America; indeed it seems limp in all multilateral diplomacy. On February 21st Jeffrey Garten, a senior American trade official, began a two-week trip to Asia by asking his hosts to back America in its trade row with Japan. Meanwhile, the Americans also solicited support from Sir Leon Brittan, the European Union's top trade man. Japan, for its part, has merely threatened to refer American trade sanctions to the GATT. That is more than it has ventured during past trade rows, but still mild compared to American swashbuckling.
And yet Japan's diplomats have not been idle. They have succeeded, since the start of this year, in greatly strengthening ties with China. On February 23rd Zhu Rongji, China's vice premier and top economics man, arrived in Japan for a nine-day visit, praising the two countries' booming trade and declaring his interest in Japan's economic model. This comes on top of a visit by Japan's foreign minister, Tsutomu Hata, to China in January; in March Morihiro Hosokawa, the prime minister, is due to follow.
This chumminess is being used to help America. Mr Hata asked his Chinese hosts why their military budget had grown 15% in the 1993 fiscal year, and urged them not to transfer missile technology to the world's undesirables. He also asked for Chinese help in getting North Korea to open its doors to international nuclear inspectors. This straight talk reinforced American demands on the Chinese. It also represented a change: Japan has until recently been shy of criticising its vast neighbour.
This formula--make friends, then use the friendship to help America--may be repeated elsewhere. Japan's vast aid budget is spent mostly in Asia, which is also attracting a growing share of private Japanese investment. These money flows were sweetened last year, when Mr Hosokawa eased Asian memories of the second world war by apologising for Japan's excesses. This has improved relations most notably with South Korea. In March its president, Kim Young Sam, will visit Tokyo.
Japan has already used its clout to squash a Malaysian idea for something called an East Asian Economic Caucus, which would exclude America; instead, Japan backed the Asia-Pacific Economic Forum, which includes it. Japan also helps to maintain Asia's consensus in favour of keeping American troops in the region. It maintains links with the unpleasant government in Myanmar (Burma), whereas the Americans shun it. But even here, the Japanese use their contacts with Myanmar's officials to deliver America's pro-democracy message.
Japan may one day prove most helpful in a way that seems Far-fetched today--namely, on trade. As Japan opens its markets to foreign goods, Asia's dynamic exporters are the obvious next target for America's irritation with its own current-account deficit. How convenient for America if the Japanese, having experienced the full force of America's battering ram, advised other Asian countries that there is little point in resisting it.","What , mused a Japanese diplomat this month , could his country learn from Britain 's relationship with America ?

Situation excellent. I shall attack."" With these old words, Field-Marshal Foch helped turn the battle of the Marne and save Paris from foreign occupation. How Japan's prime minister, Morihiro Hosokawa, must hope they apply to him too.
Mr Hosokawa's cabinet is split. It always was, of course, because from the beginning it was an alliance of the ""outs"" against the ""ins"", with the ""outs"" having little in common except non-membership of the ruling Liberal Democratic Party(Lop). But now the split is very public, and the government's ability to do anything about reform in general, and the trade grow with America in particular, is in doubt.
Although, as prime minister, Mr Hosokawa is theoretically in charge, Japan's leadership looks more like a triumvirate. The other two members are Masayoshi Takemura, the cabinet secretary and head of the New Party Harbinger, and Ichiro Ozawa, co-leader of the Japan Renewal Party. Technically, Mr Ozawa is not even part of the government, but his influence, and his reputation as a fixer, are nevertheless considerable.
Until recently, relations between the three men were reasonably cordial. Mr Hosokawa and Mr Takemura were actually old friends. They fell out mainly over tax reform. Mr Hosokawa wanted to reduce income tax as part of a plan to stimulate the economy. To balance this loss of revenue, he proposed an increase in Japan's 3% sales tax, deferred until 1997.
With the support of Mr Takemura, the relatively left-win Social Democratic Party (also part of the coalition) managed to stymie this. To his fury, Mr Hosokawa then had to change his income-tax proposal in order to square the books at the finance ministry. The tax cut is now guaranteed for only a year; its continuation beyond that depends on the sales-tax increase going through in the future.
By the middle of February, Mr Hosokawa was trying to decide if he could afford to throw Mr Takemura out of the cabinet. After dithering for a fortnight, he botched it.
The reshuffle was expected by March 4th. It did not happen.
Having failed to get rid of Mr Takemura, Mr Hosokawa looks weak. His relations with Mr Ozawa are deteriorating too. If anything, Mr Ozawa is more eager to see economic reform than is Mr Hosokawa, but is frustrated that it is not happening--at least, not fast enough (see page 71). A coherent response to the slow fuse of Super-301 trade sanctions just lit by America's president, Bill Clinton, therefore seems unlikely.
At the moment the government is affecting an air of unconcern. Soon after the non-announcement of the reshuffle, Mr Hosokawa made a waffly speech to the Diet (parliament) about the need for economic and administrative reform-promising, among other things, to ""structure society for boundless creative individuality"". The trade issue was hardly touched on. True, sanctions under Super 301 will not come into effect until September; and even then, any American action would be heavily restrained by the rules of the GATT. But the Americans are likely to want negotiations with, and decisions from, the Japanese on a whole range of issues before then.
The main force holding the seven-party government together seems to be a consensus that it is not, at present, in any of the partners' interest to have an election. The government's opinion-poll ratings are slipping, and Mr Hosokawa's one successful reform, that of the electoral system, will not be in place for at least a year. Any election fought before then would be under the old rules: multi-member constituencies with the countryside over-represented. The LDP might win easily.
Still, with an eye to the future, politicians are already making their dispositions behind the scenes. Several of the partners in the coalition appear to be stitching up electoral pacts to stand down in favour of one another (but not in the interests of the coalition as a whole) in particular constituencies.

Warren Christopher, America's secretary of state, greeted Japanese leaders in Tokyo on March 10th with all the diplomatic poise of his 19th-century predecessors. Like them, his mission was to persuade Japan to open its markets. But Mr Christopher also brought a threat. Less than a week before his arrival, Bill Clinton revived a trade law known as ""Super 301"" that had lapsed in 1990.
The response to Mr Clinton's re-armament was, predictably, mixed. While Congress cheered, Sir Leon Brittan, the trade boss for the European Union, described it as ""disappointing"". Peter Sutherland, head of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, called America's denomination of Japan ""misguided and dangerous"". The Japanese edged quietly towards settling disputes over mobile telecommunications and increased imports of American Jeeps.
Does Super 301 therefore work? Despite its prefix, it is technically little different from ""normal"" section 301, an old provision of American trade law that allows individuals or the government to retaliate against ""unjustifiable, unreasonable or discriminatory"" traders abroad. Super 301, which was invented in 1988, adds to this a rigid timetable, which is meant to prevent the president from being soft on foreigners by quietly dropping suits.
Mr Clinton still has as much as two years to decide how tough to be. At the end of March, America will publish a list of ""unfair"" trading practices. Six months later it will begin to investigate a few of the most serious cases. And three weeks after that, the 301 complaints can become formal. The aim is to negotiate better deals long before retaliatory sanctions are actually imposed.
The chart below, from an analysis of American trade policy in 1975-90 by Patrick Low, an economist now working at the World Bank, shows the outcome of all section 301 investigations (including ""Special 301"", a third category aimed at protecting American intellectual property).(chart omitted) Overall the record is poor: liberalisation occurred in only a third of cases and retaliation in a tenth. Section 301 has been most successful against Japan and South Korea, achieving its aim 68% of the time. However, the record of Super 301, which has been used against only India, Brazil and Japan, is much worse. It has achieved minimal liberalisation for maximum trade friction. Super 301's overtly political rhetoric, which America regards as a strength, is seen abroad as a liability (nobody likes being seen to be kicked about).
Mr Low's analysis comes with a sting in the tail. Even in the cases where 301 worked, the victory was often Pyrrhic. For a start, an adhesive trade policy undermines existing American trade. And the ""liberalisation"" that does occur has sometimes taken the form of market-sharing arrangements, such as the semi-conductor trade agreement, that hurt American consumers more than they benefit American producers.
Super 301 was conceived at a time when America had lost patience with the GATT's barely functioning dispute-settlement system. Although it explicitly says that America must use the GATT wherever possible, the provision still has a unilateral bent. The Uruguay round, which was concluded in December, has now changed the environment by bringing new areas of trade under the jurisdiction of a new World Trade Organisation (WTO). It also overhauled dispute settlement.
There are still potential offenders, such as China, which is not yet a GATT member, that Super 301 could be fired at; there are also areas, such as parts of government procurement, that the Uruguay round does not cover. But to the usual targets, including Japan and the European Union, Super 301 looks, at best, like an elaborate way to channel disputes into the WTO.
That would sit uncomfortably beside the aggressive rhetoric that Mr Clinton's trade policy encourages--especially if America feels that the WTO's disciplines cannot touch Japan's ""structural"" trade barriers. At worst, therefore, Super 301 could become a perverse pursuit of unilateralism, breaching the promises to be initialled at the formal signing of the Uruguay round in Morocco next month. That would blast apart the WTO before it has even begun.
Beyond all these worries is the potential effect of Mr Clinton's unboat diplomacy on Japanese deregulation. Deregulation is picking apart structural barriers to foreign trade and investment in Japan far faster than any trade negotiators. True, further deregulation might not affect the size of Japan's massive trade surplus with the rest of the world (which depends upon the country's savings and investment, not on trade barriers). But it would cure many of America's biggest individual gripes. Opening the car market, for instance, might go a long way towards placating the administration, since this sector accounts for two-thirds of America's bilateral deficit.
PAPER TIGER
Since Morihiro Hosokawa became Japan's prime minister last August, officialdom has been goaded into action. The Ministry of Transport, for example, often regarded as a a fierce over-regulator, is about to open an office in Detroit so that cars can be inspected as they leave the factory, rather than when a they land at Yokohama. But in most areas, real loosening has yet to begin. The Ministry of Finance has reformed the insurance market, but only in minor ways. The juiciest bits of the business--life, car, fire and commercial insurance--remain closed to foreign competition.
This patchy record reflects conflicts in side Japan's political establishment. Many younger bureaucrats genuinely favour deregulation. Older ones are more conservative. If it is given free rein, self-interest should build up momentum behind reform. Moran Stanley, an American investment bank, estimates that the effects of regulation on trade cost Japan almost Y11 trillion ($105 billion) a year.
The revival of Super 301 threatens to block further deregulation. If Japan politely refuses to make further concessions to of America, tensions between the two countries could worsen, weakening Mr Hosokawa's government (which is already badly split-see page 38) and thus slowing reform. If instead Japan agrees to America's demands and introduces import targets, the of outcome would doubtless be hailed as a victory for Super 301. Yet it would still frustrate America's underlying aims, because managed targets mean stronger bureaucrats, which implies less deregulation.
Naturally, deregulation will not guarantee higher American exports. One reason why Detroit's car makers sold only 20,000 cars in Japan last year was that, unlike Germany's Mercedes-Benz and BMW, they have not set up dealer networks; Ford is sidestepping this by extending its arrangement's to deal through the Toyota and Nissan networks. In other industries, the Japanese cling to their own product even if it is not obviously superior. This seems to have happened with rice; thanks to a poor harvest, Japan agreed to relax its ban on rice imports, only to find that consumers were not buying foreign, especially Thai, rice. The Ministry of Agriculture has now decreed that Japanese rice should be mixed with foreign rice--perhaps the first time a regulation has forced up imports.
President Clinton is gaining a reputation for making threats in trade negotiations as readily as he then makes concessions at the 11th hour. Super 301 looks like a promise to Congress to get tough on unfair trade. It is a promise that Congress will not allow him to forget; and therefore one that he and, even more, American consumers, might come to regret.","Some things never change .

 Does Super 301 therefore work ? Despite its prefix , it is technically little different from "" normal "" section 301 , an old provision of American trade law that allows individuals or the government to retaliate against "" unjustifiable , unreasonable or discriminatory "" traders abroad . Super 301 , which was invented in 1988 , adds to this a rigid timetable , which is meant to prevent the president from being soft on foreigners by quietly dropping suits . 
 Mr Clinton still has as much as two years to decide how tough to be . At the end of March , America will publish a list of "" unfair "" trading practices . Six months later it will begin to investigate a few of the most serious cases . And three weeks after that , the 301 complaints can become formal . The aim is to negotiate better deals long before retaliatory sanctions are actually imposed . 
 The chart below , from an analysis of American trade policy in 1975 - 90 by Patrick Low , an economist now working at the World Bank , shows the outcome of all section 301 investigations ( including "" Special 301 "" , a third category aimed at protecting American intellectual property).(chart omitted ) Overall the record is poor : liberalisation occurred in only a third of cases and retaliation in a tenth . Section 301 has been most successful against Japan and South Korea , achieving its aim 68 % of the time . However , the record of Super 301 , which has been used against only India , Brazil and Japan , is much worse . It has achieved minimal liberalisation for maximum trade friction . Super 301 's overtly political rhetoric , which America regards as a strength , is seen abroad as a liability ( nobody likes being seen to be kicked about ) . 
 Mr Low 's analysis comes with a sting in the tail . Even in the cases where 301 worked , the victory was often Pyrrhic . For a start , an adhesive trade policy undermines existing American trade . And the "" liberalisation "" that does occur has sometimes taken the form of market - sharing arrangements , such as the semi - conductor trade agreement , that hurt American consumers more than they benefit American producers . 
 Super 301 was conceived at a time when America had lost patience with the GATT 's barely functioning dispute - settlement system . Although it explicitly says that America must use the GATT wherever possible , the provision still has a unilateral bent . The Uruguay round , which was concluded in December , has now changed the environment by bringing new areas of trade under the jurisdiction of a new World Trade Organisation ( WTO ) . It also overhauled dispute settlement . 
 There are still potential offenders , such as China , which is not yet a GATT member , that Super 301 could be fired at ; there are also areas , such as parts of government procurement , that the Uruguay round does not cover . But to the usual targets , including Japan and the European Union , Super 301 looks , at best , like an elaborate way to channel disputes into the WTO . 
 That would sit uncomfortably beside the aggressive rhetoric that Mr Clinton 's trade policy encourages -- especially if America feels that the WTO 's disciplines can not touch Japan 's "" structural "" trade barriers . At worst , therefore , Super 301 could become a perverse pursuit of unilateralism , breaching the promises to be initialled at the formal signing of the Uruguay round in Morocco next month . That would blast apart the WTO before it has even begun . 
 Beyond all these worries is the potential effect of Mr Clinton 's unboat diplomacy on Japanese deregulation . Deregulation is picking apart structural barriers to foreign trade and investment in Japan far faster than any trade negotiators . True , further deregulation might not affect the size of Japan 's massive trade surplus with the rest of the world ( which depends upon the country 's savings and investment , not on trade barriers ) . But it would cure many of America 's biggest individual gripes . Opening the car market , for instance , might go a long way towards placating the administration , since this sector accounts for two - thirds of America 's bilateral deficit . 
 PAPER TIGER 
 Since Morihito Hosokawa became Japan 's prime minister last August , officialdom has been goaded into action . The Ministry of Transport , for example , often regarded as a a fierce over - regulator , is about to open an office in Detroit so that cars can be inspected as they leave the factory , rather than when a they land at Yokohama . But in most areas , real loosening has yet to begin . The Ministry of Finance has reformed the insurance market , but only in minor ways . The juiciest bits of the business -- life , car , fire and commercial insurance -- remain closed to foreign competition . 
 This patchy record reflects conflicts in side Japan 's political establishment . Many younger bureaucrats genuinely favour deregulation . Older ones are more conservative . If it is given free rein , self - interest should build up momentum behind reform . Moran Stanley , an American investment bank , estimates that the effects of regulation on trade cost Japan almost Y11 trillion ( $ 105 billion ) a year . 
 The revival of Super 301 threatens to block further deregulation . If Japan politely refuses to make further concessions to of America , tensions between the two countries could worsen , weakening Morihito Hosokawa's thus slowing reform . If instead Japan agrees to America 's demands and introduces import targets , the of outcome would doubtless be hailed as a victory for Super 301 . Yet it would still frustrate America 's underlying aims , because managed targets mean stronger bureaucrats , which implies less deregulation . 
 Naturally , deregulation will not guarantee higher American exports . One reason why Detroit 's car makers sold only 20,000 cars in Japan last year was that , unlike Germany 's Mercedes - Benz and BMW , they have not set up dealer networks ; Ford is sidestepping this by extending its arrangement 's to deal through the Toyota and Nissan networks . In other industries , the Japanese cling to their own product even if it is not obviously superior . This seems to have happened with rice ; thanks to a poor harvest , Japan agreed to relax its ban on rice imports , only to find that consumers were not buying foreign , especially Thai , rice . The Ministry of Agriculture has now decreed that Japanese rice should be mixed with foreign rice -- perhaps the first time a regulation has forced up imports . 
 President Clinton is gaining a reputation for making threats in trade negotiations as readily as he then makes concessions at the 11th hour . Super 301 looks like a promise to Congress to get tough on unfair trade . It is a promise that Congress will not allow him to forget ; and therefore one that he and , even more , American consumers , might come to regret .",740,Japan,A29-8188,IN TERM,True,Morihiro Hosokawa,3,True

IT WAS a new twist in Japan's long saga of political scandals. On March 11th, after Kishiro Nakamura learnt that he was being accused of corruption, he turned himself in, and apparently timed his arrest so that it could be watched live on prime-time television. The Japanese may not care for the damage that scandal has done to their political system, but they can hardly complain about the entertainment it provides.
Mr Nakamura, who was construction minister in the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) government that lost office last July, was charged with receiving a bribe of Y10m ($100,000) from Kajima, a civil-engineering company. Kajima was part of a cartel known as the Saitama Saturday Association, which was allegedly involved in rigging bids for a dam-building project in Saitama, Mr Nakamura's home base.
This was the first occasion in almost three decades that a member of Japan's parliament had had his collar felt while the assembly was in session. The first, but maybe not the last. On March 15th Tokyo's public prosecutors said they wanted to question Takashi Inoue, a member of the upper house and head of the National Land Agency when Mr Nakamura was a minister. On March 16th the Asahi Shimbun alleged that Kiichi Miyazawa, the prime minister at the time, was involved too. Mr Miyazawa has denied it.
Construction cartels were common during the years of the building boom. Japanese public-works projects were not the only sufferers. On March 14th the American government claimed it was the victim of a cartel in connection with contracts at its naval base at Atsui. It is preparing to seek damages of Y1 billion from the companies involved.
Mr Nakamura seems an unlikely victim: he is young (44) and widely regarded as thoughtful. The classic image of the recipient of a construction back-hander is Kakuei Tanaka, a thuggish building contractor who clawed his way to the prime minister's office and ended up in prison. And, for a Japanese bribe, Y10m is peanuts.
All this can only benefit Morohiro Hosokawa, the embattled prime minister. It helps to remind people of the days when Japan was a one-party state run by mutual back-scratchers in the LDP. It also distracts attention from stories about Mr Hosokawa. In 1979, before he became governor of Kumamoto prefecture, a mansion owned by his family was renovated, allegedly at a cost of Y1 billion, by Kiyoshi Sagawa, the head of a trucking company. Three years later he received Y100m from Mr Sagawa to finance the election campaign that made him governor. Mr Hosokawa says that the money was paid back with interest; but he has yet to produce evidence.","TOKYO

This hardly seems the most auspicious time for America to lead regional diplomacy on North Korea, which has barred United Nations inspectors from part of its nuclear plant at Yongbyon. It is a mark of America's continued strength in Asia that the joint diplomacy is proceeding smoothly.
The surface, admittedly, looks rough. On March 17th James Woolsey, President Clinton's director of central intelligence, declared that North Korea was not merely building missiles that could hit neighbours like Japan; it showed signs of wanting to sell these missiles to Arab states, which might point them at Europe. Four days later the American administration announced that Patriot missiles would be deployed in South Korea, and that the two countries would this year repeat the joint military exercise known as Team Spirit. Both measures infuriated the North Koreans.
The South Koreans and Japanese, by contrast, shrink from such things. They say they are not sure whether the North has a nuclear bomb; and that tough talk might make the North Koreans desperate. The South Korean line, however, seems to be toughening. On March 23rd the defence minister, Rhee Byoung Tae, suggested that if the North attacked the South would invade: ""We would make it an opportunity to realise unification.""
China is even further from America's hard line. Although China is privately angered by the North Koreans' delinquency, it does not like watching America trying to discipline its old ally. Economic links remain strong: China still supplies three-quarters of North Korea's oil and food imports. Official visitors trundle back and forth between the two sides, making speeches about the eternal bonds of communist brotherhood.
Yet despite the distance between Asian and American rhetoric on the issue, there is surprising unanimity about action. Mr Clinton's apparently tough measures were designed not to panic North Korea. Patriot missiles, after all, are defensive: they intercept incoming missiles. Besides, they have been dispatched by sea, not air; if North Korea decided to accept full inspection of its nuclear sites, the ships might presumably turn round and head for home. The date for the Team Spirit manoeuvres has not yet been set; these too could be cancelled if North Korea gave round.
The Asians, for their part, are coming to accept that, after a year of argument with North Korea, it may be time for the United Nations to consider limited trade sanctions. The Japanese are considering how they could cut off the help North Korea gets from its 250,000 or so sympathisers among Japan's Korean community; sackfuls of yen--on some estimates as much as $660m-1 billion--are dispatched regularly to North Korea by ferry.
The Chinese are less keen on a trade embargo, not least because the central government doubts its ability to enforce one on the provincial authorities that profit from North Korean contacts. But the Chinese did abstain on March 21st when the International Atomic Energy Agency, the UN's nuclear watchdog, adopted a resolution referring the issue back to the UN Security Council. This was progress, for last year it voted against such a resolution.
The Chinese are not in a mood to get tough with North Korea merely to please America, which is badgering them on human rights. But their prime minister, Li Peng, did listen politely to Japan's prime minister, Morihiro Hosokawa, who used a trip to Beijing on March 20th to urge firmness. Japan is China's leading trading partner, its biggest aid donor, and one of its biggest sources of private investment. Japan's views ought to count, especially as the Japanese are due to make a decision soon on whether to extend their aid programme.
South Korea's president, Kim Young Sam, arrives in China on March 26th and will reinforce the plea for firmness. Even if the Chinese cannot be persuaded to back a UN resolution censuring North Korea, they may well have some sharp words with their old friends in private, and Chinese pressure may yield some North Korean concessions. The Chinese have no interest in a nuclear North Korea, not least because that might encourage Japan to go nuclear itself.
China would far rather see good relations between North and South Korea: the South, argues a pro-China newspaper published in Hong Kong, should invest in the North, just as Hong Kong has developed China's southern provinces. North Korea's leader, Kim Il Sung, has toured China to study economic liberalisation and North Korea has already begun to set up its version of China's special economic zones.
However the North Korean issue is resolved, the diplomacy surrounding it is revealing a change in the region. Rather than making all its arguments itself, America is getting help from local friends in putting its case to China; in this sense, its style in the region is coming to resemble its style in Western Europe. And the locals are exhibiting a new unity.
Only a few years ago, China had no relations with South Korea and tricky ones with Japan; South Korea and Japan were divided by colonial memories. Now these three countries are working more or less together. South Korea is openly admitting that it needs Japanese technology to keep its economy moving fast; Japan has apologised to Korea for its past brutality. China's opening has multiplied economic links with both South Korea and Japan. North-East Asia has no Jacques Delors to make speeches about this; but then Asians are more interested in reality than in rhetoric.","America's friendship with Japan is clouded by a trade row; its links with China are dominated by an argument over human rights.

The Japanese used to feel proud of their high literacy and numeracy; now they fret that children suffer too much pressure from exams. They used to exult in their work ethic; now they worry that self-sacrificing drudgery is the wrong way to compete against America's more innovative firms. The most troubling self-doubt concerns Japan's tradition of stable employment, for a rise in lay-offs and joblessness could threaten the social stability that sets Japan apart from most of the rich world.
Recession, however, seems to be drawing to an end. In the last three months of 1994, consumer spending was up 0.7% on the previous quarter. January's industrial production was up 0.9% on December's. Corporate profits are still falling, but more slowly than before. Few expect real GDP to grow by more than 1% this year; but most reckon it will at least exceed the 0.1% growth recorded in 1993.
Confidence in Japan's social institutions may also be returning. The recent Detroit summit on unemployment reminded Japan of the alternative to its own employment system: in the European Union, one in ten workers is without a job. The growth of long-term unemployment is particularly worrying, since those out of work for a long time often et demoralised and give up the search for a job, so they do not exert downward pressure on wages. As a result, wages and unemployment both ratchet upwards. Japan's labour market, say some economists, works better because companies cut working hours and pay rises rather than staff numbers.
In return for job security, Japan's workers have accepted that wages may fall in hard times. This flexibility was on display in the annual wage round concluded at the end of March; unions and managers announced that they had settled on rises smaller than any since nationwide talks were instituted in the 1950s.
The headline figure--a 3% rise--still looked high, because inflation is low or negative. But the headline figure is a polite fiction during recessions, since it does not apply to bonuses. Last year these were cut, with the result that, although the spring wage round lifted monthly pay by 3.9%, total wages rose by only 0.6%. This year's real pay increase will probably turn out to be of a similar size.
Flexible wages, plus the brightening news on the economy, lead some patriotic Japanese to believe that their employment system will survive the recession intact. But the loss of confidence in another part of Japan's economic model will test their faith severely. In the past, super-efficient manufacturers drove Japan's growth, while regulated (mainly service) industries mopped up excess workers.
The resulting trade surplus has caused a row with America and pushed the yen so high that even super-efficient manufacturers have trouble competing abroad. The government's solution is to deregulate, thus encouraging laggard industries to contribute to innovation and economic growth as well as cooling the row with America by helping foreigners to sell in Japan.
To be sure, deregulation is difficult. On March 29th Morihiro Hosokawa, the prime minister, announced a package intended to pacify the Americans. It avoided setting the numerical targets on imports that the Americans had demanded, but offered a review of government procurement policies in medical and telecommunications equipment, and of the motor industry's parts buying practices. Mickey Kantor, the American trade representative, dismissed the package as a ""half-finished work"" that did not solve the problem.
Still, economic revival, accelerated by higher public spending and tax cuts, is expected to reduce Japan's trade surplus from 3.1% of GDP in the fiscal year just ended to 2.8% next year. A shrinking trade surplus would solve one political problem, but could create another. Put together the effect of the high yen on exports and rowing competition in the domestic market as a result of deregulation, and the implications for employment could be grim.
Japan has 15m manufacturing workers; America, with twice the population, has 17m. This is because 28% of Japan's output consists of manufacturing, compared with just 16% of America's. Japan's concentration on manufacturing is possible only because it exports so much of its manufactured output. Now that politics and a strong yen are conspiring to push exports down, the exporters seem bound to shrink.
Can the rest of the economy absorb more workers? Deregulation should make the economy work better in the long run, but in the short term it may force job cuts. In retailing, one area where deregulation has already made progress, labour-intensive family shops are giving way to neon-lit convenience stores manned by solitary students; in agriculture, farmers who wrap apples still growing on the tree will be replaced by cheaper rivals who are less fanatical about deterring insects.
This will bring down prices, freeing spending power which should, eventually, boost demand for other goods. In the meantime, if firms are to maintain employment, they will have to cut nominal wages to compensate for this deflation.

Some dodgy loans are made and dubious share deals done. A decade later the politician finds himself in charge of his country--a white hope from the provinces, untainted by the sleaze of the capital. But after an auspicious star, things start to go wrong, and little can be heard except the flapping of chickens coming home to roost.
Those who urge Japan to be more like the West must find irony in the similarity between the political troubles of Morihiro Hosokawa and Bill Clinton. But in Japan it is no laughing matter. The scandal enveloping its prime minister is paralysing the government. It cannot even get its budget passed, let alone deal sensibly with such irritations as Mickey Kantor and Kim Il Sung.
The scandal began with the friendship between Mr Hosokawa and Kiyoshi Sagawa. Mr Sagawa ran a trucking company in Kyoto. His friendship with Mr Hosokawa began in 1979 when he rented, and lavishly renovated, the Hosokawa family mansion at Kumamoto on the southern island of Kyushu. Then, in September 1982, he gave Mr Hosokawa Y100m ($401,000).
What happened after this is a matter of dispute. Mr Hosokawa says that the money was a personal loan and was repaid in full before the end of the year. His political enemies in Japan's Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) claim that it was an illegal contribution to Mr Hosokawa's (successful) campaign to become governor of Kumamoto prefecture. They have challenged Mr Hosokawa to support his story with documents, but the only one he has produced is a photocopied receipt for the money dated September 31st.
Reinventing the calendar is not the only sin of which Mr Hosokawa stands accused. In 1986 he is alleged to have bought 300 shares in the newly privatised Nippon Telegraph and Telephone. He denies this too. He says the deal was done by his late father-in-law, although he admits arranging a loan to help his father-in-law carry it through. By ordering so many shares, which cost Y1.19m each, he (or his father-in-law) was able to benefit from a preferential allocation not available to Japan's small investors. Partly as a result, a profit of Y50m was made when 199 of the shares were later sold.
It would not, in fact, have been illegal for Mr Hosokawa to have made the deal himself. The real scandal, according to the LDP critics, was that because he seems to have been embarrassed by the deal he tried to cover it up. Shuzo Fujiki, the investment consultant said to have arranged the deal, has stated publicly that Masatoshi Miyama, who was then Mr Hosokawa's secretary, asked him to conceal the transaction.
LDP men want Mr Hosokawa to produce documentary evidence that the Sagawa loan was repaid. They also want Mr Miyama to give evidence to parliament which, with Mr Hosokawa's support, he is refusing to do. Until these conditions are met, the party will not take part in discussions on Japan's budget, which was supposed to have been in place at the beginning of April. At the moment, the country is running on a stop-gap 50-day budget passed hurriedly before the deadline, but this will expire on May 20th.
Constitutionally, the government could ignore the LDP. But if it did so, the LDP would probably pull out of all parliamentary committees, creating an awkward crisis in Japan's consensus-based political life. So what will happen next is anybody's guess. Mr Hosokawa has not, yet, even been charged with any wrong-doing, let alone convicted. The LDP has been courting some of his coalition partners, particularly the Social Democratic Party, but none has agreed to desert him, so his government would almost certainly survive a vote of confidence. More likely he will simply be dropped by his erstwhile friends.
Mr Hosokawa has already antagonised one of his most powerful supportersthe cabinet secretary, Masayoshi Takemura--by very publicly trying and failing to sack him. At the moment, his strongest hopes for survival lie in the fact that his most likely replacement, Tsutomu Hata (foreign minister, and head of the Japan Renewal Party), is also unacceptable to Mr Takemura's win of the coalition. But any further scandal could change that. The men in grey kimonos may be calling round very soon.","It is the early 1980s . An ambitious local politician needs money .

With the resignation of Morihiro Hosokawa as prime minister, it looks depressingly as though the politicians who had promised change have proved incapable of delivering it. Yet things are not so bleak. In its short life Mr Hosokawa's government has already brought about some important reforms. And the current mess is happening not because change has stopped, but because it is continuing.
At first glance, the just-about-ruling coalition's record looks pretty miserable. All this year it has been so bogged down in disagreements that it has failed even to pass the annual budget: since April 1st the government has been paying its bills through a temporary 50-day budget. The discord has been so great that when, on April 8th, Mr Hosokawa resigned, no one quite knew whether he had gone because of shame or despair. He referred vaguely to a problem relating to investments made on his behalf by a friend. But that misdemeanor appears modest by the standards of Japan's corrupt politics, so many have concluded that financial embarrassment was an excuse, while the real reason was the awfulness of trying to run the government.
Things have got no better since Mr Hosokawa went: the leaders of the coalition's eight parties have failed to agree on a successor. But Mr Hosokawa can claim some important--possibly even historic--successes. The voting system, blamed for the corruption and absence of policy debate in Japanese politics, has been reformed. The new system reduces the temptations for candidates to bribe voters. At the same time, constituency boundaries are being redrawn. That is meant to weaken the power of constituency parties, which have grown expert at raising and distributing illegal campaign money. White envelopes stuffed with cash will matter less televised appeals to voters will count for more.
At the same time, the redrawing of boundaries will increase the clout of voters in towns at the expense of those in the countryside, correcting an old imbalance and strengthening the voice of those who support consumer-oriented policies to deregulate the economy. Without such electoral reform, economic and political change was more or less impossible; with it, it is by no means inevitable but it is at least possible. Already Mr Hosokawa has begun to deliver the deregulation he promised in order both to bring down prices for consumers and to make it easier for foreigners to sell their goods in Japan. The rice market has been opened to imports. There are new rules on government procurement. The Fair Trade Commission has been given more powers against anti-competitive practices. A new breed of discount store is importing goods direct from foreign firms, by-passing the expensive middle men who traditionally made imports uncompetitive.
These changes have not been enough to placate Americans angry that they sell too few goods in Japan. But Japan has succeeded in improving relations with countries nearer to home. All in all, Japan is becoming more like a ""normal nation"", at ease with the outside world; that is how Ichiro Ozawa, the power behind the coalition government, puts it.
Not all the members of the coalition think that Japan should be deregulating and normalizing in these ways. Opposition from the Social Democratic Party and the New Harbinger Party led to the deadlock that helped persuade Mr Hosokawa to resin. A sign of failure? No, again a sign that Japan's politics are moving in the right direction--towards the two party system that Mr Ozawa says he wants to create.
The coalition came together because it agreed on one issue: that Japan's voting system needed to be reformed. Now that the reform bill has been passed, it is dividing publicly along policy lines--something undreamt of in the old days when a veil of consensus shrouded whatever small disputes there might have been inside the LDP. Modernisers, who favour deregulation at home and more assertiveness abroad, are lining up against traditionalists. Because the split between the modernisers and the traditionalists runs through both government and opposition, it is no surprise that the immediate result is chaos.
THE VOTE TO COME
Progress towards a government run by politicians and based on policy, rather than one run by bureaucrats and held together by money, was never likely to be swift or smooth. Mr Ozawa has been trying to prize away from the LDP a faction that agrees with him in order to be able to dispose of those in the coalition who do not. But it should be no surprise if the coalition succeeds in temporarily patching up its differences, choosing a new prime minister and stumbling on towards an election sometime later this year.
A messy few months may ensue. The reforms to the voting system are not yet in place, and the boundary commission has only just started work on redrawing the constituencies. An election held under the new rules should advance the cause of the modernisers. The faster they can be implemented, the better.
""Weak political leadership...is an imposition on other countries,"" says Mr Ozawa, in his book, ""Blueprint for a New Japan"". The Americans, trying to negotiate on trade with an ineffective government, would no doubt agree with him. But they should not conclude that his plan has failed, or that trusting Japan to change is a mistake. The work is in progress.","Among ordinary Japanese there is an air of disappoint ; among the old guard of the Liberal Democratic Party ( LDP ) , whose 38 - year grip on government was broken by the voters last July , glee .

Morihito Hosokawa referred vaguely to a problem relating to investments made on Morihito Hosokawa's behalf by a friend . But that misdemeanor appears modest by the standards of Japan 's corrupt politics , so many have concluded that financial embarrassment was an excuse , while the real reason was the awfulness of trying to run the government . 
 Things have got no better since Morihito Hosokawa went : the leaders of the coalition 's eight parties have failed to agree on a successor . But Morihito Hosokawa can claim some important -- possibly even historic -- successes . The voting system , blamed for the corruption and absence of policy debate in Japanese politics , has been reformed . The new system reduces the temptations for candidates to bribe voters . At the same time , constituency boundaries are being redrawn . That is meant to weaken the power of constituency parties , which have grown expert at raising and distributing illegal campaign money . White envelopes stuffed with cash will matter less televised appeals to voters will count for more . 
 At the same time , the redrawing of boundaries will increase the clout of voters in towns at the expense of those in the countryside , correcting an old imbalance and strengthening the voice of those who support consumer - oriented policies to deregulate the economy . Without such electoral reform , economic and political change was more or less impossible ; with it , it is by no means inevitable but it is at least possible . Already Morihito Hosokawa has begun to deliver the deregulation Morihito Hosokawa promised in order both to bring down prices for consumers and to make it easier for foreigners to sell their goods in Japan . The rice market has been opened to imports . There are new rules on government procurement . The Fair Trade Commission has been given more powers against anti - competitive practices . A new breed of discount store is importing goods direct from foreign firms , by - passing the expensive middle men who traditionally made imports uncompetitive . 
 These changes have not been enough to placate Americans angry that they sell too few goods in Japan . But Japan has succeeded in improving relations with countries nearer to home . All in all , Japan is becoming more like a "" normal nation "" , at ease with the outside world ; that is how Ichiro Ozawa , the power behind the coalition government , puts it . 
 Not all the members of the coalition think that Japan should be deregulating and normalizing in these ways . Opposition from the Social Democratic Party and the New Harbinger Party led to the deadlock that helped persuade Morihito Hosokawa to resin . A sign of failure ? No , again a sign that Japan 's politics are moving in the right direction -- towards the two party system that Mr Ozawa says he wants to create . 
 The coalition came together because it agreed on one issue : that Japan 's voting system needed to be reformed . Now that the reform bill has been passed , it is dividing publicly along policy lines -- something undreamt of in the old days when a veil of consensus shrouded whatever small disputes there might have been inside the LDP . Modernisers , who favour deregulation at home and more assertiveness abroad , are lining up against traditionalists . Because the split between the modernisers and the traditionalists runs through both government and opposition , it is no surprise that the immediate result is chaos . 
 THE VOTE TO COME 
 Progress towards a government run by politicians and based on policy , rather than one run by bureaucrats and held together by money , was never likely to be swift or smooth . Mr Ozawa has been trying to prize away from the LDP a faction that agrees with him in order to be able to dispose of those in the coalition who do not . But it should be no surprise if the coalition succeeds in temporarily patching up its differences , choosing a new prime minister and stumbling on towards an election sometime later this year . 
 A messy few months may ensue . The reforms to the voting system are not yet in place , and the boundary commission has only just started work on redrawing the constituencies . An election held under the new rules should advance the cause of the modernisers . The faster they can be implemented , the better . 
 "" Weak political leadership ... is an imposition on other countries , "" says Mr Ozawa , in his book , "" Blueprint for a New Japan "" . The Americans , trying to negotiate on trade with an ineffective government , would no doubt agree with him . But they should not conclude that his plan has failed , or that trusting Japan to change is a mistake . The work is in progress .",740,Japan,A29-8188,IN TERM,True,Morihiro Hosokawa,11,True

In addition to the firepower concentrated on the peninsula itself, America squared off against the Soviet Union from bases in Japan and the Philippines, and from the ships and submarines of the Seventh Fleet plying the Pacific Ocean. Large Chinese and Soviet armies faced each other across their disputed land border. Japan, formally ""pacifist"", built up one of the world's biggest and best equipped armed forces to support America.
Now, though the cold war may officially have ended, the crisis over North Korea's nuclear programme carries with it the distant threat of a war as destructive as any in Asia since Vietnam. The International Atomic Energy Agency's demand to inspect North Korea's nuclear facilities is being backed up by the United Nations Security Council; North Korea's refusals are coming in increasingly angry terms. The North's delegate to a routine truce-committee meeting told his Southern counterpart that Seoul, South Korea's capital, could be ""a sea of flames"". On April 5th, the North declared that war might ""break out at any moment"".
There are two big reasons for the rest of the world to be worrying about North Korea's nuclear program and the bumper harvest of plutonium which it may yield. The first is that the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) comes up for renewal next year, and if North Korea gets away with flouting its NPT obligations then there will be no stopping the likes of Iran and Iraq from going nuclear--especially with North Korea in the business of selling ballistic missiles and no doubt prepared, given the chance, to sell nuclear know-how and reprocessed plutonium. The second reason for wanting to block the North's programme is the effect that a nuclear; clear North Korea would have on the stability of East Asia. Today only China, Russia and the United States have nuclear weapons in the region. If North Korea were permitted to join this fairly respectable trio, Japan would be strongly tempted to go nuclear; South Korea and Taiwan might follow. A great East Asian arms race would be on.
So strong are these reasons for action that some think the West has been moving too timidly. France, for one, is thought to have pressed for a more robust response from the Security Council. But America has tempered the toughness of its own line in deference to the reluctance of East Asia's regional powers--China, Japan and South Korea--to lean hard on the North. To that extent, the North Korean crisis may be seen as marking a key stage in America-Asia relations: one at which America's presumption of a global security role extending across Asia confronts on more or less equal terms a different analysis and approach favoured by the Asian powers themselves.
The argument for caution in Korea is one which America--with 35,000 troops in South Korea--to some degree shares: it is based upon the fear of unnecessarily provoking North Korea into launching a conventional war against the South, with horrific consequences. America has thus embarked on a policy of active deterrence, sending Patriot anti-missile missiles to South Korea and planning to beef up its Forces in the vicinity. Arguably, it should also be making it clear in private that, if the North does strike, then America's war aim will be to destroy the North's regime and re-unify Korea under the South's government.
But deterrence, by raising the stakes of a possible war, is itself a high-risk course. It can be justified only if the benefits of having the North comply with NPT obligations are sufficiently compelling ones, and if toughness is the right way to win that compliance. This is where the North's neighbours hesitate, and the difference between American and Asian analyses becomes apparent.
The Asian reservations being with a doubt on the part of some governments in the region as to whether the North's nuclear efforts do in fact pose much of a threat at all. True, the North has been thumbing its nose at the NPT, but to what effect? Some reprocessed plutonium, even a warhead or two, does not mean much in the hands of a regime, however ill-intentioned, that lacks the means to deliver a bomb. The sceptics see in Kim I1 Sung's North Korea a decrepit government incapable of feeding its people, and cut off so completely from the currents of modernisation coursing through Asia that it is only a matter of time before the regime collapses. On this view, the North's nuclear programme is a bluff designed to win some foreign aid and Western recognition; it is not a serious military threat. The real danger, on this reading, is that over pressure on the North will set off a conventional Korean war-something that Kim II Sung's mad-house is certainly capable of producing in its last days.
This is a parochial approach to the problem, in that it ignores the global need to fight nuclear proliferation. But at least it represents a degree of difference between American and Asian analyses over which compromise has been possible so long as relations between the two camps have been relatively cordial. That much was evident when America, keen to keep China on side, accepted a Security Council ""statement"" on North Korea last month instead of a sanctions-threatening resolution.
The much deeper worry, however, is that the relatively good working relations between America and Asia, on which management of the Korean crisis has so far depended, are so patently fragile. Without going as far as Samuel Huntington, a Harvard professor, who argues that the next era of international relations will be marked by a ""clash of civilisations"" (principally those of the West, of Islam and of the Confucian world), it is easy enough to see that most East Asian governments pursue policies on the basis of assumptions often very different from the sort of assumptions that prevail in America and Western Europe. And, as those same East Asian governments grow more powerful in relative and absolute terms, friction with other countries is more likely to occur. Because of that increased scope for friction and misunderstanding, the United States needs to be especially clear about its interests in Asia. It also needs to recognise that, while the cost of getting Asia wrong could be very high, so could the rewards of getting it right.
What America lacks is a new vision of East Asia to displace the one it grew used to during the second half of the cold war. Then, following Richard Nixon's opening to Mao Zedong's China, the conventional strategic wisdom had, for all its superficial intricacies, a simplifying theme: containment of the Soviet Union. This security theme was played out against an economic background in which the United States not only boasted an economy considerably bigger than all of East Asia's, but was by far the biggest customer for Asian goods and the choicest destination for Asian (mostly Japanese) foreign investment.
ASIA'S TWO REVOLUTIONS
The security needs and the economic interests of the Asian region have since been undergoing radical changes: the former by virtue of the collapse of the Soviet Union, the latter with the extraordinary economic growth of East Asia, especially China, within the past 15 years. The suspension of the Russian military threat (few believe it is one for good) has opened the way for a period of peace and stability in the region--assuming for the moment that the North Korean business has a happy ending. This degree of optimism may seem surprising in view of the recent sharp increases in military spending in East Asia: China alone is to raise its defence spending by more than 20% in local-currency terms in the coming year. The region also has its share of ethnic antagonisms and border disputes. But if strife may indeed flow from such thins, it is unlikely to do so except in some localised instances for many years to come. The reason is that, for every government in East and South-East Asia save North Korea's, fast economic growth has become the overriding policy aim.
True, a preoccupation with economic growth does not in itself always make for peace. Over the centuries, plenty of countries have used military conquest as their preferred method of getting rich quick.
But imperial analogies are not the right ones for today's Asia. Asia after 1970 has been (so far) much like Europe in the four decades after 1870. During these happy years the world economy, anchored by the old standard and stimulated by the free international flow of people, goods and capital, enjoyed rates of growth that were not again equalled or surpassed until the 1950s. In Europe itself, peace was preserved through a balance of power that Britain took chief responsibility for maintaining.
East Asia enjoys today the same essential conditions for economic growth and stability that the countries on either side of the North Atlantic did in the late 19th century: a more-or-less free-trading regime and a balance of power preserved by an offshore giant (America this time) that has a strong interest in both an open world trading system and in the stability of its fastest-growing markets. Naturally, these advantages are fragile, as they proved to be in Europe when protectionism rose and the balance of power deteriorated after the turn of the century. But, fingers crossed, today's Asian governments do not favour military adventures as generators of wealth. Capital Bows and exports are the preferred vehicles.
China is the chief case in point. Its rowing military weight makes its neighbours nervous (which is one reason their defence spending is going up too), and China does not hesitate to throw that weight around a bit on matters such as its claim to the Spratly Islands in the South China Sea. But China is taking a long view. It intends to become the dominant power in Asia only in 20-30 years and a world power a generation after that.
The Chinese know that, if they are to achieve such a position, they must first build up an economy capable of sustaining such grand ambitions. To do that they need a long period of peace and stability. The same calculation is being made by other countries throughout Asia, including such formerly martial powers as Vietnam.
The intra-regional character of Asia's economic revolution should also help keep its constituent countries friendly with each other. Flows of trade and investment have reached levels that are beginning to make Asians economically more important to each other than America (or Europe) is to them. Kenneth Courtis, Deutsche Bank's chief economist in Tokyo, has calculated that in 1985 Japan exported a third more to America than it did to the rest of Asia; eight years (and a doubling in the dollar value of Japan's exports) later, Japan exported a third more to the rest of Asia than it did to America and two-and-a-half times as much to the rest of Asia as it did to the European Union. The rest of Asia has become Japan's biggest source of imports: some $60 billion-worth last year, compared with around $50 billion from America and $24 billion from the EU. And Asia now takes twice the share of Japanese foreign direct investment (FDI) that it took in the mid-1980s. South Korea, Taiwan, Hon Kong and Singapore are not far behind: Japan has accounted for a third of the past decade's FDI in South-East Asia, but these tiers represented another quarter.
With East Asia's economies rowing two to three times faster than America's or Europe's, Asia will probably account for nearly a quarter of gross world product in 2000 even in dollar terms (and far more on a purchasing-power basis). That would be six times its share in 1950. The economic implications are not hard to fathom. A calculation by the Bank of Japan shows that, already, the sensitivity of such Asian economies as Singapore's and South Korea's to changes in the American economy fell by half between 1970 and 1990. Perhaps it is not so surprising that when Morihiro Hosokawa, Japan's just-departed prime minister, visited Beijing last month shortly after a nasty clash between China and America over human rights, he volunteered that ""it is not proper to force a Western or European-style democracy on to others.""
PAX PACIFICA
The rise and maturing of Asia could also mean immense opportunities for America, which is valued by most Asian countries as an even-handed outsider that can be trusted to keep the balance of power among them. American companies, at least as well positioned as any rich-world multinationals to profit from Asia, are racing into the region. When Bill Clinton played host last November to a gaggle of Asian heads of state at the Asia-Pacific Economic Co-operation forum in Seattle, he made it clear that he understood Asia's potential for serving American interests, especially its economic ones. The question now is how far the Clinton administration can translate those general perceptions into an Asian policy with the coherence needed to protect both American interests and Asian stability.
Unfortunately, Mr Clinton seems to have difficulty choosing between two strains of policy that are increasingly at odds: the multilateral, free-trading, balance-of-power approach to Asia, the approach that Asian governments want to see; and the unilateral, protectionist, moralistic approach that enjoys strong support within Congress and from some American interest groups. So both approaches have been getting a work-out. Mr Hosokawa's precarious government was encouraged in its programme of deregulation, then rapped on the knuckles and told, in effect, to find new ways of regulating trade so that artificial ""numerical targets"" for American imports could be reached. China has been threatened with a trade war if it does not clean up its dreadful human-rights record, and at the same time wooed on behalf of American business for its investment and market potential and asked for help in dealing with North Korea. Indonesia is asked to be more hospitable to American investors, then threatened with a loss of trade preferences because it does too little to protect workers' rights. And so on.
Winston Lord, the State Department's East Asia man, was quoted as having told a recent meeting of American businessmen that the Clinton administration was trying to determine ""how to pursue multiple objectives with no clear hierarchy among them...National security had the priority before, but now it's hard to tell whether economics, or human rights or whatever else takes priority."" If there is any such confusion of objectives (and the country's behaviour certainly suggests there is) then America's foreign-policy makers are not doing their jobs properly. They should be deciding which national interests need to be given priority as well as how to pursue them.
The two places where clear-headedness is now most crucial are Japan (over trade) and China (over a lot of subjects). The managed-trade regime (sorry, ""objective indicators of progress"" regime) that America is seeking to impose on Japan could have terrible consequences for the world trading system, but at least this is on a fairly long fuse. In China's case, Mr Clinton has less than two months to decide whether America is deliberately going to make an enemy of China. It is not that America is wrong to press China on human rights: it is undoubtedly right to do so. But the chosen method, a threat to withdraw China's most-favoured-nation (MFN) trading status, is in many eyes a tool so unsuited to its purpose that using it would, as one American senator put it, be ""the trade equivalent of nuclear war"".
The signs are that the Clinton administration now sees that it set a trap for itself by saying last year that, unless China had made ""significant"" progress by June this year on specified human-rights subjects, MFN would be withdrawn. In the view of one Asian leader, a withdrawal of MFN would even invite the question: is America really ready to treat China as another Soviet Union and pay the price-financial, psychological and military-of containing it? Although such a view would find little or no echo in Washington, the administration would still like to find a way out. But with China tightening the screws provocatively on dissidents and journalists, it will not find one easily.
Were relations between America and the East Asian powers to worsen fundamentally, part of the price would be exacted on the Korean peninsula. So far, America has been proved correct in its assumption that the common security interest in a non-nuclear North Korea is sufficiently strong to prevent tensions over human rights (in China's case) and trade (in Japan's case) from destroying altogether the co-operation needed to mount a concerted challenge to the obstinacy of the North, provided that America is itself also prepared to adapt its approach. But a trade war with China would surely put an end to this co-operation; one with Japan might just do the same.
Judging what this interest is worth and weighing it against the costs of securing it is only one part of the thinking America needs to do about East Asia and its role there. By returning (and sticking) to the course of multilateral free trade, and continuing to act as East Asia's guarantor of a stable balance of power, America has the chance to help Asia avoid early in the next century the horrors that overtook Europe early this century and in the process to reap at least its share of what promises to be the most stupendous economic and business expansion ever seen. For that to happen, the Clinton administration will have to give a higher priority to the maintenance of good working relations with East Asian governments than it does to its impulses to take unilateral trade and human-rights action in the region. In the long run the first policy is the one that will secure a better life for everyone; and yet, given the sincere American disposition to imbue foreign policy with at least some moral character, that better course will be much the more difficult one for Mr Clinton to take.","Even at the height of the cold war , the area around the Korean peninsula was one of the world 's most complicated corners .

"" If there is any such confusion of objectives ( and the country 's behaviour certainly suggests there is ) then America 's foreign - policy makers are not doing their jobs properly . They should be deciding which national interests need to be given priority as well as how to pursue them . 
 The two places where clear - headedness is now most crucial are Japan ( over trade ) and China ( over a lot of subjects ) . The managed - trade regime ( sorry , "" objective indicators of progress "" regime ) that America is seeking to impose on Japan could have terrible consequences for the world trading system , but at least this is on a fairly long fuse . In China 's case , Mr Clinton has less than two months to decide whether America is deliberately going to make an enemy of China . It is not that America is wrong to press China on human rights : it is undoubtedly right to do so . But the chosen method , a threat to withdraw China 's most - favoured - nation ( MFN ) trading status , is in many eyes a tool so unsuited to its purpose that using it would , as one American senator put it , be "" the trade equivalent of nuclear war "" . 
 The signs are that the Clinton administration now sees that it set a trap for itself by saying last year that , unless China had made "" significant "" progress by June this year on specified human - rights subjects , MFN would be withdrawn . In the view of one Asian leader , a withdrawal of MFN would even invite the question : is America really ready to treat China as another Soviet Union and pay the price - financial , psychological and military - of containing it ? Although such a view would find little or no echo in Washington , the administration would still like to find a way out . But with China tightening the screws provocatively on dissidents and journalists , it will not find one easily . 
 Were relations between America and the East Asian powers to worsen fundamentally , part of the price would be exacted on the Korean peninsula . So far , America has been proved correct in its assumption that the common security interest in a non - nuclear North Korea is sufficiently strong to prevent tensions over human rights ( in China 's case ) and trade ( in Japan 's case ) from destroying altogether the co - operation needed to mount a concerted challenge to the obstinacy of the North , provided that America is itself also prepared to adapt its approach . But a trade war with China would surely put an end to this co - operation ; one with Japan might just do the same . 
 Judging what this interest is worth and weighing it against the costs of securing it is only one part of the thinking America needs to do about East Asia and its role there . By returning ( and sticking ) to the course of multilateral free trade , and continuing to act as East Asia 's guarantor of a stable balance of power , America has the chance to help Asia avoid early in the next century the horrors that overtook Europe early this century and in the process to reap at least its share of what promises to be the most stupendous economic and business expansion ever seen . For that to happen , the Clinton administration will have to give a higher priority to the maintenance of good working relations with East Asian governments than it does to its impulses to take unilateral trade and human - rights action in the region . In the long run the first policy is the one that will secure a better life for everyone ; and yet , given the sincere American disposition to imbue foreign policy with at least some moral character , that better course will be much the more difficult one for Mr Clinton to take .",740,Japan,A29-8188,IN TERM,True,Mr Hosokawa 's precarious government,4,True

The first non-Liberal Democratic government in 38 years has proved incapable of government. No replacement is likely to be cleaner or more cohesive. Thus runs the popular cynicism in Tokyo, after the announcement on April 8th by the prime minister, Morihiro Hosokawa, that he would resign over a financial scandal. Yet the truth is rather less depressing. Ever since electoral reform was enacted by parliament in March, Japan has been engaged in a second and no less worthwhile stage of its political reconstruction.
Mr Hosokawa's announcement on April 8th probably owed less to scandal than to policy. He has admitted receiving interest on a loan from Tokyo Sagawa Kyubin, a delivery company, and some unspecified irregularities in share dealing. None of this is recent; none involves big sums by the standards of Japan's politics; none is quite enough to explain his resignation. To see why, consider Mr Hosokawa's allies.
When Ichiro Ozawa, the power behind the coalition, was accused of corruption last year, he calmly declared that his past misbehaviour was proof of the need to reform politics. That misbehaviour involved raising cash for the Takeshita faction, the corrupt heart of the corrupt Liberal Democratic Party (LDP). Half of that faction later formed the Japan Renewal Party, which has supplied five of Mr Hosokawa's cabinet colleagues: it is a fair bet that all have more to be ashamed of than the departing prime minister. One of the five, Tsutomu Hata, seemed, at mid-week, likely to succeed Mr Hosokawa.
The real reason for Mr Hosokawa's resignation lies in the aftermath of his success in shoving electoral reform through parliament. The prime minister lost no time in announcing plans to reform Japan's clumsy tax system, which penalises salaried workers and favours the self-employed and the retired. To widen the tax net, Mr Hosokawa promised to shift the tax burden from incomes to consumption.
This angered the Social Democratic Party, the largest member of Mr Hosokawa's eight-party coalition, since consumption taxes are hard on the poorer Japanese who traditionally support it. The reform proposal also enraged Masayoshi Takemura, the leader of the New Harbinger Party, who stormed unannounced into Mr Hosokawa's office and screamed at him.
In the weeks that followed, Mr Hosokawa tried and failed to evict Mr Takemura from the cabinet. Mr Takemura and the Social Democrats withdrew support for Mr Hosokawa's modernising policies. Aside from tax reform, these include economic deregulation and a more assertive foreign policy.
Thus paralysed, Mr Hosokawa saw little virtue in staying on. So he resigned, hoping to build an alliance that could resume the business of reform later. And although the coalition seems likely to try to soldier on towards an election, the intrigue triggered by Mr Hosokawa's move has shown what a future pro-reform alliance might look like.
On the day he resigned, Mr Hosokawa launched a new parliamentary group called Reform. Rumours soon spread that the Hata-Ozawa Japan Renewal Party would join the Reform group, along with the Clean Government Party. The latter has no policies but lots of money to pay for election campaigning.
These three parties would give the Reform group around 150 members, about 100 short of the number required to form a majority in the lower house of parliament. To plug the gap, Mr Ozawa proposed to recruit Michio Watanabe, a Liberal Democratic baron; Mr Watanabe's vigorous foreign-policy views fit well with the Reformers. For two days Mr Watanabe tried to persuade enough party colleagues to join him. He failed. As a result, the Reform gang seems to have resigned itself to sticking with the old coalition for the moment.
While the shape of a future modernising party could thus be glimpsed, so too could that of a traditionalist opposition. The New Harbingers and Social Democrats were canvassing support from other Liberal Democratic groups that share the view that Japan should stick by its pacifist constitution. Kiichi Miyazawa, a former prime minister, is a prominent LDP traditionalist. The Social Democrats and Liberal Democrats both have rural supporters who dislike deregulation of agriculture. In this they stand opposed to the urban-based Reformers.
Both wins of the LDP seem, for the moment, to have decided not to defect. The party remains easily Japan's biggest. By sticking together it may regain power at the next election. Yet the LDP's unity is soon to face a test. The redrawing of constituency boundaries, which should be completed this autumn, will oblige the party's bosses to sever some parliamentarians from their old districts. The new boundaries' victims will make ready recruits for other parties.","The country 's cleanest politician is dirty after all .

In January the Nikkei 300 index plunged 4.8% on the news that political reform had floundered; in February it fell 3.1% after an America-Japan trade summit ended without agreement. Some investors expected another slide when Japan's prime minister, Morihiro Hosokawa, announced his intention to resign on April 8th; Over the next two trading days, however, the Nikkei 300 dipped a mere 1.0%. On April 13th it bounced up again.
This is impressive, since the latest political upset appeared hardly less serious than previous ones. In the aftermath of Mr Hosokawa's announcement it seemed that the budget, already delayed, might be postponed further, and with it some of the public spending designed to boost the weak economy. Besides, government paralysis hampers Japan's efforts to open its economy and so stave off American trade sanctions. If the economy stays closed then the Americans may also talk up the yen, squeezing the profits of Japan's big exporters.
The stockmarket's resilience in the face of such terrors will encourage eager foreigners. In the whole of 1993, foreigners made net purchases of Japanese shares worth Y1.4 trillion ($12.6 billion); in the first quarter of this year they grabbed Y3.2 trillion-worth. This partly reflected sensible fears about other Asian markets. But it was also based on two more controversial views: that Japan's corporate profits were set to recover, and that domestic investors would soon pile into the market.
Profits probably will recover, even though much of the economic news still sounds fairly gloomy. On April 12th the finance minister, Hirohisa Fujii, said it was too early to be sure that the economy had bottomed. Nobody expects the recovery to be strong when it comes. Deregulation and a discount boom are pushing down the prices that firms can charge; the strong yen dampens revenues from foreign markets.
The good news from the corporate sector is that costs are falling. Japan's recession has brought few ostentatious sacking, but firms have used early retirement, recruitment freezes and cuts in overtime to economise on wages. Smart firms have also used the property crash to renegotiate rents. Production has been shifted from expensive Japanese sites to cheap foreign ones. Capital costs are falling too, because firms have by now refinanced most of the Y23.9 trillion in warrant bonds issued in 1987-91. Warrant expires peaked last year at around Y10 trillion; this year's lot will come to half that.
All this should help profits. Yet Japan's shares are trading on a prospective price/earning ratio of about 85. Even if profits soared, the market would remain much more highly rated than, say, Wall Street. If a rally is to materialise, the foreign bulls' second assumption will have to prove true: Japanese investors will have to buy their own market.
THE INSURANCE LIABILITY
Tokyo's stockmarket is plagued by determined sellers, however. Industrial companies are dumping the shares they accumulated as cross-holdings during the heady 1980s. This is partly because they need the cash, and partly because they see less advantage in the long-term business relationships that the cross-holdings were supposed to reinforce.
Banks are selling cross-holdings too. In the past, banks held customers' shares partly to make up for high interest rates they charged on loans. Now that loan rates have grown more competitive, and big customers rely less on loans than on securities, the banks reckon it is time to dump their shares. Besides, capital-adequacy rules, plus the burden of bad loans, make banks reluctant to devote scarce capital to holding shares whose dividend yield averages 0.8, well below the banks' cost of funds.
Most analysts reckon that Y6 trillion or so of cross-shareholdings may be dumped on the market this year; on top of that, a slight pick-up in fresh share issues could supply a further Y3 trillion to the market. For the past year or so bulls have argued that this selling would be absorbed by Japanese investors fleeing low returns on other instruments.
This seems a weak argument just now. Even though the official discount rate is at a record low of 1.75%, ten-year bond yields have shot up to around 4%. But the bigger problem with the bullish argument is less obvious. Even if bond yields fall, Japan's life insurers are unlikely to buy equities.
As the biggest investors in Japan, life insurers feel a duty to sound positive about the market. They issue encouraging pronouncements at the start of each financial year; recently three big firms said they would allocate about 10% of their new funds to equities. In the 1980s that would have meant a lot of cash, since insurance assets were growing by 20% annually. These days, however, the growth rate has fallen by around half: insurers' new cash flow now comes to a bit over Y12 trillion a year.
Besides, the life insurers often prove far less bullish than their spring-time statements; last year, in fact, they turned out to be net sellers. It would be comforting to think that this will change as soon as equities look more attractive. Andrew Smithers, a London-based economist, reckons that the structure of life insurers' liabilities makes this unlikely.
Unlike British life insurers, whose products offer lowish guaranteed returns plus the hope of big unguaranteed bonuses, Japan's insurers guarantee high pay-outs. To match this promise, they need a guaranteed income. With dividend yields at a lowly 0.8%, equities do not provide that. Insurers can sensibly allocate money to equities only if they already hold enough bonds to cover future liabilities.
At present they do not; Mr Smithers and Tillinghast, an actuarial firm, reckon that life insurers need to earn a 4.96% return on their assets in order to meet their liabilities, whereas their returns in the year to March 1993 were only 4.3%. Yet Mr Smithers calculates that, by shifting short-term deposits and equity funds into bonds, insurers' portfolios could be made to yield a comfortable 5.3%, even if bond yields fell to 3.6%. Expect Japan's life insurers to carry on talking up the market, while taking every chance to sell.","Politics seems to have lost some of its power to scare Japan 's stockmarket .

That is the view of one young parliamentarian, who also describes Yohei Kono, another contender for the leadership, as a coward. But for Tsutomu Hata there is only praise. The man who by mid-week seemed almost certain to lead Japan has survived years in politics without making enemies.
Mr Hata has a hard act to follow. Morihiro Hosokawa, the outgoing prime minister, had the fortune to follow 38 years of unbroken rule by the corrupt Liberal Democratic Party (LDP). That, plus a telegenic smile, gave him record ratings in opinion polls. Late last year more than 70% said they supported his cabinet, compared with the 10% that backed the LDP during its last months in power.
These days it is harder to be popular. Eight months of non-LDP government have coincided with recession. Although Mr Hosokawa did keep several of his promises--electoral reform, an apology for Japan's war crimes, some deregulation--his term ended amid bickering among coalition allies and financial scandal. Mr Hosokawa's appeal owed much to his background as a provincial governor, which set him apart from the cynical dealings of the capital. Mr Hata has spent nearly all his career in national politics.
Mr Hata's cabinet and policies will hardly differ from his predecessor's. He will also be just as vulnerable to coalition bickering. The most divisive issue is tax reform, which delayed Mr Hata's anointment for several days. His Japan Renewal Party wants to raise the consumption tax to tap the growing ranks of retired people; his Social Democratic coalition allies object.
Other disagreements lurk beneath the surface. Mr Hata's party wants Japan to help put pressure on North Korea to allow nuclear inspections; the Social Democrats, for their part, have a soft spot for the North Koreans. Mr Hata's party would like to increase Japan's military contributions to United Nations peacekeeping; the Social Democrats favour stricter allegiance to Japan's pacifist constitution.
Behind these issues lies a more philosophical division, between defenders of Japan's post-war order and believers in rapid change. Mr Hata's pro-change camp, which includes Mr Hosokawa, wants to scrap the regulations that suited a catch-up economy geared towards exports; Japan is now rich, and its export success has become embarrassing. Likewise, the Hata camp's activist foreign policy reflects the sense that rich Japan must shoulder more responsibility. But conservatives--Liberal Democrats on the right, Social Democrats on the left--feel that Japan has been well served by regulation and pacifism, so should stick to them.
Splinter groups offer variants on this division. On April 18th Shokei Arai, a young Liberal Democrat who had supported Mr Watanabe's bid for the leadership, left the LDP with four friends to set up something called the Liberal Party. Mr Arai says that internationalisation, though good, is causing the Japanese to lose their identity. Mr Arai favours Confucian family values.
Thirty years ago Japanese homes featured shrines to the ancestors; these days, he laments, youngsters are indifferent. Mr Arai proposes to cut Japan's exorbitant inheritance taxes: children should inherit the family wealth, provided they look after parents in their dotage. Schools should concentrate less on academic tests and more on instilling morality, says Mr Arai, voicing popular disgust with cramming.
Economic and foreign-policy reforms, coupled perhaps with cultural conservatism, seem likely to win. Mr Hosokawa has launched a parliamentary group called Reform that may become a full-blown party, comprising his Japan New Party, Mr Hata's Renewalists, the Buddhist-linked Clean Government Party and various defectors. Isamu Ueda, a Clean Government man, says that 90% of his colleagues are ready to bury the Clean Government name and join the Hosokawa group.
The other side is less organised. The LDP used to be held together by the money and patronage that came with power; Yohei Kono, the party leader, is not a man to compensate for these lost glues through force of personality. The Social Democrats are riven by disagreement, and confused by the collapse of the communist regimes with which they used to sympathise. Both parties suffer a steady trickle of defections.
This ferment may yield coherent parties one day, but for the moment Mr Hata--assuming he gets the job--will worry more about everyday government. A budget needs to be pushed through parliament. The Americans, furious about their trade deficit with Japan, need to be placated with measures to boost Japanese demand and so suck in imports. The vast job of deregulation has barely been started. With a divided coalition and troubles like these, it may not be enough to be the man without enemies.","It is a good thing that Michio Watanabe , who has said that Chinese live in holes and that blacks pollute American suburbs , failed to become Japan 's next prime minister ; indeed Mr Watanabe should wash his raceless mouth with soap .

The more unpleasant the face in the mirror, the more vital it is to look at it. ""Never again"" and ""know thyself"" remain handy maxims for just about every country under the sun. None is without skeletons. But how to overcome a natural reluctance to take them out of the cupboard?
The Germans have achieved a remarkable feat of collective self-analysis and contrition. That painful process--still going on, with the viewing in Germany of the film ""Schindler's List""--has helped to create an exemplary democracy and a nation generally sensitive to the fears of foreigners.
The Russians have done less well. True, during the Gorbachev era, the belated exposure of crimes committed in the name of a totalitarian regime played a valuable part in bringing about the collapse of communism. True, Russian historians can now dig into the archives and reveal the horrors that were kept out of the national consciousness, and therefore its conscience. But there is still no public self-examination, in the German manner, of the extent to which millions of Russians were complicit in Stalin's crimes.
Other countries have found it no easier to master the art of mea culpa. Japan's just-ex prime minister, Morihiro Hosokawa, courageously admitted a wider measure of collective guilt for Japan's war crimes, but the Japanese have yet to look that history straight in the eye. Italy's crimes during the fascist era were less horrific in scale, but as a nation Italy has avoided the kind of collective self-analysis engaged in by the Germans.
The task of self-examination is even harder in countries, such as France, where the post-1945 issue is not so much the initiation of crimes as collaboration in the crimes of others. The wounds caused by brother betraying brother often go deeper than those inflicted by an external foe. So it is understandable that politicians, from de Gaulle to Mitterrand, should wish to draw a veil over the squalor and dwell instead upon la gloire. Yet when the victors look back this summer to celebrate their D-day landings 50 years ago, their view of the past will surely be more honest than it would have been had not Paul Touvier, a Frenchman, just been convicted of wartime crimes against humanity. Whatever the shortcomings of a trial so long after the event, the introspection it has inspired should help to stifle the crowing.
Raking over the past is never pleasant, but to forget the lessons of history is worse. Nationalism, racism and hostility to immigrants have risen in much of Europe. Mussolini's heirs are coming back to government in Italy. Vladimir Zhirinovsky has done alarmingly well in Russia. This is a time to remember the evils of rampant nationalism, not to forget them.
THE ROAD TO UNDERSTANDING
National pride is not ignoble. But the line between pride in valour and gloating triumphalism should be clear. Old soldiers who actually fought on the beaches know where to draw it; their fond memories are invariably tempered by solemnity and sadness, if only for fallen friends. Next year, when the peace of 1945 is marked, the emphasis will rightly shift to reconciliation.
Pride, in any event, should be matched with sober self-knowledge. The place to start is in rigorously frank textbooks at school. Lest they be smug, Britons should tell their children candidly about the ill-treatment of Irish and colonial peoples, just as Americans should pull no punches about Indians and slavery. The next place for conscience-pricking is in an inquisitive press. Best of all are leaders, like President von Weizsacker of Germany, who foster national honesty about historical guilt. If the past is indeed to be a place where they do things differently, it must be recognised that it is not a foreign country.","For nations as for people, denial of the past can be corrupting.

Ozawa speaks for a short time, and 1 speak for a long time."" Thus Tsutomu Hata, Japan's new (and newly weak) prime minister, describing the man who manipulates his coalition, Ichiro Ozawa. Mr Ozawa matters not just because he is the force behind the earthquake in Japanese politics which began last summer; his unJapanese bluntness is also promoting a revolution in thought and debate in Japan. That intellectual upheaval will, in the long run, have a greater impact on Japan than the current political reshuffles.
Mr Ozawa's direct approach is so much at odds with tradition-steeped Japanese politics that it can be counter-productive. His failure to seek consensus this week was responsible for undermining Mr Hata's chances of holding on to power.
Mr Hata's coalition is divided between the Social Democratic Party (former Socialists) on the one hand and Messrs Hata and Ozawa and their allies on the other. Their disagreements, which helped bring down Morihiro Hosokawa, the previous prime minister, have not been resolved. Keen to strengthen his side of the argument, Mr Ozawa has brought together his Japan Renewal Party with three other parties to form a new voting block, which boasts 130 members to the Social Democrats' 70.
In the manner of its execution, this manoeuvre seems to have been deliberately provocative. The name of the new block, Kaishin, literally means ""innovation"", but it harks back to a seventh-century coup in which an anti-reform regent was slashed to death by impatient modernisers. Worse, Kaishin's creation was announced just after the coalition had united to elect Mr Hata prime minister. Neither the Social Democrats nor, by his own account, the prime minister had expected Mr Ozawa to move so suddenly. The Social Democrats walked out of the coalition, leaving it 54 seats short of a lower-house majority. Mr Hata nevertheless formed a government on April 28th. It is unlikely to last long.
Mr Hata may therefore be forced, reluctantly, into a summer election. His image has suffered from the current mess; the main winners from an early vote are likely to be the opposition Liberal Democrats, whose 38-year grip on power was broken nine months ago. New electoral districts, which will weaken them, are due to be drawn up by the autumn. A summer vote, held under the old rules, might return the Liberal Democrats to government.
For the time being, therefore, Mr Ozawa seems to have overdone his bluntness. Kaishin's formation came ""in an extremely appalling way, which would never be accepted in normal society,"" according to a man-in-the-street interviewed by a Japanese newspaper. The Social Democrats pose as the champions of good manners; by stabbing them in the back, Mr Ozawa has infringed on the ideal of loyalty that Japanese traditionally value.
Yet loyalty alone is losing its appeal: younger Japanese want decisions justified by reasoned argument. Bookshops are filled with best-sellers arguing that Japan must become more like the rational West. It is this vast change that Mr Ozawa stands for (and his own pro-reason, pro-individualism, book, ""Blueprint for a New Japan,"" has sold 600,000 copies).
Japan's old mistrust of reason owes much to its history. In Europe, as the middle ages ended, feudal loyalties gave ground to reason, and Luther declared that the individual's interpretation of the Bible mattered more than allegiance to the Roman Catholic church's teachings. The triumph of reason over inherited ideas spurred scientific advance, and led to the industrial revolution. Rational individualism plus growing wealth laid the foundation for democracy.
Japan's revolutions have come in a different order. Feudalism lived on into the 19th century, when a nationalist clique imported the technologies necessary to modernise industry. The import of democracy and reason were postponed, with the result that Japan is now a mature industrial power, but immature politically--just look at the current mess--and intellectually.
SOUNDINGS WITHOUT FURY
The weakness of reason's hold on the country shows itself in many ways. Schools cram pupils with facts; they do not teach the skills of argument. Unscientific views are widely held: for instance, that Japanese snow and Japanese guts are different from the western sort, making the import of skis and beef impossible. Company decisions emerge after exhaustive soundings have established what the majority feels (not thinks), rather than after somebody has analysed the problem (see box). (Box omitted) However misguided the boss may be, his subordinates still believe they owe him loyalty.
This culture is strong among Mr Ozawa's political enemies. The Liberal Democrats used to stick together because young politicians were loyal to their faction chiefs, and this loyalty overrode policy. Indeed, the Liberal Democrats rarely had any ideas at all, which is why bureaucrats ran the country. It is no coincidence that Mr Ozawa is often criticised for his style, but rarely for his policies.
This creates a strange lopsidedness in Japan's political debates: the opposition does not tend to put up opposing arguments. When the previous prime minister abruptly announced a plan for tax reform, the Social Democrats revolted; they quite understood the need for change, they said, but wanted time to mull it over. When Mr Ozawa calls for deregulation, nobody says that he is wrong, but many wish he would be patient. Japan faces a change easily as big as America's NAFTA or health reform. But the antichange side offers no reasoned line of objection, just vague misgivings.
Similarly, there are many who dislike the new, argumentative style that is transforming debate in Japan. However, since the objectors disapprove of disagreement, they have trouble making their case.

The prime minister, Tsutomu Hata, is flirting with anyone he thinks might save him from ignominious defeat at the polls. And a gatecrasher from the provinces is trying to put an end to the whole ridiculous fandango.
The main opposition, the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP), is threatening Mr Hata with a motion of no confidence as soon as the country's budget is passed, which will probably be in mid-June. On the face of it, he is likely to lose: he can count on only 178 votes in the 611-seat lower house of the Diet. But the leaders of the SDP, who refused to join his coalition when they were excluded from a new inner-circle group known as Kaishin, are playing a nice-cop-nasty-cop routine with him, with promises of absolution if he confesses the error of his ways.
The routine began with Wataru Kubo, the party's secretary-general, calling for Mr Hata to go. Mr Kubo knows that Kaishin is a vehicle for the ambitions of Mr Hata's colleague Ichiro Ozawa, rather than the prime minister himself. Mr Kubo hinted that, if Mr Hata were to expiate his guilt-by-association with resignation, the SDP would catch him before he hit the ground. It would join a new coalition, possibly with Mr Hata as its leader, and no election would be necessary. A few days later, however, the SDP seemed to be turning elsewhere. Its chairman. Tomiichi Murayama, suggested his party might be ready to co-operate with the LDP, Or at least with elements within it. Even without an election Mr Hata would be history.
In part this is bluff, in part a real difference of opinion. The SDP is split. Mr Kubo represents the reformers who would deregulate the economy, promote indirect taxes over direct ones, and favour an activist foreign policy. Mr Murayama, a creature of the trade unions, tends towards the status quo.
At present it looks as though Mr Kubo is going to have his way. There will be a price, of course: the end of Kaishin and the humiliation of Mr Ozawa. The down-payment has already been made. Keigo Ouchi, the chairman of the Democratic Socialist Party, was made to announce his resignation on June 1st. Though Kaishin was Mr Ozawa's idea, he persuaded Mr Ouchi to accept the honour of announcing its formation. Now that it has failed to shore up Mr Hata, Mr Ouchi is sacrificing himself as penance.
This is bad news for the LDP. It needs an election sooner rather than later. By September the new system of single-member constituencies promised under the new electoral law is expected to be in place. The current system over-represents the countryside and thus favours the LDP.
The party, though, still has weapons with which to attack the government. It seems content to leave the destruction of Kaishin to the SDP. At present it is trying to undermine the other large coalition member, the Clean Government Party, Komeito.
The cleanliness of any Japanese administration is dubious. Since the second world war, three prime ministers have been forced out of office under a cloud of corruption, and one has been sent to prison. On May 31st questions were even asked about the disappearance from the books of a loan by the hitherto spotless Mr Hata to his wife. Komeito's cleanliness, though, is next to godliness. It is prominently backed by Soka Gakkai, a Buddhist group with 17m members.
Too prominently, says Shizuka Kamei, who believes Komeito's activities contravene the legal separation between temple and state. On May 24th Mr Kamei, an LDP member of the budget committee, played what he claimed was a tape of Daisaku Ikeda, Soka Gakkai's leader, crowing about his influence over the cabinet of the previous prime minister, Morihiro Hosokawa.
All this manoeuvring, though, involves the same old names and faces. Yet the man who perhaps poses the greatest threat to Mr Hata's chances of holding the prime ministership for any length of time is not even in the Diet. He is Takahiro Yokomichi, the governor of Hokkaido. Like Mr Hosokawa (the other new face in Japanese politics, who comes from Kyushu, at the other end of the Japanese archipelago), he is a charismatic outsider. Unlike Mr Hosokawa, he inclines to the left, but like him he has ambitions to reform the political system by breaking up the existing parties. He is promoting the formation of the Council for Democratic Government (CDG), a Kaishin of the moderate left with members from a collection of parliamentary groupuscules including parts of the SDP.
The CDG is expected to proclaim itself officially in mid-June. At the moment it is reckoned to have between 50 and 60 existing Diet members--about as many as Mr Hata's group within Kaishin. This, and Mr Yokomichi's reputation as a popular, honest outsider, could make the governor a man of significance. Come the general election, he will be looking for a seat in the Diet.","After six weeks outside government , Japan 's Social Democratic Party ( SDP ) is bored with being a wallflower .

The third in three months is Tomiichi Murayama, from the left-wing Social Democratic Party. Bizarrely, he is backed by the conservative Liberal Democratic Party(Lop), though not by the reformist party of the previous prime minister, Tsutomu Hata, which would have preferred Toshiki Kaifu, a member of the LDP. The selection was baffling, even to insiders, but the important results are simple. In the short term Japanese politics will be chaotic. In the medium term democracy may gain.
Mr Murayama is 70. He has no ministerial experience. And he comes from the left of the left. From August 1993 until April, the Social Democrats were part of the reformist government led by Morihiro Hosokawa. That coalition collapsed because Mr Hosokawa's sense of urgency clashed with the Social Democrats' foot-dragging. That is one trait they have in common with their new partners in the LDP and the small New Harbinger Party: both take a cautious view of deploying Japanese troops abroad, and both are happy to delay the economic deregulation that most accept is necessary. But the nay coalition is dogged by old memories. During the cold war the LDP firmly took America's side, while the Socialists (as they were then known) preached leftist neutralism.
Memories have already caused some parliamentarians to revolt. In the final round of the ballot for prime minister on June 29th, 51 members of the Diet defied their party leaders by voting against Mr Murayama. They included some big LDP names: Yasuhiro Nakasone, prime minister from 1982 to 1987; Michio Watanabe, a former foreign minister; and Mr Kaifu, prime minister from 1989 to 1881. Among Social Democrats, eight voted against their own boss, and another three abstained.
More revolts may follow as events test the coalition's unity. It may prove impossible, for example, to avoid speeding up the pace of deregulation. This week the yen rose to new heights against the dollar, threatening Japan's fragile economic recovery. Japan's vast trade surplus lies at the root of the yen's strength. Deregulation should help to shrink it by making it easier for foreign firms to sell in the Japanese market. Accordingly, on June 28th, the outgoing government announced a package of 279 promises to unravel rules and red tape.
The LDP and Social Democrats are likely to argue about how to fudge this inheritance. They may also bicker over tax reform, so provoking a clash with the finance ministry, which is anxious to raise consumption taxes. Meanwhile, North Korea's nuclear programme could provoke fresh pressure for economic sanctions. The LDP would want to co-operate with an attempt to impose sanctions; the Social Democrats would not.
The biggest threat to government cohesion, however, lies in the looming election. New constituencies are due to be drawn up by September; many expect an election a couple of months after that. Having fought each other through the cold war, the rank-and-file from both coalition parties are unlikely to co-operate on the hustings. Unless the election is delayed, their interests in keeping the coalition together will fade.
When it comes to the election, however, the benefits of chaos may start to be felt. For the clearest achievement of the political turmoil that began last year has been to break the LDP'S 38-year hold on government. The worry has been that an election might restore the LDP'S dominance, because the new electoral system does away with the multi-member constituencies that helped to protect smaller parties' voices.
As it is, however, the latest defections from the LDP and the Social Democrats have swollen the ranks of the reformist block. This includes Mr Hata and his predecessor, Mr Hosokawa, who belong to a new reformist grouping, Kaishin. Together with the Buddhist Clean Government Party and two other splinter groups, this block is just about big enough to take the LDP on.
The new divide may also offer voters a clearer choice of policies than they have enjoyed for some time. When the LDP was formed in 1955, its character was clear. It was pro-American, and pro-Japanese business. It was against the Socialists, who stood a chance of being elected. But as the Socialist opposition weakened, along with socialism worldwide, the main policy divisions ceased to coincide with party lines. Instead, they fell within the LDP--so depriving voters of a say over them.
Now parties and policies are matching up again. This week's defectors from the LDP, notably Messrs Nakasone and Watanabe, share Kaishin's more outgoing foreign policy; Kaishin's chief strategist, Ichiro Ozawa, believes Japanese troops should take more part in United Nations peacekeeping, despite Japan's pacifist constitution. Meanwhile the Social Democratic defectors come from the right of the party, which shares Kaishin's appetite for deregulation. The next election should give Japanese a chance to choose between this and the LDP'S conservatism.","As they say in Tokyo these days , Japan has become a karaoke democracy : everybody can have a turn at being prime minister .

With a little 3 luck (and much to the relief of journalists who have to remember all their names), Japan's numerous opposition parties are about to follow Thoreau's maxim and merge themselves into something they hope will look as though it could run the country. On September 5th their leaders are due to have a pow-wow to discuss how deep this merger should be: merely a voting alliance in the Diet, or an arrangement that reaches down to the grass roots. And what, if anything, they should believe in.
The merger of the eight parties (only the Communists are not invited), if it comes about, will be the brainchild of Ichiro Ozawa, the eminence rise of the reform movement in Japan. That there are so many opposition groups is largely Mr Ozawa's fault. He has worked assiduously to split open Japan's traditional political parties and winkle out those politicians he believes sympathetic to his causes-economic reform at home and a ""normal"" foreign policy. Now he must show himself a builder as well as a destroyer.
On the face of it, this should be easy. The argument for merger looks unanswerable. Without it, coherent opposition to the government, dominated by the Liberal Democratic Party, is impossible. With it, the opposition might even be able to turn enough coats in the governing coalition to take power without an election. And, if that election comes, unity will be needed to stop the opposition parties destroying each other in the reformed, first-past-the-post, electoral system.
The main obstacle to union may be Mr Ozawa himself. All the opposition parties distrust each other to a certain extent, and there is much jockeying for position in the constituencies over which candidates will stand down in favour of whom. But everybody distrusts Mr Ozawa, even though they support, with varying degrees of conviction, his ideas. Even his own group, the Japan Renewal Party, has reason to be wary. His previous attempt to arrange a reformers' union cost its leader, Tsutomu Hata, his job as prime minister. The attempted merger so incensed the Social Democratic Party that it left in a huff and formed a coalition with the Liberal Democrats.
So Mr Ozawa may find that he has to stoop to conquer. He may leave the incipient party's starring roles to a triumvirate of ex-prime ministers: Mr Hata, his predecessor, Morihiro Hosokawa, and Toshiki Kaifu, who recently fled the Liberal Democrats to form the poetically named High Ideal Party. Mr Ozawa may also have to back-pedal on some of his more radical ideas, such as a permanent seat for Japan on the United Nations Security Council.
Even a united opposition would be around so seats short of a majority in the Diet. But a row within the Liberal Democrats or the Social Democrats (either or both of which is entirely possible) could provoke enough backbenchers to change sides.
At the moment, the Social Democrats look the more vulnerable. On September 3rd, the party--whose leader, Tomiichi Murayama, is currently prime minister--will hold its national convention. This ought to be an occasion for triumph. In fact, it will be more like a decorators' convention, papering over cracks. Though there will almost certainly be a public show of unity, the party is split. Its reformers are unhappy about supporting the Liberal Democrats and its left-wing traditionalists do not want to make policy compromises with the Liberal Democrats. As many as 30 of its 74 representatives in the Diet's lower house look as though they would be prepared to jump ship into a new reformist party if the terms were right. Not quite enough to break the government, perhaps, but enough to make it think.","Simplify, simplify."" With a little 3 luck (and much to the relief of journalists who have to remember all their names), Japan's numerous opposition parties are about to follow Thoreau's maxim and merge themselves into something they hope will look as though it could run the country. On September 5th their leaders are due to have a pow-wow to discuss how deep this merger should be: merely a voting alliance in the Diet, or an arrangement that reaches down to the grass roots. And what, if anything, they should believe in.

1994-10-01,https://www-proquest-com.proxy.uchicago.edu/abicomplete/docview/224113600/fulltext/9F55825E3F9F4F22PQ/21?accountid=14657,"WHEN Japan held its first parliamentary election in 1890, Kazuo Hatoyama was among the candidates elected. Armed with a doctorate in law from an American university, he laid down the rules for Japan's new democracy; he became speaker of the lower house, and wrote the standard manual on its procedure. Later Hatoyama's son fought to entrench Japanese democracy as well, and became prime minister in the 1950s. But the elder Hatoyama's pluralist ideals have had to wait until now, the era of his great-grandsons, to begin to be realised.
Recently Kunio Hatoyama held a party in the family home, a mansion built (fittingly) in the western style during the 1920s. Half Japan's political world was there--the half that is in opposition. For the great-grandson is part of a great scheme, to unite a dozen or so splinter groups into a single party. This would give Japan a challenger to the formidable Liberal Democratic Party (LDP), which dominates the current coalition government. It might just create the kind of stable two-party democracy that the elder Hatoyama wanted.
This would make quite a change. Until the second world war, parliamentary democracy was undermined by Japan's constitution, which laid down that the cabinet would stand above the Diet (as the parliament is known) and could ignore it on most issues. Since the war the LDP has held power almost continuously. Then, in July 1993, its fall prompted a period of flux: in the past year there have been three prime ministers, each wobbling atop squabbling multi-party coalitions. A middle way, with strong governments changing every decade or so, has so far proved elusive.
As a result, Japan's democracy has suffered. Continuous rule by a big party and chaotic rule by many small ones share one characteristic: they deprive the electorate of the chance to choose between clear sets of policies. In the absence of a policy choice, voters are swayed by white envelopes full of money. Politicians, in turn, become captive to the lobbies that supply the cash that buys the votes.
Electoral corruption has a further consequence: it lowers the standing of politicians, with the result that real power is wielded by bureaucrats. Japan's prime ministers can seldom claim a popular mandate for change, so they float passively upon the stream of briefs that gushes from the ministries. Indeed, the politicians are beholden to the bureaucrats, who grant the favours that keep the dirty money coming.
In short, Japan's political system stifles popular participation. It favours insiders (notably big firms and the well-organised farm lobby) who get government preference, often to the detriment of less-well-connected outsiders (small firms, foreign firms, consumers). Often this has absurd results: Tokyo's international airport has only one runway, because local farmers refuse to give up the paddy fields that block that airport's extension. Finally, Japan's political system makes it bad at changing direction.
For more than a decade Japan's trading partners have urged the country to deregulate the economy and let in more imports; the trade talks with America that came to a head this week were the latest chapter in this episode. Most Japanese accept that deregulation is needed, both to assuage foreigners and to boost economic efficiency. But Japan's political confusion prevents a leader from gaining the mandate needed to tackle the vested interests that obstruct market opening.
Equally, many Japanese see that a pacifist constitution adopted in the aftermath of war makes little sense now that Japan has a strong army. But muddled politics frustrates the politicians who might otherwise seek to change this. This lends an awkward tone to Japan's foreign policy. When, on September 27th, Japan formally launched its campaign to sit permanently on the United Nations Security Council, this gesture of confidence was mixed with a meek plea: Japan wants to be excused the nasty work of international peacekeeping.
1955 and all that
A two-party system, with elections that expressed the popular will and so conferred a popular mandate, would go some way to curing this paralysis. But the politicians who gathered at Mr Hatoyama's family home know that more is needed. For, in the 1950s, the same house hosted an earlier effort to overcome Japan's political malaise by forging a new party. And though at first that effort seemed to work, it turned out to compound the problem.
The chief schemer of the time was Ichiro Hatoyama, son of the dynasty's American-educated founder. In 1955 he united Japan's two conservative parties under him, creating the LDP. This prompted two leftist parties to unite later that year, forming the Socialist Party (in 1991 the party changed its official English name to Social Democratic Party). Politics seemed to have divided neatly into two blocks, with clearly distinct visions: a pro-rearmament, pro-business group squared off against pacifists with roots in the trade unions. But the two-party system born in 1955 soon decayed into continuous LDP rule, because it was unsupported by other important measures.
One missing ingredient was electoral reform. Japan's earliest parliamentary elections resembled those of Britain today, with each electoral district choosing a single candidate. But the modernisers of the 19th century were soon alarmed by the emergence of political parties, intent on using parliament's say over the budget to control the supposedly independent cabinet.
So in 1899 a new electoral system was imposed: each constituency would henceforth return several candidates to the Diet, so that a tiny share of the vote would be enough to be elected. This encouraged splinter parties that could not have survived under the first-past-the-post system. Strong, policy-based parties suffered, just as the rulers had intended.
But now, electoral reform has been enacted. A series of corruption scandals shamed politicians into voting four reform bills through the Diet in March; a further bill, laying down the boundaries of the nay electoral districts, is due to be passed in the Diet session starting on September 30th. The prime mover in this has been Ichiro Ozawa, the chief strategist of the opposition groups that met in the Hatoyama home. This is apt: in the 1950s Mr Ozawa's father supported an unsuccessful campaign for electoral reform led by Hatoyama.
The electoral-reform laws replace the multi-member constituencies with a mixture of single-member districts (there will be 300 of these) and proportional representation (which will send another 200 people to the Diet). Only the LDP, which has 200 members in the lower house, can hope to put up a candidate in all 300 single-member districts; the next biggest party, the Social Democrats, has a mere 68 lower-house members. If the LDP's opponents field multiple candidates against the LDP, they are sure to be demolished. So, although they are riven by personality splits, the guests at Mr Hatoyama's house have formed an alliance, even though this falls short of being a proper party. On September 28th they launched a parliamentary group called Renovation, which boasts 187 lower-house members.
The shadow of Meiji
Whereas the old electoral system tended towards splintered politics, weak party leadership, and thus bureaucratic power, Japan's new system tends towards the opposite. But electoral reform on its own may not be enough to make Japan's democracy work. It is possible, instead, that the 1955 set-up went sour for lack of other preservatives. If so, Japan's current attempt to entrench democracy may fail as surely as the previous one did.
What, apart from multi-member constituencies, might have doomed the 1955 system? The most popular answer lies in Japan's political culture. The country often seems to avoid vigorous and open argument in order to preserve the appearance of consensus. Vague public debate frustrates the process by which politicians might seek and win clear popular mandates. Decisions seem to be made secretively, by people whose power to decide is not advertised in their job descriptions. Japan's cabinet ministers seem to be puppets, manipulated by unseen masters.
One school of thought traces this dissemblance far back into Japan's history. In the seven centuries to 1868, the myth of imperial rule masked the power of shoguns; and Confucian ethics stressed harmony over discussion. Then came the Meiji restoration, which launched Japan on the road to modernity. In other countries such revolutions have been conducted in the name of political ideas: republicanism, democracy, socialism. But in Japan the revolutionaries masked their scheme to westernise Japan by claiming that they wished to ""expel the barbarians"". And, although they were bent on destroying feudal hierarchy, their other slogan was ""honour the emperor"".
The Meiji leaders' traditionalist slogans place them in a different era: in feudal Europe rebels called for the restoration of a bygone age, rather than philosophising about the ideal society of the future. This is no coincidence: until 1868 Japan, too, was feudal. Status derived from land and caste, both of which were inherited; there was little in the way of an educated meritocracy to feed a democratic culture.
From the Meiji restoration Japan started to catch up. New ideas were imported from America and Europe. Realising the importance of education to his pluralist ideals, the elder Hatoyama helped to found Waseda, a school for politicians that is now one of Japan's most prestigious universities. But the Meiji clique was more interested in industrial might than pluralism. As a result, schools taught pupils what to think, not how to think; universities mostly trained people to serve industrialisation as scientists and civil servants. When it came to drafting a constitution, the reformers chose authoritarian Germany as the model.
According to the historical explanation for Japan's weak democracy, then, pluralism has never taken root because of modern Japan's anti-democratic origins. The Americans tried to impose liberalism on Japan after the second world war, but within a decade Japan's anti-democratic tendencies had reasserted themselves.
Even today, the shadow of the Meiji past is visible. Like the Meiji clique before them, today's senior civil servants regard fiscal or foreign policy as technical matters for experts to decide, not as the stuff of democratic discussion. The bureaucrats that head each ministry are called ""vice-ministers"", a term coined in Meiji times to underscore their importance relative to politicians.
Meanwhile, politicians justify corrupt behaviour in terms designed to recall the old Japan: giri ninjo--the loyalty and sympathy that bind faction members to their boss--is presented as a virtue higher than loyalty to policy. Bureaucrats who resist deregulation, even though they know it would serve the interests of Japan, invoke the name of Takamori Saigo--a revealing choice of hero. Saigo helped to instigate the Meiji Restoration's modernising reforms, but later felt obliged to side with fellow samurai from his region who revolted against the loss of feudal privilege. Saigo represents the triumph of loyalty over political ideas. Since its appearance in 1975, a series of books about him has sold 8.4m copies.
Culture, part two
History naturally shapes a country's ideas; but it is extreme to argue that modern Japan is captive to the events of the past century. Germany's past authoritarianism, after all, has given way to exemplary democracy. Yet the historical explanation for Japan's weak pluralism does not stop here. A second school of thought sees its roots in America's post-war occupation policies.
The central charge against America is that, by taking the big post-war decisions itself, it prevented the Japanese from debating how their country should be rebuilt. It was this kind of post-war debate, after all, that launched western Germany on the democratic road; the country's Basic Law, which entrenches freedom and guards against concentrated power, was conceived and written by German jurists. Because this had not been imposed from outside, the country embraced it with a passion.
The Japanese were not allowed to do the same. The Americans occupied Japan from 1945 to 1952, and for these seven years Japanese politicians were their puppets. In 1945 Prince Fumimaro Konoe, a former prime minister (and grandfather of one of today's reformists, Morihiro Hosokawa), tried to revise Japan's constitution in a way Olat would appease America's liberal ideas; he committed suicide after his efforts were rejected.
As to foreign policy, the Americans ensured that Japan would remain only half-sovereign even after the occupation was over. This was achieved partly by means of the new constitution that the Americans drafted. Its ninth article laid down that Japan renounce the use of force abroad; it therefore made Japan dependent on America's armed forces.
In 1951 Japan's dependency was formalised in the two countries' security treaty, which gave America near sovereign rights over its military bases on Japanese territory. The treaty empowered America to veto a third power's military presence in Japan, and even to intervene in Japanese affairs to stem domestic disorder. Again, the Japanese had no say in this. The treaty's contents were secret until after it was signed, making public debate impossible.
In the post-occupation years, Ichiro Hatoyama resented the slight to Japan's sovereignty imposed by the constitution's pacifist clause, and tried to revise it. As with electoral reform, he lacked the parliamentary strength to achieve this. Half a century later Japan has potentially one of the strongest armies in the world, and small bits of it have done non-combatant jobs for UN peacekeeping missions. But the constitution has still not been revised; the military build-up has been made possible by its tortuous reinterpretation.
As with the Meiji legacy, the effects of the American occupation can still be seen. Sophistry over the pacifist clause in Japan's constitution adds to the vagueness of Japan's political discussion. Foreign policy is still affected, too: if war broke out in the Korean peninsula, for example, Japan could not help to control the mess, since the constitution forbids it to use force beyond its own borders. Whereas foreign crises some: times strengthen the leaders of other democratic states, Japan's politicians are nearly always humbled by them.
A quick change?
But, as with the Meiji legacy again, the American occupation's influence does not seem insurmountable. Defence dependency discourages the emergence of strong political leadership, just as the books about Takamori Saigo discourage principle in politics. But strong leadership is not impossible: in the mid 1980s, for example, the succession of fleeting prime ministerships was interrupted by the five-year rule of Yasuhiro Nakasone. Given a sufficiently hard shove, Japan's political culture could change rather quickly.
Japan has already had a taste of this, when last year's election toppled the LDP from government. Television discussions on politics had suddenly been worth watching: for a change, the outcome of the election had been uncertain. The LDP's opponents used the media to woo voters in a manner shocking to the old guard, for whom politics meant deals in backrooms. Very soon, however, the LDP had caught on, wheeling out its younger and more telegenic men to face the television cameras.
The prime minister who emerged from that campaign, Morihiro Hosokawa, enjoyed the closest thing Japan had seen to a popular mandate. His opinion poll ratings rose to around 70%, three times higher than those of his LDP predecessor. He appeared on television to explain his policies to ordinary Japanese, so distancing himself from the old guard whose power had been bought with dirty money. And Mr Hosokawa's popularity yielded a lasting result: he and his allies used it to push electoral reform through parliament.
This achievement guarantees that Japan's old political culture will suffer more knocks. Electoral reform is driving the opposition parties together, making it likely that Japan will have two big political camps, each capable of winning power. This promises more televised debate, and a new chance for a leader to emerge with popular backing. The next election, or perhaps the one after that, may be won by the opposition men who met at Mr Hatoyama's house. If so, yet more change may follow.

 The central charge against America is that , by taking the big post - war decisions itself , it prevented the Japanese from debating how their country should be rebuilt . It was this kind of post - war debate , after all , that launched western Germany on the democratic road ; the country 's Basic Law , which entrenches freedom and guards against concentrated power , was conceived and written by German jurists . Because this had not been imposed from outside , the country embraced it with a passion . 
 The Japanese were not allowed to do the same . The Americans occupied Japan from 1945 to 1952 , and for these seven years Japanese politicians were their puppets . In 1945 Morihito Hosokawa's , tried to revise Japan 's constitution in a way Olat would appease America 's liberal ideas ; Morihito Hosokawa committed suicide after Morihito Hosokawa's efforts were rejected . 
 As to foreign policy , the Americans ensured that Japan would remain only half - sovereign even after the occupation was over . This was achieved partly by means of the new constitution that the Americans drafted . Its ninth article laid down that Japan renounce the use of force abroad ; it therefore made Japan dependent on America 's armed forces . 
 In 1951 Japan 's dependency was formalised in the two countries ' security treaty , which gave America near sovereign rights over its military bases on Japanese territory . The treaty empowered America to veto a third power 's military presence in Japan , and even to intervene in Japanese affairs to stem domestic disorder . Again , the Japanese had no say in this . The treaty 's contents were secret until after it was signed , making public debate impossible . 
 In the post - occupation years , Ichiro Hatoyama resented the slight to Japan 's sovereignty imposed by the constitution 's pacifist clause , and tried to revise it . As with electoral reform , he lacked the parliamentary strength to achieve this . Half a century later Japan has potentially one of the strongest armies in the world , and small bits of it have done non - combatant jobs for UN peacekeeping missions . But the constitution has still not been revised ; the military build - up has been made possible by its tortuous reinterpretation . 
 As with the Meiji legacy , the effects of the American occupation can still be seen . Sophistry over the pacifist clause in Japan 's constitution adds to the vagueness of Japan 's political discussion . Foreign policy is still affected , too : if war broke out in the Korean peninsula , for example , Japan could not help to control the mess , since the constitution forbids it to use force beyond its own borders . Whereas foreign crises some : times strengthen the leaders of other democratic states , Japan 's politicians are nearly always humbled by them . 
 A quick change ? 
 But , as with the Meiji legacy again , the American occupation 's influence does not seem insurmountable . Defence dependency discourages the emergence of strong political leadership , just as the books about Takamori Saigo discourage principle in politics . But strong leadership is not impossible : in the mid 1980s , for example , the succession of fleeting prime ministerships was interrupted by the five - year rule of Yasuhiro Nakasone . Given a sufficiently hard shove , Japan 's political culture could change rather quickly . 
 Japan has already had a taste of this , when last year 's election toppled the LDP from government . Television discussions on politics had suddenly been worth watching : for a change , the outcome of the election had been uncertain . The LDP 's opponents used the media to woo voters in a manner shocking to the old guard , for whom politics meant deals in backrooms . Very soon , however , the LDP had caught on , wheeling out its younger and more telegenic men to face the television cameras . 
 The prime minister who emerged from that campaign , Morihiro Hosokawa , enjoyed the closest thing Japan had seen to a popular mandate . His opinion poll ratings rose to around 70 % , three times higher than those of his LDP predecessor . He appeared on television to explain his policies to ordinary Japanese , so distancing himself from the old guard whose power had been bought with dirty money . And Mr Hosokawa 's popularity yielded a lasting result : he and his allies used it to push electoral reform through parliament . 
 This achievement guarantees that Japan 's old political culture will suffer more knocks . Electoral reform is driving the opposition parties together , making it likely that Japan will have two big political camps , each capable of winning power . This promises more televised debate , and a new chance for a leader to emerge with popular backing . The next election , or perhaps the one after that , may be won by the opposition men who met at Mr Hatoyama 's house . If so , yet more change may follow .

Paul Keating, who replaced Bob Hawke as prime minister in December, is well regarded by only 28% of voters, according to a recent poll. The government is 13 percentage points behind the opposition.
Mr Keating, the country's treasurer (finance minister) during most of Mr Hawke's eight years of office, was the architect of the deregulation of the economy. He was an impressive minister. But most Australians blame him for the present severity of Australia's recession rather than giving him credit for the government's achievements. He once said he could ""throw the switch to vaudeville"" if ever he wanted to win popular appeal, but such bits of song and dance as he has tried since his elevation have fallen flat. At a dinner for George Bush, soon after Mr Keating took over, he tripped over his jokes.
Australians do not anyway want a comedian. They want someone to make Australia feel rich again. His first test as a do-something prime minister will come on February 26th when he will present an economic statement to Parliament. He hopes to stimulate the economy enough to improve his chances in the general election that must be held by mid-1993, but without upsetting the currency market.
The signs are that he will aim for tax incentives for business investments, more industry reforms and perhaps personal tax cuts, but costing no more than A$2 billion ($1.5 billion). For all that they once lauded him, the markets are now more generous than they have been since Labor's early days, fearing Mr Keating will try to spend his way out of trouble.
He will certainly be tempted. Australia's two-year recession is the worst since the second world war, with real GDP tumbling by an estimated 1.4% in 1991. By contrast, output fell only 0.2% in the 1982 recession. The unemployment rate rose to a post-war high of 10.6% in December. Its drop in January, to 10.3%, may signal that e recession has bottomed, but businessmen are gloomy.
The recession has helped to squeeze inflation, to just 1.5%6 in the fourth quarter of 1991, and so has allowed the government to cut short-term interest rates to 7.5%, down from 18.4% in October 1989. But Mr Keating has little room for a big budget stimulus. The federal budget deficit is expected to reach A$6 billion (1.5% of GDP) in the year to June 1992. This may seem modest compared with many other economies, but it would be the first deficit, in five years. Moreover, Mr Keating is constrained by Australia's current-account deficit which continues to loom large (3.7% of GDP last year) despite the deep recession.
What of Mr Hawke, winner of four elections in a row? Mr Keating used to be his closest political friend. But, in his first television interview after becoming prime minister, Mr Keating said that Mr Hawke's consensual leadership style was the ""antithesis of leadership"". Mr Hawke was not pleased. He will get his chance for retribution. On February 20th he resigned from Parliament to become a television talk-show host. Mr Hawke had held his suburban Melbourne seat with a 7% majority. Labor in its present state will be hard put to retain it.
John Hewson, the opposition leader, could never be described as a crowd-puller, but he is performing with confidence. For the first time in a decade, the opposition's stars are in the ascendant. Mr Keating will have to strut his stuff better to win the voters and so justify his party's choice of leader.","Changing Paul Keating's has not so far done much for Australia 's Labor government .

Campaigning has started for the by-election in Wills, in suburban Melbourne, for the seat vacated by Bob Hawke, the former prime minister who has left Parliament to become a television star. On the first day of the campaign the Labor man who hopes to succeed Mr Hawke was filmed running away from a group of reporters. He said no one had told him that a press conference had been arranged.
The opposition Liberal (conservative) candidate fluffed his opening salvo too. He had told his party that the factory he owns, which makes lambswool dusters, was in the Wills constituency. He has now admitted that it is not, and has offered to stand down. However, everyone knows that the real battle for the seat is not between these two reluctant celebrities, but between Labor's new prime minister, Paul Keating, and the opposition leader, John Hewson.
Labor has been deeply unpopular for two years, because of the recession and the distraction of a leadership feud in which Mr Hawke was eventually defeated by Mr Keating. The economy is showing faint signs of recovery, and Mr Keating is finding his stride and lifting Labor's hopes. His economic statement on February 26th, with tax concessions for investors and more spending on public works, has been well received. Many Australians agree with his remarks--made during Queen Elizabeth's visit last month--about Australia's diminishing affection for its links with Britain.
As a result, Labor is doing better in the opinion polls. Back in December Labor was trailing the Liberal-National opposition by 18 points. A poll on March 9th put Labor 10.5 points behind the opposition. Mr Keating's standing has improved to 37% (up from 25%), compared with Mr Hewson's 46% (down from 62%). So does Labor have a chance of holding Wills on May 11th?
Wills, in a working-class area, would normally be a safe Labor seat. The opposition needs an 8% swing to take it. But this is not unheard of in a by-election defended by an unpopular government.
Mr Keating and Mr Hewson are treating it as a life-or-death struggle. In some ways the two rivals resemble each other. Both come from working-class families. Mr Hewson's father was a fitter and turner, Mr Keating's a boilermaker who set up his own small engineering business. The Keating family was Irish Catholic, the Hewsons were strict Baptists. Mr Keating left school at 14, taught himself economics and became treasurer (finance minister) in the Hawke government. Mr Hewson was an economics professor before entering politics.
It is their temperaments that are noticeably different. Mr Keating is a confident and fiery debater. Mr Hewson is dour and a bit shy, but through diligent effort has become a forceful extempore speaker. Mr Keating says Mr Hewson is a traitor to his class; Mr Hewson says Mr Keating is a con-man. One way or another their political battle is fiercer and more evenly matched than any that Australia has seen for years, and it will get fiercer with the approach of the general election, due by mid-1993.
One other personality could enliven the Wills by-election. A popular local footballer, Phil Cleary, may stand as a left-wing independent: If he were to win, which is possible, the result would humiliate both Mr Keating and Mr Hewson.","Politics in Australia can have a certain muddled charm .

Though Mr Milken admits to no responsibility for the thrifts mess, the Treasury will nonetheless get $500m of the total from the ""global settlement"" to help cover the costs of dealing with failed savings and loan associations. It will surely not be long before some smooth-talking lawyer argues that, if the government itself reckons junk bonds caused the thrifts debacle, then lawyers and other professional advisers are less to blame for it.
In recent months the director of the Office of Thrift Supervision (OTS), Timothy Ryan, has argued that lawyers and accountants must bear significant responsibility for the actions of their thrift clients. He is now putting his argument to the test of law. That is one reason why a dribble of civil professional-liability cases against law and accountancy firms is fast turning into a flood. Another is that there is a three-year statute of limitations on government suits in connection with insolvent thrifts; the first big batch of failures occurred in the first quarter of 1989.
The Resolution Trust Corporation (RTC), which has handled the liquidation of the 550 or so thrifts that have failed since the beginning of 1989, reckons it will have filed lawsuits involving around 200 professional-liability claims by the end of this year. Three-fifths of them are against outside professional advisers, and the bulk will be lodged by the end of March.
The agency recovered $109m from 91 out-of-court settlements last year, as well as passing 747 cases to the Justice Department for criminal prosecution. This year the regulators have taken on hundreds of lawyers and are seeking billions of dollars in damages. Their most appetising targets are the big law and accountancy firms, which often prefer to pay up without having to admit guilt, rather than risk having their clients evaporate from under them.
Lawyers were shocked last week when the Office of Thrift Supervision forced one of New York's better-known law firms into just such a choice. Kaye, Scholer, Fierman, Hays & Handler were lawyers to the Lincoln Savings & Loan, the biggest failed thrift to date and once run by Charles Keating, who was convicted of securities fraud last year. The OTS sought $250m in damages from the firm, alleging that its lawyers had repeatedly misled thrift examiners by overstating Lincoln's worth and obstructed regulators trying to shut the thrift down, thereby increasing the final cost to the taxpayer of doing so.
What startled other lawyers too was the way in which the OTS broke new legal ground. It sought to use against thrifts' professional advisers the powers granted it in the 1989 thrift bail-out act to freeze financial assets before a case goes to trial. The OTS applied to the court for an order to freeze the assets of Kaye, Scholer and those of its partners. This increased the pressure on Kaye, Scholer to settle rapidly, as its credit threatened to dry up and its clients to desert. Six days after the suit was filed, the firm agreed to pay $41m over five years and to abide by certain other restrictions.
Some lawyers also fret that the government is using this case (and 25 more that the government is likely to bring this year against other law firms) to redefine the traditional relationship between lawyers and their clients. They claim that the authorities are seeking to emphasise lawyers' duty to the public, when they represent clients before federal agencies such as banking regulators or the Securities and Exchange Commission, at the expense of their obligation to act as advocates.
The question of where the main obligation of lawyers (or accountants) lies is bound to get an airing in a suit that is due to be heard in federal court in Arizona from March 17th. Lincoln's bondholders have charged leading firms in both professions--including Arthur Andersen, Arthur Young (now Ernst & Young) and Touche Ross (now Deloitte & Touche), among the Big Six accountancy firms, as well as Jones, Day, Reavis & Pogue, America's second-largest law firm--with professional negligence and fraud in what promises to be a widely followed case.
The government will get another crack at Lincoln's accountants when its own case comes to trial, probably this autumn. Most of the big accountancy firms have already faced suits in connection with their auditing of thrifts. Coopers & Lybrand agreed out of court last year to pay the government $20m for its role in advising Silverado, a Denver thrift. Under a more recent provisional settlement, Arthur Andersen has agreed to fork out $40m-60m for work that it did at Lincoln.
But accountancy firms have come up against nothing as big as the two suits filed by the RTC at the beginning of March, against KPMG Peat Marwick and Deloitte & Touche in connection with the failures of Hill Financial and Otero Savings respectively. In total, the government is seeking $250m in damages.
Last year Laventhol & Horwath, one of the largest accountancy firms outside the Big Six, went bust, in part because of the cost of the thrift-malpractice suits it faced. Others could follow if they lose big cases. The accountants' trade press is full of articles about sheltering personal assets and the fine print of liability-insurance policies. Many accountants are beginning to lobby for the right to form limited-liability companies in place of their traditional partnerships. The threat of expensive lawsuits does concentrate the mind.","On March 9th America's banking regulators agreed to a $1.3 billion deal with jailed junk-bondster Michael Milken and his former colleagues that will settle scores of lawsuits against them.

It cannot hope actually to become Asian. Thinking Australians, in business as well as in politics and the universities, know their country just does not look or feel or even smell like an Asian country. They also know the neighbours will never regard Australia as one of us"". Their aim instead is to make Australia the odd man in--a truly competitive country that is fully integrated into the economic life of the region. As anybody with a sense of history will recognise  the fact that Australians think themselves part of Asia  even to this limited extent  represents a remarkable change in attitudes. Not so long ago  Asians were looked down upon  with a mixture of pity  fear and contempt  as coolies paid starvation wages to produce shoddy goods to do Australian workers out of a job. Prohibitive tariffs blocked the import of Asian goods. A ""White Australia"" policy shut the door against Asian migrants. Political tub-thumpers whipped up patriotic fervour with gory talk of ""communist hordes"" and the ""yellow peril"". With the benefit of hindsight  it is possible to trace the start of the shift towards Asia to the Labor government of Gough Whitlam in 1972-75  which junked the White Australia policy  made the first big cut in tariffs (reversed by the government of Malcolm Fraser in 1975-83)  recognised China  North Vietnam and North Korea  withdrew troops from Vietnam and aid from Cambodia  and arraigned France in the International Court of justice for its nuclear tests in the Pacific. But the shift has really become decisive  and gathered speed  under the four successive Labor governments that have held power since 1983  under Bob Hawke until December 1991 and under Paul Keating  his Brutus  since then. Although their efforts to open up the economy are impressive  there is still a long way to go. The country continues to pay a stiff price for quarantining itself against Asia for so long. By making businesses slothful  protectionism against Asian competitors has depressed living standards. On the reckoning of Senator Gareth Evans  the foreign minister  Australia has fallen from first place in gross national product per head at the start of this century to 18th place. Its share of global trade has fallen by half since 1953  from 2.6% to around 1.3%. While Australia slumbered  the market economies and the managed-market economies of Asia took off. Excuses about coolie wages producing this economic miracle began to sound hollow when Japanese wages surpassed Australian ones; when the so-called Tigers (Hong Kong  Taiwan  Singapore and South Korea) and then Indonesia  Malaysia and Thailand made its economic growth rates seem puny; when Singapore's Lee Kuan Yew rudely predicted ""You'll become the poor white trash of Asia"". Mr Keating  an intellectual bruiser of the Denis Healey sort  said much the same thing in a different way when he warned in mid-1986 that the country was on course to being a banana republic. GREAT DISTRACTIONS Australians can be forgiven for taking such a long time to wake up to the consequences of their complacency. They may lag in the growth tables but the quality of their lives remains enviably high in an empty  egalitarian country that has as many people as Texas but is more than ten times as big. With magnificent sunshine and beaches like Sydney's Bondi and Perth's Mandurah  it is sometimes a wonder that anybody in Australia can be persuaded to do any work at all. The cities are civilised  with safe and lively downtown areas. Safety nets for the jobless  the mentally ill and other unfortunates remain in relatively good condition. So even today  with unemployment rates in double figures  you do not have to weave your way through beggars or step over homeless people. Few young Australians can be called yobs. Buildings are not habitually smeared with graffiti. Nor are cars casually vandalised. Violent crimes are less uncommon than they used to be  and provide blood-curdling copy for Melbourne's sensationalist tabloid  the Truth  but Australians on visits to the third-world inner cities of the United States quickly realise that theirs is still the lucky country. Along with the good life  historical ties of blood and kinship have also distracted Australia from its Asian economic destiny. Shortly after they ceased to be Britain's gulag  the Australian colonies became Empire loyalists. Boys in Melbourne and Sydney rushed to volunteer to fight in the Crimea. New South Wales sent 750 troops to the botched rescue of General Gordon in Khartoum. Australian soldiers helped subdue the Boers in the Transvaal and the Orange Free State. In the first world war and again in the second  Australia pledged itself to assist Britain to the last man and the last shilling and the last sheep. Quoting an old couplet  Robert Menzies  the country's longest-serving prime minister  was moved to say about the queen: ""I did but see her passing by  And yet I love her till I die"".  When the relative decline of Britain's military power persuaded Australia to turn more towards America  its loyalty to its new ally-cum-protector was hardly less intense. Australian troops served alongside Americans in the two hot wars of the cold-war period: Korea and Vietnam. And each Australian prime minister strove to be even more fulsomely pro-American than the last. Harold Holt  1966-67  pledged Australia to go ""All the Way with LBJ""; John Gorton  1968-71  assured the Americans ""We'll go a-waltzing Matilda with you"". William McMahon  1971-72  promised  still more unequivocally  ""Where you go  we go"". With diminishing fears of communist aggression abroad and communist subversion at home  Australia's governments are less subservient to the United States. George Bush got an earful about America's dumping wheat on world markets during his 66-hour stop in Australia on his Asian tour at the turn of the year. WESTERN VALUES  ASIAN ECONOMICS Whatever happens  even if it fully realises its ambition to be Asia's odd man in  Australia will remain firmly committed to western ideas and values--and so continue to vex some of its ASEAN neighbours (Singapore  Thailand  Malaysia  the Philippines  Brunei and Indonesia). They see it as a patronising  preachy country which just cannot resist patting heads and wagging fingers. Mathathir Moriammed  Malaysia's prime minister  worked himself into a lather in 1990 when the Australian government refused to censor a television series called ""Embassy""  set in a fictional foreign country  which  he said  mocked Malaysia. The Indonesian government was just as marked in 1991 by Australia's protests over the massacre of scores of unarmed demonstrators at Dili in East Timor. What right  Indonesian leaders asked  had Australia  a rich country with no threat to its internal security  to lecture a neighbour as it struggled to create a nation out of the former Dutch and Portuguese East Indies? Singapore  recently declared a chewing-gum-free zone by its disciplinarian government  much resents Australia's criticism of its harassment of the Asian Wall Street journal and other independent-minded newspapers. The strongmen of ASEAN will just have to get used to being scolded for such abuses. Culturally  Australia is set to remain a western country. Although Mr Keating is a robust republican  it may even remain under the notional wing of the queen. Depommification is passe. Young Australians are beginning to take pride in their heritage. Australia's new ambition to be Asia's odd man in comes from the mind  not the heart--it is a hardheaded response to the relentless pressures of economic logic. Asia is already Australia's largest market by far  taking more than half its merchandise exports. Japan by itself buys more Australian goods than the European Community and the United States do together. The ASEAN six buy more than the EC'S 12. The trend seems irreversible--and indeed might accelerate. Asia has a growing appetite for the crops  the meats and the metals Australia produces. In their agricultural trading policies  Europe and the United States are unwilling to accept a level ploughing field. Both anyway have other things on their mind. The EC is absorbed by its efforts to create a real internal market and to come to terms with post-communist Eastern Europe. The United States has signed a bilateral free-trade agreement with Canada that it wants to extend to Mexico. This represents a shift by the United States from its previous commitment to multilateralism  and its previous avoidance of bilateral preferential arrangements  that Senator Evans thinks is ""in its own way almost as significant as the breach of the Berlin Wall"". In short  with its old friends and relatives preoccupied  Australia has no alternative but to do more business with Asia. It has nowhere else to turn. But to prosper as Asia's odd man in  it will have to see that its economy becomes a lot more efficient than it is today. It has made a good start. TACTICAL LOSSES  STRATEGIC GAINS Purpose-built national capitals are always loathed. Australians have the same contempt for the bureaucrats and politicians of Canberra as Brazilians have for their government in Brasilia and Americans for theirs in Washington  DC. In Canberra's case  at least  the derision is ill-deserved. In the past decade  the authorities have got most of the big decisions right. True  they have made lots of tactical mistakes along the way. They intended to clear the ""clotted arteries"" of the financial system when they hurried to relax financial regulation  to license scores of new merchant banks and to admit 16 foreign banks (twice the number recommended in the Campbell report on the Australian financial system) into a sleepy commercial banking system. Instead they set off a bloody battle for market share where  in the words of Senator Peter Walsh  banks lent hundreds of millions ""without any mortgage security  without even asking how much was owed to other institutions  and without checking whether income streams could service borrowing costs."" Reluctant to tighten fiscal policy further  the authorities were guilty of another tactical error when  in the late 1980s  they relied solely on monetary policy to put an end to an inflationary boom. That boom had caused bank credit to careen out of control  property prices to soar and savings rates to plummet  and opened up a large current-account deficit that was financed by borrowing money from foreigners and selling Australian corporate assets to them. Interest rates hovered around 20% in 1988-90 to deepen and lengthen the recession that followed--hence the A$2.3 billion ($1.7 billion) fiscal tonic prescribed for an anaemic economy by Mr Keating. Nevertheless  a centrist Labor government dominated byeconomic rationalists has got the big strategic decisions right. Against most voters' expectations  and in flat contradiction to its own traditions  it has created a far more open economy than the one it inherited in 1983. There is still a long way to go  but  like an evangelist preacher  Australia can now boast: ""We ain't what we oughta be. We ain't what we're gonna to be. But  thank the Lord God Almighty  we ain't what we was."" The isolation of this vast land--what a historian  Geoffrey Blainey  has famously called ""the tyranny of distance""--had created a highly protectionist country. The ocean was Australia's first big trade barrier. Manufactured goods took so long to arrive by ship from Britain  and cost so much to transport  that by the mid-19th century Sydney  Melbourne and Hobart already had thriving import-substitution industries: coach builders  candle makers  foundries  breweries  textile mills and the like. After the Australian colonies federated in 1901  protectionism was entrenched by statute  not just in manufacturing but in banking  transport  telecommunications and just about everything else. Other countries  including the United States and much of continental Europe  were just as protectionist at the time  but Australia  with its small population and rich natural resources  was able to tolerate the costs of this economic inefficiency for much longer. As David Hale  of Kemper Financial Services in Chicago  has explained it in his shrewd analysis of the Australian economy  this protectionist trade policy produced a political culture based on rent seeking. The high tariffs guaranteed easy profits for the protected industries. These profits were then redistributed to the workers through a wage-distribution process that included features of the British system of craft-based unions as well as a centralised wage-arbitration court as ""uniquely Australian as the kangaroo."" As a result  the country developed a two-tier economy. The farmers and the miners provided the export income to pay for imports and to service debt. The protected manufacturing industries and inefficient state-owned service enterprises were used to spread the wealth produced by the export sector over a far larger number of people than were directly employed by the resource-based industries. Business commentators blamed the country's slow productivity growth and high inflation on the militancy of the trade unions. As Mr Hale says  they missed the point. The union leaders could not have pushed wages so high without trade protection. In the absence of tariffs  they would have pushed up unemployment. Protectionism was probably bound to collapse eventually under the weight of its inefficiency. With an increasing population and weaker prices for most commodities  especially agricultural products  a two-tier economy  with a competitive tier subsidising an uncompetitive one  was no longer affordable. But the policy-makers of Canberra--Australia's Sir Humphrey Applebys as well as the politicians--deserve praise for hurrying reform along. The Labor government has floated the dollar and abolished exchange controls. It has converted the Foreign Investment Review Board from a controller into a supporter--even a promoter--of foreign investment. It has allowed  correctly even if too hastily  foreign commercial and merchant banks to participate fully in what used to be a cocooned Australian banking system. Deregulation of the airlines has caused a massive drop in air fares  ending the nonsense whereby Sydneysiders found it cheaper to fly to holiday islands in the South Pacific than to the tropical north of Queensland or the national parks of Western Australia. In deregulating financial  transport and other services  and in privatising and partially privatising public enterprises  Australia's government acts pragmatically. It is not out to sell an ideology or to change Australians into a nation of small shareholding capitalists. The aim instead is greater efficiency  and Australia's reformers have learnt from Britain's pioneering experience that competition  not change in ownership  is the key to that. As they see it  British Petroleum was just as efficient when it was partially owned by the British government as it was once it became fully privatised. In both guises  it was subject to the full rigours of competition and run as a corporate enterprise. British Telecom  in contrast  is a quasi-monopoly that has continued since privatisation to provide poor service by the standards of America  where AT&T (the old Ma Bell)  MCI  Sprint and others compete on long-distance calls and the Baby Bells  the local carriers  are strictly regulated. In trade negotiations  Australians no longer have to talk with forked tongues: to demand free trade for farm products while defending high tariffs on manufactured goods. As will become plain when this survey looks later at manufacturing  Australia is on its way to free trade by the end of this century in all goods except cars and its still woefully uncompetitive textiles  clothing and footwear. NEW SETTLERS AND BETTER SCHOOLS These changes for the better have all been noticed abroad  at least on the business pages. Just as radical changes in immigration and education policies have won less attention. Yet in the long term they may do as much as economic liberalisation to help Australia hold its own in competition against the Asian super-achievers. The slogan ""populate or perish"" is now a quaint memory. So is the warning in 1947 by Arthur Calwell  a long-time leader of the Labor Party  that ""we have 25 years at most to populate this country before the yellow races are down upon us"". The old White Australia immigration policy  with its Ten-Pound Poms  is dead and buried. Australia has also lost its enthusiasm for factory fodder-unskilled migrants who were bused up to the Snowy Mountains hydro-electric scheme or the steelworks of Broken Hill. Nowadays it looks for immigrants with skills that are in short supply  and it prefers them young. Bus drivers and dressmakers are not wanted. Anybody over 40 has lead in his saddlebags. Exception is made only for political refugees and  under the family-reunion provisions  migrants with close relatives in Australia. In a region where the admission policies of most countries  with the outstanding exception of New Zealand  have an explicit or implicit racial bent  Senator Evans can brag that in every year since the late 1970s between a third and a half of Australia's migrants have been from Asia and the Pacific. More than 600 000 people of Asian descent now live in Australia  3.5% of the population  and immigration is expected to help swell it to 7% by 2010. Australia is so proud of its enlightened policies towards Asian newcomers that its immigration minister  Gerry Hand  did not know whether to be amused or offended when he was told recently by Britain's home secretary  Kenneth Baker  that Hong Kong was lucky Britain was taking 50 000 families and ""the colonies (sic) should take a lot more"". An unemployment rate in double figures has put pressure on the govemrnent to reduce the inflow of migrants from the 131 500 admitted in 1989-90 and the 123 500 in 1990-91. But whatever happens Australia will not compromise its ambition to be odd man in by once more discriminating against Asians. Like its old immigration policies  Australia's old education policies also swelled the ranks of an unemployable Lumpenproletariat. Somehow a way had to be found to increase the number of children staying on at school past the age that schooling was compulsory: 15 or 16  depending on the state. Against heavy odds in a country where secondary education is mainly a matter for the individual states  Australia has done it by requiring schoolleavers to wait longer before they qualify for the dole and by awarding grants  based on family income  for children who continue their schooling. At first  the scheme provoked scorn. Critics said the grants would merely provide a better quality Chardonnay for parents who had decided their children would stay on at school anyway. The government was right to ignore the scoffers. The proportion of children who complete 12 years of schooling has doubled  from 35% to 70% and is still rising. Secular schools in some states are starting to demand hard work and decent behaviour from their pupils  just as the Catholic Church's schools  which educate about one-fifth of Australian children  have always done. The high retention rate is likely to continue even when unemployment declines. Except in Tasmania  where it is still the done thing for boys to drop out  teenagers think it is cool to stay on at school. DR HEWSON'S ELIXIR The country will not reverse the broad sweep of its policies if it changes governments in the general election that must be called bv early next year. To be sure  there are differences of emphasis. The opposition Liberal Party  headed by John Hewson  is less liberal on immigration (and susceptible to occasional racist flurries)  less generous on overseas aid and less inclined to kowtow to China. But it is at one with the Labor governments of Messrs Hawke and Keating in aiming to make Australia an open  competitive economy that can prosper as Asia's odd man in. The big differences are over means  not ends. In opposition  the Liberals  who are allied with the National Party (the old Country Party)  had a choice. They could occupy the same middle ground as the Labor Party and count on a bored electorate to vote out a government that had served four consecutive terms in office. Or they could promise to go further and faster than even an intrepid Labor government dared go. Under the leadership of Mr Hewson it was inevitable that the Liberals would choose the bolder course. He entered politics to get things done  not to make a name for himself. Unlike Mr Hawke  but like Mr Keating  a prime minister respected more by the press than the public  Mr Hewson is not a natural politician. When he mixes with the people he often looks as awkward as a corporate treasurer at an office party for the cleaning staff. He has imbibed the economic orthodoxies and certainties of the early Thatcher years and is impatient above all to change Australia's taxes so that they promote savings and investment. The Labor government is also keen to persuade Australians to save more  but the Liberal-National coalition is on its own in prescribing as a remedy a massive shift from direct to indirect taxes. In a policy document  called ""Fightback""  it is committed to introduce a 15% goods and services tax (roughly equivalent to what Europeans call a value-added tax) and to use the money raised to scrap the wholesale-tax system and to cut income taxes. On the basis of some heroic assumptions  Mr Hewson's economic gurus reckon the change will add only 5% or so to retail prices. They also reckon  in a triumph of hope over British experience  that something like a value-added tax will convert a nation of profligate spenders into thrifty savers. Bernie Fraser  the governor of the central bank  is among the sceptics. He fears that such a drastic change in the tax system could prove ill-timed and divisive--and  above all  put at risk Australia's success in tugging its rate of inflation below the OECD average. For this  among other reasons  Mr Hewson hopes  if he becomes prime minister  to put somebody more accommodating into the central bank. He had better prepare himself for a fight. Mr Fraser is famous for speaking his mind--politicians  he says  ""can stuff things up pretty effectively""--and he thinks an independent  or at least quasi-independent  central bank is essential to the country's economic well-being. Mr Fraser won't go: he has  he says  no intention of resigning from his fixed term to appease ""some dickhead minister"". Unless somebody blinks  a confrontation looms. A Hewson government's labour policy could be even more contentious. Australia still has one of the most heavily regulated labour markets in the OECD and its trade unions are infamous for their restrictive practices. ""Put two Japanese workers together and you get the synergy of three  grumbles one frustrated businessman. Put two Australians together and you get a demarcation dispute."" in the maritime and waterfront industries  the militancy of the unions is legendary. When the Soviet Union celebrated the 70th anniversary of the October Revolution in 1987  Sydney wharfies sent a telegram to the dockers of Leningrad that said in part: ""In seven decades of struggle and magnificent achievements  the working people of the Soviet Union  under the banner of Lenin's Party  have built a highly developed socialist society  which guarantees economic security and a full and rewarding life."" What the wharfies call ""a heritage of hatred"" has indeed caused massive problems for Australia's exporters. But it is a mistake to generalise or trivialise from the particular. Bill Kelty  the head of the Australian Council of Trade Unions (AcTu)  believes in a ""pragmatic and adaptive union movement"" and knows businesses need bigger profits to finance more investment to create jobs. In its incomes policy  an antipodean version of the old Swedish model  the Labor government has worked with the rational majority of trade unionists to keep wage increases moderate and to link them more directly to improvements in productivity. Even Labor cabinet members concede that progress is slow. Restrictive practices remain entrenched. Dinkum Australian companies still find it impossible to negotiate the sort of deal for a single union recently concluded by Toyota with the ACTU for a new factory in Victoria. Craft unions still resist government efforts to persuade them to amalgamate into industrial unions. Nonetheless  Mr Hewson's party is taking a high risk in promising to do as much as is constitutionally proper to weaken the legal rights and industrial muscle of the unions. It is  for instance  committed to abolishing the tax-exempt status of the unions  ending the practice of deducting union dues from the salaries of employees in the public sector and promoting ""voluntary unionism"". Prolonged labour disruption is only too likely if anything like this happens. Work practices in ships and on docks certainly need changing  but a government that bashes all trade unionists for the sins of a few will invite a backlash. The same combination of mateyness and combativeness that makes Australians the world's best rugby players  and so reluctant to salute their military superiors  also makes them hard for politicians to push around. Those in Mr Hewson's Liberal Party who would prefer a slower  surer pace of tax and labour reform point across the Tasman  where New Zealand has little but economic stagnation to show for six years of radical restructuring. Jim Bolger  the prime minister of New Zealand's National Party government  is getting the blame-rather unfairly since a Labour government initiated the restructuring. He is about as popular as a pork pie in a mosque. MANUFACTURERS' LAMENT In seeking to return their country to full employment  Australians of the left  right and centre put their faith in a revitalised manufacturing industry to create lots more jobs. Their faith is illfounded  and not just because employment in manufacturing is in decline in most OECD countries. Manufacturing companies will bear the brunt of greater foreign competition  particularly from Asian rivals  as trade barriers decline. Fortunately  unless the industrial world moves emphatically towards managed trade  this is unlikely to cause either the Labor government or the Opposition to have second thoughts about the merits of open markets. If anything  the Liberal-National parties  traditionally kneejerk protectionists  seem even more determined than the Labor government to see that no Asian neighbour can ever again justly complain  as did Singapore's Lee Kuan Yew a decade ago  that Australia is ""more restrictive  conservative and backward-looking (in its industrial protection policies) than the meanest of the EC countries."" Free traders have won the debate among policy makers  and among the intellectual elites in the universities  the think-tanks and the newspapers. Though opinion polls show most Australians still hanker for protectionism  lobbyists for hardpressed manufacturers  like the Metals Trade industry Association  find it hard to get a hearing when they bellow for a halt to tariff cuts lest the country end up an industrial wasteland. Ross Garnaut  who advised Mr Hawke on trade policy  may have over-egged the pudding when he claimed  in an article published in international Economic Insights  an influential American economics joumal  that international trade and payments in Australia are set by the mid-1990s to be less fettered by government intervention than in any other OECD country today. But the progress the country has made since Mr Lee's outburst cannot be gainsayed. In line with its policy to make Australia ""an outward-looking community  enmeshed with the dynamism of the Asia Pacific Region""  the labor government is committed to cutting the average tariff for most imports to 5% by 2000  compared with 20% when Labor won power in 1983. The exceptions are cars  where the tariff has already come down from 100% to 35%  and is due to be cut to 25% by 1996 and to 15% by 2000  and textiles  clothing and footwear  where the tariff is due to be cut from 40% this year to 25% by 2000. Mr Hewson promises to reduce tariffs further  faster. Many Australian businesses will not survive the necessary restructuring. The country's manufacturing base is too broad and too shallow as a direct consequence of border protection. For instance  Australia  with fewer people than either California or New York  has five car makers: General Motors  Ford  Toyota  Nissan and Mitsubishi. With such small body-runs  it is simply not possible for that many manufacturers to prosper if tariffs decline to 25%  let alone 15%. Nissan Australia  which lost A$125m in 1990-91  has already seen the writing on the tariff wall. It has given notice it will cease local production in October  walking away from much of the A$1 billion it has invested since 1987. Cars are an extreme case in point  but the same challenge is facing most manufacturers. Many of them  especially those in labour-intensive industries  will go down the gurgler. The best the country can hope for is to be left with a narrower  deeper manufacturing base that has made itself fit not just to survive but to thrive in open competition against Asia's super-achievers. The fundamental change this will require in Australia's business culture was apparent at the most recent of the seminars for institutional investors held in New York each year by McIntosh Hamson Hoare Govett  an Australian brokerage house. Speaker after speaker assured the moneymen that Australian companies had learnt a hard lesson from the excesses of the 1980s--that they no longer deserved to be caricatured as poorly managed and over-geared  with bushranger ethics. From conversations overcoffee and cocktails  it was clear that the audience remained sceptical  and understandably so. Good business sense and good business ethics were in short supply everywhere in the 1980s; but Australia took the biscuit. Even now it is hard to credit how investors and bankers threw such enormous sums of money at such implausible optimists. RUE THE DAY Most visible are the excesses of the property speculators. They have filled downtown Sydney  Melbourne and Perth with see-through office blocks that were supposed to be occupied by financial institutions and corporate head offices. Financed by other people's money  Western Australia's Alan Bond  a beefy property speculator turned entrepreneur  was for a while the world's most famous billionaire. He owned his country's biggest media company and a large multinational brewery  as well as van Gogh's ""Irises"". Many Western Australians reckon Mr Bond could have been elected prime minister of their state after 200 000 people lined the streets of Perth to cheer him when his yacht won the America's Cup for Australia in 1983. Only when his business empire collapsed did the fanciful nature of his dealings became plain for all to see. After examining a complex contract under which Bond Brewing would sell the Sydney Hilton to a Singaporean businessman  an exasperated judge in Victoria's Supreme Court exclaimed: ""In some respects  it has been like dealing simultaneously with a slippery eel and a very large and active octopus."" The backers of other failed businessmen were scarcely less credulous. Christopher Skase's Qintex collapsed owing about A$2 billion after attempting to take over the American film studio then known as MGM/UA Communications. Mr Skase declared personal bankruptcy and left Australia to live in a handsome villa in Majorca. Another supreme optimist  Laurie Connell of Rothwells merchant bank  continued to enjoy the confidence of the state government of Western Australia for a remarkably long time after Perth businessmen nicknamed him ""Last Resort"" Laurie for his willingness to lend money to people everybody else dismissed as uncreditworthy. Warwick Fairfax  then a precocious twentysomething  was able in 1987 to finance an all-too-generous takeover of his family's newspaper empire  whose titles include the Sydney Morning Herald and the Age in Melbourne. The newspapers did not make enough money to service the debt  and Conrad Black's Tourang syndicate was able to pick up the pieces in 1991. Australia's moneymen are not short of excuses for the financial backers of Messrs Bond  Skase  Connell  Fairfax and other failed entrepreneurs. Prudent brokers  they say  lost clients to imprudent competitors. Commercial bankers' salaries  bonuses and promotion prospects were tied to performance. The more they lent  the more they made. Cautious merchant bankers were shoved aside by colleagues who were gung-ho to underwrite junk bonds and to promote aggressive takeovers  highly leveraged buyouts and various creative financing packages. GET RICH SLOW Australia's regulators really do seem better equipped today to curb such nonsense. The Australian Stock Exchange has stiffened its listing requirements and disclosure rules. A federal regulator  the Australian Securities Commission  has replaced the amateurish and fragmented National Companies and Securities Commission  which reported to individual state governments and had a budget one-tenth as large as its successor. Financial prudence seems to be back in favour and the country's best businesses now accept there are no short cuts to prosperity. ""International best practice"" is the buzz phrase of the moment and many companies are engaged in drastic restructuring to reduce their gearing  improve their balance sheet and increase efficiency. Several regret the diversification moves they made in the 1980s and are determined in future to avoid businesses they do not understand. Pioneer international  the world's second-largest producer of concrete  admits it became ""a victim of paranoia"" in the 1980s when it spent money on acquisitions to make itself less attractive to Robert Holmes a Court  a big shareholder it viewed as a potential predator. In deciding to concentrate again on its core businesses  Pioneer has got out of both mining and oil exploration. Foster's Brewing Group has also decided to stick to its knitting. It has already got out of grains and wool and is poised to rid itself of all its remaining agribusinesses as prices improve. In a radical reorganisation  Amatil sold its tobacco interests to become Coca-Cola Amatil--a business centred on snack foods and beverages that is 51% owned by Coca-Cola. Goodman Fielder Wattie  Australia's largest food company  has sold its non-core businesses in getting out of engineering  mining  starch making  canning and fishing. Companies are also slimming their workforces as they concentrate on doing what they do best and seek to improve productivity. The changes are accompanied by  and are contributing to  a shift away from manufacturing to services and from the heavy-industrial heartland of Victoria to Queensland  New South Wales and Western Australia. Along with the few Australian businesses that are true multinationals  like TNT in transport  Foster's in beers and Pacific Dunlop in opportunistic manufacturing  the companies most likely to prosper are those adding value to Australia's mining and agricultural output or serving foreign tourists. As it integrates itself more into the world economy  and into an Asian economy super-competitive in manufacturing  Australia's comparative advantage will lie more than ever in its natural resources and its natural beauty. RED TAPE  GREEN TAPE  BLACK TAPE The mines already sell most of what they produce to Asians but say they could up and sell a lot more if only the bureaucrats  the environmentalists and the Aboriginals would let them. Listen  for instance  to Roderick Kinkead-Weekes  managing director of Hamersley Iron  the country's largest iron-ore producer and a 100%-owned subsidiary of CRA (which is in turn 49%-owned by RTZ). He wistfully recalls how Hamersley  then a company with a couple of tents on a beach  was able to put in a mine  a railway and a port  and to build two towns  Tom Price and Dampier  in Western Australia within a period of 18 months in the mid-1960s. Today  he says  it would take Hamersley 18 months just to get development approval from the authorities. Only if the company was extraordinarily lucky  says Peter Ellery  chief executive of Western Australia's chamber of mines. Many projects in Western Australia  the state that produces about half the country's exports of ore  fuels  gold and other metals  have been subjected to interminable delays. In the three years to the end of 1991  proposals by mining companies involving more than A$2.5 billion in capital investment were put on hold. The chamber quotes chapter and verse to support its complaint  and a stung state government has promised to do what it can to spur decisions. A A$150m rare-earths project proposed by Rhone-Poulenc at Pinjarra was blocked when the company had difficulty gaining environmental approval for the project. A A$1.5 billion coal mine and related power station proposed by Canning Resources at Hill River were initially delayed by government indecision. Part of the coal resources were then quarantined within the boundaries of a national park. Aboriginal-heritage issues blocked a A$350m nickel mine proposed by Dominion Mining at Yakabindie and a A$500m iron-ore development by Hamersley Iron at Marandoo. Lobbying by environmentalists and not-in-my-backyard citizens over road and power supplies deferred the A$135m Beenup mineral-sands project. Similar horror stories are told by miners in other states  but none has gained Australia as much notoriety among investors abroad as the cock-up over Coronation Hill. This is a gold  platinum and palladium mine that Newcrest Mining  a subsidiary of Australia's BHP and America's Newmont Mining  wanted to open on a conservation site next to Kakadu National Park in the Northern Territory. Newcrest's mining lease at Coronation Hill was  in effect  torn up when Mr Hawke's cabinet reversed its policy and decided the mine would impinge on the sacred sites of the Jawoyn Aboriginal tribe. Not only Newcrest was outraged by the ""expropriation of its mining rights"". Bankers warned that foreign investors would  for the first time in Australian history  have to ponder ""sovereign risk"" before investing in the country. MIM  the owner of the Hilton and Mt Isa mines in Queensland  predicted that mining companies would transfer their prospecting efforts to other places where they encountered less bureaucratic red tape  environmental green tape and tribal black tape. The industry's opponents see things differently. Radical Aboriginals assert that white Australia has treated their lives  land  customs and religious rites with as little respect as white America showed the Indians. Environmentalists say that much of Australia is incredibly fragile. They note  for instance  how tracks left by military vehicles during the second world war are still visible in the vast deserts at the centre of the continent. From their viewpoint  the mining companies are not much better than vandals. The century-old gold mine at Kalgoorlie in Western Australia is a notorious example of the damage mines can do to the environment. Even mining executives admit that until Kalgoorlie started to clean itself up four or five years ago  and moved its roasters out of town  ""it looked like Hiroshima after the bomb"". The mine and the miners had denuded the land of trees for miles around and a smelter adjacent to the mine belched all sorts of nasty substances into the lungs of the miners' families  including high concentrates of sulphur dioxide. When miners promise to behave better in the future  the environmentalists simply do not believe them. There is no rational debate  no meeting of minds. The green movement has not entered into the political mainstream as it has in Western Europe and the United States. Cranks are too influential and they join forces with radical Aboriginals to sabotage any and every Outback project. It never occurs to them to ponder why the countries with the poorest economic performances tend to have the worst environmental records. Geoffrey Blainey is not being unfair when he says these dark greens ""think they are living in a canary cage--they imagine that they only have to chirp and the birdseed will arrive."" Some of the Aboriginals are as unreasonable as the dark greens. The mining companies are willing to accept that there is a large number of Aboriginal sites of cultural significance scattered throughout the country. They just want to be told where they are so that their prospectors can avoid them. Nothing doing  say radical Aboriginals. We are not going to divulge the whereabouts of our religious sites. You tell us where you plan to open a mine  then we will tell you whether it is a sacred place. In the interests of all  not just the miners  Australia's rational majority needs to think more about the Outback  and to introduce greater balance into the debate on preservation versus development. Unfortunately  the odds against this happening are high. Australian men like to think of themselves as bushrangers  and to drive about in rugged trucks equipped with roo bars  but they are lost in the wild. Most cannot tell one tree or bird or snake from another  or make a fire outdoors  let alone cook over it. Australians are among the most urbanised (and suburbanised) people on earth: four-fifths of them live in and around coastal cities. with barely 80 000 people  Ballarat  the gold-rush town where lucky prospectors played skittles with bottles of French champagne and lit cigars with five-pound notes  is among the most populous of the inland cities. As Henry Lawson  Australia's favourite poet  once put it: Further out may be the pleasant scenes of which our poets boast But I think the country's rather more inviting round the coast. Anyway  I'll stay at present at a boarding house in town Drinking beer and lemon squashes  taking baths and cooling down. ADDED VALUE A truce with the environmentalists would do much to spur exploration  and to bring more mines on stream faster  but it would remove just one of the obstacles that prevent the mining industry ""adding value""--a phrase intoned like a mantra in Australia. As applied to the mining industry  it means increasing export earnings by moving along the production chain: from  for example  the export of bauxite to the export of alumina to the export of aluminium to the export of pots and pans. If it sounds too simple a solution  it is. Where ""adding value"" can be done at a decent profit  it is already being done. Whatever their other shortcomings  Australia's big mining houses are not myopic. They are capital intensive  well managed and technologically innovative. They also have strong balance sheets. Shaken by an earlier boom-bust cycle  they went into the recession of 1990-91 with a lighter debt load than the manufacturers. High energy prices deter the big mining houses from adding value in Western Australia. Power costs there are 40% higher than in the east. Distance is another deterrent. Western Australia has fewer than 2m people scattered over a state five times the size of France. Perth  its only big city  lacks the manufacturing base of Melbourne and Sydney. Some inland mines in Queensland have even greater geographical handicaps. The high cost of transport is another deterrent to adding value  but at least the government could do something about this  if only it would summon up the political will. Most of Australia's unions are led by economic rationalists  but the maritime unions are a horrible exception. The manning levels and other restrictive practices they have imposed on ships that ply Australian ports have made intra-coastal shipping prohibitively expensive. It costs five times as much to ship salt from north-western Australia to Fremantle in Western Australia as it costs to ship it to Japan. Even with such nonsensical labour practices  it is hard to be pessimistic about Australian mining. The mining industry provides only 7% of Australia's GNP but over 50% of its merchandise (ie  visible) exports. It has vast  under-exploited resources and is better placed than its big competitors to supply the Asian countries that currently possess the fastest-growing economies on earth. But Australian mining will not realise its full potential so long as such nonsensical practices are allowed to persist. DUMPED UPON Rural Australia's ever-increasing dependence on Asia owes less to decisions taken in Canberra than to decisions taken in Brussels and Washington  DC. Australia's farmers  who export four-fifths of their production  had hoped while expanding their sales to Asia to retain their other markets. The lethal combination of protectionism at home and predatory pricing abroad by the European Community and the United States has forced them into an Asian redoubt. When it comes to beggar-thy-neighbour policies on agriculture  the EC is an even worse offender than America. The high internal support prices and import barriers of its common agricultural policy (CAP) first squeezed Australian farmers out of a British market they had supplied for more than a century. In the 20 years since Britain signed the Treaty of Rome  Australian butter has disappeared from British supermarket shelves and exports of Australian beef have declined from 120 000 tonnes a year to Britain to 5 000 tonnes a year to all 12 countries of the EC. Exports to the United States of Australian beef  as well as of sugar and dairy products  are limited by quotas. After squeezing Australian foods out of the EC  the CAP started squeezing them out of third markets as well. In an effort to reduce a 1m tonne stockpile of beef to manageable proportions  the EC sold boneless beef into the Middle East at $500-600 a tonne  compared with a free-market price of around $3 000 tonne. European wheat was also dumped on world markets at prices subsidised down to levels that guaranteed bankruptcy for any unsubsidised rivals daft enough to try to compete. The Australian government instructed its diplomats to complain to European governments; but it was long loth to do more  lest the EC reconsider the promise it made in 1985 not to extend export subsidies to Australia's markets in north and east Asia. By late 1991  with rural Australia in its worst recession since (by some measures) the Great Depression  the Department of Trade and Foreign Affairs (the two functions were integrated in 1987) decided even that risk was worth running. Embassies were told to send a provocative 12-page booklet entitied: ""Are you paying too much?"" to potential European troublemakers-trade unions  consumer groups  environmental lobbyists and so on. The answer  supported by lots of cute tables and charts  is that European consumers are paying substantially more than they need for food because the CAP does not permit the benefits of low food prices on international markets to flow through into the prices in the shops. A comparison of typical food prices rams home the point (see table on next page). (Table omitted) American agricultural dumping and protectionism are less egregious than the EC's but have angered Australian farmers even more  as President Bush learnt when he stopped in Australia on his way to Asia in January. Rural Australia had taken seriously America's tub-thumping on free trade in the Uruguay round of GATT negotiations and so was shocked to discover the Bush administration could  under America's Export Enhancement Programme  out-subsidise the EC on grains. It was also apparent that the White House was determined to stave off the threat of open markets for America's internationally uncompetitive farmers--its ranchers  sugar growers  dairymen and so on. Coming on top of a world recession and a severe drought  the distortion of prices in the world commodity markets by the United States and the EC caused three-quarters of Australia's 80 000 broadacre farms to lose money in the 1990-91 season. The fast pace of productivity growth these farms have maintained over the past few years is threatened by the erosion of their capital base and their inability to afford new equipment. They are  for instance  replacing grain harvesters at the rate of just once every 100 years. Clumsy mismanagement of the market for apparel wool  where Australia  with up to 150m (mostly merino) sheep  has a 65-70% share of world trade  has made matters worse. In 1988-91 the Australian Wool Corporation bought a massive part of the wool clip in an increasingly desperate attempt to hold a floor price. When  in January 1991  it was forced by the weight of speculation to withdraw from the market  it was left with a stockpile that will take several years to sell. Even so  it is as hard to be a long-term pessimist about Australia's farms as it is about its mines. True  the country lacks the great river systems that opened up the interior of the United States  watered its farms and provided cheap river-transport for its produce to the seaports. Much of Australia's interior is so and it is next to useless. Farms the size of Rhode Island support 6 000 sheep  which walk a day between mouthfuls. Then  after years of drought  there is a flash flood that washes the flock away. No wonder pioneers filled their maps with such dismal names: Mount Hopeless  Lake Disappointment  Mount Desolation. Nonetheless  the pros easily exceed the cons. A small population means cheap land  and Australia is able profitably to practise low-input  low-output agriculture. Its ""clean  green"" produce is environmentally sound: Australian farmers can get away with using far less pesticides  fungicides  herbicides and all those other cides that European and American farmers spray so liberally on their fields. Most Australian farmers are not subsidised by the taxpayers and  with the power of their remaining statutory marketing systems being eroded  they are more exposed to market prices than the mollycoddled farmers of Europe and America. They sometimes grumble about this--like farmers everywhere they would like to capitalise their profits and socialise their losses. But it makes for self-reliant farmers who are fully exposed  and so respond quickly  to changes in prices. Their potential market in Asia looks limitless. Much of the region already lacks enough agricultural land to feed its people  and rapid urbanisation and population growth are reducing the supply of farmland further. Asian diets are also changing in ways that benefit the Australian farmers  with people eating more wheat and more meat. Who knows  they may even begin to drink Australia's wines. These are unrecognisable from the days they were sold as plonk under the Empire wine label in Britain. Today they offer better value than similarly priced Californian and French wines. Like mining  agriculture needs to add value fully to exploit its comparative advantage. Australia could  for instance  increase the value of its hardwood timber several fold by exporting it as furniture. Some value-adding can be done without manufacturing. Beef from range-fed cattle is less sought after in Japan than the marbled beef from cattle finished on feedlots. Sometimes an acre of good wheatland is more productive when a farmer switches from growing low-protein wheat for Egypt to growing higher-priced noodle wheat for Japan. Again like mining  agriculture would benefit from an attack by all governments  state as well as federal  on restrictive labour practices. At super-efficient  bulk-handling grain terminals  redundant dockers continue to get paid overtime as well as regular time to sit about playing gin rummy. The cost of loading a ship with rice at some Australian ports is equal to the total cost of shipping rice from Thailand to Europe. At slaughterhouses workers are paid 50% more for killing and dressing ram lambs than wether (ie  castrated) lambs. In consequence  Australia has priced itself out of a niche market for ram lambs in the Middle East. Unlike the miners  however  the farmers are not natural adversaries of the environmentalists. They too have a vested interest in halting  and where possible reversing  the degradation of the land  and they know they have their work cut out. Over-grazing has ruined much of Australia's best farmland. Salination caused by over-irrigation has turned once-fertile fields barren. Land reform could help improve land management. Many pastoral leascs promote over-grazing by giving the leaseholder the right to graze stock  period. The leases do not permit farmers to clear the land or to diversify into timber or crops or even tourism. The absentee landlords  many of whom live in Britain and America  might become more accommodating if govemment imposed prohibitive stamp duties on unduly restrictive leases. The urgency of labour  land and other reforms is misunderstood by those urbane  urban economists  in Canberra and elsewhere  who like to think agriculture will loom far less large in the future than it has in the past. Rural Australia accounts for only 3-4% of the gross national product; but even when handicapped by an agricultural slump  and by egregious dumping by the United States and the EC  it still produces about a quarter of Australia's merchandise exports. STUNNING VIEW Australians would have to try hard to make a hash of their tourist business. Their country can look forward to a massive surplus in the tourist accounts of its balance of payments as more foreigners discover that Paul Hogan and now Greg Norman  those matey blonds who plug their country's charms in television commercials  are if anything guilty of under-statement. And it says something for Australian patriotism that both Mr Hogan and Mr Norman agreed to do the commercials for nothing. Millions more foreigners would like to come to Australia than can afford to: such successes as ""Crocodile Dundee""  an adventure-comedy film  ""Thorn Birds""  a steamy novel  and ""Neighbours""  a television soap  have caught the popular imagination. But mass tourism on the Majorca and Miami Beach model is just not possible in Australia  even if it was desired. Distances make the country expensive to get to (a flight from New York or London to Sydney takes almost 24 hours) and it is also expensive to travel around. So Australia has to try to attract the sort of affluent visitors who are happy to spend a day exploring the tropical rainforest but want a chilled white wine served with barramundi for dinner  not baked beans cooked over an open fire. Australia is fortunate that the distances are less intimidating for East Asians (Cairns is closer to Japan than Honolulu is) and that incomes in several East Asian countries are rising far faster than in Europe and the United States. Fewer Americans have visited Australia in each of the past three years than in 1988  when 352 300 went there; but the number of visitors from Asia continues to rise in both absolute and proportional terms. Tony Thirlwell  the managing director of the Australian Tourist Commission  predicts that the total number of tourists will rise from under 2.5m in 1991 to 6.5m in 2000 and that  by then  half of the sightseers will come from East Asia. It helps that Qantas  Australia's national carrier  has an outstanding safety record: it has never had an accident that has killed a passenger. Increased competition reinforced by deregulation has forced Qantas to cut air fares drastically on some routes  particularly domestic ones  and it is losing money. But John Ward  its chief executive  swears his airline will not repeat the mistake made by deregulated airlines in the United States and permit lower fares to cause it to lower standards of service to its passengers. Qantas worries more about blocks to growth in tourism beyond its control. Runways and approach paths in the region are not yet as congested as those at New York's Kennedy and La Guardia  or London's Heathrow  but congestion is growing and is especially acute in Tokyo  Sydney  Brisbane  Bangkok and Hong Kong. Australian hotels are among the dearest in the Asia-Pacific Basin. South Africa is another blot on the landscape: Australia's tourist operators worry that South Africa has more exciting wild animals to offer and could lure their visitors away if its achievement of greater political respectability is followed by greater political stability. The worries are overdone. Australia offers outstanding value for money for visitors keen on an outdoors holiday of one sort or another. Those interested in museums  mausoleums and colosseums should go elsewhere: Australia's oldest buildings date back less than 200 years to its days as a depository for Britain's criminals. Hence the rhyme so popular among Australia's earliest settlers: The law locks up the man or woman Who steals the goose from the common  But leaves the greater villain loose Who steals the common from the goose. For Asians  and especially the Japanese  the big attractions are the beaches  the golf courses and  increasingly  the theme parks on Queensland's Gold Coast. They also like to go in groups to see such natural wonders as Ayers Rock  the world's largest monolith  and the nightly commute of fairy penguins at Phillip Island in Victoria. Like Asians  many Americans also reconfirm their national stereotype. They try to see as much of Australia as possible as quickly as possible (""if this is Tuesday  it must be Queensland""). However  among visitors from both America and Europe  though not yet from Asia  there is a new mass phenomenon: eco-tourism. Eco-tourists are interested in native cultures as well as wildlife  and the travel industry is scratching for ways sensitively to exploit their fascination for the religious rites  art and artefacts of the Aboriginals. For wildlife  they need only to point the way into the bush. The national parks are wonderfully unspoilt  and filled with animals that hop instead of walk. At Wilsons Promontory National Park  at the southern-most tip of the continent  across the Bass Strait from Tasmania  the sandy beaches are so clean it is almost a shame to tread on them. On a day's trek along remote paths in the national park  hikers come across more snakes than people. Nature cannot  however  be left to take care of itself. Many animals are on the brink of extinction. Destruction of their habitat and the introduction by European settlers of despoilers and fierce predators (feral cats and dogs as well as foxes  water buffafoes and rabbits) have put great pressure on some of the smaller marsupials. But the country has an abundance of kangaroos--3m by one count in Western Australia alone--and it is not hard to see koalas  wombats  wallabies and crocodiles. Birds are the greatest of Australia's natural wonders. At a park in downtown Sydney  a short stroll from the Opera House  the sharp-sighted can quickly spot some of the world's most spectacular birds: galahs  rosellas  sulphur-crested cockatoos  rainbow lorikeets and superb fairy-wrens. And the birdlife of the outback is rich beyond most birdwatchers' imaginings. DEFEATING THE WOWSERS Much of the world sees Australia through the eyes of its golden oldies: Germaine Greer  John Pilger  Clive James  Robert Hughes  Jill Ker Conway prominent among them. More's the pity. Too many of Australia's older intellectuals and quasi-intellectuals have a chip on their shoulders and those who have made their lives and livelihoods abroad are largely unaware of just how much their country has changed--mostly for the better. Customs officers no longer search travellers' bags for copies of ""Peyton Place"" and ""The Carpetbaggers"". Or for the books of William Burroughs and Henry Miller. Book censorship collapsed after the case brought against Philip Roth's ""Portnoy's Complaint"" ended in a sea of giggles. More than 20 years have passed since beach inspectors at Sydney's Bondi questioned women about the size of their bikini bottoms. The occasional film is still cut  the occasional magazine is still banned  but the prudes and the kill-joys  called wowsers in Australia  have lost most of their clout. Talk about Australian philistinism and a colonial cringe is also outdated. Singers come from Europe to the Sydney Opera House to make a name for themselves. Bookshops are full of the novels of Australian writers. The local universities no longer just assume that the qualifications of British and American universities are better than their own. Even rich graziers  the so-called Pure Wools  do not talk of England as ""home"". Patrick White  the Australian novelist who won the Nobel Prize for Literature and who created those unforgettable Parkers and O'Dowds in ""The Tree of Man""  has not been dead long. Yet he already sounds quaint in his famous description of the Great Australian Emptiness: In which the mind is the least of possessions  in which the rich man is the important man  in which the schoolmaster and the journalist rule what intellectual roost there is  in which beautiful youths and girls stare at life through blind blue eyes  in which human teeth fall like autumn leaves  the buttocks of cars grow hourly glassier  food means steak and cake  muscles prevail  and the march of material ugliness does not raise a quiver from the average nerves. In her wonderfully lucid memoirs  ""The Road from Coorain""  Jill Ker Conway is stuck in the past  as to her credit she grudgingly acknowledges  when she rails against a school curriculum inherited from Britain. The history she was taught was peopled with Picts  Angles  Saxons and Boadicea. Her assigned reading was English poetry  plays  novels and short stories. ""We might have been in Sussex for all the attention we paid to Australian poetry and prose. It did not exist."" Nowadays Australian schoolchildren are made familiar not just with the works of their country's writers but also with the works of great Australian painters like Sir Sidney Nolan  Russell Drysdale and the members of the Heidelburg school. The manners and aspirations of their parents are today overwhelmingly middle class. For better or worse  this has changed forever the feel of the coastal cities where most people live. The swill and spill of beer in grim pubs  where men drank to get drunk before an early-evening closing time  is a fading memory. The crude racism that scarred Australia  and caused the authorities to annul the marriages of Australian soldiers when they took Oriental brides  is fast receding. Recent surveys of Asians and Australians living in close quarters indicate that Australians quite like their Asian neighbours and that most Asian migrants have at least one Australian neighbour they regard as a casual friend. Even the old Australian sport of queer-bashing is losing its popularity. Sydney claims to have the second-or third-largest homosexual population in the world  after San Francisco and New York  and most gays no longer feel they have to try to pass as heterosexuals. Tolerance still has its limits. Lindy Chamberlain  a Seventh-day Adventist  was a victim of bigotry when she was unjustly accused  and convicted  of killing her baby in the sensational Dingo case. Too many people were willing to believe lurid slanders about the religious rites of Seventh-day Adventists in general and the Chamberlains in particular. Australia's famed egalitarianism is also not all it is cracked up to be. Class distinctions are less obvious than in other countries but they certainly exist. It makes a difference whether a person's accent is broad  general or refined Australian. But whatever their remaining faults  today's Australians have largely overcome the colonial cringe that so cramped their parents and grandparents. They do not think Australia's most creative people are in anyway inferior to Britain's or indeed anybody else's. And they are quite right. GETTING ON WITH THE NEIGHBOURS Australia's colonial cringe to Britain used to go along with an equally ill-founded sense of superiority to Asia. This  too  has gone. Australians today envy  and want to emulate  Japan's successes. They want to see their country attain the extraordinary growth rates of Asian economies like Singapore  Taiwan  Malaysia  South Korea and Indonesia. Both the Labor government and the Liberal-National Opposition are keen to integrate the Australian economy into Asia. Their only differences are over how fast to go. They also speak with one voice when they promise to convert it from one of the world's most protected into one of its most open economies. There is a similar consensus on foreign policy. Mr Hewson and his team have to scratch their heads to diink of where they disagree with the Hawke and now the Keating government. On the face of it  goodness and light should prevail. The Asian and Australian economies are more complementary than competitive. It makes sense for Australia to import cheap goods from Asians rather than to manufacture costly goods at home behind tariff walls. Asia has a growing need for Australia's metals and minerals. Korea  Japan and China as well as some ASEAN countries are not self-sufficient in the temperate foods Australia sells. Whatever their political and cultural differences  surely the economic marriage of Australia and the Asian countries must be one made in heaven? Unfortunately not. Asia's super-achievers have never fully believed there is a god called free trade that everybody should bow down to worship. They will not easily be persuaded to dismantle their import barriers to processed minerals and foods  and so allow Australia at last to add value to its mining and farm output. For  truth to tell  Asians are not much more interested in Australia than they are in Canada. Though its GNP is about as large as the combined GNP of the ASEAN Six  as a market of a mere 17m people Australia has far less long-term potential to Asia's exporters than  say  Indonesia's fast-growing market of 180m people. Yet Australia has to persist with its efforts to be Asia's odd man in. It has nowhere else to go. When push came to shove in the Uruguay round of trade talks late last year  Australia was shouldered aside by the EC and the United States. The 14-country Cairns group its trade negotiators had put together to press for fairer markets in agriculture was treated with respect only so long as it served the purposes of a mighty non-member  the United States. When the Bush administration decided the time had come to talk turkey to the Europeans  both the Cairns group and Australia were ignored. Further snubs for Australia are only too likely. The EC is preoccupied by change on its eastern frontiers  troubles in the Balkans  and 1992 and all that. The United States is preoccupied by Japan and by the creation of a North American Free Trade Area. The Bush administration swears NAFTA will create  not divert  trade. Australians are sceptical. Just as the EC has granted increasingly preferential trade arrangements to North African countries  so they expect NAFTA to provide trade breaks for Caribbean and Latin American ones. Whatever the hurt  whatever the odds  Australia needs nonetheless to do all it can to retain its old markets. Turning to face Asia does not mean turning its back on the rest of the world. An Australia made fit to compete in Asia will be able to compete everywhere. If it is ever given a fair go.""",,900,Australia,A29-8965,,False,,0,True

Ohio's Democratic senator, now 71, flew combat missions in the second world war and Korea, and in 1962 became the first American to orbit the earth. Tom Wolfe, who immortalised Mr Glenn in ""The Right Stuff"", described him as ""serious about God, country, home, and hearth."" In three successful Senate bids he has received, on average, 67% of the vote. But his Republican rival, Michael DeWine, has found a slogan that may yet unseat him: ""What on earth has John Glenn done?""
The answer may not be obvious. Mr Glenn has laboured quietly (some would say anonymously) in the Senate on issues like nuclear non-proliferation, government waste and science and technology policy. Important as these issues are, they do not necessarily win votes back home. The problem for Mr Glenn, as one local observer puts it, is that he must remind people why they like him.
Mr DeWine, the state's lieutenant governor, thinks of himself as a man of the people. He spent nine years as a prosecuting lawyer in Greene County, and still campaigns in bowling alleys and old peoples' homes with his wife and baby in tow. In Congress during the 1980s he was an unabashed Reaganite. Now, like many Republicans in tight races up and down the country, he is preaching a gentler kind of conservatism: slightly moderating, for example, his opposition to abortion.
He is not so gentle with Mr Glenn. In a style shocking for Ohio, where campaigns are normally genteel, he has run advertisements ridiculing him for failing to repay a debt of $3.1m incurred during his failed bid for the presidency in 1984. Mr Glenn has snapped back, arguing that because he accepted federal matching funds during his campaign, he is not allowed to dip into his fortune to pay off the debt. But Mr DeWine keeps on, pointing out that Mr Glenn has raised a mere $5.25 this year towards its repayment.
Mr Glenn is also vulnerable because of his former links with Charles Keating, a former saving-and-loan executive who is now in jail. In the mid-1980s, Mr Keating contributed more than $230,000 to Mr Glenn for the formation of a political action committee. A Senate investigation exonerated the senator, but Mr DeWine will not let the matter drop; and Mr Glenn, provoked, has replied in kind. He has attacked Mr DeWine, a former four-term congressman, for writing 31 bad cheques worth $13,000 at the House bank.
Each candidate is selling himself as the harbinger of change. Mr DeWine advocates term limits, the line-item veto, a balanced-budget amendment and the elimination of political action committees. Mr Glenn's proposals are less specific, and the theme somehow packs less punch from someone who has been a senator for 18 years.
Mr DeWine's conservatism will serve him well in the state's southern counties, but it may not fly in the industrial north. The Cleveland area, with a well-oiled machine, is home to 42% of the state's Democrats; in 1986 Mr Glenn won there with 71% of the vote. No pushover liberal, and something of a local saint, he will also fare well in more conservative districts further south. He still leads in the polls by margins ranging from three to 15 points. Mr DeWine's strong challenge, however, may yet engineer a surprise.","It is no easy job to run against John Glenn . Ohio 's Democratic senator , now 71 , flew combat missions in the second world war and Korea , and in 1962 became the first American to orbit the earth . Tom Wolfe , who immortalised Mr Glenn in "" The Right Stuff "" , described him as "" serious about God , country , home , and hearth . "" In three successful Senate bids he has received , on average , 67 % of the vote . But his Republican rival , Michael DeWine , has found a slogan that may yet unseat him : "" What on earth has John Glenn done ? "" 
 The answer may not be obvious . Mr Glenn has laboured quietly ( some would say anonymously ) in the Senate on issues like nuclear non - proliferation , government waste and science and technology policy . Important as these issues are , they do not necessarily win votes back home . The problem for Mr Glenn , as one local observer puts it , is that he must remind people why they like him . 
 Mr DeWine , the state 's lieutenant governor , thinks of himself as a man of the people . He spent nine years as a prosecuting lawyer in Greene County , and still campaigns in bowling alleys and old peoples ' homes with his wife and baby in tow . In Congress during the 1980s he was an unabashed Reaganite . Now , like many Republicans in tight races up and down the country , he is preaching a gentler kind of conservatism : slightly moderating , for example , his opposition to abortion . 
 He is not so gentle with Mr Glenn . In a style shocking for Ohio , where campaigns are normally genteel , he has run advertisements ridiculing him for failing to repay a debt of $ 3.1 m incurred during his failed bid for the presidency in 1984 . Mr Glenn has snapped back , arguing that because he accepted federal matching funds during his campaign , he is not allowed to dip into his fortune to pay off the debt .

Opinion polls put the Liberal-National (conservative) opposition ahead of Labor by 21 percentage points. That lead has now been cut to four points. Speculation in Canberra this week that the government might call a snap general election in December seemed entirely plausible. Those in favour of an election say Labor should take advantage of a rising tide; past experience has shown that Australian governments tend to make up round during election campaigns.
Others counsel caution. The government need not have an election until May. Australia has had a longer and deeper recession than most other rich countries. Unemployment, at 10.8% of the workforce, is near record levels. Mr Keating, who was treasurer (finance minister) for nine years before he became prime minister, is widely held responsible for the prolonged weakness of the economy. Australians may not be ready to forgive him.
The Liberal-National coalition is led by a former economics professor, John Hewson. If elected, the party promises a programme of austerity, including public-spending cuts and a new goods-and-services tax. Mr Hewson is clever, but seemingly inflexible. He has managed to knock the car industry, the welfare lobby, environmentalists and even, in one unguarded comment, those who rent their homes rather than own them.
Mr Keating's controversial statements have been more calculated, and often to better effect. Early this year he won some applause when he questioned Britain's war-time commitment to Australia, and suggested Australia might become a republic. His budget three months ago, with A$1.2 billion ($823m) in new spending, was intended to give a modest boost to the economy without scaring financial markets.
But, unlike his predecessor, Bob Hawke, Mr Keating cannot expect to win an election on the basis of personal popularity. He is often called arrogant. ""This is the recession Australia had to have,"" he once said. The remark is now featured in the opposition's television advertisements.
His approach is to sharpen the differences between the parties, sometimes to the point of caricature. Recently he claimed that a Hewson government would be ""one of the most spiteful, vile governments in the western world."" Voters in last month's election for the state parliament in Victoria seemingly disagreed; their 6% swing from Labor to Liberal-National was enough to bring in a new state government. The new premier, Jeff Kennett, said, predictably, that he found the state's financial affairs to be even worse than he had imagined. In a state budget he put up taxes and abolished holiday bonus payments for civil servants. He claimed that Victoria's former Labor administration had borrowed more than it was entitled to, and that the Keating government had known about it and kept quiet.
The Victoria result must give the early-election enthusiasts pause for thought. So too should recent events in Western Australia. Last month a royal commission investigating corruption in the state criticised two former Labor premiers. Western Australia is still run by Labor. The national government was not implicated in the report, but may suffer just the same. If the Liberal-National Party coalition won Western Australia's six parliamentary seats, it would be well on its way to a majority.
The general election, whenever it comes, looks like being close. Mr Keatings resilience is not in doubt. Mr Hewson claims he would be further ahead had he not taken a tough policy line, but he did not come in to politics, he says, to be popular: ""I actually believe I can win by telling the truth and doing what is right,"" he said recently. If voters did not like his policies they need not vote for him. In Australia, as elsewhere, that is a dangerous line to take.","When Paul Keating became prime minister of Australia last December , Paul Keating and Paul Keating's Labor government were deeply unpopular .

But the asset that may yet keep him as Australia's prime minister is a sense of timing. On February 8th he went off with his two daughters in his mother-in-law's car to the residence of Bill Hayden, Australia's governor-general; he emerged to announce that the country's next general election would take place on March 13th.
That is three months earlier than necessary; given that the country's latest--and inevitably dismal--unemployment figures are due to be released on March 11th, it may also be earlier than is sensible. Certainly, both friend and foe had expected a date at least a fortnight later.
So why the surprise? One reason in what is likely to be a close-run race is to catch John Hewson, the leader of the Liberal-dominated (albeit conservative) opposition, unprepared. The tactic may work. For all that Mr Hewson, 46, is a former economics professor, Mr Keating (who left school at 15) has regularly discomfited him in parliament, especially when debating the economy.
But the bigger reason is that Mr Keating senses a change in the public mood. On the eve of his announcement, Mr Keating's Labor Party lost a state election in Western Australia after a decade in power. The loss--the third in a year by Labor at the state level--was predictable: even by Australian standards there had been too many financial scandals in Western Australia involving its politicians (although not the premier, Carmen Lawrence, installed three years ago to clean up Labor's image). What had not been predicted was the narrowness of the loss. Labor, which had expected to lose by a landslide, suffered a swing against it of only 5%, and the opposition's share of the vote increased by a mere 2%. True, it would take a national swing of just 2.5% to bring down Mr Keating's government in Canberra, but he may well feel the pendulum of opinion is moving his way.
Whether it will move fast enough is another matter. Labor, with four consecutive terms, has been in power for the past ten years. For nine of those years Mr Keating was the government's treasurer (finance minister). As such, he promoted the deregulation and free-market policies which stimulated the economic boom of the late 1980s--and are now blamed for putting 11.3% of workers out of a job and causing Australia's worst recession since the 1930s.
On the face of it, therefore, Mr Keating's chances of leading Labor to an unprecedented fifth term look slim, especially given Australian propensities for political banana skins. Only last week, for example, Mr Keating's colleagues were persuading the heavyweight speaker of parliament, Leo McLeay, to step down while a public inquiry investigates the compensation of A$65,000 ($43,500) he received after injuring his elbow falling from a bicycle provided by the parliamentary gym.
But Mr Keating did not rise from the working-class suburb of Bankstown by being easily discouraged. On February 9th he departed from Labor tradition and blithely cut the ground from under the opposition by promising a cut in corporate-tax rates, from 39% down to 33%, from July and an immediate allowance of 10% on certain equipment and plant investment. He also offered an astute bribe to the middle class, with a A$3,200 annual grant for child care.
The extra cost of all this will be met in part by an increase in the budget deficit for the year ending on June 30th from A$13.4 billion to A$15.9 billion--and by selling another stake in the formerly wholly state-owned Commonwealth Bank. Mr Keating faced bitter resistance from the party faithful in 1990 when he pushed through the sale of 30% of the bank. He now plans to raise a further A$1 billion by selling another 19% stake.
Whether Mr Keating's convenient accountancy convinces the electorate remains to be seen. With inflation running at an annual rate of only 0.3%, the economy may well be poised for recovery. Indeed, the economy is expected to grow by 3% this year, after an unimpressive 1.7% or so last year. Ordinary Australians, however, see only real interest rates of over 10%, high unemployment and a plethora of bankruptcies. Theoretically, therefore, an opposition victory next month is there for the taking.
Yet the opposition coalition of Liberal and National Parties may still let victory slip away. Its record is mixed. In November 1991, for example, Mr Hewson launched Fightback, a policy package that proposed a 15% goods and services tax (value-added tax) to pay for big cuts in personal tax and the abolition of other taxes and charges. At the time, with Labor distracted by Mr Keating's campaign to oust his mentor, Bob Hawke, as party leader (and hence prime minister), Mr Hewson's ideas were well received. But when Mr Keating emerged in December as Labor's new boss, he began to harp on Mr Hewson's plans, calling them a tax on every Australian's consumption. Within a year the opposition's standing in the opinion polls was falling and Mr Hewson was backing away from his proposals: the consumption tax would not apply to food; cuts to welfare benefits would be made less harsh; there would be a new A$2 billion investment allowance for business; and $3 billion would be spent on government projects.
Those changes halted the opposition's slide, but left Australia's voters sceptical of the claims by both sides. The Labor Party is unpopular for the pain it has brought, but has raised enough fears about the opposition to keep it at bay.
Now the four main opinion polls are at odds: two seem to suggest a narrow win for Labor and two for the coalition. All that is certain is a linguistically colourful campaign by Mr Keating against the opposition's assorted ""sleazebags"" and ""brain-damaged, loopy crims"".","As a politician , Paul Keating has many strengths : a sharp intelligence , an excoriating wit and rudeness ( opponents have been called "" scumbags "" and "" perfumed gigolos "" ) , and a streak of ruthlessness .

1993-02-06,https://www-proquest-com.proxy.uchicago.edu/abicomplete/docview/224125261/fulltext/A2E0628A50D644A0PQ/22?accountid=14657,"As a politician, Paul Keating has many strengths: a sharp intelligence, an excoriating wit and rudeness (opponents have been called ""scumbags"" and ""perfumed gigolos""), and a streak of ruthlessness. But the asset that may yet keep him as Australia's prime minister is a sense of timing. On February 8th he went off with his two daughters in his mother-in-law's car to the residence of Bill Hayden, Australia's governor-general; he emerged to announce that the country's next general election would take place on March 13th.
That is three months earlier than necessary; given that the country's latest--and inevitably dismal--unemployment figures are due to be released on March 11th, it may also be earlier than is sensible. Certainly, both friend and foe had expected a date at least a fortnight later.
So why the surprise? One reason in what is likely to be a close-run race is to catch John Hewson, the leader of the Liberal-dominated (albeit conservative) opposition, unprepared. The tactic may work. For all that Mr Hewson, 46, is a former economics professor, Mr Keating (who left school at 15) has regularly discomfited him in parliament, especially when debating the economy.
But the bigger reason is that Mr Keating senses a change in the public mood. On the eve of his announcement, Mr Keating's Labor Party lost a state election in Western Australia after a decade in power. The loss--the third in a year by Labor at the state level--was predictable: even by Australian standards there had been too many financial scandals in Western Australia involving its politicians (although not the premier, Carmen Lawrence, installed three years ago to clean up Labor's image). What had not been predicted was the narrowness of the loss. Labor, which had expected to lose by a landslide, suffered a swing against it of only 5%, and the opposition's share of the vote increased by a mere 2%. True, it would take a national swing of just 2.5% to bring down Mr Keating's government in Canberra, but he may well feel the pendulum of opinion is moving his way.
Whether it will move fast enough is another matter. Labor, with four consecutive terms, has been in power for the past ten years. For nine of those years Mr Keating was the government's treasurer (finance minister). As such, he promoted the deregulation and free-market policies which stimulated the economic boom of the late 1980s--and are now blamed for putting 11.3% of workers out of a job and causing Australia's worst recession since the 1930s.
On the face of it, therefore, Mr Keating's chances of leading Labor to an unprecedented fifth term look slim, especially given Australian propensities for political banana skins. Only last week, for example, Mr Keating's colleagues were persuading the heavyweight speaker of parliament, Leo McLeay, to step down while a public inquiry investigates the compensation of A$65,000 ($43,500) he received after injuring his elbow falling from a bicycle provided by the parliamentary gym.
But Mr Keating did not rise from the working-class suburb of Bankstown by being easily discouraged. On February 9th he departed from Labor tradition and blithely cut the ground from under the opposition by promising a cut in corporate-tax rates, from 39% down to 33%, from July and an immediate allowance of 10% on certain equipment and plant investment. He also offered an astute bribe to the middle class, with a A$3,200 annual grant for child care.
The extra cost of all this will be met in part by an increase in the budget deficit for the year ending on June 30th from A$13.4 billion to A$15.9 billion--and by selling another big stake in the formerly wholly state-owned Commonwealth Bank. Mr Keating faced bitter resistance from the party faithful in 1990 when he pushed through the sale of 30% of the bank. He now plans to raise a further A$1 billion by selling another 19% stake.
Whether Mr Keating's convenient accountancy convinces the electorate remains to be seen. With inflation running at an annual rate of only 0.3%, the economy may well be poised for recovery. Indeed, the economy is expected to grow by 3% this year, after an unimpressive 1.7% or so last year. Ordinary Australians, however, see only real interest rates of over 10%, high unemployment and a plethora of bankruptcies. Theoretically, therefore, an opposition victory next month is there for the taking.
Yet the opposition coalition of Liberal and National Parties may still let victory slip away. Its record is mixed. In November 1991, for example, Mr Hewson launched Fightback, a policy package that proposed a 15% goods and services tax (value-added tax) to pay for big cuts in personal tax and the abolition of other taxes and charges. At the time, with Labor distracted by Mr Keating's campaign to oust his mentor, Bob Hawke, as party leader (and hence prime minister), Mr Hewson's ideas were well received. But when Mr Keating emerged in December as Labor's new boss, he began to harp on Mr Hewson's plans, calling them a tax on every Australian's consumption. Within a year the opposition's standing in the opinion polls was falling and Mr Hewson was backing away from his proposals: the consumption tax would not apply to food; cuts to welfare benefits would be made less harsh; there would be a new A$2 billion investment allowance for business; and $3 billion would be spent on government projects.
Those changes halted the opposition's slide, but left Australia's voters sceptical of the claims by both sides. The Labor Party is unpopular for the pain it has brought, but has raised enough fears about the opposition to keep it at bay.
Now the four main opinion polls are at odds: two seem to suggest a narrow win for Labor and two for the coalition. All that is certain is a linguistically colourful campaign by Mr Keating against the opposition's assorted ""sleazebags"" and ""brain-damaged, loopy crims"".","As a politician , Paul Keating has many strengths : a sharp intelligence , an excoriating wit and rudeness ( opponents have been called "" scumbags "" and "" perfumed gigolos "" ) , and a streak of ruthlessness .

A DIFFERENT DIET
Back in 1986 Mr Keating famously warned Australians that their country risked becoming ""a banana republic"". He drew attention to that risk, both as treasurer (finance minister) in the governments of Bob Hawke--whom he deposed last year--and then as prime minister, to try to instil in Australians the economic disciplines that they so conspicuously lacked. The method was a mix of deregulation, fiscal rectitude and privatisation that was almost Thatcherite, and certainly at odds with Labor's traditions. Amazingly, the party faithful kept the faith. So, too, did the unions: their ""accord"" with the government held wage inflation in check. The voters may not have liked the medicine but they knew it was for Australia's good: since 1983 they have voted Labor into office for four consecutive terms.
Whether they now give Labor a fifth chance is as likely to be decided by campaign insults as by economic judgment--hence Mr Keating's description of Mr Hewson, a former economics professor, as a ""feral abacus"". Hence, too, Mr Keating's decision to tap the rich vein of Australian populism. Last week he pledged to hold a referendum on whether Australia should junk Queen Elizabeth as head of state and celebrate its federal centenary in 2001 as a republic. Meanwhile, he describes Mr Hewson's proposed 15% goods and services tax (GST) as a ""monster"", ignoring the opposition's plan to balance it with cuts in income tax and the abolition of several other taxes.
Such attacks make their mark. Mr Hewson is already limiting the scope of his GST, for example by exempting food; he knows that the introduction of a similar tax in Canada has done nothing for the popularity of Canada's prime minister, Brian Mulroney, who announced his resignation last week. As insult follows insult, the opinion polls give Labor a fighting chance of retaining office, despite a series of defeats in state elections and a national unemployment rate of over 10%. Evidently the ordinary voter finds the choices uninspiring.
The two main parties certainly seem to have a lot in common. Both Labor and the Liberals have a similar analysis of Australia's woes, and broadly the same remedy: the country must become a skilled, productive exporter to a market of 2 billion consumers around the Pacific. Yet Labor may deserve some credit for its apparently bleak stewardship of the economy. Mr Keating, after presiding over ""the recession Australia had to have"", has brought the country to the point where it should soon enjoy one of the highest growth rates in the developed world: inflation is a mere 0.3%; industrial output is over 3% higher than a year ago; and real interest rates are among the lowest in the OECD. The question, made pressing by the burdens of unemployment and foreign debt (most of it is owed by the private sector), is what next?
Mr Keating's answer is a fiscal stimulus and further opening of the economy to market forces. Mr Hewson would do that and more, by deregulating fast at the local level; by abolishing tariffs; and by letting the GST encourage a savings habit and so reduce he foreign debt. Neither programme suggests that Australia's reputation as the lucky country will enable it to avoid hard work and hard choices. In this, the leaders of both parties are departing from the practices of their predecessors. For too long politicians allowed Australians to indulge in make-believe.

The Economist's latest poll of private-sector economists suggested an average GDP forecast of 2.7% for 1993 and 3.3% for 1994, which would put Australia near the top of the OECD's growth league. Australia also boasts the lowest inflation rate (0.3%) of the 24 industrial economies.
The bad news is that the politically sensitive unemployment figure, published two days before the election, showed a rebound in the jobless rate in February, to 11.1% of the labour force--not much below last year's record high of 11.4%.
The other black cloud over Australia's economy is its large current-account deficit: 4% of GDP. But this headline figure conceals a strong trade performance in recent years. Australia's merchandise (visible) trade is in surplus; the deficit on its total current account reflects heavy interest payments on foreign debt, most of which has been incurred not by a profligate government but by a private sector that has been reluctant to save enough to finance its investments. Australia's export volume has grown by an annual average of 11% in the past three years, and manufactured exports have jumped by no less than 14% a year--the fastest rate in any OECD economy. Australian exports of manufactures are now bigger than its farm exports--proof, Labor will say, that its policy of deregulation and reducing tariffs has begun to work.
Australia has also been taking advantage of Asia's fast-growing markets. Asia now accounts for two-thirds of Australian exports, compared with just under 50% in 1970 and only one quarter just after the second world war. The share of exports to its traditional European trade partners has shrunk from 23% to 15% over the past two decades.

Coined by traffic engineers, it described what happens when cars become tied up, block by block, bringing an entire city to a halt. William Safire, the New York Times's etymologist-in-residence, wrote: ""Gridlock is to highway engineers what meltdown is to nuclear engineers--a panic inside a nightmare inside a worst case.""
By 1992 the definition still held, only now the panic was political. Washington, it was said, was suffering from gridlock, a paralysis that had rendered government unable to deal with big issues, from the budget deficit to health care. George Bush and Bill Clinton agreed, outspokenly and often. They also agreed, as did an abundance of professors and pundits, that the main cause was ""divided government""--control of the White House and of Congress by different parties. What Messrs Bush and Clinton disagreed about was how to end it.
The voters sorted that out. They made Mr Clinton president, while reaffirming his party's control of the House of Representatives and the Senate. That was no accident. In the 1980s, polls found that most people liked divided government, believing that it curbed the excesses of both parties. By 1992 the voters had changed their minds: gridlock would end if one party ran the show. Even supporters of Ross Perot--who was advocating not one-party but un-party government--agreed. Were they right?
According to the received wisdom in Washington, the answer is yes. There is evidence to back it. Congress is about to pass a budget resolution that will--supposedly--restrain the federal deficit by a cumulative total of $500 billion over five years, along with a $16 billion measure to stimulate the economy. Both are nearly identical with what Mr Clinton first proposed on February 17th. Declaring gridlock over, Mr Clinton calls the performance of Democrats in Congress--led by Tom Foley, the speaker of the House, and George Mitchell, the Senate majority leader-""really astonishing"".
He is barely exaggerating. But the budget battle is far from over. The congressional resolution sets the totals for taxation and spending. The politically painful part-deciding which taxes will be raised and which spending will be cut--comes later. Bob Dole, the Republican leader in the Senate, promises to shoot ""real bullets"" then; and it will be harder to keep Democrats in line. Even if Mr Clinton gets his budget enacted more or less intact, there is reason to doubt that it is a harbinger of a new era of Democratic unity. A combination of forces within Congress, and a lack of consensus in the Democratic Party and among voters on many issues, especially health care, may return Washington to gridlock. Indeed, by the time the 1994 congressional elections come round, passing this budget may be seen as one of Mr Clinton's easier victories.
A MODERN PHENOMENON
If ""unified government"" turns out to be as deadlocked as the divided variety, it will come as no shock to some political scientists. In a recent book, ""Divided We Govern"", David Mayhew, of Yale university, recorded his finding that, from 1947 to 1990, whether or not the same party controlled the executive and the legislature had little effect on the output of laws. ""To suppose that an American party winning Congress and the presidency thereby wins the leeway of a British parliamentary party"", he says, ""is to be deluded by election returns.""
During the Carter years, the last time Democrats were in full charge of both ends of Pennsylvania Avenue, stalemate ruled. Moreover, Mr Mayhew argues, whatever the theoretical benefits of unified government, the divided sort has in fact produced important laws such as the Clean Air Act of 1970 and tax reform in 1986. Even under Mr Bush some worthwhile new legislation--on clean air and civil rights, and on the disabled--did get through.
Divided government is a relatively new phenomenon. In 39 presidential-election years from 1796 to 1952, the party that won the White House also won control of both houses of Congress on 36 occasions; in the nine from 1956 to 1988, that happened only three times. For most of this latter period, Democrats dominated Congress. But many were southern conservatives, often willing to co-operate with Republicans, but not to extend that courtesy to progressive presidents from their own party.
However effective divided government may have been under Dwight Eisenhower and Richard Nixon, during the 12 Reagan-Bush years, the longest stretch of such divided control in American history, it became increasingly less so. The rows between Congress and the White House-over foreign policy, social policy and appointments to the Supreme Court-grew bitter. The most visible symbol of this was the way Mr Bush handed out vetoes on legislation (46 of them, a record) as other presidents do autographed photos.
Some of last year's talk of gridlock was overdone. Congressional scandals--serious (the Keating five, involved in a thrift affair) or trivial (legislators' rubber cheques, and the Capitol Hill bank's failure to bounce them)--had made voters unusually cynical; so had Ross Perot's hectoring. But thins really had got worse. And it was at least reasonable to believe that divided government deserved much of the blame.
Witness the budget deficit. Of the 14 years since the second world war in which America's federal deficit has exceeded 3% of GNP, every one has come during a period of divided government--11 of them in 1982-92. This was not by accident. Federal spending is the prime example of an important issue where progress involves hard choices, and hence where blaming the opposing party is always safer than helping to make these. That is why Mr Clinton's budget is a legitimate first test of the thesis that one-party government will make a real difference.
PROPHETS CONFOUNDED
From the start, old Washington hands took with a pinch of salt the notion that congressional Democrats would rally reflexively round Mr Clinton's economic plan. As the administration floundered in its first days, the pinch became a sackful. Before the plan was unveiled, every White House trial balloon was punctured by some Senate grandee--Pat Moynihan and James Sasser, two powerful Democratic committee chairmen, conspicuous among them. This, said sceptics, was a clear hint of the Democratic dissension to come. They were wrong.
There has been some dissension. But it has come against a backdrop of overwhelming party unity. On March 25th, the Senate approved its version of the budget resolution by a vote of 54 to 45; only two Democrats defected. This success for the White House followed a week in which 56 consecutive Republican amendments had been systematically rejected, among them two that challenged taxes-on energy and on certain social-security benefits-which many Democrats were none too keen on. In the House as well Democrats went obediently along with Mr Clinton.
What prompted such loyalty? Howard Paster, the White House aide who is Mr Clinton's chief congressional lobbyist, says that ""there is a sense among Democrats on the Hill that there is a clear link between the fate of this Democratic president and that Democratic Congress"". That sense is informed by self-interest-ie, fear. Congressional Democrats remember vividly the price their party paid for Mr Carter's perceived failure: in the 1980 elections, 12 Democratic senators fell, and the party lost control of the Senate, while its 119-seat majority in the House was sliced in half.
Should Mr Clinton's presidency meet a similar fate, congressmen think the price could be steeper still. During the late 1970s, says Jody Powell, Mr Carter's press secretary at the time, Democrats saw themselves as the natural majority party. Now they are not so cocky. Last year incumbents were reelected by the lowest margins since the 1960s. Thanks to Mr Perot, the deficit is the issue that many of them think they will be judged on in 1994. Hence their unprecedented eagerness to cut spending.
Even this might not have been enough to ensure such support for Mr Clinton but for a change within the ranks of congressional Democrats. Tom Mann, an academic at the Brookings Institution, points out that the growth of the Republican Party in the South has thinned the ranks of very conservative Democrats. This, in turn, allowed Mr Clinton to ignore Republicans and work out a package-heavy with defence cuts and taxation of the well-off-calculated to win the support of his own party.
TOGETHER, BUT NOT FOREVER
As the budget moves from sweet generalities to sour specifics, Mr Clinton's task will be, in one way, simpler than was President Reagan's tax-cutting tour de force in 1981: he needs no votes from the other side. But there are plenty of wavering Democrats, especially in the Senate, who will be tempted to join Republicans on one issue or another. The list includes such powerful figures as Sam Nunn, the defence guru from Georgia, who may resist proposed cuts in the Pentagon's budget; Jim Exon, from Nebraska, who may do something similar on social-security taxes on the better-off elderly; and Bennett Johnston, of Louisiana, a potential opponent of the energy tax. People on the Hill note that David Boren and John Breaux, two senators said to be unhappy about the short-term stimulus--and about arm-twisting by the White House--are members of the Senate finance committee, where new taxes are cooked up and where Democrats hold a slim 11-9 majority. Their loyalty matters.
No one, least of all in the White House, discounts the risk that the budget package will be picked apart. Any sins of disaffection among Democrats will be pounced on by the lobbies, which have so far lain remarkably low. Public support for the plan has fallen from 62% a month ago to 52% today. And then there is health care. Norman Omstein, of the American Enterprise Institute, argues that, while Mr Reagan concentrated exclusively on his budget, Mr Clinton and Congress may have their focus blurred by Hillary Clinton's proposals. One Democratic congressman generously calls the decision to announce these in May ""the one stupid thing they've done"".
There is truth in all this. Yet somehow optimism seems justified. Mr Paster points out that, historically, Congress has stuck to its commitments, once it has voted for a budget resolution. There may be changes to the plan--more spending or taxing here, less there--but the political pressure will be intense to meet the aggregate targets. Mr Clinton has largely succeeded in painting the lobbies as special pleaders. Public support for his plan may be waning, but the reason is not that voters think they are being taxed too heavily. It is that they doubt the spending cuts will materialise. The slip in support might thus actually improve the chances of real deficit reduction, as a frightened Congress feels the pressure to deliver. ""This year, the sun, the moon and the stars"", says Representative Bob Matsui, ""are all in alignment.""
It is that alignment-of political self-interest on the Hill, a bill whose partisan attractions are powerful, and a loud public demand for fiscal responsibility--that has made it possible for Mr Clinton to reap a reward from the end of divided government. But such alignments are as rare as solar eclipses. Over the next few months, the administration will face a series of issues that demonstrate the limits of one-party government as dramatically as the budget has shown its potential.
One is trade--a matter which, Mr Paster observes drily, ""is less than unifying"". Indeed. The administration's main trade priority, the North American Free-Trade Agreement (NAFTA), is the subject of constant dark muttering among congressional Democrats, who worry that it may cost American jobs. As trade officials begin their supplemental negotiations with Canada and (mainly) Mexico over labour and environmental standards, they admit privately that a huge intra-party row over NAFTA is on the way. Extending fast-track authority for the administration to seek a GATT agreement may prove little easier.
Another such issue is welfare reform. Mr Clinton promises to ""end welfare as we know it"", by imposing a two-year time limit, after which people on the dole would have to work or lose their benefits. Such ""workfare"" requirements are anathema to many congressional liberals, who think of them as ""slavefare"". One top aide involved in welfare reform says the White House will need to rely on an unusual coalition of moderate Democrats and Republicans to get legislation passed.
SELF-INTEREST RULES
Putting together such cross-party alliances will test Mr Clinton's political skills in ways that the budget has not. In the economic plan, he was able to concoct a deft mix of redistribution and deficit-cutting that allows him to appeal to all elements within his party. But free trade and welfare reform are bound to alienate many of his natural allies. Unified government will be little help to him on these and other ""new Democratic"" issues, for on many of them he is well outside his party's mainstream. Being a different kind of Democrat may have helped during the campaign, but it matters not a jot to the old kinds who still populate the Hill.
Even on issues with no ""new Democratic"" slant, Congress is no longer a place where party ties are strong. Mr Reagan's congressional lobbyist, Ken Duberstein, describes the place as ""535 separate fiefdoms"", where a legislator's loyalties are first to his state or district, next to the Senate or House as an institution, and only thereafter-if the current president happens to be of the same party as himself-to the White House.
The reasons for this are many: more precise polling of voters' concerns, increased media coverage, the proliferation of subcommittees. All have encouraged congressmen to think of their power as independent of the president-a perception made more acute by the fact that, with only 43% of the vote, Mr Clinton got less support from their voters than nearly all of them did.
The main force, though, that has weakened party loyalty in Congress, argues Lloyd Cutler, an elder statesman of the Democratic Party, is the way incumbents finance their re-election campaigns. And the response of Congress to public concern on this issue demonstrates the fragility of unified government.
Parties have been displaced as sources of campaign cash by political action committees (PACS) and wealthy donors. As this has happened, the parties--and so the White House--have lost influence over their members in Congress. Whether this result is good or bad is debatable. That the system itself is a scandal is not. Last year the average senator spent some $4m to retain his seat, the average representative almost $600,000. Few challengers had a fraction of such sums to spend, so most of them did not stand a chance. Beyond protecting incumbents, the money-chase means that, rather than debating and deliberating, much time is spent cosying up to PACS and lobbyists with a stake in legislation. This is probably corrupting and certainly distracting. Everyone agrees it should be stopped.
At least, everyone says so. Last year Democrats in the House and Senate passed a reasonably tough campaign-finance reform bill. But they did so knowing that Mr Bush would veto it (as he did). Now, particularly in the House, they are balking at passing precisely the same bill. Here is a test of unified government. The Democratic Congress has the votes to pass a serious campaign finance law. The Democratic White House says it wants one. Yet there is every chance that it will not happen, because the legislators know that such a law would not be in their own self-interest.
And that is an issue where the biggest lobby of them all, the public, is behind the effort. What fate, then, awaits Hillary Clinton's health-care plan? No one doubts that it will be the biggest, most sweeping, controversial and politically explosive issue of her husband's first term in office. Unfortunately, it also presents none of the elements that have allowed him to exploit one-party government to such effect with the budget. There are deep divisions among Democrats about what to do, so the lobbies will have great leverage. Congressional power barons, especially in the Senate, think they know more about the issue than the White House does. And among voters there is nothing like consensus that there even is a problem, let alone how to fix it.
THE REAL DIVIDE
Actually, that is not quite true. Gail Wilensky, the Bush administration's top health-policy adviser, says opinion polls show that the vast majority of voters believe the main sources of the spiralling cost of health care are ""waste, fraud and abuse"", plus ""greed"" among providers and insurance companies. Eliminate these ills, they think, and everything will be all right.
This, of course, is barmy. But it provides clue to something deeper. Warren Rudman, an ex-senator who recently retired in frustration, says similar polls have found that around 70% of voters think that waste, fraud and abuse--plus foreign aid and congressional perks--are responsible for the budget deficit. That is one big reason why politicians have found it so hard to tackle even talk about) the real force behind the deficit, the soaring cost of middle-class entitlement programmes such as Medicare.
At a time when America's political choices will increasingly involve allocating costs rather than benefits, such misperceptions will make it ever more difficult for government to act. The real gridlock, as Mr Rudman says, is not between Democrats and Republicans or the White House and Congress, but between politicians and the people they represent.","In 1980 an 11-day strike of New York's public-transport workers introduced to the American vocabulary an evocative term: gridlock. Coined by traffic engineers, it described what happens when cars become tied up, block by block, bringing an entire city to a halt. William Safire, the New York Times's etymologist-in-residence, wrote: ""Gridlock is to highway engineers what meltdown is to nuclear engineers--a panic inside a nightmare inside a worst case.""

On March 25th, the Senate approved its version of the budget resolution by a vote of 54 to 45; only two Democrats defected. This success for the White House followed a week in which 56 consecutive Republican amendments had been systematically rejected, among them two that challenged taxes-on energy and on certain social-security benefits-which many Democrats were none too keen on. In the House as well Democrats went obediently along with Mr Clinton.
What prompted such loyalty? Howard Paster, the White House aide who is Mr Clinton's chief congressional lobbyist, says that ""there is a sense among Democrats on the Hill that there is a clear link between the fate of this Democratic president and that Democratic Congress"". That sense is informed by self-interest-ie, fear. Congressional Democrats remember vividly the price their party paid for Mr Carter's perceived failure: in the 1980 elections, 12 Democratic senators fell, and the party lost control of the Senate, while its 119-seat majority in the House was sliced in half.
Should Mr Clinton's presidency meet a similar fate, congressmen think the price could be steeper still. During the late 1970s, says Jody Powell, Mr Carter's press secretary at the time, Democrats saw themselves as the natural majority party. Now they are not so cocky. Last year incumbents were reelected by the lowest margins since the 1960s. Thanks to Mr Perot, the deficit is the issue that many of them think they will be judged on in 1994. Hence their unprecedented eagerness to cut spending.
Even this might not have been enough to ensure such support for Mr Clinton but for a change within the ranks of congressional Democrats. Tom Mann, an academic at the Brookings Institution, points out that the growth of the Republican Party in the South has thinned the ranks of very conservative Democrats. This, in turn, allowed Mr Clinton to ignore Republicans and work out a package-heavy with defence cuts and taxation of the well-off-calculated to win the support of his own party.
TOGETHER, BUT NOT FOREVER
As the budget moves from sweet generalities to sour specifics, Mr Clinton's task will be, in one way, simpler than was President Reagan's tax-cutting tour de force in 1981: he needs no votes from the other side. But there are plenty of wavering Democrats, especially in the Senate, who will be tempted to join Republicans on one issue or another. The list includes such powerful figures as Sam Nunn, the defence guru from Georgia, who may resist proposed cuts in the Pentagon's budget; Jim Exon, from Nebraska, who may do something similar on social-security taxes on the better-off elderly; and Bennett Johnston, of Louisiana, a potential opponent of the energy tax. People on the Hill note that David Boren and John Breaux, two senators said to be unhappy about the short-term stimulus--and about arm-twisting by the White House--are members of the Senate finance committee, where new taxes are cooked up and where Democrats hold a slim 11-9 majority. Their loyalty matters.
No one, least of all in the White House, discounts the risk that the budget package will be picked apart. Any sins of disaffection among Democrats will be pounced on by the lobbies, which have so far lain remarkably low. Public support for the plan has fallen from 62% a month ago to 52% today. And then there is health care. Norman Omstein, of the American Enterprise Institute, argues that, while Mr Reagan concentrated exclusively on his budget, Mr Clinton and Congress may have their focus blurred by Hillary Clinton's proposals. One Democratic congressman generously calls the decision to announce these in May ""the one stupid thing they've done"".
There is truth in all this. Yet somehow optimism seems justified. Mr Paster points out that, historically, Congress has stuck to its commitments, once it has voted for a budget resolution. There may be changes to the plan--more spending or taxing here, less there--but the political pressure will be intense to meet the aggregate targets. Mr Clinton has largely succeeded in painting the lobbies as special pleaders. Public support for his plan may be waning, but the reason is not that voters think they are being taxed too heavily. It is that they doubt the spending cuts will materialise. The slip in support might thus actually improve the chances of real deficit reduction, as a frightened Congress feels the pressure to deliver. ""This year, the sun, the moon and the stars"", says Representative Bob Matsui, ""are all in alignment.""
It is that alignment-of political self-interest on the Hill, a bill whose partisan attractions are powerful, and a loud public demand for fiscal responsibility--that has made it possible for Mr Clinton to reap a reward from the end of divided government. But such alignments are as rare as solar eclipses. Over the next few months, the administration will face a series of issues that demonstrate the limits of one-party government as dramatically as the budget has shown its potential.
One is trade--a matter which, Mr Paster observes drily, ""is less than unifying"". Indeed. The administration's main trade priority, the North American Free-Trade Agreement (NAFTA), is the subject of constant dark muttering among congressional Democrats, who worry that it may cost American jobs. As trade officials begin their supplemental negotiations with Canada and (mainly) Mexico over labour and environmental standards, they admit privately that a huge intra-party row over NAFTA is on the way. Extending fast-track authority for the administration to seek a GATT agreement may prove little easier.
Another such issue is welfare reform. Mr Clinton promises to ""end welfare as we know it"", by imposing a two-year time limit, after which people on the dole would have to work or lose their benefits. Such ""workfare"" requirements are anathema to many congressional liberals, who think of them as ""slavefare"". One top aide involved in welfare reform says the White House will need to rely on an unusual coalition of moderate Democrats and Republicans to get legislation passed.
SELF-INTEREST RULES
Putting together such cross-party alliances will test Mr Clinton's political skills in ways that the budget has not. In the economic plan, he was able to concoct a deft mix of redistribution and deficit-cutting that allows him to appeal to all elements within his party. But free trade and welfare reform are bound to alienate many of his natural allies. Unified government will be little help to him on these and other ""new Democratic"" issues, for on many of them he is well outside his party's mainstream. Being a different kind of Democrat may have helped during the campaign, but it matters not a jot to the old kinds who still populate the Hill.
Even on issues with no ""new Democratic"" slant, Congress is no longer a place where party ties are strong. Mr Reagan's congressional lobbyist, Ken Duberstein, describes the place as ""535 separate fiefdoms"", where a legislator's loyalties are first to his state or district, next to the Senate or House as an institution, and only thereafter-if the current president happens to be of the same party as himself-to the White House.
The reasons for this are many: more precise polling of voters' concerns, increased media coverage, the proliferation of subcommittees. All have encouraged congressmen to think of their power as independent of the president-a perception made more acute by the fact that, with only 43% of the vote, Mr Clinton got less support from their voters than nearly all of them did.
The main force, though, that has weakened party loyalty in Congress, argues Lloyd Cutler, an elder statesman of the Democratic Party, is the way incumbents finance their re-election campaigns. And the response of Congress to public concern on this issue demonstrates the fragility of unified government.
Parties have been displaced as sources of campaign cash by political action committees (PACS) and wealthy donors. As this has happened, the parties--and so the White House--have lost influence over their members in Congress. Whether this result is good or bad is debatable. That the system itself is a scandal is not. Last year the average senator spent some $4m to retain his seat, the average representative almost $600,000. Few challengers had a fraction of such sums to spend, so most of them did not stand a chance. Beyond protecting incumbents, the money-chase means that, rather than debating and deliberating, much time is spent cosying up to PACS and lobbyists with a stake in legislation. This is probably corrupting and certainly distracting. Everyone agrees it should be stopped.
At least, everyone says so. Last year Democrats in the House and Senate passed a reasonably tough campaign-finance reform bill. But they did so knowing that Mr Bush would veto it (as he did). Now, particularly in the House, they are balking at passing precisely the same bill. Here is a test of unified government. The Democratic Congress has the votes to pass a serious campaign finance law. The Democratic White House says it wants one. Yet there is every chance that it will not happen, because the legislators know that such a law would not be in their own self-interest.
And that is an issue where the biggest lobby of them all, the public, is behind the effort. What fate, then, awaits Hillary Clinton's health-care plan? No one doubts that it will be the biggest, most sweeping, controversial and politically explosive issue of her husband's first term in office. Unfortunately, it also presents none of the elements that have allowed him to exploit one-party government to such effect with the budget. There are deep divisions among Democrats about what to do, so the lobbies will have great leverage. Congressional power barons, especially in the Senate, think they know more about the issue than the White House does. And among voters there is nothing like consensus that there even is a problem, let alone how to fix it.
THE REAL DIVIDE
Actually, that is not quite true. Gail Wilensky, the Bush administration's top health-policy adviser, says opinion polls show that the vast majority of voters believe the main sources of the spiralling cost of health care are ""waste, fraud and abuse"", plus ""greed"" among providers and insurance companies. Eliminate these ills, they think, and everything will be all right.
This, of course, is barmy. But it provides clue to something deeper. Warren Rudman, an ex-senator who recently retired in frustration, says similar polls have found that around 70% of voters think that waste, fraud and abuse--plus foreign aid and congressional perks--are responsible for the budget deficit. That is one big reason why politicians have found it so hard to tackle even talk about) the real force behind the deficit, the soaring cost of middle-class entitlement programmes such as Medicare.
At a time when America's political choices will increasingly involve allocating costs rather than benefits, such misperceptions will make it ever more difficult for government to act. The real gridlock, as Mr Rudman says, is not between Democrats and Republicans or the White House and Congress, but between politicians and the people they represent.",900,Australia,A29-8965,,False,,0,True

The problem, which has long troubled white consciences, has come to the fore now because of a decision by the High Court that in one case aborigines have a legal claim to lands where they hunted before the white man came. The case, which concerned three small islands in the Torres Strait, came before the court last year. But worries about its outcome have been growing as mining companies and others have woken up to the fact that their lands may be claimed by aborigine groups.
Mr Keating is being urged to act quickly to avoid years of uncertainty while new claims are fought through the courts. On May 22nd, during a visit to New Zealand, he was asked if Australia would follow the example of the Kiwis: in 1840, under the Treaty of Waitangi, Maoris were promised land rights. No such all-embracing promise was ever given to Australia's aborigines, and Mr Keating gave no hint that one would be given now. He spoke vaguely of a new opportunity for reconciliation between aborigines and other Australians.
The assumption that aborigines had no right to the land dates back to 1770 when James Cook--Captain Cook, the explorer of much of the Pacific--claimed Australia on behalf of George III. The doctrine of terra nullius (no man's land) was accepted by the courts until Eddie Mabo brought his case to the High Court last year. The court found that in some ill-defined circumstances aborigines had ""native title"" over some land in the islands where Mr Mabo and his group live. Aborigines elsewhere have now started making claims for land, relying in part on the Mabo judgment.
Past treatment of the aborigines has been shameful, but these days efforts are made to respect their customs and traditional homelands. An act of 1975 forbids discrimination against anyone on the ground of race. But for aborigine campaigners gestures have not been enough. The Mabo judgment gives them clout.
Lawyers seeking to interpret the judgment believe that land held under freehold title cannot be claimed by aborigines, but that vacant Crown land can be. The judgment leaves a large grey area and much scope for argument. Most land likely to be in dispute lies in remote areas of Western Australia, the Northern Territory and Queensland.
If the courts were to try to settle each claim on a case-by-case basis, it could take for ever. Most people therefore accept that the government has to do something. Mr Keating is expected to put the government's proposals to a meeting of state premiers on June 8th. It is likely that he will set out to make a deal with the aborigines, offering compensation in return for legislation that clarifies their rights over land.

Other Australian farmers may be less adept at publicising their troubles, but are no less desperate. After three seasons of drought, the average farmer is likely, according to the Australian Bureau of Agricultural and Resource Economics, to make a loss of A$25,700 this financial year, only slightly less than last year's average loss of A$29,100. Drought has always been a hazard of life in the bush. Now farmers are also being hit by rising costs and falling prices for agricultural exports. The fall has assumed a long-term trend.
""Get big or get out,"" used to be sound advice for Australian farmers. But farmers who borrowed heavily to get big were hit when interest rates were raised to record levels by a government trying to cope with an economic crisis. Many farmers went bust.
Because of failing farms and the shedding of labour, many people have left the land and moved to the cities, putting paid to the back-to-the-land schemes encouraged by successive governments.

Even before the drift from the land, Australia was one of the most urbanised countries in the world.

Away from the big cities, the only places where the population is growing are in smaller towns on the coast. Small towns near the big cities have commuter populations.

But most of the phosphate has been mined. What is left is an investment trust with assets valued at $1 billion.
That is hardly bird-droppings. But some islanders believe a lot of money has been frittered away. The latest disappointment was a short-lived London musical, ""Leonardo"", written by a foreign adviser who persuaded the government to put $2m into it.
That flop upset Ruby Dediyo, a former member of the island's parliament, and 20 housewife followers. So did a letter of resignation written by an Australian, Geoffrey Chatfield, after only eight weeks as secretary of the Nauru Phosphate Royalties Trust. Mr Chatfield was reported to have said he was going to avoid being made a scapegoat for money problems at the trust. To the embarrassment of Nauru's President Bernard Dowiyogo, Miss Dediyo and her followers, flourishing a placard asking ""Where has all the money gone?"", staged a demonstration outside the civic centre during the meeting on August 10th and 11th of the South Pacific Forum, a group of 13 Pacific island-states plus Australia and New Zealand.
The forum spent much of its two days fretting about money, and notably the fact that while its members absorb far more aid per person than most other countries, growth for nearly all 13 has been almost nil for years. Meanwhile, populations on small, near-resourceless islands are swelling by 4% a year. Could the Americans help? The island leaders hoped so, said Sitiveni Rabuka, prime minister of Fiji. The islanders will all be in Washington in October to meet State Department officials, and perhaps even President Clinton.
Three other worries surfaced at Nauru. Australia's Paul Keating snarled against ""unprincipled and exploitive"" ravaging of Melanesia's rainforests by (mainly Asian) loggers. The forum's Fisheries Agency complained that Japan was sabotaging its efforts to stop exploitation of the hue South Pacific tuna stock by foreign fishing fleets. And in its communique the forum wailed that something must be done to stop its members being diddled by ""crooks and carpetbaggers"".
There was some comfort for Nauru itself. During the forum Mr Dowiyogo picked up an A $107m ($72m) final pay-off from Australia to settle the island's claim for compensation for the ruining of about two-thirds of its territory by the British Phosphate Commission. Australia wants Britain and New Zealand, which shared ownership of the commission with it, to share the bill too.
At which point these storms in a Pacific teacup became rather more than that. A global precedent, to be precise.

Labor has now been in power for ten years and, like the Tories, is looking tired. It is low in the opinion polls and, of all things, has bungled its budget, which should have been a showpiece for the government.
The budget problem has its roots in promises made by the prime minister, Paul Keating, during the March election campaign. He said that Labor would match the opposition's plans to cut income tax, but without introducing a new goods and services tax. Come budget day, August 17th, the treasurer (finance minister), John Dawkins had the thankless task of showing that the arithmetic did not balance.
Half of Mr Keating's promised tax cuts were to be delayed for several years. To pay for the other half, due in November, several indirect taxes had to be increased--technically sticking to Mr Keating's pledge that there would be no new taxes, but no more popular for that. An opinion poll said that more than 70% of those interviewed believed that the proposed budget would leave them worse off.
Few people had a good word for the budget. Traditional Labor supporters were upset that it would hit the poor, by increasing indirect taxes. Even so, the government probably could have got it through the lower house of Parliament. But it does not have a majority in the upper house, the Senate, charmingly described last year by Mr Keating as ""unrepresentative swill"". Two small parties hold the balance of power there, the leftish Australian Democrats with seven senators, and two Greens.
The Democrats have been a declining force for a decade, but under their new leader, Cheryl Kernot, a school teacher, they became the heroes of the hour, insisting on changes to the objectionable new taxes. At midnight on August 30th, after a day and night of meetings with the government and her own party, Senator Kernot declared that the concessions from the government had made the budget fairer, and her party would now support most of the tax changes.
The government has agreed to help low earners, reduce the increase in petrol tax and drop a plan to eliminate eye tests from medicare. To help pay for the changes, the income tax cuts will be delayed a little, and tobacco taxes will be increased. At the end of this week the Greens were holding out for more concessions.
Because of Mr Keating's perceived weakness, he is going to have trouble ending a union monopoly over wage bargaining. plan--though criticised by businessmen as too mild--has until now been a symbol of his determination to push for economic reform, despite resistance from his own supporters.
Mr Keating intends to press ahead in September with legislation to settle questions raised by a High Court decision on aborigine land rights. Mining companies and farmers want assurances that their land will remain secure. But some people doubt whether Mr Keating has the patience to settle this complex matter satisfactorily.
He is still a force to be reckoned with, but is now regarded as vulnerable. The opposition leader, John Hewson, has also taken a lot of criticism, particularly for his elaborate election-losing manifesto. But Mr Keating's troubles have muted the calls for him to be replaced.
Mr Hewson may not have to wait for a full term of three years to test Mr Keating again. If the Senate, now in a mood to flex its muscles, repeatedly seeks to block legislation, the government can call an early election for both houses of Parliament. For the moment, though, Mr Keating is unlikely to be tempted. Mr Hewson would be the probable winner.","Like the Tories in Britain , Australia 's Labor government had an unexpected win in its recent general election .

Even in the lucky country it is improbable for everyone to be a winner. The premier of Western Australia grumbled that the legislation proposed by Mr Keating could lead to long court battles, so there might be losers as well as winners. But most Australians appeared to be happy, and relieved, that the question of aborigine land need no longer disturb their consciences.
The question came into national prominence last year when the High Court decided that a few square kilometres of land in an island in the Torres Strait had been originally settled by aborigines and that their descendants, led by an aborigine leader called Eddie Mabo, were holders of ""native title"". Until then Australian law had assumed that the country was unoccupied until the white settlers arrived.
The court did not spell out precisely where ""native title"" applied elsewhere in Australia, but the ""Mabo judgment"" gave enormous encouragement to aborigine groups campaigning for land rights. Fears grew among farmers and mining companies about the security of their land. For months Mr Keating appeared to vacillate. It seemed that either the miners and farmers or the aborigines would be left out in the cold. This week, after a long cabinet meeting ending at midnight, the prime minister announced his grand plan that he said would be acceptable to all.
The aborigines were promised new laws acknowledging their claims to much of the land used by their ancestors. But farmers who had worked their land since 1975 would be exempt from aborigine claims. As for the miners, they were assured that decisions about ""economic use"" of the land would remain with Australia's six states. Should any aborigines be barred from claiming certain types of land--such as farmland--they would be compensated by the government.
The majority of Australia's estimated 300,000 aborigines (in a population of 17m) are unlikely to have grounds for a land claim land or compensation. But Mr Keating had something for them too: what was described as a generous, but unspecified, ""social justice package"".",""" IT 's a win , a win for everyone , "" said Paul Keating on October 19th , announcing Paul Keating's solution to Australia 's aborigine land problem .

The Australian prime minister has been known to call his opponents ""scumbags"", ""perfumed gigolos"" and ""brain-damaged loony crims"". Unfortunately for Mr Keating, Malaysians are thinner-skinned than Australians. He caused a three-week-long row by using the R-word to describe Mahathir Mohamad, Malaysia's prime minister, after Dr Mahathir refused to attend the Asia-Pacific summit in Seattle last month. The row sounded as though it might have been defused on December 8th, when Dr Mahathir said he was willing to accept Mr Keating's expression of regret. He could not, however, be sure that his cabinet would agree: ""It's people's feelings. I have no control over them.""
To outsiders, the vehemence of the Malaysian reaction to Mr Keating's comment may have seemed odd. But the edginess of Malaysia's relationship with Australia stems from something more uncomfortable than a difference in manners: though Australia officially wants to be part of the world's boom continent, not all Asians think that the Australians, most of whom are the descendants of white colonials, qualify. Dr Mahathir, Asia's prickliest leader, is the loudest exponent of that view.
Australia has been edging away from its colonial heritage and towards Asia since the ""whites-only"" immigration policy was junked in 1973. Immigration from Asia has been rising sharply (see chart). (Chart omitted) Mr Keating's suggestion that Australia should sever its ties with the British monarchy and become a republic dovetails neatly with his insistence that Australia is Asian. But though many Australians now feel remote from Britain, opinion polls show that few regard themselves as Asian.
Nor are Asians rushing to embrace the Australians. An Australian diplomat dealing with South-East Asia says that the Thais treat Australia's insistence that it is Asian with ""bemused tolerance"". Other countries are more hostile, suspecting Australia of acting as a stalking-horse for western interests. When the Asian members of the United Nations held a meeting to formulate a joint approach to human rights, the Australians asked to be included. They were relegated to the position of ""observer"".
Still, there have been successes, such as the part Australia played in framing the Cambodian peace agreement. Its hyperactive foreign minister, Gareth Evans, is now likely to try to promote an Asian conference on Myanmar. And he has managed to get the Australians back on cordial terms with Indonesia, whose government has in the past objected to, among other matters, Australian newspaper reports suggesting that some members of President Suharto's family are corrupt.
The Australians have a keen interest in building institutions to substitute for their lack of easy cultural links with other Asian countries. Lying behind the Mahathir-Keating imbroglio is a clash over the architecture of new regional organisations. Bob Hawke, Mr Keating's predecessor, thought up the forum for Asia-Pacific Economic Co-operation (APEC), which has got off the ground with American backing. Dr Mahathir has been pushing his idea for an East Asian Economic Caucus (EAEC), which would exclude Australia as well as America. Malaysian moodiness may spring partly from resentment that Mr Hawke's baby is doing better than Dr Mahathir's.
The Australians do not see APEC merely as a friendly gathering: they want it to develop into a free-trade area. Economics drives Australia's Asia-friendliness. The row with Malaysia is especially painful because Australian trade with Malaysia has been growing by 25% a year and the Australians have a surplus. They are particularly worried about an Australian bid for a $2 billion contract to build Malaysian naval patrol boats; the defence minister said this week that Australia could ""lose an edge"" in the competition. Malaysia is delighted to find it has some weight to throw around: Mohammad Rahmat, the information minister, says with evident satisfaction that ""Australia depends on Asia and not the other way around.""
In the 1950s, more than half of Australian exports went to Europe. These days Japan is Australia's largest trading partner and South-East Asia alone is a larger market than either the European Union (formerly the Community) or the United States. Australia has the rare distinction of enjoying a trade surplus with Japan. As the Japanese economy sinks into recession, so South-East Asia grows in importance. Australian exports to the countries of the Association of South-East Asian Nations (ASEAN) have grown by 340% over the past decade.
Australia worries that its share of Asian markets has remained static for some years, and that its exports are still, in large part, raw materials. Gold and oil are its two largest exports to Singapore. Iron ore and coal make up 30% of exports to South Korea. Agricultural exports are the biggest item going to Malaysia. Too many raw materials mean too little value added and too few jobs created. The Australians want better access to Asian markets, so they can sell their neighbours technology and services.
Over the past decade Australia has made sharp, unilateral cuts in the high tariffs that once protected domestic industries like footwear and clothing. But its attempts to get Asian countries to respond in kind have not been successful. ""Their attitude is that if we're stupid enough to cut our tariffs without getting anything in return, that's our problem,"" according to an Australian diplomat.
Just before the Mahathir row blew up, the Thais had informally suggested that Australia might join AFTA, the embryonic ASEAN free-trade area. The suggestion was hit on the head by the Malaysians. That leaves the GATT as the repository of Australian free-trade hopes.

Or, as Ralph Willis, the treasurer (finance minister), prefers to put it, they show the ""best conjuncture of economic fundamentals for 30 years"".
Australia went into recession in 1990 before any other industrialised country, and Australians had grown weary of waiting for a solid recovery. But, as followers of the small print at the end ofthis newspaper will have noticed, industrial production and retail sales are up and unemployment is a touch down compared with a year ago. What may have done the trick are lower interest rates and a hefty budget stimulus. Mr Willis says growth in the financial year to June will be 3.5% instead of the 2.75% previously predicted; and that inflation will be 2% instead of the 3.5% predicted. Short-term interest rates have come down to a respectable 4.6%.
Paul Keating, the prime minister of the Labor government, needs some good news. In the past two months he has lost two ministers and this week a third seemed vulnerable. John Dawkins, Mr Willis's predecessor, gave up seemingly because he was tired of commuting thousands of miles from his home to Canberra. Alan Griffith, the industry minister, resigned after claims that Labor Party money had been used in his business, a sandwich shop. Now Ros Kelly, the sports minister, has been accused of favouring marginal Labor constituencies when handing out government money for sports facilities. The Australian Democrats, a small party that holds the balance of power in the Senate, says that Mrs Kelly, a close ally of Mr Keating, should be sacked.
Whatever his party troubles, Mr Keating can find consolation in the debilitating leadership brawl within the opposition Liberal (conservative) Party. The Liberal leader, John Hewson, held on to his job despite losing last year's general election against the odds. But, having abandoned the most unpopular part of his zealous election platform--a new 15% consumption tax--he has lost his political passion, and now seems to stand for little.
Of the half a dozen pretenders to the party leadership, the most prominent is Bronwyn Bishop, a populist senator who is said to model herself on Margaret Thatcher. Many conservatives in the parliamentary party do not like her, complaining that she has not served a long enough apprenticeship to aim for the top, and has shown no skills in presenting policy. But many voters like her need style. A recent opinion poll gave Mrs Bishop the support of 34% of those questioned, compared with Mr Hewson's rating of 13%.
Mrs Bishop snubbed a seat in the shadow cabinet because it was not senior enough. Then she engaged in an exhausting round of engagements throughout Australia, sometimes showing up in the same town as Mr Hayson and stealing the limelight. Mr Hewson conceded defeat and gave her the job of spokeswoman for regional affairs, allowing her to range over a host of policy issues. She marked the occasion by keeping Mr Hewson waiting half an hour at a congratulatory press conference.
On February 26th Mrs Bishop will contest a by-election in a Sydney constituency that she will almost certainly win, taking her from the Senate to the powerful lower house where she can share the stage with Mr Hewson, and Mr Keating. But no quick resolution is likely over the opposition leadership.

That justification, offered by Anwar Ibrahim, Malaysia's finance minister, for his country's decision to shut out British companies from lucrative government contracts in Malaysia, will have resonated in much of the rest of Asia.
Mr Anwar's comment captured the mixture of pride and resentment of former colonies, which now find their economies growing much faster than those of old colonial powers. In countries like Malaysia, Singapore and Indonesia, Europe's recession and America's social problems are often interpreted as signs of long-term decline in the West. By contrast, rapid economic growth and social stability in much of East Asia are regarded as evidence of a long-term transfer of power towards Asia. Buoyed by the feeling that history is on their side, many Asian leaders are becoming more assertive in their dealings with the West. Western pressure over human rights or labour issues is dismissed as springing from envy, or a desire to hobble Asian economies. Restrictions on freedom of speech in Asia are defended as necessary to promote stability and growth.
Not so long ago, it was a truth universally acknowledged that developing nations were locked into a subordinate relationship with the advanced capitalist powers. But a booming East and a recession-hit West have reversed that familiar academic theme. With non-Japanese Asia planning to spend $1 trillion on infrastructure projects over the next decade, many western companies are desperate to get a slice of the action.
Asian leaders, eagerly wooed by businessmen and diplomats alike, are coming to the conclusion that it is the developed world which is increasingly dependent on developing economies. Inevitably, that creates a temptation to use economic power to achieve political ends. After all, argues Mahathir Mohamad, the Malaysian prime minister, that is what the West has been doing for years. The Chinese, faced with the threat that America will rescind most-favoured-nation privileges because of human-rights abuses, would doubtless agree.
Indeed, the Chinese are also threatening to penalise British companies, to express their displeasure at British policy in Hong Kong. Will this trend spread? After all, there is no shortage of Asian countries with grievances similar to those of the Malaysians. The Indonesians have had a series of furious spats with the foreign news media, over western coverage of East Timor; and when the Sydney Morning Herald compared President Suharto to Ferdinand Marcos some years back, the Indonesians turned away a planeload of Australian tourists and broke off co-operation on defence.
The Singaporeans, who like the Malaysians and the Chinese severely restrict the use of satellite dishes, regularly tangle with the western media. Even the easy-going Thais have expressed their outrage at reports in the western press that their army has continued to supply the Khmers Rouges.
Yet, despite such similarities, Malaysia's drastic action reflects a number of national peculiarities--in particular, the personality of the prime minister. Dr Mahathir has made bashing the West something of a hobby. Unlike previous Malaysian prime ministers, he was educated in Asia, not Britain, and he is deeply sensitive to perceived slights from western nations. He has used strident rhetoric to raise his profile internationally and to rally support domestically.
In a recent dispute with Australia, whose prime minister, Paul Keating, described his Malaysian counterpart as ""recalcitrant"", Dr Mahathir also hinted that he might use trade as a weapon. That brought a partial apology from Mr Keating and may have emboldened the Malaysian prime minister to take a tough line with the British.
Malaysia's all-out attacks on its critics contrast with Singapore's handling of similar disputes. The Malaysians have said that it is up to the British government to rein in the British press. Mr Major no doubt wishes that he had the sort of relationship with his troublesome fourth estate that the Malaysians' naive demand implies. The Singaporeans, who are also frequently infuriated by the western press, take a more sophisticated line--surgical strikes, restricting the circulation of offending newspapers (including, last year, The Economist).
Aware of their dependence on the global economy, the Singaporeans have been scrupulous about keeping political sensitivity separate from business interests. As a western diplomat puts it: ""The Singaporeans always think several moves ahead. They would never have backed themselves into a corner like the Malaysians.""
The Thai and Philippine governments tend not to react sharply to criticism, perhaps because they are used to a domestic press snapping at their heels; though occasionally the Thai government bans an edition of a newspaper for making slihting remarks about the Thai royal family. The Indonesians, Vietnamese and Burmese share Malaysia's loathing of the western press, but are much more keenly aware of their need to attract western investment and technology. So although many of these countries' politicians may approve of Dr Mahathir's actions, few are likely to follow his example--yet.",""" We believe the foreign media must learn the fact that developing countries , including a country led by a brown Muslim , have the ability to manage their own affairs successfully .

The Indonesians have had a series of furious spats with the foreign news media , over western coverage of East Timor ; and when the Sydney Morning Herald compared President Suharto to Ferdinand Marcos some years back , the Indonesians turned away a planeload of Australian tourists and broke off co - operation on defence . 
 The Singaporeans , who like the Malaysians and the Chinese severely restrict the use of satellite dishes , regularly tangle with the western media . Even the easy - going Thais have expressed their outrage at reports in the western press that their army has continued to supply the Khmers Rouges . 
 Yet , despite such similarities , Malaysia 's drastic action reflects a number of national peculiarities -- in particular , the personality of the prime minister . Dr Mahathir has made bashing the West something of a hobby . Unlike previous Malaysian prime ministers , he was educated in Asia , not Britain , and he is deeply sensitive to perceived slights from western nations . He has used strident rhetoric to raise his profile internationally and to rally support domestically . 
 In a recent dispute with Australia , whose prime minister , Paul Keating , described Paul Keating's Malaysian counterpart as "" recalcitrant "" , Dr Mahathir also hinted that he might use trade as a weapon . That brought a partial apology from Paul Keating and may have emboldened the Malaysian prime minister to take a tough line with the British . 
 Malaysia 's all - out attacks on its critics contrast with Singapore 's handling of similar disputes . The Malaysians have said that it is up to the British government to rein in the British press . Mr Major no doubt wishes that he had the sort of relationship with his troublesome fourth estate that the Malaysians ' naive demand implies . The Singaporeans , who are also frequently infuriated by the western press , take a more sophisticated line -- surgical strikes , restricting the circulation of offending newspapers ( including , last year , The Economist ) . 
 Aware of their dependence on the global economy , the Singaporeans have been scrupulous about keeping political sensitivity separate from business interests . As a western diplomat puts it : "" The Singaporeans always think several moves ahead . They would never have backed themselves into a corner like the Malaysians . "" 
 The Thai and Philippine governments tend not to react sharply to criticism , perhaps because they are used to a domestic press snapping at their heels ; though occasionally the Thai government bans an edition of a newspaper for making slihting remarks about the Thai royal family . The Indonesians , Vietnamese and Burmese share Malaysia 's loathing of the western press , but are much more keenly aware of their need to attract western investment and technology . So although many of these countries ' politicians may approve of Dr Mahathir 's actions , few are likely to follow his example -- yet .",900,Australia,A29-8965,IN TERM,True,Mr Keating,2,True

Rather than resign--as he said he would do if he lost--he clung on, to the dismay of many party supporters. On May 23rd, after months of infighting, the Liberal Party eventually sacked 47-year-old Mr Hewson and replaced him with Alexander Downer, who, at 42, becomes the fifth Liberal leader since Labor came to power 11 years ago.
Paul Keating, the prime minister, lost no time in branding Mr Downer's promotion a victory for rich Australians rather than for the majority. ""In Mr Downer's case,"" said Mr Keating, ""it's going to be a case of reupholstering the deck chairs rather than reshuffling them.""
Mr Downer is regarded by Australians as a blue-blood. His grandfather helped to write the Australian constitution in the 1890s and was a member of the first federal parliament. His father, Sir Alexander Downer, was in the Liberal governments of the 1950s and 1960s headed by Sir Robert Menzies. Young Alexander learned about politics at the family dinner table.
Mr Downer has already sought to recapture the momentum of his father's era, when the Liberals were the natural party of government. ""I am born of the Liberal Party,"" he announced. He went on to define the party as ""a broad church"" and attacked the dogmatism of Labor, which had become a ""neo-corporate party"" devoted to doing deals with interest groups.
Though he has yet to be specific about his policies, Mr Downer has more political savvy than Mr Hewson and more definite opinions. On Mr Keating's plan for an Australian republic by 2000, he says: ""It's a massively difficult task to change the basis of the head of state...So I doubt that the republic is going to come for a very long time, if it comes at all.""
Whereas Mr Hewson tended to be skewered by Mr Keating's parlimentary invective, Mr Downer says he will make the prime minister's style a political issue: ""I don't think there's any need in Australian politics for anyone to be as downright offensive as Mr Keating.""
Australian newspapers and business groups welcomed the change as one likely to revive the opposition. Mr Hewson, an academic economist, had few political skills and often appeared to be out of touch on many popular issues. An opinion poll for the Sydney Morning Herald just after Mr Downer's election said that 41% of those questioned believed he would make a better prime minister than Mr Keating, who received 32% support. In a poll a week earlier the figures had been 46% for Mr Keating and 28% for Mr Hewson.","Ever since John Hewson , the leader of opposition Liberal ( conservative ) Party , lost the "" unlosable "" Australian general election last year and handed a fifth term of government to Labor , he has looked like a dead duck politically .

This is 10,000 more than the year before, but includes 8,300 Chinese students already in Australia who want to stay. With the number of departures not much smaller than arrivals, Australia's population will remain little changed at 17m.
Because of the recession, the yearly quota had already been cut back from the high levels of the 1980s.

The prime minister, Paul Keating, said recently that he favoured training ""our own people"" in new skills rather than relying on immigration.
""Our own people"" are a pretty mixed lot, and so are Australia's immigrants. Britain is still the single largest source of migrants, though its share is down from 44.3% in 1962-63 to 12% in 1992-93.

Should a Liberal government replace Labor, even fewer migrants are likely to be allowed in. During the 1980s the Liberal Party engaged in an acrimonious debate over the relatively high levels of immirants from Asia. Although the ""white Australia"" policy was formally abandoned in 1972, politicians have occasionally been tempted to exploit racist sentiment.

The Reluctant Republic. By Malcolm Turnbull. Heinemann; 480 pages; L12.99
Reading Manning Clark's influential, and controversial, six-volume ""History of Australia"" is a bit like tilling a field with a knife and fork. This intelligent abridgement reduces the task to a manageable size without sacrificing the sweep of Clark's original vision. The story stretches from the first white settlement in 1788 to the 1930s. Clark's central theme is the quest of Australians for a definition of themselves, particularly as a white outpost on the rim of Asia and as a European culture in an unforgiving physical environment.
Settling America was an act of freedom. Australia was colonised by those who had no choice--convicts and their military overseers--and Clark emphasises how cataclysmic their arrival was for the Aborigines. The role of government, either as provider or persecutor, loomed large. Most of the convicts were either exiled Irish political prisoners or criminals, mainly from England, in transported to ease the pressure on overcrowded jails. The Irish political prisoners were as feisty, republican and Catholic as Paul Keating, the country's current prime minister. The English, together with the military men and a smattering of free settlers, wanted mainly Protestant respectability under a British crown.
The new land was no Eden. English crops died in the ground. But sheep prospered, and those settlers made rich by wool and grants of land entertained visions of a quasi-feudal economy built on convict labour. When transportation was ended, it was due to a change of policy in London rather than because Australians wanted a society of free men and women. The discovery of gold in 1851 dealt another blow to the squattocracy, from which it never quite recovered.
Even though some voices argued for a loosening of the imperial connection, throughout the 19th century there was no doubt in most minds that to be Australian was also to be British. The well-to-do affected English manners and dress; a trip to London was the ultimate ambition of the upwardly mobile. Even after the federation of the six colonies in 1901, the Australian government preferred Britain to handle its foreign affairs and defence.
But the first world war, in which Australian soldiers were slaughtered in their thousands for no obvious gain, gave rise to increasing doubts. Perhaps, after all, the interests of Britain and Australia did not always coincide. After the 1929 crash there was even talk of withholding repayments on overseas loans. The crisis passed but Australia could never return to the unquestioning acceptance of Britain's guidance. If not British, then what? Caught between stools, suggests Clark. The moment of definition had eluded Australians in Clark's time and, it might be said, eludes them still. Although not if Malcolm Turnbull has his way. The Australian lawyer who made Lord Armstrong appear a complete buffoon in the famous Spycatcher case is impatient to see his country become a republic. In a lucid and intelligent book, he argues that a nation defines itself by being different. Only colonies continue to borrow the monarchies of other lands.","History of Australia. By Manning Clark.

As the dust settles, financial analysts are concluding that, whereas the sell-off of American bonds was probably a sensible response to worries about inflation in the United States, plunges in some other markets were unjustified. Those that were usually uncorrelated, or only weakly correlated with one another, fell together. As the panic subsides, the old patterns of correlation (or lack thereof) may reappear. If they do, Australia's financial markets could be among the first to benefit.
The Australian bond market, in particular, has traditionally diverged sharply from America's--so much so that holding Australian bonds is widely regarded as one of the best ways to diversify risk in an international bond portfolio. Yet Australian bonds have recently been more sensitive to events in America than have the bonds of many other developed countries. Since February 3rd, the day before America's Federal Reserve raised interest rates by a quarter of a percentage point, Australian ten-year bond yields have soared by around three points. Over the same period, yields on American Treasury bonds have risen by 1.7 points; and government bonds worldwide by an average of around two points.
Why have Australia's markets been so badly shaken? Richard Gibbs, an economist at Macquarie Bank, one of the country's biggest financial-services groups, points out that Sydney has an exceptionally large and liquid futures market relative to the size of its underlying cash market. This made it a favourite destination for international hedge funds looking to reduce their government-bond exposure in a hurry while still limiting their losses. (Selling futures has less immediate impact on the underlying price of bonds than sales in the cash market.)
Moreover, Australia's history of high inflation, and its large current-account deficit, meant that international investors were less reassured by the Australian government's pledges to squash inflation than by those of, say, the governor of New Zealand's independent central bank. Since February 3rd, yields on New Zealand government bonds have risen by less than those on Australian ones.
Politics has not helped Australia's cause. Paul Keating, the prime minister, has pooh-poohed the markets' fear of inflation. Yet his Labor government's May budget, which included a fiscal boost and a job-creation package, did little to reassure investors. And the excuse that this was a pre-election budget has started to wear thin since a recovery in the fortunes of the opposition Liberal Party has silenced talk of a snap election.
Even so, Australia's annual rate of inflation is a mere 1.4%--one of the lowest since the 1960s. And although interest rates are low, no one expects inflation to edge up before the end of next year. In a significant speech in Tokyo on July 13th, Bernie Fraser, the governor of the Reserve Bank, Australia's central bank, hinted that the differences of opinion over inflation between the bank and the markets were smaller than generally thought.
After initial confusion, the markets seem to have concluded that Mr Fraser will raise short-term interest rates, which currently stand at 4.7%, by the end of the year. The prospect of a rate rise was reinforced on July 19th, when news leaked of a letter from the Reserve Bank to commercial banks threatening them with tough action if the boom in mortgage-lending is not curtailed soon. Australian home loans have grown by some 20% a year since the start of 1992.
WIZARD IN OZ
Adrian Blundell-Wignall, an economist in the Sydney office of Bankers Trust, an American investment bank, reckons that interest rates could rise by between one-half and one percentage point before the end of the year. If they do, bond prices could rise sharply, says Mr Blundell-Wignall, especially since Australia is unlikely to pose much currency risk for international investors.
He has a point. Since last autumn, the Australian dollar has risen sharply against America's (see chart). (Chart omitted) The reason is rising commodity prices. Around two-thirds of Australia's exports are commodities, which means that the country's terms of trade are closely linked to changes in their prices.
Admittedly, current bullish forecasts of commodity-price rises, which are based on an assumption of growing demand as world output recovers, may be overdone. Having given up on bond markets, hedge funds have been speculating in commodity-futures markets, driving up forward prices. Yet even if the prices of commodities in which Australia is rich, such as coal and iron ore, rise only gradually, it is hard to see the Australian dollar weakening over the next year or so.
A rise in commodity prices and a bond-market rally should boost Australian share prices, too. Indeed, since July 11th, when bond prices began to move up slightly, Sydney's stockmarket index has soared by more than 5%. Brad Holland, an economist with J.P. Morgan, an American investment bank, points out that although Australian firms' price-earnings ratios are not much above their historic averages, and many are about to begin a record-breaking results season, they have probably done as much as they can to increase their margins. That may not stop investors from returning to Australia as fast as they deserted it earlier this year.","The financial - market rout that began in February has provoked much debate about whether investors have been behaving rationally .

 Admittedly , current bullish forecasts of commodity - price rises , which are based on an assumption of growing demand as world output recovers , may be overdone . Having given up on bond markets , hedge funds have been speculating in commodity - futures markets , driving up forward prices . Yet even if the prices of commodities in which Australia is rich , such as coal and iron ore , rise only gradually , it is hard to see the Australian dollar weakening over the next year or so . 
 A rise in commodity prices and a bond - market rally should boost Australian share prices , too . Indeed , since July 11th , when bond prices began to move up slightly , Sydney 's stockmarket index has soared by more than 5 % . Brad Holland , an economist with J.P. Morgan , an American investment bank , points out that although Australian firms ' price - earnings ratios are not much above their historic averages , and many are about to begin a record - breaking results season , they have probably done as much as they can to increase their margins .

In Brisbane on August 1st, at a summit of the South Pacific Forum comprising 15 countries from the region, Sir Geoffrey Henry, prime minister of the Cook Islands, summed up the feeling of the meeting: ""We have been ripped off.""
Sir Geoffrey was referring to the state of the region's forests and fisheries, the economic mainstays for most island nations, which are being exploited mainly by Asian companies. Since 1991, the rate at which tropical hardware timbers have been torn out of the rainforests of Papua New Guinea and the Solomon Islands has trebled to well beyond sustainable levels.
Francis Hilly, prime minister of the Solomon Islands. once a British protectorate, told fellow heads of government: ""At this rate, unfortunately, all commercial timber in the country would be cut out within 15 years."" The 360,000 Solomon Islanders see little return. A group of landowners last year got $2.70 a cubic metre for their logs from a foreign company which then sold them for $350 a cubic metre.
The logging companies in both Papua New Guinea and the Solomon Islands are mainly Malaysian. With their own government trying to control logging in Sabah and Sarawak, the Malaysians have turned to Pacific countries where few such controls apply. They have been spurred by lucrative contracts with Japan and South Korea and booming world prices.
An independent report to the forum, commissioned by the Australian government, suggested that some Pacific countries were losing half their potential national income through unmonitored loin exports--enough to build thousands of classrooms and health clinics. Papua New Guinea's losses were said to be equivalent to the A$327m ($241m ) of aid it receives annually from Australia.
The South Pacific's fisheries, which supply about 40% of the world's catch, brought the main ""distant water fishing nations""--Japan, the United States, South Korea and Taiwan--about $1.5 billion last year. The Pacific islanders in whose waters they fished received a bare $50m in access fees.
For the island nations, the Brisbane forum was something of a watershed in confronting the realities of their exploitation. The forum was founded in 1971, before most of them were independent, and was dominated during the 1980s by Australia and New Zealand. While Asia has grown spectacularly since then, the Pacific islands next door are stagnating Their populations are expanding faster than their economies, unemployment is getting worse and corruption is entrenched. Villagers on remote islands are easily won over by foreign logging and fishing companies offering them the roads, schools and services that central governments have failed to provide.
As host of the Brisbane summit, Paul Keating, the Australian prime minister, described what was going on as ""environmental piracy"" and laid the groundwork for getting the island leaders to draw up new rules for managing their resources properly. The forum countries agreed on August 2nd to adopt a common code covering all foreign logging companies, and to replace ad hoc fishing agreements with multilateral contracts.
Both moves are aimed at keeping stocks at sustainable levels and earning more money. Australia also agreed to take over A$2m of the Solomon Islands' debt in return for a ban on logging around the beautiful Marovo Lagoon.
Representatives of Greenpeace, an environmental group, were quick to challenge Australia's claim to the moral high ground. They pointed out that the South Pacific was facing two severe dangers, rising sea levels and dying coral reefs, which they blamed on global warming caused by greenhouse gas emissions. Australia and New Zealand, they argued, were among the worst local offenders. This brought a tart response from Mr Keating. ""Greenpeace wouldn't know a win if it fell over it,"" he said, referring to the forum's forestry agreement.
Still, Greenpeace found an ally in Kamuta Latasi, prime minister of Tuvalu, whose 9,000 inhabitants live on atolls barely 6 metres above sea level. Mr Latasi said he feared that his tiny country would become the world's first to disappear under rising sea levels, and that Australia should be prepared to accept the entire population as immigrants if this happened.

This is a pity, because the period between Mr Hawke's election as the head of the Labor Party and his toppling in a party-room brawl saw many remarkable achievements. They included financial deregulation, the start of privatisation and the winding back of protectionist policies.
Under his leadership, the Labor Party presented itself as uniquely reflecting a national consensus on values yet capable of taking tough decisions for the long-term good of the country. It was helped immeasurably by the foolishness of its political opponents, who plunged into a decade of ideological self-destruction.
Unfortunately, this book is not worthy of the Hawke era. It makes it look, at best, an over-cooked stew of personal antagonisms and conflicting ambitions. Mr Hawke believes that his party won four successive elections only because he was its leader, and he further believes that he could have led his party to a fifth victory. He does not mention that Labor won in 1993 not only without him, but with Paul Keating, whom he regarded as almost unelectable, at its head.
Inevitably, Mr Hawke's relations with Mr Keating are the most interesting part of the book. They formed a highly effective political team for several years, but from 1987 onwards Mr Hawke saw his treasurer as motivated primarily by ambition and ready to risk the whole government in order to have his ""turn"". By Mr Hawke's account, Mr Keating made it plain that if he did not get his turn he would leave ""the arse-end of the world"" (a remark Mr Keating denies making).
Mr Hawke claims that the secret agreement he entered into to hand the top job over to Mr Keating half-way through Labor's fourth term was needed to keep the government together. He steps around the accusation that he repeatedly lied about the existence of such a pact. The reason he gives for repudiating it--that only he could ensure victory--sounds as hollow as it did when it first surfaced in 1991.
Mr Hawke is bitter about the way Mr Keating undermined the government after he, Mr Hawke, refused to go peacefully. After his first challenge failed, Mr Keating began to corrode the government's authority. He won on the second try after his supporters made it clear to the party that their subterranean fight would continue until Mr Hawke resigned. Rough tactics--but similar to those used by Mr Hawke to displace his predecessor.
There is something pathetic about the manner in which Mr Hawke explains all this--and about his inability to accept that the time had come for him to depart. He played the political game as ruthlessly as anybody, and this bid for sympathy now smacks of hypocrisy. The Hawke era deserves a better obituary.

Japan's open admission of its UN aspirations follows years of more discreet campaigning. The main tactic has been to prompt other countries to say how nice it would be if Japan had the seat it wants. Recently almost no foreign statesman has visited Tokyo without joining the chorus.
This month, for example, Australia's prime minister, Paul Keating, came to Tokyo in order (he thought) to discuss trade. Japan's government and press showed little interest in his commercial ideas. But the newspapers were full of stories about Mr Keating's declaration that ""Japan's absence from the Security Council is an anachronism."" Some suspect that the words were put into his mouth. Three days earlier Argentina's foreign minister used the same formulation in the course of a meeting with Mr Kono.
All in all, 40 countries have publicly backed Japan's candidacy. Last month the leaders of the Philippines and Malaysia added their voices, so strengthening Japan's claim to speak for resurgent Asia. The final boost to Japanese confidence came with the visit to Tokyo of the UN's secretary-general, Boutros Boutros-Ghali, starting on September 11th. He declared that Japan deserved a permanent seat on the Security Council, along with a veto over its decisions. With this kind of support, Japan feels it can be frank about its ambitions.
Whose ambitions exactly? This is in fact a victory for Japan's foreign ministry over the current government. Japan's coalition of liberals and socialists took power in June, claiming to be ""doveish"". This meant that it favoured a strict interpretation of Japan's pacifist constitution, and so would shrink from sending troops abroad to take part in UN peacekeeping missions. At the same time, the government said it was in no hurry to join the permanent members of the Security Council, since this might entail a role as world policeman. The prime minister, Tomiichi Murayama, repeated this view in Singapore as recently as August 28th.
The diplomats have finessed these objections. Mr Boutros-Ghali helpfully emphasised that permanent membership of the Security Council does not necessarily entail sending troops abroad. (Indeed, the UN's poorer members provide most of the men for peacekeeping.) This offered Mr Murayama a way to marry national ambition with pacifist principle. One of his cabinet colleagues, Ryutaro Hashimoto, argues that Japan should use a permanent seat as a platform to argue for world disarmament.
The diplomats are confident that pacifist talk will not reverse the steady build-up of Japan's international role. An election next year may conceivably shift power to the hawkish opposition, which fared well in a recent by-election (see next story). Besides, the current government seems prepared to compromise its stance on peacekeeping.

INFLATION in Australia was a mere 1.7W in the year to September. But the economy is growing quickly. On October 24th the government moved to quell a possible rise in inflation by lifting the official interest rate by one percentage point to 6.5%--the second increase in two months. Preemptive moves against inflation are the Fashion; Australia was following similar moves by America and Britain.
Paul Keating's Labor government was attacked by the parliamentary opposition for the rise. ""Every time Mr Keating sees a bit of life in the economy, he reaches for his gun and shoots a home buyer,"" said an opposition spokesman, Peter Costello, recalling the crippling interest rates of the late 1980s, when Mr Keating was treasurer (finance minister). Such high interest rates helped to send the economy into recession.
But the government could not ignore the growth shown by almost every indicator, despite the dulling effect of a severe drought in eastern Australia. Employment is rowing at close to 4% a year; investment is starting to recover after a three-year slump; GDP grew 4.3% in the year to June.
The government is now coming under increasing pressure to look to another arm of economic policy, its budget, due in May. Mr Keating was never one to take kindly to criticism, and on October 24th lashed out at the ""deficit Daleks"" who want faster cuts in the budget deficit than the proposed 1% of GDP, about A$5 billion (US$3.7 billion), by 1996-97. In 1992-93 the deficit was A$14.6 billion or 3.6% of GDP.
But the Daleks include the governor of the Reserve Bank, Bernie Fraser, and the secretary of the Treasury, Ted Evans. They say the government should cut the deficit further to take the heat out of interest rates and encourage private investment. The recent rise in the current account deficit, to more than A$2 billion a month or almost 4% of GDP, due largely to a surge in imports for new investment, adds weight to their pleas. Ralph Willis, the current treasurer, has said that the government will tighten all aspects of policy, if need be, to prevent the economy overheating, but has stopped short of judging that this day has arrived.
The opposition is working hard to exploit the debate. It can make life difficult for the government, which does not have control of the Senate, the upper house. Last year the opposition tried to block A$3 billion in new taxes. The government dot most of its tax changes through only with the help of minor parties in the Senate.
With an election due by mid-1997 Mr Keating is not keen to raise taxes in next year's budget. But he argues that, with public spending in Australia the third lowest of any industrialised country, the government does not have much room for further spending cuts.","Australia

MENZIES' CHILD: THE LIBERAL PARTY OF AUSTRALIA 1944-1994. By Gerard Henderson. Allen & Unwin; 381 pages; A$29.95
THE Liberal Party of Australia has been office (in coalition with the rural-based Nationals) at national level for 30 of its 50 years. But it has lost the past five federal elections to the Labor Party. On the olden anniversary of the founding of the Liberal Party, Gerard Henderson, a conservative gadfly, poses a simple question: what happened?
Part of his answer is that the party has never quite escaped the influence of its founder, Robert Menzies, who was prime minister for 17 years after 1949. Helped by the astounding incompetence of his Labor opponents, he won the support of the growing suburban middle-class. He delivered prosperity and stability while emphasising that his party stood for homespun values.
For a generation, the Liberals looked a party that was born to rule. But the seeds of disaster were evident in the fruits of victory. Too much depended on the leader, and Menzies's successors lacked the talent either to follow in the great man's footsteps or to fashion their own course.
Mr Henderson identifies a deeper malaise in the party's anti-intellectual character, which hamper its attempts to respond to changes in the nation's cultural identity. Over the past 20 years, Australia has become less British, less white, less sectarian and more prosperous, but often the Liberals seem incapable of recognising it.
The Liberals seem unable to re-shape themselves. The party has kept looking for a messiah to lead it from the wilderness: a search that has resulted in five leadership changes in a dozen years. The present leader, Alexander Downer, whose father was a member of the Menzies government, is a patrician, and there are doubts whether he has the ""bottom"" for leadership and the tactical ability to defeat the prime minister, Paul Keating.
The Liberal Party has recently tried to broaden its ranks, bringing in more women and more hyphenated Australians. The party's governing body has begun to give the political professionals more influence in selecting candidates: constituency branches, if left to themselves, tend to opt for local worthies. But the party has yet to find ways to conduct internal debates which do not degenerate into public brawls between its liberal and conservative wins. Mr Henderson also worries that the party's anti-republic stance alienates younger voters and ties the Liberals to the past.","Australian politics

The leaders of the Asia-Pacific Economic Co-operation forum feel much the same way about free trade. In Indonesia on November 15th, APEC's 18 members committed themselves to creating a free-trade area stretching from New York to Bangkok and from Chile to China. But this ambitious goal is expected to be reached only by 2020. By that time, the leaders who put their signatures to the declaration in Boor, a town in the hills south of Jakarta, will either be dead or in their dotage.
The goals set out in what will now be known as the Bogor declaration, while distant, are not meaningless. The very fact that there was a good deal of argument about what should be included in the declaration suggests that the leaders who signed it take it seriously. The Americans and Australians, who are keenest on pushing free trade, were also most determined to trumpet the declaration's virtues. Bill Clinton called it ""historic"". Paul Keating, the Australian prime minister, spoke of ""an extraordinary new path for the Asia-Pacific region towards extraordinary new goals.""
Steady on, old chap. APEC's goal of free trade is not only distant, it is also short on details. The Boor declaration stipulates that developed nations should achieve ""free and open trade"" by 2010 and developing nations by 2020. But the difference between developed and developing nations is not defined. The Americans say that by 2010 the South Koreans and even the Chinese might fall into the developed camp. The Malaysians, who are the most vocal APEC sceptics, argue that even by 2020 income per person in America is likely to be far higher than in most Asian countries. They clearly intend to hang on to their ""developing"" status and the protectionist privileges that go with it.
The Malaysians have even managed to attach an addendum to the declaration, stipulating that the date of 2020 is not binding. Mahathir Mohamad, Malaysia's prime minister, said, ""We interpret this as allowing us to go beyond 2020, if our stage of development has not yet caught up."" Tacking on some reservations was a necessary face-saving measure for Dr Mahathir, whose domestic audience knows that he has fought the development of APEC tooth and nail. But agreeing to a Malaysian opt-out sets a dangerous precedent for the forum. The Japanese and the South Koreans are already muttering about excluding agriculture from APEC's discussions.
Much of the vagueness could be hammered out of the Bogor declaration during the coming year. By the time the APEC leaders reconvene in Japan, next November, their minions are meant to have worked out a plan for the achievement of free trade. There is plenty of room for disagreement. Mr Clinton, with an eye to his domestic audience, emphasised that any trade concessions would be reciprocal and that there would be ""no free-riders"". Mr Clinton already has enough trouble at home, where the Democrats have lost control of both houses of Congress, without seeming to be making concessions abroad. But the countries of ASEAN, the Association of South-East-Asian Nations, are keener to see each country proceed unilaterally, using 2020 as a target.
Similarly, while both Mr Clinton and Mr Keating argue that tariff cuts made under APEC could go further and faster than those already agreed under the GATT, other countries, among them Japan and Thailand, emphasise that they want the World Trade Organization, which will replace the GATT, to set the pace. Mr Clinton held out the prospect of a ""negotiated downward movement"" in tariffs, but any American attempt to institutionalise tariff cutting through APEC is likely to meet resistance.
Even the Americans acknowledge that over the next five years it is highly unlikely that APEC will turn its attention to cutting tariffs. In the short term, the forum's members are likely to concentrate on measures such as standardising customs procedures and computerising documentation. That may sound rather prosaic after the visionary statements at Bogor. However, in the five years since its founding, APEC has already developed a tendency to surprise sceptics.
The most noticeable sin of this is the institutionalisation of an annual APEC summit, and with it the emergence of an Asia-Pacific version of the G7 meetings. The G7, a group of the world's most developed economies, contains only one Asian power, Japan. Yet annual consultations with the leaders of the G7 no longer fully reflect American economic ties. America now exports more to Taiwan than to France, and imports as much from China as from Germany.
Whatever the reservations of individual members about APEC, the free-trading ideas it embodies are making headway. As Dr Mahathir points out, in Malaysia's last budget his country removed import duties on over 2,000 items and cut tariffs on many others, including motor vehicles. The trend towards more open markets is noticeable in most of the rest of developing Asia. APEC may help to boost the development of trade across the Pacific.

So Mr Downer decided to provide little detail about his policies. He did not reject most of Labor's economic policies, but argued for more to be done and faster--cutting the budget, freeing the wage-fixing and labour-contracts system, and privatising the few state enterprises not already sold by Labor.
Mr Downer devised a platitude-rich but detail-free manifesto called ""The Things that Matter"". Because one section dealt with domestic violence, it became known as ""The Things that Batter"". Many Australians were unimpressed by his cheerful but sometimes frivolous manner and his British accent, acquired at school in England while his father was Australian high commissioner there.

But his restraint did not last long. Last week he accused the new opposition leader, John Howard, of having made a secret deal with Kerry Packer, one of the contestants in the battle.
Mr Packer, said to be the county's richest man, owns several television stations in Australia. Mr Keating's Labor government has passed a law making it difficult for anybody with such interests to own more than 15% of the shares in any newspaper. The law is designed to stop one owner dominating the media. Mr Keating's goal, he said at the time, was to allow media barons to be ""queen of screen or prince of print"" but not both.
Mr Howard, however, has said he thinks that media ownership should be subject to general anti-monopoly laws, not special rules on cross-media ownership. Should Mr Howard's Liberal (conservative) Party win the next general election, due by mid-1996, it is possible that the law will be changed. Mr Howard has not said he will do this, but Mr Keating is suspicious, especially now that Mr Packer has called the opposition leader an ""honest and decent man"" who would make a good prime minister.
John Fairfax Holding, the group Mr Packer is after, controls the Sydney Morning Herald, the Melbourne Age and the Australian Financial Review. Ruper Murdoch, who also covets the group, has called the Herald and the Age ""rivers of old"" because of their dominance of classified advertising in Australia's biggest cities.
Mr Murdoch, Australian-born but a naturalised American, owns about 5% in Fairfax, Australia's oldest newspaper company, and said recently that he wants to lift this to 10%. However, under another law, foreign interest in Fairfax is limited to 30% of its shares. Some 25% of Fairfax is already owned by another foreigner, Conrad Black, a Canadian. As thing stand in this unstable company, Mr Black's is the controlling interest. He wants to own more shares to consolidate his hold.
All three men, Mr Packer, Mr Murdoch and Mr Black, are waiting and hoping that the laws will eventually be changed in their favour. Then the real battle for the control of Fairfax will begin. Just granting Mr Murdoch dual nationality would exempt him from the ""foreigner"" restriction. He already controls many Australian newspapers. Mr Packer is not only a television tycoon, but he dominates the general magazine market with titles such as the top-selling Australian Women's Weekly (which, curiously, is a monthly). But both are keen to get control of Fairfax.
Mr Packer has already lifted his stake in Fairfax past the 15% threshold, arguing that the law allows him to own a larger slice of the company if he does not control it. Anyway, he said, the rules were a joke. However, the Australian Broadcasting Authority is due to decide soon whether Mr Packer has disobeyed the rules. The government has to review them by 1997, but Mr Keating says he sees no big reason for change. Change has not been kind to Mr Keating.

This is a story that would bring patriotic tears to the eyes of Jacques Delors and his former colleagues in the European Commission. Mr Delors's white paper on competitiveness, published in December 1993 at the depth of the continental recession, was the last grand gesture of his stint as president of the EU. It lamented both Europe's inability to keep up in high-tech fields, and its poor record in creating small firms, the main source of growth and new employment. The answer: any number of proposals to study the success of European entrepreneurs; to speed up the payment of invoices; to improve the perennially poor relations between banks and small firms; to create a European capital market for small firms; and so on.
As it turned out, although the recession felled the smallest businesses--ie, ones with turnover of less than L1m ($1.5m)--in their thousands, the larger small European firms (with a turnover of L1m-L100m) proved surprisingly resilient, according to Neil Cross, a director of 3i, a British venture-capital company. The relative size of these larger small firms, he argues, gave them something to cut when the going got tough.
A survey of more than 8,000 small firms (ie, less than L100m) in five European countries, the latest in a series carried out every six months by 3i, has found that entrepreneurs who survived the recession are bullish about the coming months (see chart).(Chart omitted) Having been profoundly pessimistic as recently as the second half of 1993--when 3i's performance index registered a score of -19--the index has climbed to +29, despite lingering doubts about the strength of European economic recovery.
But this improvement leaves two threats to Europe's entrepreneurs. Stephen King, an analyst at James Capel, a stockbroker in London, argues that the one thing in favour of European industry during the recession has been low wage demands. As a result, firms could afford to hire better-qualified staff and invest money saved from salaries on improving productivity instead. But wage restraint is showing worrying signs of wearing thin: witness the new strike by the powerful IG Metall union in Germany and incipient inflation in countries that have devalued, such as Italy.
A second threat, in the view of Giles Keating, of CS First Boston, another London stockbroker, comes from the awful state of government finances. With deficits to plug, many West European governments may not be able to resist raising capital-gains and payroll taxes.

Arthur Phillips, an Australian writer, defined cultural cringe almost 50 years ago:
Above our writers--and other artists--looms the intimidating mass of Anglo-Saxon culture. Such a situation almost invariably produces the characteristic Australian Cultural Cringe.
At the time, there was virtually no public funding for the performing arts in Australia, and no opera and ballet companies or local film production. In 1968 the Australian Council for the Arts, now the Australia Council, was set up to help talented people with federal grants. Cultural policy has broadened since then. It has lately been given greater coherence by ""Creative Nation"", an ambitious policy document hailed as Australia's first blueprint for the arts. The prime minister, Paul Keating, said its publication marked ""the day when we drew a line under our post-colonial era--and said goodbye to it.""
The ""Creative Nation"" policy puts less emphasis than in the past on grant-giving and more on seeking bigger audiences, export markets and private funding for the arts. It will not be easy. Corporate sponsorship of the arts in Australia has actually declined in recent years as businesses have diverted money to sport, and there are signs that this trend is accelerating in the run-up to the Olympic Games in Sydney in 20000.
Until now the arts policy has had most influence on films, where the Australian Film Finance Corporation typically enters into joint 60-40% financing deals with film producers. But with ""Creative Nation"" the policy expands into the electronic age by committing the government to lead Australia on to the information super-highway. Much of this multimedia effort is concentrated on education, of schoolchildren as well as adults. An example of how it had reached the Outback was quoted approvingly at a multimedia forum in Sydney on March 8th by Michael Lee, Australia's minister for communications and the arts, who oversees a budget of A$1 billion ($750m) a year.

The children are said to be proud--but too nicely brought up to swagger in the playground.","FOR the best part of a century, discussion about the arts in Australia has swung between ""cultural cringe"", the view that nothing produced in Australia is of much worth until it has been approved in London or New York, and ""cultural swagger"", the equally dotty notion that anything imported from the wider world is a cultural pollutant. Arthur Phillips, an Australian writer, defined cultural cringe almost 50 years ago:
Above our writers--and other artists--looms the intimidating mass of Anglo-Saxon culture. Such a situation almost invariably produces the characteristic Australian Cultural Cringe.
At the time, there was virtually no public funding for the performing arts in Australia, and no opera and ballet companies or local film production. In 1968 the Australian Council for the Arts, now the Australia Council, was set up to help talented people with federal grants. Cultural policy has broadened since then. It has lately been given greater coherence by ""Creative Nation"", an ambitious policy document hailed as Australia's first blueprint for the arts. The prime minister, Paul Keating, said its publication marked ""the day when we drew a line under our post-colonial era--and said goodbye to it.""
The ""Creative Nation"" policy puts less emphasis than in the past on grant-giving and more on seeking bigger audiences, export markets and private funding for the arts. It will not be easy. Corporate sponsorship of the arts in Australia has actually declined in recent years as businesses have diverted money to sport, and there are signs that this trend is accelerating in the run-up to the Olympic Games in Sydney in 20000.
Until now the arts policy has had most influence on films, where the Australian Film Finance Corporation typically enters into joint 60-40% financing deals with film producers. But with ""Creative Nation"" the policy expands into the electronic age by committing the government to lead Australia on to the information super-highway. Much of this multimedia effort is concentrated on education, of schoolchildren as well as adults. An example of how it had reached the Outback was quoted approvingly at a multimedia forum in Sydney on March 8th by Michael Lee, Australia's minister for communications and the arts, who oversees a budget of A$1 billion ($750m) a year.

For years the Aussies have regarded New Zealand as a minor freeloader to be alternately placated or patronised. But some evidence suggests that New Zealand is now gaining a long-term economic edge over Australia.
Certainly, after several decades of profligacy, New Zealand seems to have public spending under control. By 1998, spending is projected to fall to 30.5% of GDP. The accompanying budget surpluses should reduce net public debt from 32.1% to 18.1% of GDP by 1998--unless the government cuts taxes. By contrast, Australia seems likely to remain stuck with a budget deficit, now A$11.7 billion ($8.6 billion).
New Zealand gave a glimpse of its prospects when the government announced its budget policy in February. Under the Fiscal Responsibility Act, a law designed to make politicians keep their promises, the government has each year to provide budget projections for the next three years. This requirement for honesty caused Bill Birch, the finance minister, no difficulties this year. His forecasts of surpluses of 3.8-7.2% of GDP for 1996-98 were just the sort of thing that makes markets happy.
Nor does New Zealand's economic good news end there. The economy is humming along (growing by around 5% in 1994) fuelled by strong growth in business investment, which grew by more than 20% in the year to March 1994 and is reckoned to have grown at the same rate in the following year. Employment increased by 4.9% of the workforce in 1994. Though growth is expected to slow as the Reserve Bank puts up interest rates to restrain inflation to under 2% per year, almost all commentators see New Zealand's economy on a path of sustained expansion.
Across the Tasman Sea, Australia seems to have put behind it the recession that its prime minister, Paul Keating, said it had to have. The economy is reckoned to have grown by more than 4% in 1994. Unemployment has fallen from 11% two years ago to around 9%.
As in New Zealand, growth in Australia is expected to slow down. Interest rates are moving upwards, and early indicators such as housing starts and retail sales have dipped. While a recessionary hard landing is not expected (unless the current-account deficit billows, requiring a further increase in interest rates) Australia's fragile public finances make the risks higher than in New Zealand.
Although the two economies have much in common, the New Zealand approach is more dour, and more thorough. Labour markets have been freed, welfare eligibility restricted, and health and education tackled in an effort to provide more market-led services. Legal rules, such as those under the Fiscal Responsibility Act, constrain political opportunism. This emphasis on consistency in policy has helped lead to a healthy growth in investment.
Australia has done its share of market-led reform by international standards. But its reform has been patchier than New Zealand's. Australia's labour market remains relatively inflexible because of the government's close co-operation with the trade unions--most obvious in the inefficiency of Australia's ports.
And yet and yet. The enthusiast for Australia will mention that New Zealand has started so far behind and went through such a prolonged period of economic restructuring in the 1980s that some bounceback was inevitable. Nevertheless, the success of New Zealand is irritating to Australian politicians, and this could have an impact on relations between the two countries. In 1983 the two signed a free-trade agreement. Australia made many concessions to its smaller neighbour. But Australia feels that New Zealand has done too well from the deal.
A telling example of Australia's pique came last year when Mr Keating reneged on an understanding to create an Australia-New Zealand aviation market. He decided it might harm the privatisation of the state-owned Qantas. Underlying this was a concern that the long-privatised Air New Zealand would do too well in Australia's flabby and over-regulated market. Those Kiwi upstarts have to be kept in check.","IT MAY be difficult for Australians to swallow the idea that New Zealand 's approach to economic management is superior to theirs .

But in a by-election on March 25th, enough home buyers in the valley facing higher mortgage payments voted for the Liberal (conservative) Party candidate to give Labor a drubbing. The swing against Labor was calculated at 18%, the worst suffered by a ruling party since 1939.
The result, while it has been a blow to the prime minister, Paul Keating, is, more importantly, seen as confirmation that the Liberals have chosen well in selecting John Howard as their leader. When the by-election was called in January, after the resignation of a cabinet minister, Liberal Party officials at first thought they would not even bother to go to the expense of fielding a candidate. Party morale was low; the then party leader, Alexander Downer, was on the ropes. But since Mr Howard took over in late January, the party's fortunes seem to have improved.
In the by-election campaign, Mr Howard (who was also leader of the Liberal Party from 1985-89) has harped on one theme, the pain of the 2.75% rise in interest rates since last August, aimed at cooling the overheated economy. He finds it hard to deny the economy is doing well, but says the recovery is like ""five minutes of sunshine"" that will soon be past. Nappy Valley seemed prepared to accept his line.

WORLD culture received an unexpected boost from Australia this month. On April 10th, Australia's actors went on strike, walking off the sets of, among other productions, the soap operas that have infiltrated television broadcasts all over the world. Sadly, it was only a one-day stoppage, but a proposed series of strikes from April 26th makes further disruptions to shooting schedules seem likely. ""For some,"" hinted Anne Britton, the actors' union's joint secretary, enticingly, ""it may well mean that the episodes will not be completed.""
Australians used to hear strike threats not so much from actors, but from transport workers, miners, dockers, hospital staff or airport workers almost every week. The country had one of the rich world's worst reputations for strikes. After 12 years of reformist Labor government, the picture has changed a lot--though not quite as much as businessmen would like, or the government would have investors believe.
A year ago, the Industrial Relations Reform Act, the government's much-vaunted bid to overhaul the labour market, was passed. The legislation tries to encourage a more flexible system of bargaining between employers and unions at the workplace instead of the old practice of centrally fixed wage agreements. After a year, 56% of workers covered by federal (as opposed to state) agreements have switched to the new system.
This system is in keeping with the government's long-running accord with the unions, which is designed to moderate wage claims, and earlier legislation designed to bring about union amalgamations. Since 1989, the number of unions has been reduced from 143 to 48, of which 20 are ""super unions"". More significantly, the number of working days lost dropped from well above the rich world's average, to well below by the early 1990s. Since then, however, it has climbed back up.
In setting out to pull the teeth of the powerful trade unions, the Labor government, whose origins lie deep in the union movement, has undergone its own pain. The government has succeeded in passing some tough legislation, but has had a harder time changing attitudes towards the role of the unions in government. When Paul Keating, the prime minister, announced on April 11th an historic pact between the federal and state governments designed to end state monopolies over water, power and gas, John Coombs, the head of the maritime union, whose members closed down Australia's docks with. a strike last September, warned of ""horrendous consequences"" if the new pact went ahead without union consultations.
Australian businessmen suspect that the government is still prisoner to such threats. The Business Council of Australia and the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry argue that the Industrial Relations Reform Act has failed to provide the sweeping changes that Mr Keating promised for it after his election victory in 1993. Their main target is a stringent clause forbidding the ""unfair dismissal"" of employees. ""It's a missed opportunity for real reform, and in some respects it has one backwards,"" said Vernon Winley, assistant director of the Business Council, which represents 90 of Australia's biggest companies.
The businessmen now find they have an unlikely ally in Bob Carr, the Labor premier of New South Wales, Australia's most populous state. On April 13th, Mr Carr said he would press the government to scrap measures that make it difficult to sack workers. ""The federal provisions are a handbrake on employment growth,"" he says. Mr Keating, who faces a tough budget next month and a general election within a year, may not thank him for his frankness.","SYDNEY

This year the deficit may reach 6% of GDP. In its latest budget, delivered on May 9th, the government did its bit to set an example by tightening its own belt. Instead of producing yet another budget deficit, Ralph Willis, the treasurer, promised a surplus of A$718m ($533m).
The government's new-found fiscal prudence has meant abandoning some old promises. When Paul Keating, the prime minister, won the ""unwinnable"" election for Labor in 1993, he did so on a platform that promised tax cuts to most Australians over the following three years. This year, in the last budget before a general election due by 1996, the promised tax cuts have been deftly but resoundingly dropped.
This may seem strange when the prime minister is preparing to seek an unprecedented sixth term for Labor. But Australians have anyway been sceptical about the tax cuts. After Australia's central bank raised interest rates three times last year to keep a lid on inflation, many people have been more worried about mortgage payments.
In framing the budget, Mr Willis aimed to sustain economic growth, build national savings and attack the current-account deficit, without any rise in interest rates. The result is a budget that he says will be modestly in surplus in 1995-96. If all goes well, the hope is that that surplus will rise to A$7.4 billion, or 1.2% of GDP, by 1998-99.
Spending will be cut on the civil service, on job-creation (because unemployment has fallen to 8.3% and is predicted to fall further) and on health. The levy on medicare, the national health-insurance scheme, will go up slightly. Wage-earners will have to contribute up to 3% of their pay to pension funds by 1999. This may help Mr Keating get around the problem of the non-existent tax cuts. Instead of technically withdrawing them, the government will match workers' payments to pension funds, arguing that the tax benefits will be better spent in retirement.
If the government was expecting applause from businessmen for its fiscal prudence, it was disappointed. Industrialists were dismayed that company taxes are going up from 33% to 36%, especially since Mr Keating announced two years ago that they would be cut to Asian levels.
Mr Willis's critics also pointed out that the surplus was produced with the help of a few one-off tricks. Strip out proposed asset sales and the budget is actually in deficit by A$4.6 billion. The government intends to sell its remaining 50.4% of the Commonwealth Bank, one of Australia's four leading trading banks, to raise about A$4.5 billion. Mr Keating himself once ruled out ever selling it. ""We have changed our mind,"" said Mr Willis.
The Labor government is starting a campaign to promote the budget to the public, with a view to calling an election this year if the signs are right. Mr Keating's big advantage is that the unions, whose support is crucial to his party, have endorsed the budget and agreed to continue to moderate wage claims. That, he must hope, may be enough to secure his party's re-election.","AN EVER - EXPANDING current - account deficit is a sure sign that Australia is living beyond its means .

But the nonchalance with which Kerry Packer dismissed the recent theft of A$5.4m ($3.9m)worth of gold from a safe in his office at Consolidated Press Holdings (CPH) in Sydney was impressive in a man with a notorious temper. Or it was until you consider that the bullion represented around 0.2% of his personal wealth, about as much as he might lose during a bad day at the races. For Mr Packer, whose stated aim eight years ago was to quintuple the A$1 billion he received from Alan Bond for Australia's most successful TV-channel, Nine Network, is over halfway there.
He may be most famous outside Australia as the man who introduced multicoloured pyjamas to cricket in the 1970s, but so far the grandson of R.C. Packer and son of Sir Frank has proved an exception to two rules: that the third generation of
family business will usually mess it up; and that Australian buccaneers who live by bold deals, family feuds and political connections die by them too. Unlike Messrs Bond, Elliott, Fairfax, and Skase, Mr Packer's empire is intact-and unlike that more cerebral ambler, Rupert Murdoch, he has not had to take up American citizenship or kowtow to Asian dictators to keep it. Even his critics admit that Mr Packer has combined a not noticeably intellectual manner and a love of polo with an uncanny knack for getting the big things right: it is hard to think of anybody else who did as well out of the 1987 stockmarket crash.
But is he any kind of a model for his country's businessmen? Depending on your point of view, Mr Packer's empire is either wide-ranging or unfocused. It includes part of a chemical company, half of a firm that puts money-off coupons in newspapers, and lots of land. But what keeps Mr Packer in the headlines is his stake in mass media. CPH has a 45% stake in Publishing & Broadcasting Ltd, which owns Australia's largest magazine publisher and Nine Network, which Mr Packer bought back from a bankrupt Mr Bond for a fifth of its original price.
Mr Packer's empire has been built around a feel for price and timing, plus some useful political connections. For years his ""mates"" in Canberra, who have included both Bob Hawke and Paul Keating, smoothed his path and, in particular, blocked the development of pay-television in a form that might have threatened Nine Network. Mr Packer leaves daily management to others but still runs his empire as a private fief. When he fell out with Al Dunlap, appointed to rationalise his businesses while Mr Packer was recovering from a heart attack, Mr Dunlap's successes counted for naught and he left.
This style has worked for Mr Packer. But it has also limited his media activities to Australia. His local feel and political connections count for nothing in the rest of the world. In this he typifies Australian businesses. With the exception of BHP, a big mining conglomerate, and Mr Murdoch, they tend to be a parochial lot.
An obsession with possession
Now there are a few signs that Mr Packer's smoothly ticking machine may be about to tock. He can still pull off some agreeably laddish deals. Optus Vision, a pay-television consortium in which Mr Packer has an interest, has just snookered Mr Murdoch by beating his Foxtel consortium to the rights to Seven Network's sports coverage. Publishing & Broadcasting is expected to turn in a respectable post-tax profit of A$150m this year. But there have been a couple of apparent bungles. Mr Packer failed to bid enough to acquire his own pay-television licence when political manoeuvring could no longer keep the auction at bay. A second piece of underbidding deprived him of the licence to operate Sydney's new casino. And now Mr Murdoch is threatening Nine Network by stealing the best players of rugby league, one of the network's most popular features, for his own pay-channel.
Worst of all, Mr Packer risks losing his political goodwill with the government over what seems to be a family feud. John Fairfax, the newspaper group that publishes the Sydney Morning Herald, used to belong to the Packers' arch-rivals, the Fairfaxes, and he wants to own it. It does not seem enough for Mr Packer that the Fairfaxes lost the group in 1990 when one of their youngest scions indulged in some ill-advised financial engineering. Mr Packer wants to rub salt in the wound and hand Fairfax to his own son on a silver platter.
Under Australia's media-ownership laws, no one is allowed to ""control"" a newspaper group and a television network. Control was thought to be defined as a 15% shareholding. But Mr Packer, who owns over 17% of Fairfax, persuaded the Australian Broadcasting Authority that he did not exercise any control over the company because Conrad Black, a Canadian mogul, owned more. He even persuaded it that a 50% holding might not necessarily constitute control. Such sophistry was too much for the prime minister. On May 3rd, Mr Keating, once a Packer partisan, stepped in. The law would be changed, he said, to define 20% as ""control""--no ""ifs"", no ""buts"". By overstepping the mark Mr Packer has damaged a valuable connection, perhaps permanently.
There are a few lessons here: don't push your mates too hard; revenge is expensive. But the wider moral is that lasting global empires are not built by political fixes or an instinct for clinching deals. The history of Australian business is littered with the wreckage of failed one-man bands. The exceptions, such as Mr Murdoch, are those who have been patient, dispassionate, even scientific. These are vices that nobody has tried to pin on a man who leaves the best part of a third of a tonne of gold in his office.","SANG - FROID is not a noted Australian characteristic . But the nonchalance with which Kerry Packer dismissed the recent theft of A$ 5.4 m ( $ 3.9m)worth of gold from a safe in his office at Consolidated Press Holdings ( CPH ) in Sydney was impressive in a man with a notorious temper . Or it was until you consider that the bullion represented around 0.2 % of his personal wealth , about as much as he might lose during a bad day at the races . For Mr Packer , whose stated aim eight years ago was to quintuple the A$ 1 billion he received from Alan Bond for Australia 's most successful TV - channel , Nine Network , is over halfway there . 
 He may be most famous outside Australia as the man who introduced multicoloured pyjamas to cricket in the 1970s , but so far the grandson of R.C. Packer and son of Sir Frank has proved an exception to two rules : that the third generation of 
 family business will usually mess it up ; and that Australian buccaneers who live by bold deals , family feuds and political connections die by them too . Unlike Messrs Bond , Elliott , Fairfax , and Skase , Mr Packer 's empire is intact - and unlike that more cerebral ambler , Rupert Murdoch , he has not had to take up American citizenship or kowtow to Asian dictators to keep it . Even his critics admit that Mr Packer has combined a not noticeably intellectual manner and a love of polo with an uncanny knack for getting the big things right : it is hard to think of anybody else who did as well out of the 1987 stockmarket crash . 
 But is he any kind of a model for his country 's businessmen ? Depending on your point of view , Mr Packer 's empire is either wide - ranging or unfocused . It includes part of a chemical company , half of a firm that puts money - off coupons in newspapers , and lots of land . But what keeps Mr Packer in the headlines is his stake in mass media . CPH has a 45 % stake in Publishing & Broadcasting Ltd , which owns Australia 's largest magazine publisher and Nine Network , which Mr Packer bought back from a bankrupt Mr Bond for a fifth of its original price . 
 Mr Packer 's empire has been built around a feel for price and timing , plus some useful political connections . For years his "" mates "" in Canberra , who have included both Bob Hawke and Paul Keating , smoothed his path and , in particular , blocked the development of pay - television in a form that might have threatened Nine Network . Mr Packer leaves daily management to others but still runs his empire as a private fief . When he fell out with Al Dunlap , appointed to rationalise his businesses while Mr Packer was recovering from a heart attack , Mr Dunlap 's successes counted for naught and he left . 
 This style has worked for Mr Packer . But it has also limited his media activities to Australia . His local feel and political connections count for nothing in the rest of the world . In this he typifies Australian businesses . With the exception of BHP , a big mining conglomerate , and Mr Murdoch , they tend to be a parochial lot . 
 An obsession with possession 
 Now there are a few signs that Mr Packer 's smoothly ticking machine may be about to tock . He can still pull off some agreeably laddish deals . Optus Vision , a pay - television consortium in which Mr Packer has an interest , has just snookered Mr Murdoch by beating his Foxtel consortium to the rights to Seven Network 's sports coverage . Publishing & Broadcasting is expected to turn in a respectable post - tax profit of A$ 150 m this year . But there have been a couple of apparent bungles . Mr Packer failed to bid enough to acquire his own pay - television licence when political manoeuvring could no longer keep the auction at bay . A second piece of underbidding deprived him of the licence to operate Sydney 's new casino . And now Mr Murdoch is threatening Nine Network by stealing the best players of rugby league , one of the network 's most popular features , for his own pay - channel .

WHEN Mark Twain travelled by rail almost a century ago between Sydney and Melbourne, Australia's two biggest cities, he found himself having to change to a train of a different track gauge at the border between the states of New South Wales and Victoria. ""One or two reasons are given for this curious state of things,"" Twain wrote later. ""One is, that it represents the jealousy existing between the colonies. What the other is, I have forgotten...It could be but another effort to explain the inexplicable.""
Millions of travellers have since experienced the same frustrations brought about by a system which, until this month, made Australia one of the last rich countries whose main cities were not linked by a uniform standard-gauge railway line. Almost 150 years after Australia's first railway opened, Paul Keating, the prime minister, symbolically took the controls this month of a freight train in Melbourne bound for Perth. With its cargo of canned fruit, steel pipes and processed food, the train was the first to make the 5,400-kilometre (3,375-mile) journey from Brisbane through Sydney, Melbourne and Adelaide to Perth without changing gauges.
In contrast to America, where the railways helped to push the frontier from east to west, those that grew in Australia from the 1850s did so as separate systems in the state colonies, linking the outback with the main coastal cities. Queensland and Western Australia built narrow-gauge lines, Victoria chose Irish broad gauge and New South Wales picked British standard gauge.
The legacy meant that by 1917, a journey from Brisbane to Perth involved six nights' travel, five breaks of gauge and nine separate trains. Reform has moved at a glacial pace. Sydney and Brisbane were linked by standard-gauge track in 1930. It took another 32 years to do the same for Sydney and Melbourne. By the 1990s the only missing link was between Adelaide and Melbourne, joined since 1887 by broad gauge track.
Two years ago Mr Keating's Labor government set up the National Rail Corporation (NRC), to revive the rail system by taking responsibility for all national freight movements. The states willingly agreed: rail freight operations had been losing Australian taxpayers A$1m ($720,000) a day, as road hauliers grabbed 70% of the market.
With the help of A$429m from the government, the NRC has embarked on the biggest upgrading of the railway system Australia has seen for almost 80 years, and one of its largest public-works projects ever. The 830 kilometres of track between Adelaide and Melbourne has been converted to standard gauge; lines and bridges elsewhere across Australia have been rebuilt and straightened out. More than 3,000 jobs were created for the work and A$1 billion has been earmarked for further investment.
The NRC promises to cut eight hours off a typical journey from Melbourne to Perth with its restored network, and aims to take business away from roads by building rail's share of freight from one-third now to a half. The corporation has already turned its first small profit, and some of Australia's biggest companies have promised to turn increasingly to rail.","SYDNEY

According to a pro-government French daily newspaper, Le Figaro, he has a ""fetishist hatred"" of the country. In reality, he probably admires the French, to judge from his collection of French clocks. But in the quarrel over France's decision to resume the testing of nuclear weapons in its Pacific island of Mururoa in September, normal discourse between the two countries has been replaced by venom.
The Figaro's editor, Franz-Olivier Giesbert, an ally of the French president, Jacques Chirac, said Australia was attacking France over the tests to salve its conscience about the ""ethnic cleansing"" of aborigines. Mr Keating's spokesman found the accusation ""offensive"". As it was, but no more so than an open letter to Mr Chirac from a church in Tahiti, in French Polynesia, that compared the tests to the deportation of French Jews in the second world war.
At a more sober level, New Zealand said on August 8th that it would seek an interim order at the International Court of Justice in the Hague to stop France from going ahead with the underground tests. Australia said it would support this challenge, although earlier it had said the action had little chance of success. Both countries launched actions against France at the court in 1973, when the French were conducting tests in the atmosphere at Mururoa. Those cases never moved to a conclusion, because Paris announced during the proceedings that from 1975 it would do its testing underground.
Technically, New Zealand appears to be in a better position than Australia to revive its 1973 case, which covered nuclear contamination generally. Australia's action dealt specifically with atmospheric tests. Even so, Jim Bolger, New Zealand's prime minister, admits that his country's case is not a strong one. Strong or not, France said in 1974 that it would not recognise the international court's authority in the issue. New Zealand, though, is happy to take a stand, in line with its general anti-nuclear policy. In the 1980s it upset America by banning visits by nuclear-armed ships.
Trade and business ties between France and Australia have managed to survive the nuclear quarrel, but only just. An estimated 40,000 jobs in Australia are directly linked to trade in French goods and products. The Australian government has stood back from imposing economic sanctions and boycotts which could hurt Australians more than the French. But when the government barred a French company, Dassault, from bidding for a contract to supply jet trainers to the Australian air force, France said it would reconsider its imports of Australian coal and uranium.
Even though the uranium consignments to France are earmarked solely for electricity generation, they are causing Mr Keating's Labor Party government considerable embarrassment. The party's left win and the Australian Council of Trade Unions have called for a halt to the exports. If that happened, France might even be pleased. Australia has a contract worth almost A$80m ($60m) to supply uranium to France up to 2001. At present spot prices, France could replace its Australian supplies for half the cost.","DOES Paul Keating hate France ?

Thousands of rioters torched buildings at Tahiti's main airport and attacked the residence of the French High Commissioner. Australia's prime minister Paul Keating called the test an ""act of stupidity"". New Zealand and Chile withdrew their ambassadors from Paris, Japan protested, Germany quietly expressed regret and America urged France to refrain from further tests. Jacques Chirac, the French president, cancelled a planned visit to Japan and sent troops to Tahiti to quell the riots.
The United Nations women's conference opened in Beijing. Hillary Clinton condemned forced sterilisations and abortions, to the cheers of delegates who understood that she was implicitly attacking the Chinese government. China was annoyed.
Fidel Ramos, the president of the Philippines, said he would definitely step down when his term ends in 1998. He was responding to rumours that the government plans to rewrite the constitution, to let him run for a second term.
South Korea's veteran opposition politician, Kim Dae Jung, founded a new political party, the National Congress for New Politics. It will be the largest opposition group in parliament.
Force and diplomacy
NATO suspended its bombing campaign against the Bosnian Serbs, to give them a chance to withdraw their heavy weapons from Sarajevo, but renewed it on September 5th when they did not. America's diplomatic initiative continued as the presidents of Serbia, Croatia and Bosnia agreed to meet for talks in Geneva on September 8th.
Continuing Russia's party-political manoeuvres, Yuri Boldyrev resigned from Yabloko, the second-largest reformist party, which he had helped to found. The prime minister's party, Our Home is Russia, held a special Congress to unveil its party list.
Russia postponed the election that had been due to take place in Chechnya on November 5th.
The German government put forward a planned budget which would cut the amount of new debt required for the first time since 1953. The SPD vowed to stop the bill.
Cyrus Vance, a special United Nations mediator, said that Macedonia and Greece had settled all their disputes about the former Yugoslav republic, except the name of the country (which to the Greeks implies territorial claims).
Michal Kovac, the son of the Slovak president, was reportedly kidnapped, beaten, forced to drink whisky at gunpoint and then dumped in Austria. Austrian police treated his injuries--then imprisoned him on charges of fraud at the behest of the German police.
Labour of Congress
The United States Congress reassembled. It is due to complete legislation on welfare, regulation, telecoms, crime and the line-item veto, while also reaching agreement on a balanced budget by October 1st. The government was also expected to reach its credit limit (the ""debt ceiling"") some time in October.
In speeches in Indianapolis and Chicago, Bob Dole, the Republican front-runner, attacked multiculturalism, appealed for the abolition of bilingual education in schools and endorsed ""lower and flatter"" tax rates.
The Senate Ethics Committee voted unanimously to recommend the expulsion of Bob Packwood, a Republican, for sexual and official misconduct. The decision must be approved by two-thirds of the Senate. The senator said the process made the Inquisition look like ""a study in fairness"".
Cuba's parliament passed a law to allow foreign ownership in nearly all parts of the economy. Its symbolic value is likely to be greater than its practical effects.

Some of Mr Chirac's supporters have dismissed such protests, along with calls by environmental groups for a boycott of French goods, as a foreign conspiracy.

According to the latest issue of Strategic Comments, published by the London-based International Institute for Strategic Studies, the test series will serve three purposes. One test will complete the development of the TN-75 warhead for use on submarine-launched ballistic missiles; two will verify the safety of the triggers in older warheads; and four will be designed to help develop the computer-simulation techniques needed to ensure the reliability of France's nuclear deterrent once a test ban comes into force. France is less advanced in such techniques than either America or Britain. Despite this, Mr Chirac has promised that, if enough useful information can be gleaned from the early tests, the series will be curtailed.
That will not please his nuclear planners. France, like Britain, Russia and some in the Pentagon, had originally been assuming that a future test ban would still leave a margin for smallish tests, up to a few hundred tonnes of explosive power (for safety checks, say the testers; For developing new nuclear warheads, say their critics). On August 10th, however, in the hope of blunting the mounting opposition to its test plans, France announced in Geneva that it would forgo these. It would now accept an Australian proposal to ""prohibit any nuclear weapon test explosion or any other nuclear explosion"". Even under this formula, France would still have been able to conduct hydro-nuclear tests (which produce a few pounds of explosive yield).
The following day, however, President Clinton cooked Mr Chirac's goose by announcing that America was prepared to forego even these sorts of tests, committing itself to a ""true zero"" test-ban. A few days later an embarrassed France appeared to follow suit. Thus, according to Rebecca Johnson from Acronym, a consortium of non-governmental groups monitoring the talks in Geneva, France's attempts to offset criticism of its test plans have ended up pushing it much further than it had originally intended in accepting stringent limits on its future nuclear activities. As a result, there have been muffled booms from inside France's nuclear establishment too, which wants more tests before next year's ban, not fewer. Not even Mr Chirac would attempt that.

There were, after all, clues to be had, notably the country's whopping current-account deficit. So which emerging economy is the next Mexico? Here's one candidate. Its inflation has risen fivefold over the past three years, its current-account deficit is 6% of GDP, and--after external deficits in 28 of the past 30 years--its net foreign debt stands at a horrid 40% of GDP.
Funnily enough this is Australia, sometimes known as the ""lucky country"", whose present stroke of fortune is to combine a third-world economy with a first-world standard of living. But its luck may be running out. Its headline inflation rate rose to 5.1% in September, the highest for five years. The underlying rate has also risen, to 3.1%, breaching the Reserve Bank's target. This is hardly hyperinflation. But, at a time when inflation is supposedly dead in rich economies, it is worrying, and a warning against complacency elsewhere.
Then there is that current-account deficit. Although it has narrowed slightly in recent months, it will this year be twice as large as a proportion of GDP as the deficit of any other OECD economy. Is that a problem? Australian politicians are fond of stressing that their country is part of Asia, and it is true that some successful Asian countries, such as Malaysia and Thailand, have current-account deficits of 6% or more of GDP. Such a deficit does not, by itself, have to be a sin of impending disaster. In one sense a current-account deficit is merely the necessary obverse of a capital-account surplus; it may simply reflect a country's ability to attract foreign investment.
Sometimes, however, a current-account deficit is malign. It should be judged by its causes, and by the manner of its financing. Does a widening deficit reflect increased domestic investment which boosts the productive capacity of the economy, or merely increased consumption and hence less saving? Is it financed by long-term capital--foreigners building factories, for example--or by short-term investment in equities and bonds, which can stampede out of a country as quickly as it bares in?
Whereas Mexico failed on both tests, Asia's emerging economies have generally been bigger savers and better able to attract long-term investment (though, see page 39, some alarm bells are starting to ring in Asia, too). The trouble is that Australia is not as Asian as that. The causes of its current-account deficit are bad. In Australia's case the deficit, in combination with rising inflation, signals an overheating economy, and--on a deeper level--a persistent failure to save. Household savings have slumped from 10% of disposable income in 1980 to 3% this year--one of the lowest savings rates in the OECD.
Does all this add up to an Antipodean Mexico? That would be scaremongering: the Australian dollar has held up fairly well over the past year. But Australia's excessive reliance on foreign capital leaves the currency and long-term interest rates vulnerable. A weaker currency would push up the cost of servicing its foreign debts. So unless the lucky country becomes a thrifty country, it will be in big trouble. Its policy-makers should be seeking in the short term to tighten monetary policy in order to reduce domestic demand, and in the loner term to increase savings, either by running a budget surplus or by giving the private sector new incentives to save.
So far, the government has done too little. A budget last May planned a shift into surplus in the year to June 1996, but intends to achieve this largely through big asset sales and other contrivances. The government also has plans to promote savings through compulsory employee contributions to pension funds, but much more is needed. Best of all would be a reform of the tax system to shift the burden away from income tax, which discourages savings, to taxes on spending. Australia raises more of its total taxes from income and profits and less from consumption than almost any other OECD economy.
Tie me economy down, sport
Raise interest rates and taxes? Paul Keating, now prime minister with an election due by May, can hardly welcome such advice. But May 1996 will also be the tenth anniversary of his famous speech as finance minister, when he warned his countrymen that without a proper economic policy Australia could end up as a banana republic. It still could.","EVER since Mexico 's peso hit a spot of bother at the end of last year , pundits and investors have been kicking themselves for having failed to spot the trouble in advance .

And nothing provokes more contortions than the delicate issue of Indonesia's occupation of East Timor. This former Portuguese colony is closer to Australia than to Indonesia's capital, Jakarta.
If Australia wants to be accepted as part of Asia it must get on with Indonesia. The government of Paul Keating has laboured to dispel the traditional Australian fear of ""invasion from the north"", and to create less threatening images of its neighbour. Gareth Evans, Australia's foreign minister, likes to play chummy games of golf with Ali Alatas, his Indonesian counterpart. Mr Keating has tried to strike up a friendship with Indonesia's forbidding president, Suharto. Indonesia, Messrs Keating and Evans often point out, is Australia's second-largest market in South-East Asia.
But most Australians remain sceptical. Human rights--and particularly the treatment of the people of East Timor--lies at the heart of the problem.
It is probable that over 100,000 people died in the Indonesian invasion of East Timor in 1975, and in subsequent pacification operations. The Australian government, often outspoken about human rights in faraway places, has been almost mute on East Timor. Australia is the only western country that recognises Indonesian sovereignty over the territory. The United Nations still recognises Portuguese jurisdiction,
Yet the Australian public seems to care about East Timor. As a result, Australian diplomacy keeps tripping over domestic opinion. In recent months the government has suffered three embarrassments.
The first came in July, after the Indonesians announced that their new ambassador to Canberra would be Herman Mantiri, a general who had publicly justified the 1991 massacre by Indonesian troops of protesters in the East Timorese capital, Dili. Such was the public outcry in Australia over the appointment that Indonesia eventually withdrew it. The post is still unfilled.
Keen to regain favour in Jakarta, Mr Keating's government announced last month that it would refuse asylum to refugees from East Timor. Eighteen arrived in the port of Darwin by boat in May and a further 1,300 have since come in on tourist visas. Technically, Australia argued, the Timorese were still Portuguese citizens and, under the UN definition of refugees, should turn to Portugal first.
This sits oddly with Australia's arguments before the International Court of Justice in a case which Portugal brought against it over the Timor Gap Treaty, an agreement between Australia and Indonesia to carve up the Timor Sea's vast oil reserves. Australia told the court that Portugal had ""abandoned"" East Timor in 1975 and no longer held legal responsibility for the territory, given the ""modern-day reality"" of Indonesia's presence. (In June, the court dismissed Portugal's application on the round that it could not determine the case in the absence of Indonesia, which does not recognise the court's jurisdiction.) To Mr Keating's critics, the decision to reject Timorese refugees seems hypocritical.
Now the ghosts of five journalists, killed in East Timor 20 years ago, have come back to haunt the Australian government. The Indonesians have always claimed that the five--who included two Australians--were killed in fighting between Timorese factions, well before the Indonesians invaded. Relations of the journalists have argued that they were murdered by Indonesian troops, who wanted to eliminate eye-witnesses to their intervention.
On the eve of the 20th anniversary of their deaths, Australian newspapers published a statement by Guilherme Goncalves, a former Indonesian-appointed governor of East Timor, claiming that Indonesia's version of events was invented to appease Australia. Mr Goncalves was himself a signatory to a letter handed to Australian diplomats at the time, purporting to explain what had happened to the journalists.
Australia has never formally protested to Indonesia about the deaths. Shirley Shackleton, widow of Greg Shackleton, one of the Australian journalists, has been a vocal critic of Australia's handling of the affair. ""The Indonesians got away with murder 20 years ago and the Australian government helped them,"" she told a gathering to mark the anniversary.

His Labor Party had secured an unprecedented fifth term in office. If the opposition Liberal-National coalition could not beat an unpopular government that had presided over a two-year recession, the argument went, there was little hope for it.
Such certainties have long faded. Mr Keating has been trailing in the polls for most of the year and is expected to call an election by next March. In anticipation of renewed electoral combat, his language, never noted for its restraint, has become even rougher at the edges. The prime minister has accused John Howard, the leader of the opposition, of wanting to pursue racist policies. The opposition has accused Mr Keating of desperation.
Underlying Mr Keating's problems is a resurgence of some old economic demons. Having got out of recession and into a period of low inflation before most of the rich world, Australia is now seeing prices rise again. Consumer prices are rising at an annual rate of 5.1%, the highest for five years.
Underlying inflation has hit 3.1%, breaking the target of 2-3% set by the central bank. The latest figures also show unemployment starting to rise again, to 8.7%.
A recent report from the Bureau of Industry Economics, a government body, has also undermined the government's claim that 12 years of deregulation and labourmarket reform have transformed Australia. The report compared Australian energy, transport and related industries with those of foreign competitors. It found that Australia approached best practice in only two: road freight and coal handling at ports. In aviation and waterfront container-handling, it has actually become less efficient, while the rest of the world has moved ahead. Australia's docks are among the slowest to move containers, which often hang around for more than 40 hours before being shifted.
This is not the sort of news that Mr Keating will relish having thrown at him in the coming campaign. But the prime minister is Australia's most formidable politician and has a knack for finding his opponent's weak spot and attacking it. He secured his apparently miraculous victory in 1993 by turning the election into a scare campaign against the opposition's proposed consumption tax. This time he is likely to try to do the same thing with its industrial-relations policy.
Under Labor's eight ""accords"" with the unions, strikes had almost disappeared.
They recently broke out again on a grand scale in the states of Western Australia and Victoria, in protest at tough measures which new Liberal state governments have introduced to curb union power. Mr Keating claims these are harbingers of the industrial chaos on a national scale that he says would follow if a Liberal-National coalition won the federal election.
An opinion poll taken last month showed that the coalition's lead over Labor had narrowed from ten points to four. Mr Keating had overtaken Mr Howard as the preferred prime minister by five points. The poll was published as Mr Keating flew off to the Commonwealth heads-of-government meeting in New Zealand, where he planned to indulge in some electioneering by proxy: pom-bashing aimed at John Major over his support for France's nuclear tests in the Pacific.

But the worst outbreak of industrial unrest in more than a decade has shaken that claim.
The trouble started in Weipa, in remote northern Queensland, with a blockade by workers employed at a bauxite mine run by Conzinc Rio Tinto (CRA), Australia's fourthlargest company. The Weipa strike revolved around the question of the right of workers to sign individual contracts with their employers. The company had persuaded about 90% of its Weipa workforce to take up such contracts, by offering incentives which allowed contract workers to earn an average of A$7,000 ($5,185) a year more than the 75 employees who stayed with union-negotiated pay awards.
CRA claimed it wanted to end the old divide between blue- and white-collar workers and to give all its employees a direct interest in the company's prosperity. The 75 responded that the company really wanted to get rid of all unions. They launched their strike a month ago demanding that they should be paid the same rate as non-union employees doing the same sort of work.
Their case was seized upon by the Australian Council of Trade Unions (ACTU). Bill Kelty, its secretary, described the striking Weipa workers as ""heroes"" and compared them to the Tolpuddle martyrs, six English farm labourers who were transported to Australia in 1834 for forming a trade union. When CRA sued the union for damages, the ACTU took over the strike and turned it into a national campaign by calling out workers in ports and coal mines, and threatening to do the same in the transport, power and chemical industries. ""For us to be beaten is for the union movement to lose its heart, its soul and its purpose,"" asserted Mr Kelty.
In reality, the ACTU is making a last stand to hold on to union power and the old collectivebargaining system, in the face of the changes sweeping through industry. Many of these changes result from the Labor government's economic reforms, which were designed to make Australian industry more competitive. A series of accords with the unions to moderate wage claims--and legislation to bring about union amalgamations--were followed last year by a law opening the way to flexible bargaining in the workplace. Union membership in the private sector has fallen from half the workforce 20 years ago to a quarter today. Alarmed by this, the ACTU has recently embarked on a campaign to recruit 200,000 new members, especially in the booming service and tourism industries, some of which were born without unions.
The latest strikes were a reminder of how much damage Australian unions can still inflict. Before the dispute reached the Industrial Relations Commission, Australia's arbitration tribunal, the strikes had cost the economy about A$300m. The ACTU chose as its advocate Bob Hawke, the former Labor prime minister, who first made his mark in a similar role for the union movement 25 years ago. The commission ruled on November 21st that CRA must pay its striking workers more money, and that companies should not discriminate against those who elect to stay with union-negotiated contracts.
It is not clear where all this leaves Paul Keating, Mr Hawke's successor as prime minister. Having failed to stop the strikes before he left for the Asia-Pacific Economic Co-operation summit in Japan, Mr Keating was not amused by his old Labor adversary stealing the thunder in his absence. ""Marcel Marceau could win this case for the unions,"" he said from Osaka. If the unions take their victory as a signal for further industrial campaigns, it may require more than a mime act to save Mr Keating's political fortunes. An election is due early next year, and industrial peace was to have been central to his campaign.","AFTER 12 years in power , Australia 's Labor government is fond of boasting that it has brought an end to the bad old days , when the country 's economy was a hostage to unions .

Not so long ago, Australia's generals fretted most about an invasion by their giant neighbour to the north-Indonesia. So the signature on December l8th of a security agreement with the Indonesians was understandably greeted with words like ""historic"", ""watershed"" and ""bombshell"".
This last metaphor is a tribute not just to the agreement's military significance, but also to the secrecy of 18 months of negotiation. An announcement on December 14th left even officials of the Association of South-East Asian Nations (ASEAN), of which Indonesia is a member, shellshocked. In Bangkok for an ASEAN summit meeting, some felt that Indonesia's President Suharto should not have orchestrated such resounding noises off. Mr Suharto's officials insist the agreement is not a pact, treaty or alliance. It is called, blandly enough, an ""agreement on maintaining security"", and merely commits the two countries ""to consult each other in the case of adverse challenges"". However, few defence pacts, treaties or alliances do more than that. Indonesia's belittling of the accord seems designed to spare ASEAN'S blushes, and to preserve Indonesia's cherished self-image as a leading ""non-aligned"" country.
Australia is one of the few countries to recognise Indonesian sovereignty over East Timor, but by no means an obvious partner for which to forsake non-alignment. Relations are frequently soured by rows over human rights, and by Australian press reporting of Indonesian politics and business (and the murky links between the two). East Timor, the territory annexed by Indonesia in 1975, also remains a problem; indeed protests by some Australians delayed the appointment of a new Indonesian ambassador to Canberra this year.
Despite such rows, Xanana Gusmao, the jailed East Timorese resistance leader, recently called the Australian government ""without principles"". Mr Suharto seems to agree--or at least to believe that humanrights concerns will not hamper security cooperation with Australia as they have with the United States, which in 1992 curtailed a military-training programme for Indonesia. Since then, Australia has been able to capitalise on Indonesia's worries about over-reliance on American military knowhow, by advertising its own technological capabilities. Visiting Australia earlier this year, B.J. Habibie, the Indonesian technology minister, was impressed by the hightech whizz-bangery available.
For Australia, the agreement is part of a consistent drive to enmesh itself in Asia. It has eagerly taken part in every multilateral talking-shop going, from the ASEAN Regional Forum to the Asia-Pacific Economic Co-operation forum. But that does not preclude its participation in more formal security arrangements. Through the remnants of what was, until New Zealand withdrew, the ANZUS alliance, Australia has America as an ally. It also has an agreement with Papua New Guinea, and is part of the Five-Power Defence Arrangements with Britain, New Zealand, Singapore and Malaysia. Paul Keating, the Australian prime minister, is due in Singapore and Kuala Lumpur in January, where a reaffirmation of the fivepower ties is expected.
As it happens, the five-power club was formed to guarantee Malaysian and Singaporean security after the period of ""confrontation"" with Indonesia in the 1960s. That helps explain the reaction in Australia to the new agreement. The Indonesian threat is a living memory. It is only 30 years since Australian soldiers fought Indonesians in Kalimantan (Indonesia's slice of Borneo, an island it shares with Malaysia and Brunei). As recently as 1987, an Australian defence white paper discreetly indicated Indonesia as the most serious security menace facing the country. And these days Australia's military superiority over Indonesia can no longer be assumed.
Under Mr Suharto, Indonesia has in fact been stable and inward-looking. The presidential succession, however, is not settled. Alan Dupont, of Australia's Strategic and Defence Studies Centre, suggests Australia wants ""to lock Indonesia in"" now, to minimise the risk of a volatile future. That might help Australia to keep defence spending low.
But if Australian war games are no longer to be conducted against imaginary Indonesians, against whom will they be played? Perhaps against imaginary Chinese. Both sides insist this is not an ""antiChina"" agreement. But Mr Keating pointed out last year that ""the defining element"" in Indonesian (and Vietnamese) security policy, is ""their suspicion towards China"". He said it was not a ""primary object"" of Australian policy to set up a ""non-China block"", but of course Australia did not want ""to be in the Chinese orbit"". Similarly, in listing possible ""adverse challenges"", Ali Alatas, the Indonesian foreign minister, mentioned China's dispute with Taiwan, and ""an uncontrolled escalation in the South China Sea"", where China contests sovereignty with a number of countries.
ASEAN set up its regional forum partly to manage such risks. But, precisely because the forum includes China, which prefers a bilateral, divide-and-rule approach, it may never progress from talking-shop to security arrangement. For both Australia and Indonesia, multilateral chat has less to offer than bilateral commitments.","  EVEN in peacetime , defence strategists have to plan for the most likely war , however fanciful it may seem .

His foreign minister, Gareth Evans, was similarly afflicted. He even produced a map showing Australia at the centre of East Asia. But, during a visit to Malaysia and Singapore from January 15th to the 17th, Mr Keating faced reality.
Malaysia's prime minister, Mahathir Mohamad, calls a spade a spade and a digger a digger. He has spoken of Australians as the descendants of ""ex-convicts and social discards"". Australia's Asian problem, he said in December, was not geographic, but racial. Only when 70% of Australians were ethnic Asians could the country consider itself part of Asia. Dr Mahathir, in effect, said Australians should look not at a map, but in the mirror. Fortunately, Mr Keating had got the message before arriving in Kuala Lumpur to patch up his differences with Dr Mahathir. He denied ever having wanted to see his country described as Asian, merely to see it ""integrated"" with the ""region where Australia's future lies"".
Malaysia has been among the biggest obstacles to such integration. At issue have been two different visions of Asian regionalism. Australia favours an ""open"" regionalism, partly because it would be included, and partly because it dreamt up the Asia Pacific Economic Co-operation forum, open regionalism's most significant expression. APEC'S 18 members include North American and Australasian as well as Asian countries. One of the fiercest of several MahathirKeating tiffs was over Dr Mahathir's refusal to attend the first APEC summit in 1993.
Malaysia has promoted a more limited grouping, made up of itself and the six other members of the Association of South-East Asian Nations, ASEAN, plus China, Japan and South Korea. Dr Mahathir has not yet won support for formalising this as the ""East Asian Economic Caucus"". But he has managed to block Australia's attempt to join the same ten Asian countries at the first Asia-Europe summit, to be held in Bangkok in March. So, to Dr Mahathir's satisfaction, his ""caucus without the Caucasians"" is at least taking on an informal life.
Now that Mr Keating seems to know Australia's place, Dr Mahathir can be affable. The Australians spoke of the two men's rapport this week. They stressed not the political differences, but the thriving cultural, economic and even military relations. Some 10,000 Malaysians are studying in Australia. Bilateral trade is growing at 20% a year, and Malaysia is about to overtake Britain as the tenth-largest market for Australian exports.
As members of the Five-Power Defence Arrangement, Malaysia and Australia have a military link. An Australian company, Transfield, is among the front-runners for a $1.5 billion contract for patrol boats for Malaysia's navy. Australian defence technology seems to have impressed Malaysia, as it has Indonesia, which signed a security agreement with Australia in December.
Mr Keating and Dr Mahathir parted, if not close friends, then at least not antagonists. In Singapore, though, Mr Keating received a far less cautious welcome, and was able to issue a declaration with his hosts on their shared strategic vision. Singapore seems to realise that Asia is already a bewildering ethnic, cultural and economic mix. To exclude Australia because most of its people are of European descent is to forget that Asia itself is a creation of western cartographers.","For some time , Paul Keating suffered from an embarrassing delusion : that Paul Keating was Asian .

Many of them, women in particular, say they are turned off by his tirades against his opponents: ""pansies"", ""scumbags"", ""perfumed gigolos"" and ""unrepresentative swill"" are some of his choicer descriptions. The opinion polls suggest that many Australians regard their prime minister as untrustworthy. But they also show that Mr Keating is considered a strong leader. By contrast, John Howard, the opposition leader, is seen as honest but soft. Overall, though the Labor Party is trailing in the polls, Mr Keating is preferred as prime minister.
Such personality judgments could be crucial as Australia prepares for a general election on March 2nd, particularly since the campaign seems to be strangely free of divisive issues. Few voters are able to name any real policy differences between the two sides. At the start of the campaign, the opposition Liberal-National coalition offered only two: a stronger approach than Labor towards reducing union power and a commitment to selling one-third of Telstra, the state-owned telecoms company.
Potentially controversial constitutional issues have so far not featured much in the campaign, even though Mr Keating has promised to hold a referendum by 2000 to let Australians decide whether to cut their links with the British Crown and declare their country a republic. Nor is economic policy much of an issue. Labor has held power since 1983, during which time it has shed most of its old dogma about public ownership and state intervention, and implemented free-market policies more usually associated with conservatives.
Unless Australian voters turn out to feel strongly about privatising the telephone system, the decisive issues will be the party leaders' personalities and the state of the economy. The first thing Mr Keating did after saying he would go to the country was to shrug off the polls that put Labor behindespecially the one that had the party trailing by 12 points.
This might be dismissed as mere bravado, were it not for the fact that Mr Keating has snatched victory from the jaws of defeat before. In 1993, with almost every opinion poll and political commentator predicting his defeat in an ""unwinnable election"", Mr Keating led Labor to a fifth successive victory with an increased majority. The psephologists and journalists are being notably cautious this time.
If anything, the economic background looks more favourable than it did last time. In 1993, Australia was emerging from a recession which many voters blamed on Mr Keating: his previous job before taking over as prime minister in 1991 had been as treasurer (finance minister). Unemployment was 11.3%. It has since fallen to around 8%, although youth unemployment is more than three times that in some places.
The recovery has been much as the government would have hoped for in an election year. The economy is growing at about 3.5% and inflation, after shooting above 5% late last year, has eased again. The main embarrassment remains Australia's current-account deficit, which, at 4.5% of GDP, is one of the biggest among rich countries. But Mr Keating received unexpected good news on this front during the campaign's first week. The current-account deficit in December, widely predicted to be A$2 billion ($1.48 billion) after a surge in imports, was announced to be only A$1.6 billion, thanks to an unexpected boost in exports. Campaigning in Bendigo, in Victoria, where the jobless rate is now above 12%, Mr Keating proclaimed that Australia was ""getting on top of the deficit problem"".
In the absence of any dramatic scandal or instances of Labor incompetence, the election is now likely to turn on a test of leadership between Mr Keating and Mr Howard. Here the Liberal Party, the senior partner in the opposition coalition, seems to be at a disadvantage.
The party has been shell-shocked by its repeated electoral drubbings. Mr Howard is its third leader since the 1993 election. He was treasurer for five years in the Liberal government that lost to Labor in 1983. Many remember that administration as one marked by chronic confrontation with the unions, when Australia was repeatedly crippled by strikes. Mr Howard had an earlier stint as Liberal leader during the 1980s, but the party dumped him after he lost the 1987 election. It turned to him again last year, almost in desperation, after it had exhausted a roll-call of other failed leaders.
Despite his government's unfavourable opinion polls, Mr Keating will be hoping to make up ground by wooing the voters with his dubious charms. The winner will probably be decided on the nation's television screens, where the leaders are due to confront each other in two prime-time debates. Mr Keating, no doubt, will be carefully watching his language.","THE voters of Australia may not much like Paul Keating's , but they seem to respect Paul Keating . Many of them , women in particular , say they are turned off by Paul Keating's tirades against Paul Keating's opponents : "" pansies "" , "" scumbags "" , "" perfumed gigolos "" and "" unrepresentative swill "" are some of Paul Keating's choicer descriptions . The opinion polls suggest that many Australians regard Paul Keating's as untrustworthy . But they also show that Paul Keating is considered a strong leader . By contrast , John Howard , the opposition leader , is seen as honest but soft . Overall , though the Labor Party is trailing in the polls , Paul Keating is preferred as prime minister . 
 Such personality judgments could be crucial as Australia prepares for a general election on March 2nd , particularly since the campaign seems to be strangely free of divisive issues . Few voters are able to name any real policy differences between the two sides . At the start of the campaign , the opposition Liberal - National coalition offered only two : a stronger approach than Labor towards reducing union power and a commitment to selling one - third of Telstra , the state - owned telecoms company . 
 Potentially controversial constitutional issues have so far not featured much in the campaign , even though Paul Keating has promised to hold a referendum by 2000 to let Australians decide whether to cut their links with the British Crown and declare their country a republic . Nor is economic policy much of an issue . Labor has held power since 1983 , during which time it has shed most of its old dogma about public ownership and state intervention , and implemented free - market policies more usually associated with conservatives .

AUSTRALIANS are suspicious of their rulers. When asked to approve parliamentary amendments to the constitution, as by law they must be approved, the voters have historically rejected four proposals out of five. One proposed change, however, has an air of inevitability about it: the junking of the monarchy. If the front-runners in the current election campaign, the (conservative) Liberal-National coalition, scrape home on March 2nd, the Republic of Oz may be postponed for a while. But if Labor wins-and it seems to be catching up-the British queen's latest representative in Australia, sworn in earlier this month, is likely to be her last.
Little else will change. Australians already seem to be about as republican as you can get. No people, except perhaps the Israelis, are less formal, none less deferential. Apart from a bit of stuffiness in Melbourne and an occasional whiff of racism in Queensland, the deep north, Australia is close to being a classless society, where ""mateship"" is valued above all.
The monarchy, therefore, has always seemed a bit inappropriate. It has owed its place to history the country was settled by the British-and to Australians' happy-go-lucky conservatism. The Brits gave the Aussies their institutions and the Aussies, interested only in enjoying life, hung on to them, baubles and all. Besides, ill at ease with its Asian neighbours, Australia found the British connection reassuring.
Britain, however, is 10,000 miles away. In the second world war Australia had to look to America for its security. A decade later Britain began to interest itself in Europe and in due course Australia began to accept Asian and other immigrants. Many older Australians still have an affection for the British link, but to younger ones it seems an anachronism. The increasing number of Australians who are not of British descent want their head of state to be clearly Australian.
And no doubt he will be, in time. It would be a relatively simple matter to substitute a directly elected non-executive president for the existing governor-general and to make similar arrangements for the governors of the six states. Life would then go on much as before: for years these posts have all been, in reality, Australian appointments filled byAustralians.
Republicans argue that the change would do something to strengthen Australians' sense of identity. It might also, however, point up the nature of that identity. The tradition of gallantry, as exhibited at Gallipoli in 1915, is fine, even if Anzac day, the great national holiday, thus celebrates a defeat. But it is hard to find much that is noble in Australia's earlier history. Unlike the United States, a nation founded on an idealistic set of principles, Australia was established as a dumping-ground for criminals.
The governmental cringe '
More troubling is the political philosophy underlying Australian society. Whereas the United States is the product of an 18th-century reverence for liberty and protest-values derived from Locke, Montesquieu and Rousseau-Australia is a predominantly 19th-century creation inspired by a Benthamite belief in utilitarianism and government. Americans and Australians alike believe strongly in equality and the rule of law. But, whereas Americans are interested chiefly in equality of opportunity, Australians expect equality of outcome and look unerringly to government to provide it.
This helps to explain why neither of the main parties is offering less government: the conservatives offer implausible giveaways, Labor (in office for 13 years) the comfort of continuity; privatisation is used by both to scare the voters. Yet, as the republic approaches, Australians may start to worry that their model may not, in the end, deliver the goods. Relative to its Asian neighbours, Australia is growing less prosperous. Ten years ago Paul Keating, now prime minister for Labor, warned Australians they might be heading for a banana republic.

SOMETIMES it pays to be dull. John Howard, whose conservative coalition swept to power in Australia on March 2nd, is not an exciting man. His campaign-bland, boring and largely issue-free-matched his personality. It paid off nicely. Australians have had enough of interesting politics, at least if that means the arrogance and abrasiveness of the outgoing prime minister, Paul Keating. Yet Mr Howard now has to govern. Having offered so little that was controversial in the campaign, he may find the voters unprepared for the excitements that he ought soon to be presenting to them.
Admittedly, Mr Keating's Labor Party has left Australia in a better state than it was in when Labor took over from the Liberal-National coalition in 1983. The coalition, with Mr Howard as treasurer (finance minister), had presided over seven years of inaction. Labor can take credit for tackling many long-neglected issues. It deregulated the financial markets. It reformed the social-security system. It turned Australia from one of the world's most protected countries into one of the most open: the effective rate of protection, which was 34% in the late 1960s and 24% in the mid-1970s, will soon be down to 5%. And it brought inflation down from an average annual rate of 9% in 1970-90 to 21% in 1991-96.
After a High Court ruling in 1991 threw the question of aboriginal land rights into confusion, Labor set about the task of ending the legal fiction that Australia had been an unoccupied territory when Europeans first arrived. And, perhaps most significant of all, Labor, which in the 1950s had been steadfastly behind the white-Australia policy, started to look to Asia both for trade and for immigrants. Today some 60% of Australia's trade is with Asia, and 22% of its people have no British forebears (though not all are Asian). By making overtures first to China, then to other Asian countries-Mr Keating was a promoter both of the Asia-Pacific Economic Co-operation forum and, last year, of a security treaty with IndonesiaLabor has recognised geographical reality: Australia is not a part of Europe and, in the event of the world's division into trading blocks, it would be a part of Asia or of nowhere.
Still Ozzified
In three areas, however, Labor has failed to finish the task, and in one it has not even started. First, though it has done more to privatise either than its predecessor or than most of the state governments that own the bulk of Australia's public-sector enterprises, it has balked at selling Telstra, the telecoms company. Second, it has failed to get Australians to increase savings, without which they are doomed to have a large foreign debt and habitual current-account deficits. Moreover, though the state governments are now running genuine budget surpluses, the federal government is not; it achieves the appearance of balance only through asset sales. And the rising compulsory contributions to pension funds that will eventually oblige Australians to save more will not produce significant benefits for several years yet. Third, Labor's ties to the unions have prevented it carrying out the labour-market reforms that Mr Keating promised in 1993 and that remain essential if Australian companies are to compete abroad.
Perhaps Labor's most serious omission is its refusal to reform taxes. Australians are, overall, lightly taxed, but the burden is ill distributed. With no VAT, there is no disincentive to spend, and too much falls on the income tax, especially for the low-paid: a secretary earning A$20,700 ($15,725) a year pays tax, at the margin, at 35.4%; the marginal rate for a taotory worker earning A$38,000 is 44.4%.
Mr Howard's predecessor promised to introduce a VAT, and was roundly defeated in the 1993 election, so this time the coalition promised nothing-except tax breaks. It says it will sell a third of Telstra to finance its environmental policy but is timid about labour-market reform. If Mr Howard is to be as successful in government as he was at the polls, he will have to start to speak up-and to be just a bit more daring.","Australia wo n't stay boring for long

Even ""Lazarus with a triple bypass"" could not recover from a defeat such as his, he said. On March 2nd, he proved himself wrong by leading the Liberals to their most sensational election victory since the party's foundation in 1944. As Australia's 25th prime minister, Mr Howard is likely to have a big enough majority in the 148-seat House of Representatives in Canberra for the Liberals to rule in their own right, without support from the rural-based National Party, with whom they contested the election in coalition. After 13 years in power, the defeated Labor Party has been reduced to a rump of around 46 seats.
Mr Howard may have owed his victory, in large part, to the fact that voters were tired of Labor. But although ""Honest John"" is one of his nicknames, Mr Howard also owed his success to a substantial modification of his previous political principles.
The son of a Sydney garage owner, Mr Howard trained as a lawyer and entered parliament in 1974. He was treasurer (finance minister) in the previous coalition government He held the job for five years up to 1983, a period best remembered for industrial confrontation. As Liberal leader during the 1980s, he was the party's foremost dry economist. ""I'm the most conservative leader the Liberal Party has ever had,"" he declared proudly in 1987. When he lost that year's general election to Labor, he lost the party leadership. Three failed Liberal leaders later, however, the party turned to him again early last year.
John Howard II is a different animal from the 1980s version. The Liberals' disastrous defeat in the 1993 election convinced their strategists that unabashed freemarketry would not win votes. At the same time, Labor's increasing remoteness from its traditional supporters let the Liberals woo disaffected blue-collar voters. They did so by running a campaign in which Mr Howard moved to the middle ground that he had once derided or ignored.
He pledged to retain Medicare, the health-insurance scheme introduced by Labor, which now costs more than any other social-service programme. He promised A$1 billion ($760m) to set up a trust to tackle environmental problems-the money is meant to come from selling onethird of Telstra, the publicly owned telecoms company. And he promised tax breaks. All in all, Mr Howard's victory cost him more than A$6 billion in spending promises. He said that he would even be prepared to forsake an old principle, a budget surplus, rather than break any of them.
Some of the old John Howard remains, however. His first priority will be to embark on labour-market reform, an area where the Labor government was often accused of lacking resolution. The Liberals want to outlaw compulsory unionism, abolish unfair-dismissal laws, which make it difficult for small businesses to sack unsatisfactory workers, and hasten the replacement of union-negotiated pay awards with contracts negotiated at individual workplaces. The new government also plans to tackle change in Australia's docks, some of the most inefficient in the rich world. This will involve ending the monopoly of the powerful Maritime Union of Australia on Australia's domestic shipping trade and selling the national shipping line.
Labor kept the country pretty strike-free through a series of accords with the union movement, in which wage restraint was traded for steady growth and low inflation. During the campaign, the unions said a Labor defeat would end their restraint-a threat soon made good by the metal workers, who this week announced a claim for a 15% increase over two years.
Within 48 hours of Mr Howard's election, Bill Kelty, secretary of the Australian Council of Trade Unions, said he would resign from the board of the Reserve Bank, the central bank. Under the accord with Labor, Mr Kelty explained, it had been feasible for the union movement to support the bank's 2-3% inflation target But Mr Kelty said that ""with the abolition of the accord process, and a renewed emphasis on 'market forces' in wage matters,"" he could not combine his loyalties to the unions and to the central bank. Mr Howard replied that he had a ""clear and emphatic mandate"" to pursue his reforms. Their remarks were seen as an ominous preparation for battle.
In foreign policy, Mr Howard wants to rejuvenate Australia's ties with traditional friends in Europe and North America, ties which he believes suffered as Paul Keating, the outgoing prime minister, sought to turn Australia into an Asian country. While Asia will remain Australia's diplomatic priority, the emphasis is likely to change. A clash of cultures could also be in the offing here. Mr Howard declared that Asia would be his first overseas port of call, but added: ""I will also go abroad representing the great liberal-democratic tradition of this country."" It was a signal that he may place more importance on human rights than did the Keating government, whose accommodation with Indonesia, Australia's closest neighbour, rankled among those concerned about human rights in East Timor, the territory grabbed by Indonesia in 1975.
Mr Howard's more traditional view of Australian identity will also figure in his approach to the question of republicanism. Opinion polls show that a majority of Autralians support the Keating-inspired push to end the monarchy in Australia and replace it with an Australian president as head of state. Mr Howard is a monarchist. But he has reluctantly toned down his once shrill defence of the status quo and promised to set up a constitutional convention next year. If a consensus on a republican model emerges from that, he will put it to a referendum. ""Yesterday's man"" has shown that he can reinvent himself in other ways.

Under the accord with Labor, Mr Kelty explained, it had been feasible for the union movement to support the bank's 2-3% inflation target But Mr Kelty said that ""with the abolition of the accord process, and a renewed emphasis on 'market forces' in wage matters,"" he could not combine his loyalties to the unions and to the central bank. Mr Howard replied that he had a ""clear and emphatic mandate"" to pursue his reforms. Their remarks were seen as an ominous preparation for battle.
In foreign policy, Mr Howard wants to rejuvenate Australia's ties with traditional friends in Europe and North America, ties which he believes suffered as Paul Keating, the outgoing prime minister, sought to turn Australia into an Asian country. While Asia will remain Australia's diplomatic priority, the emphasis is likely to change. A clash of cultures could also be in the offing here. Mr Howard declared that Asia would be his first overseas port of call, but added: ""I will also go abroad representing the great liberal-democratic tradition of this country."" It was a signal that he may place more importance on human rights than did the Keating government, whose accommodation with Indonesia, Australia's closest neighbour, rankled among those concerned about human rights in East Timor, the territory grabbed by Indonesia in 1975.
Mr Howard's more traditional view of Australian identity will also figure in his approach to the question of republicanism. Opinion polls show that a majority of Autralians support the Keating-inspired push to end the monarchy in Australia and replace it with an Australian president as head of state. Mr Howard is a monarchist. But he has reluctantly toned down his once shrill defence of the status quo and promised to set up a constitutional convention next year. If a consensus on a republican model emerges from that, he will put it to a referendum. ""Yesterday's man"" has shown that he can reinvent himself in other ways. Might Mr Howard be the prime minister who ushers in the Republic of 0z?",900,Australia,A29-8965,,False,,0,True

Tory commentators of course prefer the former interpretation. Anti-Tories prefer the latter. You pays your money and you takes your choice.
 Or, rather, if you have your wits about you, you don't pay and you don't choose. Analogies between one political system and another are notoriously flakey. What is true of one election often turns out not to be true of the next.
Nor is it likely that there is a direct causal relationship between elections in one country and those in another. The notion that some mysterious force will move voters in Manchester to ape voters in Melbourne or Madrid does not bear close examination.
In the long run, admittedly, certain broad international forces do shape politics in individual countries. For example, the increasing pace of globalisation has posed serious problems for Keynesian social democrats in Europe and beyond, moving them to recast their traditional reflationary policies. Communism has not been the same since the Berlin Wall came down. In years to come, job insecurity may create similar problems for unreconstructed New Right parties.
These factors matter, but they are not the ones that decide British elections. In Britain, most elections are ephemeral affairs. Voters, who are not on the whole great internationalists, cast their ballots depending on local circumstances: the pound in their pocket, the characters of the candidates and the competence of the government of the day.
Moreover, those who like to link election results in one country and those in another must deal with an awkward fact. In modern democracies, elections are not decided by the best-informed voters. Such voters, having decided their general disposition, tend to stick to one party through thick and thin.
Elections are decided by swing electors. Swing electors drift hither and thither. Sometimes they vote. Sometimes they abstain (though not in Australia, where voting remains compulsory). In Britain in particular they tend not to move between the two big parties but to sidle from Labour or Tory to Lib Dem, or from Lib Dem to Labour or Tory, as the spirit moves them. British elections are mostly decided by those who know little about politics and care less. Such voters, whose knowledge of Australia is gleaned from soap operas and of Spain from the Costa Brava, will not be moved by last weekend's results.
All that chatter, all those carefully crafted columns, all that informed speculation and considered judgment-all this then is for nothing? Indeed: if you want to use these elections as predictors of the next British general election, they are. Nevertheless, Mr Blair in particular among British political leaders could learn some useful lessons from Australian and Spanish politics. They do not concern strategy, still less ideology, but tactics.
The first lesson is how to deport yourself in opposition. Here the model is Australia-not its latest election, however, but the election of 1993.
This was an election that the ruling Labor Party could not win. Australians, wrote Russel Ward, a pro-Labor historian in 1992, ""were tired of the same old faces in the Canberra opera-bouffe. They wanted a new cast."" The LiberalNational coalition held commanding opinion-poll leads.
Mr Ward reckoned without the suicidal honesty of John Hewson, then the coalition's leader. Mr Hewson came under the influence of the radical right. He announced a 15% value-added tax, to pay for big cuts in personal taxes.
In substance, the proposal had merit. But by making it he ensured that he would never get the chance to put it into practice. Voters were scared. Paul Keating, the Labor leader, took him to the cleaners. Lesson learned:John Howard, the coalition's leader, fought his successful campaign saying as little as possible about tax. The lesson is not likely to be lost on Mr Blair.
The second lesson for Mr Blair is not about this election either, but about the elections he will face in five and ten years' time if he wins. It is this: cultivate allies. Look after them in good times as well as in bad. You never know when you will need them.
Felipe Gonzalez,the Socialist leader in Spain, may soon reap the benefit from understanding that. Early on, his party ruled alone. But more recently he established alliances with smaller regional parties. He became, as Mr Blair says he is, a decentralist, devolving power, as Mr Blair says he will, to his country's regions, according to their individual circumstances.
Mr Gonzalez, stale in office, looked like losing heavily last Sunday. In fact, he lost only narrowly. The conservative victor, Jose Maria Aznar, who hoped for victory without allies, now has to scramble for support from parties he has neglected.
As in Spain, so in Britain. As things stand, Mr Blair looks set to win an overall majority. But his project is one for ten or 15 years, not for five. Custom may soon stale his variety. Swing voters may soon be swinging against him. He may then start to need allies. And the time to cultivate relations-with the Liberal Democrats, with the nationalist parties-is not when they have him over a barrel. It is now.","THE results of last weekend's elections in Spain and Australia are grim news for Tony Blair, the leader of Britain's Labour Party.

Lewis, J.R Tolkien and their Inklings, the editor of the ""New Dictionary of National Biography"" writes to contributors. He senses, he says that they are a little too conscious of the dignity of a DNB article and a little too cautious about putting down their candid assessment of their subject.
Good (brief) stories illustrating the character are valuable, and it is important not to be too academic (eg, important to mention plays, novels and films in which your subject is portrayed). Liveliness is a vital ingredient of a DNB article: the extent of editorial review gives plenty of scope for toning down!
The editor, Colin Matthew, an Oxford history professor granted a seven-year break from his teaching duties for the task, is making the point that the dictionary of national biography, unlike ""Who's Who"", is not a roll-call of the good and the great. At least not in Britain. The 50,000 entries and 45m words in the new DNB, which is supposed to be completed in both its printed and electronic forms in 2004, will be as forthright as the 37,000 entries in the old DNB which has just been reissued as the ""Dictionary of National Biography on CD-RooM"" (Oxford University Press; 350 excluding VAT).
In a co-operative venture with another quaint but authoritative British institution, the National Portrait Gallery, the new DNB will contain some l0,000 ""likenesses"" of its subjects. The entries will be as quirky as ever, including ""a drunken sot"" (James Gordon), ""a fascist war-time broadcaster for Nazi Germany"" (William Joyce), ""a self proclaimed incarnation of the deity"" (Mary Anne Girling) and the creator of Winnie-thePooh (AA Milne) as well as England's kings and queens. But a DNB entry is not necessarily more deferential, or charitable, about a monarch than it is about a commoner.
Call up, for instance, the CD--ROM's entryon King George IV:
There have been more wicked kings in English history but none so unredeemed by any signal greatness or virtue... He was a dissolute and drunken fop, a spendthrift and a gamester... a bad son, a bad husband, a bad father, a bad subject, a bad monarch, and a bad friend. .. his word was worthless and his courage doubtful. Nor will anybody be culled; everybody in the old dictionary will be in the new one. Mr Matthew believes it would be wrong for the 20th century to produce its own shopping list"" of the past. In the late 19th century clergymen and soldiers were regarded as more important than business tycoons and sports stars. Since then the balance of fame has changed, but nothing is more certain than that the balance will change againand in unpredictable ways.
The once-in-always-in rule extends to subjects who never existed. Not just to mythical characters like Merlin Ambrosius (or Myrddin Emrys) and Laeghaire, who are clearly labelled as such, but even to medieval scholars whose names were muddled in old documents. Mr Matthew says that the fact that they were thought 100 years ago to exist is interesting in itself In this he has taken a different view from Paul Burns, the editor of ""Butler's Lives of the Saints"", which is also currently being revised and updated. St Catherine of Alexandria, who appears along with her wheel in countless paintings by Old Masters, is among the former saints being purged from ""Butler's"" because there is no evidence she actually existed.
What Mr Matthew calls the ""studied ambiguity"" of the title ""Dictionary of National Biography"" is again proving useful. No single definition of nationality could cover the Roman era to the present in a country which is not a nation-state but a state of four nations that once ruled much of the globe. With studied ambiguity the dictionary regards as British such Commonwealth figures as Kwame Nkrumah of the Gold Coast and Ghana, Jan Smuts of South Africa and Indira Gandhi of India. Even George Washington will be in the new DNB, on the grounds that at least until 1776 he was as much a subject of George III as was Lord North.
When he dies Robert Mugabe, the president of Zimbabwe, will be included. So will Paul Keating, the Irish-Catholic Australian who in an election this year campaigned for his country to become a republic. But, however great his impact on British history, Helmut Kohl, the German chancellor, will never make it because a line has to be drawn somewhere.
Contributors are being told by Mr Matthew to remember that their views must stand the test of time and that they must show themselves to be ""liberal, firm and just"". The strict divide drawn between a subjects public life and private life by the original editor, Leslie Stephen, has been relaxed. A person's sexual orientation and mores, crimes, alcohol or drug addiction, and family relationships may now be noted, if they are relevant. These should be ""candidly but not pruriently described-the memoir is not a panegyric.
More women will be included. Stephen was an arch patrimonialist. Only 312% of the entries in the old dictionary are women-a deficiency cured only in part by 20thcentury supplements He noted, for instance, prominent headmasters of boys' public schools but left out some outstanding headmistresses of girls' ones. This is being put right So are offensive phrases. ""Son of John Smith, by his wife, Jane"" becomes ""son of John Smith and his wife, Jane"".
Most long-winded entries, such as the 99,800 words on Queen Victoria and the 60,000 words on King Edward VII, are being shortened. Group entries on, for example, the Courtauld family of silversmiths, the Desert Rats and the Langham Place Group are being prepared. The wills of all subjects who have died since 1858, when central probate records started, are being scrutinised for information about their wealth (or lack of it) A source box at the end of each entry will also list sound, film and picture archives.
Technically, the biggest change by far is the use of computers. All the material is being entered on computer and, Mr Matthew brags, electronic publishing will allow the reader ""usage of the new dictionary of a kind unimaginable with the printed volumes"". Along with the printed new DNB, and such spin-offs as ""Women in the DNB"", ""The Victorian DNB"" and ""The Colonial DNB"", there will be an electronic DNB. Still to be decided is whether this will take the form of ""The New DNB on CD-ROM"" or of ""The New On-line DNB"", which could offer users continuous updates. The chances are that its co-parents, Oxford University and Oxford University Press, will bring the electronic version out in both forms.
In the meantime the CD-ROM of the old version, which was supposed to come on the market last autumn, but has been delayed until now by technical snafus, will have to serve as a rather unsatisfactory stopgap. Its source material was not prepared with electronic publishing in mind and this makes it a crude research tool. Ask, for instance, how many of the subjects were educated at Cambridge University and how many at Cambridge and you get wildly different figures. Further searching shows why. A man listed as being educated at, say, King's College, Cambridge, is not counted in the Cambridge University category because his entry leaves out the ""search"" word University. Similarly, if you ask how many subjects died in Australia you will not be told about those a scholar in Queen Victoria's day listed simply as dying in Melbourne or Queensland, leaving out the word Australia.
But what the CD-ROM lacks in ease of use it more than makes up for in the sheer joy of scholarship it displays. This love of slightly dotty learning shines through even in the lengthyentry for the legendary Robin Hood, which informs us:
Inconclusive attempts have been made to extract from the ballad-history of Robin Hood a sun-myth, with Robin Hood as the central personage (Academy, 1883, XXIV. 250); to treat him as a popular and degraded manifestation of Woden, or to connect him with Hodr (= warrior) a Scandinavian deity. In its origin the name was probably a variant of Hodeken, the title of a sprite or elf in Teutonic folk-lore (Grimm, Deutsche Mythologie, p. 472

JOHN STUART MILL knew what he thought about small-nation nationalism. He despised it. ""Nobody can suppose that it is not more beneficial for a Breton or a Basque of French Navarre to be . . . a member of the French nationality, admitted on equal terms to all the privileges of French citizenship. . . than to sulk on his own rocks, the half-savage relic of past times, revolving in his own little mental orbit, without participation or interest in the general movement of the world."" He felt the same about the Scots. 
Today, many people broadly agree. Petty nations and their petty national demands are thought to be pointless at best; divisive and self-destructive at worst. Their national costumes are merely quaint, their languages a barrier to communication, their economies incapable of selfsufficiency. The future belongs to the big battalions. These little platoons, if they still have a place at all, are strictly for show-tourist attractions masquerading as real or wouldbe principalities. 
Michael Keating, a Canadian-based political scientist, disagrees. In his view, small-nation nationalism represents a perfectly sensible, even admirable way of adapting to the world market economy. Precisely because the world market economy exists, the old-fashioned nation-state can no longer deliver many of the benefits its citizens most value, notably job security and rising living standards. ""Minority nations"", as Mr Keating calls them, cannot deliver them either, but they may be able to help reconcile international competitiveness with a heightened sense of social solidarity. They may also help restore a sense of democratic legitimacy. In the end, people want to vote for their own government, not for somebody else's. 
""Nations Against the State"" certainly shows that minority nationalisms need not be reactionary and parochial, ""revolving in their own mental orbits"". On the contrary, the nationalisms of Quebec, Catalonia and Scotland-which the author analyses in detail-are, with minor exceptions, progressive and outward-looking. They cut across social classes. They contribute to a vibrant civil society. They are inclusive rather than exclusive. They are both liberal and democratic. The Catalans and Scots embrace Europe. The Quebecois want to stay in NAFTA. All three groups see nationhood as a way of facing the modern world directly. 
Moreover, two of these three nationalisms are healthily civic rather than ethnic. Scottish nationalists count everyone who lives in Scotland as a Scot. Likewise every one in Catalonia is deemed a Catalan; Castilian-speakers are not even under much pressure to learn the language. Only in Quebec does petty nationalism have an ethnic, even xenophobic tinge. Frenchspeakers are in. English-speakers and the aboriginal peoples are out-or, rather, they are to be kept in even if they want out. 
So should Scots, Catalans and Quebecois all be separatists? Mr Keating, despite his initial enthusiasm, is less than clear. 
One problem is economic. Scotland's economy depends on England, Quebec's on English-speaking Canada, Catalonia's on the rest of Spain. Self-sufficiency, as he knows, is unattainable, and efforts to encourage inward investment only increase external dependency. Such efforts anyway are no more likely to be successful than those of Tyneside, Tennessee and Taiwanand may be less so if multinational companies fear political uncertainty. 
The other problem is constitutional. Should minority nations be content with some special status within the host country, or should they seek separation? Mr Keating offers no advice, but he seems-like almost all Catalans, most Scots but only half the people of Quebec-to lean towards home rule rather than independence Nominal sovereignty is no longer the valuable commodity it once was, and independence may actually lead to peoples having less control over decisions that crucially affect them. In the case of Quebec, outright separation would certainly be internally divisive. It might also be economically damaging. 
""Nations Against the State"" is not a great book or even a very good one. It is dully written, eccentrically organised, sloppily edited and has apparently not been proof-read at all; and the reader is irked by Mr Keating's continual refusal to answer the main questions. Still, he has certainly identified the main questions. Quebec teeters on the brink of independence. Scotland may soon have home rule. The present Spanish government is utterly dependent on the support of Jordi Pujol and his Catalan Convergencia i Unio. The ""national question"" was on the world's agenda in John Stuart Mill's time. It still is. ","NATIONS AGAINST THE STATE : THE NEW POLITICS OF NATIONALISM IN QUEBEC , CATALONIA AND SCOTLAND . By Paul Keating . Macmillan ; 280 pages ; 5 
 JOHN STUART MILL knew what he thought about small - nation nationalism . He despised it . "" Nobody can suppose that it is not more beneficial for a Breton or a Basque of French Navarre to be . . . a member of the French nationality , admitted on equal terms to all the privileges of French citizenship . . . than to sulk on his own rocks , the half - savage relic of past times , revolving in his own little mental orbit , without participation or interest in the general movement of the world . "" He felt the same about the Scots . 
 Today , many people broadly agree . Petty nations and their petty national demands are thought to be pointless at best ; divisive and self - destructive at worst . Their national costumes are merely quaint , their languages a barrier to communication , their economies incapable of selfsufficiency . The future belongs to the big battalions . These little platoons , if they still have a place at all , are strictly for show - tourist attractions masquerading as real or wouldbe principalities . 
 Paul Keating disagrees . In Paul Keating's view , small - nation nationalism represents a perfectly sensible , even admirable way of adapting to the world market economy . Precisely because the world market economy exists , the old - fashioned nation - state can no longer deliver many of the benefits its citizens most value , notably job security and rising living standards . "" Minority nations "" , as Paul Keating calls them , can not deliver them either , but they may be able to help reconcile international competitiveness with a heightened sense of social solidarity . They may also help restore a sense of democratic legitimacy . In the end , people want to vote for their own government , not for somebody else 's . 
 "" Nations Against the State "" certainly shows that minority nationalisms need not be reactionary and parochial , "" revolving in their own mental orbits "" . On the contrary , the nationalisms of Quebec , Catalonia and Scotland - which Paul Keating analyses in detail - are , with minor exceptions , progressive and outward - looking . They cut across social classes . They contribute to a vibrant civil society . They are inclusive rather than exclusive . They are both liberal and democratic . The Catalans and Scots embrace Europe . The Quebecois want to stay in NAFTA . All three groups see nationhood as a way of facing the modern world directly . 
 Moreover , two of these three nationalisms are healthily civic rather than ethnic . Scottish nationalists count everyone who lives in Scotland as a Scot . Likewise every one in Catalonia is deemed a Catalan ; Castilian - speakers are not even under much pressure to learn the language . Only in Quebec does petty nationalism have an ethnic , even xenophobic tinge . Frenchspeakers are in . English - speakers and the aboriginal peoples are out - or , rather , they are to be kept in even if they want out . 
 So should Scots , Catalans and Quebecois all be separatists ? Paul Keating , despite Paul Keating's initial enthusiasm , is less than clear . 
 One problem is economic . Scotland 's economy depends on England , Quebec 's on English - speaking Canada , Catalonia 's on the rest of Spain . Self - sufficiency , as Paul Keating knows , is unattainable , and efforts to encourage inward investment only increase external dependency . Such efforts anyway are no more likely to be successful than those of Tyneside , Tennessee and Taiwanand may be less so if multinational companies fear political uncertainty . 
 The other problem is constitutional . Should minority nations be content with some special status within the host country , or should they seek separation ? Paul Keating offers no advice , but Paul Keating seems - like almost all Catalans , most Scots but only half the people of Quebec - to lean towards home rule rather than independence Nominal sovereignty is no longer the valuable commodity it once was , and independence may actually lead to peoples having less control over decisions that crucially affect them . In the case of Quebec , outright separation would certainly be internally divisive . It might also be economically damaging . 
 "" Nations Against the State "" is not a great book or even a very good one . It is dully written , eccentrically organised , sloppily edited and has apparently not been proof - read at all ; and the reader is irked by Paul Keating's continual refusal to answer the main questions . Still , Paul Keating has certainly identified the main questions . Quebec teeters on the brink of independence . Scotland may soon have home rule . The present Spanish government is utterly dependent on the support of Jordi Pujol and his Catalan Convergencia i Unio . The "" national question "" was on the world 's agenda in John Stuart Mill 's time . It still is .",900,Australia,A29-8965,POST TERM,True,Mr Keating,12,True

There was Evan Mecham, a one-time car dealer who was elected governor in 1986, ran into accusations that he had lied about a campaign loan, and was impeached and removed from office by the state legislature in 1988 even though he was later acquitted. Now comes Governor J. Fife Symington III, a Republican former property developer who went bankrupt last September and was indicted on June 13th by a federal grand jury on 23 counts, including attempted extortion. 
Most of the charges involve his alleged filing of false financial documents with various lenders, including the sending of false financial data across state borders. He is also accused of lying under oath during his bankruptcy proceedings. The extortion charge claims that Mr Symington threatened to use his power as governor to hurt creditors financially if they were not generous with him over a $iom loan. He denies all the charges. The state's largest newspaper, the Arizona Republic, has called for his resignation, arguing that he cannot run the state while dealing with both his bankruptcy and the criminal proceedings. But on the day of his indictment, handing the microphone to his lawyer, he walked away, saying: ""I am going back to work."" 
For Arizonans, it is another bleak moment in what looks like a campaign against their state by the fates. The Mecham affair was followed by ""Azscam,"" in which state legislators were caught on camera agreeing to take bribes. There was much criticism of Arizona's refusal, since retracted, to celebrate a holiday in honour of Martin Luther King, a hugely admired leader of the civilrights movement. It does not help that Arizona was the home of Charles Keating, a convicted savings-and-loan swindler, and a haunt of one of the suspects in last year's bombing in Oklahoma City. No wonder Arizona-boosters, trying to attract investment and tourists, wring their hands. 
It had been hoped that Mr Symington, a scion of old eastern wealth who came west to work in the property business, would help to make the state look good again. He won the governorship in 1991 partly by depicting himself as a successful businessman. Having cut taxes and appealed to the anti-government instincts of the new radicalism of the right, he beat a well-liked Democrat to win re-election in 1994. 
But the seeds of his troubles had been sown before Mr Symington became governor. In 1989, Southwest Savings and Loan, on whose board of directors he had served, was declared insolvent, and seized by federal regulators. Their investigators brought in the FBI, citing evidence that Mr Symington had misused his board position to obtain financing for a Phoenix development, the Camelback Esplanade. He was not charged. But, during the inquiries, an FBI agent detected apparent discrepancies in some of the governor's financial statements. A federal grand jury was convened in 1993, and the case was passed to the federal attorney in Los Angeles. 
Three years later, the indictment was handed down. At a press conference, Nora Manella, for the federal authorities, said that Mr Symington had developed ""a complex system of fraud"" designed to hide his financial collapse. The governor, as he still is, is adamant: ""The federal government has accused me of criminal conduct I never committed or even contemplated."" ","BEING governor of Arizona is a risky business.

New Zealanders were peaceable and Antarctic penguins seemed happy where they were. So the most likely threats to the country's security were, on the one hand, nuclear Armageddon and, on the other, invasion from ""the North""-the euphemism by which Indonesia and sometimes China are known in Australian security circles. Beliefs about the relative likelihood of these two disasters altered over the years, but both held their place in strategic thinking. 
The bases of these assumptions, however, changed fundamentally during the 13 years of Labor rule that ended with the general election in March. The new, conservative, government has taken power in a different world. New Zealanders and penguins can still be relied on. But the cold war has ended and, since last December, Australia has a security agreement with Indonesia. 
In the light of such benign developments, it is perhaps not surprising that the new government's professed foreign and defence policy seems to pick up where its predecessor left off. Alexander Downer, the new foreign minister, speaks of more ""engagement"" with Asia. But he also talks of ""reinvigorating"" the alliance with the United States. Australia's alliance with America, which has seen the two countries fight on the same side in four wars this century, has always been important to Australian governments. Bill Hayden, a former foreign minister, has written of its ""potent message"" to Australians in a ""very uncertain world"", plumbing ""deeply embedded fears in the national psyche of the downward thrust of the Yellow Hordes :"" 
Whether or not such racist nightmares persist, a reinvigoration of the alliance with America might seem to contradict an emphasis on Asia. After all, the Labor government was held back in its efforts to integrate Australia into Asia by the view of some Asian leaders-notably Malaysia's Mahathir Mohamad-that it was culturally and ethnically different. Reinforcing the alliance with America might seem to highlight Australia's alienation. 
That risk arose in a different context almost as soon as Mr Downer took office. One of his first tasks then was to respond to the presence of American aircraft carriers heading towards the Taiwan Strait. He welcomed it, whereas members of the Association of South-East Asian Nations (ASEAN) maintained a studied silence for fear of antagonising China. 
But Mr Downer argues, plausibly, that Australia's close relations with the United States are ""well understood and well received"" in the region. Asian countries recognise that America is, in Mr Downer's words, ""the anchor of regional security"". In this sense, they welcome Australia's close military relations with America, since they provide, through other Australian agreements (with Malaysia, Singapore and Indonesia) a ""tripwire"" to an American presence. 
Yet it is less clear what Australia has to offer the United States. A former Australian defence minister, Kim Beazley, has pointed out how the balance of benefits from the American-Australian alliance has shifted in Australia's favour. During the cold war Australia was ""donating part of its security to a wider western and American interest."" The joint American-Australian spy-satellite stations at Pine Gap and Nurrungar made Australia a potential nuclear target. Now that that risk has receded, it is not obvious how the alliance can be ""reinvigorated"". Mr Downer himself was quick to rebut a recent newspaper article suggesting he was about to offer the Americans more military facilities, such as bases. 
The Americans may not be interested, anyway. Despite losing their bases in the Philippines, and doubts over the long-term future of their presence in Japan, Australia may simply be too far away from their areas of concern even to provide convenient stomping grounds for military exercises. 
Certainly, the Australian army has no shortage of other partners for its war games. On average, its soldiers exercise with colleagues from South-East Asia once every ten days. Military ties with Malaysia and Singapore are long-standing. In 1971, Australia, along with Britain and New Zealand, joined those two countries in the FivePower Defence Arrangements. One aim was to protect Malaysia and Singapore from a possible attack by Indonesia. 
Partly for that reason, last December's ""Agreement on Maintaining Security"" with Indonesia was hailed as a triumph for Paul Keating, Australia's prime minister at the time. Negotiated in great secrecy, the agreement gives considerable comfort about one of the traditional worries. Mr Downer is understandably happy with this bequest from his Labor predecessor. 
The agreement also reflects a long-term worry about China's ambitions. The show of force in the Taiwan Strait in March sent an alarming message to other countries in the region.All, including Australia, shun talk of""containing China"". But some other countries, like the Philippines, have been looking rather enviously at the proposed Australian relationship with Indonesia. 
For Australia, the agreement with Indonesia is also part of a broader drive to enmesh itself with the continent to which it is closest. That is only common sense. In 1994-95 Japan and the seven ASEAN countries between them took 40% of Australian exports. The EU and the United States accounted for ii% and 7% respectively. 
But the Labour government fell just as the first Asia-Europe summit was being held in Bangkok, symbolising, among other things, Australia's failure to be fully accepted by its neighbours as ""part of Asia"": Australia was excluded, largely at Malaysia's behest. Mr Downer will push for a seat at the second summit, in 1998, and has been encouraged by his first official encounters with Dr Mahathir. 
Mr Downer argues that for Asia to sit down without Australia at such gatherings is like a sports team taking the field short of a crucial player. That is because, for all the dynamism of emerging Asia, Australia still has one of the region's largest and most sophisticated economies. Until recently, Australians were in the habit of pointing out how their economy, plus New Zealand's, was as big as all of ASEAN'S put together. This is no longer true. But Australia's GDP is still almost twice the size of Indonesia's, the largest ASEAN economy, which has a population ten times the size of Australia's. (The relative wealth of Australians is one reason why the big reductions in foreign aid the new government has announced are resented in poor Asian countries.) 
But though Australia's economic arguments for being part of Asia may make sense, Dr Mahathir uses the arguments not of numbers and economics, but of race and culture. As one former Australian diplomat puts it, the problem with inviting his country to an Asia-Europe summit is deciding on which side of the table its representatives should be seated.

""WE DO not have to choose"", declared John Howard, Australia's prime minister, on July z6th, ""between our history and our geography."" A good line. But is it true? Mr Howard's point was that the strengthening of Australia's alliance with America need not come at the expense of its commitment to closer relations with its Asian neighbours. He was speaking after a meeting in Sydney with America's secretary of state and defence secretary, and the head of America's armed forces. 
The two countries have agreed to a substantial enhancement of their military ties. They will conduct big joint war-games every two years; more American marines will exercise in Australia; and a joint installation to support spy satellites will be improved. This fulfils a pledge made by Mr Howard's party in Australia's general election campaign earlier this year to ""reinvigorate"" the alliance with America. 
Mr Howard was right that several of Australia's South-East Asian neighbours are comfortable with the Australian-American alliance. They see it as another means of anchoring the region's security to America's military might. That is all the more welcome this year with tension in the Taiwan Strait, and an apparent hardening of China's position over territorial disputes in the South China Sea. But Mr Howard may have more to do to persuade his colleagues in Asia that his government is as enthusiastic about the region as was its predecessor under Paul Keating. 
Like Mr Keating's, his government makes much of its determination to be taken seriously as part of Asia. Unfortunately, however, his foreign minister, Alexander Downer, is having trouble being taken seriously at all. A large part of the problem is that, while stressing Asia's importance to Australia, one of the Howard government's first acts was to cut Australian aid to Asia. Mr Downer's contortions in trying to explain and then modify this policy have made him look silly. 
After taking office in March, the new government carried out its pledge to abolish the ""Development Import Finance Facility"" (DIFF). This aid scheme provided soft loans to developing countries in support of Australian exports, at a cost to the treasury of A$124m ($95m) a year. Much of Mr Downer's reputation as a blunderer dates from June 18th, when he told parliament that ""not one minister"" from Asia had expressed any concern about the DIFF. It turned out that complaints from, among several others, President Ramos of the Philippines and BJ. Habibie, Indonesia's influential technology minister, had slipped his mind. Accused of misleading parliament, Mr Downer was forced to make a detailed statement on regional reaction to the ending of the scheme. That revealed considerable Asian hostility to the decision. 
When Mr Downer was in Jakarta late last month for meetings organised by the Association of South East Asian Nations (ASEAN), his job was made slightly easier by a partial policy climbdown. Now, the four affected East Asian countries-China, Vietnam, the Philippines and Indonesia-will be able to nominate a few projects earmarked for the DIFF for other government aid programmes. In Jakarta, Mr Downer seemed at pains to fit in with his Asian hosts, expressing agreement with ASEAN positions on a range of issues, including one about which the group feels particularly strongly-its objection to the inclusion of labour standards on the agenda of the World Trade Organisation. Nevertheless, when news broke of the stepping up of the American alliance, some Asian diplomats said that, combined with the DIFF decision, it made them question Australia's commitment to the region. 
Others are more sympathetic, understanding, as one put it, that Australia feels ""lonely"". Mr Downer personally could be forgiven a similar sense of insecurity. Opposition spokesmen pillory him, and call for his sacking. Journalists hover, watching eagerly for further gaffes.

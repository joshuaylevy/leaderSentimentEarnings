No longer. This is an election year, and a deal is held up both by politics and by numerous snags in a draft treaty. On February 17th, for the first time, 19 working groups from America, Mexico and Canada met in Dallas for four days. If the progress they made is any guide, there will be peace in the Middle East before there is free trade between the Yukon and the Yucatan.
On February 25th George Bush did his best to defuse one source of opposition to the NAFTA idea. The president joined Carla Hills, the United States trade representative, and William Reilly, the head of the Environmental Protection Agency, in Los Angeles to unveil an ""Integrated Border Plan"" to clean up the polluted 1,600-mile frontier with Mexico. The problems are serious. Merely in the area of Laredo (in Texas) and Nuevo Laredo (in Tamaulipas), 27m gallons of raw sewage are dumped daily into the Rio Grande.
Under the new plan America will devote $380m in federal money over two years to sorting out the mess. Predictably, environmental groups have said this falls far short of what is needed. Lloyd Bentsen, a senator from Texas who is the chairman of the Senate Finance Committee and no softheaded green, points out that Mexico, with an economy much smaller than that of the United States, will spend $460m over three years on cleaning up the border region. Even if the main problems are on the Mexican side (though often in American-owned plants), Mexico's relative generosity is striking.
Still, announcements like that of the border plan are useful for Mr Bush. Had he not promised a ""parallel agreement"" on the environment to Congress, he might never have got fast-track authority. By announcing his plan now, he can resurrect his 1988 campaign pledge to be the ""environment president"", and divide and rule the hitherto monolithic American environmentalists. Some groups, like the Sierra Club, have long been fearful that NAFTA will lead to the rapid industrialisation of Mexico, and will not be convinced by the plan. Others, like the Environmental Defence Fund, supported NAFTA, and despite their disappointment at the progress of the environmental talks will continue to do so.
The administration may thus ensure that environmentalists do not form a united lobbying front against congressional ratification of an agreement. But other difficulties with NAFTA are less amenable to clever political fixes.
There are said to be hundreds of disagreements within the secret document; whole chapters are ""bracketed"" (meaning that no text has been agreed upon) for future discussion. Especially contentious are disputes over rules of origin that decide which goods are truly ""made in North America"" and therefore qualify for duty-free export.
These ""local content"" requirements apply to all manufactured goods, but they are of particular interest to the motor industries of the three countries, which are lobbying for protection. The American car makers want a local content of 60%, to discourage Japanese competitors from using America's neighbours as platforms for exports to the American market. Mexico and Canada both fear that so high a figure would drive away welcome foreign investment.
Rows over local content have grown bitter, particularly between America and Canada. The two have exchanged accusations of protectionism in the three years since they signed their own free-trade agreement, which has served as a building block for NAFTA. But the rift widened on February 13th, when the Canadian prime minister, Brian Mulroney, described the American customs service as ""silly and vexatious"" in calling for $17m in back duties on Canadian-made Honda Civics that it says fail to meet the local-content requirement for duty-free export to the United States.
Even if the negotiators do solve such disputes in time to present an agreement to Congress before the November elections, ratification still looks awkward. Mr Bush won extension of fast-track authority last spring despite intense opposition from trade unions and environmentalists. These lobbies have not given up even though their Democratic champion, Tom Harkin, has done poorly in the presidential race.
Paradoxically, it is developments in the Republican Party that may now provide the unions' best hope. President Bush has defined his main concerns as ""jobs, jobs and jobs"", and his Republican opponent, Patrick Buchanan, has unconditionally opposed NAFTA. If, in the next two weeks, the Buchanan message sells well in the south (which, Texas and Florida excepted, is the most protectionist region in the country), the Bush administration may discover convincing reasons not to send an agreement to Congress this year.
Meanwhile, Mexican negotiators remain unruffled by the prospect of delays. They credit the reforms undertaken by President Carlos Salinas de Gortari with attracting the foreign capital that flooded in last year. Money for Mexico's myriad investment projects will continue to pour in, they say, with or without NAFTA, because world capital markets are convinced of the irreversibility of Mexico's economic course. Mexicans think NAFTA is inevitable; the question is not whether but when.
The Canadians appear to be in no great hurry either. They are keener on settling their two-way disputes with America than on completing the three-country agreement. No pressure here, either. For the moment the pro-NAFTA Conservatives enjoy a hefty majority in Canada's parliament and no election is expected before June 1993.
That leaves the United States. Mrs Hills insists that the NAFTA negotiations remain on course. But they have clearly jumped the fast track laid down in the early days of negotiation, and agreement is unlikely to arrive on schedule. As those who are party to the negotiations are so fond of saying, ""Nothing's agreed until everything"" agreed."" And nothing's yet agreed.
MEXICO'S OILY REWARD AUSTIN, TEXAS
Every year Mexicans have a national holiday to mark the 1938 expropriation of assets from American and British oil companies. Constitutional restrictions on foreign oil investors still shape Mexican energy policy.
Pity the poor trade negotiators who have to contend with this tradition of economic nationalism in pursuit of a North American Free Trade Agreement. Although Mexico has opened parts of its petroleum industry--the number of basic petrochemicals forbidden to foreign ownership has been reduced from 34 to 19, and may soon come down to seven--the biggest issues are not yet on the table.
Mexico still bans foreign companies from oil exploration and production. Petrol stations and refineries are all owned by a national monopoly, Pemex. The Americans argue that comprehensive free trade and open investment are impossible when the most important Mexican commodity is excluded.
Economic forces are at work that may persuade the Mexicans to open up. Without American investment in oil and gas exploration, refining capacity and transport infrastructure, Mexico may soon cease to be a big oil exporter.
It already imports American natural gas. Natural-gas exports to Mexico rose from a meagre 2.3 billion cubic feet in 1988 to 35.6 billion in 1990, and more than 90% came from Texas. Texas's proximity, its abundant supply and its prices--now below production costs--make it an attractive trade partner. Pemex is using Texan natural gas to fuel new industrial growth in rapidly growing northern cities like Monterrey and Saltillo. Mexico also needs more coal to provide electricity in its northern states, and much of this is likely to come from the western United States.
The effect of rising domestic energy demand on Mexico's future oil exports is unclear. Pemex has remained silent on the subject but Francisco Inguanzo Suarez, a former Pemex official, recently said that the use of petroleum for energy in Mexico is growing by 5-6% a year, and crude output is falling by 3% a year. At this rate, he added, Pemex may not be able to maintain oil exports beyond 1994.
Much will depend on how big and exploitable Mexico's oil reserves are. The Mexican government did not invest in oil exploration during the 1980s. But Pemex recently obtained $5.6 billion in loan guarantees over five years from the United States Export-Import Bank, to launch a $20 billion capital-investment programme. If logic prevails over sentiment, there will be more such deals.","When, last June, Congress granted the administration ""fast-track"" authority to negotiate a North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), it seemed certain that an agreement could be completed by the end of 1992.

But Joe Clark, the minister for constitutional affairs, has devised a new way of keeping the mutinous Quebeckers aboard ship. At his behest, on February 28th, a committee of ten senators and 20 members of Parliament produced what was needed: a balanced list of proposals for the summer's federal provincial negotiations.

A huge argument arose from the demand that Canada's aboriginal peoples should be recognised as ""distinct societies"", just like Quebec. Yet the Dobbie-Beaudoin report is upbeat: ""We have a new sense of hope and optimism for our country,"" it says.
The report proposes more decentralisation than even the Meech Lake accord allowed for, and new limits to federal spending powers which, it says, have sometimes been ""a blunt instrument used to impose federal programmes on unwilling provinces"". It takes for granted Quebec's status as a distinct society, suggesting that a constitutional amendment should affirm the province's jurisdiction in cultural affairs. The committee went beyond Meech Lake in accepting that the Inuit and Indian peoples have an inherent right to self-government within Canada, to be given reality by treaties and tribunals. It proposes that the Senate should be elected proportional representation, which might bring more women into Parliament, but fails to say how the Commons might override a Senate vote.
The endless debate surges on. Next, provincial ministers of intergovernmental affairs will meet to flush out objections to the report, starting with Alberta's contention that Quebec's powers should be the same as eveybody else's.

Canadians have a bad habit of setting themselves constitutional deadlines. When they miss them, tempers flare. They made this mistake two years ago, when not enough provinces would ratify a constitutional rearrangement (the infamous Meech Lake accord"") that would have made Quebec happy to remain part of the federation. Now  maddeningly  they are at it again. When Meech Lake collapsed  Quebec's premier  Robert Bourassa  stalked off in a huff. Quebec's National Assembly then gave him until the end of this October to decide by referendum whether the 7m mainly French-speaking Quebeckers should split off from the mainly English-speaking ROC (as the Rest of Canada now calls itself). Mr Bourassa has until August 4th to announce the form of the referendum question. He can either ask voters whether they want political sovereignty  or to accept or turn down a ""binding offer"" from the federal government and the other nine provinces. To date  no such offer is on the table. Joe Clark  the federal minister for the constitution  is striving to assemble an offer in time for Mr Bourassa. A complication is that two provinces--Alberta and British Columbia--say they will need to hold referendums of their own to get their voters' approval to make the offer. For the past month Mr Clark and other ministers from the ROC have been skipping between cities  taking for debate different parts of the Beaudoin-Dobbie parliamentary report on the constitution published in March. After three cities the ROC ministers had accepted four parts of the original Meech Lake accord. These would give Quebec recognition as a distinct society  more power over immigration  a role in appointments to the Supreme Court and limitations on federal spending power. They have  however  demurred at Quebec's fifth demand  for the right to veto further constitutional changes. When Meech Lake failed  Mr Bourassa said that he would do no more haggling. But he has talked at length by telephone to fellow premiers. One was Clyde Wells of Newfoundland: he helped block the accord two years ago but no longer resists the idea of letting Quebec take special measures to preserve its status as a distinct society. Last week Mr Bourassa toured the four western provinces. In British Columbia and Saskatchewan he found common round with two premiers  both New Democrats  who have won power since Meech Lake. In Alberta and Manitoba the going was tougher. Alberta's premier  Donald Getty  refuses to make a deal unless it includes reform of Canada's Senate. He argues that a ""triple-E"" Senate (one that is Elected and Effective  with Equal numbers of seats for each province) would redress the balance in a federation that gives too much power to Ontario and Quebec. But it is  therefore  the last thing Mr Bourassa could sell his voters. Quebec has 24 seats in the present appointed Senate; in a triple-E Senate the provinces might get eight seats each. For Mr Clark  Senate reform and the woes of Quebec are now only two worries out of many. The Beaudoin-Dobbie report accepted the ""inherent right to self-government"" of Canada's native peoples. Though Mr Clark and the native leaders claim impressive progress in fashioning a ""third order of government""  this right is proving difficult to translate into practice. There is disagreement  too  about the appropriate devolution of powers from Ottawa to the provinces  and on a ""social charter"" for which Bob Rae  Ontario's premier and another New Democrat  has crusaded. ONE REFERENDUM OR THREE? Mr Clark hopes to publish an offer by early June  at which point Brian Mulroney  the prime minister  would like a meeting of all premiers to apply the final touches. But Mr Mulroney is also preparing an escape route. The government is tabling legislation that would empower it to hold a Canada-wide referendum in late summer. That could be a neat way to prevent the three provinces committed to a referendum (Quebec  Alberta and British Columbia) from having to march separately to the polls  though any constitutional changes involving the Senate or the Supreme Court could still be vetoed by a single province. Most Canadians are more optimistic that the country will hold together than they were a year or even six months ago. Yet nothing is certain. Mr Bourassa  having been robbed once of a promised agreement  at Meech Lake  will recommend nothing to Quebeckers unless he is sure that it will stick. His own position in Quebec may have been made a bit easier by the revelation that Claude Morin  the leading strategist and second minister of the Parti Quebecois in Rene Levesque's government from 1976  was a paid informer for the Mounties  the federal police. Yet some in his own party  notably its youth wing  have not shifted from the sweeping demands to take powers from Ottawa that the party approved last year. Quebec is no more solid than the ROC.""","Never let anybody make you minister for Canada 's constitution . Canadians have a bad habit of setting themselves constitutional deadlines . When they miss them , tempers flare . They made this mistake two years ago , when not enough provinces would ratify a constitutional rearrangement ( the infamous Meech Lake accord "" ) that would have made Quebec happy to remain part of the federation . Now   maddeningly   they are at it again . When Meech Lake collapsed   Quebec 's premier   Robert Bourassa   stalked off in a huff . Quebec 's National Assembly then gave him until the end of this October to decide by referendum whether the 7 m mainly French - speaking Quebeckers should split off from the mainly English - speaking ROC ( as the Rest of Canada now calls itself ) . Mr Bourassa has until August 4th to announce the form of the referendum question . He can either ask voters whether they want political sovereignty   or to accept or turn down a "" binding offer "" from the federal government and the other nine provinces . To date   no such offer is on the table . Joe Clark   the federal minister for the constitution   is striving to assemble an offer in time for Mr Bourassa . A complication is that two provinces -- Alberta and British Columbia -- say they will need to hold referendums of their own to get their voters ' approval to make the offer . For the past month Mr Clark and other ministers from the ROC have been skipping between cities   taking for debate different parts of the Beaudoin - Dobbie parliamentary report on the constitution published in March . After three cities the ROC ministers had accepted four parts of the original Meech Lake accord . These would give Quebec recognition as a distinct society   more power over immigration   a role in appointments to the Supreme Court and limitations on federal spending power . They have   however   demurred at Quebec 's fifth demand   for the right to veto further constitutional changes . When Meech Lake failed   Mr Bourassa said that he would do no more haggling . But he has talked at length by telephone to fellow premiers . One was Clyde Wells of Newfoundland : he helped block the accord two years ago but no longer resists the idea of letting Quebec take special measures to preserve its status as a distinct society . Last week Mr Bourassa toured the four western provinces . In British Columbia and Saskatchewan he found common round with two premiers   both New Democrats   who have won power since Meech Lake . In Alberta and Manitoba the going was tougher . Alberta 's premier   Donald Getty   refuses to make a deal unless it includes reform of Canada 's Senate . He argues that a "" triple - E "" Senate ( one that is Elected and Effective   with Equal numbers of seats for each province ) would redress the balance in a federation that gives too much power to Ontario and Quebec . But it is   therefore   the last thing Mr Bourassa could sell his voters . Quebec has 24 seats in the present appointed Senate ; in a triple - E Senate the provinces might get eight seats each . For Mr Clark   Senate reform and the woes of Quebec are now only two worries out of many . The Beaudoin - Dobbie report accepted the "" inherent right to self - government "" of Canada 's native peoples . Though Mr Clark and the native leaders claim impressive progress in fashioning a "" third order of government ""   this right is proving difficult to translate into practice . There is disagreement   too   about the appropriate devolution of powers from Ottawa to the provinces   and on a "" social charter "" for which Bob Rae   Ontario 's premier and another New Democrat   has crusaded . ONE REFERENDUM OR THREE ? Mr Clark hopes to publish an offer by early June   at which point Brian Mulroney   would like a meeting of all premiers to apply the final touches . But Brian Mulroney is also preparing an escape route . The government is tabling legislation that would empower it to hold a Canada - wide referendum in late summer . That could be a neat way to prevent the three provinces committed to a referendum ( Quebec   Alberta and British Columbia ) from having to march separately to the polls   though any constitutional changes involving the Senate or the Supreme Court could still be vetoed by a single province . Most Canadians are more optimistic that the country will hold together than they were a year or even six months ago . Yet nothing is certain . Mr Bourassa   having been robbed once of a promised agreement   at Meech Lake   will recommend nothing to Quebeckers unless he is sure that it will stick . His own position in Quebec may have been made a bit easier by the revelation that Claude Morin   the leading strategist and second minister of the Parti Quebecois in Rene Levesque 's government from 1976   was a paid informer for the Mounties   the federal police .

He and George Bush had much to talk about, including their attendance at the Rio Earth Summit and the usual niggling trade frictions between their countries. In all likelihood, however, they talked mostly about the state of the proposed North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), which will extend to Mexico the benefits of the four-year-old American-Canadian free-trade area.
The week before Mr Mulroney's visit, the NAFTA working parties had met in plenary session in Toronto. Certain sticking points--the amount of local content required for cars, the possibility of foreign investment in Mexico's constitutionally protected energy industry--are hardy perennials; tough bargaining still lies ahead. But there is a palpable sense of optimism that a text will be agreed upon before the autumn. Mr Bush will probably present the treaty to Congress shortly before the November elections. He will not expect Congress to vote on the text this year, but in politically important border states like Texas, keen on free trade with Mexico, he will be able to claim that he has done his bit for their interests.
If a free-trade agreement is concluded next year, it will be a triumph not only for the government of Carlos Salinas de Gortari, which has opened Mexico's economy to the world, but also for Mr Bush. Many American presidents have talked of free trade with Mexico; none before Mr Bush has done much about it. His own interest in Mexico, and his ability to work closely with Mr Salinas, have helped to put relations between the two countries on their best footing for nearly 30 years.
In Ronald Reagan's day, the continent south of the Rio Grande seemed less a neighbour than a threat--whether because of drugs, or debt, or (in central America) because the Reagan administration was convinced it had to stop Soviet designs on the hemisphere. Early in Mr Bush's term the administration, led by Congress, decided to end support for the rebels in Nicaragua. Then, in June 1990 (two weeks after Mr Salinas and Mr Bush declared their intention of negotiating a free-trade pact), the administration tried to put policy on a new footing by unveiling the Enterprise for the Americas Initiative (EAI).
The EAI was designed to encourage economic liberalisation in the hemisphere by promising reforming countries free trade with the United States. It was also intended to ease new investment with, for example, funds from the Inter-American Development Bank (IDB) to assist privatisation. And it promised continuing relief from debt burdens in exchange for economic reform, including reducing the burden of American foreign-aid loans in exchange for a commitment by the borrowers to do more for the environment.
The United States has now signed ""framework agreements"", setting out mutual agendas for free trade, that cover 31 cowntries. Only Cuba, Suriname and Haiti are left out in the cold. In the case of Chile, the administration has gone further. When Patricio Aylwin, the president of Chile, visited Washington on May 13th, Mr Bush said that the United States intends to negotiate a ""comprehensive free-trade agreement with Chile"" once the NAFTA is completed.
Congress is less enthusiastic. Caught both by budgetary constraints on ""new"" programmes and by the usual wrangling over foreign aid, it has given the EAI little support. A mere $300m, intended to go to a multilateral investment fund run by the IDB, was never appropriated. The administration did not get congressional approval for all the debt relief it sought in fiscal 1992; in fiscal 1993 it may well get nothing at all.
There are signs, too, that the EAI may be surfacing as a political issue in the United States. In hearings on trade policy before the Democratic Party's platform committee recently, a representative of the International Ladies Garment Workers Union--the leading textile union--lumped the EAI with the NAFTA as a means ""purely and simply of further export of much needed jobs"" from the United States. And what is the United States getting in return?
As the chart on the previous page shows, the proportion of American exports that goes to other countries in the hemisphere is well down from its levels between 1950 and 1960. (Chart omitted) Exports to Canada now account for much more than half of the total. In 1991 they were worth $85.1 billion, compared with $63.3 billion for the rest of the hemisphere; and of the latter figure, 52% went to Mexico. Exports from the United States to Latin America may be booming (they leapt 16.6% by value in 1991 over 1990, compared with 5% for all other parts of the world); but, outside Mexico, Latin American markets for American goods are small. The United States exports more by value to Hong Kong and Singapore than it does to Brazil.
In short, without an administration determined to push for a new view of the hemisphere--and many observers think the men around Mr Bush are losing their enthusiasm for the EAI--a revisionist approach might take root. Such an approach would accept that the American and Canadian economies are deeply intertwined and that ties with Mexico should be closer. But revisionists would then point out that incomes in Latin America are still small, that growth is slower than it is in Asia, that drugs will continue to pour in from the south, and that not every country on the continent is a model of stablity. The United States may have some interests there; but are these vital enough to risk the loss of political capital at home?","On May 19th Brian Mulroney arrived in Washington for two days of meetings .

True, the Canadian referendum does not ask whether the voters want Canada to stay as one or to split; it asks whether they approve of the constitutional deal agreed on by the prime minister, Brian Mulroney, and the ten premiers of Canada's provinces in Charlottetown, Prince Edward Island, on August 28th. All the signs are that they do not. Never mind that the premier of tempted-to-quit Quebec was one of those present in Charlottetown. Never mind that other leaders representing Canada's territories and native peoples also signed the agreement. Never mind that all three of Canada's national parties are campaigning for a Yes. Opinion polls suggest that in Alberta, British Columbia and Quebec most voters will say No. And even if the rest of the country votes Yes in big enough numbers to ensure a national majority for approval, a No from any one province means the deal will be dead.
In which case, Canada may die with it. A bit melodramatic? Perhaps: nothing is ever final in Canada, least of all constitutional debate, a pastime that has almost become the defining national characteristic. Certainly, nobody ever thought the Charlottetown agreement would bring argy-bargy to an end. The most optimistic claim was that it would produce a constitution to last into the next century. Accordingly, its collapse may be regarded by some as of no great consequence: no more serious, say, than the collapse of its predecessor, Meech Lake, in 1990. Despite predictions then that Quebec would flounce out, it did not. Instead, the death of Meech Lake has meant two extra years of fun for Canada's folkloric constitutionalists.
That is the case for calm. The case for alarm is as simple: if Canadians cannot agree on Charlottetown, it is hard to see them agreeing on anything else. The merit of this latest deal is that it has something for everyone. Quebec has won recognition as a ""distinct society"" and gained lots of protections for its Frenchness. The west has won the abolition of the existing appointed Senate and its replacement by an elected one in which each province will have an equal number of seats. Indians have won ""the inherent right of self-government"". So long as Canadians look at Charlottetown's advantages rather than its drawbacks, and are prepared to put the common good before the individual good, the deal could prove reasonably durable.
Unfortunately, Canadians no longer look at things that way. Indeed, many of them no longer look at themselves primarily as Canadians. Rather they see themselves as members of interest groups. They are women or environmentalists or natives or Francophones or disabled or members of some other self-defined minority. Each group has fought to have its claims recognised in the new constitutional order. That is why the Charlottetown document is concerned not so much with ""blue"" rights (freedom of speech, the right to vote, etc) as with ""red"" ones (full employment is enshrined as a policy goal), ""green"" ones (development is to be sustainable), and a rainbow of other rights reflecting the need for ""gender equality"" in the Senate, self-government for groups of Indians who will evidently be defined by race rather than geography, and quixotic commitments to ""the vitality and development of official language minority communities throughout Canada"".
SAUCE FOR THE LOON, POISON FOR THE LOONIES
With all this included in Charlottetown, you might think everyone would be happy. But if you are an interest group, you can never get enough, and lots of them still want more. Moreover, sauce for the goose tends to be poison for the gander: rights for Canada's French-speaking minority infuriate Quebec's English-speaking minority. Add to that the near-universal unpopularity of Mr Mulroney, and a consequent reluctance to give him anything that might be regarded as a success, and you have the makings of a majority for the Noes.
The current mess shows the consequences of treating people as members of minorities with special rights rather than as people, all of whom should have the same rights. This habit took hold in Canada in the 1980s when Pierre Trudeau brought home Canada's constitution, the British North America Act, which had lain in London serving its purpose rather well since the country was formed in 1867. At the same time he introduced a charter of rights and freedoms, which brought collective rights all round as well as individual ones. Mr Trudeau now advocates a No vote on October 26th. If enough people take his advice and Canada breaks up, the rest of the world may not mind, or even notice; but those Canadians who would rather be citizens of a country than members of a cluster of interest groups will feel he has a lot to answer for.","When Americans go to the polls on November 3rd , they may get a new president . When Canadians vote eight days earlier , they may get a new country -- or countries . 
 True , the Canadian referendum does not ask whether the voters want Canada to stay as one or to split ; it asks whether they approve of the constitutional deal agreed on by Brian Mulroney , and the ten premiers of Canada 's provinces in Charlottetown , Prince Edward Island , on August 28th . All the signs are that they do not . Never mind that the premier of tempted - to - quit Quebec was one of those present in Charlottetown . Never mind that other leaders representing Canada 's territories and native peoples also signed the agreement . Never mind that all three of Canada 's national parties are campaigning for a Yes . Opinion polls suggest that in Alberta , British Columbia and Quebec most voters will say No . And even if the rest of the country votes Yes in big enough numbers to ensure a national majority for approval , a No from any one province means the deal will be dead . 
 In which case , Canada may die with it . A bit melodramatic ?

On October 26th Canadians were invited to approve a package of constitutional changes, carefully negotiated and agreed upon by their political masters. They declined. Six of the ten provinces, plus the Yukon territory, said No. Nationally, the No vote came to 54%. Opinion polls had predicted that the westernmost provinces of British Columbia and Alberta would join Quebec in the No camp. In the event all four western provinces did. And whereas there was a 55% No vote in Quebec, the No in three of those western provinces exceeded 60%.
Canada's poorest provinces--Newfoundland, New Brunswick and Prince Edward Island--voted Yes. So, by a few thousand votes, did Ontario, the most populous province. Nova Scotia voted against. Since the package of changes needed the ratification of every province, as well as the federal government, it could hardly have been killed off more decisively.
After the death comes the post-mortem. It was, said a drinker in Grumpy's Bar in Montreal, ""horrendously Canadian: a populist revolt in favour of the status quo."" Politicians will look for deeper explanations. Yet it was undeniably a revolt by ordinary people against their leaders. When the constitutional package was put together, in Charlottetown in August, all ten provincial premiers as well as the prime minister, Brian Mulroney, and the country's native leaders, put their signatures to it.
They did so only after two years of debate and the most careful balancing of regional claims. Thus French-speaking Quebec was to be confirmed as a ""distinct society"" with enhanced powers, the western provinces would have a bigger share of seats in a reformed Senate and the native peoples would win recognition of their ""inherent"" right to self-government. All in all, the accord struck its architects as a fine way to satisfy Quebec's desire to be itself and to be part of Canada as well.
That was the theory. Now, after a grueling campaign, Canada is at sea and provincial relationships are worse than ever. For westerners, to vote No was to deliver a blow against Ontario and Quebec, the dominant central provinces. For the separatists in Quebec, the West's No was confirmation that Canada would never bring itself to acknowledge Quebec's special character.
Jacques Parizeau, the leader of the opposition Parti Quebecois, leap upon the result to proclaim that Canada had now spurned Quebec three times in a decade, the previous two being in 1992 (when Pierre Trudeau brought in a new constitution without Quebec's approval) and in 1990 (when two provinces refused to ratify the modest addition to Quebec's powers proposed in Mr Mulroney's Meech Lake accord). ""With Meech they said No to Quebec; this time we said No to each other,"" he declared.
There was indeed a good deal of anti-Quebec feeling in western Canada, in rural Ontario and among English-speakers in New Brunswick (where the French-speaking Acadians tipped the vote to Yes). Voters took particular exception to the proposal that Quebec should be guaranteed a quarter of the seats in the House of Commons in perpetuity, even if its population were to fall below a quarter of Canada's total.
But Quebeckers are not the only victims. Native leaders, too, felt rejected by the rest of Canada. They were quick to denounce the No votes from Alberta and British Columbia as an attempt by these provinces to avoid settling hue native land claims. This was probably part of the explanation (the other part being the frustrations of a depressed economy) for a heavy No vote in northern Ontario as well. There have been warnings that the violent Mohawk protests of two years ago may now resume.
After the post-mortem, politics has to continue. In Quebec Mr Parizeau construes the No vote as a green light for sovereignty. Yet a dash for separation is not necessarily imminent. Declared separatists still make up only one-third of Quebec's electorate. The province's No was clinched by federalists in the Liberal Party who would stay in Canada if Quebec got more powers than Charlottetown offered.
Moreover, Robert Bourassa, Quebec's Liberal premier, lives to fight another day. Hurt by suggestions that he had ""caved in"" when negotiating the Charlottetown package, he nonetheless campaigned stoutly, winning a handsome Yes in his own constituency. On referendum night he said he would continue ""to build Quebec within Canada"". Having discharged his promise that Quebeckers would have a referendum, he has two years before having to face Mr Parizeau in an election. The separatist danger in Quebec may now be smaller than that in British Columbia, the fastest growing and most isolated province.
In Ottawa Mr Mulroney, the chief architect of both the Meech and the Charlottetown accords, is in the tightest spot of all. His famed campaigning skills, seasoned with Irish-Quebecois oratory, failed to prevent a humiliating defeat. His value to the Conservatives as a bride between Quebeckers and westerners has been diminished. Yet he faces no open challenge from within his party. Joe Clark, the constitutional-affairs minister, is exhausted after 18 months of hard and profitless work.
The prime minister has a few more months to decide whether to lead his party into the general election he has to call by November 1993, or whether to make way for a leadership convention. One sop to the West might be to stand down in favour of Kim Campbell, his lively justice minister from Vancouver. In the meantime, his government's efforts to sort out the constitution have been comprehensively stymied, with no further initiatives in sight.

They blamed the rest of Canada for rejecting a deal that would, among other things, have provided a quick path to native self-government. Small irony: 62% of those natives on reserves who turned out voted No too.
Most Canadians acknowledge that the aboriginal people have had a rotten deal. In the prairies and Ontario, much land was given up by the Indians in the 19th century in a series of one-sided treaties. Elsewhere, the government simply took possession of the land and gave it to white settlers, or leased it to forestry and mining companies. Across Canada natives were usually provided with reserves, land owned by the state but set aside as homelands for the preservation of traditional ways of life.
Aboriginals still have large land claims. But other Canadians rule out handing over vast tracts of land, and the courts seem to agree. A British Columbia judge ruled last year that aboriginal title to 22,000 square miles (57,000 square kilometres) of the province had been extinguished by the simple fact of colonial rule. Though this ruling is now under appeal, the province and its natives have agreed to negotiate a compromise, presumably entailing less land and more money in compensation.
In Ontario, a court has rejected native claims to 3,900 square miles of valuable timberland. The court ruled that even if the natives' ancestors were not part of a group that had ceded the land in the 1850s, the natives had given up rights to the land by accepting federal money and reserves from the federal government.
Canada is more receptive to the natives' desire for self-government than their desire for land. At present, natives on reserves are governed under the intensive and much-despised Indian Act. The Charlottetown deal acknowledged their ""inherent right to self-government"", while making it clear that this implied a third order of government alongside the national and provincial governments. But many natives thought this would block the way to full nationhood. Others disliked a vague proviso that laws passed by natives would have to conform with ""peace, order and good government"".
Among native peoples, only the Inuit (formerly known as Eskimos) voted overwhelmingly in favour of Charlottetown. They have just voted on a huge land offer, covering 135,000 square miles in the eastern Arctic, including limited self-government and a federal grant of C$1.15 billion ($0.9 billion) over 14 years. Did the other natives make a mistake in voting No?
Yes or No, Canada was never likely to agree to the emergence of a multitude of independent nations inside its territory. But a Yes to Charlottetown would have brought forward by years the process by which aboriginals could control their own schools, child-care programmes, laws over marriage and divorce, and other powers that are now out of their hands.
Some version of ""empowerment"" is clearly needed. The third of native Canadians who live on reserves are the poorest people in the country, with unemployment of up to 70%, and infant-mortality and suicide rates that are twice as high as those of non-natives. Many look to the treaties of the 18th century for salvation. These promised a set area of land per Indian inhabitant, and in some cases the government has failed to expand the reserves to keep up.
Many reserves are on useless land: the waters on the Akwesasne Mohawk reserve straddling Ontario, Quebec and New York state are polluted by an up-river factory. It makes sense to get rid of some existing reserves, and let natives buy good land for a fresh start. Brian Mulroney, Canada's prime minister, did exactly that in Saskatchayan during the referendum campaign, at a cost of C$500,000.

The regime is said to have agreed, albeit vaguely, to the first stage of a United Nations proposal. This would allow a group of international observers to be based in the country. The idea is that their presence would curb human-rights abuses, restore stability and lead to an agreement under which Mr Aristide would be allowed to return to the (unoccupied) presidency so long as he had a prime minister from one of the parties opposed to him.

By-elections on January 18th, held in defiance of international objections and boycotted by Mr Aristide's party, have not helped.

Almost singlehanded, he has jawboned his colleagues in the cabinet to promise that work will go ahead so that in 1997 oil can start being pumped from the Hibernia field, some 315 kilometres (nearly 200 miles) out in ""iceberg alley"" off St John's, Newfoundland's capital. Commentators in Toronto have said the project is doomed, and likely to produce the most expensive oil on the planet. Mr Crosbie says that this way of looking at things is ""shallow, callow and uncaring"".
In September 1990 Brian Mulroney's government offered federal subsidies of C$2.7 billion ($2.3 billion) for developing the Hibernia field to a consortium of four oil companies, one of which dropped out last February. The government, unable to find a replacement, has now decided to buy itself an 8.5% share in the project; it has also promised to buy another 6.5% share if the owner drops out. Concrete will soon start flowing into a huge drilling platform being built in a pit near Great Mosquito Cove. With the unemployment rate in Newfoundland at nearly 21%, this will be a big relief to 1,000 engineers and tradesmen.
There may be 525m barrels waiting to be pumped out of Hibernia over 18 years. They will be profitable at some price above $20 a barrel. Since the price is now $17, it is a risky investment. By analogy with the North Sea, some argue that one productive oil project leads quickly to another, so Hibernia's success would speed up production from neighbouring discoveries. Western Canada's oil fields will be running out in about 15 years, when Hibernia could be going strong.
Provincial considerations seem to have weighed more than economics with the cabinet. Since Newfoundland joined Canada in 1949, it has constantly sought replacements for the declining fish and paper businesses. Young people tend to leave. About half of what the Newfoundland government spends comes as federal payments from richer provinces.
The federal government has backed several dud schemes to help Newfoundland (it once put up a loan of C$20m for growing cucumbers). But Hibernia is its biggest bet yet. Even if it works, it will not provide many jobs for locals, and the money it bring in will be docked from Newfoundland's federal subsidies. But maybe Newfoundlanders prefer to live off their own resources. And, needless to say, a federal election is due this year--even if Mr Crosbie, and perhaps even Mr Mulroney himself, are unlikely to fight it.","Everybody gets lucky once , even Canada 's poorest province , Newfoundland , and its booster , John Crosbie , long a minister of this or that in the Conservative federal government .

The mission's job is supposed to be to help to restore democracy, no less.
So far there are only 40 monitors, though there may be 500 eventually. Once they are in place, the UN plan calls for talks to negotiate the return to power of President Jean-Bertrand Aristide, the radical Catholic priest who won the election in December 1990 but was forced into exile by a military coup seven months later.
An earlier set of observers sent to Haiti by the Organisation of American States ran into trouble. They were not allowed to leave the capital and few of them could speak Creole. As a result, many of them seemed to spend their time at the swimming pool. The UN and the OAS want to get it right this time. They are offering $6,000-a-month salaries to attract better-qualified people.
Haiti's prime minister, Marc Bazin, backed by the generals who led the military coup, had done what he could to keep the observers out. Earlier this month he insisted on impossible conditions, such as denying them the right of free movement across the country. The American response was swift and firm-the first coherent message to come from the White House on policy towards Haiti in months. President Bill Clinton declared his commitment to the restoration of democracy and, together with Canada's prime minister, Brian Mulroney, said tough action would follow if Haiti did not let the observers in on reasonable terms. Mr Bazin quickly backed down.
There are signs that the current clique of military rulers and their civilian collaborators could be losing their appetite for power. They may sense that time is running out for them and that this might be the moment to strike a deal. They have taken in the fact that the presence of the observers is meant not only to protect Mr Aristide's supporters but also to ensure the military men's own future protection from a people they have brutalised for the past year and a half.
Mr Aristide has softened his previously vengeful tone towards the army. He has dropped his demand that officers should be tried, and now leaves open the option of gilded dismissals and possible visas to Miami, the home of other disgraced Haitians. If he maintains this conciliatory stance, it may help to create the climate for a return of democracy, with himself in charge.
America's new-found clarity in its dealings with Mr Bazin does not extend to other aspects of Haitian policy. Efforts to handle visa applications in Port-au-Prince have largely failed. More troubling is the handling of more than 200 Haitians who have been quarantined for the past year at the American naval base at Guantanamo Bay in Cuba. All have legitimate fears of persecution if returned to Haiti but they have not been allowed to apply for asylum because they have tested positive for the AIDS virus.
The refugees are now in the third week of a hunger strike meant to draw attention to their plight. Most are very weak. Jesse Jackson, the black activist who has run a couple of times for the American presidency, has now joined the hunger strike to protest against conditions on what he calls ""leprosy island"".
Administration officials confirmed last week that Mr Clinton intends to fulfil his campaign pledge to lift the ban on HIV-infected foreigners entering the United States. The Haitians at Guantanamo, because they are already on an American base, could probably be admitted without much ado to the mainland. But White House insiders say that the fear of opposition from conservative Republicans in Congress, which might give rise to an outcry similar to the one over letting homosexuals join the army, will keep Mr Clinton from acting soon.","After much arm-twisting, the first group of human-rights observers was allowed into Haiti last week under a plan brokered by the United Nations.

On February 24th Brian Mulroney told his party that he was stepping down after more than eight years as prime minister. The progressive Conservative Party will hold a leadership convention in June, giving time for his successor to settle in before the likely autumn election.
Joe Clark, former prime minister and present constitution minister, had already announced that he would be leaving national politics. Meanwhile, Robert Bourassa, who has been premier of Quebec (off and on) since 1970, is seriously ill and is expected to resign soon, rather than stay and fight a provincial election early next year.
Mr Mulroney's resignation had been rumoured since the government's constitutional proposals were rejected in a national referendum last October. The rumours reached such a pitch a month ago that five possible successors (including two women: the defence minister, Kim Campbell, and the external-affairs minister, Barbara McDougall) began preparing for a leadership convention. But Mr Mulroney, as late as February 19th, was telling the House of Commons: ""I feel as young as a spring flower.""
What has made this youngish prime minister, only 54 next month, suddenly turn around and walk out of the door? Recent opinion polls from Quebec, his home province, have shown the Conservatives far behind the Liberals and the separatist Bloc Quebecois. Nationally, the Conservatives have lagged 20 points behind Jean Chretien's federal Liberal Party for more than a year. They have regained some round from the populist Reform Party in western Canada, but that gain is more the achievement of Mr Clark, who comes from Alberta, than of the prime minister, who is no more popular there than elsewhere in Canada.
Another factor was certainly Mr Clark's prior announcement that, after 21 years, he was leaving federal politics (at an equally young age). Had Mr Clark stayed on he would have been available as a new prime minister and leader of the Conservative party. Mr Mulroney might not have risked the ignominy of handing over to the man he displaced in 1983, even though Mr Clark has served under him loyally since then.
Mr Mulroney is a radical politician who was not trusted. He pushed through painful economic changes against widespread opposition, first by taking Canada into a free-trade agreement with the United States, and then by signing the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) which draws Mexico in as third party. The proposed agreement with the United States became the main issue in the 1988 election. The two opposition parties attacked it bitterly.
With only 42% of the vote, Mr Mulroney won the election and went ahead to sin the agreement. According to trade-union figures, 350,000 jobs in manufacturing industry were lost in the subsequent three years, as manufacturers closed factories, reduced the number of people they employed or left Canada altogether. Though some of this devastation was due to the recession and industrial adjustment, the free-trade agreement certainly aggravated the trend. Many Canadians expect NAFTA to carry the demolition of Canada's manufacturing industry further, especially in Ontario.
On top of this, the Mulroney government took extreme measures, including packing the Senate with extra members, in order to introduce a goods-and-services tax. Despite the handsome amount of revenue harvested by this most unpopular tax, the government has failed to reduce the deficit as promised and faces another year of unemployment above 11%. In these circumstances, the man who is seen as a principal author of these misfortunes would almost certainly have faced humiliation at the polls. His virtues--a passion to keep Canada united, and a concern for human rights around the world--have been obscured.
There is no obvious successor, although Ms Campbell is seen as the front-runner: a bilingual woman from western Canada would give a bright new face to the Conservatives. She won a fine reputation as justice minister, and may build on it after her recent sideways move to a dual portfolio of defence and veterans' affairs. This gives her powers over $C14 billion ($11 billion) of spending, as well as a flow of publicity earned by the 4,700 Canadian troops on peacekeeping duties abroad.
Barbara McDougall has not fared so well at external affairs, and will be competing for support with Michael Wilson, a cabinet heavyweight as finance minister and more recently in charge of international trade. Perrin Beatty, the communications minister popular with the party's right wing, may do well. The party is unlikely to choose another Quebecker immediately after Mr Mulroney, but Jean Charest, the personable environment minister, could form an alliance with Ms Campbell that would knit together east and west. It is conceivable that Mr Clark will be tempted to re-enter the political arena. But, after early setbacks in his long career, he may not have the stomach for such a risky comeback.
Mr Bourassa has skin cancer and has been receiving experimental treatment from a hospital in the United States. He will not turn 60 until July and keeps fit with a daily swim. But the next election campaign is shaping into a bitter contest. His Liberal Party is opposed by the Parti Quebecois, whose leader, Jacques Parizeau, promises to make Quebec sovereign by mid-1995. Mr Bourassa will have to decide after a medical progress report in March whether he has the strength for this fight. The departure of Mr Mulroney, a strong ally in the federalist cause, may further weaken his resolve.","As elections approach in Canada , the familiar faces are beginning to fade away .

Their choice lies between the ruling Australian Labor Party of Paul Keating, whose economic reforms have brought them high unemployment and falling real wages, and the Liberal-National Party coalition of John Hewson, who promises still more reforms plus a tax on virtually everything they buy. A plague on both their shonky houses, as an Aussie Mercutio might have said.
The disgruntlement is easier to explain than to justify. Generations of Australians have lived beyond their means. At the start of this century, they were the world's richest people; now they have slipped to the 18th rung of the OECD ladder. Yet their standard of living has defied the statistical slide: Australians still take for granted the endless space, big houses, swimming pools, cold beer and chilled chardonnay. Japanese tourists, jetting into Cairns from their Tokyo rabbit hutches, are apt to gasp in amazement. It adds up to a mismatch between effort and reward that has been reconciled by borrowing around $116 billion--more per person than any other country in the world.
A DIFFERENT DIET
Back in 1986 Mr Keating famously warned Australians that their country risked becoming ""a banana republic"". He drew attention to that risk, both as treasurer (finance minister) in the governments of Bob Hawke--whom he deposed last year--and then as prime minister, to try to instil in Australians the economic disciplines that they so conspicuously lacked. The method was a mix of deregulation, fiscal rectitude and privatisation that was almost Thatcherite, and certainly at odds with Labor's traditions. Amazingly, the party faithful kept the faith. So, too, did the unions: their ""accord"" with the government held wage inflation in check. The voters may not have liked the medicine but they knew it was for Australia's good: since 1983 they have voted Labor into office for four consecutive terms.
Whether they now give Labor a fifth chance is as likely to be decided by campaign insults as by economic judgment--hence Mr Keating's description of Mr Hewson, a former economics professor, as a ""feral abacus"". Hence, too, Mr Keating's decision to tap the rich vein of Australian populism. Last week he pledged to hold a referendum on whether Australia should junk Queen Elizabeth as head of state and celebrate its federal centenary in 2001 as a republic. Meanwhile, he describes Mr Hewson's proposed 15% goods and services tax (GST) as a ""monster"", ignoring the opposition's plan to balance it with cuts in income tax and the abolition of several other taxes.
Such attacks make their mark. Mr Hewson is already limiting the scope of his GST, for example by exempting food; he knows that the introduction of a similar tax in Canada has done nothing for the popularity of Canada's prime minister, Brian Mulroney, who announced his resignation last week. As insult follows insult, the opinion polls give Labor a fighting chance of retaining office, despite a series of defeats in state elections and a national unemployment rate of over 10%. Evidently the ordinary voter finds the choices uninspiring.
The two main parties certainly seem to have a lot in common. Both Labor and the Liberals have a similar analysis of Australia's woes, and broadly the same remedy: the country must become a skilled, productive exporter to a market of 2 billion consumers around the Pacific. Yet Labor may deserve some credit for its apparently bleak stewardship of the economy. Mr Keating, after presiding over ""the recession Australia had to have"", has brought the country to the point where it should soon enjoy one of the highest growth rates in the developed world: inflation is a mere 0.3%; industrial output is over 3% higher than a year ago; and real interest rates are among the lowest in the OECD. The question, made pressing by the burdens of unemployment and foreign debt (most of it is owed by the private sector), is what next?
Mr Keating's answer is a fiscal stimulus and further opening of the economy to market forces. Mr Hewson would do that and more, by deregulating fast at the local level; by abolishing tariffs; and by letting the GST encourage a savings habit and so reduce he foreign debt. Neither programme suggests that Australia's reputation as the lucky country will enable it to avoid hard work and hard choices. In this, the leaders of both parties are departing from the practices of their predecessors. For too long politicians allowed Australians to indulge in make-believe. Now, however austere the outlook may appear, at least the voters can make their choice between realistic alternatives. Whatever the predictions of Singapore's Lee Kuan Yew, Australians do not have to end up as ""Asia's poor white trash"".","Democracy is a compulsory affair down under, so forgive Australia's voters if on March 13th they drag their feet on the way to the polls. Their choice lies between the ruling Australian Labor Party of Paul Keating, whose economic reforms have brought them high unemployment and falling real wages, and the Liberal-National Party coalition of John Hewson, who promises still more reforms plus a tax on virtually everything they buy. A plague on both their shonky houses, as an Aussie Mercutio might have said.
The disgruntlement is easier to explain than to justify. Generations of Australians have lived beyond their means. At the start of this century, they were the world's richest people; now they have slipped to the 18th rung of the OECD ladder. Yet their standard of living has defied the statistical slide: Australians still take for granted the endless space, big houses, swimming pools, cold beer and chilled chardonnay. Japanese tourists, jetting into Cairns from their Tokyo rabbit hutches, are apt to gasp in amazement. It adds up to a mismatch between effort and reward that has been reconciled by borrowing around $116 billion--more per person than any other country in the world.

Three months ago, when Brian Mulroney announced his intention to retire after more than eight years as prime minister, it looked virtually certain that his successor as Conservative leader would be the bright and effervescent minister of defence, Kim Campbell. This 46-year-old newcomer to federal politics from British Columbia was so far ahead of her colleagues that she seemed bound to win. That at least was the view of many influential Tories worried about who might lead them to victory in the election due later this year.
Now it has all changed, and the likely winner at the party convention on June 13th is a young man from Quebec, Jean Charest, the minister for the environment. Of the five candidates for the leadership, two will get only a handful of votes. A third, James Edwards, can call on the loyalty of the party's right-wingers, particularly from his own Alberta. The view is gaining ground that, if Ms Campbell does not win more than 40% of the delegates' votes on the first ballot, Mr Charest will take the crown with the help of Mr Edwards's backers.
Why the decline in Ms Campbell's fortunes? Her French is adequate, but Canada's French-speakers naturally prefer the bilingual Mr Charest. At 34, Mr Charest has the edge in youthfulness. And the tart-tongued, photogenic Ms Campbell has clumsily, and unexpectedly, stumbled. She has made a wooden impression in televised debates. She has stoutly defended the acquisition, for C$5.8 billion ($4.6 billion), of 50 naval helicopters, while arguing that she wants to reduce the budget deficit. She has defended the Mulroney government, whereas Mr Charest has discreetly distanced himself from the old regime.
Most damagingly, Ms Campbell has not heeded the wartime warning recalled by mariners in Newfoundland and Nova Scotia as they marked last month's 50th anniversary of victory in the Battle of the Atlantic: ""Loose lips sink ships."" What she explains as the free manner of speech of West Coast Canadians, which would probably go down quite well in the United States, has raised Canadian eyebrows. In closing one television debate she angered critics of the government's economic policies by calling them ""enemies of Canadians"". In a magazine interview she managed to upset Catholics by referring to ""the evil demons of the papacy"", insult some would-be Tory leaders of the past, and raise doubts by making dubious claims about her command of several languages, including Yiddish and German.
The amiable Mr Charest has, in Gilbertian style, said nothing in particular and said it very well. He has been quietly eroding the Campbell lead by speeding around Canada to meet delegates in some 270 constituencies. He has shown himself as a devoted family man; Ms Campbell is twice divorced and childless.
Ms Campbell has a good lead over Mr Charest in delegates who have declared their commitment, but is well short of the 1,900 needed for a first-ballot win. In the end, it may come down to who makes the better speech at the convention--and who the delegates believe can beat the Liberals in the election, probably in September. The only opinion poll on this, so far, has favoured Mr Charest. The Liberals' strategists, after panicking about Campbellmania, are now praying for her to become Tory leader. Their spirits are high after Liberal victories in three provincial elections this spring, including the ejection of the Tories from office in Nova Scotia after 15 years. They fear that Mr Charest, but not Ms Campbell, will be a match for them in the provinces where it matters most, Quebec and Ontario.","Never say Canada can not produce unexpected changes , even if the change turns out to have a rather Canadian twist .

The oranisation she gathered together six months ago propelled her through a lacklustre campaign and kept her just ahead (53% of the 3,447 delegates) of the late-hour challenge from her young Quebec colleague, Jean Charest, at the party convention on June 13th. She has far less time--probably only two months--to pull the Tory party together and put a fresh look on an unpopular government before heading into a general election.
She will be facing four parties that matter at that election, instead of the usual two, and the timing is tight. There are good reasons for holding the election before the end of October; otherwise an expensive new count of voters will be required. October itself is a cluttered month. So she may well decide to announce in mid-August an election that would take place in late September.
Her most specific pledge so far has been to eliminate the federal deficit, which is stuck at C$32 billion ($25 billion), within five years. She will begin her plan for restructuring the Federal government by cutting the cabinet from 35 to 25 members. Since nearly all the senior Mulroney ministers plan to leave politics at the next election, she has virtually a clean slate.
She will find it harder to carry out her still secret plan to trim and merge government departments. Canada's civil servants are more rock-like than its politicians, and such changes will take years. She had wanted to hold an immediate federal-provincial summit to co-ordinate economy measures, but only two of the ten premiers are Conservatives and the others have no desire to burnish her image.
So her efforts this summer must concentrate on bringing together the often distinct groups of Tories from western and central Canada, and devising an election strategy. She has to win the loyalty of Mr Charest, her disappointed rival, enticing him with promotion from his environment portfolio; he alone can carry Quebec for the Conservatives in the way Brian Mulroney did. Her reputation as a quick learner and speedy worker is already established. The next weeks will show whether she has both the authority and the personality to weld the party together, a skill in which Mr Mulroney, for all his other faults, excelled.
The Conservatives' traditional opponents are still delighted that Ms Campbell was chosen over Mr Charest. The Liberals believe the opinion polls, which say that she is the easier to defeat. The New Democrat leader, Audrey McLaughlin, welcomes another woman at the top, but sees Ms Campbell as accident-prone, liable to make hasty and combative statements. Both parties are already pinning the record of the Mulroney years on his protege. ""New Tory, same story"" is likely to become an opposition election slogan.","Looking at what lies ahead , being elected leader of the Progressive Conservative Party , and thus taking over from Brian Mulroney as Canada 's prime minister , may come to seem the easy bit to Kim Campbell .

 Her most specific pledge so far has been to eliminate the federal deficit , which is stuck at C$ 32 billion ( $ 25 billion ) , within five years . She will begin her plan for restructuring the Federal government by cutting the cabinet from 35 to 25 members . Since nearly all the senior Brian Mulroney ministers plan to leave politics at the next election , she has virtually a clean slate . 
 She will find it harder to carry out her still secret plan to trim and merge government departments . Canada 's civil servants are more rock - like than its politicians , and such changes will take years . She had wanted to hold an immediate federal - provincial summit to co - ordinate economy measures , but only two of the ten premiers are Conservatives and the others have no desire to burnish her image . 
 So her efforts this summer must concentrate on bringing together the often distinct groups of Tories from western and central Canada , and devising an election strategy . She has to win the loyalty of Mr Charest , her disappointed rival , enticing him with promotion from his environment portfolio ; he alone can carry Quebec for the Conservatives in the way Brian Mulroney did . Her reputation as a quick learner and speedy worker is already established . The next weeks will show whether she has both the authority and the personality to weld the party together , a skill in which Brian Mulroney , for all Brian Mulroney's other faults , excelled . 
 The Conservatives ' traditional opponents are still delighted that Ms Campbell was chosen over Mr Charest . The Liberals believe the opinion polls , which say that she is the easier to defeat . The New Democrat leader , Audrey McLaughlin , welcomes another woman at the top , but sees Ms Campbell as accident - prone , liable to make hasty and combative statements . Both parties are already pinning the record of the Brian Mulroney years on Brian Mulroney's protege . "" New Tory , same story "" is likely to become an opposition election slogan .",20,Canada,A29-142,IN TERM,True,Brian Mulroney,7,True

Most Canadian federal elections in the past quarter-century have been decided on the voters' assessment of party leaders. So her test will come within a few weeks, when she embarks on the 47-day campaign for the election that is almost certain to take place before the end of October.
Ms Campbell has been doing her best to suggest a range of differences with Brian Mulroney's government, without repudiating any of its policies--which she could hardly do since she was first his minister of justice, and then of defence. Her answer is a new image, particularly of herself.
Mr Mulroney, prime minister for nine years until he retired in June, was mistrusted and unpopular except in his native Quebec. His efforts to unify Canadians through constitutional reform and to bring jobs through free-trade agreements were judged a failure. As defence minister, Ms Campbell herself had to defend the purchase of 50 military helicopters costing C$5.8 billion ($4.5 billion).
With the open look of a healthy blonde, she has reflected the sunny mood of summertime Canada. She has avoided controversial issues, preferring to be interviewed by disc jockeys than by political pundits. She has kept photographers busy with her cheerful hats, and she pitched a baseball competently. Flitting across Canada--on national day, July 1st, she greeted the dawn in Newfoundland and watched the sunset in her own British Colombia--she has shed some of her elitist skin. Mr Mulroney used to travel in limousines, but she took the subway in Toronto and walked the streets of Regina when paying a call on two provincial premiers. While the Mulroneys were furnishing their new mansion in Montreal with whirlpools in every bathroom and trying to sell their prime-ministerial furniture to the government, she was telling radio-show audiences that she had not even bought linen for her official residence.
As a first move towards fulfilling her promise--made when she was fighting for the party leadership--to eliminate the present C$32.6 billion federal deficit within five years, she cut the cabinet by eight ministers, and the civil service by nine government departments. She also refused to sign election nomination papers for three Quebec parliamentarians who face charges of misusing public funds; a step designed to appeal to supporters of the Reform Party, which has sprung to influence in western Canada. For Canadian nationalists who maintained that Mr Mulroney was a branch-plant American, Ms Campbell and her external affairs minister, Perrin Beatty, have managed to distance themselves a little: lifting a ban on aid to Cuba, opposing an air strike in Bosnia and holding out against sanctions in Bill Clinton's NAFTA side-deals (see page 21).
The summer has been less kind to Mr Chretien and the New Democrat leader, Audrey McLaughlin. Mr Chretien has been embroiled in squabbles with a dozen constituency associations, accused of using his position to ""parachute"" high-powered names on to the list of Liberal candidates. He was one of Pierre Trudeau's most energetic ministers but now, it seems, his folksy style belongs to an older generation of politics. For her part, Ms McLaughlin stumbled when, on August 11th, she bought an hour of network time for a ""television town-hall meeting"". Her admission that the opening video was made in Washington brought derision on the leader of a party that has vowed to abrogate the free-trade treaty.","In her two months as Canada 's prime minister , Kim Campbell has brought her Progressive Conservative Party within striking distance of the Liberals , led by Jean Chretien .

Now Canadians face a hard-to-forecast general election on October 25th, and a clouded future, whoever wins.
One cloud is political: there will probably be no outright winner. Canada has three major parties, but a first-past-the-post electoral system. So the Conservatives or the Liberals have usually managed to win an overall majority, leaving the New Democrats to play the national conscience, with occasional power in the provinces (as at present in Ontario, British Columbia and Saskatchewan). This year, though, two regional parties are doing well, the separatist Bloc Qubecois and the Alberta-based Reform Party. The best guess is that neither the Conservative prime minister, Kim Campbell, nor the Liberal leader, Jean Chretien, will win a clear majority of the 295 seats. Indeed neither may do better than 120.
This need not be worrying. Minority government is nothing new in Canada, nor need it mean stalemate. Lester Pearson headed two minority Liberal governments in the 1960s that brought in big welfare programmes. Pierre Trudeau had to govern for two years by the grace of the New Democrats, and paid for their support by creating the national oil corporation, Petro-Canada, which brought Canadians inside knowledge of a mainly foreign-owned industry.
Ms Campbell is trying for a third Conservative majority government, but takes pains to call it a first Campbell one, to distance herself from Brian Mulroney, who ended nine years as prime minister in deep unpopularity. In the short time she had before having to call an election, she worked hard on the barbecue circuit to make herself known and liked, but the 47 days of the election campaign will be the test of a relatively untried politician.
She was Mr Mulroney's minister of justice, and then of defence, for less than four years. Mr Chretien, in contrast, held almost all the important portfolios under Mr Trudeau. But few younger voters know or care. As one pollster put it this week, the choice is between a fresh leader with a tired party and a tired leader with a fresh party.
Ms Campbell is trying to get rid of one albatross, or rather seven, inherited from her own defence-ministry past. On September 2nd she announced she would cut from 50 to 43 the number of helicopters that Canada is to buy, still laden with equipment to spot Soviet submarines. Supposedly, this will save C$1 billion ($750m) of the original C$5.8 billion cost; but Ms Campbell's announcement has merely made the deal a live issue again. A nastier affair is still round her neck: a belated flow of revelations of murderous indiscipline in the Canadian Airborne Regiment in Somalia.
The real cloud is economic. With little sin of recovery, and the unemployment rate now at 11.6%, the main issue will be jobs and the recent cost-cutting by the federal government and all ten provincial ones. In the past fiscal year, their combined deficits totalled C$60 billion, nearly 9% of GDP. Ms Campbell, though talking of eliminating today's C$32.6 billion federal deficit within five years, has promised there will be no new or higher taxes. So thousands of civil servants fear for their jobs, other voters for social programmes, such as medicare and pensions.
Jobs will be the issue for the New Democrat leader, Audrey McLauhlin. She has a detailed plan to create 1-1/2m of them over five years, while reducing the deficit and holding taxes steady. This appealing snake-oil, based on investing in everything from modern transportation to a national child-care system, is her party's best hope of climbing from its present sorry 8% in opinion polls. Of its present 43 seats, mostly in western Canada, half are at risk.
The Liberals will publish their full platform only after a week of campaigning. If they are even to come close to a clear majority, they must take two-thirds of the 99 seats in Ontario and--more difficult--regain some 20 in Quebec that they lost to Mr Mulroney, a Quebecker. But the popular Lucien Bouchard and his Bloc Quebecois could win half of the 75 seats there, on the issue of the economy as much as Quebecois sovereignty.","They have enjoyed one of the sunniest summers they can remember .

For as long as most can remember, the federal government has been run by one of two parties, usually the Liberals but for the past nine years the Progressive Conservatives, with the New Democrats as a strong third party providing a social conscience. After the general election on October 25th, two regional parties, the Bloc Quebecois and the Reform Party, are expected to have knocked the traditional pattern aside.
Under Brian Mulroney, the Tories won two handsome victories, based on strong support both in Mr Mulroney's native Quebec and in oil-rich Alberta in western Canada. But these two Tory pillars grew wobbly when Kim Campbell took over the leadership in June; during the 47-day election campaign they have visibly crumbled. Ms Campbell, a lawyer from British Columbia who had difficulties in the French-language television debate, has seen Mr Mulroney's followers slide over to the Bloc Quebecois, which is expected to win most of Quebec's 75 seats. Meanwhile, Preston Manning, the son of a former premier of Alberta, has spread enthusiasm for the simple verities of his Reform Party--a balanced budget, smaller government, less immigration through western Canada and into Ontario.
The main pre-election question is whether the Liberals under Jean Chretien will win a narrow majority of the 295 seats, or have to struggle as a coalition or minority government. The Liberals have won support with their plausible plan for job-creation, a more attractive line--in a country with chronic unemployment now running above ll%--than Ms Campbell's insistence on reducing the budget deficit. But debts and deficits remain, and the new Reform MPS, plus whatever is left of the Tories, will undoubtedly chase the issue of economic management.
The Bloc Quebecois may well help Mr Chretien out on economic questions; its leader, Lucien Bouchard, places the party left of centre. But as a party fighting for Quebec sovereignty (a supposedly unfrightening form of separatism), it will otherwise be at logerheads with the Liberals. Somewhat in the tradition of Charles Stewart Parnell and Irish home rule in the British Parliament of the 1880s, its overriding object in coming to Ottawa is to fight for Quebec's interests and to prepare the way for Quebec's departure from the Canadian confederation within three years. Mr Bouchard's timetable is based on Quebec's provincial election next year, which his separatist ally (not contesting the federal election), the Parti Quebecois, may well win.
Mr Chretien's campaign has fared reasonably well in English Canada partly because people remember his long and respectable record in federal politics as Pierre Trudeau's lieutenant; by contrast Ms Campbell's way across the country has been littered with imprudent remarks. But Mr Chretien's links to Trudeau federalism, which offered no special treatment for Quebec, make him anathema to the nationalists around Mr Bouchard.
When battle is joined in the next constitutional round, it will be bruising. Mr Manning and his colleagues have shown no sympathy for Quebec's aspirations, and indeed their party has grown in reaction to Quebec's influence on Ottawa.

Half of those who voted on October 25th in its querulous, mostly French-speaking province of Quebec supported a party that says No. How many truly share that view is not clear. To send the Bloc Quebecois to the federal parliament in Ottawa as the main opposition is one thing. To elect its provincial equivalent, the Parti Quebecois, to power in Quebec next year would be another; and to support the demand for Quebec's independence in a referendum to be held there in 1995 a still more fateful step. Yet all of this could happen in the aftershocks of an election that has reduced the governing party to rubble and remade Canada's political landscape (see page 43). The question is what, if anything, other Canadians should, or can, do to repair their fissile federation.
The sensible answer--though not, for many Canadians, the sentimental one--is not very much. Separation would do Canada no great harm. In an era of free trade and free movement, no vital part of its economy would be torn apart. Its geographically disconnected Atlantic provinces would no doubt feel isolated, but little more so, in practical terms, than they are now. That needs to be set against Quebec's grievances, which are founded in history and tribal consciousness--forces that can often be even stronger than those of economics.
Quebec's provincial government already controls its own education and nearly all its own linguistic policy, the foundations of national identity. It does not control its own economy, but then no non-communist government does. It is suffering painfully from unemployment, but so is all of Canada. It is as much (which is a lot) in control of its own taxation as any other province. It likes to see itself as the poor stepdaughter, ill-treated by a miserly mother in Ottawa. Yet federal money, not least for high technology, has flowed freely to the province. For the past five years, to go no further back, most Quebec MPS have been on the government side; the Conservative prime minister until a few months ago, Brian Mulroney, was himself from Quebec, as is Jean Chretien, the new Liberal one. Insofar as Quebec has a case against the centre, it is one shared by most other provinces. What more does it want?
The problematic answer has long been: quite a lot. Canada has made two recent attempts to meet Quebec's demands. The first was rejected by the other provinces. But a second deal, which included recognition of Quebec as a ""distinct society"" and lots of protection for its Frenchness, was accepted by all the provincial governments, Quebec's included, as well as the federal one--only to be thrown out in a referendum last year. The Quebecois, unlike their government, thought it gave them too little; many other Canadians thought it gave them too much.
When people feel like that, with both sides unready for the compromises that could keep them together, they should perhaps part. That would not be painless: history and tribal feeling are not the monopoly of Canada's French-speakers, and there are many Canadians who feel for Canada just as Quebecois do for Quebec. Nor would Anglo-Canadians, thoroughly fed up with Quebec, bend over backwards, financially or otherwise, to help it on its way. But in the end it takes only one to end a marriage. If one province does feel that way, while the others think the demands it makes for a still fragile reconciliation are unreasonably high, so be it.
BREAKING UP STILL HURTS
Yet even if the possibility of a sovereign Quebec need not alarm outsiders unduly, the breaking up of Canada would have other costs. First to feel them would be Quebec's English-speakers. Even now, linguistic zeal weighs on the 18% or so of Quebeckers who do not speak French. Never mind the language of shop-signs. The rules that prevent non-Canadian newcomers from sending their children to English-language schools pose a much harder problem. There are arguments for this based on social integration. But that is not the purpose; and there is a strong case of civil liberty against it. True, the Quebec government already warns might-be immigrants of its rules. But how quickly, in an independent Quebec, would an acceptable concern for national identity become linguistic chauvinism?
The portents are not encouraging. About a fifth of Canada's people do not, of choice, speak its main language. About a fifth of Quebec's cannot speak its. Canada has two official languages Quebec has only one. When Lucien Bouchard, the Bloc Quebecois leader, celebrated his triumph on Monday night before the television cameras, he spoke in French to his Quebecois supporters. He spoke briefly--and responsibly--in English to the rest of Canada. For English-speaking Quebeckers, fellow citizens of his may-be country, he had not a word.
For the outside world--a gleeful France excepted--a Canada-in-pieces, though no disaster, would be no asset either. An independent Quebec would be unlikely to want to denounce international accords accepted by today's Canada, whether of defence or trade. Quebec's nationalists are not, as one might imagine, wild protectionists: on the contrary, it is the Liberals, now in national power, who have talked--implausibly--of renegotiating the existing free-trade agreement with the United States and the still-to-happen NAFTA deal. Yet could NAFTA, already at risk in the United States, survive the shattering of Canada into squabbling pieces? The parting, however messy, would not threaten a new Bosnia. Still, a smaller Canada, its insistent voice for fair-mindedness and good citizenship muted in the world's councils, would be a loss.
Put it simply. If Canada breaks apart--and if is not yet when--the United Nations would gain a new member, the United States would have two northern neighbours instead of one, and that would be about it. Canada as we now know it would have one. That would be sad, but bearable.","Is Canada worth preserving?

The portents are not encouraging. About a fifth of Canada's people do not, of choice, speak its main language. About a fifth of Quebec's cannot speak its. Canada has two official languages Quebec has only one. When Lucien Bouchard, the Bloc Quebecois leader, celebrated his triumph on Monday night before the television cameras, he spoke in French to his Quebecois supporters. He spoke briefly--and responsibly--in English to the rest of Canada. For English-speaking Quebeckers, fellow citizens of his may-be country, he had not a word.
For the outside world--a gleeful France excepted--a Canada-in-pieces, though no disaster, would be no asset either. An independent Quebec would be unlikely to want to denounce international accords accepted by today's Canada, whether of defence or trade. Quebec's nationalists are not, as one might imagine, wild protectionists: on the contrary, it is the Liberals, now in national power, who have talked--implausibly--of renegotiating the existing free-trade agreement with the United States and the still-to-happen NAFTA deal. Yet could NAFTA, already at risk in the United States, survive the shattering of Canada into squabbling pieces? The parting, however messy, would not threaten a new Bosnia. Still, a smaller Canada, its insistent voice for fair-mindedness and good citizenship muted in the world's councils, would be a loss.
Put it simply. If Canada breaks apart--and if is not yet when--the United Nations would gain a new member, the United States would have two northern neighbours instead of one, and that would be about it. Canada as we now know it would have one. That would be sad, but bearable.",20,Canada,A29-142,,False,,0,True

As the long election campaign progressed, Jean Chretien grew more confident of winning a modest majority of the 295 seats in Canada's Parliament for his Liberal Party. On October 25th he succeeded, but perhaps a little too well. The Liberals won 177 seats and in the process devastated the other two traditional, federalist parties. The Progressive Conservatives, who held 157 seats at the start of this campaign, have been reduced to an absurd two. The New Democrats have sunk from 44 to nine.
In the debris of these old parties stand two fresh, dangerous opponents. The new groupings show up Canada's fault lines. The Liberals won all but one of the 32 seats in the four provinces of Atlantic Canada, and all but one of the 99 seats in Ontario. But they won less than one-third of the 75 seats in Quebec, where the separatist Bloc Quebecois took 54 and now becomes the official opposition. They also won only one third of the 89 seats lying west of Ontario, where the right-wing Reform Party took 51 (plus a solitary Ontario seat).
On election night Lucien Bouchard, for the Bloc, spoke of the aims (economic growth and job creation) that he shared with the Liberals; Preston Manning for the Reformers talked of the need to develop ""a new federalism"". Behind these polite sentiments lies the unpleasant fact that the two parties are protest movements with overwhelming strength in their regions--and antipathetic to one another.
There are straws to clutch in this high wind. The most substantial is the size of the Liberal majority. Mr Chretien will be able to stimulate the economy without worrying overmuch about criticism from the cost-cutting Reformers. He has a pretty good crew. Among the small contingents of Liberal MPS from western Canada and from Quebec are excellent newcomers, and his cabinet may be the most talented for a generation.
His party boasts a record number of 53 women MPS, including Ethel Blondin-Andrew, an Inuit from the Western Arctic, and Jean Augustine, who emigrated from Jamaica under the domestic workers programme to become head of Toronto's housing authority. And he himself is a reassuring presence. His reputation is a comfort after the mistrust that Brian Mulroney, the former Conservative leader, provoked; his experience (the prime ministership is his tenth portfolio) shows up well in contrast to the amateurish performance of Kim Campbell, who ends her brief spell as Conservative prime minister.
But on the most vital issue of all--whether or not Quebec will stay within Canada--he is hobbled by his past. As Pierre Trudeau's loyal lieutenant, he is linked to the policy of treating Quebec constitutionally like any other province. This makes it difficult for him to switch to a more flexible approach. Recognising this handicap, he appealed in his victory speech to Canadians to ""leave constitutional quarrels on the back burner"". Mr Bouchard, who stormed out of the Mulroney cabinet to form the Bloc Quebecois when the Meech Lake constitutional amendments failed in 1990, is hardly likely to agree.
Mr Bouchard's first words to his nationalist supporters on election night were to remind them of the defiance of Rene Levesque, Quebec's late premier, when he lost the referendum on sovereignty in 1980: ""We will see you next time"". For Mr Bouchard, that time will come if the Parti Quebecois (the Bloc's provincial ally) wins the provincial election next year--and honours Levesque's memory by winning, through another referendum, the mandate to carry Quebec and its 7m people to political sovereignty.
Optimists say that Monday's election has got rid of under cover manoeuvres and ambiguity: the Quebec issue will now have to be settled in a straightforward manner. Some even suggest that the Bloc's MPS will be converted to federalism through the chemistry of companionship in Ottawa and the give-and-take of question time.
But the old way of placating Quebec nationalism was to slip lucrative contracts to the province and allow its government more administrative power than any other. This would be hard for Mr Chretien. He has committed himself to cancelling the Tories' controversial C$5.8 billion ($4.4 billion) contract for military helicopters, much of which would have flowed to Quebec. And if he offers Quebec other plums, he will risk loud shouts from the Reform Party.
LOST IN THE DEBRIS
Meanwhile, the Conservatives and the New Democrats have to burrow their way out of the rubble. The surviving Tory MPS are an ill-matched pair: Jean Charest, who ran a close second to Ms Campbell for the leadership in June, and Elsie Wayne, a former New Brunswick mayor. Kim Campbell herself, having carried the weight of Mr Mulroney's unpopularity across Canada in an exhausting campaign, made a graceful exit on losing her Vancouver seat.
She may continue as party leader for a year or more, while rebuilding begins. More than 2m Canadians voted Conservative--more than for the Bloc Quebecois--and her party could have held some 20 seats in Ontario if the intervention of Reform candidates had not handed them to Liberals. The Conservatives still have a power base in the Senate, which Mr Mulroney brazenly packed before his departure.
The New Democrats, too, were humbled. Their leader, Audrey McLaughlin, survived in the Yukon, as did six others in the Prairies, the party's most secure base. But they were eliminated in Ontario, where Bob Rae's provincial government is unpopular, and almost wiped out in British Columbia for a similar reason--Michael Harcourt's NDP government lost support both for its tough measures on the deficit and for a compromise on the logging of Clayoquot rainforest that enraged environmentalists.
The New Democrats picked an uninspiring campaign issue--anxiety about the trade agreements with the United States and Mexico--and yielded ground to Mr Chretien, who concentrated steadily on the hope of good times ahead. But the NDP probably retains its niche to the left of the Liberals as a party of social conscience (so long as that is still relevant). By contrast, the Conservatives, or what remains of them, are squeezed between the Liberals moving to the right and the Reform Party surging from the far-right. Kim Campbell's final affectionate words to her followers on election night--""Consider yourselves hugged""--may carry a more ominous meaning.","Brian Mulroney's wildest dream , or a nightmare ?

The ruling provincial Liberal Party has changed leaders, members of the opposition Parti Quebecois (PQ) are already scenting victory and choosing the ministries they wish to head, and a third force, the Parti Action Quebec, has set its founding convention for February.
This is not just another instance of Quebec's obsession with politics. If the PQ, under Jacques Parizeau, wins the election--which today looks likely--it is committed to a referendum on sovereignty within a year. Were it to win that too--which is less likely--it would then seek to negotiate the separation of Quebec and its mostly French-speaking 7m people from the rest of Canada. The stakes are high.
Daniel Johnson, the Liberals' new leader since December 15th--there were no other candidates--replaces Robert Bourassa, who is retiring after two bouts of skin cancer. Mr Bourassa, a big man in Quebec politics, began his first term as premier in 1970. Mr Johnson becomes premier next month, the third member of his family to hold that post. Whereas the earlier two--his father and younger brother--were lukewarm separatists, the new Liberal leader is a firm federalist, aligned with the business establishment. For the past five years he has been in charge of Quebec's finances, busy cutting government spending and confronting nurses, building workers and other strikers.
His future looks far from happy. He takes over an exhausted party. Quebec's Liberals have always kept their distance from the federal party, which regained power in Ottawa in October; Mr Bourassa, indeed, quietly allied himself with the Conservative prime minister, Brian Mulroney, in the 1988 federal election, fought on the issue of free trade with the United States. At present the Liberals hold 86 seats in Quebec's national (sic) assembly, to the PQ's 33. But they are running more than ten points behind the PQ in opinion polls, and on December 13th lost a fourth successive provincial by-election. Ominously, half of Mr Bourassa's ministers have already announced their retirement from politics. Mr Johnson, whom even his friends more often call competent than inspiring, has little time to turn this electoral tide.
The new Parti Action Quebec will pull votes from both Liberals and PQ. Its leader, Jean Allaire, was a prominent provincial Liberal, but left the party in 1992 over its federalist stand on constitutional change. He is a sovereigntist, as Canadians call Quebec's separatists, but a pale one beside Mr Parizeau. He would hope to keep close economic links with the rest of Canada.
In that, he is closer to Lucien Bouchard, leader of the (federal) Bloc Quebecois, which won 54 seats in October's election. All polls show Mr Bouchard as the most popular politician in Quebec, and the man whom sovereigntists would like as their first president rather than the pompous Mr Parizeau. But he will be busy in Ottawa, albeit keener on pursuing Quebec ambitions than his role as official leader of the opposition. It is not clear, as the two line up for next year's Quebec election, how closely in harness the BQ is with the PQ.

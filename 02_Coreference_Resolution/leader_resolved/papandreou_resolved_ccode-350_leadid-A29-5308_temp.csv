They are not quite like anybody else, anywhere, and they are especially different from the Slavs and Turks and Arabs who occupy so much of the neighbouring part of the world.

Sometimes Greece's place on the map can even help, in the periods of history when Europe is on easy terms with its neighbours to the east. Then geography, and the entrepreneurial cleverness that Greeks seem to carry in their bones, make their country a natural trading post between Europe and the countries of south-west Asia and northern Africa.
Unfortunately, such periods are rare. For much of the time, perched on the end of its European promontory, Greece feels lonely and insecure. It does not know quite where it belongs, or what it stands for. It is currently going through a bad patch of such uncertainty.
Since they won their independence from the Ottoman empire 170 years ago, there have been only three times when Greeks could justifiably feel the world was smiling on them. There was the brief glory of the 1820s, when Greece was the first part of south-eastern Europe to break free from the Turks, and high-minded liberals all over Europe thought they were seeing the rebirth of Periclean Athens. The illusion soon faded, and an administration of dull Bavarians had to be imported to sort out the Greeks' affairs for them.
In three hopeful decades between 1882 and 1912 the Greeks began to pull their politics together; they also captured a huge new slice of Ottoman-held territory. Then came another political bust-up and the catastrophe of 1921-22, when a Greek army tried to march on Ankara and was roundly beaten by the new Turkey oF Kemal Ataturk.
The longest and best of the times when things went well was the one that started in 1945, when Greece was suddenly the only non-communist country in Europe east of Vienna.

They chose their governments, except during the seven buffoonish years of the colonels' dictatorship, in a properly democratic way. They were a useful member of the West's military alliance, and in 1981 they persuaded a hesitant European Community to take them in as full members.
But now this third bright period may also be coming to an end. The Socialist government of the 1980s spent too much money and collected too little, thereby going spectacularly into the red. The growth rate fell, inflation soared. Worse, the end of communism removed Greece's claim to be of special interest to the democracies of the West. It remains a member of NATO, but it has no longer any obvious function. It is part of the European Community, but the other Europeans are worried about its economy and deeply irritated by the way it has treated new-born Macedonia next door.
THE CATASTROPHE THAT COULD BE
The Greeks, in short, are back where history has put them before, on the fringe oF the western world's concern. They are also on the edge of something that could be even more immediately dangerous. Unless they show an unprecedented degree of self-discipline, the economic disappointment of the past dozen years could slide past the point of no return. For Greece's hopes of joining the modern world, this would be as big a catastrophe as the humiliation the Greek army suffered in Anatolia 70 years ago.
The heart of the economic matter is whether the government will insist on collecting more money than it spends, so that it can reduce the mountain of public debt that has piled up since 1980 (see chart 1). (Chart 1 omitted)
The conservatives of the New Democracy Party promised to tackle the problem when they came back to office in 1990, but little progress was made until a tough new economics minister, Stephanos Manos, was appointed last year.
The measures Mr Manos introduced have at last started to get the figures moving firmly in the right direction. But the battle is far from won. The debt is still rising, though more slowly than before, and it will probably not start to fall until the basic budget--the part that excludes payments on the debt--is running an annual surplus equivalent to 7% of Greece's gross domestic product.
That is a dauntingly large amount. Even on the government's estimates, which may be too hopeful, it will not be achieved until 1995--and meantime an election has to be held, by May next year.
Hitherto the universal election-time practice of Greek governments, of left or right, has been to spend more money and go easy on taxes. This time New Democracy has to resist the temptation. There can be no major relaxation of its new-found economic rigour. If the Socialists win the election, they too will have to bite the bullet. The alternative is to push the task of debt reduction even further into the future. The risk then is that the government will find itself unable to refinance the short-term part of the debt, and will have to print the money instead--and there comes hyper-inflation.
If Greece is to shape a coherent future for itself, it has to do three hard things. It faces several more years of economic self-restraint, with no real easing in prospect until the second half oF the 1880s. It needs a shake-out of its two main political parties, because both New Democracy and the Socialists contain people who are not truly interested in the building of a modern society and an efficient economy. And it has to make up its mind where it stands in the matter of the European Community. Does it really wish to dissolve itself into a European federation, as many of its intellectuals claim, or does it still have specifically Greek aims to pursue in the Balkans and the Middle East?
OUT OF THE SPELL?
Impossible, many will say; the Greeks can never bring all that off. The sceptics have plenty of history on their side. Greeks have never been good at the plodding job, even in their classical prime; Demosthenes was not the only one to complain of that. The governments of modern Greece, the country that emerged in the 1820s from nearly four centuries of Ottoman rule, have been notoriously quarrelsome and changeable. That is why soldiers called Metaxas and Papadopoulos have from time to time felt obliged to step forward and try a spot of military dictatorship. Greece is not, on the evidence of the past, the sort of place to carry through the democratic reconstruction it now needs.
This time, though, the sceptics may be wrong. It is at last possible that things are changing. The prime minister, Constantine Mitsotakis, almost certainly understands what has to be done. The three chief contenders for the leadership of the Socialist Party, when the ailing Andreas Papandreou hands it over, all tell you sensible thins that would have got them drummed out of the party ten years ago. The opinion polls have begun to suggest that ordinary Greeks are getting tired of the alternation of placeholders that has made up so much of recent Greek politics.

1993-05-22,https://www-proquest-com.proxy.uchicago.edu/abicomplete/docview/224150362/fulltext/F440024BE7334DBCPQ/82?accountid=14657,"To understand the two most important things about the Greek economy, you need to remember that economic performance is just one of the outward manifestations of a people's inner life. The Greeks of 1993 are trying to get to grips with a pair of huge economic imbalances. One is to a large extent the consequence of something deep in the Greek character. The other is at least partly the result of what history did to the Greeks between 1453 and 1821, the centuries of Ottoman rule when ""government"" meant something alien. The first imbalance is grave; the second is potentially fatal.
The merely grave one is Greece's imbalance of trade. In round terms the Greeks buy three times as many goods from the outside world as they manage to sell to it. Last year their imports cost nearly $20 billion; their exports brought in just over $6 billion. That leaves a yawning gap--17% of Greece's GDP--to be filled by other means (see chart 2). (Chart 2 omitted)
The gap is so big because the Greeks have never managed to build up much of an industry. Their farms produce some excellent things--first-class olive oil, plenty of good fruit and vegetables, a short but growing list of wines a Frenchman might be persuaded to drink--but Greece has not yet found a way of selling them abroad on a large scale. Agriculture provides little more than a quarter of total exports; no doubt that figure can be improved, but not enormously. There is a handful of raw-material exports. But the Greeks, though they enjoy buying the products of other people's factories, are stubbornly reluctant to go in for factories themselves.
It is not for want of encouragement. Greek governments have provided the usual tax incentives for the right sort of investment, and the usual cunning export subsidies. In the blithe mid-century days when five-year plans were supposed to create industrial sectors at the flick of a wand, there were five-year plans galore.
To little avail. Greeks with money do not want to put it into building factories. Other Greeks do not want o work in them; they prefer the little shop, the handyman's job, doing something for cousin Yannis. Nobody who has ever murmured, ""Ah! What individualists the Greeks are!"" should be surprised by this. But the statistics reveal the economic consequence: a manufacturing sector in 1990 with a smaller share of GDP than it had in 1960 (see chart 3 on next page). (Chart omitted) It is the service sector, producing little foreign currency, that has swollen.
This is an experience familiar to the old industrial countries. But it was only in the 1950s that Greece set out to build a serious manufacturing sector--and immediately, unlike the Koreas and Spains of the world, found it was not capable of it.
So how is the trade gap to be filled? One old stand-by is remittances, the money sent home by Greeks living abroad. The Greek diaspora is almost as big and lively as the Jewish one. Something like 4m people who speak Greek, or think of themselves as Greek, are scattered around the world. They have been loyal with their money, as well as their feelings, to the 10m who still live in Greece; their remittances still cover about a sixth of the trade gap (see table 4 on next page). (Table 4 omitted)
But the money will not flow in on this scale forever. The great wave of imigrants who left Greece in the 1950s and 1960s subsided long ago. Third-generation and fourth-generation Greeks abroad will not be quite so ready to open their wallets. Remittances are a fading asset.
The other stand-by has been the money earned by Greece's merchant navy. Ships flying the Greek flag make up the world's third-biggest merchant fleet, after Liberia's and Panama's (having recently beaten an uppity Japan back into fourth place), and account for 40 of the European Community's total tonnage. Ships owned by Greeks but flying other countries' flags double the Greek-flag tonnage. In all, shipping in 1992 made almost as big a contribution as remittances to closing that trade deficit.
But this too has its limits. The Greek merchant fleet is much smaller than it was a dozen years ago. Its earnings, as a share of GDP, have halved, and its contribution to the balance of payments has fallen even more sharply. Moreover, most of the Greek fleet is in the bulk trade, at a time when merchant shipping is becoming increasingly specialised: you now need chemical-carriers, food-carriers, and so on. Greek shipowners are nimble men, but it will take some brave (and expensive) investment decisions if their fleet is to stay sufficiently up-to-date to maintain even its present share of the Greek economy.
Tourism, then? This already provides a bigger. contribution to the balance of payments than either remittances or shipping, and the Ministry of National Economy bubbles with ideas for making it still larger. Greece is to become ""the Florida of Europe"". There are to be a total of 30 new marinas, eight more casinos, nine new golf courses. Tourist offices will be open seven days a week; signposting is to be improved for visitors who do not know an alpha from an omega; there will be tougher inspection of hotels and boarding houses.
Fine, but some questions remain to be answered. What sort of new tourists are the Greeks hoping to attract? Not the Costa Brava hordes, they reply firmly; we want discerning, money-to-spare, middle-class visitors. But such people will want a smoother-running, cleaner, tidier Greece than the one tourists find now.
By 1997 or thereabouts Athens will have a new airport, plus the best underground railway in Europe (thanks to European Community money) and a big park-and-culture zone in the heart of the city (ditto). Soon afterwards Salonika too will have its underground (ditto again). Roads and railways are to be improved and so, in some of the places tourists flock to, is the sewerage system; see page 20.
All this will help, but it will take time. And meanwhile Greece has to reckon with the fact that Turkey, on the other side of the Aegean, is planning to lure exactly the same sort of middle-class tourist with exactly the same combination of sunshine, classical ruins and mildly exotic food--and, it must be added, with lower costs and beaches many of which are less in need of de-whiffing.
There remains the other great source of money from abroad--one in return for which with a single uncomfortable proviso, Greece needs to do nothing. The European Community gives Greece roughly $4 billion a year, almost 6% of its GDP and as much as net tourism and shipping together bring in. On top of this, the Second Delors Package (which adds ""cohesion"" money to ""structural aid"", farm support and the rest of it) could add up to half as much again. The first Greek economic miracle, of the 1950s and 1960s, was built on American Marshall aid. A second one, the Greeks hope, is about to be built on European money.
The only snag is that uncomfortable proviso. The EC is far from sure that the Greeks can be relied on to get their financial house in order. If it comes to the conclusion that they cannot, it will stop playing Midas. Which brings up the second of those two Greek imbalances--the potentially fatal one.
BUT FIRST BALANCE YOUR BUDGET
This is the Greek government's now almost chronic inability to balance its budget, and so stop itself sliding even more deeply into debt. Last year the soaring public debt reached almost 120% of GDP, even without counting the money owed for the weapons Greece's soldiers buy from abroad. Every country has budget problems, of course. But Greece's have become a lot worse than most other people's because of a couple of things those centuries it spent under Ottoman rule did to it.
One effect of the Ottoman years was to leave Greeks preternaturally suspicious of government, any government. The contemptuous name for ""the state"" is still a Turkish word, dovleti. The unimpressive performance of most post Ottoman Greek governments--itself partly a result of the general mistrust of the state--has made things no better. So it is almost a matter of philotimo, honour, that when in the relatively affluent Greece of recent years nobody who can possibly fiddle his taxes has failed to do so. Last year direct taxes extracted a mere 8% of GDP. Even the Italians manage nearly twice that.
The other effect of the Ottoman period--the reverse side of the coin--was to prolong the feudal element in the Greek character. For most Greeks, a political party has long been not so much the voice of an ideology, or even of a class, as a system of social protection. It answers the question, ""Who looks after whom?"" When your side wins an election, you expect it to help its followers by giving them plenty of undemanding if not very well-paid jobs (kicking out the other lot's placement in the process), arranging nice little contracts, inventing new pension wheezes, and so on. It is the sort of thing feudal lords were once expected to do.
All Greek parties have done it. But it got out of hand in 1981, when Andreas Papandreou's Socialists came to power. Their lot, they felt, had not had a proper turn since the defeat of the left in the civil war of the late 1940s. Now was the time to straighten the accounts. To the social reforms any left-of-centre government would have wanted to make, the Socialists added a large helping of the special Greek look-after-your-own system. The budget deficit quadrupled in the 1980s, and the public debt followed it into the stratosphere.
At long last something is being done to stop this. The conservatives, having regained a parliamentary majority in 1990, dithered until they were halfway through their four-year term of office. But last summer they took a deep breath, and a brave risk.
* A freeze was imposed on wage payments in a large part of the public sector. Because inflation at the time was about 16%, this inevitably meant a sharp cut in the workforce. It was also (rather optimistically) decided that in future only one new government employee can be recruited for every three who leave the service.
* Pensions were brought under control. Greece has had one of the most lavish old-age pension schemes in the western world, measured against national income; it spends relatively half as much again on its elderly as the OECD average. Now Greeks will have to pay more for their pensions, and wait longer for them.
* Privatisation has been speeded up. Of the dozens of ailing firms that the Socialists took under their wing in the 1980s, rather than let them die, almost ail have been sold back into private hands or wound up. So have 30-40 other smallish enterprises. Now the government wants to sell two big oil refineries, the National Tourist Organisation, and up to 49 of the shares in the vast state telecoms company.
If it all comes off, this will put 550 billion drachmas ($2.6 billion) into the state budget this year and next. But it is already clear that the programme is running into trouble. The officials in charge of it still cannot find out exactly how much some of the firms they would like to sell are worth--or indeed, says one, how many firms the state actually owns. And they are audibly unsure how keen on privatisation the government really is. The way things look now, Greece's public sector is not going to be cut as much as it ought to be.
* Most important, because his is the biggest part of the budget-rescue operation, Greeks are being told they have got to pay more tax. The government has said to the European Community that, of the 7.7-percentage-points improvement it hopes to make in the total public-sector deficit between 1992 and 1996---from 9.6% of GDP to 1.9%--more than half, 4.1 percentage points, is to come from extra taxes.
Some of this will be the result of the stiff increase in indirect taxes ordered last summer, notably in the tax on petrol. But the larger part is supposed to come from direct taxes. This is not because tax rates are being raised: on the contrary, they are being lowered. The squeeze comes in another way. The government's plan is that tax-dodging is suddenly to be made dramatically more difficult, by reorganising the tax-collecting system and making it easier for the taxman to spot the dodgers.
THAT BOTTOM-OF-THE-LEAGUE FEELING
Will it work? The spending-cuts part of the plan should do reasonably well. The pension reform is skilfully organised, and will save a lot of money (though most of this will help the social-security fund, not the government budget). The long-overdue squeeze on the public-sector workforce will save some more, though there are reports that unpublicised redundancy payments are eating up much of what is saved in wages. The privatisations also help, even if they do not go far enough. The big question-mark hangs over the tax-increase part of the programme. That question-mark needs the next article all to itself.
If it fails to get its finances in order, Greece has a black future. This place, which 30 years ago had the fastest-growing economy in democratic Europe, is now an economic failure. It gets more money from the European Community than anybody else, but despite this its economic performance has deteriorated alarmingly. It now has, on the published statistics, the lowest income per head in the Community, the lowest productivity, the highest inflation and the biggest external debt. And the gap between it and its fellow Europeans is widening.
The Greeks claim that their black economy is bigger than any other Community country's, and so in absolute terms they are not quite as badly off as the published statistics make it seem. But even if this is true (as it may be), it does not alter the fact that relatively speaking Greece is falling behind the rest of the Community; and the progress continues.
The downward slide is in danger of becoming a drop over the precipice. If the Greeks do not get their debt under control--and that, be it repeated, means getting a 7%-of-GDP surplus on the ordinary part of their budget, so as to have enough money left over to pay what is due on the debt--they will one day find they cannot sell the bonds that keep the debt going. They will then lose control of the money supply, and of inflation. They may also lose the generous donations from the European Community that enable them to pay what they owe abroad.
They must do what Sisyphus was commanded to do but, unlike Sisyphus, they must succeed. They have to heave and sweat their great stone to the top of the mountain, and plant it firmly on the summit. Otherwise it will roll back and crush them. Or, to recall another grim Greek myth, they must avoid the fate of Tantalus. The tantalising apple just above their heads is acceptance as a full member of the western world. The Greeks have kept on reaching up for it, and it has kept on slipping through their fingers. Let this be the leap that grasps.","To understand the two most important things about the Greek economy , you need to remember that economic performance is just one of the outward manifestations of a people 's inner life .

 To little avail . Greeks with money do not want to put it into building factories . Other Greeks do not want o work in them ; they prefer the little shop , the handyman 's job , doing something for cousin Yannis . Nobody who has ever murmured , "" Ah ! What individualists the Greeks are ! "" should be surprised by this . But the statistics reveal the economic consequence : a manufacturing sector in 1990 with a smaller share of GDP than it had in 1960 ( see chart 3 on next page ) . ( Chart omitted ) It is the service sector , producing little foreign currency , that has swollen . 
 This is an experience familiar to the old industrial countries . But it was only in the 1950s that Greece set out to build a serious manufacturing sector -- and immediately , unlike the Koreas and Spains of the world , found it was not capable of it . 
 So how is the trade gap to be filled ? One old stand - by is remittances , the money sent home by Greeks living abroad . The Greek diaspora is almost as big and lively as the Jewish one . Something like 4 m people who speak Greek , or think of themselves as Greek , are scattered around the world . They have been loyal with their money , as well as their feelings , to the 10 m who still live in Greece ; their remittances still cover about a sixth of the trade gap ( see table 4 on next page ) . ( Table 4 omitted ) 
 But the money will not flow in on this scale forever . The great wave of imigrants who left Greece in the 1950s and 1960s subsided long ago . Third - generation and fourth - generation Greeks abroad will not be quite so ready to open their wallets . Remittances are a fading asset . 
 The other stand - by has been the money earned by Greece 's merchant navy . Ships flying the Greek flag make up the world 's third - biggest merchant fleet , after Liberia 's and Panama 's ( having recently beaten an uppity Japan back into fourth place ) , and account for 40 of the European Community 's total tonnage . Ships owned by Greeks but flying other countries ' flags double the Greek - flag tonnage . In all , shipping in 1992 made almost as big a contribution as remittances to closing that trade deficit . 
 But this too has its limits . The Greek merchant fleet is much smaller than it was a dozen years ago . Its earnings , as a share of GDP , have halved , and its contribution to the balance of payments has fallen even more sharply . Moreover , most of the Greek fleet is in the bulk trade , at a time when merchant shipping is becoming increasingly specialised : you now need chemical - carriers , food - carriers , and so on . Greek shipowners are nimble men , but it will take some brave ( and expensive ) investment decisions if their fleet is to stay sufficiently up - to - date to maintain even its present share of the Greek economy . 
 Tourism , then ? This already provides a bigger . contribution to the balance of payments than either remittances or shipping , and the Ministry of National Economy bubbles with ideas for making it still larger . Greece is to become "" the Florida of Europe "" . There are to be a total of 30 new marinas , eight more casinos , nine new golf courses . Tourist offices will be open seven days a week ; signposting is to be improved for visitors who do not know an alpha from an omega ; there will be tougher inspection of hotels and boarding houses . 
 Fine , but some questions remain to be answered . What sort of new tourists are the Greeks hoping to attract ? Not the Costa Brava hordes , they reply firmly ; we want discerning , money - to - spare , middle - class visitors . But such people will want a smoother - running , cleaner , tidier Greece than the one tourists find now . 
 By 1997 or thereabouts Athens will have a new airport , plus the best underground railway in Europe ( thanks to European Community money ) and a big park - and - culture zone in the heart of the city ( ditto ) . Soon afterwards Salonika too will have its underground ( ditto again ) . Roads and railways are to be improved and so , in some of the places tourists flock to , is the sewerage system ; see page 20 . 
 All this will help , but it will take time . And meanwhile Greece has to reckon with the fact that Turkey , on the other side of the Aegean , is planning to lure exactly the same sort of middle - class tourist with exactly the same combination of sunshine , classical ruins and mildly exotic food -- and , it must be added , with lower costs and beaches many of which are less in need of de - whiffing . 
 There remains the other great source of money from abroad -- one in return for which with a single uncomfortable proviso , Greece needs to do nothing . The European Community gives Greece roughly $ 4 billion a year , almost 6 % of its GDP and as much as net tourism and shipping together bring in . On top of this , the Second Delors Package ( which adds "" cohesion "" money to "" structural aid "" , farm support and the rest of it ) could add up to half as much again . The first Greek economic miracle , of the 1950s and 1960s , was built on American Marshall aid . A second one , the Greeks hope , is about to be built on European money . 
 The only snag is that uncomfortable proviso . The EC is far from sure that the Greeks can be relied on to get their financial house in order . If it comes to the conclusion that they can not , it will stop playing Midas . Which brings up the second of those two Greek imbalances -- the potentially fatal one . 
 BUT FIRST BALANCE YOUR BUDGET 
 This is the Greek government 's now almost chronic inability to balance its budget , and so stop itself sliding even more deeply into debt . Last year the soaring public debt reached almost 120 % of GDP , even without counting the money owed for the weapons Greece 's soldiers buy from abroad . Every country has budget problems , of course . But Greece 's have become a lot worse than most other people 's because of a couple of things those centuries it spent under Ottoman rule did to it . 
 One effect of the Ottoman years was to leave Greeks preternaturally suspicious of government , any government . The contemptuous name for "" the state "" is still a Turkish word , dovleti . The unimpressive performance of most post Ottoman Greek governments -- itself partly a result of the general mistrust of the state -- has made things no better . So it is almost a matter of philotimo , honour , that when in the relatively affluent Greece of recent years nobody who can possibly fiddle his taxes has failed to do so . Last year direct taxes extracted a mere 8 % of GDP . Even the Italians manage nearly twice that . 
 The other effect of the Ottoman period -- the reverse side of the coin -- was to prolong the feudal element in the Greek character . For most Greeks , a political party has long been not so much the voice of an ideology , or even of a class , as a system of social protection . It answers the question , "" Who looks after whom ? "" When your side wins an election , you expect it to help its followers by giving them plenty of undemanding if not very well - paid jobs ( kicking out the other lot 's placement in the process ) , arranging nice little contracts , inventing new pension wheezes , and so on . It is the sort of thing feudal lords were once expected to do . 
 All Greek parties have done it . But it got out of hand in 1981 , when Andreas Papandreou's came to power . Andreas Papandreou's lot , Andreas Papandreou felt , had not had a proper turn since the defeat of the left in the civil war of the late 1940s . Now was the time to straighten the accounts . To the social reforms any left - of - centre government would have wanted to make , Andreas Papandreou added a large helping of the special Greek look - after - your - own system . The budget deficit quadrupled in the 1980s , and the public debt followed it into the stratosphere . 
 At long last something is being done to stop this . The conservatives , having regained a parliamentary majority in 1990 , dithered until they were halfway through their four - year term of office . But last summer they took a deep breath , and a brave risk . 
 * A freeze was imposed on wage payments in a large part of the public sector . Because inflation at the time was about 16 % , this inevitably meant a sharp cut in the workforce . It was also ( rather optimistically ) decided that in future only one new government employee can be recruited for every three who leave the service . 
 * Pensions were brought under control . Greece has had one of the most lavish old - age pension schemes in the western world , measured against national income ; it spends relatively half as much again on its elderly as the OECD average . Now Greeks will have to pay more for their pensions , and wait longer for them . 
 * Privatisation has been speeded up . Of the dozens of ailing firms that Andreas Papandreou took under Andreas Papandreou's wing in the 1980s , rather than let them die , almost ail have been sold back into private hands or wound up . So have 30 - 40 other smallish enterprises . Now the government wants to sell two big oil refineries , the National Tourist Organisation , and up to 49 of the shares in the vast state telecoms company . 
 If it all comes off , this will put 550 billion drachmas ( $ 2.6 billion ) into the state budget this year and next . But it is already clear that the programme is running into trouble . The officials in charge of it still can not find out exactly how much some of the firms they would like to sell are worth -- or indeed , says one , how many firms the state actually owns . And they are audibly unsure how keen on privatisation the government really is . The way things look now , Greece 's public sector is not going to be cut as much as it ought to be . 
 * Most important , because his is the biggest part of the budget - rescue operation , Greeks are being told they have got to pay more tax . The government has said to the European Community that , of the 7.7 - percentage - points improvement it hopes to make in the total public - sector deficit between 1992 and 1996 - --from 9.6 % of GDP to 1.9%--more than half , 4.1 percentage points , is to come from extra taxes . 
 Some of this will be the result of the stiff increase in indirect taxes ordered last summer , notably in the tax on petrol . But the larger part is supposed to come from direct taxes . This is not because tax rates are being raised : on the contrary , they are being lowered . The squeeze comes in another way . The government 's plan is that tax - dodging is suddenly to be made dramatically more difficult , by reorganising the tax - collecting system and making it easier for the taxman to spot the dodgers . 
 THAT BOTTOM - OF - THE - LEAGUE FEELING 
 Will it work ? The spending - cuts part of the plan should do reasonably well . The pension reform is skilfully organised , and will save a lot of money ( though most of this will help the social - security fund , not the government budget ) . The long - overdue squeeze on the public - sector workforce will save some more , though there are reports that unpublicised redundancy payments are eating up much of what is saved in wages . The privatisations also help , even if they do not go far enough . The big question - mark hangs over the tax - increase part of the programme . That question - mark needs the next article all to itself . 
 If it fails to get its finances in order , Greece has a black future . This place , which 30 years ago had the fastest - growing economy in democratic Europe , is now an economic failure . It gets more money from the European Community than anybody else , but despite this its economic performance has deteriorated alarmingly . It now has , on the published statistics , the lowest income per head in the Community , the lowest productivity , the highest inflation and the biggest external debt . And the gap between it and its fellow Europeans is widening . 
 The Greeks claim that their black economy is bigger than any other Community country 's , and so in absolute terms they are not quite as badly off as the published statistics make it seem . But even if this is true ( as it may be ) , it does not alter the fact that relatively speaking Greece is falling behind the rest of the Community ; and the progress continues . 
 The downward slide is in danger of becoming a drop over the precipice . If the Greeks do not get their debt under control -- and that , be it repeated , means getting a 7%-of - GDP surplus on the ordinary part of their budget , so as to have enough money left over to pay what is due on the debt -- they will one day find they can not sell the bonds that keep the debt going . They will then lose control of the money supply , and of inflation . They may also lose the generous donations from the European Community that enable them to pay what they owe abroad . 
 They must do what Sisyphus was commanded to do but , unlike Sisyphus , they must succeed . They have to heave and sweat their great stone to the top of the mountain , and plant it firmly on the summit . Otherwise it will roll back and crush them . Or , to recall another grim Greek myth , they must avoid the fate of Tantalus . The tantalising apple just above their heads is acceptance as a full member of the western world . The Greeks have kept on reaching up for it , and it has kept on slipping through their fingers . Let this be the leap that grasps .",350,Greece,A29-5308,PRE TERM,True,Andreas Papandreou 's Socialists,6,True

Both parties were created less than 20 years ago, by men still living today; one of these has continued to be the leader of his lot, and the other founding-father is now president of the country. The right-hand party includes (on a French comparison) everybody from Valery Giscard d'Estaing to Jean-Marie Le Pen; the left-hand one (in British terms) everybody from Paddy Ashdown to a large chunk of the Militant Tendency. Both are run from the top: party headquarters pick the candidates at election time, control the patronage, take no nonsense from the constituencies. In short, both of them combine motley membership with rigid structure--which does not make for relaxed, efficient teamwork.
This is Greece. If the Greeks do get their economy under control, they still have to do something about their politics. Greek parties are no longer, as they once were, just vehicles of personal ambition (there really once was a ""George Papandreou Party""). Today's big two have kept the same names for 18 years, and the right-of-centre one has unprecedentedly changed leaders without breaking up. This is no longer the politics of the Levant. Nevertheless, the Greek system still has some way to travel before it will be the sort of political machine a post cold-war democracy requires.
WHAT POST-COMMUNIST POLITICS NEEDS
Now that communism has one, parties do not have to choose between two irreconcilable ideologies, two utterly different ways of running a country. Nor, as the country grows richer, do they represent hugely different social classes. They are all democrats now-real democrats, not ""single-party democrats""--and they all believe in market economics. Their relatively humdrum job these days is merely to argue about the best mechanism for finding out what the people want, the best way of looking after the country's interests abroad and, in economics, the rival merits of maximising productive efficiency and maximising compassion for the poor devils who get least out of the efficiency.
No country's parties have yet fully adjusted themselves to the new pattern--of the big countries, the United States and Germany are probably closest--but Greece is further away than most of the rest of the western world. This is because Greek politics is still distorted by two stubbornly persistent hangovers from Greece's past.
The distortion of the Socialists (who got 38.6% of the vote in the 1990 election, and 33.8% in an early May opinion poll, when 23.8% were ""undecided"") is the easier one for outsiders to understand.
The Greek civil war of 1946-49--less than half a century ago in fact, but merely yesterday in the politics of south-east Europe--was the last great European left-versus-right convulsion; by comparison, the Hungarian rebellion of 1956 was no more than a bloody skirmish. After the Greek civil war, the losers were excluded from public life for more than three decades. This embittered minority included not only Creeks who chose to vote for the Communists, when these were eventually relegalised, but a large number of those who voted for the Socialist Party that Andreas Papandreou created in 1974. Hence the slogan--Allaghi, the Change""--with which the Socialists came to power in 1981.
Even now, many older Socialists feel abandoned by history: Jacobites, as it were, condemned to live in a country run by triumphant whigs. The party needs a shake-out, if it is to be the driving-force on the compassionate side of the new politics.
It is unlikely to get a shake-out while Mr Papandreou is its leader. But even Mr Papandreou, who in recent years has survived a brutal scandal, major heart surgery and a demanding new marriage, is now looking pretty hail. Of those who might succeed him as leader, at least two men and one woman--Constantine Simitis, Gerasimos Arsenis and Vasso Papandreou (no relation)--could probably do for Greece's left what Michel Rocard has proposed to do for France's. The Socialists need to redefine themselves as a definitively ex-Marxist party that is nevertheless keener on social fairness (and better at keeping Greece green and clean) than its conservative rival.
But those conservatives of New Democracy (46.9% of the vote in 1990, but only 24.1% in this month's opinion poll) also need a shake-out. The New Democrats' distortion is nationalism: not the reasoned nationalism of the anti-federalists in today's European Community, or even the relatively disciplined nationalism of 19th-century Western Europe, but something much more primal.
This has shown itself most vividly in the miserable business of Macedonia. When the Macedonians broke away from ex-Yugoslavia last year, the man who was then Greece's foreign minister, Antonis Samaras, told his EC colleagues that the new state could not have the word ""Macedonia"" in its name. His prime minister, Mr Mitsotakis, did not stop him, either because he did not know what Mr Samaras was about to do or because he thought he could fudge the issue. He could not. Nearly a million people (a tenth of Greece's population) demonstrated in Salonika; an opinion poll said that 72 were against any compromise on the name, and 20% were ready to fight about it; and up to a quarter of New Democracy's members of parliament threatened rebellion.
The Macedonia eruption is now technically over. Greece was obliged this spring to accept the new country's admission to the United Nations with ""Macedonia"" in its name, and the New Democracy rebels swallowed their fury when they realised that voting against the government would cause an election their party would probably lose. But the damage is done.
The primitive ferocity of Greek nationalism, which is a sin of Greek insecurity, has bared its teeth again. A great many Greek politicians and officials who at the time said privately that they thought the thing was a nonsense heard themselves publicly using arguments which did not improve Greece's reputation for honest debate. The EC was infuriated. And Mr Mitsotakis may now be tempted to recover votes lost over Macedonia by making a premature relaxation of his correctly rigorous economic policy. That is a high price.
THERE IS A BETTER PATTERN
How much better if this shrill hyper-nationalism were sliced away from New Democracy. Usually, a two-party system is better for a country than a many-party one, because it is less liable to tie itself up in knots. But the modernisation of Greece will probably come faster in the late 1990s if there is now a period of four--or five--party politics.
On the right would be the hyper-nationalists, with maybe 10% of the vote. On the left there would be, for a time, the obstinate rump of the orthodox Communists, flat-earthers to a man (say, 3%). There will also, with luck, be the far more attractive if somewhat dreamy non-Communist radicalism of the Synaspismos movement, led by two of the most appealing politicians in the country, Maria Damanaki and Leonidas Kyrkos (maybe 6-7%).
The other 80% would be the natural battleground of New Democracy, minus its wilder nationalist fringe, and a Socialist Party stripped of its now irrelevant old left. Here would be two worthy contenders--one Thatcherite, one Rocardian--for the newly defined middle ground.
The result of the next election, due within 12 months, is a toss-up, though it is not conventional wisdom to say so. The opinion polls show the Socialists well in the lead, and their supporters are apparently twice as determined to turn out and vote on election day as New Democracy's are. But things may not be as simple as that makes them sound.
Mr Papandreou is visibly flagging, and the mass rallies and repeated television appearances of a Greek election will be a fierce test of his stamina. Mr Mitsotakis, though half a year older, and no bundle of charisma, is in much better physical shape. His party, though divided over Macedonia and the economy, is entitled to claim that its record includes nothing as bad as the Socialists' foolish first few years in power in the 1980s. It is not impossible that by election-day the memory of past Socialist errors (committed by the man still leading the party) will have eaten away Mr Papandreou's present lead, and that Mr Mitsotakis will pull off as big a surprise as the one the equally uncharismatic John Major pulled off in Britain last year.
For the most cheering news out of Greece today is that the country may at last be getting tired of the bumbly, floppy politics of the past. It shows in the opinion polls' evidence of the Greeks' growing reluctance to commit their votes to any of the present parties. It also shows in their embarrassed defensiveness when foreigners wonder aloud whether their public life is in need of change.
This is at least partly due to Greece's membership of the European Community. It is not just money--the EC's one-drachma-out-of-every-17 gift to the Greek economy--that Greece gets from its link to Western Europe. Along the link there also flows a realisation that there are more efficient ways to run a country. No European nation is satisfied with its politics at the moment, but Greece is more dissatisfied than most. Out of that dissatisfaction it may be about to build something better.","Picture a country that has two main political parties , both led by 74 - year - olds .

On September 9th the prime minister, Constantine Mitsotakis, offered his resignation and called for early elections, perhaps in October, six months before the government's term was due to end.
His two-seat majority in the 300-member parliament had been looking shaky for months. The government has been fending off attacks from senior members of its own party on everything from privatisation to foreign policy. Mr Mitsotakis's position became unsustainable when his conservative New Democracy Party lost its parliamentary majority (of one) because of the decision of a right-winger to sit as an independent
It was merely the latest in a string of defections from the ruling party since June, when a former foreign minister, Antonis Samaras, was sacked by Mr Mitsotakis. Mr Samaras left to set up his own party, called Political Spring. The issue on which he broke away was Macedonia: he has been foremost amongst the hardliners arguing that any recognition of the word ""Macedonia"" implied that the former Yugoslav republic of that name had territorial claims on the neighbouring Greek province of Macedonia. He claimed that, by accepting the name Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, the government was being too soft.
The consequences of this obscure piece of Balkan politicking are considerable. Mr Mitsotakis, whose party won an impressive 47% of the vote in the general election in 1990, is almost certain to lose the forthcoming one. Three years of economic austerity have eroded his popularity. Unemployment among young Greeks is estimated at over 20%. Hit further by a kind of Greek Watergate (in which an aide has been accused of bugging opponents' telephone calls), his popularity, say recent opinion polls, is down to 27%--the lowest recorded figure for any Greek prime minister.
The beneficiary of his woes is Andreas Papandreou, whose party, PASOK (The Panhellenic Socialist Movement), is likely to win the next election. This is a remarkable turnaround for a man whose defeat at the previous election had seemed final. His mismanagement of the economy had sent inflation and the public debt soaring. He himself has been plagued by scandal. His health has been uncertain since he underwent open-heart surgery five years ago.
An election victory for PASOK will not bring political stability. Mr Papandreou may not have the energy to run the government and there is no clear successor to take over the party. The half-dozen rivals for the PASOK leadership can be expected to spend more time jostling for position than trying to sort out the economy. Though it has seemed to renounce some of the socialist policies which failed before, PASOK has pledged to cancel the government's privatisatlon programme as soon as it comes to power. That will mean a disastrous shortfall in revenues this year. With pressure mounting to increase wages and pensions, the socialists will be unwilling to keep economic reform on track.
Greece will no longer be able to present itself as a force for stability in the Balkans. The socialists will be tempted to keep up their popularity by adopting a militantly nationalist foreign policy. That will make Greece's neighbors nervous and appal its partners in the European Community. The Greeks have little to look forward to.","The fall of the Greek government has pushed the country into political turmoil and added one more element of instability to the war - torn Balkans . On September 9th the prime minister , Constantine Mitsotakis , offered his resignation and called for early elections , perhaps in October , six months before the government 's term was due to end . 
 His two - seat majority in the 300 - member parliament had been looking shaky for months . The government has been fending off attacks from senior members of its own party on everything from privatisation to foreign policy . Mr Mitsotakis 's position became unsustainable when his conservative New Democracy Party lost its parliamentary majority ( of one ) because of the decision of a right - winger to sit as an independent 
 It was merely the latest in a string of defections from the ruling party since June , when a former foreign minister , Antonis Samaras , was sacked by Mr Mitsotakis . Mr Samaras left to set up his own party , called Political Spring . The issue on which he broke away was Macedonia : he has been foremost amongst the hardliners arguing that any recognition of the word "" Macedonia "" implied that the former Yugoslav republic of that name had territorial claims on the neighbouring Greek province of Macedonia . He claimed that , by accepting the name Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia , the government was being too soft . 
 The consequences of this obscure piece of Balkan politicking are considerable . Mr Mitsotakis , whose party won an impressive 47 % of the vote in the general election in 1990 , is almost certain to lose the forthcoming one . Three years of economic austerity have eroded his popularity . Unemployment among young Greeks is estimated at over 20 % . Hit further by a kind of Greek Watergate ( in which an aide has been accused of bugging opponents ' telephone calls ) , his popularity , say recent opinion polls , is down to 27%--the lowest recorded figure for any Greek prime minister . 
 The beneficiary of his woes is Andreas Papandreou . This is a remarkable turnaround for a man whose defeat at the previous election had seemed final . His mismanagement of the economy had sent inflation and the public debt soaring . Andreas Papandreou Papandreou has been plagued by scandal .

As voting-day on October 10th approaches, huge portraits of candidates hang from balconies; party flags criss-cross the street; leaflets carpet the pavement. Thousands of the party faithful go by bus to rallies where they let off fireworks and cheer a leader's soundbites. If this election has more substance than most, it is thanks to Greece's competitive private television channels, which have been daily interviewing top party people and airing the hot debates.
One source of heat is the economy. Constantine Mitsotakis, the prime minister and leader of the centre-right New Democracy party, promised to turn the economy round by the end of the year. There is little sign that it will happen. Inflation is down to 12.8%, the lowest figure for 20 years, but GDP growth this year will be little more than 1% (good by European standards but not Greek ones). Wages are still frozen, investment is lagging. A lot of Greeks, it is plain, are fed up with three years of austerity.
The other big issue is Mr Mitsotakis himself. He is criticised for giving the culture minister's job to his daughter, Dora Bakoyannis, a powerful figure in the New Democracy machine. He is accused of letting his wife meddle in politics. A scandal has erupted over his family's collection of Greek antiquities. Experts in the culture ministry's archaeological service say much of it comes from looted ancient graves.
The Mitsotakis government fell when two deputies left New Democracy and deprived the government of its parliamentary majority. They are now running with Political Sprin, a new party founded by Antonis Samaras, a former foreign minister whom Mr Mitsotakis calls a ""traitor"". Political Spring is expected to win about 4% of the vote, mostly dissatisfied conservatives. That would be enough to hand victory to the Socialists, led by Andreas Papandreou. The opinion polls give the Socialists around 44% of the vote, enough for a clear majority in the 300-member parliament under a system that hands out extra seats to the party that does best.
Mr Papandreou has dropped the radical rhetoric of his years in power in the 1980s. His Socialists, he argues, are now just an ordinary European social-democratic party. He is deliberately vague about policy, though it is pretty clear that there will be no return to the policy of handing out generous wage and pension rises of his first term in office. Greece will be heavily dependent on European Community money to improve its economy. The Socialists, he promises, will be responsible, and accountable.
Many voters reckon they were better off under the Socialists in the 1980s than they have been under New Democracy since then. They appear to have forgotten, or forgiven, the economic scandals that drove Mr Papandreou From office in 1989. If he were in better health, the Socialists could win big. As it is, his heart requires him to take the campaign gently: he has spoken at a few big rallies, and made some staged appearances for the television cameras. If he still coasts home on his opponents' weaknesses, and if he is stern about Greece's economic health, the country's carnival mood will soon vanish.","The Greeks like making an election into a bit of a carnival .

The Greeks' cold-war reason for mattering--they were an outpost of pluralism in an otherwise all-communist south-east Europe--is indeed over and done with. But the end of the cold war has given Greece something new, and more positive, to do. It can become the base from which the now excommunist Balkans are opened up to modern life. The Greeks themselves can provide some of the capital the region will need, as they are already handsomely doing in Bularia. Athens can be the banking centre of the Balkans. The countryside around Salonika can be dotted with multinational factories that send their products into the new markets to the north.
The trouble is that all this presupposes a Greece with a rational foreign policy and a soberly run economy of its own. Which is why last Sunday's election, bringing Andreas Papandreou and his Socialists back to power, raises Europe's eyebrows.
The foreign-policy danger is that Greece's obsession with the word ""Macedonia"" will shut it off from the world to its north. Here the fears may in fact be exaggerated. Mr Papandreou is a nationalist, as he vigorously showed in his 1981-89 prime ministership; but his nationalism was mostly of the third-worldish, flirting-with-Qaddafi sort. The primal Greek chauvinism that has caused the Macedonia trouble is chiefly a right-win affliction. Mr Papandreou, a populist to his fingertips, will doubtless sound suitably intransigent; but in practice he will, with luck, agree to share the name of Macedonia with Greece's northern neighbour, provided everybody agrees that there will be no changing of frontiers.
The economic danger is much sharper. It was the Socialists' mishandling of the economy in the 1980s--too many slapdash nationalisations, a quadrupling of the budget deficit--which more than anything else turned the Greek miracle of the 1950s and 1960s into the basket-case of the 1990s. This time, Mr Papandreou swears, he will be economically virtuous. Will he?
IF THE VIRTUE DOES NOT COME
Already, Mr Papandreou has halted the privatisation programme of the departing conservative government. Two big oil refineries, due to be sold, will stay under public ownership. Worse, the decrepit state telecoms company will not get the privatising shake-up it so badly needs. Without an efficient telephone system, Greece will never be the economic-modernisation HQ for the Balkans. Apart even from the government's need for cash, without these privatisations Greek industry will not be as competitive as it could have been.
The failure to get the deficit under control will become even worse if the new government gives way to the other demands being made of it: that it should ease the conservatives' public-sector wage squeeze, be more generous with pensions, maybe even re-expand the state workforce. Less than a year ago Greece promised the European Community that by the end of 1996 it would cut its total public-sector deficit from 9.6% of GDP to 1.9%. That was a formidable commitment; it meant achieving a large surplus in the ordinary part of the budget-7% of GDP-in order to start cutting Greece's monstrous public debt.
It was pretty unlikely that the outgoing conservatives could have done it. It is even unlikelier that the incoming Socialists will. To be fair, the Socialists will probably be better at making Greeks pay their taxes, because the worst tax-evasion offenders are not people who vote for them; that could bring in some handy extra revenue. But, all in all, it is hard to believe that an ailing prime minister who cannot work a full day and a seriously ill economics minister (see page 57) are going to shove Greece into the self-discipline needed to beat that deficit. If they do not, Greece will be a seriously ill country.
In the end, if Mr Papandreou fails, the Greek problem comes the European Community's problem. The Greeks will soon be getting almost $6 billion a year from the Community, not far short of a tenth of their national income. The EC, On its easy-going rules, will not cut its donations just because the Greek economy is going down the plughole; still less will it expel a member country, however economically delinquent. But from next year, when the second stage of its monetary union is supposed to come into effect, it can do something almost as powerful. It can publicly denounce a government that fails to keep its economy in order. Such a denunciation would in effect declare that government uncreditworthy. It may be necessary to start easing that weapon from its sheath, to persuade Greece's new government to face its economic facts.","It is not true , as too many irritated Europeans have been muttering this week , that Greece no loner matters to the rest of the world .

The familiar faces, even older now, reappear in his government. At his first cabinet meeting he says that his Socialist party will turn back the privatisation clock to where it stood in the 1980s. The first days after last Sunday's election may not provide a true picture of the next four years, but they have been more than a little eerie.
The Socialists had been expected to beat the conservative New Democracy government, but not quite so convincingly. Mr Papandreou, now 74, managed to put behind him the financial and personal scandals that brought down his previous administration. Frail though he is, his handful of campaign appearances had much of the old charm, and more than a touch of the old populism. His party won 46.996 of the vote to New Democracy's 39.396; the latter lost votes to Political Spring, a conservative splinter-group led by a former foreign minister, Antonis Samaras, which finished with 4.9%, just ahead of the Communists still fervently Stalinist--who got 4.5%. The other voice of the left, Left Alliance, got 2.9%, just short of the 3% needed to win any seats.
The size of his victory makes it possible for Mr Papandreou to have a full four-year term in office. Most people had thought that another election would have to be held in the spring of 1995, when parliament is due to elect a new president to succeed 86-year-old Constantine Karamanlis. At least 180 votes, out of parliament's 300, are needed to elect a president. If the Socialists can add the Communists' nine seats to their own 171, their joint candidate could become president and Mr Papandreou, if he is up to it, could stay on as prime minister without a mid-term election.
Is he up to it? His health has been poor since a heart operation in 1988. He apparently cannot work at full stretch for more than a few hours a day. The demands on him will increase when Greece takes over the European Community's presidency in January. Mr Papandreou has made few trips abroad in the past couple of years. He may not even be able to make the rounds of the Community's capitals before next June's Corfu summit.
Despite this, no deputy prime minister has been appointed. Mr Papandreou has given the main cabinet jobs to old and trusted allies. His economy minister will be George Gennimatas, who has cancer. Dimitris Tsovolas, a former finance minister found guilty of corruption while in office, is to return to government. Mr Papandreou's wife is to run his private office. His pledge to
undo the ""wrongs committed by the right"" suggests that there may be yet another purge of the civil service, bringing back some of the placement who lost their jobs when the Socialists left office in 1989.
There is a flavour of revenue in all this that hardly fits in with Mr Papandreou's attempt to present himself as a moderate, proEuropean social democrat. His party officials say that the radical days are over. Relations with the Americans and NATO will go smoothly this time, they claim (though it is not easy to square this with Mr Papandreou's insistence that Greece will not recognise the former Yuoslav republic of Macedonia under any name that includes Macedonia).
Greece has promised to reform its economy to meet the terms of the Maastricht treaty. That means brining down the still alarming public-sector deficit and cutting inflation (at 12.8%, more than three times the EC average). This will be hard to do if Mr Papandreou carries out his threat to cancel the privatisation programme, and rewards his voters with wage and pension increases. He will come under strong pressure from the European Commission if the Greek economy starts to drift off course. Here, perhaps, is the central confrontation of his new prime ministership.","It is , in many ways , like a journey in time , taking you back to yesterday 's Greece . Andreas Papandreou is prime minister again . 
 The familiar faces , even older now , reappear in Andreas Papandreou's government . At Andreas Papandreou's first cabinet meeting Andreas Papandreou says that Andreas Papandreou's Socialist party will turn back the privatisation clock to where it stood in the 1980s . The first days after last Sunday 's election may not provide a true picture of the next four years , but they have been more than a little eerie . 
 The Socialists had been expected to beat the conservative New Democracy government , but not quite so convincingly . Andreas Papandreou , managed to put behind Andreas Papandreou the financial and personal scandals that brought down Andreas Papandreou's previous administration . Frail though Andreas Papandreou is , Andreas Papandreou's handful of campaign appearances had much of the old charm , and more than a touch of the old populism . Andreas Papandreou's party won 46.996 of the vote to New Democracy 's 39.396 ; the latter lost votes to Political Spring , a conservative splinter - group led by a former foreign minister , Antonis Samaras , which finished with 4.9 % , just ahead of the Communists still fervently Stalinist -- who got 4.5 % . The other voice of the left , Left Alliance , got 2.9 % , just short of the 3 % needed to win any seats . 
 The size of Andreas Papandreou's victory makes it possible for Andreas Papandreou to have a full four - year term in office . Most people had thought that another election would have to be held in the spring of 1995 , when parliament is due to elect a new president to succeed 86 - year - old Constantine Karamanlis . At least 180 votes , out of parliament 's 300 , are needed to elect a president . If the Socialists can add the Communists ' nine seats to their own 171 , their joint candidate could become president and Andreas Papandreou , if Andreas Papandreou is up to it , could stay on as prime minister without a mid - term election . 
 Is Andreas Papandreou up to it ? Andreas Papandreou's health has been poor since a heart operation in 1988 . Andreas Papandreou apparently can not work at full stretch for more than a few hours a day . The demands on Andreas Papandreou will increase when Greece takes over the European Community 's presidency in January . Andreas Papandreou has made few trips abroad in the past couple of years . Andreas Papandreou may not even be able to make the rounds of the Community 's capitals before next June 's Corfu summit . 
 Despite this , no deputy prime minister has been appointed . Andreas Papandreou has given the main cabinet jobs to old and trusted allies . Andreas Papandreou's economy minister will be George Gennimatas , who has cancer . Dimitris Tsovolas , a former finance minister found guilty of corruption while in office , is to return to government . Andreas Papandreou's wife is to run Andreas Papandreou's private office . Andreas Papandreou's pledge to 
 undo the "" wrongs committed by the right "" suggests that there may be yet another purge of the civil service , bringing back some of the placement who lost their jobs when the Socialists left office in 1989 . 
 There is a flavour of revenue in all this that hardly fits in with Andreas Papandreou's attempt to present Andreas Papandreou as a moderate , proEuropean social democrat . Andreas Papandreou's party officials say that the radical days are over . Relations with the Americans and NATO will go smoothly this time , they claim ( though it is not easy to square this with Andreas Papandreou's insistence that Greece will not recognise the former Yuoslav republic of Macedonia under any name that includes Macedonia ) . 
 Greece has promised to reform its economy to meet the terms of the Maastricht treaty . That means brining down the still alarming public - sector deficit and cutting inflation ( at 12.8 % , more than three times the EC average ) . This will be hard to do if Andreas Papandreou carries out Andreas Papandreou's threat to cancel the privatisation programme , and rewards Andreas Papandreou's voters with wage and pension increases . Andreas Papandreou will come under strong pressure from the European Commission if the Greek economy starts to drift off course .

It has two summits--that on October 29th and another due on December 10th---to:
* decide what to do about stage two of the increasingly implausible economic and monetary union (EMU), supposed to start on January 1st 1994;
* push through an economic-recovery plan which is being drawn up by the European Commission;
* decide what, if anything, the Community can do as the war in former Yugoslavia enters its third winter.
Whether it can tackle this daunting agenda depends in part on the effectiveness of the Belgian government, which holds the EC's rotating presidency. The Belgians can take comfort from the fact that, whatever is decided in the two months that remain of their presidency, others will take the blame if things go wrong later. The Community's members take it in six-monthly turns to preside over the Council of Ministers, the main decision-taking body. Belgium's stint ends on December 31st.
The country that holds the presidency may not have much power, but while it is in charge it literally sets the agenda, choosing what the EC discusses, or fails to discuss. Belgium, for instance, has told its partners that the mainly Franco-American squabble over the Blair House deal on farm subsidies will not be formally discussed at the October summit--which will therefore be calmer, but less interesting, than it would otherwise have been.
The Buggins's-turn principle works like this. The presidency is handed on in alphabetical order, according to what each country calls itself: Belie/Belgique is followed by Danmark, Deutschland, Ellas, Espana, down to the United Kingdom. At Maastricht, EC leaders, fearing this was too simple, decided it would be nice to invert each pair of countries, so that those doomed by their initials to presidencies in the second half of the year could hold their farewell summits (and parties) in flaming June rather than in dreary December. So this year Denmark came before Belgium, and in 1994 Greece bumps Germany into the second half of the year.
It was probably no bad thing that the Danes were in the presidency while the second referendum on Maastricht was held there last May. To avoid anything that might remotely upset Danish voters, they kept the Community in suspended animation for five months. The forthcoming presidencies, in contrast, seem likely to lead to ructions. The Greeks have just re-elected Andreas Papandreou, now sick and elderly. The government he heads is Europe's most profligate and interventionist, and takes the hot seat just as the Community is supposed to start implementing policies to cut labour costs and deregulate markets.
Moreover, the start of 1994 is meant to bring into action the common foreign and security policy set up under the Maastricht deal. Greece has been almost paranoid about the name Macedonia, and is more pro-Serb than any other EC country. It is not likely to be impartial on Balkan matters, which is especially awkward since the presidential country takes the chair not only at summits but in committees of all kinds.
The Germans can usually be relied upon to provide an effective presidency. But their tour of duty, postponed to the second half of 1994, will coincide with parliamentary elections. Helmut Kohl and the rest will not have their attention on Brussels until October, when the vote will be out of the way, and perhaps some of them with it. As for the first half of 1995, the French presidency will be overshadowed by the domestic battle to replace President Mitterrand.
Most EC leaders believed at Maastricht that they were spurring the Community to a gallop. Instead, by fiddling with the rules for the rotating presidency, they hobbled their horse.","With the Maastricht treaty entering on November 1st , the European Community is already looking to sort out some of its post - Maastricht muddles .

Mr Papandreou says there will be co-operation, not confrontation, with the European Community and the United States. Instead of threatening to nationalise Greek businesses, he is wooing them with promises of more EC-financed grants for industry. Does it ring true?
Apart from Mr Papandreou's newfound enthusiasm for the Clinton administration, not very. The prime minister has accepted an invitation to visit Washington, something his party's radicals would never have allowed when the Socialists were last in power. But this does not mean much. The end of the cold war has removed most of the military bases that were the pretext for the Socialists' old anti-Americanism. The Americans now want the Greeks to be less fractious towards their Balkan neighbours.
Here the prospects are, at best, mixed. Greece's relations with Albania have rarely been worse. The conservative government that lost the election on October 10th frightened Albania's president, Sali Berisha, by talking about autonomy for the Greek minority in southern Albania. In retaliation, Albania is cutting the number of schools where the children of Greek families can be taught in Greek. Ugly incidents on the border are now more frequent. The Socialists hope that the Clinton people--who are on good terms with Mr Berisha--will help to patch things up. This could bring more cross-border investment by Greek companies.
But Greek intransigence over Macedonia cancels out that hope. Mr Papandreou says he will break off the talks designed to agree upon a name for the relevant part of what used to be Yugoslavia: ""I wish to reiterate our decision not to recognise this state by a name which would include the word Macedonia, or any derivative thereof."" Adding threatened injury to insult, members of his cabinet say that land-locked Macedonia cannot survive if it loses access to the northern Greek port of Salonika.
Such attitudes will cause problems with the European Community as well as with America. Greece holds the presidency of the EC in the first half of next year. The rest of the Community will want the Papandreou government to be an impartial chairman in matters concerning the Balkans. That seems unlikely over Macedonia. It may also be difficult with Serbia, the country most non-Greeks think is chiefly to blame for the horrors in ex-Yugoslavia. Mr Papandreou is as keen to be on good terms with Serbia's president, Slobodan Milosevic, as was his conservative predecessor.
Greece's crumbling economy will add to the friction with the EC. Warnings have already been sounded in Brussels that new measures are needed to stop Greece's budget deficit getting out of control. Unless something is done quickly, this year's government borrowing requirement will reach 14.4% of GDP, almost twice the official forecast of 7.9%.
A mist of unreality hangs over the Socialists' economic policy. To finance the deficit, they must raise interest rates enough to tempt investors to put their money into government bonds. But Giorgos Gennimatas, the economy minister, insists that interest rates must come down by Christmas. This, he claims, will help to control inflation (still more than three times the EC average), and encourage private investment.
Mr Gennimatas has already promised that wages will keep pace with inflation next year. He says there will be no new taxes. Instead, he is counting on a last-minute crackdown on tax evasion to produce more revenue by December. The crackdown is aimed at the same businessmen he pledges to help. The old rhetoric may have gone, but the Socialist party is still its old self.","Since Andreas Papandreou were voted back into government a month ago , Andreas Papandreou's have been trying to convince both Andreas Papandreou's western allies and Greece 's own businessmen that Andreas Papandreou have dumped the radicalism of Andreas Papandreou's previous term in office , in the 1980s .

In May 1967, at the age of 74, he won a dividend of Ptas1m ($17,000) with a coupon signed ""Francisco Franco"", on which he gave his address merely as ""El Pardo, Madrid"". His addiction to television permitting (he had several sets installed around the Pardo), he also continued to take cabinet meetings even after he had begun to forget the faces of his own ministers. According to his biographer, Paul Preston, political intimates ""tacitly agreed to behave as if Franco was still entirely in control"" for fear of losing their own jobs in any succession. After all, they reasoned, ""the Caudillo did function normally for much of the time"".
The modern panoply of high political office can shield the incumbent from many if not all of the petty outrages and humiliations of everyday life. As the leader grows old, the entourage of advisers and bodyguards, speechwriters and public-relations men can offer no proof against the more private symptoms of mortal decay; it supplies nonetheless the best possible prosthesis. However sick or forgetful, tired or deranged the leader may be, the government machinery that encloses his frail body like an iron lung continues to tell the world only of his rude health and daunting lucidity. It does this so well that the principal may believe its lies himself.
Understandably, leaders tend--given the chance--to cling to office too long, and preferably until death. The older they grow, the more they dread a retirement that is ever more starkly an antechamber to their tomb. Of course it helps that, being leaders, they can write their own rules. Probably every country having any pretensions to constitutionality sets a minimum age for acceding to high public office, but none sets a maximum. The fate of a nation may thus rest with utter propriety in hands so trembling that they cannot lift a glass of wine or pair of chopsticks without catastrophe.
In democracies at least, society conspires in the illusion that politicians do not age like everyone else. A man in his 70s or 80s is unlikely to be a paragon of physical energy or intellectual invention. The reasons why most other adults are obliged--or choose--to retire in late middle age ought in logic to apply with equal force to those who run countries; the more so, given the strains and responsibilities of their task. Yet the ""suspension of disbelief"", to borrow a term from literary criticism, is periodically allowed to prevail. Power is given to men who in strictly actuarial terms ought already to be dead.
Why do voters not demand the retirement of their leaders at some reliably competent age? One reason (no doubt preferred by old leaders themselves) is that old people are credited with special reserves of wisdom which are peculiarly appropriate to the work of leadership--but which are not, apparently, considered appropriate to other work on which lives might depend, such as brain-surgery or air-traffic control. As to the source of that wisdom, the mystically-minded might say that the old derived it from being closer to God; the merely practical that they had seen more of life and learned more of its lessons. But Shakespeare's ""King Lear"" offered a fierce counter-argument to such sentimentality. Lear's wisdom proved no more than arrogance aggravated by flattery. Stripped of his court, the king--like any other old person--was naked before the immanent perils of sickness, madness and death.
Which is not to say that every old person (taking ""old"" to mean, say, over 70 for a person in poor health and over 75 for a person in good health) is prone to mental or physical breakdown or liable to go howling at the wind along Dover's cliffs; merely that the average 75-8O-year-old is going to be a great deal more vulnerable to mental and physical weakness or illness than the average 45-50-year-old. And, whatever official spokesmen may claim or cheering crowds believe, posthumous diaries and memoirs show that old leaders conform to that rule.
CLOSER TO GOD
In very old and purely oral societies, where leadership approximated more to a priestly than to a political function, the kinship between power and age was much more obvious and natural. The oldest safeguarded the lore of the clan and laid claim to a deeper knowledge of the world and its mysteries. Societies ruled by religion also privilege the old (though Messiahs themselves are usually young), choosing as their mediators between this world and the next those whom age has already brought closest to the afterlife. The cardinals of the Roman Catholic church have almost always elected old men as their popes: Agathon was supposedly 103 at the start of his papacy in 678, Celestine III died in the siege of Rome in 1198 at the age of 92 and Pope Leo XIII expired in office seven centuries later at 93.
The notion of a special relationship between old people and the gods may also help to explain why myth-makers and chroniclers often exaggerated the ages of ancient leaders to impossible extremes. The first three mythical kings of Sumer, A-lulim, Alalgar and En Men Lu Anna, were said to have reigned for 28,000 years, 36,000 years and 43,200 years respectively, a global all-time record which puts in new perspective the contemporary notion of dix ans, ca suffit. In a similar fashion, antediluvian biblical figures were credited with much longer lives than those who came after: Adam 930 years, Seth 912, Enos 905, Jared 962, Methusaleh 969, Noah 950. But Shem; Noah's son, lived a mere 600 years, Abraham 175, Isaac 180, Jacob 147 and Joseph an almost believable 110.
The antique and religious reverence for age is far from dead. It was visible in 1979 in the choice of a 78-year-old cleric, Ayatollah Khomeini, as the Islamic Republic of Iran's first head of state--and with power for life. But, more often than not, very old rulers in the present century have owed their fortune less to the blessing of the goods and more to the decadence of communist government. Not because communism has been uniquely disposed to vesting power in old men; modern fascism and democracy have also done the same. More because communism, with its huge bureaucratic power-structures and hostile cliques, has proved particularly vulnerable to the blocking of whole institutions and hierarchical tiers with doddering cadres who decline to retire and seemingly cannot be compelled to do so.
When the old guard of the Chinese Communist Party met secretly in May 1989 to authorise the June 4th assault on Tiananmen Square, there was nobody under 75 around the table. In the Soviet Union just before Yuri Andropov's death in 1984, six of the 11 members of the Politburo were over 70 and only one (Mikhail Gorbachev) younger than 60. The lesser communist leaderships have modelled themselves on the greater: Kim Il Sung of North Korea is 81; Vietnam an Laos are run by septuagenarians; and Fidel Castro, 66, doubtless hopes that Cuba will soon be as well. When communism began collapsing across the East European satellite states in 1989, the average age of leaders there was 76 and the mean duration of their rule 27 years. To quote Jerrold Post and Robert Robins, authors of ""When Illness Strikes the Leader"", such figures spoke ""not of stability but of stagnation"".
The weakness of a political system ruled by old men revealed itself most painfully in the succession to Leonid Brezhnev, who died in office in 1982 at 75. Brezhnev had been elected Communist Party general secretary in 1964 and was for his first decade a boisterous, outgoing leader. But in 1975-77 he suffered two serious strokes, and a pacemaker was fitted to his heart. His speech became slurred, his hands shook, and he spent long periods in secret clinics. According to Boris Yeltsin, ""In the last phase of his life, Brezhnev...had no idea what he was doing, saying or signing. All the power was in the hands of his entourage."" Yet only death removed Brezhnev from the Kremlin.
Andropov, anointed leader in November 1982 at the age of 68, seemed a youthful figure by comparison with his predecessor. He proved to be seriously ill with kidney disease and died after 15 months in office, six of them spent in hospital. The Politburo then elevated Konstantin Chernenko, who was, at 72, younger but iller than the rest of the old guard--Andrei Gromyko (73), Dimitri Ustinov (74) and Nikolai Tikhonov (77).
BETTER RED THAN DEAD
Chernenko was barely capable of saluting the troops at his inaugural march-past. Attempting to give a public speech on foreign policy in March 1984, he mumbled, wheezed, stuttered and skipped a page of text (the one containing the central point of his speech) without noticing. After he had grunted and dozed his way through a party congress in June, his speeches were read by others on his behalf. He died in March 1985, an autopsy recording chronic emphysema, congestive heart failure and cirrhosis of the liver. Only then, after three state funerals in 30 months, did power pass to a new generation in the person of Mr Gorbachev.
Because the Chinese Communist Party of the 1970s was an even more opaque institution than its Russian counterpart, the deterioration of its own leader, Mao Zedong, was more completely hidden than that of Brezhnev. By 1974, the 80-year-old Mao was suffering from Parkinson's disease, impaired kidney function, poor circulation and thickening cataracts which left him blind for more than a year until surgeons judged him operable. He could not speak comprehensibly, nor walk more than a few steps, nor lift food to his mouth with chopsticks --yet he would not allow the government of China to function without him. He intervened randomly in state affairs from his sick-bed, chewing tea-leaves for lucidity and sleeping-pills for release. The country around him relapsed into a chaos from which it emerged only in 1978, two years after Mao's death, with the rise to power of Den Xiaoping, 74.
Mr Deng is still, at 89, the patriarch of China, at least as powerful as Mao was in his own day. He no longer holds any executive post but is deferred to by those who do. (Strictly, Mr Deng is thus disqualified as world record-holder for age-in-office. That title rested until recently with Felix Houphouet-Boigny, who died on December 7th after 33 years as president of Cote d'Ivoire. Though his age was officially given as 88, Mr Houphouet-Boigny was reputed to be up to seven years older. The palm passes to Hastings Banda, officially 97, president of Malawi since 1966 and president-for-life since 1971.) Mr Deng is periodically reported to be suffering from various forms of cancer and from Parkinson's disease. In his rare public appearances (there have been none since June) he has walked only with the aid of nurses and has required the help of his daughters to make his slurred speech comprehensible to others.
It is easy, and true, to say that communism has been doomed to produce such dysfunctionally aged leaders because, in common with other forms of dictatorship, its governments (and still more its peoples) lack effective institutionalised ways of removing them. Worse, by the time a leader has grown old and weak enough to be toppled against his will, he has probably also passed into the control of an entourage that depends for its own power upon his survival, and which will fight to keep him nominally in office by any means available. The doctors at Mao's deathbed had orders ""to prolong [his] life regardless of discomfort to the patient"", according to a posthumous biography, written by Harrison Salisbury.
But communist leadership appears to present special problems of transmissibility over and above those afflicting dictators in general. Communist leaders have traditionally based their claims to legitimacy on their parts in the revolutions that brought them to power (or, in the case of later Russian leaders, the second world war). Younger leaders unblooded by such fundamental conflicts have not survived long. Perhaps the communist who rules a nation must be--like Mr Deng or Mr Castro--a proven warrior able to command the army's instinctive obedience.
Recent events invite a further explanation: that only those leaders who have swum through blood in their early lives, and sincerely believe themselves to have saved their countries by doing so, can hold in reserve the degree of fanaticism periodically needed to enforce totalitarian rule. Deng Xiaoping ordered the massacre of hundreds, if necessary thousands, of demonstrators in Tiananmen Square in 1989. It was a price he believed was worth paying for another generation of Communist dictatorship. Erich Honecker (then 77) would have acted similarly in East Germany that same year when faced with a challenge to his own dictatorship. He was overruled by Mr Gorbachev, a younger leader untempered by war or revolution--and so the collapse of western communism began.
SICK TRANSIT
For all its fetishising of muscular and fertile youth, modern fascism would surely have produced its own crop of jackbooted octogenarians had the second world war gone its way--just as its Iberian offshoot produced two leaders-for-life in the form of Antonio Salazar (deposed in 1968 at the age of 69) and Franco (who died in office at 82). The short span of Hitler's National Socialism allowed leaders of pensionable age to appear only in supporting roles. President Paul von Hindenburg failed to resist Hitler's rise in Germany, and Marshal Philippe Petain helped cloak the fascist interest in the guise of French nationalism.
Hindenburg was 85 in 1932, when he rescinded a ban on Nazi paramilitary forces and set the stage for Hitler's elevation to chancellor. The Prussian premier, Otto Braun, said of Hindenburg that he ""seemed so terribly senile that my anger at his decree was outweighed by my sympathy for the old man"". Post-war French sentiment was similarly divided over Petain's conduct. Lucid enough in 1940 when parliament voted him plenary powers at the age of 84, he was drifting into senility by the time of his trial in 1945. Many preferred to believe that he had failed to perceive or understand the true horror of his Nazi sponsors.
The post-war democracies have tended to choose rule by the middle-aged, electing few leaders of more than 70 or less than 4O. Laurent Fabius was named prime minister of France at 37 in 1984, a West European record, but he was chosen (from a number of eligible candidates) by President Mitterrand and not by French voters. The Polish prime minister, Waldemar Pawlak, 34, is also a presidential appointee. His rise reflects a more general skewing of political authority in Eastern Europe towards the young, after the disgrace of the communist political establishment.
Lurches towards age have tended to occur where leaders have been returned for subsequent terms of office, having already established their fitness to rule in the mind of the electorate. Thus Winston Churchill, his bulldog image eternal and immutable, was elected prime minister of Britain in 1951 at the age of 77 after six years in opposition. Ronald Reagan, already unusually old when elected president of the United States in 1980 at 69, was re-elected for a second four-year term in 1984. Francois Mitterrand, elected president of France in 1981 at the age of 64, was returned for a second seven-year term in 1988, which could keep him in office until the age of 78. Andreas Papandreou was re-elected prime minister of Greece in October this year at the age of 74, four years after the collapse of his previous government.
Of these four septuagenarians, Mr Mitterrand appears from simple observation to have been the fittest and most alert in office, at least until the announcement in September 1992 of his prostate cancer. (He also suffered a short vomiting fit during a trip to South Korea earlier this year). At the other extreme, those close to Churchill have told in graphic detail both of his serious health problems and of their systematic concealment from the public.
Messrs Post and Robins record that by 1951 Churchill was virtually a ""walking text-book of pathology. Scarcely an organ system remained unaffected. He had significant illnesses affecting his heart, brain, lungs, gastrointestinal tract, skin and eyes. His medical history included several attacks of pneumonia, a heart attack, a major stroke, two episodes of cerebral ischemia, diverticulitis, inflammation affecting the eyes, eczema, and intermittent severe depression."" When he suffered a second major stroke in June 1953, incapacitating him for five days, an official statement said merely that ""the prime minister has had no respite for a long time from his very arduous duties and is in need of a complete rest."" Churchill's doctor, Lord Moran, recorded in his diary that Churchill ""will never again be the same man...He is really living on a volcano."" But Churchill remained prime minister for another two years while his government worried about the succession and policy drifted.
President Reagan was the most popular elderly leader of modern times, probably because American voters wanted precisely what they got: a man whom age inclined to take a less excitable and more detached view of government, who preferred simple verities to complex rationalisations. Also, Mr Reagan came relatively late to power rather than growing old in its clutches. Perhaps this is why he was more genuinely willing --even keen--to delegate decision-making, and less prone to the paranoia which has gripped most other ageing leaders.
Mr Reagan was professionally skilled at role-playing, which must have helped. But even the oldest of career politicians can manage a pastiche of themselves for public consumption when elections or other great events come round. This appears to be all that the public demands, ignoring the statistical likelihood that the greatest of minds must fade and the noblest of hearts clog. Even while the leader remains well, he will have an old person's habits of mind, growing more stubborn and more rigid in his approach to any problem. His affectations of simplicity will signal not the wisdom of age but merely a shallowness of understanding, a disposition to see the present and future solely in terms of the past.
Just occasionally, when a problem proves unexpectedly susceptible to a simple approach, the old leader may succeed. Mr Reagan's insistence on confronting Russian communism may be a case in point. More often, however, the old leader is merely the cypher that one would suppose. The safest moral is that when politicians hunger for office, their own fitness to hold it will rank last among their concerns.","Generalisimo Franco was a keen player of the football pools in his later years . In May 1967 , at the age of 74 , he won a dividend of Ptas1 m ( $ 17,000 ) with a coupon signed "" Francisco Franco "" , on which he gave his address merely as "" El Pardo , Madrid "" . His addiction to television permitting ( he had several sets installed around the Pardo ) , he also continued to take cabinet meetings even after he had begun to forget the faces of his own ministers . According to his biographer , Paul Preston , political intimates "" tacitly agreed to behave as if Franco was still entirely in control "" for fear of losing their own jobs in any succession . After all , they reasoned , "" the Caudillo did function normally for much of the time "" . 
 The modern panoply of high political office can shield the incumbent from many if not all of the petty outrages and humiliations of everyday life . As the leader grows old , the entourage of advisers and bodyguards , speechwriters and public - relations men can offer no proof against the more private symptoms of mortal decay ; it supplies nonetheless the best possible prosthesis . However sick or forgetful , tired or deranged the leader may be , the government machinery that encloses his frail body like an iron lung continues to tell the world only of his rude health and daunting lucidity . It does this so well that the principal may believe its lies himself . 
 Understandably , leaders tend -- given the chance -- to cling to office too long , and preferably until death . The older they grow , the more they dread a retirement that is ever more starkly an antechamber to their tomb . Of course it helps that , being leaders , they can write their own rules . Probably every country having any pretensions to constitutionality sets a minimum age for acceding to high public office , but none sets a maximum . The fate of a nation may thus rest with utter propriety in hands so trembling that they can not lift a glass of wine or pair of chopsticks without catastrophe . 
 In democracies at least , society conspires in the illusion that politicians do not age like everyone else . A man in his 70s or 80s is unlikely to be a paragon of physical energy or intellectual invention . The reasons why most other adults are obliged -- or choose -- to retire in late middle age ought in logic to apply with equal force to those who run countries ; the more so , given the strains and responsibilities of their task . Yet the "" suspension of disbelief "" , to borrow a term from literary criticism , is periodically allowed to prevail . Power is given to men who in strictly actuarial terms ought already to be dead . 
 Why do voters not demand the retirement of their leaders at some reliably competent age ? One reason ( no doubt preferred by old leaders themselves ) is that old people are credited with special reserves of wisdom which are peculiarly appropriate to the work of leadership -- but which are not , apparently , considered appropriate to other work on which lives might depend , such as brain - surgery or air - traffic control . As to the source of that wisdom , the mystically - minded might say that the old derived it from being closer to God ; the merely practical that they had seen more of life and learned more of its lessons . But Shakespeare 's "" King Lear "" offered a fierce counter - argument to such sentimentality . Lear 's wisdom proved no more than arrogance aggravated by flattery . Stripped of his court , the king -- like any other old person -- was naked before the immanent perils of sickness , madness and death . 
 Which is not to say that every old person ( taking "" old "" to mean , say , over 70 for a person in poor health and over 75 for a person in good health ) is prone to mental or physical breakdown or liable to go howling at the wind along Dover 's cliffs ; merely that the average 75 - 8O - year - old is going to be a great deal more vulnerable to mental and physical weakness or illness than the average 45 - 50 - year - old . And , whatever official spokesmen may claim or cheering crowds believe , posthumous diaries and memoirs show that old leaders conform to that rule . 
 CLOSER TO GOD 
 In very old and purely oral societies , where leadership approximated more to a priestly than to a political function , the kinship between power and age was much more obvious and natural . The oldest safeguarded the lore of the clan and laid claim to a deeper knowledge of the world and its mysteries . Societies ruled by religion also privilege the old ( though Messiahs themselves are usually young ) , choosing as their mediators between this world and the next those whom age has already brought closest to the afterlife . The cardinals of the Roman Catholic church have almost always elected old men as their popes : Agathon was supposedly 103 at the start of his papacy in 678 , Celestine III died in the siege of Rome in 1198 at the age of 92 and Pope Leo XIII expired in office seven centuries later at 93 . 
 The notion of a special relationship between old people and the gods may also help to explain why myth - makers and chroniclers often exaggerated the ages of ancient leaders to impossible extremes . The first three mythical kings of Sumer , A - lulim , Alalgar and En Men Lu Anna , were said to have reigned for 28,000 years , 36,000 years and 43,200 years respectively , a global all - time record which puts in new perspective the contemporary notion of dix ans , ca suffit . In a similar fashion , antediluvian biblical figures were credited with much longer lives than those who came after : Adam 930 years , Seth 912 , Enos 905 , Jared 962 , Methusaleh 969 , Noah 950 . But Shem ; Noah 's son , lived a mere 600 years , Abraham 175 , Isaac 180 , Jacob 147 and Joseph an almost believable 110 . 
 The antique and religious reverence for age is far from dead . It was visible in 1979 in the choice of a 78 - year - old cleric , Ayatollah Khomeini , as the Islamic Republic of Iran 's first head of state -- and with power for life . But , more often than not , very old rulers in the present century have owed their fortune less to the blessing of the goods and more to the decadence of communist government . Not because communism has been uniquely disposed to vesting power in old men ; modern fascism and democracy have also done the same . More because communism , with its huge bureaucratic power - structures and hostile cliques , has proved particularly vulnerable to the blocking of whole institutions and hierarchical tiers with doddering cadres who decline to retire and seemingly can not be compelled to do so . 
 When the old guard of the Chinese Communist Party met secretly in May 1989 to authorise the June 4th assault on Tiananmen Square , there was nobody under 75 around the table . In the Soviet Union just before Yuri Andropov 's death in 1984 , six of the 11 members of the Politburo were over 70 and only one ( Mikhail Gorbachev ) younger than 60 . The lesser communist leaderships have modelled themselves on the greater : Kim Il Sung of North Korea is 81 ; Vietnam an Laos are run by septuagenarians ; and Fidel Castro , 66 , doubtless hopes that Cuba will soon be as well . When communism began collapsing across the East European satellite states in 1989 , the average age of leaders there was 76 and the mean duration of their rule 27 years . To quote Jerrold Post and Robert Robins , authors of "" When Illness Strikes the Leader "" , such figures spoke "" not of stability but of stagnation "" . 
 The weakness of a political system ruled by old men revealed itself most painfully in the succession to Leonid Brezhnev , who died in office in 1982 at 75 . Brezhnev had been elected Communist Party general secretary in 1964 and was for his first decade a boisterous , outgoing leader . But in 1975 - 77 he suffered two serious strokes , and a pacemaker was fitted to his heart . His speech became slurred , his hands shook , and he spent long periods in secret clinics . According to Boris Yeltsin , "" In the last phase of his life , Brezhnev ... had no idea what he was doing , saying or signing . All the power was in the hands of his entourage . "" Yet only death removed Brezhnev from the Kremlin . 
 Andropov , anointed leader in November 1982 at the age of 68 , seemed a youthful figure by comparison with his predecessor . He proved to be seriously ill with kidney disease and died after 15 months in office , six of them spent in hospital . The Politburo then elevated Konstantin Chernenko , who was , at 72 , younger but iller than the rest of the old guard -- Andrei Gromyko ( 73 ) , Dimitri Ustinov ( 74 ) and Nikolai Tikhonov ( 77 ) . 
 BETTER RED THAN DEAD 
 Chernenko was barely capable of saluting the troops at his inaugural march - past . Attempting to give a public speech on foreign policy in March 1984 , he mumbled , wheezed , stuttered and skipped a page of text ( the one containing the central point of his speech ) without noticing . After he had grunted and dozed his way through a party congress in June , his speeches were read by others on his behalf . He died in March 1985 , an autopsy recording chronic emphysema , congestive heart failure and cirrhosis of the liver . Only then , after three state funerals in 30 months , did power pass to a new generation in the person of Mr Gorbachev . 
 Because the Chinese Communist Party of the 1970s was an even more opaque institution than its Russian counterpart , the deterioration of its own leader , Mao Zedong , was more completely hidden than that of Brezhnev . By 1974 , the 80 - year - old Mao was suffering from Parkinson 's disease , impaired kidney function , poor circulation and thickening cataracts which left him blind for more than a year until surgeons judged him operable . He could not speak comprehensibly , nor walk more than a few steps , nor lift food to his mouth with chopsticks --yet he would not allow the government of China to function without him . He intervened randomly in state affairs from his sick - bed , chewing tea - leaves for lucidity and sleeping - pills for release . The country around him relapsed into a chaos from which it emerged only in 1978 , two years after Mao 's death , with the rise to power of Den Xiaoping , 74 . 
 Mr Deng is still , at 89 , the patriarch of China , at least as powerful as Mao was in his own day . He no longer holds any executive post but is deferred to by those who do . ( Strictly , Mr Deng is thus disqualified as world record - holder for age - in - office . That title rested until recently with Felix Houphouet - Boigny , who died on December 7th after 33 years as president of Cote d'Ivoire . Though his age was officially given as 88 , Mr Houphouet - Boigny was reputed to be up to seven years older . The palm passes to Hastings Banda , officially 97 , president of Malawi since 1966 and president - for - life since 1971 . ) Mr Deng is periodically reported to be suffering from various forms of cancer and from Parkinson 's disease . In his rare public appearances ( there have been none since June ) he has walked only with the aid of nurses and has required the help of his daughters to make his slurred speech comprehensible to others . 
 It is easy , and true , to say that communism has been doomed to produce such dysfunctionally aged leaders because , in common with other forms of dictatorship , its governments ( and still more its peoples ) lack effective institutionalised ways of removing them . Worse , by the time a leader has grown old and weak enough to be toppled against his will , he has probably also passed into the control of an entourage that depends for its own power upon his survival , and which will fight to keep him nominally in office by any means available . The doctors at Mao 's deathbed had orders "" to prolong [ his ] life regardless of discomfort to the patient "" , according to a posthumous biography , written by Harrison Salisbury . 
 But communist leadership appears to present special problems of transmissibility over and above those afflicting dictators in general . Communist leaders have traditionally based their claims to legitimacy on their parts in the revolutions that brought them to power ( or , in the case of later Russian leaders , the second world war ) . Younger leaders unblooded by such fundamental conflicts have not survived long . Perhaps the communist who rules a nation must be -- like Mr Deng or Mr Castro -- a proven warrior able to command the army 's instinctive obedience . 
 Recent events invite a further explanation : that only those leaders who have swum through blood in their early lives , and sincerely believe themselves to have saved their countries by doing so , can hold in reserve the degree of fanaticism periodically needed to enforce totalitarian rule . Deng Xiaoping ordered the massacre of hundreds , if necessary thousands , of demonstrators in Tiananmen Square in 1989 . It was a price he believed was worth paying for another generation of Communist dictatorship . Erich Honecker ( then 77 ) would have acted similarly in East Germany that same year when faced with a challenge to his own dictatorship . He was overruled by Mr Gorbachev , a younger leader untempered by war or revolution -- and so the collapse of western communism began . 
 SICK TRANSIT 
 For all its fetishising of muscular and fertile youth , modern fascism would surely have produced its own crop of jackbooted octogenarians had the second world war gone its way -- just as its Iberian offshoot produced two leaders - for - life in the form of Antonio Salazar ( deposed in 1968 at the age of 69 ) and Franco ( who died in office at 82 ) . The short span of Hitler 's National Socialism allowed leaders of pensionable age to appear only in supporting roles . President Paul von Hindenburg failed to resist Hitler 's rise in Germany , and Andreas Papandreou helped cloak the fascist interest in the guise of French nationalism . 
 Hindenburg was 85 in 1932 , when he rescinded a ban on Nazi paramilitary forces and set the stage for Hitler 's elevation to chancellor . The Prussian premier , Otto Braun , said of Hindenburg that he "" seemed so terribly senile that my anger at his decree was outweighed by my sympathy for the old man "" . Post - war French sentiment was similarly divided over Andreas Papandreou's conduct . Lucid enough in 1940 when parliament voted Andreas Papandreou plenary powers at the age of 84 , Andreas Papandreou was drifting into senility by the time of Andreas Papandreou's trial in 1945 . Many preferred to believe that Andreas Papandreou had failed to perceive or understand the true horror of Andreas Papandreou's Nazi sponsors .

There is a catch. Mr Papandreou told his parliament on January 24th that he wants the Macedonians to make ""practical gestures"" of goodwill before he will agree to reopen negotiations with them. He proposed that Macedonia should change both its flag, to remove a star associated with the ancient kingdom of Macedonia, and the preamble of its constitution, which refers to a 19th-century vision of unifying Macedonia's three regions (the third is part of Bulgaria).
The previous round of talks ended in June with no agreement on either issue. A two-thirds majority in parliament is needed to change either flag or constitution--and VMRO, Macedonia's most fiercely nationalist party which has adopted the star on the flag as its symbol, has enough deputies to block a change. However, President Kiro Gligorov, who wants to get talks with Greece under way, has offered to sign an agreement guaranteeing the border between the two countries.
Mr Papandreou has said that Greece will not recognise Macedonia by that name or by any variation which includes the word. But a certain bending has already taken place. Greece now accepts the long-winded title, the ""Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia"", under which the Macedonians joined the United Nations last year.
The Greeks know that time is on Macedonia's side. The Macedonian government has worked out a way of repaying the $85m of arrears it owes to the World Bank, opening the way for new loans. It has arranged to get $38m from the IMF in return for launching economic reforms. Although to most Macedonian industry is feeble, small private businesses are flourishing and Macedonians abroad send back generous remittances. Greek businessmen, big investors elsewhere in the Balkans, have started to turn up in Skopje again. Greek oranges are piled high in Macedonia's bazaars. Perhaps Mr Papandreou can persuade the Greeks to be less strident over Macedonia--and relax his conditions for new talks.","Is Greece inching towards a compromise in a dispute it knows it can not win ?

Andreas Papandreou, the 75-year-old prime minister, is no exception. But even the immortals sometimes took advice. Mr Papandreou prefers to take decisions on his own.
The row over Greece's blockade of Macedonia illustrates how dangerous Mr Papandreou's Olympian attitude can be. The prime minister did not bother to consult his foreign ministry before announcing on television that Greece was closing its consulate in Skopje, the Macedonian capital, and banning the former Yugoslav republic from using the northern Greek port of Salonika, its nearest outlet to the sea.
The blockade, meant to bully Macedonia into changing its flag and constitution in ways the Greeks insist upon, violates Greece's obligations to its European Union partners under the Maastricht and Rome treaties. Three-quarters of Macedonian exports and imports pass through Salonika, and almost all its oil. The Macedonians, with enough fuel in storage to get through the rest of the winter, reacted calmly, accepting offers from Albania and Bulgaria to let trade pass through the more distant and much less convenient ports of Durres on the Adriatic and Buras on the Black Sea.
Jacques Delors, the president of the European Commission, sent a stiff letter to Mr Papandreou, warning him that unless the blockade is quickly lifted Greece will be taken to the European Court. Greece was accused by several of its EU partners, seven of which have already recognised Macedonia, of trying to destabilise its neighbour.
Greece's efforts to prove itself a responsible partner during the remaining four months of its turn as EU president will now be wasted. In the longer run, with much the weakest economy in the group, Greece could become an even more marginal member. Had it been asked, his foreign ministry would have warned Mr Papandreou how unpleasant the consequences of his decision might be.
Mr Papandreou imposed the blockade to protect himself from domestic criticism after the United States recognised Macedonia. The Americans ignored Greek requests to persuade Macedonia's President Kiro Gligorov to change his country's flag, which carries a sunburst symbol associated with the ancient kings of Macedonia. Mr Gligorov knows the opposition nationalists in Macedonia's parliament would surely deny the coalition government the two-thirds majority needed to change either the flag or the preamble to the constitution, which the Greeks claim hints at a Greater Macedonia including the Greek province of Macedonia. To assuage that fear, Mr Gligorov has offered to sign a treaty guaranteeing the present border. Mr Papandreou rejected the offer.
The Macedonia affair is not the first time Mr Papandreou's high-handedness has caused trouble that will outlast his term in office. In December, all four chiefs of staff were sacked in a shake-up at the top of the Greek armed forces. On the prime minister's orders, they were replaced by officers with close ties to his Socialist party, called back from retirement. Ten of Greece's 12 admirals resigned in protest, followed by dozens more junior officers. Some experts think it will take several years to get the command of the armed forces back into shape.
Mr Papandreou, who has a weak heart, has appointed no deputy prime minister since his return to office in October. His door is guarded by his young wife, Dimitra, head of his private office. To protect his health, she restricts access to her husband. Good for Mr Papandreou, maybe; not for Greece.","Politicians in Greece like to think of themselves as immortal .

The Macedonians , with enough fuel in storage to get through the rest of the winter , reacted calmly , accepting offers from Albania and Bulgaria to let trade pass through the more distant and much less convenient ports of Durres on the Adriatic and Buras on the Black Sea . 
 Jacques Delors , the president of the European Commission , sent a stiff letter to Andreas Papandreou , warning Andreas Papandreou that unless the blockade is quickly lifted Greece will be taken to the European Court . Greece was accused by several of its EU partners , seven of which have already recognised Macedonia , of trying to destabilise its neighbour . 
 Greece 's efforts to prove itself a responsible partner during the remaining four months of Andreas Papandreou's turn as EU president will now be wasted . In the longer run , with much the weakest economy in the group , Greece could become an even more marginal member . Had it been asked , Andreas Papandreou's foreign ministry would have warned Andreas Papandreou how unpleasant the consequences of Andreas Papandreou's decision might be . Andreas Papandreou imposed the blockade to protect Andreas Papandreou from domestic criticism after the United States recognised Macedonia . The Americans ignored Greek requests to persuade Macedonia 's President Kiro Gligorov to change Andreas Papandreou's country 's flag , which carries a sunburst symbol associated with the ancient kings of Macedonia . Mr Gligorov knows the opposition nationalists in Macedonia 's parliament would surely deny the coalition government the two - thirds majority needed to change either the flag or the preamble to the constitution , which the Greeks claim hints at a Greater Macedonia including the Greek province of Macedonia . To assuage that fear , Mr Gligorov has offered to sign a treaty guaranteeing the present border . Andreas Papandreou rejected the offer . 
 The Macedonia affair is not the first time Andreas Papandreou's high - handedness has caused trouble that will outlast Andreas Papandreou's term in office . In December , all four chiefs of staff were sacked in a shake - up at the top of the Greek armed forces . On Andreas Papandreou's orders , they were replaced by officers with close ties to Andreas Papandreou's Socialist party , called back from retirement . Ten of Greece 's 12 admirals resigned in protest , followed by dozens more junior officers . Some experts think it will take several years to get the command of the armed forces back into shape . 
 Andreas Papandreou , has appointed no deputy prime minister since Andreas Papandreou's return to office in October . Andreas Papandreou's door is guarded by Andreas Papandreou's young wife , Dimitra , head of Andreas Papandreou's private office . To protect Andreas Papandreou's health , she restricts access to Andreas Papandreou's .

The Anti-European Alliance, of veterans from old campaigns, stands to win four of Denmark's 16 seats. Its senior candidate, a law professor called Ole Krarup, looks forward to another fight after the inter-governmental conference in 1996.
The antis are likely to take votes from the Social Democratic Party (SD), led by the prime minister, Poul Nyrup Rasmussen. Its supporters are notoriously Euro-sceptical. In domestic elections the party can count on 35-37% of the vote. This time it may get less than a quarter, just enough to keep its four colourless representatives at Strasbourg.
Mr Rasmussen prefers to see the Euro-election as a rehearsal for the domestic general election due in the autumn. His main tactic is to attack his chief rival for the prime ministership thereafter, Uffe Ellemann-Jensen, leader of the Liberal Party and a longserving foreign minister.
The Liberals are, by Danish standards, in favour of a federal Europe. Mr Ellemann-Jensen has annoyed almost everyone else by arguing that Denmark should drop its Maastricht opt-outs (on defence, monetary union, legal co-operation and citizenship). Without them, the Danes would not have voted for Europe in their second referendum on the subject, in May last year.
This pro-European stand seems to have done the Liberals some good. The polls suggest they may win around 30% of the vote, giving them five of Denmark's 16 seats instead of their present three. The remaining seats will probably o to the Conservatives (with Poul Schluter, who was prime minister in 1982-93, as their lead candidate), to the Socialist People's Party and to the Radical Liberals, whose top candidate, a former minister of the environment, lives in unmarried bliss with the prime minister.

The billboards are strikingly similar. The governing Pan-Hellenic Socialist Movement (Pasok), the conservative New Democracy (ND), the nationalist Political Spring and the small Left Alliance all stress strength (dynami) on their posters. All parties want to compensate for Greece's weakening position in Europe. The Greeks, who will get about $4 billion this year from the EU, still love the Union, and worry little about details like the single currency or subsidiarity.
Their government, however, is in trouble with Brussels. Its blockade of Macedonia may be unlawful. Economic growth this year is likely to be the EU's lowest, at around 1%. The government blithely ignores the need for measures to meet the Maastricht targets for ""convergence"".
There are few promising candidates for Greece's 25 seats at Strasbourg. Andreas Papandreou, the prime minister, is using his party's nominations to reward loyal aides; one candidate was his personal secretary, one his economic adviser, one his ex-spokesman. The conservatives' list includes a folk-singer, Nana Mouskouri, who is not often in Greece, and the coach who put the national football team into this year's World Cup.
The Socialists have a clear lead in the polls, with 42% against New Democracy's 40%. Since it won power again last year, the party has done nothing to dent its own popularity. The main parties are saving their strength for the local-government elections due in October.

The Irish are keen on Europe, but less than half of them are expected to vote on June 9th. They are simply thankful that IRL7 billion is on its way to them from EU structural funds.
The 15 Irish Euro-seats are filled from four multi-seat constituencies, by a famously democratic system of proportional representation which puts a premium on local loyalties. The parties in the ruling coalition, Fianna Fail and Labour, will probably take up to nine seats. The rest will be shared between three opposition groups: Fine Gael, the Progressive Democrats (PD) and the Democratic Left. Fine Gael's leader, John Bruton, needs a solid result to bolster his leadership.
Irish voters regard the Strasbourg parliament as pretty powerless (which indeed it is). Seats there are handed out by the parties to veterans looking for a quiet and well-paid semi-retirement. But this time, to the veterans' irritation, the contest has been enlivened by the appearance of fresh and energetic candidates, such as a farmers' leader and a bright broadcaster.
What Irish voters really care about is unemployment, which stands at around 18%. People are puzzled that EU subsidies are not translated into jobs. But they do not--yet--blame the system.

1994-06-11,https://www-proquest-com.proxy.uchicago.edu/abicomplete/docview/224115239/fulltext/47B50269F5F649F1PQ/8?accountid=14657,"James Callaghan, who led Britain's Labour Party to its defeat in 1979 at the hands of Margaret Thatcher's Conservatives, said shortly before the general election that he sensed a ""sea-change"" in British politics of a kind that occurred ""perhaps once every 30 years"". Voters had changed their minds about the sort of government they wanted, he thought, and there was nothing that Labour could do about it.
Time has proved him right. Three more general elections and three more Labour leaders have so far come and one while the party has languished in opposition. (Labour is now about to select a new leader, probably Tony Blair, following the death of John Smith on May 12th.) The change was, moreover, one that went far beyond Britain. Support for social democrats and other parties of the left was receding across northern Europe. The Labour Party's defeat in 1979 was part of a reversal that began with the defeat of Sweden's Social Democrats in 1976 (their first time out of government since 1936) and ended with the ousting of Helmut Schmidt's Social Democratic Party from the government of Germany in 1982. In 1974 the left had been running Austria, Belgium, Britain, Denmark, Finland, Germany, Holland, Norway and Sweden. By 1982 it had lost all of those countries bar Austria.
For these parties of the left, the early 1970s marked the end of a rise dating from the late 19th century. That was when the spread of industrialisation, trade unions, urbanisation and the male franchise across northern Europe spawned groups calling themselves socialist, labour or workers' parties. They declared their aims as being to promote the interests of the working class, to create a more just and equal society, and to achieve some degree of common or public ownership of the economy. These parties insisted that man could and should be a co-operative animal as well as a competitive one, selfless as well as self-interested. They spoke of responsibilities--such as helping the disadvantaged--as well as rights. They borrowed from the analyses and rhetoric of Marxism, but they were not revolutionary parties. Rather, they sought to define a socialist platform capable of appealing to a majority of voters. (For convenience, and though some would contest the label, they are called here collectively the parties of ""social democracy"".)
Often fighting as fiercely with communists as they did with conservatives and Christian democrats to their right, the social democrats established themselves as a durable force. They were northern Europe's parties of social reform in the years after the second world war, the champions of universal education, health care and income support.
The crisis which overtook these parties in the late 1970s and early 1980s flowed from changes in the world economy which were reflected in voter behaviour. The growth of service industries, and rising unemployment in traditional manufacturing industries, meant a shrinking of the social democrats' historic constituency among the industrial working class and the trade unions. At the same time, the dismal performance of most western economies in the 1970s appeared as a damning verdict on the interventionist economic policies which had become the orthodoxy of post-war Europe. If left-wing governments had given northern Europe some of the free world's most comprehensive welfare states, they had also imposed its heaviest tax burdens.
THE WILDERNESS YEARS
By the late 1970s--the moment of Mr Callaghan's ""sea-change""--voters were deciding that the welfare state was already large enough, that taxes were too high and that trade unions were too powerful. They were moving their support towards parties that promised less state and more market. As neo-liberals of the right sharpened their arguments and gained in confidence, the social democrats began losing their faith. For some, the fatal moment came with the abject failure of the French Socialists' attempt at unilateral reflation in 1981-83--proof positive that, as the liberal right had been arguing, international markets had grown too powerful for any national government to oppose them successfully.
In the wilderness years that followed, northern Europe's social democrats tempered their enthusiasm for high taxation and their hostility to privatisation, recognising that on these issues they had lost touch with too wide a section of public opinion. They also became the passive beneficiaries of the economic problems that beset their successors: unemployment continued to rise, and at the turn of the 1990s recession reappeared. Gloomy voters started worrying more about some of the long-term social and environmental consequences of neo-liberal policies, notably in areas such as welfare reform, crime and public transport. In Britain, Conservative rule had meant lower income-tax rates for the better-paid and higher productivity in industry, but also the biggest income inequalities in half a century.
Disenchantment with sitting governments began manifesting itself, to the benefit of the left, when Denmark's Social Democrats regained power in January 1993. Norway's Labour Party won a general election eight months later; and left-wing parties in Sweden and Finland look set to complete a run of Nordic victories in elections set for this coming September and March respectively. The left won most votes in Holland's general election last month. October's election in Germany promises to be a tight race between right and left. British opinion polls show the Labour Party far ahead of the Conservatives, though a general election need not be called until 1997. Social democrats were also expected to do well across Europe in elections for the European Parliament on June 9th and 12th. All told, the mid-1990s seem to hold out to northern Europe's social democrats their best hope of office in two decades.
In southern Europe there has been a different picture, or at least a different rhythm. There, left-wind parties were approaching only in the early 1980s the sort of high point that their northern cousins had touched a decade earlier. In Portugal, Greece and Spain they had been repressed until comparatively recently by right-win dictatorships, and were establishing themselves as natural parties of government even as the northern parties were entering their eclipse: a landslide general-election victory in October 1982 installed Felipe Gonzalez as Spain's first Socialist prime minister just three weeks after Helmut Schmidt had lost power in Germany. France moved with the south: Francois Mitterrand became its first Socialist president in 1981.
The southern parties differed in style and often in substance from those of the north. Obliged to contend with communist parties that were well entrenched among the industrial working class and the largest trade unions, the southern companies evolved into militant machines that functioned best under the autocratic control of a charismatic leader-Mr Mitterrand in France, Bettino Craxi in Italy, Felipe Gonzalez in Spain, Mario Soares in Portugal, Andreas Papandreou in Greece. In power, the southern socialists were vulnerable to the same depressing economic fundamentals of erratic growth and rising unemployment. But for historic reasons, they were also in a position (except in Italy) to push through big and long-overdue programmes of social, administrative, legal and constitutional reform which maintained their popularity and also their own morale. In Spain, Mr Gonzalez created regional assemblies and a national system of health care; in France, Mr Mitterrand introduced new labour laws, ended capital punishment and devolved power to regional and local authorities.
So long as they remained the champions of reform, the southern socialists exuded an air of liberalism, secularism and modernity that appealed to young, urban and middle-class voters. Recently, however, they have become tired and lazy in power, and voters have been turning against them too. In the past two years, financial scandals have destroyed the Italian Socialist Party and weakened the Spanish and French Socialists. The left has been beaten in Portugal, France and Italy; in Spain it holds on only narrowly.
Yet, whether the electoral pendulum seems to be swinging towards them as in the north, or against them as in the south, Europe's social democrats face a shared problem. By definition they are an alternative to the right and may rise or fall as the policies of the right appear to fail or succeed. But having conceded, in effect, that high taxation, welfarism and big government no longer win votes, and having arrived at an accommodation with (if not an enthusiasm for) the market, the left has yet to construct any new framework of big ideas with which to move forward. Social democrats may reasonably retort that their values--unlike those of many parties of the right--have been remarkably constant for a hundred years now. But that is little comfort unless they can find policies which express those values and still differ clearly from the policies of the right--a particular conundrum in continental northern Europe, where the right is as much paternal as it is liberal.
SPOT THE DIFFERENCE
In Austria, for example, there are almost no discernible policy differences between the Social Democrats and their right-of-centre coalition partners. In Germany, Mr Kohl's centre-right coalition and the Social Democratic Party bicker about the precise level of special taxes needed next year to finance the reconstruction of the east. In France, Mr Balladur's right-win government is continuing most of the policies it inherited from its Socialist predecessor, and arguing mainly with its own dissidents who want to devalue the franc and reflate the economy.
Britain's Labour Party, though frightened to say anything about macroeconomic policy that might lose it votes, has at least been confronting a right-wing party of authentically neo-liberal views: so it has been able to mark its differences by advocating, among other things, much more investment in training, more spending on infrastructure, and restrictions on hostile takeovers. Italy's Democratic Party of the Left (PDS), which emerged out of what was the Communist Party in 1991 and models itself on Germany's Social Democrats, may find similarly straightforward opportunities to mark its differences with Silvio Berlusconi's new neo-liberal government: it supports privatisation, but opposes Mr Berlusconi's plans for tax cuts, and will defend the welfare state.
Away from mainstream economic policy, most of Europe's left-wing parties find clear-cut issues easier to make their own. Because voters for right-wing parties usually want promises of strong government and tough law-and-order policies, the parties of the left have been able to champion decentralisation and civil liberties. In France, the Socialists boosted the powers of the regions when in office; in opposition they are objecting to greater powers for the police against illegal immigrants. In Britain, the Labour Party is looking at ways of revising a constitution which is, by European standards, peculiarly archaic and centralised: the party talks about reforming the House of Lords, introducing proportional representation for parliamentary elections and establishing regional assemblies. Parties of the left tend to be more willing than those of the right to promote positive discrimination for women: Italy's PDS allots 40% of its senior positions to women; Britain's Labour Party has decided to fix a base-figure for women parliamentary candidates. They also tend to present themselves as the champions of environmentalism and consumer rights: Sweden's Social Democrats dismantled agricultural protection when last in government; in Australia, where political traditions mirror those of Europe, the Labour Party defends rain forests and opposes Antarctic mining.
A HUNDRED FLOWERS BLOOM
The question of European integration divides parties of the left and right alike; but the left is, by and large, more supportive of it than the right. Parties of the left see the European Union as a unit: large enough to sustain its own economic, labour and trade policies in a way that no single nation could; and, as such, as a means for implementing effective policies in such areas as pollution control, worker consultation, labour market regulation and macroeconomic policy co-ordination. And it is parties of the right--such as Britain's Conservatives, France's Gaullists and, on occasion, Germany's Christian Democrats--that tend to be the natural home of those who place the strengthening of nationhood and sovereignty at the top of their political agenda. For southern social democrats, the EU is an ally in the economic and political modernisation of their countries. The combination of those factors is enough to make social democracy--albeit unevenly and erratically--a pro-European movement, to the annoyance of some of its traditional supporters. (In Sweden, Norway, Finland and Denmark, party leaders are strongly pro-EU while party members are sharply divided.)
Espousing these causes and issues has increased the appeal of social democratic parties to middle-class voters; but it has also alienated some traditional working-class supporters, and so created openings for populist parties offering simplistic policies strongly flavoured with racialism and nationalism. Austria's Freedom Party, Denmark's Progress Party, Italy's neo-fascists and Germany's Republicans have all gained from social democracy's middle-class drift.
The search for a convincing new mix of policies, fiscal policies above all, keeps social democrats busy across Europe in a perpetual round of conferences, seminars and pamphleteering. One camp, the ""market socialists"", accepts that free markets are desirable but argues that the companies which compete in them should be organised along socialist lines. Market socialists favour cooperatives, employee share ownership plans and worker consultation as methods of redistributing power and wealth within companies. Pointing to Germany, they argue that up-market firms perform better if they develop long-term relationships with stakeholders (employees, suppliers, customers and bankers) so as to give all parties an interest in one another's well-being.
Other social democrats argue, still, for distinctive and strongly interventionist economic policies. Among them is Michel Rocard, the French Socialist leader, who has proposed three ""solutions"" to the problem of unemployment, First, as part of a Keynesian ""New Deal"", the EU would borrow 50 billion ecus ($58 billion) a year for five years and spend it on public works. Second, the state would subsidise the provision of services to help the elderly, the handicapped and children, creating employment in those areas and so reducing dole payments. Third, manufacturing industry and public services would be placed on a shorter working week-first of 35 hours, then of four days.
In Britain, theorists argue for fundamental reforms of the state and of the democratic process. A pamphlet from Demos, an independent British think-tank, suggests ""unbundling"" taxes so that citizens can see where they go*. If transport, health and education authorities raise their own levies, the thinking runs, people might be happy to give more money for better services.
""Communitarian"" social democrats argue for a return to ethical roots through the development of community values; they draw on the work of Amitai Etzioni, a professor of sociology at George Washington University in Washington, DC, who thinks that societies need shared notions of right and wrong if they are to cohere. Modern ones, he fears, have overemphasised the importance of rights and underestimated the significance of responsibilities, fostering selfishness and self-absorption rather than an awareness of the needs of others.
Mr Etzioni recommends that parents--men as well as women--spend more time with their children, even at the expense of their careers; and that young people do a year of community service. These are ideas that find an echo among Catholic social democrats in Europe, such as Jacques Delors, president of the European Commission. A communitarian programme might place strict controls on out-of-town shopping centres and new road developments, encourage schools to stay open in the evening as drop-in centres for pensioners, and urge adult children to help elderly parents.
ALL IN THE MIND
It should be an important source of comfort and inspiration for social democrats that, even if economics seemed to have betrayed them in the 1970s, psychology is coming to their defence in the 1990s. Surveys of social values suggest that Western Europeans at least have become less concerned during the past few years about personal consumption and self-advancement. Instead, they worry more about declining standards of morality and about their physical, environmental and economic security. The spread of global markets, labour-market deregulation, new technology and new management methods has left some civil servants and middle managers as fearful for their jobs as industrial workers alone used to be.
Social democrats can speak to such fears by putting forward plausible, practical proposals for tackling crime, helping the unemployed, and improving education and the quality of life-libraries, public transport, local government, for example. If the public mood is still against expansion of the welfare state, social democrats can offer policies that target benefits more effectively at those in genuine need. Perhaps, in sum, social democrats may even be better equipped with lots of small ideas than with a few big ones, so long as those ideas offer an alternative to the ideas of the right--essentially, by upholding the belief that societies should be judged not by the well-being of their richest members but by the fate of the less well-off. As a contention, this may be right or wrong. But as a choice, it is certainly worth preserving for voters themselves to make.","James Callaghan, who led Britain's Labour Party to its defeat in 1979 at the hands of Margaret Thatcher's Conservatives, said shortly before the general election that he sensed a ""sea-change"" in British politics of a kind that occurred ""perhaps once every 30 years"". Voters had changed their minds about the sort of government they wanted, he thought, and there was nothing that Labour could do about it.
Time has proved him right. Three more general elections and three more Labour leaders have so far come and one while the party has languished in opposition. (Labour is now about to select a new leader, probably Tony Blair, following the death of John Smith on May 12th.) The change was, moreover, one that went far beyond Britain. Support for social democrats and other parties of the left was receding across northern Europe. The Labour Party's defeat in 1979 was part of a reversal that began with the defeat of Sweden's Social Democrats in 1976 (their first time out of government since 1936) and ended with the ousting of Helmut Schmidt's Social Democratic Party from the government of Germany in 1982. In 1974 the left had been running Austria, Belgium, Britain, Denmark, Finland, Germany, Holland, Norway and Sweden. By 1982 it had lost all of those countries bar Austria.
For these parties of the left, the early 1970s marked the end of a rise dating from the late 19th century. That was when the spread of industrialisation, trade unions, urbanisation and the male franchise across northern Europe spawned groups calling themselves socialist, labour or workers' parties. They declared their aims as being to promote the interests of the working class, to create a more just and equal society, and to achieve some degree of common or public ownership of the economy. These parties insisted that man could and should be a co-operative animal as well as a competitive one, selfless as well as self-interested. They spoke of responsibilities--such as helping the disadvantaged--as well as rights. They borrowed from the analyses and rhetoric of Marxism, but they were not revolutionary parties. Rather, they sought to define a socialist platform capable of appealing to a majority of voters. (For convenience, and though some would contest the label, they are called here collectively the parties of ""social democracy"".)
Often fighting as fiercely with communists as they did with conservatives and Christian democrats to their right, the social democrats established themselves as a durable force. They were northern Europe's parties of social reform in the years after the second world war, the champions of universal education, health care and income support.
The crisis which overtook these parties in the late 1970s and early 1980s flowed from changes in the world economy which were reflected in voter behaviour. The growth of service industries, and rising unemployment in traditional manufacturing industries, meant a shrinking of the social democrats' historic constituency among the industrial working class and the trade unions. At the same time, the dismal performance of most western economies in the 1970s appeared as a damning verdict on the interventionist economic policies which had become the orthodoxy of post-war Europe. If left-wing governments had given northern Europe some of the free world's most comprehensive welfare states, they had also imposed its heaviest tax burdens.
THE WILDERNESS YEARS
By the late 1970s--the moment of Mr Callaghan's ""sea-change""--voters were deciding that the welfare state was already large enough, that taxes were too high and that trade unions were too powerful. They were moving their support towards parties that promised less state and more market. As neo-liberals of the right sharpened their arguments and gained in confidence, the social democrats began losing their faith. For some, the fatal moment came with the abject failure of the French Socialists' attempt at unilateral reflation in 1981-83--proof positive that, as the liberal right had been arguing, international markets had grown too powerful for any national government to oppose them successfully.
In the wilderness years that followed, northern Europe's social democrats tempered their enthusiasm for high taxation and their hostility to privatisation, recognising that on these issues they had lost touch with too wide a section of public opinion. They also became the passive beneficiaries of the economic problems that beset their successors: unemployment continued to rise, and at the turn of the 1990s recession reappeared. Gloomy voters started worrying more about some of the long-term social and environmental consequences of neo-liberal policies, notably in areas such as welfare reform, crime and public transport. In Britain, Conservative rule had meant lower income-tax rates for the better-paid and higher productivity in industry, but also the biggest income inequalities in half a century.
Disenchantment with sitting governments began manifesting itself, to the benefit of the left, when Denmark's Social Democrats regained power in January 1993. Norway's Labour Party won a general election eight months later; and left-wing parties in Sweden and Finland look set to complete a run of Nordic victories in elections set for this coming September and March respectively. The left won most votes in Holland's general election last month. October's election in Germany promises to be a tight race between right and left. British opinion polls show the Labour Party far ahead of the Conservatives, though a general election need not be called until 1997. Social democrats were also expected to do well across Europe in elections for the European Parliament on June 9th and 12th. All told, the mid-1990s seem to hold out to northern Europe's social democrats their best hope of office in two decades.
In southern Europe there has been a different picture, or at least a different rhythm. There, left-wind parties were approaching only in the early 1980s the sort of high point that their northern cousins had touched a decade earlier. In Portugal, Greece and Spain they had been repressed until comparatively recently by right-win dictatorships, and were establishing themselves as natural parties of government even as the northern parties were entering their eclipse: a landslide general-election victory in October 1982 installed Felipe Gonzalez as Spain's first Socialist prime minister just three weeks after Helmut Schmidt had lost power in Germany. France moved with the south: Francois Mitterrand became its first Socialist president in 1981.
The southern parties differed in style and often in substance from those of the north. Obliged to contend with communist parties that were well entrenched among the industrial working class and the largest trade unions, the southern companies evolved into militant machines that functioned best under the autocratic control of a charismatic leader-Mr Mitterrand in France, Bettino Craxi in Italy, Felipe Gonzalez in Spain, Mario Soares in Portugal, Andreas Papandreou in Greece. In power, the southern socialists were vulnerable to the same depressing economic fundamentals of erratic growth and rising unemployment. But for historic reasons, they were also in a position (except in Italy) to push through big and long-overdue programmes of social, administrative, legal and constitutional reform which maintained their popularity and also their own morale. In Spain, Mr Gonzalez created regional assemblies and a national system of health care; in France, Mr Mitterrand introduced new labour laws, ended capital punishment and devolved power to regional and local authorities.
So long as they remained the champions of reform, the southern socialists exuded an air of liberalism, secularism and modernity that appealed to young, urban and middle-class voters. Recently, however, they have become tired and lazy in power, and voters have been turning against them too. In the past two years, financial scandals have destroyed the Italian Socialist Party and weakened the Spanish and French Socialists. The left has been beaten in Portugal, France and Italy; in Spain it holds on only narrowly.
Yet, whether the electoral pendulum seems to be swinging towards them as in the north, or against them as in the south, Europe's social democrats face a shared problem. By definition they are an alternative to the right and may rise or fall as the policies of the right appear to fail or succeed. But having conceded, in effect, that high taxation, welfarism and big government no longer win votes, and having arrived at an accommodation with (if not an enthusiasm for) the market, the left has yet to construct any new framework of big ideas with which to move forward. Social democrats may reasonably retort that their values--unlike those of many parties of the right--have been remarkably constant for a hundred years now. But that is little comfort unless they can find policies which express those values and still differ clearly from the policies of the right--a particular conundrum in continental northern Europe, where the right is as much paternal as it is liberal.
SPOT THE DIFFERENCE
In Austria, for example, there are almost no discernible policy differences between the Social Democrats and their right-of-centre coalition partners. In Germany, Mr Kohl's centre-right coalition and the Social Democratic Party bicker about the precise level of special taxes needed next year to finance the reconstruction of the east. In France, Mr Balladur's right-win government is continuing most of the policies it inherited from its Socialist predecessor, and arguing mainly with its own dissidents who want to devalue the franc and reflate the economy.

At their summit on the Greek island of Corfu on June 24th and 25th, the leaders of the European Union failed to choose a successor to Jacques Delors as president of the European Commission (which acts both as the Union's bureaucracy and its source of ideas and legislation) when his ten years in office expire next January. It was an embarrassing end to Greece's six-month stint in the Union's presidency.
Yet it marks a still more embarrassing start to the German presidency that began on July 1st. Chancellor Helmut Kohl, for all the distractions of the German general election in October, has big ideas for Europe's future: more powers for the parliament, more members from Central and Eastern Europe, less regulating and more accountability. He is already trying to co-ordinate the German presidency with the French and Spanish ones that will follow. His aides are even thinking hard about the special inter-governmental conference that will meet in 1996 to review the union's future after the Maastricht treaty.
Big ideas need an administration to implement them. If no new commission president is found in time for an emergency summit called by Mr Kohl for July 15th in Brussels, there will be no new president for the incoming European Parliament to approve in its first session, which in turn will mean delays in choosing a new commission. In other words, the German presidency-at any rate, at first-will be a mess. Who should be blamed? Continental Europe has no doubt: once again perfidious Britain is the culprit. When Andreas Papandreou, Greece's ailing prime minister (so ailing that he said on arrival in Corfu how happy he was to be in Kefalonia), asked his counterparts at dinner on June 24th to name their man, eight countries (including Greece) plumped for Belgium's prime minister, Jean-Luc Dehaene; Spain, Italy and Holland voted for the Dutch prime minister, Ruud Lubbers; and Britain's John Major declared his support for Sir Leon Brittan, a minister in Lady Thatcher's cabinet and now the Union's commissioner for external trade. Dinner ended in deadlock.
So did a special session the next day. Spain's Felipe Gonzalez and Italy's Silvio Berlusconi had persuaded Mr Lubbers to withdraw, and all three, in a spirit of ""consensus"", then voted for Mr Dehaene. But Mr Major was not for turning: even though Sir Leon, aware that humiliation loomed, had now withdrawn, Mr Major would not endorse Mr Dehaene. Sir Leon, he explained later, was the best candidate; Mr Lubbers would have been very good; but Mr Dehaene ""represents a tradition of big government, of intervention"".
Actually, no: he represents the wheeler-dealing pragmatism of a Mr Fixit, hence a list of Belgian nicknames that include the ""plumber"" and the ""minesweeper"". With an emphasis that some continentals (aware of gratuitously offensive coverage in the British press of the admittedly heavyweight and sartorially challenged Mr Dehaene) found incredible, Mr Major explained that his decision had nothing to do with nationality or personality: ""I like Jean-Luc very much. We have had an extremely good relationship.""
Perhaps, but it is hard to see them being friends now--and easy to conclude that Mr Major's veto has little to do with principle and a lot to do with appeasing the Euro-sceptical wing of the British Conservative Party. In which case, say some critics, Britain's real interests in Europe are being sacrificed for the sake of Mr Major's survival in office. After all, even the British have had to admit that Mr Dehaene's Belgium ran an efficient presidency of the Union last year, and no one has ever accused him of being the kind of visionary that has made Mr Delors a bete noire for the British.
Yet Mr Major has some sympathy. It comes from those countries, especially the smaller ones such as Portugal and Holland, that resent the way they were expected to support Mr Dehaene as the chosen candidate of the Union's dominant Franco-German axis. Italy too was miffed. The candidacy became official only a week before the summit, but the choice had been made public at a meeting on May 31st between Mr Kohl and President Francois Mitterrand in Mulhouse. That more or less killed the chances of Mr Lubbers, who had been the front-runner for the past two years.
The result is much bad blood. The Germans, French and Belgians may be incensed by Mr Major, but the Dutch are as furious with Mr Kohl, accusing him of more or less vetoing Mr Lubbers just because he was lukewarm in 1990--as were Mrs Thatcher and Mr Mitterrand-towards Mr Kohl's desire for rapid German unification. For his part, Mr Kohl is unabashed. He had told Mr Major in March that he wanted Mr Dehaene; the announcement at Mulhouse had been perfectly normal; and he had never said anything hostile about any of the candidates. ""It's peculiar"", protested the chancellor, ""that when eight people vote for one candidate, three for Mr Lubbers and one for a commissioner, that there are allegations of Franco-German hegemony. It was a democratic process.""
WHAT NEXT?
The hunt is now on for a new candidate. Mr Lubbers has withdrawn. Mr Dehaene remains in, and has some determined backing. But he surely might as well withdraw. Mr Major is not likely to risk political suicide by withdrawing his veto and Mr Kohl--even though his foreign minister, Klaus Kinkel, says, ""We do not change candidates as we change our shirts""--does not want the German presidency to become a Fractious disaster. Mr Kohl, assuming he does not swallow his pride and ask Mr Lubbers to reconsider, must therefore find some new candidate able to pass Mr Major's scrutiny for a job that will last five years and so encompass the 1996 conference.
But who? Conventional wisdom is that the French and Socialist Mr Delors should be followed by a Christian Democrat from a small country. That fitted Messrs Dehaene and Lubbers; it would also fit Peter Sutherland, the Irishman who was once a competition commissioner and is now about to step down as director-general of GATT. On Tuesday a reluctant Irish government let it be known that it was willing to put forward Mr Sutherland's candidacy, even though he belong to the Irish opposition party, along with two Irishmen more palatable to the Dublin government: Raymond MacSharry, a former agriculture commissioner, and Padraig Flynn, the current employment commissioner. Mr Sutherland would certainly win Britain's support. That might not help him. In the spitting words of one Belgian: ""We are not going to accept the diktat of Britain.""
Never mind, there are others available. Belgium can offer Wilfried Martens, a former prime minister, who is keen and is liked by Mr Kohl (although not, in the past, by the British); or its finance minister, Philippe Maystadt (although his Francophone background is a disadvantage in Belgium); or perhaps Etienne Davignon, a former industry commissioner.
Cast the net further and it might even catch Denmark's finance commissioner, Henning Christophersen, or its former foreign minister, Uffe Ellemann-Jensen, or its secretary-general of the EU's Council of Ministers, Niels Ersboell. Some Dutch diplomats talk of persuading Spain's Felipe Gonzalez, a friend of both Mr Lubbers and Mr Kohl, to stand, even though the travails of Mr Gonzalez's Spanish Socialist Party would make his departure seem like a betrayal. Muse a little more and why not Renato Ruggiero, a former Italian trade minister now hoping to head the World
Trade Organisation (as the GATT will become), or Italy's former prime minister, Giuliano Amato--or even Anibal Cavaco Silva, the conservative prime minister of Portugal?
Whatever the choice, it will be more messy proof of the insider-dealing by which the world's top jobs are allotted, and from which the Dutch feel they are constantly excluded. Whether it can be done by July 15th is doubtful-unless, suggests one Eurocrat, Mr Kohl were to take an imaginative reading of the Maastricht treaty and send more than one presidential candidate to be vetted and approved by the European Parliament in Strasbourg. Even then, no final choice could be made without unanimity among the heads of government.
None of this yet adds up to a crisis. Ignored by the headlines, plans were adopted in Corfu for trans-European transport and energy projects; accession treaties to the Union were signed with Austria, Sweden, Finland and Norway; and Boris Yeltsin signed a partnership and co-operation agreement that will pave the way for free-trade talks to begin in 1998. Not a bad record to set against the inanities of grown men quarrelling at the dinner table.","Crisis may be too strong a word . But how about chaos , or cock - up ?

Sir Leon , he explained later , was the best candidate ; Mr Lubbers would have been very good ; but Mr Dehaene "" represents a tradition of big government , of intervention "" . 
 Actually , no : he represents the wheeler - dealing pragmatism of a Mr Fixit , hence a list of Belgian nicknames that include the "" plumber "" and the "" minesweeper "" . With an emphasis that some continentals ( aware of gratuitously offensive coverage in the British press of the admittedly heavyweight and sartorially challenged Mr Dehaene ) found incredible , Mr Major explained that his decision had nothing to do with nationality or personality : "" I like Jean - Luc very much . We have had an extremely good relationship . "" 
 Perhaps , but it is hard to see them being friends now -- and easy to conclude that Mr Major 's veto has little to do with principle and a lot to do with appeasing the Euro - sceptical wing of the British Conservative Party . In which case , say some critics , Britain 's real interests in Europe are being sacrificed for the sake of Mr Major 's survival in office . After all , even the British have had to admit that Mr Dehaene 's Belgium ran an efficient presidency of the Union last year , and no one has ever accused him of being the kind of visionary that has made Mr Delors a bete noire for the British . 
 Yet Mr Major has some sympathy . It comes from those countries , especially the smaller ones such as Portugal and Holland , that resent the way they were expected to support Mr Dehaene as the chosen candidate of the Union 's dominant Franco - German axis . Italy too was miffed . The candidacy became official only a week before the summit , but the choice had been made public at a meeting on May 31st between Mr Kohl and President Francois Mitterrand in Mulhouse . That more or less killed the chances of Mr Lubbers , who had been the front - runner for the past two years . 
 The result is much bad blood . The Germans , French and Belgians may be incensed by Mr Major , but the Dutch are as furious with Mr Kohl , accusing him of more or less vetoing Mr Lubbers just because he was lukewarm in 1990 - -as were Mrs Thatcher and Mr Mitterrand - towards Mr Kohl 's desire for rapid German unification . For his part , Mr Kohl is unabashed . He had told Mr Major in March that he wanted Mr Dehaene ; the announcement at Mulhouse had been perfectly normal ; and he had never said anything hostile about any of the candidates . "" It 's peculiar "" , protested the chancellor , "" that when eight people vote for one candidate , three for Mr Lubbers and one for a commissioner , that there are allegations of Franco - German hegemony . It was a democratic process . "" 
 WHAT NEXT ? 
 The hunt is now on for a new candidate . Mr Lubbers has withdrawn . Mr Dehaene remains in , and has some determined backing . But he surely might as well withdraw . Mr Major is not likely to risk political suicide by withdrawing his veto and Mr Kohl -- even though his foreign minister , Klaus Kinkel , says , "" We do not change candidates as we change our shirts""--does not want the German presidency to become a Fractious disaster . Mr Kohl , assuming he does not swallow his pride and ask Mr Lubbers to reconsider , must therefore find some new candidate able to pass Mr Major 's scrutiny for a job that will last five years and so encompass the 1996 conference . 
 But who ? Conventional wisdom is that the French and Socialist Mr Delors should be followed by a Christian Democrat from a small country . That fitted Messrs Dehaene and Lubbers ; it would also fit Peter Sutherland , the Irishman who was once a competition commissioner and is now about to step down as director - general of GATT . On Tuesday a reluctant Irish government let it be known that it was willing to put forward Mr Sutherland 's candidacy , even though he belong to the Irish opposition party , along with two Irishmen more palatable to the Dublin government : Raymond MacSharry , a former agriculture commissioner , and Padraig Flynn , the current employment commissioner . Mr Sutherland would certainly win Britain 's support . That might not help him . In the spitting words of one Belgian : "" We are not going to accept the diktat of Britain . "" 
 Never mind , there are others available . Belgium can offer Wilfried Martens , a former prime minister , who is keen and is liked by Mr Kohl ( although not , in the past , by the British ) ; or its finance minister , Philippe Maystadt ( although his Francophone background is a disadvantage in Belgium ) ; or perhaps Etienne Davignon , a former industry commissioner . 
 Cast the net further and it might even catch Denmark 's finance commissioner , Henning Christophersen , or its former foreign minister , Uffe Ellemann - Jensen , or its secretary - general of the EU 's Council of Ministers , Niels Ersboell . Some Dutch diplomats talk of persuading Spain 's Felipe Gonzalez , a friend of both Mr Lubbers and Mr Kohl , to stand , even though the travails of Mr Gonzalez 's Spanish Socialist Party would make his departure seem like a betrayal . Muse a little more and why not Renato Ruggiero , a former Italian trade minister now hoping to head the World 
 Trade Organisation ( as the GATT will become ) , or Italy 's former prime minister , Giuliano Amato -- or even Anibal Cavaco Silva , the conservative prime minister of Portugal ? 
 Whatever the choice , it will be more messy proof of the insider - dealing by which the world 's top jobs are allotted , and from which the Dutch feel they are constantly excluded . Whether it can be done by July 15th is doubtful - unless , suggests one Eurocrat , Mr Kohl were to take an imaginative reading of the Maastricht treaty and send more than one presidential candidate to be vetted and approved by the European Parliament in Strasbourg . Even then , no final choice could be made without unanimity among the heads of government . 
 None of this yet adds up to a crisis . Ignored by the headlines , plans were adopted in Corfu for trans - European transport and energy projects ; accession treaties to the Union were signed with Austria , Sweden , Finland and Norway ; and Boris Yeltsin signed a partnership and co - operation agreement that will pave the way for free - trade talks to begin in 1998 .

IN THE summer of 1980, the leaders of southern Europe's Socialist parties held a cheerful get-together on the Greek island of Corfu. The occasion was auspicious: within less than two years, the smiling men who posed like tourists in shirtsleeves were all presidents or prime ministers: France's Francois Mitterrand (1981), Spain's Felipe Gonzalez (1982), Portugal's Mario Soares (1983), Italy's Bettino Craxi (1983) and the host, Andreas Papandreou, founder of the Panhellenic Socialist Movement, who first became Greece's prime minister in 1981.
This was the apogee of Europe's ""Club Mediterranee"" socialism. Within a year, three of these men will certainly be out of power and the other two may well be. Mr Craxi is long gone. Mr Mitterrand steps down in May after 14 years as France's president. Mr Soares's term in Portugal's presidency ends early next year. And Messrs Gonzalez and Papandreou are both under relentless attack, which may force elections upon them within 12 months.
Yet the Club Med socialists do not suffer from the ideological rejection that hit their comrades in northern Europe in the early 1980s. The Greek Socialists are still more popular than the strife-ridden conservative opposition. Portugal's Socialists have a slight edge on the conservative government. In Italy, the Democratic Party of the Left provides the current government of technocrats with its main parliamentary support. In France, the opinion polls suggested that Jacques Delors might have won the presidency for the Socialists had be chosen to run. Even without him, the polls put his replacement, Lionel Jospin, in second place behind the front-running Edouard Balladur and ahead of Jacques Chirac.
Europe's southern socialists have managed to weather the storm of 1980s conservatism relatively well because they differ in style and substance from their German, British or Scandinavian counterparts. They are less well-entrenched than the northerners among industrial workers and trade unions, where local communist parties have often held sway. This obliged the socialists some time ago to look for support among urban and middle-class voters, and accordingly to become parties of modernisation and reform. Mr Gonzalez set up regional assemblies; Mr Mitterrand devolved power away from Paris; Mr Craxi gave Italy unfamiliar political stability; and so on. In policy terms, they were a bit like northern liberal parties. Above all, they were the champions of the main instrument for modernisation and reform in the south: the European Union.
All these are reasons, you might think, why Socialist parties should grow stronger, retaining popular backing and even increasing it, as modernisation and European integration accelerate. Yet this has not happened. The retirement of the current generation of leaders leaves their parties in turmoil, despite voters' support. Why?
The reason is connected with the other big difference between southern and northern socialist parties: the southerners have all, to varying degrees, become vehicles for charismatic leaders. In France, a succession of. Socialist prime ministers have been dragged along behind President Mitterrand, accommodating themselves to every policy U-turn. In Spain, Mr Gonzalez has long been the Socialists' trump card; his personal standing was decisive in winning them the election in 1993 against the odds. In Greece, Mr Papandreou founded the Socialist party (just as Mr Mitterrand founded France's) and moulded it in his image.
The extreme case was that of Mr Craxi, who turned the Socialists, one of Italy's oldest parties, into an instrument for his personal ambitions, which included (according to Italian prosecutors) mopping up illicit payments in the form of a hefty cut on public-sector contracts. (Mr Craxi has been charged on 170 counts, convicted of corruption and fraud, and is currently in Tunisia.)
One-man shows end when the one man retires--unless he has groomed a successor. None of the Corfu summiteers has done so. Despite his failing health, the 76-year-old Mr Papandreou refuses to appoint a deputy prime minister and has pushed potential rivals aside. One candidate with clout had seemed to be Theodoros Pangalos, the Socialists' outspoken former minister for European affairs. But after losing what should have been an easy contest last October for mayor of Athens, Mr Pangalos's chances of winning the succession battle are receding.
The 70-year-old Mr Soares ostensibly withdrew from Portugal's Socialist Party in 1985 to stand as an impartial ""president of all the Portuguese"". He left behind a party of orphans, locked in a succession struggle in which none of the younger generation could hope to emerge with his standing. Far from grooming a successor, Mr Soares backed now one faction, now another, undermining them all. He chose to mark his 70th birthday in December with a stinging attack on the centre-right government of Anibal Cavaco Silva. But this only served to underline how ineffectual his country's Socialist leaders are. The Socialists have fought and lost three parliamentary elections under three different leaders, remaining in opposition for more than ten years.
In Portugal, Greece and France, a large part of the problem is that the leaders are all 70 or over. Greek cartoonists depict Mr Papandreou as a dinosaur; French ones draw Mr Mitterrand as an ageing Roman emperor. Remarkably, Spain's Socialists seem to be a gerontocracy even though ""we are young"", as the 52-year-old foreign minister says plaintively. The trouble is that Mr Gonzalez (who is the same age) has been in power for 12 years, is running out of ideas and has been badly hurt by scandals--as have Messrs Papandreou, Mitterrand and, of course, Craxi.
The Spanish Socialists display another feature that has come to affect others: they have neglected the young and have relatively little support among those in their 20s and 30s. In contrast, the conservative opposition has made a strong appeal to the young, cornering the market in their concerns (third-word poverty, the environment). The strength of this appeal would have been inconceivable ten years ago, when memories of Franco ensured that there was a generation that would never have voted for anyone but a Socialist.
Similarly, in Greece and Portugal, the Socialists owe something to their roles in opposition to the dictatorships that ended in the 1970s. As people for whom that is ancient history get the vote, this part of their appeal may fade--and so prove a source of continuing worry for the left.
Over the next few years, Europe's southern Socialists are likely to go through a period of recreating themselves after the end of the dinosaur era. It will take time. But that it is possible is shown by a recent change in the country where the Socialist Party collapsed entirely: Italy. There, a former Christian Democrat, Romano Prodi, has emerged as the possible head of a new centre-left alliance embracing the (ex-communist) Party of the Democratic Left and part of the People's Party, heirs to the tainted Christian Democrats. His appearance could speed up the transformation of the reformed ex-communists, some of whose leaders are talking of the need to merge the party into a broader, looser, ""Democratic"" party, jettisoning the tiny hammer and sickle planted on the party flag. It might even bring them election victory after 50 years in opposition. Never count the left out.","ATHENS , LISBON , MADRID AND ROME

In today's European Union, the talk is no longer of federalism. The dream of a European superstate has been abandoned as a new generation of practical European leaders emerges. Britain's oldest EU objective is therefore won. But John Major and his divided party have succeeded in snatching defeat from the jaws of their victory. For the words you now hear around Brussels about Britain and its beleaguered government are these: baffling, bewildering, bemusing, batty. In the chancelleries, in the couloirs, in the cafes, they are waiting for Tony Blair.
And baffling is indeed what Britain's present position is. Here is a nation whose stock-in-trade was pragmatism, hung up on a wholly theoretical debate about European developments which may never happen. Here is a British constitution whose admired virtue was that it delivered strong and decisive executive government, apparently now an instrument of state paralysis. Here is a Conservative Party, Europe's most successful, with a legendary appetite for power, risking its entire future in pursuit of hobgoblins. In a week when Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, got into hot water because he dared to describe Britain's contribution to the technical preparations for a European single currency as ""constructive"", you have to think that this time at least, Brussels has got it right.
Those Tories who see a federalist plot lurking behind everything European will doubtless consider these attitudes in Brussels as simply another part of the plot. They point to scraps of evidence that the federal dream is still alive: to the famous Schauble-Lamers paper, prepared for Germany's Chancellor Kohl as a prospectus for the 1996 intergovernmental conference (IGC) to the odd Christian Democrat, usually again German, who has failed to unlearn the F-word; to the still-rampant ambitions of the European Parliament for more power; and to the fact that economic and monetary union (EMU) remains in theory on the agenda for 1997. But most of this is simply atavistic baggage.
For both the low politics and the high politics of Europe have changed. The low politics changed when many of Europe's people decided they did not like the politics of federation. The Danish referendum on the Maastricht treaty was lost, the French one nearly lost. Norway said ""No"" and Sweden only just said ""Yes"" to membership. These events shook even the federalist dreamers into a realisation that the nation-state lived on.
High politics changed more recently. Jacques Delors, the greatest federalist, has ceased to be president of the European Commission. The new commissioners, who took office on January 23rd, are a pragmatic bunch. Jacques Santer, the commission's new president, is painfully eager to build consensus. Of his 19 fellow commissioners, 16 have been elected politicians, trained to read public opinion. They will never underestimate the nation-state.
There is radical change too among the heads of government who will attend the IGC. The old men of Europe are gone or going: Francois Mitterrand and Giulio Andreotti out; Felipe Gonzalez and Andreas Papandreou, probably out; and some would add John Major. Only Helmut Kohl of the old generation remains in his pomp. And even Mr Kohl's aspirations seem limited. On February 21st, Klaus Kinkel, his foreign minister, set out a notably unambitious statement of Germany's ICC ambitions.
On the real issues confronting the EU, Britain faces more that is promising than is threatening. Eastward enlargement of the Union, which everyone wants once the IGC is done, is an old British aim. With 27 potential members of the EU, a coherent federal state simply ceases to be imaginable. Enlargement will generate more pressure for Britain's other traditional objective, reform of the common agricultural policy. As more states join the EU, the present bias in its voting rules against big states will be changed, delivering a third British objective. Meanwhile, the single market, the cause in which Britain joined the whole enterprise, goes forward. Indeed, the new commission, which is shaping up to be an effective one, will propel a heavier roller across the playing field for competition.
Since the real issues pose no threat, the Tory Europhobes summon up imaginary ones. Immigration policy is one, over which Charles Wardle, a very junior minister, has resigned. British officials are confident of winning the individual cases being brought against the country's controls in the European Court of Justice. British policy will be in danger only if the commission legislates against them--but if push comes to shove, Britain can veto any legislation.
Or take EMU. Everybody in Brussels knows it will not happen in 1997. It is more likely to happen in 1999, but only among some countries. Even if Britain decided not to opt out, as under the Maastricht treaty it may, years will go by before you have a Europunt in your pocket that cannot be devalued. In the meantime, the government will continue to enjoy monetary sovereigntythe sovereignty that has the chancellor on tenterhooks lest the Bundesbank increase rates, a decision which would all but force Britain to follow suit.
Fortunately for Britain, the Brussels B-words have yet seriously to turn to the A-word: anger. Most Europeans still want Britain in, and they rely on the electorate to punish Mr Major for his dithering. The costs of the Tory divisions, therefore, are not yet falling on Britain. They fall entirely on the Conservative Party, which may indeed yet achieve the singular feat of destroying itself over nothing very much at all.","Forget the F-word. Here comes the B-word. In today's European Union, the talk is no longer of federalism. The dream of a European superstate has been abandoned as a new generation of practical European leaders emerges. Britain's oldest EU objective is therefore won. But John Major and his divided party have succeeded in snatching defeat from the jaws of their victory. For the words you now hear around Brussels about Britain and its beleaguered government are these: baffling, bewildering, bemusing, batty. In the chancelleries, in the couloirs, in the cafes, they are waiting for Tony Blair.
And baffling is indeed what Britain's present position is. Here is a nation whose stock-in-trade was pragmatism, hung up on a wholly theoretical debate about European developments which may never happen. Here is a British constitution whose admired virtue was that it delivered strong and decisive executive government, apparently now an instrument of state paralysis. Here is a Conservative Party, Europe's most successful, with a legendary appetite for power, risking its entire future in pursuit of hobgoblins. In a week when Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, got into hot water because he dared to describe Britain's contribution to the technical preparations for a European single currency as ""constructive"", you have to think that this time at least, Brussels has got it right.
Those Tories who see a federalist plot lurking behind everything European will doubtless consider these attitudes in Brussels as simply another part of the plot. They point to scraps of evidence that the federal dream is still alive: to the famous Schauble-Lamers paper, prepared for Germany's Chancellor Kohl as a prospectus for the 1996 intergovernmental conference (IGC) to the odd Christian Democrat, usually again German, who has failed to unlearn the F-word; to the still-rampant ambitions of the European Parliament for more power; and to the fact that economic and monetary union (EMU) remains in theory on the agenda for 1997. But most of this is simply atavistic baggage.
For both the low politics and the high politics of Europe have changed. The low politics changed when many of Europe's people decided they did not like the politics of federation. The Danish referendum on the Maastricht treaty was lost, the French one nearly lost. Norway said ""No"" and Sweden only just said ""Yes"" to membership. These events shook even the federalist dreamers into a realisation that the nation-state lived on.
High politics changed more recently. Jacques Delors, the greatest federalist, has ceased to be president of the European Commission. The new commissioners, who took office on January 23rd, are a pragmatic bunch. Jacques Santer, the commission's new president, is painfully eager to build consensus. Of his 19 fellow commissioners, 16 have been elected politicians, trained to read public opinion. They will never underestimate the nation-state.
There is radical change too among the heads of government who will attend the IGC. The old men of Europe are gone or going: Francois Mitterrand and Giulio Andreotti out; Felipe Gonzalez and Andreas Papandreou, probably out; and some would add John Major. Only Helmut Kohl of the old generation remains in his pomp. And even Mr Kohl's aspirations seem limited. On February 21st, Klaus Kinkel, his foreign minister, set out a notably unambitious statement of Germany's ICC ambitions.
On the real issues confronting the EU, Britain faces more that is promising than is threatening. Eastward enlargement of the Union, which everyone wants once the IGC is done, is an old British aim. With 27 potential members of the EU, a coherent federal state simply ceases to be imaginable. Enlargement will generate more pressure for Britain's other traditional objective, reform of the common agricultural policy. As more states join the EU, the present bias in its voting rules against big states will be changed, delivering a third British objective. Meanwhile, the single market, the cause in which Britain joined the whole enterprise, goes forward.

ANDREAS PAPANDREOU, Greece's ailing prime minister, has become a frail shadow of the filmy radical who in the 1980s threatened to take Greece out of NATO and the European Union. With shuffling gait and voice reduced to a gravelly whisper, he cuts a pathetic figure on television. Ordinary Greeks say they are reminded of the decrepit leaders of Eastern Europe in the dying days of communism.
Some of the governing Panhellenic Socialist Movement's members of parliament grumble that Mr Papandreou should have retired long ago. He is in poor health: he had an open-heart operation in 1988, and the doctors are apparently advising him to have another. The succession battle grows fiercer, as the rival candidates candidly air their views on the party's future. But Mr Papandreou seems bent on carrying on until he drops. And he can still play his political cards pretty shrewdly.
Earlier this month, he made sure that his party had a chance of staying in power for its full four-year term by securing the election of Costis Stephanopoulos, an amiable but ineffectual conservative, as Greece's new president. Without a new president, parliament would have had to be dissolved and the ensuing election might have thrown the Socialists out of power. Mr Papandreou removed that danger by arranging an unusual alliance with Political Spring, a nationalist splinter group, to get the necessary votes for Mr Stephanopoulos.
Like an ageing patriarch putting his affairs in order, Mr Papandreou is now trying to tidy up foreign policy. Greece's awkwardness over the European Union's efforts to improve relations with Turkey and the Balkan states had annoyed its fellow Europeans. After George Mangakis, a trusted Papandreou man, took over the running of European affairs last month, the Greeks began to change their tune. They agreed to Turkey's customs union with the EU in return for a firm timetable for making Cyprus a full member.
They also wound up a year of squabbles with Albania. The rapprochement was sealed on March 19th when the Greek police arrested members of a right-wing Greek terrorist group, the North Epirus Liberation Front, whose members have boasted that last April some of them crossed into Albania and managed to kill two Albanian soldiers.
Even better, Mr Papandreou seems ready to lift his blockade of Macedonia, which he imposed in a fit of pique 13 months ago. Greek businessmen, it seems, are fed up with not being able to invest in the former Yugoslav republic. Greek-Macedonian talks may start next month in New York. Greece may lift its embargo if Macedonia agrees to remove from its flag the star the Greeks associate with ancient Macedonia, and if it abandons any hint of a claim to the Greek province of Macedonia. No more may be heard of the Greek demand that Macedonia should change its own name.
Such statesmanship by Mr Papandreou may do more for Balkan peace than for his own authority. He is under growing pressure to step down. His position is further undermined by gossip about his wife, Dimitra, who runs his private office. Among other things, she is accused of spending too much money--especially for a Socialist--on doing up the Papandreous' new villa in a suburb of Athens, of interfering in the running of Olympic Airways (for which she once worked as a stewardess), and of being enmeshed in a controversial casino deal.
Mr Papandreou has also been attacked by two members of his party's more modern-minded, Euro-enthusiastic wing, Theodoros Pangalos, an outspoken former minister for European affairs, and Vasso Papandreou (no relation), a former European commissioner for social affairs. Both may want his job--but on March 21st they were hauled before a par committee and ticked off for indiscipline. Two mild-mannered men known for their loyalty to Mr Papandreou could also emerge as possible successors: the foreign minister, Carolos Papoulias, and parliament's speaker, Apostolos Kaklamanis.
No bets should yet be laid: Mr Papandreou is keeping his intentions as murky as possible. But few Athenians reckon he will last as prime minister much beyond midsummer.","Andreas Papandreou's has become a frail shadow of the filmy radical who in the 1980s threatened to take Greece out of NATO and the European Union .

WITH Bosnia still in flames, at least one other potentially explosive Balkan dispute seems to have been settled. Greece and Macedonia have grudgingly agreed to end their four-year quarrel over the former Yugoslav republic's determination to adopt an ancient Greek name.
Both south Balkan governments were fed up with feuding. But it was Richard Holbrooke, the American negotiator trying to make peace in ex-Yugoslavia, who--after shutting frantically earlier this month between Athens and Skopje, Macedonia's capital--persuaded the stubborn duo to call it a day.
Greece says it will, within 30 days, lift the trade blockade it imposed on Macedonia in February 1994 and to stop vetoing European Union aid to its neighbour. It will also endorse Macedonian membership of such bodies as the Organisation for Security and Co-operation in Europe. In return, Macedonia will redesign its flag, which annoys the Greeks because it copies the star-burst symbol of their national hero, Alexander the Great, kin of ancient Macedonia. The Macedonians will also change two articles in their constitution in order to rub out any hint of a claim on the Greek province of Macedonia.
Finding a name for Macedonia that the Greeks can accept will come later. The republic is currently known internationally under the acronym FYROM (the ""Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia"").
Thanks to American cajolery, both Greece's prime minister, Andreas Papandreou, and Macedonia's president, Kiro Gligorov, were able to back down without courting political disaster at home. The quarrel has irritated Greece's European partners. Mr Papandreou has been accused of trying to destabilise Macedonia.
Both sides have suffered. Greek exporters have lost an estimated $200m. The ban on Macedonian passport-holders visiting Greece has hurt the economies of Thessaloniki and other northern Greek cities. The Macedonians say the trade blockade was costing them about $40m a month, when account was taken of lost exports and the cost of re-routing goods that used to go through Thessaloniki, the landlocked republic's nearest outlet to the sea.
Better relations with Greece promise to make Macedonia a less fragile state--but still hardly a robust one. With UN sanctions against Serbia, its main trading partner, and the loss of markets in the former Soviet Union, its economy was in tatters even before the Greek blockade. Macedonia's ethnic mix of Slavs and Albanians is volatile. And if Kosovo, the Serb-controlled province with an overwhelmingly Albanian population, were to erupt, violence could easily spill over into next-door Macedonia.
That might well draw Albania itself and even Turkey into a war to protect fellow Muslims. Greece might then join in, under the banner of defending its northern borders. For the Americans, who have 500 troops in Macedonia as part of a UN preventive deployment, averting a south Balkan conflict between two NATO members could be as important as bringing peace to Bosnia.","ATHENS

It was a sign, more reassuring than any spokesman's statement, that Boris Nikolaevich, albeit in hospital, was probably not at death's door.
But sick Russia's president has been, and sick he will remain, for some time at least. The recurrence of his long-standing heart trouble was provoked, officials said, by the exhausting pace of his recent trips to France and America. All the same, Mr Yeltsin had barely resumed serious work after a previous bout of heart trouble in July. Another month in bed, a month or so of convalescence, then the Christmas holiday season, and Mr Yeltsin will have been a rare sight in the Kremlin for more than half a year.
It is all too easy to assume that this second illness must bring Mr Yeltsin's political career to a close, and that he will retire when his term ends in June, if not before. He is, by Russia's measure, old: at 64 he has already exceeded by seven years the life expectancy of the average Russian man. His self-discipline seems to be ebbing: he would be less prone to erratic behaviour if he would only pursue a more abstemious life, yet he cannot bring himself to do so.
But fin-de-regne speculation is risky anywhere, and not least in today's Russia. Perhaps it might be better for all concerned if Mr Yeltsin did take the hint from on high, bowing out while the verdict of history is still just about in his favour. The sweeping powers of the Russian president are dangerous things to have in shaky or suggestible hands. But Mr Yeltsin himself probably does not see things that way; and this is what matters.
Start asking who will make Mr Yeltsin go, and the answer is far from clear. Not necessarily the voters, whatever the opinion polls may say now. Many countries have a soft spot for incumbent leaders regardless of ae or infirmity. Set against Winston Churchill or Andreas Papandreou in their old age, Mr Yeltsin is positively surging with vim. So long as he can pull himself together for a month's campaigning in the summer, then there is no compelling reason why he should not seek a second term, and possibly even get one.
Take into account the mediocrity of his likely opponents, the possibility that by next summer Russia's economy may be showing signs of recovery, and--by no means least--the influence of a presidential entourage that will be out of work if its leader retires. All these might push Mr Yeltsin to run. The one person who might compel him to give up is Mr Yeltsin himself; yet, the weaker he becomes, the more his advisers will be able to shape his decisions.
Instead of writing Mr Yeltsin's obituary, it might be wiser to pencil him in as a stayer, and to wonder how, for at least the next few months and perhaps for the next few years, Russia would behave under a presidency that is strong in theory but weak in practice.
Parliament, most obviously, may have a chance to extend its authority if the lower house, the Duma, can organise itself coherently around a stable majority after December's parliamentary election. In any constitutional battle between president and parliament, the great prize will be de facto control of the prime minister, and with him the government. Parliamentarians planning for a battle can take heart from the fine print of Russia's 1993 constitution.
The constitution says that the president appoints the prime minister with the ""consent"" of parliament. In effect, a vote of confidence is required. Mr Yeltsin has avoided one so far by leaving in place a prime minister, Viktor Chernomyrdin, whose appointment predates the 1993 constitution and for whom fresh ""consent"" has not been needed. The Duma could have challenged Mr Chernomyrdin by passing two successive votes of no confidence, enough to overturn the government. But in that event the constitution allows the president the option of dissolving the Duma instead of changing the government. The fear of dissolution has been enough to deter the outgoing Duma from insurrection.
The next Duma, however, will arrive fortified by the knowledge that the constitution bars the president from dissolving it for 12 months after it has been elected. So if Mr Yeltsin looks weak, and if December's vote produces a Communist-led coalition in the Duma, as it may, then battle will undoubtedly be joined. Russia has, moreover, none of the institutional strengths and accumulated political wisdom that enabled France to accommodate two periods of cohabitation between a president and a hostile government. A Russian cohabitation could be a messier affair, paralysing government.
Uncertainty over Mr Yeltsin affects two other issues. One is the balance of power between the centre and the provinces. If the central government weakens, local governments gain. Reform has already devolved much economic power away from the centre. A shift from appointed to elected local leaders is steadily strengthening the regions' political clout. This is by no means a matter for regret. Though some local governments are bastions of repressive conservatism, others are vigorous and reformist. Even the best of their leaders are not yet bored or restive. Men such as Boris Nemtsov, the governor of Nizhni Novgorod, and Yuri Luzhkov, the mayor of Moscow, do not look on their jobs as mere stepping-stones to national office, though they, or their successors, may one day come to do so.
Less happily, a weaker presidency probably means more clout for the army. Even now, it is pushing definitions to say that Russia's armed forces are under civilian control. It happens that the defence minister, General Pavel Grachev, defers to the president. But a future stronger defence minister might not. The danger is not that the army will chase a weak president out, but that it will simply ignore him--daring any government to deny it the resources to pursue its own interests.
It may be, too, that a weaker president will not translate directly into a weaker presidency. The power escaping from Mr Yeltsin may be captured, not by other institutions, but by people close to him who will exercise it in his name.
The prime candidate for eminence grise in such circumstances would be General Alexander Korzhakov, Mr Yeltsin's security chief, who was the president's only nonfamily visitor in the first days of his current illness. Much is muttered darkly about Mr Korzhakov, but little known for sure other than that he has served in the KGB and plays a competent game of tennis. Should Mr Yeltsin hang on to office while ceding power to a Kremlin ""kitchen cabinet"", the consequences for Russian policy cannot be predicted. But the consequences for Russian democracy will necessarily be severe.","WHEN Naina Yeltsin turned up for the opening of a chi - chi cosmetics shop off Red Square this week , worries about her husband 's health abated .

Andreas Papandreou, Greece's prime minister, is in hospital, stricken with pneumonia. His voluptuous young wife Dimitra is constantly at his bedside. His ex-wife Margaret and their grown-up children come and go, looking distraught. The paparazzi are poised outside the gleaming Onasseion Cardiac Centre, given to the nation by another Greek with an eye for the ladies, Aristotle Onassis. Papandreou loyalists shout insults at dissident members of the governing Socialist party arriving to pay what they probably hope will be their last respects.
 But is it the final episode? Like characters in ""Dallas"", a favourite with Greek television viewers, Mr Papandreou has bounced back to life before. He has survived open-heart surgery, three election defeats and a trial for corruption, of which he was acquitted by one vote. His tenacity was rewarded when voters nostalgic for the freespending policies of the 1980s swept his Socialists back to power two years ago.
But a full recovery looks less likely this time. Not only is Mr Papandreou's health much worse--he has stomach and liver problems as well as a weak heart--but his party is growing impatient for a change of leader. Even if he gets over the pneumonia, it could be several months before he is strong enough to chair a cabinet meeting, let alone attend a European Union summit.
He was rushed to hospital five days before a party meeting at which the ""gang of four"", as the party's main dissident faction is known, planned to force a showdown over the succession. The meeting has been cancelled. The show of sick-bed unity the party is now putting on is unlikely to last more than a couple of weeks.
The four--Costas Simitis, Vasso Papandreou (no relation), Theodoros Pangalos and Paraskevas Avgerinos--are all ex-cabinet ministers who believe that Greece must pull its economy into shape, build better ties with its Balkan neighbours and generally get closer to its EU partners. Miss Papandreou used to be the Union's social-affairs commissioner, Mr Pangalos Greece's energetic minister for Europe.
Until events overtook them, the four wanted Mr Papandreou to agree on how the party should choose a new prime minister, and on a time for his retirement. Right now, it is unclear whether a new person would be elected by a party congress, by the Socialists' 150-member central committee or by their 170 members of parliament. If Mr Papandreou hangs on long enough to convene a congress, the pro-European faction will be at a disadvantage. Neither Mr Simitis nor Miss Papandreou, the rebel quartet's candidates for prime minister, can be sure of backing from the grass-roots Socialists who would be delegates at the congress.
As the highest-ranking cabinet member, Akis Tsohatzopoulos, minister for public administration, is standing in as prime minister. He is also a leader of the party's populists, who care more about staying in power than meeting the Maastricht targets for Europe's monetary union. These Socialists would not hesitate to drop policies that have squeezed wages and pensions, increased unemployment among the young and made farmers, for the first time, pay tax.
But if Mr Papandreou resigns while in hospital, it is the Socialists in parliament who would be required under the constitution to vote for a new prime minister. The ""gang of four"" is liked by other backbenchers. It would be much easier for Mr Simitis to strike a deal with Mr Tsohatzopoulos and the populists in the corridors of parliament, than at a full-blooded party gathering.","IT HAS been a gripping week for devotees of a soap opera called Greek politics .

The prospects are not encouraging. One reason is the sheer difficulty of the various tasks. But just as important are the political frailties of the EU'S leaders. Moreover, some of the most influential are among the most vulnerable.
Ironically, that does not include Jacques Chirac. For all the French president's plunging popularity, his term in office still has more than six years to runand it is almost impossible to topple a French president prematurely. Nor, if the opinion polls are right, does it include the German chancellor, Helmut Kohl, who, unless he is tempted to call a snap poll (see page 45), has nearly three years to go before the next general election. Neither man is as threatened as the other leaders of the EU'S big countries: Spain's Felipe Gonzalez, Italy's Lamberto Dini and Britain's John Major. Their difficulties are both grave and obvious.
Mr Gonzalez, whose country is due to go to the polls in March, heads a government made tired and corrupt by 13 years in office. Mr Dini is a technocratic caretaker trying to instil some responsibility into the system before the unruly tide of normal Italian politics sweeps him away. And Mr Major, with a wafer-thin majority in parliament (even thinner, this week, after another MP'S death), will be held hostage by his party's Eurosceptics until an election due by May 1997.
 To these weaknesses in the EU'S big countries can be added strength-sapping problems in many of the smaller ones. In Greece, the departure from politics of the terminally ill prime minister, Andreas Papandreou, will mean upheaval in the ruling socialist party, Pasok, which he created a generation ago. In Belgium, the fiscal austerity of Jean-Luc Dehaene's coalition is being challenged--shades of France--by demonstrations and sudden strikes. In Sweden, Denmark and Austria there are British-sounding strains of Euroscepticism. In other words, even ifrather a big if--Europe's Franco-German ""engine"" is healthy, the rest of the train seems to be coming off the rails.
As Mr Gonzalez has warned his fellow leaders, the crucial year for Europe will be 1998. That is the deadline for selecting the countries for a single currency; for beginning negotiations with aspiring EU members; for scrutinising the defence treaty of the Western European Union; for working out a new financial framework for the EU--which must surely also involve revising the policies on farming and regional aid. Implementing all or even any of these policies will require tough decisions, such as facing down farmers and cutting public spending in most countries.

""Almost like a biblical patriarch from a far-off time"" was the Stuttgarter Zeitung's phrase for the man who died on January 8th. The Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung described the 12 years when he was president of France and Helmut Kohl chancellor of Germany as the two countries' ""most fruitful era of co-operation"", outshining even the pioneering reconciliation of de Gaulle and Adenauer in the 1950s.
Whether or not Mr Mitterrand himself was a historic figure--in most areas of policy he seemed more a manipulator than a maker of events--there is some justice in the claim that his l4-year presidency did indeed mark a golden age for Franco-German relations. Jacques Delors as president of the European Commission, Helmut Kohl as leader of Germany and Mr Mitterrand presiding over France made a trio that defined a particular view of what Europe should be: an ever-closer union of countries, based on the all-important French-German alliance, which, they hoped, would survive the post-communist redrawing of the map of Europe.
Will it? In comparison with that presumed golden age, the current combination of Kohl and Chirac seems iron-grey with doubt. Over the past few months, the French government has endured the biggest wave of unrest in France since 1968 in pursuit of public-spending reforms which, necessary though they are anyway, have been given extra urgency by the Maastricht treaty's criteria for economic and monetary union (EMU). At the same time, the German finance minister, Theo Waigel, has demanded even tougher conditions for EMU, which if implemented would require monetary-union countries to run virtually balanced budgets.
More than that, Mr Kohl and other Germans have spelled out with growing clarity what they really want from EMU and from German relations with France: a steady progress towards political union. Germany wants to limit the use of national vetoes in EU decisions and to boost the powers of the European Parliament. France demurs. In place of the German model of a more federal Europe, Jacques Chirac wants a multispeed one based on co-operation between national govemments. This means strengthening the Council of Ministers at the expense of the European Parliament.
 To these big strains, add some smaller but still painful ones. Mr Kohl disagreed with Mr Chirac's decision to resume nuclear testing (though he refrained from saying so in public). Germany is disappointed that France, ostensibly worried about terrorists and drug-traffickers, has more or less opted out of the Schengen agreement to free the movement of people within Europe. Mr Chirac has moved France closer to NATO, even though this casts doubt on his commitment to the single European defence system sought by believers in a federal Europe.
 None of this means that the Franco-German alliance is dead, or even that it has ceased to be the most important cross-border bond in Europe. But it is plainly under greater strain than ever before.
Some people, notably Mr Delors, have blamed this chiefly on France, with its troublesome public finances and the replacement of the ""visionary"" Mitterrand by the less predictable, neo-Gaullist Chirac. Clearly, Mr Chirac's advent has signalled a change in Franco-German relations. But to argue that the fissures are appearing largely because of changes in France is to miss a series of wider changes affecting all Europe.
The most striking of these is the emergence of a cluster of post-communist states to the east of Germany which want to be members of the EU. This was bound to change Germany's view of Europe, and of its own interests, regardless of what happened in France. Many people feared-and still fear-that the expansion of the EU to these countries, coupled with the effect of German unification, would create a German-dominated block that might eventually come to control the Union. Here was one major change of the early 1990s.
Yet the same communist collapse which made possible these post-communist applications also allowed the expansion of the EU to three countries-Finland, Sweden and Austria-which, during the cold war, had held aloof from the European experiment. This gave another twist to the emerging shape of Europe. Perhaps surprisingly, Sweden and Finland, far from proving enthusiasts for ""ever-closer"" European union, have so far been somewhat Euro-sceptical.
 On the southern side of the continent, a different process is in train, which also reveals the fragility of that supposed ""golden age"". One of the great projects of the 1980s was the nurturing of the new democracies of Spain, Portugal and Greece, all of them also new members of the European enterprise.
All of these countries are now passing through troubles a little like those of postMitterrand France, as new governments bid to take over from leaders too long in power. Portugal holds a presidential election on January 14th after the retirement of Mario Soares, the Socialist who has been president since 1986. Spain faces a general election on March 3rd, in which the conservative Popular Party currently looks like beating the Socialist government of Felipe Gonzalez, prime minister since 1982. In Greece, an unseemly succession struggle is raging around the sick-bed, which is possibly the deathbed, of Andreas Papandreou, prime minister since 1981.
This is more than just remarkable coincidence. A new generation is coming to power across Mediterranean Europe, in countries where Socialist parties have long been the vehicles for charismatic leaders. This generational change marks a point of political transition. When the old leaders took office, their democracies were new and untested. Now, partly thanks to membership of the European Union, Spain and Portugal are solid democracies and in Greece, though there may still be intermittent worries, the possibilities of disruption have been constrained. In this sense, the European project in the Mediterranean has achieved its first aim of cementing democracy. The new generation faces what is likely to prove a very different Euro-test: working in the second division of Europe if EMU comes about and, as seems likely, the Mediterranean countries (Italy included) fail to qualify for it.
The new European pattern
Put all these pieces of the European puzzle together and a new pattern emerges strikingly different from the Mitterrand-Kohl ""golden age"". Then, there was one all-important tie that bound Germany into a Union which had a clear sense of direction. Now, a multiplicity of ties is emergingsome strong, others weak-binding Germany, like Gulliver in Lilliput, into a Union which, though clinging to an EMU blueprint, is in reality unsure where it is going.
Some regard this emerging pattern as disastrous. Senior Germans from Mr Kohl down still argue that a united Germany will be too powerful to be constrained by a network of smaller, weaker states. It needs, they say, the anchor of a strong tie with France. Otherwise, in the shorthand of diplomacy, the result will be a ""German Europe"", not a ""European Germany"".
It remains to be seen whether that gloomy forecast will prove justified. But two things are already becoming clearer: first, that network of smaller ties is appearing, willy-nilly. And second, this is happening partly because the old model, which has its conclusion in EMU, is anyway tending to produce what some other countries see as a ""German Europe"" because Germany's demands for political union and iron fiscal discipline under a common currency are making a new Europe in Germany's image. Perhaps that ""golden age"" was not so golden after all.","TO MANY Germans, the death of Francois Mitterrand marked the passing of a golden age.

The answer from Greece is: a political vacuum develops until the leader responds. Its prime minister, Andreas Papandreou, lay in hospital, intermittently on a life-support machine, for two months before deciding, on January 15th, to resign, allowing his party to elect a new leader. For much of that time his party refused to admit there was even a problem.
Greece is not unusual in having, in effect, no provision against incapacitation. Britain went through similar crises of nonauthority during the illnesses of Anthony Eden and Winston Churchill.
In Russia, the constitution says there must be an election within three months in case of the president's ""persistent inability to exercise his powers for health reasons."" But who decides whether he has reached this state? That question did not need to be faced last year because Boris Yeltsin recovered from two heart attacks. But it may yet have to be faced--and the recent example of France suggests that secrecy or lies will then be the order of the day.
According to Claude Gubler, Franoois Mitterrand's doctor until 1994, the president was told that he was suffering from prostate cancer in 1981 and that it had spread to his bones. Mitterrand reportedly ordered that no one should be told-not even his wife-and for many years he responded miraculously to treatment. In 1992, after 11 years of medical bulletins saying his health was normal, the French were told that he was suffering from the cancer but that the disease had been discovered early enough to prevent it interfering with the performance of his duties. Yet, says Dr Gubler, ""by November 1994 [six months before the end of his second seven year term], I considered Francois Mitterrand no longer capable of carrying out his functions."" This was not because Mitterrand's mental faculties were impaired; the president, however, ""no longer worked, because nothing interested him, save his illness.""
These allegations have been denied by the president's aides. The medical profession has threatened sanctions against Dr Gubler and the Mitterrand family has ordered the book that contains them, ""The Great Secret"", to be seized on the ground that it violates the late president's privacy, a crime in France.
In theory, such a row should never have occurred. Under the French constitution, it is up to a nine-member Constitutional Council (not the president) to decide, on the request of the government, whether ""for any reason"" the president is temporarily or permanently impeded from carrying out his duties. If this is deemed to be so, the presidential functions will be taken over by the president of the Senate until either the impediment has been removed, or new elections can be organised.
But if the president is under the protection of his aides and doctors, how can the government or the Constitutional Council hope to acquire the information to make a judgment? The latest suggestion is that an independent team of doctors should be appointed, to report regularly to the Constitutional Council on the president's state of health. Other countries might consider such a course too.","WHAT happens when the leader of a country can not carry out his duties because of ill health ? The answer from Greece is : a political vacuum develops until the leader responds . Andreas Papandreou's lay in hospital , intermittently on a life - support machine , for two months before deciding , on January 15th , to resign , allowing Andreas Papandreou's party to elect a new leader . For much of that time Andreas Papandreou's party refused to admit there was even a problem . 
 Greece is not unusual in having , in effect , no provision against incapacitation . Britain went through similar crises of nonauthority during the illnesses of Anthony Eden and Winston Churchill . 
 In Russia , the constitution says there must be an election within three months in case of the president 's "" persistent inability to exercise his powers for health reasons . "" But who decides whether he has reached this state ? That question did not need to be faced last year because Boris Yeltsin recovered from two heart attacks . But it may yet have to be faced -- and the recent example of France suggests that secrecy or lies will then be the order of the day . 
 According to Claude Gubler , Franoois Mitterrand 's doctor until 1994 , the president was told that he was suffering from prostate cancer in 1981 and that it had spread to his bones . Mitterrand reportedly ordered that no one should be told - not even his wife - and for many years he responded miraculously to treatment . In 1992 , after 11 years of medical bulletins saying his health was normal , the French were told that he was suffering from the cancer but that the disease had been discovered early enough to prevent it interfering with the performance of his duties . Yet , says Dr Gubler , "" by November 1994 [ six months before the end of his second seven year term ] , I considered Francois Mitterrand no longer capable of carrying out his functions . "" This was not because Mitterrand 's mental faculties were impaired ; the president , however , "" no longer worked , because nothing interested him , save his illness . ""

Even more remarkable for a Greek politician, he would like to improve relations with Turkey, Greece's traditional foe.

Mr Simitis is bland by comparison with Mr Papandreou. But that seems to be what Greek voters now want.

Mr Simitis won over, in the election, Costas Laliotis, the public-works minister and influential fixer in the party machine. The new prime minister has tried to mollify his defeated rivals by leaving them in their jobs and by sharing out junior cabinet posts fairly equally between populists and pro-Europeans.

Nor is the contest yet over for Mr Simitis. He will be up for election again in June, this time as leader of Pasok. Delegates to a special party congress must then pick a successor to Mr Papandreou. Though the prime minister does not have to be party leader, if Mr Simitis stood and were defeated, that would be seen as a vote of no confidence in him and would wreck his prime ministership.

THE appointment last month of Costas Simitis as prime minister of Greece was good news. In a three-way contest among the ruling party's top parliamentarians, he was plainly the best candidate. Though Greece is still awash with problems, the country had begun to perk up even before Mr Simitis took the top job. Will this latest, rare burst of hope come to anything, or will Greece relapse into bad old ways?
Most Greeks are keen to give Mr Simitis a chance. Even his opponents on the Greek right are inclined, for the time being, to be generous. ""He's decent and honest,"" says a rising right-wing member of parliament-a compliment rarely bestowed by Greek politicians even on their allies. ""Uncharismatic, of course, but reliable, moderateand a social democrat."" Not, be it noted, ""a Socialist"", though Mr Simitis's party calls itself the Pan-Hellenic Socialist Movement, familiarly abbreviated to Pasok
The retirement of 77-year-old Andreas Papandreou, who has been on life-support machines since November, brought a sigh of relief Under his aegis, Greece had become the bad-joke member of the European club. Mr Papandreou, who won power in 1981 and had held it ever since, except for a break between 1989 and 1993, had caused constant headaches for most of his western counterparts and was a dreadful advertisement for Greece: a brilliant manipulative populist, but cynical, profligate, demagogic, a master of patronage, prejudice and intrigue.
Mr Simitis, at 59, brings a whiff of fresh air. He has swept most of Mr Papandreou's court out of the new cabinet. The third and current Mrs Papandreou and her friends will no longer have a say in public-works contracts. Cabinet meetings will, it is said, be regular and more ""transparent"". Mr Simitis carries no taint of corruption. Nor is he surrounded by a coterie of identifiable hangers-on or big-business pals, though he was undoubtedly the businessman's choice for prime minister.
A former law lecturer in Germany who was also educated in Britain, Mr Simitis is keen to undo Greece's reputation as the delinquent of the European Union. Mr Papandreou, who at first opposed Greek membership, gave the impression that the EU was simply Greece's milch cow; Mr Simitis stresses Greece's obligations. His closest backers, Theodoros Pangalos, the new foreign minister, and Vasso Papandreou (no relation), a former European commissioner who heads a new super-ministry, are seasoned Brussels operators who should help keep the EU money gushing.
Mr Simitis also has the good fortune to arrive in power just when Greece is showing signs of slowly clambering out of its deep economic pit. The core of an able economic team is already in place, with three youngish ""Papas"" in the key jobs: Loukas Papademos at the central bank, Yannos Papantoniou at economic planning, and Alekos Papadopoulos at finance. The trio are zealous converts to austerity, monetary rigour and, albeit of a gradual and partial kind, privatisation.
Under their lash, the figures have already begun to look less horrible. Inflation, at 10.8% in 1994, dropped to 8.1% at the end of last year. The deficit fell to 8.9% of GDP against 9.7% for the previous year(the target for the EU's economic and monetary union is 3%). Growth, at minus 0.5% in 1993 and 1.5% in 1994, was 2% last year and, they hope, will reach 2.8% this year.
Drastic measures have been taken to improve tax collection. The taxman is now entitled to levy an ""imputed income tax"" on the basis of people's trappings of wealth (fancy cars, new houses, and so on). In the past many Greeks, especially the self employed and professionals such as lawyers and doctors, as well as farmers (who paid no income tax at all), have managed to plead ridiculously low earnings.
Yet the underlying facts of the economy remain bleak. Greece's GDP growth rate over the past 15 years, at 1.6%, is half the EU average. It still has the highest inflation rate in the Union, the lowest productivity, the biggest national-debt ratio, the highest general-government budget deficit as a percentage of GDP, the worst trade imbalance. Only unemployment, at 9.6%, is roughly at the EU's average. And all this despite receiving the largest handouts from the Eu: $15.9 billion spread over the current five-year period (1994-99), plus at least another $5 billion in soft Euro-loans-in total, more than 6% of Greece's GDP. But Greece has failed dismally to make good use of this massive amount of money or, in the past, to give a good account for how it is spent.
Mr Simitis is determined to change Greece's reputation for being a wastrel. He is also keen to make Greece more loved in its ""near abroad"". His wary handling of a recent row with Turkey over a rocky outcrop in the Aegean was a good sign. He has been roundly castigated in Greece for backing down, but it was the right thing to do. Dealing calmly with Turkey, the old enemy, is his top foreign priority.
The end of the cold-war balance of fear in south-eastern Europe, and then the war in ex Yugoslavia, mayhem in the Caucasus and Turkish prickliness, revived many of Greece's ancient anxieties. Its support in exYugoslavia for its fellow Orthodox Serbs has been astonishingly crude. It has mishandled relations with next-door Albania, Macedonia and Bulgaria. But, once again, Mr Simitis has luck on his side. Relations with Greece's three Balkan neighbours are improving. If peace in Bosnia holds, Greece can prosper as a trading country at the foot of the Balkans.
The worst failing of Greek foreign policy, though, is still rooted in history. True, Greece's borders and territory have been disarmingly fluid for the past 150 years. Enemy armies have crossed Greece's northern borders three times this century. All the same, too many Greeks still see their country as a permanent underdog, endlessly ""betrayed"" by big-power or Muslim conspiracies. Mr Papandreou was expert at tapping into such Balkan paranoia. Mr Simitis may be less inclined to do so.
Yet the toughest job of all will be to change Greece's backward political culture. Most Greeks still view political parties as purveyors of perks and jobs, rather than principles. Until now parties have invariably revolved around ""big men"", often scions of political dynasties and masters of patronage. This old Ottoman system of rousfeti-you scratch my back and I'll scratch yours-infects the huge and bloated public sector, a far too political judiciary and a press that has forgotten-if it ever knew-how to be independent.
Mr Simitis is not strong enough to attack such glaring defects head-on. He has no punch inside Pasok's party machine. He was made prime minister by a small margin. He is not yet formal leader of the party, a job that still belongs to Mr Papandreou. Mr Simitis needs the extra clout the party leadership would give him if he is not to lose his early momentum.
He could lose it anyway. He can be indecisive. As a leader, he is untested. He has only a year and a bit before the next general election. The other would-be within Pasok-people like Messrs Papantoniou and Papadopoulos-are half a generation younger. Greece may have to wait a while for real modernity to arrive.","ATHENS

Greece moving in the right direction. Worries about Turkey and infighting within his Panhellenic Socialist Movement (Pasok) have meant that Mr Simitis has been unable to devote enough time to the economy.

Mr Simitis has one other useful weapon: most Greeks still like his performance. 
His start, though, has been inauspicious. An argument with Turkey over the ownership of some rocks in the Aegean broke out within days of his appointment. Mr Simitis sensibly let the Americans prod him into compromise, which his enemies derided as a humiliating climbdown.

He is occasionally glimpsed on television. He may appear briefly at the party congress. As Pasok's founder, he will stay on as chairman-for-life, but he is physically and politically too weak to stop Mr Simitis from strengthening his grip. 
Part of Mr Simitis's appeal is his very lack of the charisma that Mr Papandreou had in spades.

He usually walks to work and sometimes chats with old pals from the Panteios School of 
Political Science in a local cafe. No whiff of corruption hangs over his earnest advisers. 
But that pleasant prime ministerial change of style will not be enough, on its own, to drag Greece out of its foreign-policy and economic troubles. This month Turkey raised the stakes in the Aegean by questioning Greek sovereignty over yet another tiny island, Gavdos. This latest flashpoint lies south of Crete, closer to Libya than to Turkey. Moving from verbal to lethal exchanges of fire cannot be ruled out. 
Tension with the Turks is bad for the economy. Mr Simitis seems likely to give in to the hard men in his cabinet, such as Gerasimos Arsenis, the defence minister and another of Mr Simitis's rivals, who now cites Gavdos-among other things-as a reason for boosting the defence budget. 
Mr Arsenis says Greece must buy new fighter aircraft and weapons systems. The defence budget this year is already 4.6% of GDP, the highest proportion in NATo. Another big jump could wipe out the gains of the past five painful years, which have seen the public-sector deficit slowly but steadily shrinking.

He was also one of the most controversial. His political skills were enormous, but so were his follies. Perhaps his most remarkable achievement was that, after he won power in 1981, a solid two-fifths (or more) of the Greek people continued to vote for him however much his policies zigzagged, however demagogic his rhetoric, however erratic his fiscal management, however corrupt his inner court of cronies, however exotic his private life. 
It is hard to say exactly what Mr Papandreou stood for. As a youth he was arrested as a Trotskyite. Emigrating to America in 1938, he made good as a liberal economist. He returned to his Greek roots after two decades, only to be exiled again in 1967 (after eight months in prison) following the colonels' putsch. When the colonels' junta collapsed, he returned in 1974, and founded his Pan-Hellenic Socialist Movement, known as Pasok. If Pasok's charter had a Marxist ring about it, Mr Papandreou's rhetoric sounded fiercely nationalist and socialist. Over the years the rhetoric and Pasok veered wildly, according to the political suitability of the moment, but became more or less social democratic 
In foreign policy, as in economics, Mr Papandreou was a tangle of contradictions, none of which seemed to hamper him. At first fiercely opposed to the European Union, Mr Papandreou kept Greece in the club, becoming adept at milking it of money which now accounts for 6% of Greece's GDP. He threatened to veto Spain's and Portugal's membership of the EU unless poor countries got even more handouts from the rich. In NATO he stressed Greece's strategic place as an outpost of democracy in the Balkans, although here again he was an awkward partner, blocking NATO decisions. His most constant weapon was a brilliant populism, occasionally larded-after the colonels' erawith a virulent anti-Americanism and a fuzzy third-worldliness. 
Making mischief 
He triumphed in a ""short march to power"" from 1974, when his fledgling Pasok won 14% of votes cast, to 1981, when he won a crushing general election victory with 48%. In 1993, having only recently been acquitted by a single vote on a charge of corruption, Mr Papandreou led his party to victory with a no less remarkable 47% of the vote. 
Despite being on life-support machines since last autumn, he surrendered the prime-ministership only in January. He remained leader of Pasok until his death. Through his cronies and his latest (third) wife, a former air hostess 36 years his junior and regarded by some as ridiculously vulgar, he had begun to make mischief even for the current, more modern-minded, prime minister, Costas Simitis. 
His solid achievements in office were social reforms, boosting the health service and welfare system, and the healing of the wounds of Greece's civil war (1946-49) which enabled thousands of ex-communists to gain pensions (and jobs for their children in an ever-more-bloated public sector). 
His failings included the massive debt accumulated as a result of reckless spending in the 1980s and dismal growth: his socialist populism frightened off many Greek entrepreneurs, so that billions of dollars that might have been invested in Greece went abroad. 
His zeal for making a populist splash prompted him periodically to pander to the Soviet Union (backing the Russian version, for instance, of the downing of a South Korean aircraft in 1983) and to give solace to the likes of Libya's Colonel Qaddafi and assorted Palestinian terrorists. His sure-fire vote winner was a blazing anti-Turkish vehemence. He failed signally to take advantage of the overtures of the then Turkish leader, Turgut Ozal, in the late 198os. In the past few years, his support for Serbia in Bosnia and his refusal to recognise Macedonia because of its name squandered Greece's chance to help make the Balkans safer. Mr Papandreou was supremely skilled at exploiting Greeks' lingering sense that they are one of history's victims. 
He perpetuated the tradition that politics is essentially a game of patronage, to be controlled by a strongman and a cabal of corrupt insiders, often underpinned by a dynasty. Mr Papandreou's father had twice been prime minister (once running a party modestly called the George Papandreou Party) The name continues in Greek politics: Mr Papandreou put his own (rather decent) son in his cabinet. Rousfeti-a word of Turkish origin denoting the reciprocal dispensation of favours-has remained the norm. For Mr Papandreou, Greek voters were clients. 
With luck the consensus-seeking Mr Simitis will now secure the party leadership and, with some able young technocrats already running key ministries, will help Greece shed the worst of his predecessor's legacy. Mr Papandreou was charming, clever and a populist genius. But he held back Greece's economic and political growth.

His opponent for the leadership of the ruling PanHellenic Socialist Movement (Pasok), Akis Tsochatzopoulos, ranted hoarsely in a final bid for votes. Most Greeks watching last week's congress, broadcast live on television,wanted Mr Simitis to win. He did, by a slimmish margin, getting 54% of the votes cast. Mr Simitis also won control of Pasok's zoo-member central committee, its main decision-making body. But his duel with Mr Tsochatzopoulos is not over. 
Because the congress opened the day af ter the elaborate state funeral of Andreas Papandreou, Pasok's founder, emotions were running unusually high. Mr Simitis's criticism of Mr Papandreou's autocratic ways further raised the temperature. So did his threat to resign as prime minister if he failed to become Pasok's chairman. Most members of Pasok's ""politburo"" (a nickname reflecting the party's Marxist origins) favoured a power-sharing deal to split the jobs of prime minister and party leader and so curb Mr Simitis's zeal for economic reform. The politburo will be replaced by a new executive to Mr Simitis's liking. 
So Mr Simitis can now pursue his hopes of dragging Greece out of its Balkan backwardness and raising it to something like West European levels of efficiency. The day after his victory, foreign investors keen to take advantage of high interest rates on a new issue of government bonds pumped in more than $5oom. Greece is at last setting up an agency to shepherd foreign companies through the bureaucratic maze and help them get government grants to set up factories in the north-eastern province of Thrace, within easy reach of new markets opening up around the Black Sea. Cutting red tape should also speed the disbursement of another lo billion ecus ($iz.4 billion) of European Union grants for improving Greece's roads, ports and railways. If Mr Simitis succeeds in easing tension with Turkey in the Aegean, still more foreign capital should flow in. 
His victory should also break the budget log-jam. His scheme to cut 300 billion drachmas ($1.2 billion) a year from government spending-1.5% of GDP--should now, after languishing on his desk for months, win the party's approval. Controls on procurement for hospitals, clinics and so on would be tightened, and local-government spending capped. 
But the biggest battle will be over that curse of Mr Papandreou's Greece: patronage. Mr Simitis wants to cut the public-sector payroll by hiring only one new civil servant for every three who leave. But the 4o% of Pasok's members who are public-sector workers will fight ferociously to keep their jobs and win new ones for cousins and friends. Mr Tsochatzo poulos, the public-administration minister who has let public-sector employment grow by 2.7% in little over a year, is right behind them. 
For the moment, Mr Simitis is being gentle. Rather than sack Mr Tsochatzopoulos and his cabinet supporters forthwith, he will try to win them over. If he fails, he will have no choice but to call an early election, probably this autumn. Opinion polls suggest he would win. He might then start, in earnest, to destroy Mr Papandreou's legacy of an all-powerful, bloated and corrupt state.

No matter who was in power in Athens, conservative or socialist ministers have been happy to embrace President Slobodan Milosevic of Serbia or, somewhat more quietly, the Bosnian Serbs' Radovan Karadzic. ""Traditional friendship"" is the name of the bond-though that rests on little more than fighting on the same side against the Ottoman Turks in a couple of short-lived Balkan wars. The deeper reason, of course, is residual hatred for Greece's old Turkish oppressor, and a crude identification of the Bosnian cause with an age-old Turkish-Muslim struggle against Orthodox Christianity. 
Other less historic factors have tightened the bond. Greek businessmen have made vast profits by selling oil and spares to Serbs hamstrung by United Nations sanctions. America and Greece's fellow members of the European Union complained several times during the war about Greek sanctions-busting. 
It is not surprising, then, that as pressure grows on Mr Karadzic, for whom an international arrest warrant is out, his mind should turn to Greece as a possible haven. One refuge he apparently has in mind is Mount Athos, the ""autonomous monastic republic"" in northern Greece. The monks ban women. But they have fewer qualms about accepting outlaws, who have frequently found solace within the ancient hilltop walls. The remote Hiliandariou monastery, founded in the 12th century by Prince Stefan Nemanja of Serbia, could be Mr Karadzic's first choice, though he might find it easier to disappear into the depths of Russia, his other most likely place of asylum. But Athos could still beckon. From Macedonia, it is but a hop by helicopter. And it would be almost impossible for the Greek authorities to winkle him out of an Orthodox sanctuary. The government could merrily shrug its shoulders. 
Meanwhile, Alexandros Lykourezos, Greece's best-known criminal lawyer, has offered his services to General Ratko Mladic, the Bosnian Serbs' commander, who has been indicted, along with Mr Karadzic, for war crimes. The flamboyant Mr Lykourezos says he is willing to defend the general if he ends up before the tribunal at The Hague. 
As for Mr Milosevic, his predilection for Greece is plain. Last year his family bought a villa in a smart Athens suburb. One place where he often chooses to relax is Elounda, a resort on Crete; a private jet flies him in and out. Last month he combined the funeral of Greece's late prime minister, Andreas Papandreou (where he was the only Balkan head of state in attendance), with a family holiday and a little business-negotiations over the buying of a tycoon's motor-yacht. 
Most Greeks seem quite happy with this steamy embrace of Serb luminaries. Indeed, Greece's defence minister, Gerasimos Arsenis, has said (though he later denied the remark) that he favours an amnesty for ex-Yugoslavs accused of war crimes. Greek coverage of Bosnia continues, across the political spectrum, to be unremittingly pro-Serb. The few Greek correspondents in the war zone covered events almost exclusively from Pale (the Bosnian Serb headquarters) and the Serbian capital Belgrade, while studiously avoiding mainly Muslim spots in Bosnia such as Sarajevo or Gorazde. This month's gruesome evidence of massacres of Muslims last year, in the Bosnian enclave of Srebrenica, earned scant mention in the Greek press, while the town's fall last year, and the horrors surrounding it, were covered at the time with an astonishing lack of detail.

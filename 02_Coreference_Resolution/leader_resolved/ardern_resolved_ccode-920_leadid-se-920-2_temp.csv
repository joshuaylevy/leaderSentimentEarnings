WHEN two Australian Greens senators left parliament last month after learning that they were dual citizens, and thus in breach of the constitution, Malcolm Turnbull, the prime minister, condemned their ""incredible sloppiness"". But on August 14th Barnaby Joyce, the deputy prime minister, revealed that he, too, was a citizen of two countries: Australia and New Zealand. His confession sparked a rare diplomatic row between the two countries. It also casts doubt on the survival of Mr Turnbull's government, which clings to power with a majority of one. 
Australia's constitution bans from the federal parliament anyone who is under ""acknowledgment of allegiance, obedience or adherence to a foreign power"", or who is ""a subject or a citizen or entitled to the rights or privileges of a subject or a citizen of a foreign power"". But in a country of high immigration, these strictures are causing unexpected political turmoil. In mid-July, Scott Ludlam of the Australian Greens resigned from the upper house, having just discovered he was a citizen of New Zealand. He left New Zealand when he was three, but never thought ""citizenship sticks to you in that way"". A few days later Larissa Waters, the other deputy leader of the party, tearfully announced her resignation. She had been born in Canada and moved to Australia as a baby, but had never renounced her Canadian citizenship. 
The circumstances of Matt Canavan, the former minister for resources, are even odder. The government was shaken when he declared on July 25th that he was both Italian and Australian. His mother, born in Australia to Italian parents, had secured Italian citizenship for herself and her son 11 years earlier. Mr Canavan says that he discovered this only when the citizenship row first erupted. 
Mr Canavan gave up his ministerial post, but not his Senate seat. Mr Joyce, a fellow member of the National Party, the junior coalition partner, took over his portfolio. Just three weeks later, though, Mr Joyce told parliament he was ""shocked"" to learn that he was a Kiwi because his father had been born in New Zealand before moving to Australia in 1947. 
Mr Joyce has a habit of highlighting his rural roots by wearing cowboy hats and giving whip-cracking displays. He is famous for playing the indignant patriot in a row over quarantine laws with Johnny Depp, a Hollywood actor. The opposition is revelling in his predicament, especially as the government would lose its majority if he had to quit. 
The dual-citizenship question has added fuel to Australia's already combustible politics. And the revelation that a staff member for a Labor senator had asked a New Zealand Labour MP about his country's citizenship rules before Mr Joyce's confession has turned the row into an international incident. Julie Bishop, Australia's foreign minister, accused New Zealand's Labour opposition of being ""involved in allegations designed to undermine the government of Australia"". Not so, retorted Jacinda Ardern, New Zealand's opposition leader. Undaunted, Mr Turnbull charged Australia's opposition of conspiring ""with a foreign power"". 
If this was a ploy to deflect embarrassment over Mr Joyce, it fell flat. It could damage trans-Tasman relations if Ms Ardern's party wins the general election due next month. And it ignores mounting calls to reform parliamentary citizenship rules drawn up in the 1890s, when Australia was still a colony of British subjects. The latest census, in 2016, revealed that 26% of Australians were born overseas; more than 300 languages are now spoken. 
On August 24th the High Court is due to start considering the case of the many dual-citizen MPs. Six have admitted doubts about their status; others have denied claims that they hold two nationalities. Mr Joyce has hurriedly renounced his New Zealand citizenship. Mr Turnbull argues he is qualified to stay in parliament ""and the High Court will so hold"". A rash claim, say some constitutional experts. George Williams, of the University of New South Wales, thinks all five politicians could be ""in great difficulty"" if they were dual citizens when first elected. There will be growing pressure to change the constitution. But any reform may come too late to help the beleaguered Mr Turnbull.","A row over who is eligible for parliament rattles the government

WHEN Jacinda Ardern was elected deputy leader of the Labour Party in March, she was unknown to most New Zealanders. The soft-left party was favoured by less than a quarter of voters when her uninspiring boss, Andrew Little, resigned last month, thrusting her into what she described as ""the worst job in politics"". The change was akin to ""anointing a prophet"", notes Raymond Miller, a professor at the University of Auckland. Labour has staged an unprecedented resurgence, climbing by as much as 20 points in some polls. That has cast doubt on the outcome of an election on September 23rd which had previously seemed certain to provide the right-of-centre National Party with another term in government. 
The local press calls it ""Jacindamania"". At the tender age of 37, Ms Ardern has harnessed what she calls a ""mood for change"". Not all locals have benefited from the strength of New Zealand's economy. Wages are stagnant and the price of housing has soared, feeding a debate about New Zealand's high levels of immigration. A record 71,000 more people arrived in New Zealand last year than left, partly because Kiwis who had left the country have been lured home by a stronger economy. Inadequate investment in housing has exacerbated the problem: New Zealand needs 60,000 new homes. The government spends NZ$140,000 ($100,000) a day accommodating the homeless. 
Unusually for a left-leaning leader, Ms Ardern has put immigration at the heart of her campaign, proposing to cut net arrivals by up to 30,000 annually. Labour also plans to ban non-resident foreigners from buying homes, arguing that it is wrong that American tech billionaires and Chinese investors can snap up houses and leave them empty amid such a shortage. (The Nationals, in contrast, say curbing immigration would hurt the economy.) 
But Ms Ardern rejects the idea that she is trying to stir up or harness hostility towards immigrants. If the government had responded faster to the housing crisis, she says, ""we would not be having this conversation."" Labour also wants to double New Zealand's intake of refugees. Her real target, she says, is the high cost of living: ""I want everyone who chooses to call New Zealand home to have a decent start."" To that end, she also promised to abolish tuition fees for university students. 
Yet personality, as much as policy, has underscored Labour's resurgence. Her sudden ascendancy has left Ms Ardern with ""no time to be anyone other than me"", and many voters are enthralled. Critics point to her youth and relative inexperience: she has been a member of parliament for nine years, but only in opposition. Yet others see energy and a breath of fresh air. Those who have worked with her say she is dedicated and considerate. Her campaign has been characterised by a rare brand of what she calls ""relentless positivity"". Posters of her beaming face are emblazoned with the slogan: ""Let's do this!"" 
In charm and charisma, Mr English, who took over the top job when his predecessor resigned last year, is eclipsed. During a previous stint as leader of the Nationals in 2002, he presided over a crippling defeat. Yet he has a reputation for credibility. During his eight years as finance minister unemployment fell, the budget returned to a surplus and New Zealand enjoyed one of the highest growth rates in the rich world. Ms Ardern, by contrast, has never championed a weighty bill or served as a minister. Some of her crowd-pleasing goals, like eradicating child poverty, seem unlikely to be met. In other areas she is accused of being uncomfortably vague. ""You can't replace a tunnel with a vision,"" the prime minister scolded her during a debate about infrastructure. 
In the face of this unexpected opposition, Mr English has made late promises to increase spending on roads and housing. He is favoured by farmers who have thrived on Chinese demand for New Zealand's milk. Kiwis may ultimately plump for his tried-and-tested approach. That would make the election memorable for stability, rather than a shake-up: another victory would give the Nationals the longest stint in government for any party in almost 50 years.","Jacinda Ardern shakes up an otherwise staid campaign

BILL ENGLISH, New Zealand's prime minister, looked every inch the victor after the election on September 23rd. ""We got better and better,"" he crowed as the count rolled in. ""No one expected that just three weeks ago."" His centre-right National party won 46% of the vote, putting it ten percentage points ahead of its main rival, Labour, with which some polls had suggested it was neck-and-neck. The result was remarkable not only because Mr English fended off Labour's telegenic new leader, Jacinda Ardern. It is also striking because, after almost a decade in power and despite a change in leadership, the Nationals seem as strong as ever. 
Celebrations, however, are premature. Any leader who can command a majority in the 120-seat parliament may form a government. The Nationals have fallen just short, with 58 seats, but could easily get over the line by allying with the populists of New Zealand First, who won nine seats and 7.5% of the vote (see chart). The prime minister says that his party has the ""moral authority"" to begin a fourth term, yet Labour has not conceded defeat because it could theoretically stitch together a tenuous trifecta with New Zealand First and the Greens. Winston Peters, the leader of New Zealand First, lost his constituency but will remain in parliament thanks to New Zealand's system of proportional representation. He now holds the balance of power. 
Mr Peters, who wants to ban foreign investment and give politicians free rein to meddle at the central bank, says he will not rush into ""premature"" decisions. When asked how long his negotiations might take, he threatened to throw a reporter into the ocean (they lasted two months the previous time he was kingmaker, in 1996). There is good reason to think that he will eventually walk up the aisle with Mr English, even though his campaign slogan this year was ""Had enough?"" Although it is not a requirement, the largest party has always formed the government. The economy has done well under the Nationals. And voters might see a coalition with Labour as overturning the results of the election, given the size of the Nationals' lead. 
Ms Ardern, however, maintains that over half of New Zealanders ""voted against the status quo"". Labour gained 13 seats while the Nationals lost two. She says she still has a good chance of becoming prime minister. New Zealand First has more in common with Labour, which wants to cut immigration and prevent foreigners who do not live in New Zealand from buying homes. It has labelled the Nationals' free-market reforms as a ""failed economic experiment"". 
Mr Peters has also feuded with bigwigs in the Nationals such as Steven Joyce, the finance minister. He might expect to hold greater sway over Ms Ardern, who needs him more, than over Mr English. And his two previous tie-ups with incumbents were followed by heavy losses for New Zealand First, notes Matthew Hooton, a political analyst, so it may be ""in his interest to side with someone new"". A similar logic might prompt Mr Peters, who is 72 and has already served as deputy prime minister, to refuse to join any coalition. 
Another factor complicating coalition-building is that the election results have not been finalised. The ballots of 380,000 people who were either late to register, needed help voting or live abroad have yet to be counted. These have tended to skew towards Labour and the Greens in the past, and may yet result in a seat or two being added to either party's tally. The final count will not be known until October 7th.

President Xi Jinping spoke of a ""new era"" unfolding in China that would result, by 2050, in the country becoming ""prosperous, strong, democratic, culturally advanced, harmonious and beautiful"". (He was using the word ""democratic"" in a way not found in any dictionary.) Mr Xi was speaking at the start of a five-yearly congress of the ruling Communist Party that will result in sweeping changes to the leadership, while leaving Mr Xi firmly in charge.

In Afghanistan, the Taliban claimed responsibility for a series of attacks that mostly targeted the police and killed at least 74 people, including one police chief. The worst ambush was in Gardez, where people queuing for passports were caught in the attack. 
New Zealand has a new government. Following last month's elections, the Labour Party will form a coalition with New Zealand First, a populist party, with support from the Greens. The prime minister will be 37-year-old Jacinda Ardern.

Mexico's attorney-general, Raul Cervantes, resigned amid accusations of shielding corrupt politicians from prosecution and failing to curb a surging murder rate. There have been calls in Mexico to create a chief prosecutor who is not appointed by the president. 
Police in Argentina found what may be the remains of Santiago Maldonado, an activist whose disappearance during a protest two months ago has embarrassed President Mauricio Macri's government on the eve of legislative elections on October 22nd. 
Colombia's constitutional court ruled that a peace deal signed last year with FARC rebels cannot be modified for 12 years. That prevents the next three governments from cancelling or changing the agreement, including its controversial provisions under which guerrillas who confess to crimes are treated leniently. 
The improbable victory of President Nicolas Maduro's United Socialist Party in 18 out of 23 governors' elections in Venezuela divided the opposition. Some winning opposition candidates accepted the results. Mr Maduro, who has defied protests and sanctions by concentrating power in a sham parliament, said the elections sent a ""strong message to imperialism"". 
The nuclear option 
Donald Trump backed off from his promise to scrap the deal that freezes Iran's nuclear programme. Mr Trump stopped short of the most drastic step: declaring Iran in breach of the multinational agreement. Instead he declined to certify to Congress, as American law demands, that the risks and benefits of sanctions relief are proportionate. That passes the buck to Congress to decide whether to impose new penalties on Iran. 
Two federal judges issued a temporary block on the Trump administration's third attempt at a travel ban on citizens from some Muslim countries. 
Already criticised for dawdling in offering condolences to the families of four American troops killed in Niger, Mr Trump became embroiled in a quarrel centred on one of the grieving widows. A Democratic congresswoman who was with the widow when Mr Trump made his phone call said that the president remarked that her husband ""knew what he was signing up for, but I guess it still hurt"". Mr Trump said this was a lie, and that he had proof.",920,New Zealand,se-920-2,,False,,0,True

JACINDA ARDERN looked a touch less assured than usual when she took to the stage on October 19th after becoming New Zealand's prime-minister designate. The 37-year-old had raised Labour from the dead after assuming leadership of it in August, but the centre-left party had still finished second in last month's general election with just under 37% of the vote. She had managed to secure leadership of the country by turning her charm on the populists of New Zealand First, convincing them to side with her instead of the winning centre-right National Party. With support from the Greens (who are not part of the coalition), Ms Ardern has created the first government of losing parties in New Zealand's proportionally representative parliament. On October 26th she was sworn in as the world's youngest female leader. 
Ms Ardern's promises of change resonated with many young New Zealanders. They were tired of the National Party, which had led the country for nearly a decade. But some commentators fret that change may involve a shift towards greater protectionism and an end to three decades of liberal economic reform. The populists and Labour have agreed to cut annual net migration by up to 30,000 people; to strengthen controls on the foreign purchase of farmland; and to renegotiate the Trans-Pacific Partnership, a now-sputtering regional plan for free trade, to curb house-buying by foreigners. The New Zealand dollar took a hit when Winston Peters, the populists' leader, said he had chosen to side with Labour because ""too many New Zealanders have come to view today's capitalism not as their friend, but as their foe."" 
It is true that some locals have felt left behind during a period of strong economic growth but near-stagnant wages. And although most New Zealanders say they are proud of their country's multicultural mix, a few take umbrage at an upsurge of immigration: annual net migration (new arrivals minus departing locals) has risen to over 70,000 in the country of fewer than 5m people, 16 times as many as in 2008. Many fret about the impact of this on house prices. They also complain that treasured national parks are increasingly jammed by overseas visitors. 
Ms Ardern strongly rejects allegations of stoking anti-immigration sentiment. Her party says it only aims to curb an influx of low-skilled migrants. Her populist partners will support her efforts to do so. For backing Labour, they have been rewarded with four seats in the cabinet. Mr Peters has accepted jobs as deputy prime minister and foreign minister. He has held both roles before, in coalitions both with Labour and with the National Party. 
The previous prime minister, Bill English, is now the leader of the opposition. Having secured 44% of the vote, his National Party will be a powerful challenger to a government whose ministers have little experience: few members of Ms Ardern's cabinet have previously held such rank (one is Mr Peters). Moreover, the coalition is weak: the Greens and New Zealand First could not bring themselves to speak to each other during talks to establish the alliance. Ms Ardern has made lofty promises to build 100,000 houses, reduce child poverty and clean up polluted rivers. That will be tough while trying to prevent feuding between her partners. She has shown her powers of persuasion by wooing voters and cobbling together a majority. A far greater challenge lies ahead.","Jacinda Ardern comes to power with promises of change

NICK SMITH may be the first politician to be immortalised in horse manure. Before the recent general election, a super-sized sculpture depicting the environment minister, trousers down, squatting over a glass, was paraded through central Christchurch. It was carved from dung in protest at an alarming increase in water pollution. Data published in 2013 suggested that it was not safe for people to submerge themselves in 60% of New Zealand's waterways. ""We used to swim in these rivers,"" says Sam Mahon, the artist. ""Now they've turned to crap."" 
Mr Smith's National Party is now out of government. But the real villains behind New Zealand's deteriorating water quality are still at large: cows. Scrub where sheep once grazed is being given over to intensive dairy farms--some of them irrigated to help the pasture grow. Some 6.6m cattle are now squeezed into the country of 4.7m people, transforming even an iconic arid grassland, the Mackenzie Basin (made famous by the ""Lord of the Rings"" films), into a tapestry of emerald fields. 
The first concern is bovine urine, which is rich in nitrogen. Nitrogen can cause toxic algae to grow when it leaches into water. Nitrogen fertiliser, used to increase fodder yields so that more cows can be raised on less land, exacerbates the problem. 
At many of the sites where the government tests the groundwater it contains too much nitrate to be safe to drink--a particular problem in New Zealand, since water in much of the country has long been considered clean enough that it is used as drinking water with only minimal treatment. In Canterbury, one of the most polluted areas, expectant mothers are told to test tap water to avoid ""blue baby syndrome"", a potentially fatal ailment thought to be caused by nitrates. The poisonous blooms have killed dogs. 
An even greater concern for human health comes from cow dung, which contains nasty bacteria such as E.coli. Three people died last year after a well was contaminated with another bug called campylobacter. Sheep were to blame in that case, yet cows have a proclivity for wading in rivers and their faeces often find their way into water. New Zealanders are twice as likely to fall ill from campylobacter as Britons, and three times more than Australians or Canadians. 
And then there is the damage to native flora and fauna. The algal blooms suck the oxygen from rivers. Sediment washed from farmland can also choke the life out of streams. Almost three-quarters of native species of freshwater fish are under threat. 
New Zealand is a rainy place, but farmers are also criticised for causing rivers to shrivel and groundwater to fall in certain overburdened spots. One recent tally suggested that just 2,000 of the thirstiest dairies suck up as much water as 60m people would--equivalent to the population of London, New York, Tokyo, Los Angeles and Rio de Janeiro combined. Most is hosed on the stony Canterbury region, including the Mackenzie Basin. Earlier this year locals were forced to rescue fish and eels from puddles which formerly constituted the Selwyn river, after drought and over-exploitation caused long stretches to dry up. 
Dairies are trying to clean up their act. Farmers have fenced off thousands of kilometres of rivers to prevent livestock from wading in. Some have planted trees along waterways to curb erosion; others remove animals from muddy fields during winter. Some parts of the country are using more sophisticated techniques: around Lake Taupo, the country's biggest lake, farmers can buy and sell nitrogen allowances in a cap-and-trade scheme. A technique called ""precision irrigation"" may curb both water consumption and the leaching of nitrogen. 
Earlier this year the National Party launched a plan to make 90% of rivers ""swimmable"" by 2040. Yet it ignored several recommendations of a forum of scientists and agrarians established to thrash out water policy, and removed elected officials from an environmental council in Canterbury after they attempted to curb the spread of irrigation. One of its big initiatives to improve water quality involved lowering pollution standards, making rivers look much cleaner at a stroke. 
The Labour Party, now in government, had promised during the election campaign to tax irrigators and use the cash to clean up rivers. But Labour's populist coalition partner disliked the idea, so it has been dropped. Jacinda Ardern, the new prime minister, says that she will charge companies that bottle and export local water--little more than a gesture, as they account for only a tiny share of water use. 
Environmentalists argue that the national dairy herd should be cut to prevent further damage. That may not be as hard on farmers as it sounds, argues Jan Wright, a former parliamentary commissioner for the environment. She says recent growth in the industry has been relatively inefficient, denting margins. Yet the chances of change are slim. The regulations governing Fonterra, a big dairy co-operative, encourage volume more than value, says Kevin Hackwell of Forest & Bird, a pressure group. And pollutants moving through groundwater can take decades to emerge in lakes. The worst may still be to come.

Donald Trump signed an executive order allowing the children of illegal immigrants to stay with their parents in detention centres if caught crossing the Mexican border. Previously, under the White House's ""zero-tolerance"" policy for illicit border-crossing, there had been a sharp rise in families being forcibly split up. Pictures of tearful children torn from their parents provoked an outcry, though a poll found that a small majority of Republicans supported the policy. Amnesty International said officials had intentionally inflicted ""severe mental suffering"" on the migrants.
The director of the fbi, Christopher Wray, said his agency would not repeat the mistakes uncovered in a report by the Justice Department's internal watchdog, which criticised the handling of investigations into Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump during the election in 2016. Among other things, it found thatJames Comey, then the fbi chief, had broken policy by making the investigation into Mrs Clinton's e-mail server public, but that he had not acted with political bias.
Paul Manafort, Mr Trump's former campaign manager, was sent to jail by a judge after he allegedly tried to sway the testimony of two witnesses at his forthcoming trail on a range of charges, which include money-laundering. He had been on bail ahead of the trial.
America withdrew from the un Human Rights Council, a body that includes China, Cuba, the Democratic Republic of Congo and other paragons of virtue.

If at first you don't succeed
New talks were held to try to end South Sudan's five-year civil war. It is the first time the two key leaders in the conflict have met in two years. All previous attempts to broker a peace deal have failed.
Israeli jets struck25 targets in Gaza linked to Hamas. The strikes were in response to almost 50 projectiles fired at Israel, said the Israeli military.
The un said that war crimes were committed by forces loyal to the regime of Bashar al-Assad in the Eastern Ghouta region of Syria. The un is still investigating whether chemical weapons were used in an attack on rebels in Douma.
The World Health Organisation said that the Ebola outbreak in the Democratic Republic of Congo has largely been contained, but officials warned against complacency.
Hello Duque
Iván Duque, a conservative who opposes parts of the peace agreement between Colombia's government and the farc guerrilla group, won the country's presidential election. He took 54% of the vote in a run-off, defeating Gustavo Petro, a far-left former mayor ofBogotá.
Masaya, a town near Managua, Nicaragua's capital, declared that it no longer recognises the presidency of Daniel Ortega and will govern itself. At least three people were killed in an operation to regain control of the town. More than 170 people have died in protests since April. Mediators from the Catholic church suspended negotiations between the government and the opposition because the government refused to allow foreign human-rights observers into the country.
Canada's parliament voted to legalise the recreational use of cannabis. The law regulates its cultivation, sets limits on possession and prohibits marketing that would encourage consumption. When it takes effect in October, Canada will be the second country in the world, after Uruguay, to make it legal to puff marijuana for pleasure.
Europe's critical point
A political crisis rocked Germany. The alliance between Angela Merkel's Christian Democrats and its more conservative Bavarian sister party, the csu, looked as if it might break down over how to handle migrants. Mrs Merkel seems to have won two more weeks to solve the problem.
Italy's interior minister, Matteo Salvini, called for a census of Roma. He threatened to deport Roma who are not Italian citizens, but said that ""unfortunately"" those Roma who were Italian would be allowed to stay.
The Hungarian parliament passed a law that would send anyone who helps illegal immigrants, including lawyers who assist asylum-seekers, to prison for a year. The nationalist government calls migrants a security threat. There are hardly any of them in Hungary, but many passed through on their way to Germany in 2015.
The British government fended off another attempt by Remainers to ensure that mps have the final decision should the Brexit talks end with no deal. The government won a vote in Parliament by 319 to 303 votes after giving further assurances that mps would have a ""meaningful vote"". One Tory Remainer said that meant a ""real say"". Brexiteers said nothing had changed and mps would get no say.

India's ruling Hindunationalist Bharatiya Janata Party pulled out of an alliance with the People's Democratic Party in Kashmir, prompting the state government to collapse. Kashmir's governor, who is appointed by the bjpled central government, will assume control of the state. Separately, unknown attackers murdered Shujaat Bukhari, one of Kashmir's most respected journalists.
New Zealand's prime minister, Jacinda Ardern, has given birth to her first child, a baby girl. She will now take six weeks of maternity leave, during which her duties will be performed by the deputy prime minister. She is only the second elected leader in modern history to give birth in office. The first was Benazir Bhutto, a prime minister of Pakistan, in 1990.
Kim Jong Un's makeover continued with a two-day visit to China, where the North Korean dictator was hailed as a leader trying to develop his impoverished nation. Mr Kim, who keeps babies in prison camps and has had members of his own family killed, attended a banquet hosted by Xi Jinping, China's president. The pair discussed Mr Kim's recent summit with Donald Trump, which was held in Singapore.
Business
The prospect of an all-out trade war between America and China became real. Donald Trump said he would impose tariffs on $50bn of Chinese goods, because Beijing was not dealing with American complaints about stealing intellectual property. China responded in kind by announcing penalties on $50bn of American goods, which prompted Mr Trump to threaten to levy additional tariffs on goods worth $400bn.
Taking the war seriously
Global stockmarkets took fright at the trade news, none more so than in China. The Shanghai Composite fell by 4% in a day to its lowest level in 20 months. The Shenzhen Composite dropped by 6%. Yi Gang, the governor of the People's Bank of China, said investors should ""stay calm and rational"". The central bank pumped 200bn yuan ($31bn) into financial institutions, followed by a smaller intervention, to ensure they remain liquid.
Oil prices swung up and down in part because of China's plan to target tariffs at American energy supplies. Investors were also jittery ahead of an opec meeting on June 22nd to discuss whether to increase oil production after an 18-month freeze in output.
Germany's central bank cut its forecast of the country's economic growth rate this year to 2%, from 2.5%. The Bundesbank thinks the ""external environment"" is driving up uncertainty in the German economy.
Mario Draghi hinted that the European Central Bank could restart its bond-buying programme if economic conditions deteriorate, just days after the bank announced that it would phase out its purchasing of assets. The ecb's president emphasised thatinterest rates would remain ultra-low until at least September 2019. The ecb is to halve the amount of assets it buys each month to €i5bn ($i7bn) from this September and will end all purchases in December.
msci, a company that designs stockmarket indices, said that Argentina would return to its emerging-market index in 2019 after an absence of ten years. That should lower the country's borrowing costs and increase investment in its stock and bond markets, a boost for Argentina, which is battling a run on the peso and has had to turn to the imf for help. Saudi Arabia will also be added to the msci emerging-market index for the first time.
Chasing the Fox
Disney raised its bid for the bulk of 21st Century Fox's assets to $7ibn, almost half of which is in cash and the rest in shares. That tops an unsolicited rival all-cash offer of $65bn from Comcast.
The White House announced that Kathy Kraninger would be nominated to head the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, a bugbear for Republicans ever since its creation as part of the DoddFrank reforms. The agency is being led by Mick Mulvaney, who is also the head of the White House budget office, where Ms Kraninger currently works. Some (mostly Democrats) questioned Ms Kraninger's appointment, claiming that-as a White House insider-she lacks the experience to run an independent office.
The flow of European venture capital hit its highest level for a decade last year, according to Invest Europe, a trade association for the industry. Of the €6.4bn ($7.2bn) in investments, 45% went to information and communications startups and 23% to biotech and health care.
In the biggest banking merger in Britain in a decade, cybg, the owner of Clydesdale and Yorkshire banks, agreed to pay ?l.7bn ($2.3bn) for Virgin Money. The deal creates Britain's sixth-largest bank.
Ford and Volkswagen said that they were talking about a ""strategic alliance"" which could see them develop commercial vehicles together. Ford also unveiled plans to create a hub for electric and autonomous cars, technologies where it has lagged behind its rivals.
Rupert Stadler, the chief executive of Audi, Volkswagen's luxury brand, was sent to jail in Germany while a judge looked into allegations that he might try to interfere with an investigation into vw's emissions cheating. He is the most senior executive at the vw group to have been arrested over the scandal.
Down and out
General Electric was booted out of the Dow Jones Industrial Average. The company had been on the index of 30 share prices continuously since 1907 and was one of its original components in 1896. It is replaced by Walgreens Boots, a pharmacy chain. ge was the most valuable American company in 2000, but its share price has halved over the past year owing to a difficult restructuring process.

 The British government fended off another attempt by Remainers to ensure that mps have the final decision should the Brexit talks end with no deal . The government won a vote in Parliament by 319 to 303 votes after giving further assurances that mps would have a "" meaningful vote "" . One Tory Remainer said that meant a "" real say "" . Brexiteers said nothing had changed and mps would get no say . 
 Mounting trouble 
 India 's ruling Hindunationalist Bharatiya Janata Party pulled out of an alliance with the People 's Democratic Party in Kashmir , prompting the state government to collapse . Kashmir 's governor , who is appointed by the bjpled central government , will assume control of the state . Separately , unknown attackers murdered Shujaat Bukhari , one of Kashmir 's most respected journalists . 
 Jacinda Ardern's , has given birth to Jacinda Ardern's first child , a baby girl . Jacinda Ardern will now take six weeks of maternity leave , during which Jacinda Ardern's duties will be performed by the deputy prime minister . Jacinda Ardern is only the second elected leader in modern history to give birth in office . The first was Benazir Bhutto , a prime minister of Pakistan , in 1990 . 
 Kim Jong Un 's makeover continued with a two - day visit to China , where the North Korean dictator was hailed as a leader trying to develop his impoverished nation . Mr Kim , who keeps babies in prison camps and has had members of his own family killed , attended a banquet hosted by Xi Jinping , China 's president . The pair discussed Mr Kim 's recent summit with Donald Trump , which was held in Singapore . 
 Business 
 The prospect of an all - out trade war between America and China became real . Donald Trump said he would impose tariffs on $ 50bn of Chinese goods , because Beijing was not dealing with American complaints about stealing intellectual property . China responded in kind by announcing penalties on $ 50bn of American goods , which prompted Mr Trump to threaten to levy additional tariffs on goods worth $ 400bn . 
 Taking the war seriously 
 Global stockmarkets took fright at the trade news , none more so than in China . The Shanghai Composite fell by 4 % in a day to its lowest level in 20 months . The Shenzhen Composite dropped by 6 % . Yi Gang , the governor of the People 's Bank of China , said investors should "" stay calm and rational "" . The central bank pumped 200bn yuan ( $ 31bn ) into financial institutions , followed by a smaller intervention , to ensure they remain liquid . 
 Oil prices swung up and down in part because of China 's plan to target tariffs at American energy supplies . Investors were also jittery ahead of an opec meeting on June 22nd to discuss whether to increase oil production after an 18 - month freeze in output . 
 Germany 's central bank cut its forecast of the country 's economic growth rate this year to 2 % , from 2.5 % . The Bundesbank thinks the "" external environment "" is driving up uncertainty in the German economy . 
 Mario Draghi hinted that the European Central Bank could restart its bond - buying programme if economic conditions deteriorate , just days after the bank announced that it would phase out its purchasing of assets . The ecb 's president emphasised thatinterest rates would remain ultra - low until at least September 2019 . The ecb is to halve the amount of assets it buys each month to € i5bn ( $ i7bn ) from this September and will end all purchases in December . 
 msci , a company that designs stockmarket indices , said that Argentina would return to its emerging - market index in 2019 after an absence of ten years . That should lower the country 's borrowing costs and increase investment in its stock and bond markets , a boost for Argentina , which is battling a run on the peso and has had to turn to the imf for help . Saudi Arabia will also be added to the msci emerging - market index for the first time . 
 Chasing the Fox 
 Disney raised its bid for the bulk of 21st Century Fox 's assets to $ 7ibn , almost half of which is in cash and the rest in shares . That tops an unsolicited rival all - cash offer of $ 65bn from Comcast . 
 The White House announced that Kathy Kraninger would be nominated to head the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau , a bugbear for Republicans ever since its creation as part of the DoddFrank reforms . The agency is being led by Mick Mulvaney , who is also the head of the White House budget office , where Ms Kraninger currently works . Some ( mostly Democrats ) questioned Ms Kraninger 's appointment , claiming that - as a White House insider - she lacks the experience to run an independent office . 
 The flow of European venture capital hit its highest level for a decade last year , according to Invest Europe , a trade association for the industry . Of the € 6.4bn ( $ 7.2bn ) in investments , 45 % went to information and communications startups and 23 % to biotech and health care . 
 In the biggest banking merger in Britain in a decade , cybg , the owner of Clydesdale and Yorkshire banks , agreed to pay ? l.7bn ( $ 2.3bn ) for Virgin Money . The deal creates Britain 's sixth - largest bank . 
 Ford and Volkswagen said that they were talking about a "" strategic alliance "" which could see them develop commercial vehicles together . Ford also unveiled plans to create a hub for electric and autonomous cars , technologies where it has lagged behind its rivals . 
 Rupert Stadler , the chief executive of Audi , Volkswagen 's luxury brand , was sent to jail in Germany while a judge looked into allegations that he might try to interfere with an investigation into vw 's emissions cheating . He is the most senior executive at the vw group to have been arrested over the scandal . 
 Down and out 
 General Electric was booted out of the Dow Jones Industrial Average . The company had been on the index of 30 share prices continuously since 1907 and was one of its original components in 1896 . It is replaced by Walgreens Boots , a pharmacy chain . ge was the most valuable American company in 2000 , but its share price has halved over the past year owing to a difficult restructuring process .

New Zealand bemoans Australia's deportation regime
NEW ZEALAND'S deputy prime minister, Winston Peters, knows how to stir the pot. In the midst of a diplomatic tiff with his country's biggest and usually chummiest neighbour, he suggested that Australia was in need of a new flag. Its current one, he complained, too closely ""copied"" New Zealand's. Since the two ensigns are so similar, Australia's should be the one to change. (Australia's flag was designed first, but was formally adopted a year later than New Zealand's, in 1903.) Mr Peters, who recently served as interim prime minister while Jacinda Ardern was on maternity leave, has a solution: an enormous kangaroo, ""like the maple leaf in Canada"".
The tiff is over Australia's increasing deportations of New Zealanders. In 2014 a conservative prime minister, Tony Abbott, tightened deportation rules. Any foreigner sentenced to a year in jail now fails a ""character test"" and has to leave the country. Kiwis may live and work freely in Australia. Since about 650,000 do so, the rule hits them the hardest. Since the law was changed, at least 1,200 New Zealanders have been cast back across the Tasman Sea. OzKiwi, an advocacy group, estimates that around 170 New Zealanders are currently in detention centres awaiting deportation, more than any other nationality.
Australia makes no concessions for those who came as children but never changed their passports. Neither does it for juvenile offenders, or petty criminals with short sentences that cumulatively add up to 12 months, even if those were suspended. Historic crimes were once ignored, but the law now works retroactively, counting ancient infringements committed overseas as well as recent ones in Australia.
Some prior offenders are stopped at airports. Australian authorities catch others, like Tommy Murray, a former biker, inside the country. He did four stints behind bars for crimes including drugs and burglary before moving to Australia. He says he lived law-abidingly for 16 years and paid A$1.2m ($890,000) in tax before his past caught up with him. In detention, he argues he was refused much-needed medication, then booted out without being able to see his family. ""My country treated him barbarically,"" says his Australian wife Sara, who followed him.
New Zealand politicians periodically grumble about Australian deportations, but the political mood between the two countries soured markedly when a 17-yearold was recently thrown into an adult detention centre in Melbourne. The deportations had ""a venal political strain"" to them, said New Zealand's justice minister, Andrew Little; Australia ""doesn't look like our best friend, our nearest neighbour."" Australia, Mr Peters added, was in breach of the un convention on children's rights.
The 17-year-old has since been released, but critics also raise questions about racial fairness. New Zealanders of Maori or Pacific Islander descent are disproportionately affected by the changes, because they are more likely than average to have convictions. About 60% of New Zealanders who have been deported from Australia since 2014 are ""brown"", as Joanne Cox of Oz Kiwi puts it. Citizenship is reserved mostly for the skilled and relatively wealthy: only about 8.4% of New Zealanders who arrived in Australia in the decade after 2001 got passports. The rate for Maoris was below 3%.
Paul Hamer, a researcher at Victoria University of Wellington, in New Zealand's capital, suggests that Australia's souring mood has been fed by ""dissatisfaction"" at New Zealand's openness to Pacific migration. It threw open its doors to the region at a time when Australia still banned all but white immigrants (today it sets annual quotas for newcomers from the Pacific). People of Pacific Islander descent are 8% of New Zealand's population. Politicians in Canberra, the Australian capital, have complained for decades that such migrants exploit a ""backdoor"" to Australia.
Its conservative coalition government under Malcolm Turnbull is so concerned about border control that last year it rebuffed New Zealand's offer to resettle asylum-seekers from detention centres run for Australia's benefit in Nauru, a tiny Pacific island state, and Manus island, part of Papua New Guinea. Almost 1,600 ""boat people"" remain in the controversial camps, with no idea of when they might be released. Australia's opposition leader, Bill Shorten, says he would reconsider the New Zealand proposal if his Labor party wins the general election that must be held in the coming year. But not, he adds, before dealing with the issue of their onward movement.","An Antipodean tiff

Hints that the Chinese government is meddling in politics cause a stir
We are free from political interference,"" protests New Zealand's prime minister, Jacinda Ardern. A scandal in the National Party, the main opposition, suggests otherwise. Last month an embittered National mp, Jami-Lee Ross, accused the party's leader, Simon Bridges, of breaking campaign-finance laws. He claims Mr Bridges deliberately disguised a donation of NZ$100,000 ($67,000) orchestrated by a businessman with links to the Chinese government. In a phone conversation that Mr Ross taped of him and Mr Bridges discussing the donation, neither makes any explicit reference to concealment. Mr Bridges calls Mr Ross's allegations ""baseless"". But whether the law was broken or not, the saga has stoked concerns about Chinese meddling.
Zhang Yikun, the man behind the donation, is a resident of New Zealand, but has held positions in several official Chinese organisations, according to Chen Weijian, a dissident journalist from China who also lives in New Zealand. Mr Ross's recording suggests the money was divided into smaller parcels, which meant it did not have to be declared. (Donations of less than NZ$15,000 can be kept anonymous, pro- vided the benefactor lives in the country.) But on the call Mr Ross also presented the donation as an amalgam of smaller gifts from associates of Mr Zhang. Police are investigating whether the donation was properly disclosed. Mr Ross, meanwhile, has been expelled from his party. Whatever the outcome, the row suggests munificence can win influence. In the call, Mr Ross and Mr Bridges discuss whether the party should respond by adding a business associate of Mr Zhang's to the list of mps appointed by the party under New Zealand's system of proportional representation.
This is not the first controversy surrounding Chinese interference. Last year it emerged that another conservative politician, Jian Yang, had worked for 15 years in Chinese military academies and been a member of the Communist Party before emigrating to New Zealand. He did not disclose this on his residency application, but denies being a spy and remains a member of parliament. China-born mps belonging to the governing Labour Party and the right-wing act have also been linked to organisations peddling China's agenda.
It is impossible to work out how many donations come with Chinese strings attached, because so many are made anonymously. Simon Chapple of Victoria University of Wellington calculates that the National Party received handouts worth NZ$4.5m in 2017. Three-quarters came from unnamed sources. At a fundraising auction in 2016 for Labour's Phil Goff, now the mayor of Auckland, New Zealand's biggest city, an anonymous bidder in China paid NZ$150,000 for a book written and signed by Xi Jinping, China's president.
Several former politicians have taken jobs with Chinese firms. The Chinese government keeps tabs on Chinese students at local universities and has co-opted most Chinese-language media. Last year AnneMarie Brady of the University of Canterbury alleged that a Chinese-owned dairy had been used to launch a scientific device that could help China develop long-range missiles. A report published recently by Canada's intelligence agency complains that New Zealand is a ""soft underbelly"" through which China might gain access to intelligence shared by America, Australia, Britain and Canada.
In Australia, similar scandals have prompted the passage of new laws aimed at crimping foreign influence. The Greens, part of New Zealand's ruling coalition, want to lower the threshold for anonymous donations to NZ$1,000 and outlaw gifts from foreigners. A petition calling for an inquiry on foreign influence has been lodged in parliament. Publicly, Ms Ardern maintains that New Zealand's laws are fine as they are. But her government does seem to be considering how to respond-without jeopardising trade with China. ?","China and New Zealand

Chinese tourists are a boon to many economies. They also give China clout
EARLIER THIS month the great pyramids of Giza and the nearby Sphinx were lit up in ""Chinese red"". Spectators, many of them from China, were then given another unprecedented treat. The sound-and-light show, a staple of pyramid entertainment since 1961, was narrated in Chinese.
The event was sponsored by the Chinese government, which takes pride in its travellers' growing influence. Since 2012 China has been the world's biggest source of tourists. Chinese travellers racked up nearly 150m trips abroad last year. Their spending-over $25obn in 2017-far outstrips that of their American counterparts (see chart on next page). Chinese officials know these tourists buy influence. Take Egypt, which China sees as a regional hub of its Belt and Road Initiative-an effort to boost its influence through massive spending on infrastructure. China's leg-up for the country's tourist industry is a way of showing thanks for Egypt's enthusiasm.
China even uses the term ""tourism diplomacy"". The Communist Party's mouthpiece, the People's Daily, says this has become an ""important and indispensable"" tool of China's foreign policy. And, just as Chinese tourism can win friends, so its curtailment can be used to show displeasure. Some analysts call this tactic ""weaponising"" outbound tourism. In countries where Chinese visitors play an important economic role, any twitch by China that may curb the flow soon spreads anxiety.
New Zealand (pictured) is one such country. Tourism is the country's biggest earner of foreign exchange. China is its second-biggest source of tourists after Australia. So the cancellation of a ceremony due to be held this week in Wellington to mark the launch of the China-New Zealand Year of Tourism understandably caused jitters. New Zealand cited ""changes of schedule on the Chinese side"", but speculation blamed China's pique with New Zealand for airing anxieties about the security of 5G technology made by Huawei, a Chinese firm.
An article published by Global Times, a tabloid controlled by the People's Daily, fuelled concerns in New Zealand that China's enthusiasm for the year of tourism was waning. The newspaper said ""tense political relations"" had ""sparked boycotts"" by potential Chinese visitors, quoting a Beijing resident as complaining: ""New Zealand stabbed US in the back but asks for our money? This is two-faced.""
China's resentment may subside. On February 19th New Zealand's prime minister, Jacinda Ardern, denied reports that her government had banned a company, Spark, from using Huawei equipment. She said no final decision on Huawei had been made. Global Times, for which poking foreigners in the eye is a business model, may have strayed from the government line. The overseas edition of the People's Daily had a very different message, reporting on February 15th that ""fervour"" among Chinese tourists for trips to New Zealand was ""continuously rising"". It referred to the launch of the year of tourism as ""upcoming"".
The Chinese government has never admitted it cuts tourist numbers to punish other countries. But it certainly does. Take Taiwan, where the numbers of visitors from China grew rapidly after the election in 2008 of a China-friendly president, Ma Ying-jeou. He was replaced in 2016 by a China-sceptic one, Tsai Ing-wen. The number of Chinese trips fell from nearly 4.2m in 2015 to about 2.7m last year. Direct or indirect government pressure on China's tour operators to reduce the number of package tours is the most likely cause.
After South Korea installed an American-owned missile-defence system, thaad, in 2017, that country also suffered a dramatic decline in visitors from China. By late last year restrictions appeared to be loosened. In 2018 there were nearly 5m visits by Chinese tourists, up from just over 4m in the previous year. The numbers are still far from pre-THAAD levels, however.
Japan and the Philippines have also suffered. In 2012, during anti-Japanese protests in China, the number of Chinese visitors to Japan fell sharply. By 2014, however, they were back again in record numbers. In 2012 some travel agencies suspended group tours to the Philippines during a standoff between that country and China in the South China Sea. No such trouble mars ties under the country's current China-friendly leader, Rodrigo Duterte. A year ago the Philippines said China had overtaken America to become its second-biggest source of tourists, after South Korea.
How much Chinese government meddling is responsible for falling numbers is often hard to gauge. Public patriotic sentiment, albeit whipped up by official rhetoric, may also be an important factor. Cautious travel agents in China proactively curtail trips to certain countries when they sense that the diplomatic mood is souring, says someone in the business.
Turkey is a case in point. It had been enjoying a Chinese-tourism boom owing, not least, to a reality-television show (featuring in this instance hot-air ballooning)-a fairly typical reason for a surge, say travel agents. On February 9th Turkey called China's gulag for ""re-educating"" Muslims in Xinjiang province a ""great shame for humanity"". China responded with a safety alert to Chinese travellers to Turkey, as it did recently for Canada, another country embroiled in a Huawei-related spat.
The tiny Pacific-island country of Palau provides refreshing evidence, however, of Chinese tourists' resilience to governmental tampering with their holidays. Their numbers in Palau rose from fewer than 650 in 2008 to more than 91,000 in 2015. Then they began to drop, partly, perhaps, because of official reminders to travel agencies that Palau, which recognises Taiwan, does not enjoy ""approved destination status""-a cachet that only China's diplomatic partners may enjoy. Yet many Chinese tourists seem happy to ignore that. The government can stop tour groups, but independent travel is far harder to curb. Last year about 50,200 Chinese still made it to Palau, despite the closure, for conservation reasons, of its wondrous Jellyfish Lake.","Outbound tourism

In 2012 some travel agencies suspended group tours to the Philippines during a standoff between that country and China in the South China Sea . No such trouble mars ties under the country 's current China - friendly leader , Rodrigo Duterte . A year ago the Philippines said China had overtaken America to become its second - biggest source of tourists , after South Korea . 
 How much Chinese government meddling is responsible for falling numbers is often hard to gauge . Public patriotic sentiment , albeit whipped up by official rhetoric , may also be an important factor . Cautious travel agents in China proactively curtail trips to certain countries when they sense that the diplomatic mood is souring , says someone in the business . 
 Turkey is a case in point . It had been enjoying a Chinese - tourism boom owing , not least , to a reality - television show ( featuring in this instance hot - air ballooning)-a fairly typical reason for a surge , say travel agents . On February 9th Turkey called China 's gulag for "" re - educating "" Muslims in Xinjiang province a "" great shame for humanity "" . China responded with a safety alert to Chinese travellers to Turkey , as it did recently for Canada , another country embroiled in a Huawei - related spat . 
 The tiny Pacific - island country of Palau provides refreshing evidence , however , of Chinese tourists ' resilience to governmental tampering with their holidays . Their numbers in Palau rose from fewer than 650 in 2008 to more than 91,000 in 2015 . Then they began to drop , partly , perhaps , because of official reminders to travel agencies that Palau , which recognises Taiwan , does not enjoy "" approved destination status""-a cachet that only China 's diplomatic partners may enjoy . Yet many Chinese tourists seem happy to ignore that . The government can stop tour groups , but independent travel is far harder to curb . Last year about 50,200 Chinese still made it to Palau , despite the closure , for conservation reasons , of its wondrous Jellyfish Lake .",920,New Zealand,se-920-2,IN TERM,True,"New Zealand 's prime minister , Jacinda Ardern ,",3,True

Violent white nationalists increasingly resemble the jihadists they hate. They should be treated the same
A FANATIC WALKED into a house of worship and opened fire. Men, women, children; he made no distinction. Brenton Tarrant showed no mercy because he did not see his victims as fully human. When he murdered 50 people, he did not see mothers, husbands, engineers or goalkeepers. He saw only the enemy.
The massacre in New Zealand on March 15th was a reminder of how similar white-nationalist and jihadist killers really are. Though the two groups detest each other, they share methods, morals and mindsets. They see their own group as under threat, and think this justifies extreme violence in ""self-defence"". They are often radicalised on social media, where they tap into a multinational subculture of resentment. Islamists share footage of atrocities against Muslims in Myanmar, Syria, Xinjiang and Abu Ghraib. White nationalists share tales of crimes against white people in New York, Rotherham and Bali. The alleged shooter in New Zealand, who is Australian, scrawled on a gun the name of an 11-year-old Swedish girl killed by a jihadist in 2017.
It takes a vast leap of illogic to conclude that the murder of a young girl in Stockholm justifies the murder of Muslim children 17,500km away. But when extremists meet in the dark corners of the web, they inspire each other to greater heights of paranoia and self-righteousness. Their enemies want to destroy their peo- ple and their faith. It is a fight for survival. Apparently unconnected outrages are part of a global plot which, after great contortion, both jihadists and neo-Nazis often blame on the Jews.
Worldwide, jihadists kill many more people than white supremacists do. However, in the West, white-nationalist violence is catching up with the jihadist variety and has in some places overtaken it (see International section). The numbers are hard to pin down, but there is cause for alarm. By one estimate, between 2009 and 2018 white supremacists killed more than three-quarters of the 313 people murdered by extremists in America. Farright networks with violent ambitions have been uncovered in the German army. The West has no white-nationalist equivalent of Islamic State, but plenty of angry racists there have access to guns. And recent events have fired them up. The Syrian refugee crisis, for example, created vivid images of Muslims surging into Europe, fuelling the fears of those who fret that non-whites are outbreeding whites and will one day ""replace"" them in their ancestral homelands.
Yet there is hope. Another reason the white racist threat looms relatively larger is that the West has grown better at thwarting the jihadist one. Since the attacks of September 11th 2001, security services have put huge efforts into infiltrating jihadist groups both in person and online, eavesdropping on their conversations and taking down their propaganda. Since jihadism crosses borders, intelligence services have also shared information and worked hand in hand to disrupt plots. Governments have strengthened the defences of obvious targets, starting with airline cockpits. They have foiled dozens of plots and jailed hundreds of jihadists. They have also worked to deradicalise extremists, or to prevent them from taking up arms.
All these methods should be used against violent white nationalists, too. More cash will be needed. It is absurd, for example, that America's Department of Homeland Security has no experts in far-right terrorism. But even with ample funds, the task will not be easy. People who post racist diatribes online often pretend that they are joking. Spotting potential killers among the much larger number of poison-pontificators is hard. So is finding the right people to deradicalise the far right. Would-be jihadists can sometimes be talked out of it by moderate imams, who ground their arguments in texts that both parties revere. This is trickier with neo-Nazis, but a mix of public ostracism and patient counselling can work.
Sensitivity is essential. Lots of non-violent people share at least some of the extremists' concerns, albeit in milder form. And just as the struggle against jihadism must be calibrated so as not to pick on peaceful Muslims-or create that sense-so the struggle against white extremism should avoid alienating peaceful whites who happen to oppose immigration or who occasionally say obnoxious things online.
It is an explosive problem, and one that would be easier to deal with if prominent politicians stopped throwing lighted matches at it. When President Donald Trump calls the flow of immigrants an ""invasion"", he lends cover to those who would repel them violently. Likewise Viktor Orban, Hungary's prime minister, when he claims that a Jewish billionaire is plotting to flood Europe with Muslim migrants in order to swamp its Christian culture. And so too Turkey's strongman, President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, when he says that the shooter in New Zealand is part of a grand plot against Turks. By contrast, New Zealand's prime minister, Jacinda Ardern, has struck the right note. She donned a headscarf, to show that an attack on Muslims is an attack on all New Zealanders. She is tightening the country's gun controls. She has shown how an assault on New Zealand's values of tolerance and openness is in fact a reason to strengthen them.","The Christchurch mosque massacre

""THIS ISN'T New Zealand"" has become a national refrain. After a white supremacist's attack on mosques in Christchurch, a shocked country is mourning the 50 worshippers he killed. Condolences are scrawled in chalk on pavements. White New Zealanders pull Muslim immigrants aside to apologise and Maoris dance hakas for the dead. Thousands have gathered for vigils. Florists have run out of stock. As for the prime minister, Jacinda Ardern, she has displayed leadership and compassion. Wearing a Muslim headscarf, she stresses that the whole country is on the side of the victims (many immigrants, some refugees) and their families. ""They,"" she says, ""are us."" The perpetrator of the violence most assuredly is not.
For under attack too was New Zealand's own image as a uniquely open and tolerant place. To many Kiwis it came as a relief that the alleged assailant grew up in that raw-edged place across the Tasman Sea, Australia. Ms Ardern has suggested that New Zealand was a target precisely because of its inclusiveness.
This image matters hugely to New Zealanders, and many newcomers quickly adopt it. One of the survivors in Christchurch was Yasif Hussein, who immigrated from Fiji four years ago. He describes lying on the ground, looking straight up into the assailant's face and thinking his end had come. Yet, having somehow survived, Mr Hussein says New Zealand has always ""felt like my own country"".
Like all national narratives, New Zealand's liberal one has a founding myth: the Treaty of Waitangi. Signed in 1840 with over 500 Maori chiefs, it established British sovereignty over New Zealand. Crucially, Britain acknowledged the landholdings of New Zealand's original, Polynesian settlers and guaranteed them rights as British subjects. Since the 1970s a tribunal has served to provide compensation for the many subsequent breaches of the treaty.
The treatment of Maoris stands in contrast to Australia's towards Aboriginals, who were once hunted like vermin. As recently as the 1970s children deemed to be mixed-race were forcibly removed into care. The first official apology to Australia's indigenous peoples came only in 2008. There has yet to be much compensation for historic wrongs beyond the return of some traditional Aboriginal land.
The treatment of Maoris, some say, gives a leg-up to other minorities too. Yet since the massacre, New Zealand's selfimage has come in for scrutiny. There are plenty of blemishes. After all, racial ideology long served as the basis of immigration policy, keeping non-whites out. As for the Maoris, ravaged by discrimination and imported disease, the task of the white settlers was, as one of them put it, to ""smooth the pillow of the dying race"".
These days you only have to visit rundown neighbourhoods inhabited by Maoris and other Pacific islanders to know that race relations are far from perfect. They are hotspots of unemployment, alcoholism and domestic violence. Many white New Zealanders blithely pass their lives in a parallel world.
Taika Waititi, a filmmaker and comedian, claimed last year that New Zealand remains ""racist as fuck"". Resentment over sharp increases in immigration, and even of Maori progress where it has taken place, has caused some among the white majority to think of themselves as victims. Not long ago Christchurch was notorious for its race-baiting skinheads. Today the radio waves are full of American-style shock jocks stoking resentment. Ms Ardern herself campaigned on curbing the immigration that was widely believed to be fuelling sharp rises in property prices. Michael Grimshaw of the University of Canterbury worries that if Brenton Tarrant, the man accused of the massacre, gets to air his grievances in court, ""that is how you get your 'Uncle Barry' listening."" And Uncle Barry may not agree with all of his complaints, but he might agree with some of them.
No country is all sweetness and light. What matters is the direction of travel. In America demagogues portray any trifling curb on gun ownership as a plot against whites. In New Zealand Ms Ardern has swung even the political right behind tighter gun control. In Australia a hardright senator implied that the Christchurch massacre was the fault of Muslims, who should not have migrated to New Zealand in the first place. In New Zealand's political discourse, such a comment is nearly inconceivable.

A solitary killer in Christchurch is part of a global movement
CHRISTCHURCH, ISTANBUL, MOSCOW AND WASHINGTON, DC
HE SEEMS to have been a classic ""lone wolf"". As far as police can tell, the man who murdered 50 worshippers, and critically wounded nine more, at two mosques in Christchurch, New Zealand on March 15th was not part of any organisation. The 28-year-old Australian, Brenton Tarrant, claimed to have developed his violent beliefs on his own, surfing the internet and visiting Europe. He bought his weapons himself. He honed his skills at a suburban shooting-range. No one there suspected that he was preparing a massacre.
Yet he was part of something much bigger. The names and slogans scrawled on his weapons were familiar to extreme white nationalists all around the world-but hardly anyone else. His ranting internet manifesto, ""The Great Replacement"", repeated a staple far-right conspiracy theory: that non-white and Muslim immigrants in Western countries are invaders, ushered in by scheming elites to replace ethnic-European populations. Variants of that once-fringe idea are now common, not just in social-media posts by anonymous wackos but in the speeches of elected politicians from Hungary to Iowa.
In another sense, too, the lone wolf had a pack. Attacks by neo-Nazis, white supremacists and other extreme-right types are growing more common. In America they outnumber those committed by Islamists. Of 263 domestic terrorism incidents in 2010-17, fully 92 were carried out by far-right attackers, compared with 38 by jihadists, according to an analysis of the Global Terrorism Database by the Washington Post. In Europe jihadist killings still predominate, but deaths from extremeright terrorism have surged since 2010 (see chart on next page).
The past six months have seen a rash of far-right terrorist incidents. Last autumn a white nationalist killed 11 people at a synagogue in Pittsburgh. France broke up a plot to kill Emmanuel Macron, the president, and Spain arrested a fascist hoping to assassinate Pedro Sánchez, the prime minister. Germany uncovered an extremist cell in the army, allegedly planning to kill the foreign minister and others. In February America's FBI arrested a Coast Guard officer who had an arsenal and a target-list of Democratic politicians.
Globally, white-nationalist terrorism is far less deadly than the jihadist variety. But it is more prevalent than authorities acknowledge, says Jacob Aasland Ravndal of Norway's Centre for Research on Extremism. Legal definitions of terrorism often require that an attack be planned in advance. Much extreme-right violence is spontaneous. Even burning down a refugee centre may count as a hate crime, not terrorism. Europol, the EU's law-enforcement agency, ascribed just 3% of terrorist attacks in 2017 to the far right. But Mr Ravndal's database of ideologically motivated violent incidents shows that in western Europe, though jihadists kill more people, the far right carry out more attacks.
More right than they know
If the threat from white nationalists is underestimated, that is partly because they are more publicity-shy. Mr Tarrant and his hero, Anders Breivik, who murdered 77 people in Norway in 2011, were exceptions. They left manifestos and tried to maximise media exposure. Indeed, the Christchurch killer also resembled sophisticated jihadist outfits, both in the ostentatious cruelty of his crime and in his hope that it would polarise society, fuelling yet more extremism.
Islamic State tries to provoke the West into persecuting Muslims and thus driving sympathisers from the ""grey zone"" towards radical participation. Right-wing extremists may also hope to provoke an Islamist backlash. Police are investigating a possible terrorist motive behind the murder of three people on a tram in Utrecht in the Netherlands, three days after the massacre in Christchurch. A Turkish-born suspect has been arrested.
In Turkey President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has seized on the attack in Christchurch as evidence of a broad conspiracy against Turkey and Islam. He has quoted from the killer's manifesto, which includes calls to expel Turks from Europe and to kill Mr Erdogan. The president's not-so-subtle message is that only he can protect Turks from rampant white nationalism.
The Christchurch killer also hoped to provoke stricter gun laws, so that gunowners would rise up in revolt. There is not much chance of more gun control in America, Mr Tarrant's primary target. However, Jacinda Ardern, New Zealand's prime minister, is moving to tighten her country's lax gun laws. This will not start a civil war. New Zealand prides itself on multiculturalism (see Banyan). Its politics are more moderate than Australia's.
That, along with its easy gun laws, may have been why Mr Tarrant picked New Zealand. He wrote that he wanted to prove that nowhere was safe. Muslims in Christchurch have lost all sense of security. Tofazzal Alam, who survived the attack, says he is now afraid ""to go to mosque, afraid of any crowd, afraid even to open the door"".
Yet the killer's manifesto was inspired by events far away in Europe. He claimed he was converted to radical-right ideology on a trip to France in 2017, when he saw how much of the population was Muslim. He decorated his flak jacket with a ""black sun"", a symbol traced to a floor motif used in his castle by Heinrich Himmler, a Nazi leader. He decorated his weapons with the names of victims of jihadist attacks in Stockholm and Paris. Before the shootings, he listened in his car to ""God is a Serb"", a song written in 1993 in support of Radovan Karadzic-a Bosnian Serb leader convicted of genocide for his role in the massacre of 8,000 Muslims at Srebrenica in 1995.
The idea that Muslims and non-whites are ""invaders"" imported by a cosmopolitan elite to replace ethnic Europeans has its roots in thinkers of the French ""new right"" of the 1970s, such as Alain de Benoist and Renaud Camus. It is often linked to the belief that multicultural societies, far from promoting diversity, extinguish it by mixing distinct cultures and races together. The nuttiest apostles of such notions equate immigration with genocide.
These ideas attracted the anti-Muslim populist politicians who sprung up across Europe around the turn of the millennium, especially after the September 11th attacks in America. They inspired the far-right youth network Generation Identity. But the big impetus came in 2015-16, when some 2m asylum-seekers, mostly from the Middle East, poured into Europe.
For right-wing populists, this crisis was a godsend. Viktor Orban, Hungary's prime minister, built a fence against the migrants and began calling himself a defender of Christian Europe. A frenzied opposition to Muslim immigration (real or imaginary) is the lodestar of populist-right parties in Germany, Poland, Sweden and Italy. At the European Parliament this month, Javier Ortega Smith of Vox, a new far-right Spanish party, thundered that had Spanish and Venetian fleets not won the battle of Lepanto against the Turks in 1571, every female mep ""would be wearing a burqa"".
Daniel Koehler of the German Institute on Radicalisation and De-radicalisation Studies says that it is no coincidence that extreme-right violence jumped during the migrant crisis, along with the fortunes of far-right parties: ""If you think you have ...to protect against 'invaders'-how do you do that without using force?""
In America, too, the rise in extremeright violence is linked to mainstream politics. Between 2009 and 2018, white supremacists killed more than three-quarters of the 313 people murdered by extremists. In 2016, the year Donald Trump won the presidency, more anti-Muslim assaults were reported to the FBI (127) than in any year since 2001(93).
Such attacks rose steeply after Barack Obama's election in 2008. Daryl Johnson, who spent 15 years studying right-wing terrorist groups, including at the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), wrote a paper in 2009 warning that the arrival that year of a black person in the White House could spark far-right violence. Demonised by conservatives for this, he left the DHS in 2010. Today, he says, it has no experts in right-wing terrorism. A spokesman did not deny this, but, in an email, said that the DHS is ""committed to combating all forms of violent extremism, especially those that espouse racial supremacy or bigotry"".
In denial
Mr Trump has played down the threat of right-wing extremists, calling them ""a small group of people that have very, very serious problems"". In 2017 his administration cancelled grants to groups combating white-supremacism. Peter Singer, a cybersecurity expert at the New America Foundation who was invited to speak to Mr Trump's national-security staff that year, said that they dismissed white-supremacist terrorism as ""a law-enforcement issue"", and denied that it is transnational.
In fact, the ties between American and European extreme-right groups are ever closer. Europe's Generation Identity groups are linked to Identity Evropa, one of the the American far-right organisations that planned a ""Unite the Right"" rally in Charlottesville, Virginia in 2017, where a white nationalist drove his car into a crowd and killed a counter-protester. Marchers at that rally chanted ""Jews will not replace us"", referring to the same ""great replacement"" thesis shared by European extremists and the Christchurch killer.
Mr Trump has played the role for American white nationalists that such leaders as Mr Orban played for Europe's, says Brian Levin, who heads the Centre for the Study of Hate and Extremism at California State University, San Bernardino. These groups, he says, saw their ideas, such as building a wall like Mr Orban's, and banning or deporting Muslims, ""getting into the mainstream tent"". They took this as a ""green light"" for violence. And he notes that, like the young on Europe's extremist right, they have softened their image in the past decade. Shaved heads and combat boots have given way to army haircuts, polo shirts and corduroy jackets.
Far-right groups lack the state sponsors and safe havens enjoyed by some jihadists. Many on the extreme right admire Russia but it does not fit the bill. It has cultivated ties with far-right parties in Europe, but has snuffed out extremists at home. In the 2000s hate-motivated attacks, often directed at immigrants and internal migrants from the north Caucasus, reached nearly 700 a year, as the state flirted with nationalist movements. Clashes in Moscow in 2011 between police and far-right groups mixed with football hooligans showed the dangers of tolerating the ultranationalists. After they joined anti-government protests in 2011-12, the state began shutting them down, detaining the most violent. In 2014 war with Ukraine split the movement into pro-government and proUkrainian factions. The sova Centre, an independent monitor, recorded just 57 hatemotivated attacks in 2018.
The Ukrainian model
Other Western white nationalists look to Ukraine itself, a hotbed of far-right activity since the Maidan uprising in 2014. Quasifascist militias, such as the Azov Battalion, have fought Russia in the east and taken a role in policing. So Kiev is ""a place of attraction for the global far-right"", says Anton Shekhovtsov, of the University of Vienna. Some European radicals have joined Ukrainians on the front lines. American white supremacists have been spotted in Kiev. But as Mr Shekhovtsov puts it, ""migration is a first-world problem"", and, whereas earlier far-right groups would beat up foreigners from Africa and Asia, Azov is keener on disrupting gay-pride marches. In any case, Ukrainian men seeking romantic violence have plenty to do in the east.
A more pressing concern for Western governments is far-right radicalism within their armed forces. Soldiers, obviously, are trained and have access to weapons. In America the DHS warned a decade ago that right-wing extremists will attempt to ""recruit and radicalise"" veterans, recalling the terrorist attacks of the 1990s by bitter exsoldiers, such as the Oklahoma City bombing. A study of 119 lone-actor terrorists across America and Europe since 1990 found that 26% had done military service.
Racial tension is rising in the armed services. A recent poll by Military Times, a newspaper, found that over half of nonwhite American service members had suffered racism in 2018, up from 42% in the previous year. In 2017 two marines were arrested for hanging a white-supremacist banner on a building in North Carolina. On March 18th the Huffington Post, a news website, identified seven serving American soldiers as active in Identity Evropa.
The German authorities are investigating some 450 cases of suspected right-wing extremism in the Bundeswehr. Last year the security services identified dozens of police and soldiers as members of Reichsbürger, a far-right movement. In Britain in September 2017 four soldiers were arrested for membership of National Action, a banned neo-Nazi group. ""If we get enough of us into the Army,"" suggested one, ""we'll be in the right place when things start to collapse.""
Armies are tightening their vetting procedures and becoming more vigilant. They insist that adherence to law is drilled into recruits. But, for good reason, most armed forces are prohibited from conducting political education.
Tracking sources of danger is hard because, as Mr Koehler, the German scholar, points out, far-right violence typically involves loose groups of individuals radicalised on social media. He calls this ""hive terrorism"". It is practically impossible to predict when someone will go from wishing others dead to actually killing them.
The Christchurch killer is a perfect example. He spent time on 8chan, a messageboard that prides itself on allowing users to post anything not illegal under American law. (After the attack, its administrators said they would co-operate with police.) It concerns itself with everything from Japanese cartoons to role-playing games. Anonymous posting is the norm.
The board's ""Politically Incorrect"" subsections are far-right haunts. Their culture is a self-consciously puerile mishmash of memes, absurdism and irony, making it hard to know how seriously to take anything posted there. When Mr Tarrant declared on 8chan that he was about to commit murder, and proceeded to live-stream it on Facebook, many replies expressed surprise (often pleased) that the promised shooting spree was actually happening.
The killer's manifesto, too, is steeped in 8chan-like irony, a style sometimes termed ""shitposting"". Serious rants about low European birth-rates alternate with claims to have been radicalised by ""Spyro the Dragon 3"", a children's video game. If the media took such claims seriously, they would prove their own cluelessness.
Since the attacks, there have been calls for internet platforms to do a better job of restricting violent right-wing content. Facebook has been blamed for letting the live-stream of the attack go on for 17 minutes. The platform says it began vigorously blocking the video as soon as it discovered it, removing 1.5m attempts to repost it. But internet users could still find copies hours after the attack. (It did not help that some ""mainstream"" media sites-and even Mr Erdogan-used some of it.)
Big internet platforms could do more, but they face a gargantuan task. The underlying problem, says Ben Nimmo of the Oxford Internet Institute, is that ""radicalising content is not constant""-one viewer's trigger to violence is another's harmless satire. Hopes that artificial intelligence might do much of the filtering have not worked out; armies of human reviewers are still needed, and even they often err.
However hard it is to stop terrorists exploiting the internet, other citizens can, at least, refuse to help them. The Christchurch killer's fixation on the former Yugoslavia is apt: as in that war, white nationalists seek to use spectacular violence and propaganda to turn citizens against each other. In New Zealand Ms Ardern has turned this on its head. She has tried to use horrific slaughter to unite a country in opposition to a creed whose most famous new exponent she refuses to name.","White nationalist terrorism 
 A solitary killer in Christchurch is part of a global movement 
 CHRISTCHURCH , ISTANBUL , MOSCOW AND WASHINGTON , DC 
 HE SEEMS to have been a classic "" lone wolf "" . As far as police can tell , the man who murdered 50 worshippers , and critically wounded nine more , at two mosques in Christchurch , New Zealand on March 15th was not part of any organisation . The 28 - year - old Australian , Brenton Tarrant , claimed to have developed his violent beliefs on his own , surfing the internet and visiting Europe . He bought his weapons himself . He honed his skills at a suburban shooting - range . No one there suspected that he was preparing a massacre . 
 Yet he was part of something much bigger . The names and slogans scrawled on his weapons were familiar to extreme white nationalists all around the world - but hardly anyone else . His ranting internet manifesto , "" The Great Replacement "" , repeated a staple far - right conspiracy theory : that non - white and Muslim immigrants in Western countries are invaders , ushered in by scheming elites to replace ethnic - European populations . Variants of that once - fringe idea are now common , not just in social - media posts by anonymous wackos but in the speeches of elected politicians from Hungary to Iowa . 
 In another sense , too , the lone wolf had a pack . Attacks by neo - Nazis , white supremacists and other extreme - right types are growing more common . In America they outnumber those committed by Islamists . Of 263 domestic terrorism incidents in 2010 - 17 , fully 92 were carried out by far - right attackers , compared with 38 by jihadists , according to an analysis of the Global Terrorism Database by the Washington Post . In Europe jihadist killings still predominate , but deaths from extremeright terrorism have surged since 2010 ( see chart on next page ) . 
 The past six months have seen a rash of far - right terrorist incidents . Last autumn a white nationalist killed 11 people at a synagogue in Pittsburgh . France broke up a plot to kill Emmanuel Macron , the president , and Spain arrested a fascist hoping to assassinate Pedro Sánchez , the prime minister . Germany uncovered an extremist cell in the army , allegedly planning to kill the foreign minister and others . In February America 's FBI arrested a Coast Guard officer who had an arsenal and a target - list of Democratic politicians . 
 Globally , white - nationalist terrorism is far less deadly than the jihadist variety . But it is more prevalent than authorities acknowledge , says Jacob Aasland Ravndal of Norway 's Centre for Research on Extremism . Legal definitions of terrorism often require that an attack be planned in advance . Much extreme - right violence is spontaneous . Even burning down a refugee centre may count as a hate crime , not terrorism . Europol , the EU 's law - enforcement agency , ascribed just 3 % of terrorist attacks in 2017 to the far right . But Mr Ravndal 's database of ideologically motivated violent incidents shows that in western Europe , though jihadists kill more people , the far right carry out more attacks . 
 More right than they know 
 If the threat from white nationalists is underestimated , that is partly because they are more publicity - shy . Mr Tarrant and his hero , Anders Breivik , who murdered 77 people in Norway in 2011 , were exceptions . They left manifestos and tried to maximise media exposure . Indeed , the Christchurch killer also resembled sophisticated jihadist outfits , both in the ostentatious cruelty of his crime and in his hope that it would polarise society , fuelling yet more extremism . 
 Islamic State tries to provoke the West into persecuting Muslims and thus driving sympathisers from the "" grey zone "" towards radical participation . Right - wing extremists may also hope to provoke an Islamist backlash . Police are investigating a possible terrorist motive behind the murder of three people on a tram in Utrecht in the Netherlands , three days after the massacre in Christchurch . A Turkish - born suspect has been arrested . 
 In Turkey President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has seized on the attack in Christchurch as evidence of a broad conspiracy against Turkey and Islam . He has quoted from the killer 's manifesto , which includes calls to expel Turks from Europe and to kill Mr Erdogan . The president 's not - so - subtle message is that only he can protect Turks from rampant white nationalism . 
 The Christchurch killer also hoped to provoke stricter gun laws , so that gunowners would rise up in revolt . There is not much chance of more gun control in America , Mr Tarrant 's primary target . However , Jacinda Ardern's , is moving to tighten Jacinda Ardern's country 's lax gun laws . This will not start a civil war . New Zealand prides itself on multiculturalism ( see Banyan ) . Its politics are more moderate than Australia 's . 
 That , along with its easy gun laws , may have been why Mr Tarrant picked New Zealand . He wrote that he wanted to prove that nowhere was safe . Muslims in Christchurch have lost all sense of security . Tofazzal Alam , who survived the attack , says he is now afraid "" to go to mosque , afraid of any crowd , afraid even to open the door "" . 
 Yet the killer 's manifesto was inspired by events far away in Europe . He claimed he was converted to radical - right ideology on a trip to France in 2017 , when he saw how much of the population was Muslim . He decorated his flak jacket with a "" black sun "" , a symbol traced to a floor motif used in his castle by Heinrich Himmler , a Nazi leader . He decorated his weapons with the names of victims of jihadist attacks in Stockholm and Paris . Before the shootings , he listened in his car to "" God is a Serb "" , a song written in 1993 in support of Radovan Karadzic - a Bosnian Serb leader convicted of genocide for his role in the massacre of 8,000 Muslims at Srebrenica in 1995 . 
 The idea that Muslims and non - whites are "" invaders "" imported by a cosmopolitan elite to replace ethnic Europeans has its roots in thinkers of the French "" new right "" of the 1970s , such as Alain de Benoist and Renaud Camus . It is often linked to the belief that multicultural societies , far from promoting diversity , extinguish it by mixing distinct cultures and races together . The nuttiest apostles of such notions equate immigration with genocide . 
 These ideas attracted the anti - Muslim populist politicians who sprung up across Europe around the turn of the millennium , especially after the September 11th attacks in America . They inspired the far - right youth network Generation Identity . But the big impetus came in 2015 - 16 , when some 2 m asylum - seekers , mostly from the Middle East , poured into Europe . 
 For right - wing populists , this crisis was a godsend . Viktor Orban , Hungary 's prime minister , built a fence against the migrants and began calling himself a defender of Christian Europe . A frenzied opposition to Muslim immigration ( real or imaginary ) is the lodestar of populist - right parties in Germany , Poland , Sweden and Italy . At the European Parliament this month , Javier Ortega Smith of Vox , a new far - right Spanish party , thundered that had Spanish and Venetian fleets not won the battle of Lepanto against the Turks in 1571 , every female mep "" would be wearing a burqa "" . 
 Daniel Koehler of the German Institute on Radicalisation and De - radicalisation Studies says that it is no coincidence that extreme - right violence jumped during the migrant crisis , along with the fortunes of far - right parties : "" If you think you have ... to protect against ' invaders'-how do you do that without using force ? "" 
 In America , too , the rise in extremeright violence is linked to mainstream politics . Between 2009 and 2018 , white supremacists killed more than three - quarters of the 313 people murdered by extremists . In 2016 , the year Donald Trump won the presidency , more anti - Muslim assaults were reported to the FBI ( 127 ) than in any year since 2001(93 ) . 
 Such attacks rose steeply after Barack Obama 's election in 2008 . Daryl Johnson , who spent 15 years studying right - wing terrorist groups , including at the Department of Homeland Security ( DHS ) , wrote a paper in 2009 warning that the arrival that year of a black person in the White House could spark far - right violence . Demonised by conservatives for this , he left the DHS in 2010 . Today , he says , it has no experts in right - wing terrorism . A spokesman did not deny this , but , in an email , said that the DHS is "" committed to combating all forms of violent extremism , especially those that espouse racial supremacy or bigotry "" . 
 In denial 
 Mr Trump has played down the threat of right - wing extremists , calling them "" a small group of people that have very , very serious problems "" . In 2017 his administration cancelled grants to groups combating white - supremacism . Peter Singer , a cybersecurity expert at the New America Foundation who was invited to speak to Mr Trump 's national - security staff that year , said that they dismissed white - supremacist terrorism as "" a law - enforcement issue "" , and denied that it is transnational . 
 In fact , the ties between American and European extreme - right groups are ever closer . Europe 's Generation Identity groups are linked to Identity Evropa , one of the the American far - right organisations that planned a "" Unite the Right "" rally in Charlottesville , Virginia in 2017 , where a white nationalist drove his car into a crowd and killed a counter - protester . Marchers at that rally chanted "" Jews will not replace us "" , referring to the same "" great replacement "" thesis shared by European extremists and the Christchurch killer . 
 Mr Trump has played the role for American white nationalists that such leaders as Mr Orban played for Europe 's , says Brian Levin , who heads the Centre for the Study of Hate and Extremism at California State University , San Bernardino . These groups , he says , saw their ideas , such as building a wall like Mr Orban 's , and banning or deporting Muslims , "" getting into the mainstream tent "" . They took this as a "" green light "" for violence . And he notes that , like the young on Europe 's extremist right , they have softened their image in the past decade . Shaved heads and combat boots have given way to army haircuts , polo shirts and corduroy jackets . 
 Far - right groups lack the state sponsors and safe havens enjoyed by some jihadists . Many on the extreme right admire Russia but it does not fit the bill . It has cultivated ties with far - right parties in Europe , but has snuffed out extremists at home . In the 2000s hate - motivated attacks , often directed at immigrants and internal migrants from the north Caucasus , reached nearly 700 a year , as the state flirted with nationalist movements . Clashes in Moscow in 2011 between police and far - right groups mixed with football hooligans showed the dangers of tolerating the ultranationalists . After they joined anti - government protests in 2011 - 12 , the state began shutting them down , detaining the most violent . In 2014 war with Ukraine split the movement into pro - government and proUkrainian factions . The sova Centre , an independent monitor , recorded just 57 hatemotivated attacks in 2018 . 
 The Ukrainian model 
 Other Western white nationalists look to Ukraine itself , a hotbed of far - right activity since the Maidan uprising in 2014 . Quasifascist militias , such as the Azov Battalion , have fought Russia in the east and taken a role in policing . So Kiev is "" a place of attraction for the global far - right "" , says Anton Shekhovtsov , of the University of Vienna . Some European radicals have joined Ukrainians on the front lines . American white supremacists have been spotted in Kiev . But as Mr Shekhovtsov puts it , "" migration is a first - world problem "" , and , whereas earlier far - right groups would beat up foreigners from Africa and Asia , Azov is keener on disrupting gay - pride marches . In any case , Ukrainian men seeking romantic violence have plenty to do in the east . 
 A more pressing concern for Western governments is far - right radicalism within their armed forces . Soldiers , obviously , are trained and have access to weapons . In America the DHS warned a decade ago that right - wing extremists will attempt to "" recruit and radicalise "" veterans , recalling the terrorist attacks of the 1990s by bitter exsoldiers , such as the Oklahoma City bombing . A study of 119 lone - actor terrorists across America and Europe since 1990 found that 26 % had done military service .

The government tries to live up to its welcoming reputation
""THEY ARE us,"" said Jacinda Ardern, T New Zealand's prime minister, of the 51Muslims, many of them immigrants, who were murdered by a white nationalist in Christchurch in March. She has positioned herself as a leader ""with a bit of heart"". So it was embarrassing that her centre-left government had kept a policy that all but excluded any refugees from Africa and the Middle East. The government has announced that it will amend the rules in question, which are ""the very definition of discrimination"", according to the immigration minister, Iain Lees-Galloway.
They were inherited from the conservative National Party, which surreptitiously ordained in 2009 that refugees from the Middle East and Africa could come to New Zealand only if they had relatives living there already. Few did, so their numbers dwindled, even though New Zealand technically allocated 28% of its total intake of refugees to the two regions. Over the past nine years it has accepted just 187 people from the entire continent of Africa-fewer than arrived in the single year before the policy came into force, according to Murdoch Stephens of Massey University.
Politicians had defended the policy on the basis that it gave priority to people from countries nearer to New Zealand. Over the past decade, 60% of refugees have come from Asia and the Pacific. But official documents show that the government was motivated by ""broad security concerns"" as well. The rules were racist and Islamophobic, says Guled Mire, an activist who campaigned against them.
Ms Ardern's Labour Party might have changed the rules sooner, but its populist coalition partner, New Zealand First, wanted to keep them. It has now been talked into raising the quotas for Africans and Middle Easterners to 15% of the total apiece. Ms Ardern's government is also lifting the cap on the total number of refugees New Zealand admits each year from 1,000 to 1,500.
Advocates for refugees say New Zealand should do more. Even relative to its population of 4.8m, the number of asylum-seekers it lets in is tiny. Australia, despite ferociously guarding its borders against unauthorised migrants arriving by boat, lets in close to 20,000 refugees through official channels annually- more than twice as many per person as New Zealand will under the new rules.
What is more, New Zealand has also resolved to show no quarter to ""boat people""-even though no people-smuggling vessels have ever been discovered in its waters. In this year's ""well-being"" budget, the government allocated NZ$25m ($16m) to discouraging any from ever attempting the journey.","Refugees in Jacinda Ardern tries to live up to Jacinda Ardern's welcoming reputation

Which nation made the most of 2019?
Our annual ""country of the year"" award celebrates improvement. Each December, therefore, we give a hostage to fortune. The places that climb furthest are often those that started near the bottom: poor, ill-governed and unstable. Freshly won democracy and peace do not always last, as Aung San Suu Kyi, the leader of Myanmar (The Economist's country of the year in 2015) ended up reminding the world when she appeared recently at the International Court of Justice in The Hague and glossed over the ethnic cleansing of the Rohingyas, a Muslim minority, by her country's soldiers.
In 2019 the most striking political trend was a negative one: belligerent nationalism. India has been stripping Muslims of citizenship, China has been locking up Muslims in camps, America has taken a wrecking ball to global institutions. So strong was the global tide that it was a relief to see some countries paddling the other way. New Zealand deserves an honourable mention for its response to a massacre in mosques by a white nationalist. Jacinda Ardern, the prime minister, put on a headscarf and declared that an attack on Muslims was an attack on all New Zealanders. Her government banned semi-automatic weapons and bought thousands of them from the public.
Even more impressive was North Macedonia, which changed its name to promote peace with its neighbour. Greece had objected that its former moniker, Macedonia, implied a claim to the Greek region of the same name. Greek intransigence prevented the Macedonians from joining nato or starting negotiations to join the European Union. So lawmakers in Skopje swallowed their pride and voted to rename their country; the change took effect in February. Relations with Greece are now much warmer. A source of discord has been removed from a tetchy region. North Macedonia is on track to join nato. Alas, Emmanuel Macron, the president of France (country of the year 2017) is blocking its candidacy for the eu, fearing that welcoming another Balkan state into the club would irk French voters.
Two countries became notably less despotic in 2019. In Sudan mass protests led to the ejection of Omar al-Bashir, one of the world's vilest tyrants. His Islamist regime had murdered and enslaved so many black Africans that a third of the country broke away to form South Sudan in 2011. Mr Bashir was convicted of corruption in a Sudanese court on December 14th (see Middle East & Africa section) but seems unlikely to be extradited to stand trial for overseeing genocide in Darfur. A new power-sharing government vows to hold elections in three years, is negotiating peace in Darfur and has eased the dress code for women. However, the risk that thugs from the old regime may scupper democratic reforms is still worryingly high.
So the winner is a country Herman Cain, an American presidential candidate, once dismissed as ""Ubeki-beki-beki-stanstan"". Three years ago Uzbekistan was an old-fashioned postSoviet dictatorship, a closed society run with exceptional brutality and incompetence. Its regime allegedly boiled dissidents alive, and certainly forced legions of men, women and children to toil in the cotton fields at harvest time.
When Islam Karimov, the despot for 27 years, died in 2016, he was succeeded by his prime minister, Shavkat Mirziyoyev. At first, little changed. But after dumping the head of the security services in 2018, Mr Mirziyoyev began reforms that have accelerated over the past year. His government has largely ended forced labour. Its most notorious prison camp has been closed. Foreign journalists are let in. Bureaucrats are banned from calling on small businesses, which they previously did constantly, to bully them for bribes. More border crossings have opened, helping unite families divided by Central Asia's crazy quilt of frontiers. Foreign technocrats have been invited to help overhaul the state-stifled economy.
Uzbekistan is to hold parliamentary elections before the new year (see Asia section). Although it is far from a democracy-all of the parties support Mr Mirziyoyev and some critics remain behind bars-some of the candidates have offered mild criticisms of the government, which would previously have been unthinkable. Ordinary Uzbeks, too, feel free to lampoon the campaign and grumble about the political class, without fear of being dragged off in the middle of the night. Uzbekistan still has a long way to go, but no other country travelled as far in 2019.","Country of the year

We read with consternation your recommendation of hormone therapy (ht) for menopausal women (""The time of her life"", December 14th). The media swing from admonishing women that hormone therapy will hasten their death to advising them that it will save their lives. Although ht has very real benefits for alleviating menopausal symptoms, no consistent evidence shows that it prevents cardiovascular disease. Some studies suggest a benefit, others find no benefit or even harm. The problem arises when the findings of one study are disregarded while the findings of another (potentially even more flawed) study are taken as fact.
Meta-analyses and systematic reviews consolidate evidence across multiple randomised clinical trials. Overall, randomised controlled trials have shown that ht has no net effect on risk of death and no reduction in coronary heart disease regardless of whether it was initiated at a younger or older age. Finally, a recent Cochrane Review specifically states that ht should not be used to prevent cardiovascular disease on the basis of the current evidence. The claim that hormone therapy saves lives is rooted in sensationalism, not science.

As a life scientist, I have long been dismayed by the quality of the research conducted by the Women's Health Initiative (whi). As a woman, I have been stunned by the willingness of most members of the medical community to accept the whi report and its recommendations without question, continually recommending that women avoid or discontinue hormone therapy.
I once asked my doctor whether he had seen any positive effects in patients who take the treatment. ""Yes,"" he said, ""they don't grow old as fast."" So, I am delighted that The Economist has had the courage to do what too few others have done: debunk the whi study and recommend the health advantages of ht.

You say that despite a public scare based on the flawed whi study, hormone therapy has the potential to safely improve women's lives. Yet in ""Naked Statistics"", written by Charles Wheelan in 2013, the whi study is presented as a rigorous controlled experiment. He quotes a statement that the death toll from unnecessarily prescribed ht is in the ""tens of thousands"". It would appear that the evidence is on The Economist's side. Yet what is a non-specialist to do? Despite reaching opposite conclusions, both The Economist and Mr Wheelan write clearly and with the confidence of experts. Unfortunately, that leaves the rest of us ever warier.

The patents process is fair
Rolling back the advances that have been made in America's patent system (""The trouble with patent-troll hunting"", December 14th) would only reduce fairness and vastly increase the cost of patent disputes. You pointed to the example of a small firm with ""no in-house lawyers"" that has run up expensive bills defending the validity of its asserted patents before the us Patent and Trademark Office. Yet these inter partes reviews are fair, highly successful administrative proceedings created by Congress in 2011.
In fact, the uspto process costs less than litigating the issues in federal court. Small businesses, often manufacturers, rely on these more costeffective administrative proceedings to avoid the crushing costs of litigation when patents of dubious validity are brought against them. Reducing the cost of a meritorious patent challenge, and clarifying the standards of patentability, improve the patent system by making it more efficient, thereby reducing the opportunity for rent-seeking behaviour. It has been estimated that reviews before the uspto have reduced the cumulative cost of patent litigation by billions of dollars.

You commended the decision by Jacinda Ardern, New Zealand's prime minister, to don a headscarf when she comforted relatives of the victims of an attack on mosques (""The improvement prize"", December 21st). Ms Ardern even inspired a group of women to start the Headscarf for Harmony initiative, a hit on social media. Yet many Muslim women who are campaigning not to have to cover their head disagree with these symbolic acts.
Ms Ardern and others might have meant well. But female Muslims who have had to endure punishments and harassment to stand by their freedom of appearance now face renewed rebuke from their families, who watched nonMuslims honour the hijab.

From hero to zero
There is an interesting historical nugget to Andrew Johnson's acquittal by the Senate following his impeachment by the House in 1868 (""The die is cast"", December 14th). The president was cleared by the Senate after it fell just one vote short to remove him from office. The man who cast the decisive vote to acquit, Edmund Ross of Kansas, became the subject of a chapter in John F. Kennedy's ""Profiles in Courage"" for resisting party pressure to dump Johnson and install a fellow Republican in the Oval Office. The book won a Pulitzer prize, but this account of Ross acting as a bulwark against despotism has been called into question, as many contemporary scholars believe he was merely bribed by Johnson's cronies.

Hot off the press!
Your Christmas special on hot-metal type printing brought tears to my eyes (""The age of mechanical reproduction as a work of art"", December 21st). I remember visiting my father at the New York Post in its old headquarters on South Street. My favourite place was the press room where they made hot type. While reading the article, I saw Lenny, the senior Linotype operator, in his white apron hunched over the keyboard, typing with two fingers, cigarette in his mouth, ashes all over the keyboard. The smell of molten metal and printer's ink. I stood transfixed and watched the magic of this huge machine producing metal letters.
Lenny would hold them in his blistered and calloused hands, turning them over and peering intently at each letter. Every so often he would take one and shove it at me. ""Take this, kid,"" he would say. I didn't realise at the time that they were the rejects, but I clutched them as if they were rare gems dug out of a deep mine. I took them home and saved every one. Decades and many apartments and homes later, I still have the precious relics in the top drawer of my desk.

Remote and pristine, the tiny island nations of the Pacific are often the object of apocalypse-proofing fantasies. But if you think they are in any state to ride out covid-19, dream on.
Many Pacific jurisdictions have thrown up barriers to the new coronavirus. In late January the Federated States of Micronesia banned entry to travellers from countries with confirmed cases. The Cook Islands, Fiji, French Polynesia, New Caledonia, Papua New Guinea (png), Tonga and Vanuatu have banned cruise ships. Anyone coming to Samoa has had to produce a medical certificate. In early March the Marshall Islands sealed itself off, banning all inbound visitors. Even supply vessels must wait 14 days at sea before berthing.
The economic cost will be devastating. The island states import nearly everything. Moreover, tourism is the main earner for many. Fiji had a fullblown fiscal crisis even before empty hotels removed a big source of revenue. The Northern Marianas, an American territory, relies on vanished visitors from China, Japan and South Korea. Writing to President Donald Trump for help, the governor warned of the ""unequivocal and complete collapse of the foundations of our private sector"".
If the measures kept the coronavirus at bay, they might be worth it. But they won't. Already, five cases have been confirmed in Guam, five in French Polynesia (including a returning member of France's National Assembly), two in New Caledonia and one in Fiji. One is suspected in png. Testing facilities barely exist in the South Pacific-samples are sent to Australia or New Zealand-although Fiji has raced to set one up.
The coronavirus has many routes to spread. png, the region's most populous state, has a porous border with Australia, just across the Torres Strait, and a land border with Indonesia. It is trying to seal the sea-lanes to the nearby Solomon Islands. Tuvalu and Kiribati are among the tiniest, most isolated states in the world, yet many of their menfolk work as seafarers, with a history of carrying infectious diseases home. Half of the populations of Samoa and Tonga are abroad, many in infected countries. There are more possible vectors than isolated atolls.
It is cause for alarm. The Marshall Islands is only now recovering from a dengue outbreak infecting 3,000, followed by bursts of influenza. It left the little hospital in the capital, Majuro, looking ""like a war zone"", says the health secretary, Jack Niedenthal. An outbreak of measles in Samoa in December killed 83, most of them children. Both countries are racing to respond to covid-19. But the Marshall Islands has just six ventilators. Of just 100 protective gowns, goggles and gloves, the hospital got through 22 sets investigating a single suspected case. Meanwhile, the Solomon Islands has such a dilapidated health system that many will view the main hospital in Honiara, the capital, as the last place to go with covid-19.
To cope with the pandemic, Pacific islanders will be thrown back on support networks such as family and church. People are all too used to catastrophes, from cyclones to tsunamis. Only rarely, as Jonathan Pryke of the Lowy Institute in Sydney puts it, do they feel the hand of the state. Traditional networks will prove a blessing, but also carry risks if infections are carried back to villages from capitals. It helps that Pacific populations are relatively young (covid-19 guns for the elderly and infirm). But high rates of non-communicable diseases, notably diabetes, put more people at risk. Thanks to an atrocious diet (think Spam and Kool-Aid), seven of the ten most diabetic countries are in the Pacific. The hospital in Honiara saws off three limbs a day.
Peter Kenilorea, an opposition figure in the Solomon Islands, says the government is unprepared. In its speech marking the opening of Parliament in Honiara this week, only two sentences were devoted to covid-19. A radio station in Fiji has been broadcasting public-health advice for weeks about washing hands. Yet the government will not let it link those messages to the pandemic, lest they spark panic.
Australia and New Zealand both emphasise what New Zealand's leader, Jacinda Ardern, calls ""a duty of care"" to Pacific nations. Both countries have promised to send medical equipment and personnel.

Tahiti later suffered devastating epidemics of smallpox, dysentery, scarlet fever and measles in quick succession. Gauguin infected three child brides and a string of adolescents with syphilis. Missionaries carried death too. When Robert Louis Stevenson visited the Marquesas in 1888, so many had died no one remembered the old songs and dances, and coffins had become prestige items. The population of Hawaii fell from perhaps 250,000 in Cook's time to less than 40,000 by the end of the 19th century. Bear this history in mind when you hear Fiji's strongman, Frank Bainimarama, warning those tempted to break the current curfew: ""It doesn't matter how famous you are, it doesn't matter how rich you are... No one is immune to our laws."" With weak health systems and many vulnerable citizens, South Pacific countries cannot risk an outbreak of covid-19.

The devastation Cyclone Harold inflicted this week on Vanuatu only highlights smaller countries' vulnerability.

NELSON, NEW ZEALAND
Several countries appear to be beating covid-19. What happens next?
Of all the new rules police in Australia and New Zealand have found themselves trying to enforce in recent weeks, one of the trickiest has been preventing surfing. Officers have had, on occasion, to wade into the water to remonstrate with wave-catching scofflaws, many of whom scaled fences or clambered down cliffs to ride the breakers. Deliverance is at hand, however-in more than one sense. Restrictions on surfing are being eased, since the new coronavirus appears to be under control in both countries.
In New Zealand, a country of 5m people, new cases have been in the single digits for most of the past week. Australia reported just seven new infections on April 23rd. That puts the pair in the very small group of countries that seem to have vanquished covid-19, including South Korea and, barring a fresh wave of infections from a recent outbreak on a naval vessel, Taiwan. Australia has already reopened some popular beaches (for swimming and surfing only) and will soon resume elective surgeries, dental care and fertility treatment. South Korea is allowing domestic tourism, although one county cut down fields of tulips to avoid attracting the usual crowds of sightseers. Taiwan, remarkably, never shut all schools, restaurants or bars.
In all four places officials caution that life is not going back to normal yet. For one thing, there can be no letting down their guard. The authorities have warned that a second wave of the virus may hit in winter. To ward that off, South Korea intends to keep up extensive testing and vigorous contact-tracing using security-camera footage, credit-card statements and mobile-phone location data. The movements of confirmed cases are made public, worrying privacy activists and adulterers alike. Australia, too, promises ""aggressive suppression"" using contact-tracing and one of the highest rates of testing in the world. New Zealand is going one step further. It has set itself the goal of eliminating the virus entirely from its shores.
The benefits of elimination are clear. Whereas many countries risk a debilitating cycle of lockdowns, gradual reopenings and then fresh restrictions as the outbreak waxes and wanes, New Zealand's government believes it may soon be able to send Kiwis young and old back to work without fear that the number of cases might start to surge again. ""The recovery could be smoother and less hampered than in other places,"" says Shamubeel Eaqub, an economist. Schools, shops and restaurants could operate without special social-distancing requirements. The rugby season could begin, with matches in front of live audiences (to the relief of bored sports fans around the world).
All this would in theory provide the sort of clarity for businesses which seems like a pipe-dream elsewhere. Hiring and investment would presumably revive much more quickly if the fear of a future resurgence of covid-19 could be dispelled. ""The worst thing we can do for our country is yo-yo between levels [of lockdown],"" says Jacinda Ardern, the prime minister.
Yet finding every last case of the virus will be difficult. ""It's a needle-in-a-haystack phenomenon,"" says Ayesha Verrall of Otago University. The current random testing of workers in risky jobs, regardless of symptoms, will need to be expanded. Contact-tracing will also need to be made more watertight. Initially, the government had trouble reaching 40% of people it thought might have been exposed to the disease.
Moreover, elimination will entail the strictest border controls. At present, almost all foreigners are barred from entering the country, while returning citizens are placed in quarantine for 14 days in monitored hotels. Arrivals have slowed to a trickle: on April 22nd not a single person entered the country.
Ports are tightly controlled, too. Stevedores at Auckland's work in small, isolated teams, each with their own toilet, to reduce the risk of an infection spreading widely. The crews of arriving ships are not allowed to disembark and can interact with only three port workers, who are distinguished by pink high-visibility vests, not to mention face masks.
The government's economic models assume New Zealand will have to stay closed to foreigners for a year. But some doubt it is feasible, or worthwhile, to keep the borders sealed. Steven Joyce, a former finance minister, says eliminating the virus is ""pie in the sky"". Australia's Chief Medical Officer, Brendan Murphy, says that although elimination is desirable, ""We're pretty doubtful that could be maintained for the long term given the incredible border measures you would need to have.""
Even if elimination succeeds, many big industries in New Zealand cannot hope to return to normal. A halt to international tourism, most notably, will knock about 5% off gdp and put some 100,000 people out of work. Border closures will hit farmers, too. Each year New Zealand and Australia bring in hundreds of thousands of backpackers and seasonal workers to pick fruit and prune grape vines. With borders closed, wineries and farms are shortstaffed. Mike Chapman of Horticulture New Zealand, a lobby group, worries that it will be difficult to tempt unemployed urbanites up ladders to pick apples.
Exporters are struggling to find space on the few planes still leaving the country. Before the crisis 80% of New Zealand's air freight was carried on passenger planes. Air New Zealand, the national carrier, has cut 95% of its international passenger flights. Crayfish farmers beat tomatogrowers to some of the scarce outbound capacity, Mr Chapman notes ruefully.
In the meantime, in pursuit of elimination, Ms Ardern recently announced a fiveday extension of New Zealand's strict lockdown. The extra short-term cost, she says, will give ""much greater long-term health and economic returns"".
Others are managing borders differently. South Korea still admits foreigners, provided they remain in quarantine for 14 days. A few can even evade quarantine, including some business people on short trips. They are tested on arrival and, if negative, can travel widely on the condition that they answer when called by health workers and diligently record any symptoms in an app. Taiwan is permitting some business visitors, too, subject to quarantine rules.
Yet New Zealand's elimination plan has widespread public support. A poll in early April found that 84% of New Zealanders approve of the government's response to the pandemic-30 percentage points higher than the average in the G7. There is even hope that other countries may be able to join its putative virus-free zone. The deputy prime minister, Winston Peters, has raised the prospect of a ""trans-Tasman bubble"" once both Australia and New Zealand have the virus tightly under control. That could also include some Pacific countries-provided it does not burst. -","When the epidemic is over 
 NELSON , NEW ZEALAND 
 Several countries appear to be beating covid-19 . What happens next ? 
 Of all the new rules police in Australia and New Zealand have found themselves trying to enforce in recent weeks , one of the trickiest has been preventing surfing . Officers have had , on occasion , to wade into the water to remonstrate with wave - catching scofflaws , many of whom scaled fences or clambered down cliffs to ride the breakers . Deliverance is at hand , however - in more than one sense . Restrictions on surfing are being eased , since the new coronavirus appears to be under control in both countries . 
 In New Zealand , a country of 5 m people , new cases have been in the single digits for most of the past week . Australia reported just seven new infections on April 23rd . That puts the pair in the very small group of countries that seem to have vanquished covid-19 , including South Korea and , barring a fresh wave of infections from a recent outbreak on a naval vessel , Taiwan . Australia has already reopened some popular beaches ( for swimming and surfing only ) and will soon resume elective surgeries , dental care and fertility treatment . South Korea is allowing domestic tourism , although one county cut down fields of tulips to avoid attracting the usual crowds of sightseers . Taiwan , remarkably , never shut all schools , restaurants or bars . 
 In all four places officials caution that life is not going back to normal yet . For one thing , there can be no letting down their guard . The authorities have warned that a second wave of the virus may hit in winter . To ward that off , South Korea intends to keep up extensive testing and vigorous contact - tracing using security - camera footage , credit - card statements and mobile - phone location data . The movements of confirmed cases are made public , worrying privacy activists and adulterers alike .

More states began easing their lockdowns. Florida allowed shops to trade if they limit customers, except in the heavily populated corridor between Miami and Palm Beach. In Michigan, the scene of rowdy anti-lockdown protests, the Republican legislature refused a request from the Democratic governor to extend her stay-at-home order. She extended it anyway.
America's Supreme Court worked remotely for the first time, hearing arguments via teleconferences. The normally reticent Clarence Thomas, a justice on the court since 1991, asked questions, only his third comments during hearings in more than a decade. Ruth Bader Ginsburg, who is 87, was in hospital with an infection and took part from there.
America's secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, said there was ""enormous evidence"" that covid-19 came from a laboratory in Wuhan, but did not provide any. China reacted angrily. State television called him ""evil"".
A Chinese journalist who had worked for state media was sentenced to 15 years in prison for ""picking quarrels and provoking trouble...and bribery"". ""Picking quarrels"" is a term often used by the government to describe political dissent.
Kim Jong Un, North Korea's dictator, resurfaced without explanation after a three-week absence. State media published images of him touring a fertiliser factory.
A regulator in the Philippines ordered abs-cbn, a big television network, to stop broadcasting after its licence expired. Rodrigo Duterte, the president, had previously complained about bias and had threatened to take it off the air. But officials insist that Mr Duterte has no strong feelings about renewing the licence.
Dariga Nazarbayeva was removed as the head of Kazakhstan's Senate and thus as the first in line to the presidency. Her father, Nursultan Nazarbayev, resigned as president in 2019, but remains head of a powerful committee in charge of national security. The personal lives and financial affairs of Ms Nazarbayeva and her sons have been the subject of legal proceedings in London in recent months.
Israel's Supreme Court refused to block a power-sharing deal between Binyamin Netanyahu, the prime minister, and Benny Gantz, his old rival. It also rejected petitions that aimed to disqualify Mr Netanyahu because he faces prosecution on corruption charges. The rulings pave the way for a new government to be sworn in.
Iraq's parliament approved a new prime minister, nearly six months after the previous one resigned amid big protests. Mustafa al-Kadhimi, a former intelligence chief, was acceptable to both America and Iran. But he faces big challenges at home, where the coronavirus has frozen the economy and oil and gas revenues have plummeted. Earlier, Islamic State carried out several attacks in Iraq, killing at least 18 people.
The government in cash-strapped Lebanon adopted an economic-reform plan and requested assistance from the imf. This came after protesters, defying a coronavirus lockdown, took to the streets to vent their anger over a deteriorating economy and poor governance.
A leaked letter from Zimbabwe to the imf warned that the country is heading towards economic collapse and that it needs assistance in clearing its existing debts to unlock new funding. The letter said Zimbabwe's economy could shrink by 15-20% this year.
In a decision with potentially huge implications Germany's constitutional court declared that the European Central Bank had acted improperly in buying government bonds under a quantitative-easing programme. Many legal experts fear that because the ecb is supposed to answer only to eu institutions, not to member governments, a constitutional crisis is being created.
Italy partly emerged from eight weeks of lockdown, having been the first country in Europe to impose one. People can now go out to exercise, cafés have reopened for takeaway service and travel to visit close relatives is now permitted.
Canada banned assault-style weapons with immediate effect following a gun massacre in April.
Venezuelan forces intercepted two boatloads of men allegedly trying to overthrow the country's dictator, Nicolás Maduro. Eight of the men were killed. Mr Maduro accused America and Colombia of plotting the attack. As evidence, a captive was paraded, post-interrogation, on television. Meanwhile, a security contractor based in Florida claimed responsibility for the ""daring amphibious raid"". The governments of America and Colombia denied any involvement.
The new chief of Brazil's Federal Police, Rolando Souza, transferred the head of the force in Rio de Janeiro. Mr Souza became police chief after the Supreme Court blocked the man initially chosen by Jair Bolsonaro, the Brazilian president, who is a friend of the president's family. Mr Bolsonaro is facing claims that he tried to influence investigations, centred on Rio, into his family, which he denies.
The worldwide death toll from covid-19 rose above 250,000.
Infections surged in Russia, to over 10,000 a day. Mikhail Mishustin, the prime minister, tested positive for the disease.
The first infection was officially confirmed in Sana'a, Yemen's capital, which is held by Houthi rebels.
Reports from Nigeria, Somalia and Tanzania of a sharp rise in unexplained deaths suggested that official tallies of covid-19 are misleadingly low.
New Zealand's prime minister, Jacinda Ardern, said border restrictions would remain for ""some time to come"". But she would like a quarantine-free travel ""bubble"" with Australia.
In Germany shops were allowed to reopen, with social distancing. Football matches will resume in the Bundesliga, but without spectators.

The crisis exposes our weaknesses. Will our leaders choose reform or calamity?
In the winter of 1788-89, the desperate government of Louis XVI asked the French people to send in lists of their grievances. It was a fatal mistake. The cahiers de doléances served to articulate the public's unspoken discontent and, equally important, its hopes for a better world. A crucial psychological barrier had fallen: it became possible to imagine a very different France. And the times- the moral and actual bankruptcy of the Ancien Régime, widespread crop failures and hopeless leadership-gave shape to the public's aspirations. The fuse was lit for revolution.
France in 1789. Russia in 1917. The Europe of the 1930s. The pandemic of 2020. They are all junctures where the river of history changes direction. The covid-19 crisis may be a pivotal rather than a revolutionary moment but it, too, is challenging the old order. Like France's cahiers, the coronavirus forces questions about what sort of future we want, what the proper role of government is and what makes a healthy society. We face a choice: to build better ways of dealing domestically and internationally with this challenge (and prepare for inevitable future ones) or let our world become meaner and more selfish, divided and suspicious.
Long before covid-19, popular thinkers like Thomas Piketty, the late Tony Judt and Paul Krugman were warning about deep social inequalities and the shortcomings of globalisation. There were sporadic protests like Occupy Wall Street or France's gilets jaunes. Most of us (such is human nature) carried on living. We worried from time to time about climate change, that our children couldn't afford houses and that there seemed to be more obscenely rich people along with more homeless ones. Covid-19 has turned a spotlight on the dark sides of our world. We have become aware of the fragility of international supply lines, the disadvantages of offshore sources for critical goods and the limits of international bodies. The chaotic responses and blame games of certain governments have exacerbated divisions in and among societies, perhaps permanently. America has withdrawn from moral and material leadership of the world. It and China have grown more hostile to one another, not less. Rogue states such as Russia gleefully make more trouble and the un is increasingly marginalised.
When you name things-grievances, say, as the French did- you give them form and make it harder to ignore them. We are doing that now with the flaws in our world and spelling out our hopes for something better. As the French looked at Britain and America as models, we can see that South Korea, Denmark and New Zealand have controlled the pandemic more effectively than other countries, in part because their peoples have faith in the authorities and each other. Without trust-that the water is clean, medicines are safe, or thugs won't get away with it-societies are vulnerable. Covid-19 has caused fewer deaths proportionately in Germany than elsewhere because of the country's well-funded health system and its competent state and federal governments. As history shows, those societies that survive and adapt best to catastrophes are already strong. Britain rose to the challenge of the Nazis because it was united; France was not and did not.
Much also depended then, and depends now, on leaders. As weaknesses are exposed, do leaders fix or exploit them? While Franklin Roosevelt was promising Americans a better tomorrow in the 1930s, Adolf Hitler was destroying the Weimar Republic and intoxicating Germans with promises of revenge for the Treaty of Versailles. As we know, that ended in a world war.
For every Jacinda Ardern or Angela Merkel, the leaders of New Zealand and Germany who are talking to their citizens about the difficult road ahead, there is an illiberal, populist demagogue playing to baser fears and fantasies. In Brazil President Jair Bolsonaro dismisses covid-19 as ""the sniffles""; in India the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party blames it on the Muslims. President Donald Trump claimed he had ""total"" authority, demonstrating something about his instincts if not his knowledge of the American constitution.
Wise leaders in the past have been able to steer away from danger. In 1830 Britain was coping with unrest in Ireland, violent strikes at home and demands for more power from the growing commercial and industrial middle classes. The enlightened aristocrats of the new Whig government believed that they had a choice between revolution and reform, even if the latter was at the expense of their own power and privilege. In 1832 their Great Reform Act widened the franchise for Parliament. The Whigs did not remove all grievances, but they muted them. A century later another child of privilege, Roosevelt, brought in the New Deal which helped to save American society and capitalism.
The present crisis could be the opportunity for strategies to produce essential public goods and ensure that citizens have safe, decent and fulfilled lives. People coming out of a calamity are open to sweeping changes. Governments will find it hard to resist demands for improved social programmes now that they are spending as though John Maynard Keynes were in the room. Will the British again accept an underfunded National Health Service? And countries could invest in key organisations like the World Health Organisation and give it greater power to protect the world from disease. Perhaps, just perhaps, bodies such as the G7 and G20 could become forums for unity and not dissent.
Future historians, if there are any who can still research and speak freely, will analyse the choices that individual countries and the world made. Let us hope the story shows the better angels of our nature, in Abraham Lincoln's words: enlightened leaders and publics creating together sane and inclusive policies, and strengthening our vital institutions at home and abroad. The alternative story will not have a happy ending.","By invitation

Diaries written at times of crisis can be a source of solace and inspiration
The diaries of Virginia Woolf are bookended by wars. Early entries, written when she was a young novelist, describe sheltering in her kitchen during the nowforgotten air-raids over London in 1917. Over nearly three decades she would fill 26 volumes, usually settling down after tea to write up the day or, if she had been laid low by mental illness, as she often was, to recount events spanning weeks or months. Her observations of people, places and books are sometimes catty and prejudiced, often wry and incisive. In October 1940, an established modernist author living in Sussex, she chronicled another conflict:
I want to look back on these war years as years of positive something or other...Queer the contraction of life to the village radius. Wood bought enough to stock many winters. All our friends are isolated over winter fires. Chance of interruption small now. No cars. No petrol. Trains uncertain. And we on our lovely free autumn island.
Five months later, as she sensed another nervous breakdown approaching, Woolf would drown herself in the River Ouse. Yet on that autumn day she could find solace in the quiet of village life-in ""October blooms; brown plough; and the fading and freshening of the marsh."" Her diary is testament to the complex, shifting moods of a brilliant mind, but also to the possibility of finding beauty amid chaos.
During a crisis, whether political or personal, writing a diary can be a comfort. In March, as lockdowns were imposed around the world in response to covid-19, columnists advised the quarantined to keep a journal of the warped new reality in which they communicated with loved ones through pixelated screens. Astronauts disclosed how recording their thoughts and dreams helped them endure the loneliness of space. New Zealand's prime minister, Jacinda Ardern, encouraged people to annotate their days for a more prosaic reason: it could aid in tracing the disease.
But for frazzled minds, with attention spans cut by the rolling, roiling news, prying into other lives can be even more therapeutic than documenting your own. Unlike novels, which demand commitment or at least the pretence of it, you can dip in and out of diaries; they are episodic by nature, broken into shards of days, weeks and months. Entries are often hastily written, and can be consumed just as quickly. Sometimes, as with the contraction of Woolf's world and her isolated friends, they offer unexpected parallels with the pandemic-suggesting that, in the face of very different adversities, people have experienced familiar feelings and fears.
Take Samuel Pepys's diaries, which describe the course of the plague that hit London in 1665, when he was 32. His early entries that year are filled with blithe, gluttonous descriptions of food, plays and women. Arguments with his wife feature prominently. In April he ""Lay long in bed, troubled a little with wind, but not much.""
The uses of adversity
By the end of that month, however, he refers to another ailment: ""Great fears of the Sicknesse here in the City, it being said that two or three houses are already shut up."" By June he sees red crosses painted on doors; before long, the ""town grows very sickly, and people [are] afeared"". Yet still the disease seems distant-disbelief and denial always seem to accompany epidemics- and life and laughter keep breaking in. In the middle of July Pepys shares a water-taxi with a stranger, a ""man of love to Musique"", and they ""sung together all the way down- with great pleasure"". That evening he ""dined well, and mighty merry"". After all the gaiety, he curtly records: ""Above 700 dead of the plague this week.""
As the months pass, his anxiety rises. He worries about catching a cold and about a servant's headache. He ponders the plague's impact on the vogue for the ""periwig"" (he has not worn his new one for fear of catching someone else's lice). He walks through a changed London: ""But Lord, how empty the streets are, and melancholy.""
This uncanny sense of a city sliding from familiar to strange recurs in the diaries George Orwell kept during the second world war. ""Huge areas of London almost normal,"" he observes as the Blitz begins in September 1940, ""and everyone quite happy in the daytime..."" Four days later, though, he finds Oxford Street empty of traffic and almost deserted, ""the late afternoon sun shining straight down the empty roadway and glittering on innumerable fragments of broken glass"".
War is not a precise parallel for pandemics, however fond today's politicians are of martial rhetoric. But war diaries such as Orwell's are full of moments that resonate now. ""As soon as war started the carrying or not carrying of a gas mask assumed social and political implications,"" he writes in June 1940, though he might have been talking about masks in the age of covid. ""You are still a little stared at if you carry one without being in uniform."" Or take the day in July when he sees a heron flying over Baker Street: ""I suppose it is possible that the war, ie the diminution of traffic, tends to increase bird life in inner London.""
Life to lead
The wartime diaries of Astrid Lindgren, author of ""Pippi Longstocking"", highlight the shortages and terror of invasion that gripped even neutral Sweden-and the challenges of motherhood when you have to worry about feeding and entertaining children. Lindgren worked as a censor, learned about overseas atrocities early, and worried that they would happen in Sweden, too. After opening letters describing starvation in Belgium and France she writes: ""It makes one feel quite hopeless, sitting at work and reading them.""
In many war diaries there is an uneasy tension between headline events and personal tribulations. ""Not much news"", Orwell writes, ""ie only events of worldwide importance. "" Three years into the war Lindgren recalls how ""we used to talk about it all the time; now we see it as a necessary evil, to be thought of and talked about as little as possible."" By contrast, in the diaries of Derek Jarman, a British film-maker and artist, the personal and the political fuse.
Jarman began his diaries, published in two volumes as ""Modern Nature"" and ""Smiling in Slow Motion"", soon after learning he was Hiv-positive, and just before he revealed the diagnosis publicly. Behind the tally of days, weeks and months runs an undercurrent of mortality-a fate that many people, even if they know their death is close, try to ignore. Jarman faces the ultimate, inevitable adversary head on.
His record of his last five years is angry, beautiful and haunting by turns. As he grapples with the effects of the disease and the attendant hospital visits, he records the stigma Hiv-positive people faced in the 1980s and 1990s, brilliantly articulating the mental toll of a physical illness: ""I'm less alive. There's less life to lead. I can't give 100% attention to anything-part of me is always thinking about my health.""
In ""Modern Nature"", which begins in 1989, he reflects on his life as a gay man in London in the 1960s and 1970s, his childhood, the experience of living with a scourge that would kill many close friends, and on things which give him pleasure- including his partner, ""HB"", and his garden at Prospect Cottage in Dungeness:
Behind the façade my life is at sixes and sevens. I water the roses and wonder whether I will see them bloom. I plant my herbal garden as a panacea, read up on all the aches and pains that plants will cure-and know they are not going to help.Yet there is a thrill in watching the plants spring up that gives me hope.
Just as Woolf found a spell of respite in the landscape of Sussex, so Jarman's brightly coloured shingle garden is a place where he can find peace.
Diaries can show people at their messiest (even if they are intended for publication, as Jarman's were). At the best of times people are anxious, lonely, bitter, prejudiced, annoyed and confused. Encompassing all these feelings, diaries can be as expansive and gripping as fiction. They display the best and worst sides of their writers; they show readers that they are not alone in feeling scared or miserable. And reading the lives of others suggests that, even at times of crisis and distress, it is possible to find and grasp moments of joy.","Solidarity in reading

In contrast to most of Europe and America, still buffeted by covid-19, swathes of East Asia and the Pacific have climbed through the worst of the turbulence and can glimpse blue skies again. Testing and tracing, prompt social distancing and swiftly mobilised healthcare systems have brought impressive results: Vietnam claims no deaths, Hong Kong only four and Taiwan just seven. Japan has brought new daily infections down below 40 and has lifted a state of emergency. Local transmission is close to or at zero in Hong Kong, where offices and schools have reopened, South Korea, Taiwan, Vietnam and, of course, China. Down Under, Australia and New Zealand are also blinking in the sunlight.
But the ascent to blue skies remains purely metaphorical. As economies start to normalise, the glaring exception is international air travel. When Banyan recently returned on one of only two flights a day from Tokyo to Hong Kong, where he is resident, crew outnumbered passengers. On his last evening in Japan, when an Airbus flew over the neighbourhood, a thousand heads craned in awe to see it. At Hong Kong airport, every scrap of apron is taken up with Cathay Pacific's grounded fleet.
The pressing question is how to restart international travel safely. Compulsory two-week quarantines, such as the one for returning Hong Kongers, are unfeasible for tourists and business travellers. One answer is ""bubbles"" or ""air bridges"" joining jurisdictions that have all but banished the virus and believe in each other's testing and honesty. But setting them up is far from simple.
Australia and New Zealand lead the way with a proposed ""covid-safe travel zone"", better known as the trans-Tasman bubble. It should make a big difference. Tourism used to generate a fifth of New Zealand's foreign earnings, and the 1.5m Australians who travelled across the ditch last year made up nearly half of all visitors. Kiwis flocked the other way, too, visiting families and friends. Winston Peters, New Zealand's deputy prime minister, hopes the bubble will be running in time for the looming ski season. Ann Sherry, co-chair of the Australia New Zealand Leadership Forum, thinks a trial might be ready for the school holidays in July.
The devil is in the details. New Zealand is close to eliminating covid-19. Australia's ""aggressive suppression"" is still finding a few new cases daily. There is no decision yet on whether local transmissions should be quashed completely before trans-Tasman travel can resume. Meanwhile, confusion reigns over a hodgepodge of different rules across Australia's eight states and territories. Some, such as Queensland, ban incoming travellers; others force them to quarantine for 14 days. New Zealand's prime minister, Jacinda Ardern, says ""it matters"" whether travellers can move freely once inside Australia. Another snafu involves the smartphone apps both countries use for contact tracing-how to get them to talk to each other? Not easy, says Jill Slay, a cyber-security expert at La Trobe University.
Whether the bubble can be expanded quickly is also unclear. Small countries in the Pacific including Fiji and the Cook Islands, which have kept the virus at bay, are keen to join. Many islanders live and work in Australia and New Zealand, which in turn supply a big chunk of the tourists who are the islands' other main source of cash. But Pacific countries worry that Australian tourists might bring the disease with them. They lack testing facilities. Workers may be allowed to travel first.
Other covid-conquerors such as Hong Kong, South Korea and Taiwan would like to enter the bubble. But working out all the necessary protocols could take months or years and could be derailed by a second wave of infections. Other approaches are being discussed. Singapore proposes ""green lane"" arrangements with a handful of countries with equivalent or lower risks of community transmission. The travel would have to be essential, and numbers strictly limited.
Meanwhile, Taiwan is pioneering work with Stanford University, first reported by the Financial Times, to create a ""safe-travel protocol"". Next month 500 human guinea pigs will travel from San Francisco to Taipei. Passengers will be tested before a preflight period of quarantine. They will then be tested every two days in quarantine when they land. The aim is to find the shortest safe quarantine period for brief business trips, rather than the typical two weeks. But for anything other than essential travel, the regime is no bundle of fun: more decompression chamber than bubble.","Asian travel ""bubbles"" will not be as carefree as they sound

SYDNEY
The man who attacked two mosques in New Zealand last year is sentenced
THE WHITE supremacist who murdered 51 Muslims in Christchurch in March last year expressed only one regret: that he had not been able to kill more. The mass shooting, which he live-streamed on Facebook, was the worst in New Zealand's history. Its courts had never sentenced anyone to life in prison without parole. But on August 27th a judge ruled that Brenton Tarrant should spend the rest of his life in jail.
""Anything less would have been a disappointment to most New Zealanders, says Paul Spoonley of Massey University. The attack forced the country to re-examine its reputation as an open and harmonious place. ""Ever since, he says, ""we've been looking for a degree of resolution.
Survivors were spared a drawn-out trial because Mr Tarrant, an Australian, pleaded guilty to all 51 counts of murder, 40 of attempted murder and one of terrorism. Still, Kiwis worried that he might make a spectacle of the four-day hearing on his sentence. The killer had sacked his lawyers and was representing himself. He had already inspired copycats in other countries. How could he be prevented from using his trial as a grandstand?
The High Court's answer was to bar live reporting from the hearing. As it happened, Mr Tarrant was silent. The stand was given mostly to survivors of the attacks and relatives of the victims. Some 90 of them read statements about how his crimes had affected them. Several showed extraordinary grace. Janna Ezat described receiving her son's body, with the skull smashed open and brain still bleeding, before explaining that her Muslim faith gave her ""only one choice: to forgive you.
Jacinda Ardern, the prime minister, asserts that New Zealand has ""fundamentally changed since the massacre. She banned semi-automatic weapons in the days that followed the attack. By Christmas, the government had bought back more than 56,000 firearms and 200,000 illegal gun parts in an amnesty. It is not clear how many Kiwis have kept guns, though, because the law has only just been amended to create a register.
Families are still waiting for other promised changes. Plans to broaden hatespeech laws to include religion have been resisted on free-speech grounds by New Zealand First, the coalition partner of Ms Ardern's Labour Party. A royal commission is investigating whether the authorities could have prevented the attacks. In a submission to the inquiry, the Islamic Women's Council of New Zealand noted that the security services had been warned about the growing threat of Islamophobia. If those complaints had been taken seriously, it asserted, Mr Tarrant might not ""have got to the door of the mosques.
Still, Muslims seem inclined to agree with the prime minister. ""New Zealand before 15th March is not New Zealand after 15th March, says Gamal Fouda, an imam of one of the mosques that was attacked.

Polls suggest a fairy-tale outcome for the incumbent prime minister
JACINDA ardern's staff ran into a problem after she declared New Zealand free of the coronavirus in June. It was impossible to keep the prime minister on schedule, they griped, because she was constantly mobbed by supporters. Patrons jumped up to applaud her when she went out for dinner. Passers-by hung out of car windows to yell their thanks. At the convention of her party, Labour, one eulogiser declared her ""our nation's saviour"".
Even after a modest resurgence of the disease, New Zealanders continued to commend Ms Ardern for averting the worst. She closed their borders to foreigners and rallied a ""team of 5m"" (ie, everyone in the country) to support one of the toughest lockdowns in the world. As a result, New Zealand has seen only 25 deaths from covid-19. Many voters, says Ben Thomas, a former government staffer under the opposition National Party, feel that Ms Ardern has ""literally saved them"".
All this puts the prime minister on track for a big victory in an election on October 17th. The latest polls suggest that Labour may win 47% of the vote, which would give it 59 seats in the unicameral parliament. It needs 61 seats in the 120-seat chamber for an outright majority-a feat never achieved since New Zealand adopted a proportional voting system in 1996.
Either way, Ms Ardern will be in a far stronger parliamentary position than she is now. Labour actually lost the most recent election, in 2017, securing just 46 seats to National's 56. Ms Ardern was able to form a government only with the support of New Zealand First, a populist party. Even then, she needed backing from the Greens, not formally part of the coalition.
This time around, New Zealand First is unlikely to win any seats: it is polling well below the 5% minimum needed to guarantee a seat in parliament. Ms Ardern will not be losing any sleep about that. Winston Peters, New Zealand First's leader, has obstructed her plans on everything from stronger hate-speech laws to a capitalgains tax. If Ms Ardern falls short of a majority, she will find a more compliant coalition partner in the Greens. Together, they might form the first wholly left-wing coalition to run the country in 20 years.
What makes such a prospect all the more striking is that, before the pandemic, Ms Ardern was on track to lose the election. She came into office with lofty plans to ""build a fairer, better New Zealand"" by reducing child poverty, ending homelessness and erecting ioo,ooo cheap houses- none of which she has managed to do. She is lauded overseas for her forthright defence of immigrants after a massacre at two mosques in Christchurch in 2019, as well as for her upbeat, no-nonsense demeanour, especially regarding her pregnancy and maternity leave while in office. Many New Zealanders, however, used to grumble that she had achieved little of substance. ""On almost every front, this government has been a failure,"" says Oliver Hartwich of the New Zealand Initiative, a think-tank.
New Zealand's rebuffing of covid-19 has put paid to that complaint. It helps, too, that the opposition has been in turmoil. National has churned through three leaders since May, and several of its senior mps have resigned. Its latest boss, Judith ""Crusher"" Collins, is trying to look even tougher than Ms Ardern on the virus. She complains that the government allowed covid-19 back into New Zealand because it did not test officials who came into contact with returning travellers. National would guard the borders more fiercely, she says.
National typically relies on votes from people who worry about the economy, which is in recession. To pep it up, Ms Collins pledges to cut income tax temporarily, returning NZ$3,000 ($2,000) to middle-income earners. But she undermined her own credibility on the subject by releasing an ""alternative budget"" which was subsequently found to include accounting errors of as much as NZ$8bn (2.5% of gdp). In contrast, the finance minister, Grant Robertson, has won acclaim by spending carefully before the pandemic, and then creating a popular wage-subsidy scheme. Polling suggests that Kiwis now have more faith in Labour than National to steer the economy.
If things go well for Ms Ardern, it might follow that she would pursue a more radical agenda. Some right-wing voters shudder at the thought of what she could do if unshackled from a relatively conservative partner. Yet Labour's policies are far less ambitious than last time round. The most contentious is a plan to increase income taxes. It applies only to people earning more than NZ$i8o,ooo-the top 2%-and even then at a rate of 39%, much lower than in many rich countries. This points to a potential conundrum. Ms Ardern positioned herself as a transforming leader. But to win enough seats to bring about sweeping change, she must secure votes from centrists who are wary of grandiose ideas. The more successful she becomes, the less radical she is likely to be.","Elections in New Zealand 
 SYDNEY 
 Polls suggest a fairy - tale outcome for Jacinda Ardern's staff ran into a problem after Jacinda Ardern declared New Zealand free of the coronavirus in June . It was impossible to keep Jacinda Ardern on schedule , they griped , because Jacinda Ardern was constantly mobbed by supporters . Patrons jumped up to applaud Jacinda Ardern when Jacinda Ardern went out for dinner . Passers - by hung out of car windows to yell their thanks . At the convention of Jacinda Ardern's party , Labour , one eulogiser declared Jacinda Ardern "" our nation 's saviour "" . 
 Even after a modest resurgence of the disease , New Zealanders continued to commend Jacinda Ardern for averting the worst . Jacinda Ardern closed their borders to foreigners and rallied a "" team of 5 m "" ( ie , everyone in the country ) to support one of the toughest lockdowns in the world . As a result , New Zealand has seen only 25 deaths from covid-19 . Many voters , says Ben Thomas , a former government staffer under the opposition National Party , feel that Jacinda Ardern has "" literally saved them "" . 
 All this puts Jacinda Ardern on track for a big victory in an election on October 17th . The latest polls suggest that Labour may win 47 % of the vote , which would give it 59 seats in the unicameral parliament . It needs 61 seats in the 120 - seat chamber for an outright majority - a feat never achieved since New Zealand adopted a proportional voting system in 1996 .

A victorious Jacinda Ardern must deal with covid's economic fallout
SYDNEY
Everyone knew that the Labour Party would win. But even its leader, Jacinda Ardern, seemed startled by its landslide victory in New Zealand's general election on October 17th. Ballots must still be counted from prisoners and expats, but so far Labour has mopped up 49% of the vote, compared with 27% for the main opposition, the conservative National Party. New Zealand's proportional voting system is designed to curb the power of big parties, by making it hard for them to govern without smaller coalition partners. Yet with an absolute majority in parliament (64 seats out of 120), Labour will be able to do just that.
Although she does not need them, the prime minister is now in talks with the Green Party's ten mps, to find what she calls ""areas of potential co-operation"". They might not enter teha full-blown coalition, but the pair could form a looser partnership whereby the Greens vote with the government on certain issues, in return for a ministerial portfolio or two, says Neale Jones, Ms Ardern's former chief of staff. The Greens' co-leader, James Shaw, was climate-change minister in the last government. One idea is that he could be re-appointed to that post. Such an arrangement would have the appeal of keeping criticism at bay. What is more, Labour has lots of ministerial jobs to fill, now that it has a parliamentary majority. Many of its mps are rookies, so experienced Greens could help fill the ranks.
Ms Ardern, New Zealand's most popular leader in generations (and one of the world's most popular-see chart) has avoided debate about what happens next. Her upbeat campaign focused on how well her previous government, a coalition with a populist party, New Zealand First, kept the pandemic at bay. New Zealand has all but suppressed local transmission of the virus, allowing Kiwis to have fun in crowds-a day after the election, 46,000 fans squished into a stadium to watch the All Blacks, the national rugby team, thrash Australia. But this does not mean that the country is immune to the economic symptoms of covid-19.
New Zealand's small economy depends on the outside world. Since its borders closed in March, the foreign students and immigrants who power its growth have been shut out. The loss of tourists, who are normally its biggest source of export earnings, is devastating resort towns such as Queenstown. A wage subsidy, which saved vulnerable jobs in hospitality and retail, has just dried up. The government predicts that unemployment will almost double to 7.7% in the year ahead.
Kiwis strongly support their state of isolation. Although Ms Ardern intends to let in a trickle of ""critical workers"" and graduate students-and perhaps, at some point, visitors from Australia-government modelling suggests New Zealand will be closed until early 2022. Labour insists that it has other ideas to get the economy moving. The problem, says Jennifer Curtin, a political scientist at Auckland University, is that no one is quite sure what they are.
The party's 29-page manifesto was released just four days before the vote. It vows to create jobs by investing in critical infrastructure. There will be more loans for small firms, and a NZ$3iim ($206m) subsidy for companies which hire the jobless. To critics, this all seems rather bitsy. They gripe that Ms Ardern is better at making people feel warm and fuzzy than turning policies into action. In her first term plans for everything from a capital-gains tax to a light railway in Auckland fell flat.
Back then Labour was able to blame, often fairly, its conservative coalition partner for such failures. Now it bears sole responsibility. Left-wing voters will expect Ms Ardern to do something big about poverty and inequality-problems which she promised, but failed, to tackle in her first term. However, the conservative voters she has just won over will be wary of sweeping changes to tax or welfare. Ms Ardern promises to govern ""for all New Zealanders"". But she cannot please everyone. *","New Zealand 's election

UNTIL THIS week, Asia's most famous ministerial tattoo belonged to the Indonesian former fisheries minister, Susi Pudjiastuti. But you had to know where to look-the birdlike form lived on Ms Susi's shin. In contrast, New Zealand's new foreign minister, Nanaia Mahuta, sports a Maori tattoo known as a moko kauae on her lips and chin.
Ms Mahuta is part of the most diverse cabinet in New Zealand's history, appointed by Jacinda Ardern following a thumping re-election for the prime minister and the Labour Party she leads. Ethnically, almost half the 20 members are not pakeha, ie, white, including five indigenous Maori. There are eight women, two of whom are lesbians with young children, and the first openly gay deputy prime minister, Grant Robertson.
Ms Ardern would not, this week, have fared well in Kansas. After a massacre of Muslim worshippers last year, she swiftly implemented a ban on semi-automatic weapons. Climate change and the environment are big priorities. She likes to talk about her ""team of 5m"", meaning all Kiwis. Vogue magazine nicknamed her the ""anti-Trump"".
Yet the prime minister's liberal stances are not so much shaping the country's attitudes as emblematic of them. New Zealand, after all, was the first place in the world to give women the vote. The country is content, even occasionally smug, about being so very progressive. As Andrew Geddis of the University of Otago says of Ms Mahuta's moko kauae, New Zealand's public face ""says something about how we're changing as a society and what we're comfortable with showing the world"".
More notable than the appearance of Ms Ardern's cabinet is how voters answered one question on their ballot paper: should New Zealand legalise assisted dying for those with a terminal illness? Though the final tally has yet to be announced, around two-thirds of New Zealanders appear to have said ""yes"".
Dying with dignity has been the subject of heated debate for years. Voluntary euthanasia has had the support of libertarians, notably David Seymour, who heads the act party, as much as of more leftleaning types. In 2015 Lecretia Seales, a lawyer with a terminal brain tumour, sued the government for the right to die. She lost, but after her death her husband redoubled the campaign. A national debate ensued, in which lawmakers looked to see what worked in other countries.
Last year Parliament passed the End of Life Choice Act. It restricts access to assisted dying more than some European legislation. It requires you to be suffering from a terminal illness that is likely to end your life within six months, to be showing a significant decline in physical capability and to be able to make an informed decision. Arguments that the law would result in disabled people, the mentally ill or even children being put to death never gained traction. The law's enactment was contingent on the referendum, which was binding. New Zealand thus becomes only the seventh country to legalise assisted dying, and the first country in Asia- though the Australian state of Victoria passed a similar law last year.
Yet when it came to another, nonbinding, question on their ballots, about whether to legalise cannabis, Kiwis curiously found limits to their openmindedness: just over half appear to have voted against the proposition. That might seem strange. New Zealand is one of the easiest places in the world to get a toke, and Ms Ardern's admission of having smoked weed elicited little more than a national shrug. More than half of those aged between 15 and 45 say they've done the same.
Still, as Lara Greaves of the University of Auckland, puts it, full legalisation of cannabis, rather than its simple decriminalisation, was ""a jump too far"". Some feared that making more available would only further encourage its use, especially among the young. Moreover, said anticannabis campaigners, a problem already exists with heavy alcohol consumption, especially among Maori and Pacific-islanders-why add to it? Besides, who is going to get locked up just for smoking a joint?
Such arguments are understandable. But they miss a point that Maori community workers and others make: Maori are far more likely than pakeha to be charged with possession and cultivation of marijuana. And the disproportionate number of Maori banged up for small-fry drug offences feeds into the pathology of Maori gangs that blight indigenous life. Even the most progressive societies have their blind spots.","New Zealand legalises assisted dying , among other progressive steps

 Jacinda Ardern would not , this week , have fared well in Kansas . After a massacre of Muslim worshippers last year , Jacinda Ardern swiftly implemented a ban on semi - automatic weapons . Climate change and the environment are big priorities . Jacinda Ardern likes to talk about Jacinda Ardern's "" team of 5 m "" , meaning all Kiwis . Vogue magazine nicknamed Jacinda Ardern the "" anti - Trump "" . 
 Yet Jacinda Ardern's liberal stances are not so much shaping the country 's attitudes as emblematic of them . New Zealand , after all , was the first place in the world to give women the vote . The country is content , even occasionally smug , about being so very progressive . As Andrew Geddis of the University of Otago says of Ms Mahuta 's moko kauae , New Zealand 's public face "" says something about how we 're changing as a society and what we 're comfortable with showing the world "" . 
 More notable than the appearance of Jacinda Ardern's cabinet is how voters answered one question on their ballot paper : should New Zealand legalise assisted dying for those with a terminal illness ? Though the final tally has yet to be announced , around two - thirds of New Zealanders appear to have said "" yes "" . 
 Dying with dignity has been the subject of heated debate for years . Voluntary euthanasia has had the support of libertarians , notably David Seymour , who heads the act party , as much as of more leftleaning types . In 2015 Lecretia Seales , a lawyer with a terminal brain tumour , sued the government for the right to die . She lost , but after her death her husband redoubled the campaign . A national debate ensued , in which lawmakers looked to see what worked in other countries . 
 Last year Parliament passed the End of Life Choice Act . It restricts access to assisted dying more than some European legislation . It requires you to be suffering from a terminal illness that is likely to end your life within six months , to be showing a significant decline in physical capability and to be able to make an informed decision . Arguments that the law would result in disabled people , the mentally ill or even children being put to death never gained traction . The law 's enactment was contingent on the referendum , which was binding . New Zealand thus becomes only the seventh country to legalise assisted dying , and the first country in Asia- though the Australian state of Victoria passed a similar law last year . 
 Yet when it came to another , nonbinding , question on their ballots , about whether to legalise cannabis , Kiwis curiously found limits to their openmindedness : just over half appear to have voted against the proposition . That might seem strange . New Zealand is one of the easiest places in the world to get a toke , and Jacinda Ardern's admission of having smoked weed elicited little more than a national shrug . More than half of those aged between 15 and 45 say they 've done the same . 
 Still , as Lara Greaves of the University of Auckland , puts it , full legalisation of cannabis , rather than its simple decriminalisation , was "" a jump too far "" . Some feared that making more available would only further encourage its use , especially among the young . Moreover , said anticannabis campaigners , a problem already exists with heavy alcohol consumption , especially among Maori and Pacific - islanders - why add to it ? Besides , who is going to get locked up just for smoking a joint ? 
 Such arguments are understandable . But they miss a point that Maori community workers and others make : Maori are far more likely than pakeha to be charged with possession and cultivation of marijuana . And the disproportionate number of Maori banged up for small - fry drug offences feeds into the pathology of Maori gangs that blight indigenous life . Even the most progressive societies have their blind spots .",920,New Zealand,se-920-2,IN TERM,True,Jacinda Ardern,11,True

The Economist's annual award for most-improved country
In most years most countries improve in various ways. In 2020, however, premature death and economic contraction became the new normal, and most countries aspired only to dodge the worst of it. Inevitably, our shortlist of most-improved countries includes some that merely avoided regressing much.
Few people would argue that life in New Zealand was better in 2020 than in 2019. But the virus has been contained. When only 100 cases had been detected, the prime minister, Jacinda Ardern, closed the borders, locked down the country and urged its ""team of 5m"" (ie, the whole population) to be kind to each other. Only 25 Kiwis have died and life has more or less returned to normal. Rugby stadiums finished the season packed with fans. The amiable Ms Ardern was re-elected with a majority in a country where such things are almost unheard of.
Taiwan has done even better, with only seven deaths and a far stronger economic performance. Leave aside whether Taiwan is a country or merely a contender for ""de facto self-governing territory of the year"". It kept the virus at bay without closing schools, shops or restaurants, much less imposing lockdowns. Its economy is one of the few expected to have grown in 2020. It also showed courage, refusing to back down despite relentless threats from Beijing. China's government often says that Taiwan must be reunited with the mainland. It has been sending warships and fighter jets ever closer to the island, ever more often. Yet in January Taiwanese voters spurned a presidential candidate who favoured warmer ties with China and re-elected Tsai Ing-wen, whose government has been sheltering democracy activists from Hong Kong. Taiwan is a constant reminder that Chinese culture is perfectly compatible with liberal democracy.
These achievements are impressive. However, the pandemic is not yet over and to judge a country on its covid-fighting record is to focus on specific forms of good governance when circumstances of geography and genes make comparisons hard. Being an island helps. Some populations may have immunity to coronaviruses. So it is worth considering other candidates.
The United States did almost as badly as Britain, Italy and Spain in its response to covid-19, but its Operation Warp Speed was central to bringing about a vaccine in record time. And by rejecting President Donald Trump in November, American voters did their bit to curb the spread of populism-another global scourge. Mr Trump's efforts to overturn the will of those voters were unprecedented for a sitting president, but the judges he appointed were loyal to the law, not the man who picked them.
Voters in Bolivia, too, restored a measure of normality. After a fraud-tainted election, the overthrow of a socialist president, violent protests and the vengeful, incompetent rule of an interim president, the Andean nation held a peaceful re-run ballot in October and picked a technocrat, Luis Arce.
But this year's prize goes to a country in southern Africa. Democracy and respect for human rights regressed in 80 countries between the start of the pandemic and September, reckons Freedom House, a think-tank. The only place where they improved was Malawi.
To appreciate its progress, consider what came before. In 2012 a president died, his death was covered up and his corpse flown to South Africa for ""medical treatment"", to buy time so that his brother could take over. That brother, Peter Mutharika, failed to grab power then but was elected two years later and ran for reelection. The vote-count was rigged with correction fluid on the tally sheets. Foreign observers cynically approved it anyway. Malawians launched mass protests against the ""Tipp-Ex election"". Malawian judges turned down suitcases of bribes and annulled it. A fair re-run in June booted out Mr Mutharika and installed the people's choice, Lazarus Chakwera. Malawi is still poor, but its people are citizens, not subjects. For reviving democracy in an authoritarian region, it is our country of the year. *","Country of the year

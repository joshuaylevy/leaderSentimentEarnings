Until the next election in September zool, the 165 representatives of the people must make the best of botched job. 
The ruling left-of-centre Labour Party lost just two seats and less than two percentage points of the vote. Nevertheless, it looks as if Labour will bow out of power. Thorbjorn Jagland, the luckless prime minister, tied his hands in August by promising to resign if Labour did not win at least the same share of the vote as in 1993. The gamble nearly paid off. As voters contemplated the alternatives, Labour recovered from a dismal 27% in the opinion polls to win 35% of the vote and 65 seats, more than twice as many as the next biggest party. Yet Mr Jagland plans to resign after putting a budget to parliament on October 13th. 
The first crack at forming a coalition will therefore go to an amiable nonentity, Kjell Magne Bondevik, leader of the middle-of-the-road Christian People's Party, which made big gains. But with whom might he govern? His alliance with the Centre (which lost ground) and the right-wing (in economics) Liberal parties (which gained) looks weak-and only gives a coalition led by Mr Bondevik a bare quarter of the votes in parliament, less than Labour on its own. He must therefore look elsewhere, at least for tacit support. 
That could come from the Conservative Party, which hints that it will back, at least at first, a minority government of the centre. But for how long? The pro-EU Conservatives say they will support a government only if it manages to keep Norway in a freetrade area with the EU and signs the EU'S open-border agreement. The Centre Party, which in 1994 led the campaign against joining the European club, is fiercely against both. 
The only other party strong enough to support a centre-right coalition-the populist Progress Party-is deemed beyond the pale and, in any event, is not interested. Its leader, Carl I. Hagen, is sometimes compared to Jean-Marie Le Pen, France's leading right-wing xenophobe, though the Norwegian is much milder. He nearly tripled his party's vote (to 15%) by calling for tighter asylum laws and playing on the disappointment of voters who could not understand why a country rolling in cash from oil and gas should have queues for medical treatment, pensioners on pittances and schools short of computers and textbooks. 
But Mr Hagen reckons, probably rightly, that his party can get more of what it wants by manipulating a hung parliament. He gives the impression he would rather deal with Labour's pretty competent ministers than with the neophytes the other parties are likely to put forward. If Mr Bondevik's shaky partnership collapses after a few weeks, Labour, which refuses to build coalitions, could be back. 
Any government may be hard pressed to resist the appeal of some of Mr Hagen's populist ideas. The oil and gas money pouring into a fund against the day when the wells run dry is a tempting target, but raiding it would be risky. With unemployment at below 4%, any extra stimulus could spark inflation and higher interest rates, jeopardising growth. Mr Bondevik and Mr Jagland, the two possible prime ministers, both see danger. Will the new parliament let either of them swerve away from it?

WILL Norway's government fall, along with its dipping currency? The coalition government which took office last October was bound to be weak, since it has just 42 of parliament's 165 seats. But it is led by a popular prime minister, Kjell Magne Bondevik, a Lutheran priest and ardent football fan. That, though, may not be enough to keep it afloat. Plainly, Mr Bondevik's Christian People's Party does not get on with its partners, the rural Centre Party and the free-market Liberals. And this awkward trio evidently lacks enough savvy people to run a sound government. 
Now Norway is paying the price. Mr Bondevik's team ignored the country's central bank, which had pleaded with it to tighten fiscal policy to stop the economy overheating. But slumping oil prices have triggered speculation against the Norwegian krone and the bank is having to shove up interest rates in an effort to fend off a feared burst of inflation. Since most mortgage payments are pegged to short-term interest rates, Norwegian mortgage-holders will be clobbered almost immediately. And the government's promises of ample public spending will have to be broken. Before the krone's fall, a fat budget surplus of 8% of GDP was predicted-and ministers jeered at the central bank's call for fiscal restraint. Now government frugality may have to replace profligacy. 
Perhaps it was inevitable that the government's inherent weakness would soon be exposed, given the thinness of its base in parliament. For some time, Mr Bondevik's crew have been administering rather than governing. Parliament, it seems, has been making the running. And, though most Norwegians still like Mr Bondevik, he lacks the political muscle to call his legislature to heel. In Norway, parliaments cannot be dissolved between general elections, which can be held only every four years. So Mr Bondevik cannot call parliament's bluff by demanding a fresh poll. 
Whether he stays in office depends largely on Carl I. Hagen, who runs the rightwing, populist Progress Party, which shocked liberal Norwegians last year by winning 15% of the vote-its best performance ever. And to the dismay of left-wingers in the ruling coalition, Mr Bondevik quite often finds himself turning for help to Mr Hagen and another right-wing party, the Conservatives, when his coalition is floundering in parliament. 
This delights the wily Mr Hagen, who has become adept at bargaining for his supporters. He has persuaded Mr Bondevik to dish out extra money, for instance, to pensioners. But when parliament returns from its summer recess, things may be different. Forced to tighten the purse-strings to let interest rates fall, Mr Bondevik may no longer be able to pay off Mr Hagen for his help. At which point Mr Hagen, so he has been hinting, might switch his support to the Labour Party, which ruled the country for most of the 12 years before Mr Bondevik took over. 
Is Mr Hagen, whose reputation is for xenophobia and opportunism, becoming the country's kingmaker? That is just what most Norwegians of the centre-left and centre-right-the majority of voters-have been dreading. Because of an ill-managed currency, it may be coming to that. ","Norway 
 WILL Norway 's government fall , along with its dipping currency ? The coalition government which took office last October was bound to be weak , since it has just 42 of parliament 's 165 seats . But it is led by Kjell Bondevik . That , though , may not be enough to keep it afloat . Plainly , Kjell Bondevik's Christian People 's Party does not get on with its partners , the rural Centre Party and the free - market Liberals . And this awkward trio evidently lacks enough savvy people to run a sound government . 
 Now Norway is paying the price . Kjell Bondevik's team ignored the country 's central bank , which had pleaded with it to tighten fiscal policy to stop the economy overheating . But slumping oil prices have triggered speculation against the Norwegian krone and the bank is having to shove up interest rates in an effort to fend off a feared burst of inflation . Since most mortgage payments are pegged to short - term interest rates , Norwegian mortgage - holders will be clobbered almost immediately . And the government 's promises of ample public spending will have to be broken . Before the krone 's fall , a fat budget surplus of 8 % of GDP was predicted - and ministers jeered at the central bank 's call for fiscal restraint . Now government frugality may have to replace profligacy . 
 Perhaps it was inevitable that the government 's inherent weakness would soon be exposed , given the thinness of its base in parliament . For some time , Kjell Bondevik's crew have been administering rather than governing . Parliament , it seems , has been making the running . And , though most Norwegians still like Kjell Bondevik , Kjell Bondevik lacks the political muscle to call Kjell Bondevik's legislature to heel . In Norway , parliaments can not be dissolved between general elections , which can be held only every four years . So Kjell Bondevik can not call parliament 's bluff by demanding a fresh poll . 
 Whether Kjell Bondevik stays in office depends largely on Carl I.

FALLING interest rates, collapsing confidence and sluggish activity all command the attention of economic policy makers. Seen in people rather than countries or markets, though, the same symptoms cause much less of a stir. That's why there is so little outcry about the fact that there are 330m people around the world suffering from depression, 90% of whom won't get adequate treatment. The disease afflicts more people than heart disease-far more than AIDS-and most cases are not even diagnosed. If this were a disease of the body, an environmentally caused cancer or an infectious epidemic, these figures would be at the centre of outraged campaigns around the world. But because depression is a slippery, silent illness, few cry out. 
In many ways, depression is a disease like any other. Something in the outside world affects some aspect of the body's make-up and a normally healthy process becomes a problem. In cancer, it is growth that goes awry, spreading uncontrolled as the body's checks and balances break down. In depression, it is a feeling that runs amok. As a cancer is a malignant growth, so depression is a malignant sadness, to borrow the title of a forthcoming book on the subject by Lewis Wolpert, a British biologist who has had the disease. Modem bio-medicine has tracked both cancer and depression back towards their molecular roots; but, as yet, the world's burden of suffering in both cases has been eased only a little. 
In the case of depression, though, there is a further dimension to the problem. Tumorous growths can be seen, scanned, perhaps excised; malignant sadness can only be felt. The bit of the body that malfunctions in depression is the one which produces feelings and thoughts; depression is real but it is also subjective. And as a disease of the mind it is terribly sensitive to the attitudes people have towards it. In most of the world those attitudes are negative, dismissive or-most widely-profoundly ignorant of the very possibility that such feelings can usefully be seen as a disease. 
Global gloom 
On a warm, sunny day in Geneva, Christopher Murray, head of epidemiology at the World Health Organisation, draws down his office blinds. It's too bright outside for the gloomy projections within. According to Dr Murray, unipolar major depression will be the world's second most debilitating disease by 2020. In terms of the number of years of productive life lost to disability it will be surpassed only by cardiovascular disease. This prediction comes from projecting current rates of disease on to a demographic model of the world to come. In 20 the population will be older, and thus more likely to be hit by depression. But the prediction may be an underestimate. Current rates of depression are known imprecisely; what's more, it is possible that the incidence is actually growing. If, as some argue, depression is a disease of modernity and its stresses, development will increase its sway. And it seems that, in America, younger people are developing more depression earlier on in life (see chart). 
There is at present no blood exam, no urine test, no scan that can tell you if someone is suffering from depression. So doctors rely on checklists of symptoms, most commonly those of America's Diagnostic and Statistical Manual. According to the DSM, depression comes in 39 different flavours and three sizes: mild, moderate and severe. Major unipolar depression, the one rising quickly through Dr Murray's rankings, is distinguished by at least two consecutive weeks of low mood and little pleasure, along with a combination of weight fluctuation, sleep disturbance, fatigue, poor concentration, guilt or low self-esteem and suicidal thoughts. 
Using these tests epidemiologists have found that rates of major depression throughout the world range between 4% and 10% of the population, and the lifetime prevalence"" of the condition-the chance of developing it at some point-runs between lo% and 20%. The WHO is planning a study of 100,000 people in 15 countries that should pin down the extent of depression and other psychiatric conditions more firmly. 
This is the picture as seen by epidemiologists using specific tools to look for depression. Doctors in the field don't see it that way, in part because they start from what the patient tells them. Patients are not very good at knowing they're depressed and worse at telling other people, in large part because, consciously or unconsciously, they fear the stigma that is commonly attached to the disease. They tend to just say that they feel ill in various ways""somatising"" the depression into a set of bodily symptoms, which doctors try and treat as bodily ailments, to little if any effect. Different cultures and traditions produce different somatisations. 
In 198o Arthur Kleinman, professor of psychiatry and anthropology at Harvard University, visited a hospital in Hunan, China, with DsM in hand. He found that 87% of those suffering from shenjing shuairuo, a fairly common condition characterised by dizziness, fatigue and headache, were in American terms suffering from depression. Treated with anti-depressants, rather than the assortment of anti-anxiety drugs and herbal remedies they usually received, the patients did better. Although they initially resisted the change, China's psychiatrists now embrace the new diagnosis, along with the DsM (though this may be just because they want to publish their research in American medical journals). But China still reports 200 times less major depression than America. The idea of depression has yet to be accepted: ""Ask many Chinese if they're depressed, and they simply don't understand what you mean by the word,"" according to Dr Kleinman. 
However, experts have no doubt that a lot of human potential is lost to China be cause of depression, as it is everywhere else. The most obvious loss is through suicide. Studies in America show that 15% of severely depressed patients kill themselves and that two-thirds of sufferers contemplate suicide. The WHo puts the global total of suicides attributable to depression at 8oo,ooo a year-more than a quarter the number that dies from tuberculosis. 
You might think this would get governments interested, but it doesn't. The TB deaths are identifiable and the cases that lead to death treatable; suicidal depression is harder to spot or deal with. Most people thinking about mental illness are more likely to concentrate on homicide than suicide.A 1997 study of how British newspapers cover mental health found that 46% of all articles focused on violence and the mentally ill. But only 3% of mentally ill patients are considered a danger to others; 60% of suicides are preceded by depression. Simon Wessely, a psychiatrist at the Maudsley Hospital in London, worries that this unbalanced presentation of the burden of mental illness is fanning public fear and diverting resources from widespread depression to rare psychosis. 
Whether countries fuss about depression or not, it still costs them a lot. Estimates by Ernst Berndt and his colleagues at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology put the annual cost of depression in America at $44 billion as much as coronary heart disease. This amounts to roughly $6,000 for each depressed worker, with employers paying 70% of the bill. 
Medical treatment accounts for $12.4 billion-the cost of drugs, doctors and therapists.Suicide adds a further $7.5 billion to the bill, through lost manpower. But 55% of the cost of depression is due to lower productivity because of absenteeism and poor performance at work, where low energy, poor concentration, associated physical illnesses and illicit drug abuse-- depression often leads to narcotics as a form of self-medication-take their toll. Ron Kessler and Richard Frank of Harvard University are working with big companies and managed-care firms to learn how much productivity might be preserved, and money saved, by early diagnosis and treatment of depression among employees. Catching depression early makes it less likely to develop into a chronic disability; up to a point, the (licit) drugs do work. 
Chasing the blues 
""O-my-God-o-my-God-o-my-God!"" Joseph Schildkraut, professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School, is pacing across a darkened room in the Massachusetts Mental Health Centre, wringing his hands. ""What's going to happen to me?"" 
Dr Schildkraut isn't breaking down; he's acting out the part of a severely depressed and agitated patient in the age before anti-depressant drugs. When Dr Schildkraut arrived in Boston in 1960 to start training as a psychiatrist, the wards were filled with people brought low by the disease, half-starved and suicidal, ""tortured, suffering human beings, robbed of any sense of self or dignity"". 
At that point, the best hope many of those patients had was electroconvulsive therapy, a stock technique for many psychiatric ills. Even then, EC had a poor image: the ""electroshockers"" who carried it out were seen as second-rate compared with psychoanalysts. Today Ecr is reviled by the public, and eschewed by professionals as a treatment of last resort. For all its tarnished image, though, Ecr is a powerful technique. It can cause memory loss, and some patients come to dread it; but western clinicians find that over 80% of those with suicidal or psychotic depression are much improved after five or six sessions over a couple of months. The introduction of muscle relaxants has made broken bones a thing of the past. Why it works, though, is hardly understood at all-a severe drawback in an age where understanding mechanisms is seen as the key to bio-medical success. 
Not long after Dr Schildkraut first saw patients in the depths of depression, new alternatives to electric shocks and talking cures became available. The first anti-depressants-imipramine and phenelzine-were found capable of working wonders in weeks where years of psychoanalysis had failed. Dr Schildkraut was so impressed that he gave up plans to become a psychoanalyst and devoted his career to studying the drugs' biochemical workings. He still marvels at how such medications have completely transformed depression in America, taking the disease out of the asylum and into the consulting room. 
Signal failure 
There is now a $7 billion worldwide market for anti-depressants, expected to expand by 50% over the next five years as early diagnosis and treatment with the newest, most effective drugs is encouraged in medical practice. Three types of drug are in general use: the tricyclics (such as imipramine); the monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIS, among them phenelzine); and the selective serotonin re-uptake inhibitors (ss Rrs). The most famous of these is the world's bestselling anti-depressant, Prozac,which now earns Eli Lilly $2.6 billion a year. 
The enthusiasm which greeted Prozac's launch in America a decade ago was soon tempered by complaints of its side-effects, ranging from the serious shortcoming of sexual dysfunction to dodgy claims that it prompted ideas of suicide. On the whole, though, SSRIS are far safer drugs than their anti-depressant predecessors such as the tricyclics and MAOiS, and thus doctors are more willing to prescribe them. Fewer side-effects mean that patients are more likely to stick to their course of treatment, which may need to last for six months or more to prevent their depression from returning. But the sSRIS are not perfect. They take, on average, two weeks to show an effect, an eternity to anyone who has reason to hope for relief And 40% of patients fail to respond at all. 
All these drugs change the mind's feelings by changing the way chemical signals-neurotransmitters-pass between brain cells. The tricyclics and MAOIs act on a family of neurotransmitters which includes norepinephrine, a chemical which, in a different context, plays a key role in stress responses. ssRIS specifically target one member of the family, serotonin, which is used in areas of the brain where emotions are processed, like the amygdala. 
In the mid-1960s the success of the early drugs led Dr Schildkraut and others to suggest that some depressions were caused by a lack of norepinephrine, possible due to a dysfunctional stress response, and that the drugs worked by making more of the stuff available. This is still reasonably accepted, as far as it goes, and serotonin deficiency is now seen as another part of the same picture. 
But an understanding built up post hoc on the basis of the drugs that work, while useful, is not a full explanation of what is going on. Steve Hyman, director of America's National Institute of Mental Health, believes that ""psychiatry has become intoxicated by its own drugs"" and relies on them too heavily in trying to understand the basis of the disease. He's looking for other paths to understanding, like those explored by Wayne Drevets, at the University of Pittsburgh. Dr Drevets and his team have combined positron emission tomography (which measures blood flow and hence brain activity) with magnetic resonance imaging (which shows the brain structure in fine detail) to hunt for differences between the brains of healthy and depressed people other than the levels of particular chemicals. 
Scans of the depressed show lower-than-normal activity in a bit of the brain called the subgenual prefrontal cortex, an area linked to parts of the brain that deal with stress and emotion. Post mortems seem to show that this is associated with a lack of glial cells, which form a sort of scaffolding that helps the brain's nerve cells develop properly. Using appropriate markers Dr Drevets has confirmed this insight in scans of live patients. At the moment, though, the differences being found are not that large compared with the natural variation in such matters among the non-depressed. Scans are not yet ready to replace the DSM as a test for depression. 
Other psychiatrists are following a genetic route to the biological causes of depression. Finding genes involved in the disease might well lead to better diagnosis and new approaches to treatment, as well as a better picture of how the biological system that goes awry in depression normally works. And establishing a genetic basis for depression might go a long way to legitimising the condition as a fact of biology rather than character. 
The best reason for seeking a genetic component in the disease is that most people with severe depression have relatives who suffer from depression and related disorders as well, though those of an older generation tend to do so in silence (the apparent increase in depression among the young may be in part an increase in openness). ""When I began to talk openly about my depression, suddenly my whole family came out of the closet. My uncle had manic depression, my mother had depression, my daughter is depressed. It seems to have hit everyone,"" recalls Mary Guardino, head of Gn,nMI.Nv, a global alliance of mental illness advocacy networks formed in 1997. 
Families share environments, as well as genes. But studies of pairs of twins, some of whom share all their genes while others share only half, have showed that severe depression is indeed partially explained by genes. In contrast, mild depression has no genetic basis. There the environment is mainly responsible, which explains why such depression can sweep through a population when bad things happen to it. 
Blaming genes is one thing, naming them quite another. The traditional school of gene hunters looks for chromosomal markers linked to cases of depression in large families that suffer from the disease. Another approach, being followed by David Collier, at the Institute of Psychiatry in London, is to focus on genes that control the levels of chemicals like serotonin and norepinephrine. But looking at family pedigrees and known drug-targets will only find some of the many genes that may be playing a role. 
Peter McGuffin of the Institute of Psychiatry thinks he can get past this problem with brute force. He plans to pool DNA from a thousand patients-undoubtedly varying in the severity and genetic make-up of their disease-and analyse it for all the chromosomal landmarks so far identified by the Human Genome Project. He will then compare this profile with that of a thousand healthy subjects. Where differences pop up (and he is confident they will), his group can then go back to the 2,000 individual samples and see if the variations correlate with disease. Such a large undertaking would have been impractical a decade ago, but new DNA screening technologies mean that it can now be done at speed. Dr McGuffin reckons that once started, his project could starting yielding results in two or three years. 
Pain and prescription 
These inquiries assume that people can be predisposed to depression by various genes, and thus that some live in constant danger of being pushed over the edge by some event in their lives (or conceivably by some chemical toxin or biological infection, though claims along these lines are very sketchy). If such people could be identified before they get sick, there might be ways to preempt the disease, either using existing anti-depressants or new drugs, of which many are in development. Most are aimed at norepinephrine or serotonin, but a few are targeted elsewhere. 
One of these exceptions is Merck's MK-869, which blocks the action of a neurotransmitter known as substance P, thought to be responsible for transmitting sensations of pain. Early studies show it relieving the symptoms of major depression as well as the SSRIs do, but with fewer side-effects. The molecule may also act more rap idly, though larger clinical trials are needed as confirmation. Since it acts on a hitherto unexploited target, Merck hopes that it may help those patients who are untouched by other anti-depressants. Interestingly, despite what is believed about substance P'S function, the new drug does nothing for physical pain. But a non-bodily form of pain-what William Styron, an American writer, described as ""a form of torment so alien to everyday experience""-is the badge of depression. 
For most of the world's depressed, though, new antidepressants are not the answer. Take the booming population of depressives in Russia. Suicide there has soared since 1991, accompanied by skyrocketing rates of alcohol abuse. Zurab Kekelidze, deputy director of Moscow's Serbsky Centre for Social and Forensic Psychiatry, is not surprised. ""The whole country is suffering from the shocks of economic decline, unemployment and uncontrollable life events. These are known to trigger borderline mental illness, like depression, post-traumatic stress disorder and aggression."" In fact Russia is a particularly dramatic illustration of a general truth; economic hardship breeds depression. Folk images of Prozac-popping yuppies aside, in the West it is the poor who suffer disproportionately from the disease. 
For depressed Russians, Prozac is about as accessible as a BMw. Instead patients must make do with the drug industry's equivalent of a Lada, the tricyclics. It's not a smooth ride, and it often breaks down, but at least the tricyclics drive some patients from illness to recovery. Most of the world is in the same position: the SSRIS are on patent and would be unaffordable even if governments made depression a priority. 
There are also non-prescription remedies. St John's Wort, an age-old herbal treatment for ""nervous complaints"", is now seven times more popular than Prozac for treating depression in Germany and gaining ground elsewhere. The upshot of 23 small studies in Europe is that it can lift the symptoms of low mood, insomnia, fatigue and poor appetite in 70% of patients with mild depression. But these investigations were too short, too small and too variable to convince the medical establishment. Studies of anti-depressants are particularly prone to ""placebo effects"": about a quarter of test subjects will improve on sugar pills alone. 
As Richard Findlay, a consultant with A.T. Kearney, points out, if studies currently under way bring St John's Wort into the medical mainstream, it could help reshape the global anti-depressant market. Prozac's patent runs out in 2003, at which point it might make sense for Eli Lilly to start selling it as an over-the-counter remedy. Glaxo Wellcome did this when its prescription ulcer medicine Zantac went off patent, and the strategy has been quite successful. The world's experience with inexpensive, non-prescription St John's Wort might one day push Eli Lilly in the same direction. 
The prospect of Prozac on sale in the supermarket disturbs many people. They worry that instead of being used to treat malignant sadness, the drug will be used on the common-or-garden variety. They may well be right. In general, people seem to like mood-altering drugs; people who are just sad, as well as people who are depressed, often turn to the bottle. Laurence Kirmayer of McGill University speaks for many when he says that the west has gone too far in creating an ""analgesic society"", treating happiness as a default setting and using drugs to pull deviation back to the norm. It sometimes seems that psychological pain has lost any moral or spiritual value it may have held for earlier generations. 
Dr Kleinman points out that when he started his psychiatric training in the early 197os, bereavement was a process which lasted 13 months; after this, the sleeplessness, poor appetite, low energy and sadness were diagnosed as depression and treated accordingly. But in the most recent version of the DSM, such grief gets short shrift: it officially becomes depression after eight weeks and is generally dosed with drugs. If you agree with Dr Kleinman that grief is essential to recovery from bereavement, then drugging people back to contentment is scarcely a solution. He believes that, in the West at least, too much effort is spent on expanding depression to include its hinterland-mild mood imbalances, natural grieving processes and terminal illness-and not enough on the core of the disease. It is certainly true that more people in the west are taking anti-depressants for more reasons. In America 80% of those diagnosed with depression-including secondary depression, which typically accompanies other disorders such as panic and chronic anxiety, and the incidence of which is growing-are given an SSRI as the first line of treatment. The drugs are being used for an ever broader range of disorders: social phobia, obsessive-compulsive disorder, post-traumatic stress syndrome, panic disorder and more. (Mr Findlay points out that all these new indications may end up increasing the world-wide availabilty of anti-depressants. While governments may turn a blind eye to depression they are increasingly clear on the costs of tobacco-related disease-and one of the world's best-selling smoking-cessation drugs, Zyban, is simply an anti-depressant repackaged.) It's a fair bet that the more anti-depressants there are looking for niches, the more such disorders will be diagnosed and treated. 
The loser in this advance is psychotherapy, which although proven effective in dealing with milder forms of depression is now rarely used to its best advantage in America: it takes more sessions to see an effect than most managed-care companies are willing to cover. In health care, as in most industries, parts are far cheaper than labour. But sometimes the labour can be found for free; around the world, people with depression, like other sufferers from long-term disease, are getting organised. They are finding new ways to talk to each other, to doctors and to the world about how they feel and what they need. 
Fifteen months ago Zane Wilson set up the Depression and Anxiety Support Group in the rural South African townships of Siyabuswa, Letaba and Bisho. Counsellors were trained to discuss and detect depression; traditional healers, after much persuasion, promised to refer patients to the counsellors if their own herbs, incisions and other methods failed to work. Ms Wilson says the initiative has been so successful that patients have started turning up at local clinics knowing far more about depression than their general practitioners-- many of whom firmly believe that black Africans never suffer from depression or anxiety. Drug companies are helping supply treatments, South Africa's scarce professional psychiatrists-one for every 170,000 people, compared with one for every 5,500 Americans-are helping train the local doctors. 
Similar projects of community-based screening and primary-care treatment in countries as far-flung as Iran and Sweden have earned rave reviews from mental-- health specialists. In most of the world governments will not pay for enough professional psychiatrists and psychotherapists to begin to deal with all the depression which now slips through the system undiagnosed. And not only can patient groups help in getting the disease diagnosed; they are also set on attacking the stigma that surrounds it. 
Patient groups can achieve a lot both medically and in terms of acceptance, as AIDS activism of various sorts has demonstrated. But there is a long way to go. Public figures willing to admit depression are rare-Kjell Magne Bondevik, Norway's prime minister, is a brave exception-and a belief that people's feelings are their own fault still prevails. Anti-depressants, despite the fact that they can help both patients and economies, are often not treated as necessary parts of health-care budgets but as insidious dangers. One depressed woman in Britain explains the attitudes she encounters like this: ""I've had depression since I was a teenager, and no amount of therapy or religion has brought me relief Anti-depressants work, and I will keep taking them for as long as they keep the floods at bay. Some, who know my condition, behave as though I have a dangerous addiction. Do they worry that a diabetic is dependent on insulin? Of course not, because diabetes is seen as a real disease and depression isn't. The day I reveal my depression, without fear of disdain or discrimination, will be the day I'm cured of it."" A disease of the mind cannot be cured with chemicals alone; attitudes must change too. ","Malignant sadness is the world's great hidden burden 
FALLING interest rates, collapsing confidence and sluggish activity all command the attention of economic policy makers. Seen in people rather than countries or markets, though, the same symptoms cause much less of a stir. That's why there is so little outcry about the fact that there are 330m people around the world suffering from depression, 90% of whom won't get adequate treatment. The disease afflicts more people than heart disease-far more than AIDS-and most cases are not even diagnosed.

But China still reports 200 times less major depression than America. The idea of depression has yet to be accepted: ""Ask many Chinese if they're depressed, and they simply don't understand what you mean by the word,"" according to Dr Kleinman. 
However, experts have no doubt that a lot of human potential is lost to China be cause of depression, as it is everywhere else. The most obvious loss is through suicide. Studies in America show that 15% of severely depressed patients kill themselves and that two-thirds of sufferers contemplate suicide. The WHo puts the global total of suicides attributable to depression at 8oo,ooo a year-more than a quarter the number that dies from tuberculosis. 
You might think this would get governments interested, but it doesn't. The TB deaths are identifiable and the cases that lead to death treatable; suicidal depression is harder to spot or deal with. Most people thinking about mental illness are more likely to concentrate on homicide than suicide.A 1997 study of how British newspapers cover mental health found that 46% of all articles focused on violence and the mentally ill. But only 3% of mentally ill patients are considered a danger to others; 60% of suicides are preceded by depression. Simon Wessely, a psychiatrist at the Maudsley Hospital in London, worries that this unbalanced presentation of the burden of mental illness is fanning public fear and diverting resources from widespread depression to rare psychosis. 
Whether countries fuss about depression or not, it still costs them a lot. Estimates by Ernst Berndt and his colleagues at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology put the annual cost of depression in America at $44 billion as much as coronary heart disease. This amounts to roughly $6,000 for each depressed worker, with employers paying 70% of the bill. 
Medical treatment accounts for $12.4 billion-the cost of drugs, doctors and therapists.Suicide adds a further $7.5 billion to the bill, through lost manpower. But 55% of the cost of depression is due to lower productivity because of absenteeism and poor performance at work, where low energy, poor concentration, associated physical illnesses and illicit drug abuse-- depression often leads to narcotics as a form of self-medication-take their toll. Ron Kessler and Richard Frank of Harvard University are working with big companies and managed-care firms to learn how much productivity might be preserved, and money saved, by early diagnosis and treatment of depression among employees. Catching depression early makes it less likely to develop into a chronic disability; up to a point, the (licit) drugs do work. 
Chasing the blues 
""O-my-God-o-my-God-o-my-God!"" Joseph Schildkraut, professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School, is pacing across a darkened room in the Massachusetts Mental Health Centre, wringing his hands. ""What's going to happen to me?"" 
Dr Schildkraut isn't breaking down; he's acting out the part of a severely depressed and agitated patient in the age before anti-depressant drugs. When Dr Schildkraut arrived in Boston in 1960 to start training as a psychiatrist, the wards were filled with people brought low by the disease, half-starved and suicidal, ""tortured, suffering human beings, robbed of any sense of self or dignity"". 
At that point, the best hope many of those patients had was electroconvulsive therapy, a stock technique for many psychiatric ills. Even then, EC had a poor image: the ""electroshockers"" who carried it out were seen as second-rate compared with psychoanalysts. Today Ecr is reviled by the public, and eschewed by professionals as a treatment of last resort. For all its tarnished image, though, Ecr is a powerful technique. It can cause memory loss, and some patients come to dread it; but western clinicians find that over 80% of those with suicidal or psychotic depression are much improved after five or six sessions over a couple of months. The introduction of muscle relaxants has made broken bones a thing of the past. Why it works, though, is hardly understood at all-a severe drawback in an age where understanding mechanisms is seen as the key to bio-medical success. 
Not long after Dr Schildkraut first saw patients in the depths of depression, new alternatives to electric shocks and talking cures became available. The first anti-depressants-imipramine and phenelzine-were found capable of working wonders in weeks where years of psychoanalysis had failed. Dr Schildkraut was so impressed that he gave up plans to become a psychoanalyst and devoted his career to studying the drugs' biochemical workings. He still marvels at how such medications have completely transformed depression in America, taking the disease out of the asylum and into the consulting room. 
Signal failure 
There is now a $7 billion worldwide market for anti-depressants, expected to expand by 50% over the next five years as early diagnosis and treatment with the newest, most effective drugs is encouraged in medical practice. Three types of drug are in general use: the tricyclics (such as imipramine); the monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIS, among them phenelzine); and the selective serotonin re-uptake inhibitors (ss Rrs). The most famous of these is the world's bestselling anti-depressant, Prozac,which now earns Eli Lilly $2.6 billion a year. 
The enthusiasm which greeted Prozac's launch in America a decade ago was soon tempered by complaints of its side-effects, ranging from the serious shortcoming of sexual dysfunction to dodgy claims that it prompted ideas of suicide. On the whole, though, SSRIS are far safer drugs than their anti-depressant predecessors such as the tricyclics and MAOiS, and thus doctors are more willing to prescribe them. Fewer side-effects mean that patients are more likely to stick to their course of treatment, which may need to last for six months or more to prevent their depression from returning. But the sSRIS are not perfect. They take, on average, two weeks to show an effect, an eternity to anyone who has reason to hope for relief And 40% of patients fail to respond at all. 
All these drugs change the mind's feelings by changing the way chemical signals-neurotransmitters-pass between brain cells. The tricyclics and MAOIs act on a family of neurotransmitters which includes norepinephrine, a chemical which, in a different context, plays a key role in stress responses. ssRIS specifically target one member of the family, serotonin, which is used in areas of the brain where emotions are processed, like the amygdala. 
In the mid-1960s the success of the early drugs led Dr Schildkraut and others to suggest that some depressions were caused by a lack of norepinephrine, possible due to a dysfunctional stress response, and that the drugs worked by making more of the stuff available. This is still reasonably accepted, as far as it goes, and serotonin deficiency is now seen as another part of the same picture. 
But an understanding built up post hoc on the basis of the drugs that work, while useful, is not a full explanation of what is going on. Steve Hyman, director of America's National Institute of Mental Health, believes that ""psychiatry has become intoxicated by its own drugs"" and relies on them too heavily in trying to understand the basis of the disease. He's looking for other paths to understanding, like those explored by Wayne Drevets, at the University of Pittsburgh. Dr Drevets and his team have combined positron emission tomography (which measures blood flow and hence brain activity) with magnetic resonance imaging (which shows the brain structure in fine detail) to hunt for differences between the brains of healthy and depressed people other than the levels of particular chemicals. 
Scans of the depressed show lower-than-normal activity in a bit of the brain called the subgenual prefrontal cortex, an area linked to parts of the brain that deal with stress and emotion. Post mortems seem to show that this is associated with a lack of glial cells, which form a sort of scaffolding that helps the brain's nerve cells develop properly. Using appropriate markers Dr Drevets has confirmed this insight in scans of live patients. At the moment, though, the differences being found are not that large compared with the natural variation in such matters among the non-depressed. Scans are not yet ready to replace the DSM as a test for depression. 
Other psychiatrists are following a genetic route to the biological causes of depression. Finding genes involved in the disease might well lead to better diagnosis and new approaches to treatment, as well as a better picture of how the biological system that goes awry in depression normally works. And establishing a genetic basis for depression might go a long way to legitimising the condition as a fact of biology rather than character. 
The best reason for seeking a genetic component in the disease is that most people with severe depression have relatives who suffer from depression and related disorders as well, though those of an older generation tend to do so in silence (the apparent increase in depression among the young may be in part an increase in openness). ""When I began to talk openly about my depression, suddenly my whole family came out of the closet. My uncle had manic depression, my mother had depression, my daughter is depressed. It seems to have hit everyone,"" recalls Mary Guardino, head of Gn,nMI.Nv, a global alliance of mental illness advocacy networks formed in 1997. 
Families share environments, as well as genes. But studies of pairs of twins, some of whom share all their genes while others share only half, have showed that severe depression is indeed partially explained by genes. In contrast, mild depression has no genetic basis. There the environment is mainly responsible, which explains why such depression can sweep through a population when bad things happen to it. 
Blaming genes is one thing, naming them quite another. The traditional school of gene hunters looks for chromosomal markers linked to cases of depression in large families that suffer from the disease. Another approach, being followed by David Collier, at the Institute of Psychiatry in London, is to focus on genes that control the levels of chemicals like serotonin and norepinephrine. But looking at family pedigrees and known drug-targets will only find some of the many genes that may be playing a role. 
Peter McGuffin of the Institute of Psychiatry thinks he can get past this problem with brute force. He plans to pool DNA from a thousand patients-undoubtedly varying in the severity and genetic make-up of their disease-and analyse it for all the chromosomal landmarks so far identified by the Human Genome Project. He will then compare this profile with that of a thousand healthy subjects. Where differences pop up (and he is confident they will), his group can then go back to the 2,000 individual samples and see if the variations correlate with disease. Such a large undertaking would have been impractical a decade ago, but new DNA screening technologies mean that it can now be done at speed. Dr McGuffin reckons that once started, his project could starting yielding results in two or three years. 
Pain and prescription 
These inquiries assume that people can be predisposed to depression by various genes, and thus that some live in constant danger of being pushed over the edge by some event in their lives (or conceivably by some chemical toxin or biological infection, though claims along these lines are very sketchy). If such people could be identified before they get sick, there might be ways to preempt the disease, either using existing anti-depressants or new drugs, of which many are in development. Most are aimed at norepinephrine or serotonin, but a few are targeted elsewhere. 
One of these exceptions is Merck's MK-869, which blocks the action of a neurotransmitter known as substance P, thought to be responsible for transmitting sensations of pain. Early studies show it relieving the symptoms of major depression as well as the SSRIs do, but with fewer side-effects. The molecule may also act more rap idly, though larger clinical trials are needed as confirmation. Since it acts on a hitherto unexploited target, Merck hopes that it may help those patients who are untouched by other anti-depressants. Interestingly, despite what is believed about substance P'S function, the new drug does nothing for physical pain. But a non-bodily form of pain-what William Styron, an American writer, described as ""a form of torment so alien to everyday experience""-is the badge of depression. 
For most of the world's depressed, though, new antidepressants are not the answer. Take the booming population of depressives in Russia. Suicide there has soared since 1991, accompanied by skyrocketing rates of alcohol abuse. Zurab Kekelidze, deputy director of Moscow's Serbsky Centre for Social and Forensic Psychiatry, is not surprised. ""The whole country is suffering from the shocks of economic decline, unemployment and uncontrollable life events. These are known to trigger borderline mental illness, like depression, post-traumatic stress disorder and aggression."" In fact Russia is a particularly dramatic illustration of a general truth; economic hardship breeds depression. Folk images of Prozac-popping yuppies aside, in the West it is the poor who suffer disproportionately from the disease. 
For depressed Russians, Prozac is about as accessible as a BMw. Instead patients must make do with the drug industry's equivalent of a Lada, the tricyclics. It's not a smooth ride, and it often breaks down, but at least the tricyclics drive some patients from illness to recovery. Most of the world is in the same position: the SSRIS are on patent and would be unaffordable even if governments made depression a priority. 
There are also non-prescription remedies. St John's Wort, an age-old herbal treatment for ""nervous complaints"", is now seven times more popular than Prozac for treating depression in Germany and gaining ground elsewhere. The upshot of 23 small studies in Europe is that it can lift the symptoms of low mood, insomnia, fatigue and poor appetite in 70% of patients with mild depression. But these investigations were too short, too small and too variable to convince the medical establishment. Studies of anti-depressants are particularly prone to ""placebo effects"": about a quarter of test subjects will improve on sugar pills alone. 
As Richard Findlay, a consultant with A.T. Kearney, points out, if studies currently under way bring St John's Wort into the medical mainstream, it could help reshape the global anti-depressant market. Prozac's patent runs out in 2003, at which point it might make sense for Eli Lilly to start selling it as an over-the-counter remedy. Glaxo Wellcome did this when its prescription ulcer medicine Zantac went off patent, and the strategy has been quite successful. The world's experience with inexpensive, non-prescription St John's Wort might one day push Eli Lilly in the same direction. 
The prospect of Prozac on sale in the supermarket disturbs many people. They worry that instead of being used to treat malignant sadness, the drug will be used on the common-or-garden variety. They may well be right. In general, people seem to like mood-altering drugs; people who are just sad, as well as people who are depressed, often turn to the bottle. Laurence Kirmayer of McGill University speaks for many when he says that the west has gone too far in creating an ""analgesic society"", treating happiness as a default setting and using drugs to pull deviation back to the norm. It sometimes seems that psychological pain has lost any moral or spiritual value it may have held for earlier generations. 
Dr Kleinman points out that when he started his psychiatric training in the early 197os, bereavement was a process which lasted 13 months; after this, the sleeplessness, poor appetite, low energy and sadness were diagnosed as depression and treated accordingly. But in the most recent version of the DSM, such grief gets short shrift: it officially becomes depression after eight weeks and is generally dosed with drugs. If you agree with Dr Kleinman that grief is essential to recovery from bereavement, then drugging people back to contentment is scarcely a solution. He believes that, in the West at least, too much effort is spent on expanding depression to include its hinterland-mild mood imbalances, natural grieving processes and terminal illness-and not enough on the core of the disease. It is certainly true that more people in the west are taking anti-depressants for more reasons. In America 80% of those diagnosed with depression-including secondary depression, which typically accompanies other disorders such as panic and chronic anxiety, and the incidence of which is growing-are given an SSRI as the first line of treatment. The drugs are being used for an ever broader range of disorders: social phobia, obsessive-compulsive disorder, post-traumatic stress syndrome, panic disorder and more. (Mr Findlay points out that all these new indications may end up increasing the world-wide availabilty of anti-depressants. While governments may turn a blind eye to depression they are increasingly clear on the costs of tobacco-related disease-and one of the world's best-selling smoking-cessation drugs, Zyban, is simply an anti-depressant repackaged.) It's a fair bet that the more anti-depressants there are looking for niches, the more such disorders will be diagnosed and treated. 
The loser in this advance is psychotherapy, which although proven effective in dealing with milder forms of depression is now rarely used to its best advantage in America: it takes more sessions to see an effect than most managed-care companies are willing to cover. In health care, as in most industries, parts are far cheaper than labour. But sometimes the labour can be found for free; around the world, people with depression, like other sufferers from long-term disease, are getting organised. They are finding new ways to talk to each other, to doctors and to the world about how they feel and what they need. 
Fifteen months ago Zane Wilson set up the Depression and Anxiety Support Group in the rural South African townships of Siyabuswa, Letaba and Bisho. Counsellors were trained to discuss and detect depression; traditional healers, after much persuasion, promised to refer patients to the counsellors if their own herbs, incisions and other methods failed to work. Ms Wilson says the initiative has been so successful that patients have started turning up at local clinics knowing far more about depression than their general practitioners-- many of whom firmly believe that black Africans never suffer from depression or anxiety. Drug companies are helping supply treatments, South Africa's scarce professional psychiatrists-one for every 170,000 people, compared with one for every 5,500 Americans-are helping train the local doctors. 
Similar projects of community-based screening and primary-care treatment in countries as far-flung as Iran and Sweden have earned rave reviews from mental-- health specialists. In most of the world governments will not pay for enough professional psychiatrists and psychotherapists to begin to deal with all the depression which now slips through the system undiagnosed. And not only can patient groups help in getting the disease diagnosed; they are also set on attacking the stigma that surrounds it. 
Patient groups can achieve a lot both medically and in terms of acceptance, as AIDS activism of various sorts has demonstrated. But there is a long way to go. Public figures willing to admit depression are rare-Kjell Magne Bondevik, Norway's prime minister, is a brave exception-and a belief that people's feelings are their own fault still prevails. Anti-depressants, despite the fact that they can help both patients and economies, are often not treated as necessary parts of health-care budgets but as insidious dangers. One depressed woman in Britain explains the attitudes she encounters like this: ""I've had depression since I was a teenager, and no amount of therapy or religion has brought me relief Anti-depressants work, and I will keep taking them for as long as they keep the floods at bay. Some, who know my condition, behave as though I have a dangerous addiction. Do they worry that a diabetic is dependent on insulin? Of course not, because diabetes is seen as a real disease and depression isn't. The day I reveal my depression, without fear of disdain or discrimination, will be the day I'm cured of it."" A disease of the mind cannot be cured with chemicals alone; attitudes must change too. ",385,Norway,A29-6052,,False,,0,True

Despite falling oil prices, their economy has gone on growing at an average of more than 4% over the past five years. Instead of splurging out, they dutifully put much of their oil cash into a special savings pot for a rainy day: it now tots up to nearly$16 billion. Norway has the lowest unemployment rate in mainland Europe (bar Luxembourg), at 3%. Its GDP per head at purchasing-power parity is third-highest in the world, ahead of all the other Nordics. 
Nobody knows when the oil will run out. It could start flowing less freely in about ten years, but enormous reserves of offshore gas (which currently accounts for about 15% of Norway's combined oiland-gas income) will go some way towards offsetting lower oil revenues. By any standards, Norway is exceptionally rich. 
Like other Nordics, Norwegians attach enormous importance to social equality and a generous social-security net. But the drop in oil prices over the past year has persuaded all the main political parties that a bit of thrift is in order. The budget for this year has been revised downwards. Already over the past few years sickness, disability and unemployment benefits, as well as support for single mothers, have begun to flow a little less freely. Besides, Norway's welfare state has always been rather less lavish than those of the other main Nordic countries, its public sector smaller, its overall tax burden appreciably less heavy. 
But some shadows are darkening this sunlit picture. Norway has failed to diversify enough. True, it has created superbly efficient fish farms-but no serious industrial or manufacturing base. It still has lO%, in tonnage, of the world's commercial fleet, but its shipping is in the doldrums. ""Shipping is dead,"" declares one of Norway's leading entrepreneurs, whose family once drew its wealth from ships. In banking and financial services, the country has been slower to liberalise and consolidate than its Nordic rivals. Several of Norway's political parties are tinged with protectionism. 
Moreover, high social costs and restrictions on hiring and firing make it hard for small and medium-sized businesses to get going. Less money than in other Nordic countries goes into research and development. ""No one in their right mind would set up a factory in Norway,"" says the editor of a leading financial newspaper. ""We capitalists have been crowded out by bureaucrats from the stateowned banks and oil companies,"" says the entrepreneur from the shipping family. 
Political leadership has been in short supply of late. A minority government of the centre-right is hanging on, with a mere 42 seats out of 165 in parliament. In a Nordic tale of consensus politics and secular piety, the prime minister, Kjell Magne Bondevik, a Lutheran priest from the Christian Democratic Party, last autumn disappeared from view for nearly four weeks, claiming a ""depressive reaction to overwork"". Nobody seemed much to mind. The rather colourless leader of the opposition Labour Party, Thorbjorn Jagland, declared primly: ""One must be allowed to be sick in this country."" The press left Mr Bondevik alone, awarding him brownie points for his ""openness"". 
The Labour Party, as Norway's social democrats are called, had been the natural party of government for decades until it lost power in 1997. It seems in no hurry to take back the reins-and has no drastically different policies on offer, though it has been kicking up a big fuss over the Christian Democrats' proposal to offer mothers cash to stay at home and look after their children. 
The continuing rise to prominence of Carl I. Hagen gives Norwegian politics a more intriguing twist. Mr Hagen is a maverick of the libertarian and populist right who defies the Nordic tradition of consensus, though even he forbore to snipe at Mr Bondevik for his walk in the woods. Mr Hagen and his Progressive Party have-until now-been given the cold shoulder by the mainstream parties because of his perceived hostility to immigrants, of whom Norway has a small but rising number. More broadly, he calls for lower taxes but also higher spending on such causes as old people, computers in schools, and shortening hospital waiting-lists. To pay for them, he naughtily suggests dipping into the oil-gotten national savings pot. 
In the 1997 general election Mr Hagen garnered the second-biggest share of the vote, with 15% to Labour's 35%. He seems well on the way to establishing his party as Norway's leading force on the mainstream right. Mr Bondevik's centre-right lot has been depending on Progressive Party support for such matters as passing the budget and getting the child-care voucher scheme through. But, unNordic as he is, Mr Hagen says he now wants his party to be formally included in a ruling coalition. 
Don't mention it 
What makes Norway the mainland Nordics' oddest man out is its extreme awkwardness towards the Eu. The question of membership is off the current agenda, but Norwegians are not united in their view of Europe. They are at one only in a shared reluctance to reopen an acrimonious debatewhich cannot, however, be put off for ever. 
The fragile ruling coalition is utterly divided. Mr Bondevik's party voted against joining in 1994, but the prime minister has apparently changed his, if not his party's, mind. The Centre Party, led by the redoubtable Anne Enger Lahnstein, who stood in as prime minister when Mr Bondevik was out of action, is virulently against. Her Centrists stand for the farmers and the fishermen, the countryside against the cities, the wild north against the softer south. Mrs Lahnstein is against even being part of the EEA. The EU, she has said, is ""good for multinationals but bad for our farmers, our small companies, our poor, our environment and the third world"". The third party in the coalition, the Liberals, is in favour of joining the Union. 
The Labour Party is no more united over Europe. Mr Jagland and most of his party bigwigs want to join, the rank and file are two-thirds in favour, the trade unions evenly split and the old socialist left and most of the young hotly against. 
As for Mr Hagen, unlike far-right leaders in other Nordic countries and elsewhere in Europe, he has broadly favoured joining, but has recently begun to equivocate. On euro membership, he, along with most Norwegians, is doubtful to hostile. 
Eu enthusiasts point to high interest rates and the Norwegian krone's wobbliness during the recent international financial turmoil, whereas the Finnish markka, even before it entered the euro, stood firm. But those Norwegians who want to stay out of both the currency club and the entire Union point out that membership of the EEA provides almost all the advantages of Union membership. The downside is that Norway has to abide by a large majority of EU rules, yet has no say in making them. 
More broadly, too, and especially in foreign policy, Norway is increasingly left out of the loop. ""It really has been marginalised,"" says a senior Swedish minister. Many Norwegian diplomats admit privately that they are finding it harder to gain a hearing from their foreign counterparts. 
Not that Norway is altogether detached. It is, after all, a zealous member of NATO, making much of being the Alliance's only country to share a border with Russia, and it holds the rotating presidency of the Organisation for Security and Co-operation in Europe. It is also keen on every sort of collaboration in the Arctic region and in the Barents Sea, with the United States, Canada, Russia and other Europeans. It feels a special affinity for Britain and the United States, and a special disapproval for French attempts to create a European foreign policy. 
Norway can also cut a dash mediating in such troubled places as Myanmar, Colombia, Guatemala and the Middle East. It was in Oslo in 1994, remember, that the then Norwegian foreign minister, the late Johan Jorgen Holst, got Israelis and Palestinians to agree in principle to peace. Note, too, that Norway still shells out a higher percentage of its GDP than any other country, o.88% at last count, in aid to the world's poor countries. 
From Norway's point of view, much depends on who prevails in Europe: those who seek to create a new European foreign policy, or those who want to keep NATO as Europe's strategic cornerstone. But Norwegians tend to be wary of ""unions"": they have too often found themselves at the wrong end of them. It was no fun being subservient to Denmark from 1536 to 1814, to Sweden from then until 19o5, and to Nazi Germany (and Vidkun Quisling) in the second world war.

 As for Mr Hagen , unlike far - right leaders in other Nordic countries and elsewhere in Europe , he has broadly favoured joining , but has recently begun to equivocate . On euro membership , he , along with most Norwegians , is doubtful to hostile . 
 Eu enthusiasts point to high interest rates and the Norwegian krone 's wobbliness during the recent international financial turmoil , whereas the Finnish markka , even before it entered the euro , stood firm . But those Norwegians who want to stay out of both the currency club and the entire Union point out that membership of the EEA provides almost all the advantages of Union membership . The downside is that Norway has to abide by a large majority of EU rules , yet has no say in making them . 
 More broadly , too , and especially in foreign policy , Norway is increasingly left out of the loop . "" It really has been marginalised , "" says a senior Swedish minister . Many Norwegian diplomats admit privately that they are finding it harder to gain a hearing from their foreign counterparts . 
 Not that Norway is altogether detached . It is , after all , a zealous member of NATO , making much of being the Alliance 's only country to share a border with Russia , and it holds the rotating presidency of the Organisation for Security and Co - operation in Europe . It is also keen on every sort of collaboration in the Arctic region and in the Barents Sea , with the United States , Canada , Russia and other Europeans . It feels a special affinity for Britain and the United States , and a special disapproval for French attempts to create a European foreign policy . 
 Norway can also cut a dash mediating in such troubled places as Myanmar , Colombia , Guatemala and the Middle East . It was in Oslo in 1994 , remember , that the then Norwegian foreign minister , the late Johan Jorgen Holst , got Israelis and Palestinians to agree in principle to peace . Note , too , that Norway still shells out a higher percentage of its GDP than any other country , o.88 % at last count , in aid to the world 's poor countries . 
 From Norway 's point of view , much depends on who prevails in Europe : those who seek to create a new European foreign policy , or those who want to keep NATO as Europe 's strategic cornerstone . But Norwegians tend to be wary of "" unions "" : they have too often found themselves at the wrong end of them . It was no fun being subservient to Denmark from 1536 to 1814 , to Sweden from then until 19o5 , and to Nazi Germany ( and Vidkun Quisling ) in the second world war . No wonder the Norwegians win the Nordic prize for nationalistic prickliness .",385,Norway,A29-6052,POST TERM,True,"the prime minister , Kjell Magne Bondevik , a Lutheran priest from the Christian Democratic Party",12,True

WERE the Danes and Swedes wise to shun the euro? They are asking themselves that question ever more insistently, and even the Norwegians are wondering aloud whether they are sensible to stay out of the European Union altogether. 
Why the change? For one thing, the Scandinavians have noted how much more stable the Finnish markka, which is in the euro-club, has been against their own currencies during the past half-year of global turbulence. And in the past two months the Finns have been loudly congratulating themselves on joining the euro in the first group of 11 countries. 
Denmark is the swing country as far as Scandinavian attitudes to Europe, and the euro, are concerned. Of the wait-and-see brigade, it has long been closest to taking the plunge into the euro zone. If it did so, the pressure on Sweden to follow suit-and on Norway at least to join the EU-would mount. But Danish governments remain wary of being pulled into any European scheme against the wishes of their people, who rejected the Maastricht treaty when first consulted by referendum in 1992. 
However, Denmark's Social Democrats, who run the country in a fragile coalition, have been hardening up their euro-plans. Their leader, Poul Nyrup Rasmussen, has been sounding a lot keener. He has not given a date for a promised referendum, but the spring of 2001 is being mooted. It could be even earlier. If the Danes say yesopinion polls show the pros moving well ahead of the antis-they could have euro coins jingling in their pockets at the same time as people in the other ii euro-countries-in January 2002. 
The more suspicious Swedes have begun edging towards euro-friendliness too. A poll published on January 25th showed just over half now in favour, with less than a third flat opposed. Still, Sweden's ruling Social Democrats remain much more divided than their Danish counterparts. The prime minister, Goran Persson, is still wary-but at least he now says he wants a debate to begin. Some say this is code for conceding that he now accepts the inevitability of Sweden adopting the euro, especially if Denmark does. On February 19th his foreign minister, Anna Lindh, said that the Social Democrats might decide as early as next year. A referendum now looks possible in Sweden in 2001, perhaps sooner. And if Britain were to declare its clear intention to join, the pressure in Scandinavia would become irresistible. 
But many leading Swedish Social Democrats are still loth to be railroaded. Their coalition partners, the Greens and the excommunists, remain hostile: some of their leading lights are still against being in the Eu at all. And the popularity of the European Union as a whole remains low. The euro-argument is only just beginning in earnest. That, though, is quite a change. 
In Norway the debate is of another kind. After periodic bruising battles over EU membership, the last of which ended in 1994 with a narrow vote to stay out, the Norwegians are still reluctant to reopen the wounds. But Thorbjorn Jagland, leader of the opposition Labour Party, has been tentatively raising the issue again, partly to embarrass the ruling centre-right minority coalition, which is at odds with itself over a number of European issues. Last time, the prime minister, Kjell Magne Bondevik, and his fellow Christian Democrats voted against joining. 
Mr Jagland may bring up the matter this spring when parliament debates the EU'S Schengen agreement on free movement across borders, which Norway is expected to agree to-though one party in the fragile ruling coalition is uneasy even about that. But even in sceptical Norway, where support for joining the EU plummeted after the No vote of 1994, people are thinking again: a year ago, less than a third wanted the country to join the Eu, but an opinion poll this year suggested that most Norwegians now favour the idea. When the next general election comes round, in 2001, the EU issue may well force its way back to the top of the political agenda.

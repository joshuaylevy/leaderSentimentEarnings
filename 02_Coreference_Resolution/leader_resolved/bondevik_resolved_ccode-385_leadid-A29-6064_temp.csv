 ON THE face of things, Scandinavians enjoy the paradox of being sturdy monarchists and relentless egalitarians all at once. Judging by the whoops and cheers in Oslo's streets last weekend, when Norway's crown prince married a commoner with a four-year-old child born out of wedlock with a convicted drug offender, many still feel that way. But republican sentiment in Norway and Sweden is far from dead. In the past week, two of Scandinavia's biggest newspapers have called for their countries' monarchies to go. Only Denmark's popular royals have been largely unscathed.
 Dagbladet, whose Saturday edition is said to be read by a third of all Norwegians, marked the prince's wedding day with an editorial calling for a republic. And Sweden's Dagens Nyheter, the country's largest and most influential daily, surprised many of its readers by demanding the same in Sweden. ""Royalty and the public should both be freed from the anachronism of a hereditary monarchy"", its editorial opined. Sweden's head of state (or monarch, if people still want one) should instead be elected.
 Not that the constitutional monarchies of Sweden, Norway or Denmark are under immediate threat. All three have been rather good at reflecting their people's worthy tastes. Indeed, a recent opinion poll said that four out of five Swedes still want a monarchy, while their king, Carl Gustaf, always scores well in the country's annual popularity contest.
 But this sudden surge in republican spirit in the media suggests that things can change fast. Norwegians' support for their monarchy has dipped sharply. A decade ago, some 80-90% backed it, but a poll earlier this year put the figure at 58%, the lowest ever recorded. This went up a shade, to 62%, on the eve of the recent royal wedding. But several prominent Norwegians, including Kjell Magne Bondevik, a former prime minister who leads the opposition Christian Democrats, have raised questions about the monarchy's future.
 Most mainstream political parties in Norway and Sweden say they are content to let their monarchies be. But ever more intrusive and irreverent press coverage is subjecting Nordic royals to new and unfamiliar pressures. Sweden's tabloids compete to examine the minutiae of Crown Princess Victoria's purported romantic attachments. King Carl Gustaf and Queen Silvia were infuriated two years ago when some Swedish newpapers published pictures of a thin-looking Victoria and suggested that she had an eating disorder. This month pictures evidently taken with a long lens were published of Victoria's younger sister, Madeleine, passionately embracing a friend on holiday.
 Royal Danes, however, are still treated more kindly--and their country's monarchy looks less vulnerable to republican assault. Crown Prince Frederik, a dashing 33-year-old, was last year voted ""man of the year"" for the fourth time in a row."," Two out of Scandinavia's three monarchies look a bit less secure

 THE Norwegians have sent a nervous shudder down the spines of Scandinavia's social democrats, who have ruled their respective roosts, with only occasional and brief hiccups, for the past 70 years. In fact, Norway's ruling Labour Party, as the country's social democrats are called, still won the general election on September 10th. But they drooped spectacularly, from 35% four years ago to 24%; four decades ago they got nearly half of all the votes. It will take a while for a new government to be formed, but there is a fair chance that a clutch of right-wing parties, perhaps led by the Conservatives, who got 21%, will take office.
 Despite his setback, Jens Stoltenberg, Norway's clever prime minister, who has led a minority government since last year, has refused to resign--yet. The voters, he rightly points out, have not spelt out their alternative. Indeed, Norwegians gave no fewer than five parties each more than 12% of the vote and enabled eight in all to take seats in parliament. ""Norwegian voters are like chickens without a head, rushing from one party to another in the hope of a miracle,"" says a pundit.
 They certainly veered to both left and right. The tally of the Socialist Left, the nearest thing in Norway to a communist party, doubled from 6% to 12%. It wants to spend a lot more of the country's vast revenues from oil and gas on sprucing up hospitals, schools and the country's already generous welfare state. By contrast, the Conservatives, led by Jan Petersen, a rather grey foreign-policy analyst, saw their score shoot up from 14% to 21%, with their calls for drastic tax cuts plainly striking a chord.
 This time the ticklish issue of whether Norway should join the European Union, which split the country down the middle in referendums in 1972 and 1994--both resulting in narrow No votes-- played little part in the campaign. The virulently anti-EU Centre Party saw its support slump by a third, to 6%.
 When parliament comes back in October, the Labour government may be replaced by a coalition of Conservatives, Christian Democrats and Liberals. Either Mr Petersen or the Christian Democrats' Kjell Magne Bondevik, who was prime minister from 1997 until he bowed out last year after taking time off for depression, will probably run the show.
 But it might not be plain sailing for a coalition crew on the right. Such a government would still need at least the occasional support of the right-wing populist Progressives, led by a veteran maverick, Carl I. Hagen. He matches the Conservatives with his calls for lower taxes and the Left Socialists with his demand that oil money should be spent on welfare, especially on pensioners. Mr Bondevik, however, would be loth to depend on the controversial Mr Hagen.
 Whoever takes office, do not expect Norway to change dramatically. Consensus will almost certainly reign as usual. The country is still awash with oil money. Though all governments, for fear of inflation, have kept much of the cash in a special pot, known as the Petroleum Fund, for the day when the oil runs out, many Norwegians now think that more of it should be spent on their dowdier schools, understaffed hospitals and run-down services for the old. A particular reason for Labour's decline was that instead of spending the oil money and cutting taxes, Mr Stoltenberg was trying to revamp the public sector--and promptly lost the backing of the powerful state-sector trade unions.
 This inconclusive election result may, oddly, give many Norwegians what they want: a weak government in thrall to an obstreperous and perhaps more populist legislature which may insist that more of the oil money should be dished out. Meanwhile, the social democrats' still-ruling counterparts in Denmark and Sweden will nervously wonder what lessons they can draw. The Danish lot, under the prime minister, Poul Nyrup Rasmussen, are flagging in the polls and face a general election by next March. The Swedish party, under Goran Persson, is better liked, but must face the voters' verdict within a year.","  The right may form the next Norwegian government

 HE BEGAN a second term as Norway's prime minister on October 19th, and Kjell Magne Bondevik knows where he does not want to take the nation. He and his rural-based Christian People's Party say that the basis for his new centre-right coalition government will cease to exist if either of the other parties in it, the Conservatives or the Liberals, puts membership of the European Union on the agenda.
 Where Mr Bondevik, an ordained minister in the Lutheran church, does wish to take his country is less clear. A friendly, decent man, and the most popular politician in Norway, he has a talent as a coalition builder, but he does not impress as a man of great political vision. His first administration is remembered for just two things: that it survived for 2 years to February 2000, while controlling only 42 of the 165 seats in the Storting (parliament); and that Mr Bondevik took 3 weeks off in late 1998 to be treated for depression.
 He will need his survival skills again. His party has 22 seats in the Storting elected last month. The Conservatives have 38, but yielded the prime ministership when he said there would be no coalition unless he headed it. Their leader, Jan Petersen, has to be content with foreign affairs. With two Liberals, Mr Bondevik can count on only 62 votes, and the support offered by 26 members of the populist Progress Party is conditional: its leader, Carl I. Hagen, has said he will give the coalition 12 months to prove its worth. And Labour, though battered by the voters, with 43 seats is still the largest party.
 Nor is policy exactly a guaranteed source of concord. The Conservatives want hefty tax cuts. Mr Bondevik's party wants to spend more on all manner of worthy causes, from schools, hospitals and the elderly to third-world aid. Since the public coffers are awash with revenues from offshore oil and gas, both parties will probably get what they want--unless, that is, the price of oil collapses.
 The real test of policy may lie elsewhere. Even now, Norway's public sector controls about 35% of the country's industrial production, and dominates national savings through the state petroleum fund, which holds oil and gas revenues surplus to current requirements. Reforms of state ownership were promised in Tuesday's government policy declaration to the Storting. But what reforms, exactly?
 One idea will come from the only unexpected new minister: Victor D. Norman, the country's leading academic economist and rector of its one significant business school, who became minister for labour and public administration. He recently co-wrote a book calling for reforms to reduce the power of the state. Further privatisation is unlikely, however. There may be some, but there is so little private- sector capital in Norway that selling giants, such as Statoil, the state oil company, would mean selling to foreigners. Professor Norman's recipe is to depoliticise state ownership by placing responsibility with foundations committed to managing state assets on a strictly commercial basis.

 ON NEW year's day, almost every hospital in Norway will be nationalised. By Kjell Magne Bondevik's new, right-leaning government? Yes: the 19 counties' public hospitals are hugely overspent. So the centre, through five regional boards, will take control. And private hospitals? They hardly exist--and hardly anyone, left or right, wants more of them. There, in a nutshell, is the dilemma of the country's far-reaching welfare state and, more widely, of its public sector.
 Both are large. Almost all health care and education, including 80% of the running costs of church schools, is state-provided. So are pensions, water, electricity, roads, railways and fixed-line telecoms. Beyond such traditionally public services, the state dominates in oil and gas, and has big stakes in manufacturing: it owns 45% of the country's industrial giant, Norsk Hydro (oil, gas, chemicals, fertilisers, aluminium) and 47% of Den norske Bank, the biggest commercial bank. Overall, the state holds about 40%, by value, of the local stockmarket. Plus $65 billion--roughly $14,500 per Norwegian--in the Petroleum Fund, a stockpile of recent years of earnings from North Sea oil, put aside for the day when the oil runs out. One worker in three, roughly, is in the public domain.
 So how does the new government begin to let in the market? The Labour-led government voted out in September had already sold about a fifth of both Statoil and Telenor, its till then 100%-state oil and telecoms businesses. Yet though the new team indeed plans further sales, the issue is not so much where and how, as how far and fast it wants to go and, politically or economically, is able to.
 Why bother? After all, ""state capitalism has worked pretty well,"" admits Victor D. Norman, a firmly pro-market minister plucked from the rectorship of a business school. State businesses have for years been told to act commercially--even the post office is now being pushed that way--and for the most part they do. True, the government appoints board members, but these days for their business qualities, not as political pals. ""It is hard to think of a country where the state has been so passive a stakeholder,"" says Eivind Reiten, a former energy minister who is now the chief executive of Norsk Hydro.
 The case for change, broadly accepted by right and left, is not to let in the market, but a new facet of it: private owners. The managers may be fine, but any management needs vigilant shareholders; and there is confusion, says Mr Norman, if that means the state. It may act as owner, but it is also the government; its businesses, and others, will wonder which hat it is wearing. Equally, its businesses want foreigners to see them as such, not state tools. That was why Labour sold chunks of Statoil and Telenor. Note the pragmatism of these reasons: just as Norway has few pure statists, it has few Thatcherites. Current plans for private-public partnerships to build and operate some new roads are broadly bipartisan. There is no wild dispute even over services such as schools and hospitals: you can set up private ones, just don't expect crowds of customers.
 The new team is readying its businesses for sell-offs, and wants parliament to let it cut its stake to a blocking 33%-plus in any of them. Yet it cannot sell fast. For one thing, Norway is short of private capital. The state is rich, but its over-taxed citizens have no huge pension funds to buy ex-state shares. This may alter. Pension reform is one of the big tasks ahead, and many ideas are afloat (and being studied, typically, by a commission under a Labour chairman). But none--short of simply handing out shares in the state's holdings to individual Norwegians--would allow full-scale privatisations overnight.
 Really not? Why not just put the shares up for sale and see who buys? Enter the real obstacle: most Norwegians, right or left, hate the idea of foreigners taking over Norway's natural resources. When Norsk Hydro in 1999 wanted to buy a sizeable oil company, it was allowed to issue new shares to pay for it, so cutting the state's stake below 50%. Parliament urged the government to buy more shares, so as to get above that level again--not to ensure public ownership, however, but Norwegian ownership.
 That's why the Labour government this year used Den norske Bank to block a Finnish bid for a big Norwegian insurer. It is why even Mr Bondevik's rightish team talks of keeping 33%-plus, not simply selling out--and why Labour now argues for more in some cases, saying that a blocking third may be fine in law but not in the real world, if other holders back a takeover.
 For an ironic example, take the central state's 100%-owned power generator, Statkraft. It happily buys chunks of local ones--there are 300, mostly locally owned. But ask its boss, Baard Mikkelsen, to imagine that it itself, tiny by world standards for its industry, were opened to a takeover. Some foreign giant would put in a bid next day, he says. Many stalwartly pro-market Norwegians would share his dislike of that. There are only 4.5m of them, and having twice voted to keep their country independent of the European Union, they have little mind to sit and watch global market forces gobble it up.","  Kjell Bondevik's can not rush to privatise

HE IS on a roll. Before last September's general election, the populist, free-marketeering Progress Party of Carl I. Hagen was being written off as a spent force, after a string of sex scandals and internecine feuding. In fact, it won 14.7% of the vote: a respectable score, but a little down on its 1997 figure, and far below some of its opinion-poll scores in the years between. Yet a poll last week gave it 36.3%--while, between them, the three parties of Norway's government scored only 23.7%.
How has it come about? For a start, says Bernt Aardal, professor of political science at Oslo University, Mr Hagen's party is the one that vacuums up voter discontent. And Norwegians are not happy at this moment. They feel let down by a government that promised tax cuts but failed to deliver. Mr Hagen, meanwhile, has both pandered to anti-immigrant sentiment and cast himself as the defender of the creaking but familiar welfare, education and health systems: in sum, here is the defender of the Norwegian way of life. 
And just as he once put on a decent performance as a tightrope walker in a circus some 15 years ago, Mr Hagen has learned to keep his footing in parliamentary politics. The minority centre-right government formed after the 2001 election by Kjell Magne Bondevik needs the Progress Party's votes to stay in power. It usually gets them--but not always. ""The Progress Party is both part of the power structure and outside it, and this has boosted Mr Hagen's popularity,"" says Professor Aardal. The party claims it has been enrolling new members at the rate of 600 a month.
The immediate trigger to the surge seems to the 2003 budget. The government presented a draft in early October. The prime minister said he would increase spending on health care, child care and foreign aid, but would not cut income taxes. Mr Bondevik, a teetotal Lutheran priest, also declined to reduce Norway's enormous levies on alcoholic drinks. 
Mr Hagen says the people can have their tax cuts, cheap booze, better highways, more prisons, affordable cars and fewer alms-seeking immigrants. All the government has to do, he says, is spend a little bit more, say 10 billion kroner more ($1.33 billion), of its huge ""petroleum fund"". This fund, which is expected to reach almost $90 billion by the end of this year, is where the state stashes the proceeds of its North Sea oil output. For 2003, the government is already planning to dip into this piggy-bank to make up a $4.6 billion budget deficit. But no more than that, it says: it is worried about inflation, the international competitiveness of the economy and depreciation of the krone. 
Whether it is right or wrong, this macroeconomic argument does not cut much ice with ordinary Norwegians. They think the government is just being mean. Whether they will go on backing Mr Hagen as far as the next general election, in 2005, is another matter. In Norway, as elsewhere, between elections discontented voters may express their woes forcefully through opinion polls, but when a real election comes round, they tend to revert to their familiar party preferences.

AS YOU travel around the Nordic countries, the money in your wallet tells its own story. Europhile Finns were delighted to be among the first wave of EU member countries to adopt the single currency, so you need euros to pay for your sauna or your plate of crayfish in Helsinki. The Danes, who have been in the European Union since 1973, narrowly turned down membership of the single currency in a referendum in September 2000, but the Danish krone is closely pegged to the euro, and euro notes and coins flowing over the border from Germany are widely accepted in shops and restaurants. So Danes are already getting used to the new currency, and polls show that two-thirds of them are ready to adopt it.
The picture is less clear in Sweden, which has been a member of the EU since 1995 but seems as reluctant as the British to embrace the common currency. If the Swedes vote yes in a referendum on September 14th, meatballs and aquavit in Stockholm will be sold for euros as early as 2006; but that remains a big if. The prime minister, Goran Persson, is leading the yes camp against a motley crew of sceptics. But despite a Swedish tendency to agree that those in authority usually know best, voters so far seem unconvinced.
Compared with the Norwegians, however, the Swedes look like uncritical Euro-enthusiasts. Norway's government twice applied for membership of the EU, only to be slapped down by oil-rich and fiercely patriotic voters at referendums in 1972 and 1994. The more recent vote proved painfully divisive, so political parties have mostly shunned the issue since. For the moment the Norwegian krone looks safe. Yet eventually even Norwegian Eurosceptics may be persuaded to change their minds. In recent months polls have shown growing support for joining the EU: leaving aside the don't knows, the yes camp is now in a majority.
The price of fish
If Norway were to join, super-sceptical Iceland would be left out alone. The island was originally settled by uppity Viking warriors who wanted to run their own show, and still preserves a strong national pride. But Iceland's main worry is that EU fishing directives would hurt its privately run and flourishing fish industry, which is central to its economy. The country is finding new sources of revenue (such as aluminium smelting and tourism) that might eventually ease its dependence on fish, but not for a while yet. However, if Norway, a rival exporter of fish, were to join the EU and get inside that big market, Iceland might choose to follow suit.
Many on the left of Nordic politics argue that moving closer to Europe would mean losing control over social policies (such as high taxes on alcohol). Soren Wibe, a Social Democrat MP in Sweden and an outspoken leader of the no campaign, says he fears adoption of the euro would eventually lead to a common European fiscal policy, ""so we would have to dismantle our welfare state quite a lot."" 
Such fears help to explain the persistent Nordic scepticism about wholehearted participation in the EU. One Danish observer of European politics says the aloof Nordics have long felt that they are better off and better run than the average European country, but they do worry about being isolated. The urban elite tend to think that closer ties with Europe make sense, but they must convince their more reluctant compatriots, especially in rural areas. Giving people a direct say can make a difference. For example, many Finns regret that, unlike the Danes, they never got the chance to express their views on the common currency in a referendum.
Still, there is no doubt that, of all the Nordic countries, the Finns are the greatest cheerleaders for the EU. A former Finnish prime minister, Aho Esko, talks of a ""EU-phoria when Finland was president of the Union"", once his countrymen had finally shaken off their fear that Russia might limit the country's role in Europe. ""Compared with 1809, when Russia took control of Finland from Sweden, joining the EU is nothing,"" says another Finn. 
Paavo Lipponen, the country's prime minister until April this year, believes his country has done well from joining both the union and the euro: Finland ""definitely benefits from the single currency. It is stability that has given us such confidence. I don't think [Sweden and Denmark] benefit from staying outside."" He offers Finland's recent economic prosperity as something to bear in mind for those considering euro membership. 
The new prime minister, Anneli Jaatteenmaki, is less voluble about things European, and one recent poll suggests that 68% of her countrymen think too much power has been handed to Brussels. But she is unlikely to make big policy changes, not least because her Centre Party must share power with the Europhile Mr Lipponen's Social Democrats.
Meanwhile in both Denmark and Sweden there is a growing consensus that membership of the EU is a good thing, despite some pain for small farmers. The prime ministers of both countries also favour joining the euro. Denmark's Anders Fogh Rasmussen thinks that staying outside the single currency has done his country no economic damage, but politically it has been a problem. ""We don't have a seat at the table where decisions are made."" He thinks public opinion is moving towards joining the euro: ""People realise that Denmark should be a fully fledged member of the EU to have full influence. And they realise the euro would be more practical."" 
But another referendum on adopting the single currency will be tricky, not least because questions loom on the country's other ""opt-outs""--from EU treaties on defence, citizenship, and justice and home affairs. Mr Fogh Rasmussen says the government aims to abolish the military opt-out, especially after seeing certain NATO tasks--such as peacekeeping in Macedonia--taken up by the EU. He promises another referendum on Europe in 2004 or 2005, though he has not yet decided if that is the right time for a ""big bang"" vote to end all remaining opt-outs. Although Danes seem ready for the euro, which they already have in much but name, and for military co-operation, they remain deeply sceptical about common policies on justice and home affairs (which would oblige them to give up some of their anti-immigration laws), and about the more symbolic question of being a citizen of the EU.
If Denmark were yet again to vote against adopting the euro, it might have to consider whether it can remain a member of the EU at all. There is a widespread assumption, both within the country itself and among other EU members, that Denmark's opt-outs are temporary and that the country is on the way to becoming a full and wholehearted member. Another public rejection would scotch that idea and prompt suggestions that Denmark should go for the ""Norwegian solution"" of associate membership instead. 
Meanwhile, though, the Danes can have fun watching the Swedes tie themselves in knots before the referendum on euro membership in September. Swedish voters and politicians, even within government, are deeply divided. For example, although the prime minister is in favour, the trade and industry minister, Leif Pagrotsky, is campaigning for a no vote. He says Sweden's economy is now doing better than euroland and that ""the Euro-sclerosis in Germany is not for us.""
Last November, when the referendum date was announced, polls showed a small majority in favour of joining. But that has since evaporated, just as it did in Denmark three years ago, and now the no camp seems to be in the ascendant. In April the main blue-collar trade-union organisation, LO, took offence at the government's refusal to put aside ""buffer funds"" to cover social costs arising from the transition, and said it would not campaign in favour.
Much now depends on Mr Persson's own yes campaign, which could swing a lot of undecided voters. He can count on support from pro-euro companies that will provide money for the campaign, and from many male white-collar workers. But he will have to rely mainly on the political case for joining--briefly, that Sweden outside the euro zone lacks influence in Europe--because the economic case is not clear-cut. 
Some economists, such as Klas Eklund at Skandinaviska Enskilda Banken, argue that Sweden's economy is in step with Europe, that interest rates set by the European Central Bank would suit it, and that the country would gain from a stable currency, more trade, higher growth and bigger markets within the euro zone. But others insist that gains would be marginal or non-existent. Mr Pagrotsky worries that ""Sweden would be less than 3% of the economy of the monetary union, and with a history of high inflation. Why drop the one effective anti-inflation measure?"" He believes that Sweden should sign up only if Britain were to join the single currency. 
Mr Persson may fear that if he campaigns strongly for a yes vote but is handed a no, his own standing will be damaged. He has been prime minister since 1996, was re-elected last year and is now the only Social Democrat to lead a government in the Nordic region. He may be loth to risk his popularity at the peak of his powers.
Whatever the Swedes decide, the campaign will encourage neighbouring Norway to rethink its position in Europe. Although a Swedish yes on the euro will not automatically help the pro-EU camp in Norway, it will prompt Norwegians to make up their minds. Already polls show that the group of undecided voters is shrinking, with the pro-EU camp picking up support.
One reason why Norwegians may want to consider EU membership anew is the price of food, which thanks to huge tariffs on some imported foodstuffs is one-third higher than in Sweden. Meat in Norway is so expensive that before Christmas families traditionally drive to Sweden to buy festive supplies of pork ribs and steaks. Because of limits on the amount of meat each person can import, children (known as fleskunger, or bacon kids) are crammed into the backs of cars to make the trip worthwhile. Norwegians are expected to spend NKr9 billion ($1.3 billion) over the border this year. 
But non-membership costs money in other ways too. Norway and Iceland have just been through tough renegotiations with the EU on the terms of their membership of the European Economic Area, which provides for free movement of goods, services, capital and labour between the Union and European countries (other than Switzerland) that have remained outside. From 2004 both countries will pay five times their present membership fee; Norway will also funnel existing bilateral aid for eastern Europe through the EU, so its total transfer to the Union will top NKr1.7 billion a year, a tenfold rise. 
Nor is money the only consideration. ""As well as paying in, Norway has now adopted an estimated 5,000 EU directives as its own law,"" says Jarle Hammerstad of HSH, a business organisation in Oslo. Even Norway's formerly sceptical prime minister, Kjell Magne Bondevik, has recently admitted he feels a ""dilemma"" over whether to apply to join. Most political parties are currently reconsidering the implications of membership.
EU enlargement to the east has also helped to change Norwegian perceptions of Europe. Haakon Kavli, a researcher with MMI, a polling organisation in Oslo, says the biggest shift in opinion towards membership has been in coastal areas. Many fishermen have traditionally been Eurosceptics, but many also sell to eastern Europe, and with those markets soon to become part of the EU they see more reason for Norway to join too.
Together, these trends suggest that Norway will reapply for membership, though not for a few years yet. Next year is too early, and 2005 will mark a century of Norwegian independence from Swedish colonial rule--not an auspicious time to hold a referendum on ceding some sovereignty to the EU. But a vote could come soon after. Terje Osmundsen, a political observer in Oslo, says he expects Norway to be in the EU by 2010.
It's cold outside
If so, Iceland, which already conducts 70% of its trade with the EU, would be unlikely to remain the only outsider for long. EU enthusiasts such as Eirikur Bergmann of Iceland's European Movement think a deal could be struck to preserve control over fish stocks. After all, Sweden and Finland persuaded the EU that their forestry industry near the Arctic circle should be given special treatment, so Iceland might get a similar deal for its fish. 
Mr Bergmann, like fellow Europhiles all over the Nordic region, believes that voters will be swayed by the political argument: ""Iceland takes 80% of EU legislation but we have no say. We have outsourced part of our legislature to Brussels."" But the most persuasive reason for joining may be the prospect of the single currency: Iceland's krona is volatile and the country is prone to inflation, so interest rates yo-yoed over the years. A survey in February of members of the Federation of Icelandic Industries showed that 59% were in favour of the euro. However, the re-election on May 10th of David Oddsson, prime minister for the past 12 years and an outspoken opponent of EU membership for Iceland, has boosted the anti camp.
Caption: Why Norway and Iceland haven't joined the EU","Relations with the EU are warming a little 
 AS YOU travel around the Nordic countries , the money in your wallet tells its own story . Europhile Finns were delighted to be among the first wave of EU member countries to adopt the single currency , so you need euros to pay for your sauna or your plate of crayfish in Helsinki . The Danes , who have been in the European Union since 1973 , narrowly turned down membership of the single currency in a referendum in September 2000 , but the Danish krone is closely pegged to the euro , and euro notes and coins flowing over the border from Germany are widely accepted in shops and restaurants . So Danes are already getting used to the new currency , and polls show that two - thirds of them are ready to adopt it . 
 The picture is less clear in Sweden , which has been a member of the EU since 1995 but seems as reluctant as the British to embrace the common currency . If the Swedes vote yes in a referendum on September 14th , meatballs and aquavit in Stockholm will be sold for euros as early as 2006 ; but that remains a big if . The prime minister , Goran Persson , is leading the yes camp against a motley crew of sceptics . But despite a Swedish tendency to agree that those in authority usually know best , voters so far seem unconvinced . 
 Compared with the Norwegians , however , the Swedes look like uncritical Euro - enthusiasts . Norway 's government twice applied for membership of the EU , only to be slapped down by oil - rich and fiercely patriotic voters at referendums in 1972 and 1994 . The more recent vote proved painfully divisive , so political parties have mostly shunned the issue since . For the moment the Norwegian krone looks safe . Yet eventually even Norwegian Eurosceptics may be persuaded to change their minds . In recent months polls have shown growing support for joining the EU : leaving aside the do n't knows , the yes camp is now in a majority . 
 The price of fish 
 If Norway were to join , super - sceptical Iceland would be left out alone . The island was originally settled by uppity Viking warriors who wanted to run their own show , and still preserves a strong national pride . But Iceland 's main worry is that EU fishing directives would hurt its privately run and flourishing fish industry , which is central to its economy . The country is finding new sources of revenue ( such as aluminium smelting and tourism ) that might eventually ease its dependence on fish , but not for a while yet . However , if Norway , a rival exporter of fish , were to join the EU and get inside that big market , Iceland might choose to follow suit . 
 Many on the left of Nordic politics argue that moving closer to Europe would mean losing control over social policies ( such as high taxes on alcohol ) . Soren Wibe , a Social Democrat MP in Sweden and an outspoken leader of the no campaign , says he fears adoption of the euro would eventually lead to a common European fiscal policy , "" so we would have to dismantle our welfare state quite a lot . "" 
 Such fears help to explain the persistent Nordic scepticism about wholehearted participation in the EU . One Danish observer of European politics says the aloof Nordics have long felt that they are better off and better run than the average European country , but they do worry about being isolated . The urban elite tend to think that closer ties with Europe make sense , but they must convince their more reluctant compatriots , especially in rural areas . Giving people a direct say can make a difference . For example , many Finns regret that , unlike the Danes , they never got the chance to express their views on the common currency in a referendum . 
 Still , there is no doubt that , of all the Nordic countries , the Finns are the greatest cheerleaders for the EU . A former Finnish prime minister , Aho Esko , talks of a "" EU - phoria when Finland was president of the Union "" , once his countrymen had finally shaken off their fear that Russia might limit the country 's role in Europe . "" Compared with 1809 , when Russia took control of Finland from Sweden , joining the EU is nothing , "" says another Finn . 
 Paavo Lipponen , the country 's prime minister until April this year , believes his country has done well from joining both the union and the euro : Finland "" definitely benefits from the single currency . It is stability that has given us such confidence . I do n't think [ Sweden and Denmark ] benefit from staying outside . "" He offers Finland 's recent economic prosperity as something to bear in mind for those considering euro membership . 
 The new prime minister , Anneli Jaatteenmaki , is less voluble about things European , and one recent poll suggests that 68 % of her countrymen think too much power has been handed to Brussels . But she is unlikely to make big policy changes , not least because her Centre Party must share power with the Europhile Mr Lipponen 's Social Democrats . 
 Meanwhile in both Denmark and Sweden there is a growing consensus that membership of the EU is a good thing , despite some pain for small farmers . The prime ministers of both countries also favour joining the euro . Denmark 's Anders Fogh Rasmussen thinks that staying outside the single currency has done his country no economic damage , but politically it has been a problem . "" We do n't have a seat at the table where decisions are made . "" He thinks public opinion is moving towards joining the euro : "" People realise that Denmark should be a fully fledged member of the EU to have full influence . And they realise the euro would be more practical . "" 
 But another referendum on adopting the single currency will be tricky , not least because questions loom on the country 's other "" opt - outs""--from EU treaties on defence , citizenship , and justice and home affairs . Mr Fogh Rasmussen says the government aims to abolish the military opt - out , especially after seeing certain NATO tasks -- such as peacekeeping in Macedonia -- taken up by the EU . He promises another referendum on Europe in 2004 or 2005 , though he has not yet decided if that is the right time for a "" big bang "" vote to end all remaining opt - outs . Although Danes seem ready for the euro , which they already have in much but name , and for military co - operation , they remain deeply sceptical about common policies on justice and home affairs ( which would oblige them to give up some of their anti - immigration laws ) , and about the more symbolic question of being a citizen of the EU . 
 If Denmark were yet again to vote against adopting the euro , it might have to consider whether it can remain a member of the EU at all . There is a widespread assumption , both within the country itself and among other EU members , that Denmark 's opt - outs are temporary and that the country is on the way to becoming a full and wholehearted member . Another public rejection would scotch that idea and prompt suggestions that Denmark should go for the "" Norwegian solution "" of associate membership instead . 
 Meanwhile , though , the Danes can have fun watching the Swedes tie themselves in knots before the referendum on euro membership in September . Swedish voters and politicians , even within government , are deeply divided . For example , although the prime minister is in favour , the trade and industry minister , Leif Pagrotsky , is campaigning for a no vote . He says Sweden 's economy is now doing better than euroland and that "" the Euro - sclerosis in Germany is not for us . "" 
 Last November , when the referendum date was announced , polls showed a small majority in favour of joining . But that has since evaporated , just as it did in Denmark three years ago , and now the no camp seems to be in the ascendant . In April the main blue - collar trade - union organisation , LO , took offence at the government 's refusal to put aside "" buffer funds "" to cover social costs arising from the transition , and said it would not campaign in favour . 
 Much now depends on Mr Persson 's own yes campaign , which could swing a lot of undecided voters . He can count on support from pro - euro companies that will provide money for the campaign , and from many male white - collar workers . But he will have to rely mainly on the political case for joining -- briefly , that Sweden outside the euro zone lacks influence in Europe -- because the economic case is not clear - cut . 
 Some economists , such as Klas Eklund at Skandinaviska Enskilda Banken , argue that Sweden 's economy is in step with Europe , that interest rates set by the European Central Bank would suit it , and that the country would gain from a stable currency , more trade , higher growth and bigger markets within the euro zone . But others insist that gains would be marginal or non - existent . Mr Pagrotsky worries that "" Sweden would be less than 3 % of the economy of the monetary union , and with a history of high inflation . Why drop the one effective anti - inflation measure ? "" He believes that Sweden should sign up only if Britain were to join the single currency . 
 Mr Persson may fear that if he campaigns strongly for a yes vote but is handed a no , his own standing will be damaged . He has been prime minister since 1996 , was re - elected last year and is now the only Social Democrat to lead a government in the Nordic region . He may be loth to risk his popularity at the peak of his powers . 
 Whatever the Swedes decide , the campaign will encourage neighbouring Norway to rethink its position in Europe . Although a Swedish yes on the euro will not automatically help the pro - EU camp in Norway , it will prompt Norwegians to make up their minds . Already polls show that the group of undecided voters is shrinking , with the pro - EU camp picking up support . 
 One reason why Norwegians may want to consider EU membership anew is the price of food , which thanks to huge tariffs on some imported foodstuffs is one - third higher than in Sweden . Meat in Norway is so expensive that before Christmas families traditionally drive to Sweden to buy festive supplies of pork ribs and steaks . Because of limits on the amount of meat each person can import , children ( known as fleskunger , or bacon kids ) are crammed into the backs of cars to make the trip worthwhile . Norwegians are expected to spend NKr9 billion ( $ 1.3 billion ) over the border this year . 
 But non - membership costs money in other ways too . Norway and Iceland have just been through tough renegotiations with the EU on the terms of their membership of the European Economic Area , which provides for free movement of goods , services , capital and labour between the Union and European countries ( other than Switzerland ) that have remained outside . From 2004 both countries will pay five times their present membership fee ; Norway will also funnel existing bilateral aid for eastern Europe through the EU , so its total transfer to the Union will top NKr1.7 billion a year , a tenfold rise . 
 Nor is money the only consideration .

THE alcohol stores in Helsingor struggle to close on time, as Swedes cram in to grab a few more bottles before heading back across the Oresund strait that divides these Nordic neighbours. Trade in the stores has doubled since Denmark cut taxes on spirits by 45% at the start of October. Its action is inexorably chipping away at the entire Nordic region's restrictive alcohol regime.
The Danish government, itself trying to discourage people from heading across the border to Germany to buy cheap booze, felt it had no choice. Even after the tax cut, the incentives for drinkers to go abroad are powerful. A bottle of Bells Extra Special Scotch, priced at NKr270 ($38) in Norway, can be had for NKr225 in Sweden, NKr117 in Denmark and just NKr90 in Germany.
Sweden is deeply worried. In the 19th century, a lethal cocktail mixing the misery caused by industrialisation with cheap spirits helped to set off endemic alcohol abuse. Total prohibition was only narrowly defeated in a referendum in 1922. Alcohol was rationed until 1955. Strong beer, wine and spirits remain heavily taxed, and retail sales are still conducted through a limited number of state monopoly stores. Similar systems exist in Finland and Norway. Temperance movements have a strong political foothold in all three Scandinavian countries.
Since their entry into the European Union in 1995, Sweden and Finland have struggled to protect their alcohol regimes, as import restrictions have been gradually lifted under single-market rules. In Sweden consumption has risen to levels not seen since 1875. Hakan Leifman, a researcher at Stockholm University, says Swedes over 15 now consume around ten litres of pure alcohol a year, still well below the 14-15 litres per year in Ireland, but closing in on the EU average of 12. Other measures aimed at limiting sales have also fallen foul of EU rules. Earlier this year Sweden's ban on the advertising of strong beer, wine and spirits was overruled.
So far there is little evidence of a more ""sophisticated"" European attitude to alcohol: ""binge drinking"" remains the Scandinavian way. Public-health organisations are alarmed, predicting a rise in alcohol-related violence, drink-driving and chronic alcohol-related diseases.
But with Swedes in the south of the country bringing in booze from Denmark, and a virtual scrapping of controls on such imports coming in January, Bosse Ringholm, the (teetotal) finance minister, faces a dilemma. Even Sweden's state alcohol stores are campaigning for a tax cut. If Mr Ringholm does not oblige, he will lose revenues and foster an environment for illegal reselling. But if he does, cheaper alcohol will be available throughout the country. The Finnish prime minister, Matti Vanhanen, is duly proposing steep tax cuts in January, in an effort to stem imports. 
Similar arguments are being heard even in non-EU Norway. The country has maintained its import control of one litre of spirits per person. But since it has scrapped most of its border checks, Norway has now become a nation of petty smugglers. Few expect the prime minister, Kjell Magne Bondevik, a teetotal Lutheran priest, to jump at the idea of a tax cut. Some have suggested that the answer is to reimpose border controls. But if the Swedes do cut prices it will be hard for Norway to stand against the tide. One way or another, cheaper alcohol is coming.","How Europe's single market makes boozing cheaper

ON MAY 5th, shareholders in Britain Inc will vote for their next chief executive. Apart from the sheer kick of running a country, what's the pay like for the job? Lousy, according to a study of European political leaders by Hay Group, a human-resources consultancy.
In terms of his (for such it will be) take-home pay, Britain's next prime minister will earn pounds 178,900 a year. This is 4% less than Gerhard Schroder, the German chancellor, but 63% more than Costas Karamanlis, the prime minister of Greece (see chart). 
Top political jobs, however, vary according to the size of the country (how many customers for your services), its geopolitical significance (how much travel involved) and its internal structure (how much work can be fobbed off to others). Taking such factors into account, and the element of job-sharing in countries such as France that have an executive president and a prime minister, Hay has graded the size of the top political jobs around Europe and found that of the British prime minister to be the biggest of them all, in a class of its own. 
The consultants then asked what leaders with jobs of that size might expect to earn in the private sectors in their own countries. And here Britain's prime minister comes off badly, earning only 8% of what he could expect heading a big company like BP or Unilever. Norway's prime minister, Kjell Magne Bondevik, earns 31% of what he could expect for a comparable private-sector job in Norway. On this ranking, only Poland's leader does worse than Britain's.
Political leaders can hope to catch up on their forgone earnings in later life, after they have retired from office. A public-sector pension (defined in Dr Johnson's dictionary as ""pay given to a state hireling for treason to his country"") is generally generous, and former leaders can expect to be in demand from publishers and on the lecture circuit. Sir (since last weekend) John Major, Britain's most recent ex-prime minister, tours the world in a private jet with a full-time chief-of-staff, lecturing to the likes of the American Dental Association and the Tax-Free World Association on timeless subjects such as ""The Changing World"".

As authorities scaled back their estimate of the region's death toll, George Bush paid two visits to the deluged city (he had previously visited the Gulf coast region) to view the operations. Michael Brown resigned as head of the much criticised Federal Emergency Management Agency. 
The Senate held its confirmation hearings for John Roberts to be chief justice of the Supreme Court. Following the script, Democrats quizzed him on his attitude towards abortion and civil rights.
The Massachusetts legislature voted against a proposed state constitutional amendment that would ban gay marriage, which is legal in the state because of a court ruling. The measure now looks unlikely to be put to the electorate next year. 
Fernando Ferrer won the Democratic primary in New York's mayoral election, after the second-placed candidate withdrew to avoid a divisive run-off. Mr Ferrer could become the city's first Latino mayor if he beats Michael Bloomberg in November.
World leaders meeting in New York were due to endorse a 35-page declaration on overhauling the United Nations and progress towards tackling world poverty. Although greatly watered down in comparison with earlier drafts, the final document was described by both Kofi Annan, the UN secretary-general, and Mr Bush as an important ""first step"" along the road to reform. Others were more dubious.
Paying the bill
In Brazil, opposition parties began proceedings to expel Severino Cavalcanti, the leader of the lower house of Congress. He is accused of extorting payments from a concessionaire who ran restaurants in the Congress building. An unrelated campaign-finance scandal involving the Workers' Party continues to erode the popularity of the government. 
Suez, a French utility, said it would withdraw from Argentina, where it held 46% of a large water company, after failing to reach agreement with the government over an increase in tariffs, which have been frozen since 2002. 
In Canada, Ontario's government said that it would not allow Muslims to use sharia law to settle family disputes; instead, it will move to outlaw religious tribunals used by Christians and Jews. 
Chile's Supreme Court ruled that General Augusto Pinochet can face a third set of human-rights charges, though he is likely to escape trial on health grounds. The Guardian, a British newspaper, claimed that BAE Systems paid the former dictator more than pounds 1m ($1.6m) from 1997 to 2004.
Up for grabs
The opinion polls continued to narrow days ahead of Germany's election. Most now suggest that the opposition will not win an overall majority, making the likeliest outcome a ""grand coalition"" between the main centre-right and centre-left parties.
Norway voted the centre-left into office in a general election. Jens Stoltenberg, leader of the Labour Party, will now form a government, ousting the centre-right government of Kjell Magne Bondevik.
The European Court of Justice ruled that the European Commission could, in some circumstances, impose criminal penalties on those who flout European Union laws. The ruling was opposed by many national governments, which argued that the criminal law should never fall within EU powers. 
Northern Ireland witnessed its worse riots for years after a parade by the Orange Order was re-routed to avoid a Catholic neighbourhood. Around 80 police officers were hurt in the ensuing violence. The province's top policeman said the Order and loyalist paramilitaries had instigated the trouble; they blame the police.
European finance ministers vowed to stand together against fuel-price protesters who are demanding cuts in petrol taxes. But several countries promptly offered subsidies and tax rebates to favoured pressure groups.
The carnage continues
In one of the deadliest days in Iraq since the American-led invasion in 2003, at least 150 people were killed and hundreds more injured in a series of bomb attacks and shootings on September 14th. In the worst incident, a suicidebomber blew up his car in the midst of hundreds of labourers, killing at least 114. Al-Qaeda in Iraq claimed responsibility for the mayhem.
Hosni Mubarak won what was billed as Egypt's first competitive presidential election with 88.6% of the vote. His main rival in the race, Ayman Nour, won just 7.6% and cried foul. Even more strikingly, only 23% of the electorate bothered to vote.
There were anarchic scenes in the Gaza strip as the last Israeli soldiers left. Former Israeli settlements were looted and a synagogue was burned to the ground. Palestinian leader Mahmoud Abbas condemned the ""armed chaos"". 
In oil-rich Nigeria, thousands of people took to the streets in the city of Lagos to protest against a rise of 30% in fuel costs due to cuts in government subsidies.

FOUR years ago Norway's Labour Party suffered its worst election defeat since 1924. Yet the party, now led by Jens Stoltenberg, won the election on September 12th. Mr Stoltenberg will now form the country's first majority government in two decades. He and his two allied parties romped home with 87 of the parliament's 169 seats among them, giving him a comfortable majority over the outgoing centre-right coalition led by Kjell Magne Bondevik. 
Mr Stoltenberg served a brief stint as prime minister five years ago. Yet the real question is not why he won, but why Mr Bondevik lost. Unemployment is low, wages are high, education is free and the United Nations has once again ranked Norway as the best country in which to live. This enviable lifestyle is largely bankrolled by North Sea oil, the proceeds of which are stashed away in a Petroleum Fund now worth NKr1.2 trillion ($190 billion), and rising fast. Non-oil business is also booming: a survey of some 114,000 non-oil companies shows an average 43.9% increase in profits. 
Yet many of Norway's 3.4m-odd voters do not share the view that they live in nirvana. With all that oil wealth, they cannot understand why the welfare system has so many defects. There is a shortage of kindergartens, hospitals are understaffed, taxes are high, petrol costs as much as in non-oil countries and pensioners have problems making ends meet. A groundswell of such discontent swung the election Mr Stoltenberg's way. He made a string of lavish promises to cut child-care costs, guarantee kindergarten places, extend maternity and paternity leave and even hand out free fruit to schoolchildren. 
It is easy to exaggerate Norway's leftward swing, however. Indeed, overall the right actually won more votes but fewer seats. A crucial factor was that Carl Hagen, the populist leader of the far right Progress Party, had his best ever election, taking his party's representation from 26 seats to 38 to become the second-biggest in parliament. Mr Hagen held the balance of power in the outgoing parliament and used it to full effect to squeeze concessions from the government. He has now lost that position.
Even so, over the next few weeks, Mr Stoltenberg may find it hard to form a coherent government. Besides divvying up cabinet posts, his three-party coalition must find common ground on some key policies. Labour is pro-European Union, its two partners are Europhobes. Labour favours gas-fired power generation, the others fret about pollution. Despite his election promises, Mr Stoltenberg is cautious about raiding the Petroleum Fund. Mr Bondevik, retired from the limelight to his rocking chair, will surely be praying for an unholy falling-out among the three new friends that might yet let the centre-right back in.

THE secretive ex-guerrilla government has always been good at concealing its real intentions. But Eritrea's policy on aid has become unusually bizarre. One of the poorest countries in the world, with some of its population now facing food shortages, Eritrea is deliberately rejecting help. 
This week, the United Nations special humanitarian envoy for the Horn of Africa, Kjell Magne Bondevik, made his first visit to Eritrea, where the UN faces a tricky dilemma. Eritreans are tired and hungry, but the government sticks to a mantra of self-reliance. 
In early 2005, the UN estimated that two-thirds of Eritrea's 3.6m people needed food aid, making Eritrea one of the most food-aid-dependent countries in the world. No independent survey has been allowed since then, but aid-workers say that this year's better harvest is still not nearly enough to feed the country. Nobody is starving just yet, they say, but the signs of widespread hunger are showing. 
Rather than engaging with foreign governments and international agencies, however, Eritrea expelled the United States Agency for International Development last year, slashed the numbers receiving food aid from 1.3m to 72,000, and has now told at least 11 other international aid organisations to stop their work. Meanwhile, food aid is rotting in the warehouses and further imports have slowed to a trickle.
The government insists that it is best qualified to look after the interests of its own people, and accuses the UN of trying to distract attention from its own failures. Six years ago, at the end of a brutal border war, Ethiopia and Eritrea agreed to respect an international ruling, supported by the UN, that would fix their common frontier. To Eritrea's fury, Ethiopia refuses to accept the ruling without further talks. Eritrea cannot hope to win another fight against its much bigger neighbour. So it has turned its wrath on the UN and the West instead, accusing them of failing to press Ethiopia into compliance. This week, Eritrea's government refused Mr Bondevik's request to release the food aid that is stacked in its warehouses.
Last year Eritrea grounded UN helicopters in the demarcation zone abutting Ethiopia, and expelled several peacekeepers. The heightened tensions brought international interest, but little real progress has been made towards resolving the issue. 
At best, analysts question the government's competence. At worst, they now question its intentions, especially towards its own people. Last month an Eritrean presidential spokesman was quoted as suggesting, bizarrely, that the latest order to three large international agencies to stop their work could somehow improve efficiency and maximise the impact of aid. But the affected agencies--the American Mercy Corps, the Irish charity Concern, and Acord, a British group--have done some of the best work in Eritrea, providing support for tens of thousands of vulnerable people in some of the country's most inaccessible areas.
Government restrictions on travel in the country mean that aid-workers are often the only foreigners to reach the remoter regions. So expelling the three charities may be one way of muzzling reports of any impending humanitarian disaster. If Africa's youngest country cannot achieve self-reliance in practice, it can at least seek to create the illusion of it.","Eritrea 's people pay the price for their government 's pride

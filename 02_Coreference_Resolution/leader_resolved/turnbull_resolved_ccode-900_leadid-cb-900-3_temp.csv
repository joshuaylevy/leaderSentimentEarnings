JUST 18 months after Tony Abbott became Australia's prime minister, pundits are writing his political obituary. A string of gaffes, disastrous polls and bitter divisions within his conservative Liberal Party sparked a motion last month to open his leadership to a party ballot. He survived, just. But the drama continues to feed a febrile mood in Canberra, the capital. On March 2nd an opinion poll gave Mr Abbott some breathing space. For how long is another matter. 
The Ipsos poll showed the Liberals and their coalition partner, the National Party, trailing the opposition Labor Party by only two percentage points, after including second-preference votes. A month earlier the government had lagged by eight points. Mr Abbott's personal approval rating edged up slightly, though only to a measly 32%. His allies jumped to defend him. Andrew Robb, the minister for trade and investment, says that in the poll the voters ""have spoken"" and that the push by colleagues to topple the prime minister is ""dying"". 
That may be optimistic. Asked who they would like to lead the Liberals, 39% of voters chose Malcolm Turnbull, the communications minister, and 24% chose Julie Bishop, the foreign minister. Just 19% plumped for Mr Abbott. Some pollsters read the rise in positive sentiment towards the government as a sign that some voters expect to see Mr Turnbull in charge before the next election, due in 2016. 
Backed by the Liberals' conservative wing, Mr Abbott unseated the centrist Mr Turnbull as party leader in 2009. In the latest jostling, Mr Turnbull has taken a steady approach that voters seem to prefer to Mr Abbott's street-fighting style. A telling clash came over a recent report by Australia's Human Rights Commission that criticised both Labor and coalition governments for locking child asylum-seekers in detention centres. Mr Abbott responded by attacking the commission's boss, Gillian Triggs. Mr Turnbull defended Ms Triggs as a ""very distinguished"" legal scholar, adding that the main issue ""is the children"". 
Ordinary Australians have never really taken to Mr Abbott. But he also has problems in his cabinet. His colleagues resent the power wielded by his chief of staff, Peta Credlin. She happens to be married to the Liberal Party's director, Brian Loughnane. A leaked memo from the party treasurer to Liberal party officials fretted about a potential conflict of interest. The press have made much of the leak as an apparent attempt to damage Mr Abbott. He dismissed it as a storm in a teacup. 
After the respite produced by the latest poll, Mr Abbott issued a flurry of policy announcements. He pledged 300 more Australian troops for Iraq, on top of 170 special forces there now, to serve with about 100 New Zealand soldiers training the Iraqi army. A much-ballyhooed report was published about the pressure on budgets that can be expected from an ageing population over the next 40 years. And the prime minister finally dropped one of the most unpopular measures in his government's first budget last year: a plan to charge those using public health insurance for visiting doctors. 
Mr Robb says the Liberals will now give Mr Abbott ""clear air"" to carry on as leader until the next budget, due in May, ""and beyond"". Other colleagues are less happy with that prospect, given that the first budget was bungled between Mr Abbott and his treasurer, Joe Hockey. Moreover, a state election is due on March 28th in New South Wales, Mr Abbott's home state, which is currently governed by the Liberals. Recent defeats of one-term conservative state governments in Victoria and Queensland have rocked the Liberals. If Mike Baird, the popular state premier, does badly, the ""Abbott effect"" could take most of the blame.

EDDIE RICHARDSON has lived in the same council flat on Woodberry Down council estate in north London since 1961. Mr Richardson, who worked all his life for London Underground, pays Pounds 100 ($150) per week in rent, less than half the market rent in the area. But he, like his neighbours, is waiting to find out when he will have to move from his flat, as it is demolished and reconstructed, and whether he will get a flat on the newly built estate. It is part of a wave of state-led gentrification of council estates that has brought accusations of ""social cleansing"" of the working class from central London. 
Though hardly a hotbed of crime and drugs, Woodberry's brutalist backdrop gained a degree of notoriety as the set for the Warsaw ghetto in ""Schindler's List"", a film about the second world war. It was built in 1948 at the start of the post-war boom in council-housing construction. One newspaper in 1953 called Woodberry ""the estate of the future"". Yet, though high-rise, London council estates are often surprisingly low density. Woodberry covers 64 acres (26 hectares) and originally contained 2,500 flats. The new estate, when complete in 2032, will have more than double that number. 
The regeneration comes with a twist, though. Begun by the Labour government of Tony Blair and continued by the coalition since 2010, it came about because of the estates' deterioration on the one hand, and the lack of cheap land on the other. Strapped for cash and with limited resources to plan and build, local authorities turned to private developers--in Hackney's case Berkeley Group, London's biggest. The price for allowing Berkeley to develop Woodberry is that it is allowed to sell 60% of the new flats on the open market, leaving just 40% as affordable housing. Blocks of shiny flats for private sale have been built first (see picture). 
Existing tenants (most of whom are paying 30-40% of market rent) should have a ""right to return"" to a flat in the newly reconstructed estate. But, on some estates, boroughs have struck poor deals with the private developers. The Heygate estate in south London originally had about 1,200 council flats. They will be replaced by 2,500 units, of which around just 80 are for social tenants. That means many previous tenants have had to move out, some to the suburbs. Those who bought the leasehold on their council flat under the ""right to buy"" scheme implemented by Margaret Thatcher in the 1980s are even worse off. Former leaseholders do not have the right to return and some have had to accept below-market compensation for the flat they were encouraged to buy. 
Whereas the arrondissements of central Paris consist of 1-7% social housing, boroughs in central London include 26% social housing in Westminster and 45% in Hackney, where Woodberry is located. But now, says Mr Richardson, ""the traditional working class is being squeezed out."" 
The trend is expected to grow as land values continue to rise. Islington council alone has 150 council estates of 50 homes or more--comprising 40% of the borough's total housing--on some of the most expensive land in the world. A 77-acre site in Earl's Court, in west London, including a couple of council estates, is about to be developed amid similar concerns. (Cities outside London are less affected as the surge in land price has been less extreme.) 
Meanwhile, London's housing shortage gets more desperate. The city needs a minimum of around 50,000 new homes annually. Last year it built about half that number. The government has also made a linguistic change, merging the concept of social housing with ""affordable housing"" (properties available at 80% market rent). By making ""affordable"" a category rather than a meaningful adjective, says Pat Turnbull of the London Tenants' Federation, the authorities are removing the requirement to provide social rented homes in London at all. As the volume of council flats continues to shrink, 95% of government spending on housing during the course of this parliament (Pounds 21 billion this year) will go through the benefits system, while just 5% is invested in new homes. 
Loretta Lees of the University of Leicester says that council tenants are often presented with a ""false choice"" between a regeneration they do not want and the further deterioration of their housing. She believes many of the estates are structurally sound and could be refurbished. Tenants' representatives accuse the Labour Party of not standing up for working-class people. On March 24th, Labour's housing guru, Andrew Adonis, published a report for IPPR, a think-tank, praising this model for regenerating estates, calling them potential ""city villages"". Professor Lees calls the report ""another gentrifier's charter"". Once again, Woodberry Down could be the estate of the future.

THAT Australia now has its fourth prime minister, Malcolm Turnbull, in little more than two years should be a worry--especially when you consider the manner in which all his predecessors were turfed out. Tony Abbott came to power in a general election in 2013, ending six years of Labor Party dominance, in part by claiming that his (conservative) Liberal-National coalition was above the kind of fratricide that had seen Labor's prime minister, Kevin Rudd, ousted by his rival, Julia Gillard, only for him to get his revenge by re-ousting Ms Gillard when opinion polls turned against Labor. Now Mr Turnbull has done to Mr Abbott what Mr Rudd and Ms Gillard did to each other--only with exceptional cold-bloodedness and guile (see page 52). 
The good news is that Mr Turnbull could prove the most competent leader since John Howard, who served 11 years before his coalition's defeat in an election in 2007. Had Mr Turnbull led the Liberals into the latest general election (he lost the Liberal Party leadership to Mr Abbott by a single vote), The Economist would have endorsed him rather than Mr Rudd, a bright mind but a lousy operator. Having made his money in law and business, Mr Turnbull has solid pro-market credentials. Unlike Mr Abbott, who downplays the risks of climate change, he sets store by using market mechanisms to bring down carbon emissions (per person, Australians are among the world's highest emitters). As a social liberal, he is closer to most Australians than was Mr Abbott, who is opposed to gay marriage. And in foreign policy, he will be less ""Manichean"", as one expert put it: less inclined to see the world--including China's rise--only through the prism of security. 
For the time being the new prime minister is signalling more a change of tone than of policy. He has replaced Mr Abbott's sneering negativism with more hopeful rhetoric--declaring, for instance, that these are ""exciting times"" to be Australian. Above all, he says he will provide competence and leadership at a time when, after more than two decades of unbroken growth, Australia's economy is slowing--crimped, not least, by the slowdown in its largest overseas market, China. Australia needs investment in services and new industries if it is to shift from an over-reliance on exporting iron ore and coal--the hope is that consistent pro-business government will help that where Mr Abbott's repeated U-turns hindered it. But the general election is due in less than a year. Mr Turnbull does not have long to prove that he can lead an effective government. 
Conviction politics 
A natural question to ask is whether the economy can be fixed without also mending a political system that produces so many revolving-door prime ministers. Three-year parliamentary terms are extremely short and would seem an obvious culprit. Yet they used not to prevent strong leaders from emerging--Mr Howard for one. 
Certainly, subsequent leaders--not least Mr Howard's protege, Mr Abbott--have been made of thinner stuff. But that is only part of the answer. The old class-bound lines, along which Liberal and Labor loyalties once ran, have gone. Both parties are now hunting on the same ground, among an urban, educated swing-voting middle class. When confronted by the findings of the latest opinion polls or focus groups, the parties' tendency is to panic; the next election is never far away. 
This is not healthy. Australia should now debate lengthening the parliamentary term. And Mr Turnbull must prove that connecting with the middle ground--which Mr Abbott abandoned--is a better method of governing than jumping at every opinion poll. Australians may even reward him for it.","Malcolm Turnbull ousts Tony Abbott at a critical juncture for the economy . Why so many political murders ?

Now Malcolm Turnbull has done to Mr Abbott what Mr Rudd and Ms Gillard did to each other -- only with exceptional cold - bloodedness and guile ( see page 52 ) . 
 The good news is that Malcolm Turnbull could prove the most competent leader since John Howard , who served 11 years before his coalition 's defeat in an election in 2007 . Had Malcolm Turnbull led the Liberals into the latest general election ( Malcolm Turnbull lost the Liberal Party leadership to Mr Abbott by a single vote ) , The Economist would have endorsed Malcolm Turnbull rather than Mr Rudd , a bright mind but a lousy operator . Having made Malcolm Turnbull's money in law and business , Malcolm Turnbull has solid pro - market credentials . Unlike Mr Abbott , who downplays the risks of climate change , Malcolm Turnbull sets store by using market mechanisms to bring down carbon emissions ( per person , Australians are among the world 's highest emitters ) . As a social liberal , Malcolm Turnbull is closer to most Australians than was Mr Abbott , who is opposed to gay marriage . And in foreign policy , Malcolm Turnbull will be less "" Manichean "" , as one expert put it : less inclined to see the world -- including China 's rise -- only through the prism of security . 
 For the time being Malcolm Turnbull is signalling more a change of tone than of policy . Malcolm Turnbull has replaced Mr Abbott 's sneering negativism with more hopeful rhetoric -- declaring , for instance , that these are "" exciting times "" to be Australian . Above all , Malcolm Turnbull says Malcolm Turnbull will provide competence and leadership at a time when , after more than two decades of unbroken growth , Australia 's economy is slowing -- crimped , not least , by the slowdown in its largest overseas market , China . Australia needs investment in services and new industries if it is to shift from an over - reliance on exporting iron ore and coal -- the hope is that consistent pro - business government will help that where Mr Abbott 's repeated U - turns hindered it . But the general election is due in less than a year . Malcolm Turnbull does not have long to prove that Malcolm Turnbull can lead an effective government . 
 Conviction politics 
 A natural question to ask is whether the economy can be fixed without also mending a political system that produces so many revolving - door prime ministers . Three - year parliamentary terms are extremely short and would seem an obvious culprit . Yet they used not to prevent strong leaders from emerging -- Mr Howard for one . 
 Certainly , subsequent leaders -- not least Mr Howard 's protege , Mr Abbott -- have been made of thinner stuff . But that is only part of the answer . The old class - bound lines , along which Liberal and Labor loyalties once ran , have gone . Both parties are now hunting on the same ground , among an urban , educated swing - voting middle class . When confronted by the findings of the latest opinion polls or focus groups , the parties ' tendency is to panic ; the next election is never far away . 
 This is not healthy . Australia should now debate lengthening the parliamentary term . And Malcolm Turnbull must prove that connecting with the middle ground -- which Mr Abbott abandoned -- is a better method of governing than jumping at every opinion poll . Australians may even reward Malcolm Turnbull for it .",900,Australia,cb-900-3,PRE TERM,True,Malcolm Turnbull,21,True

THE coup's speed stunned everyone. Australia's Liberal Party had always denounced its Labor opponents for ruthlessly tossing their leaders to the sharks as soon as they looked wobbly. Faced with such a threat himself on September 14th Tony Abbott, the then Liberal leader and prime minister, declared: ""We are not the Labor Party."" But within a matter of hours, his party had ditched its high-mindedness and replaced Mr Abbott with Malcolm Turnbull, a former ministerial colleague, as Australia's 29th prime minister. 
Mr Turnbull (pictured) is the fourth occupant of the post in just over two years, a record pace of political change at the top. The former Labor government had ousted Kevin Rudd in 2010 in favour of Julia Gillard, whom Mr Rudd ejected in 2013, only for Australians to elect a conservative Liberal-National coalition under Mr Abbott shortly after. Mr Rudd and Mr Abbott had in common that both led their parties to victory from opposition. Yet that counted for little once opinion polls turned against them, and their colleagues feared being sent back into opposition. 
Australia's leadership convulsions reflect a country in which class identities and political allegiances have become more fluid than ever. No longer assured of support from their old conservative and working-class bases respectively, Liberal and Labor must battle for a shifting middle ground: educated, urban professionals whose votes are up for grabs. Norman Abjorensen of the Australian National University reckons that these ""fluctuations in public opinion and the constant soundings of focus groups"" can doom leaders such as Mr Abbott if they falter. Their fates depend not on the previous election, but on their prospects for the next one. 
Revolving-door prime ministers 
Under Mr Abbott's leadership, the coalition had trailed Labor in opinion polls for more than a year. A poll in early September put Labor eight points ahead, a margin wide enough to crush the government at an election due in just a year. Mr Abbott blamed what he called the changing nature of Australia's politics after his Liberal colleagues overthrew him for Mr Turnbull by 54 votes to 44. ""We have more polls and more commentary than ever before,"" he said. ""Poll-driven panic has produced a revolving-door prime ministership, which can't be good for our country."" 
But that is to ignore the part Mr Abbott's own misjudgments played in his downfall. His politics proved mean-spirited, and he was readier to alarm Australians about security--for instance the threat of militant Islam in their midst--than to develop an inspired economic agenda. 
Growth has slowed to 2%, lower than earlier forecasts and well below Australia's potential. An investment boom in mining, linked to demand from China, Australia's biggest trading partner, has waned. Investment in services, high-end manufacturing and other non-mining ventures must take up the slack. Yet Canberra's political turmoil in recent years, as well Mr Abbott's policy U-turns and gaffes, have sapped business confidence. Voters' trust in the Abbott government never recovered after its first budget in 2014, in which savage spending cuts seemed to fall most heavily on those who could least afford them. Mr Turnbull was scathing, saying Mr Abbott had proved incapable of ""providing the economic confidence that business needs"". 
The new leader, who is 60, had long hankered after the job. Like Mr Abbott, Mr Turnbull comes from a comfortable background in Sydney. He holds socially liberal views, at odds with those of his party's reactionary wing. When Mr Turnbull led the Liberal Party before, during their opposition years, the right wing unseated him in 2009 and installed Mr Abbott, by one vote. As Mr Abbott's fortunes sank, Mr Turnbull seized the chance to reclaim the leadership and persuaded enough of Mr Abbott's supporters to switch sides, if only to save their own seats. 
A recent survey suggested that 41% of Australians wanted Mr Turnbull as Liberal leader, with just 15% preferring Mr Abbott. Mr Turnbull's unflinching character strikes a chord with many. His father raised him after his mother, a writer and academic, left for America when he was a child. In the late 1970s Mr Turnbull was a Rhodes scholar at Oxford, where a don wrote of him that he was ""always going to enter life's rooms without knocking"". Back in Australia he made his name as a lawyer and a fortune as a banker and IT entrepreneur. 
Mr Turnbull earned a reputation for fighting for progressive causes long before he entered parliament 11 years ago. As a lawyer in the late 1980s he successfully challenged a bid by the British government to stop the publication in Australia of a memoir by Peter Wright, a former British intelligence agent. In 1999 Mr Turnbull led the Australian Republican Movement's campaign at a referendum on ditching Australia's ties to the British monarchy. After John Howard, then Liberal prime minister, successfully pushed for a no vote, Mr Turnbull called him ""the prime minister who broke this nation's heart"". 
Now that Mr Turnbull has seized the prime ministership, he must unite his party's conservative and liberal wings. He will not for now try to push the party into enacting two changes he supports: allowing gay marriage and creating a market mechanism to tackle climate change. His main priority is to revive an economy that is running out of puff. 
His first test comes with a by-election on September 19th in Canning, a federal constituency near Perth in the state of Western Australia. A Liberal parliamentarian, whose death precipitated the election, had held the seat with a 12-point margin. Until Mr Turnbull's coup, the election threatened to turn into a rebuke of Mr Abbott. The seat is home to many workers who fly in and out of the mining regions that--until a recent slump in Chinese demand for commodities (see next story)--have helped to underwrite the country's prosperity. The Labor opposition leader, Bill Shorten, played on jitters among Canning's voters about the potential impact of a free-trade agreement that Australia signed in June with China. He claims it could favour workers from China over Australians in big Chinese projects in the country. Mr Turnbull attacked Mr Shorten's ""catastrophically reckless approach"", while describing the deal as ""one of the most important foundations of our prosperity"". He predicted that a change of Liberal leadership ""would improve our prospects in Canning"". 
Mr Turnbull's business background and reforming instincts endear him to business leaders. In his first day in Parliament as prime minister, Mr Turnbull offered a narrative far removed from that of his predecessor. ""These are most exciting times to be an Australian,"" he declared, while calling on the country to be ambitious in seizing economic opportunities. As China slows and drags down demand for the things Australia sells, Mr Turnbull's challenge will be to create a climate of greater certainty for business and investment--and optimism for voters. Joe Hockey seems unlikely to survive as Treasurer. 
Already Labor senses that it faces a more formidable fight at the next election. Yet Mr Turnbull knows as well as any how quickly the ground under Australia's politicians can shift.","Yet another prime minister is removed , and Malcolm Turnbull , promises happiness

THE bare expanse of Anna Creek cattle station (as Australians call ranches) belies its strategic attraction to investors. Straddling the river plains of the state of South Australia, and reputed to be the world's biggest cattle ranch by area, Anna Creek belongs to an empire of ten stations that Sidney Kidman, the ""cattle king"", started in 1899 (see map). Now, 116 years later, his descendants have put their inheritance on the market. The sale of S. Kidman & Co, due by the end of the year, has touched raw nerves over foreign investment, as Chinese and other overseas contenders circle a company that many Australians associate with their frontier heritage. 
The interest of would-be buyers is understandable. The Kidman herd of almost 200,000 cattle sprawls across a swathe of the outback about three-quarters the size of England, making it Australia's biggest private landholding. Australia is the world's biggest beef exporter after India and Brazil. Rising demand from China and elsewhere in Asia, as Australia's currency falls in value, has helped business boom. Kidman could sell for around A$325m ($228m). 
About half the 12 shortlisted bidders, whose identities have not been revealed, are foreign. Many may be Chinese. Doug Ferguson, a China expert at KPMG, a consulting firm, reckons that about 15 Chinese companies, some government-linked, would be capable of bidding for Kidman. 
Australians are becoming more used to Chinese investment. Four years ago, China ranked ninth by stock of foreign direct investment (America, Britain and Japan, three of Australia's oldest trading partners, top the list). Now Australia's biggest trading partner, China's inward investment has taken off: by 2014 it had moved up to fifth place. Australia's Foreign Investment Review Board (FIRB) says China has become a bigger investor by value than any country, measured by its share of the A$170 billion of proposed investments it examined last year. In the 2013-14 fiscal year, property worth A$12 billion represented China's biggest investment in Australia. 
Agricultural investments of all kinds, however, were just a fraction of that year's inflow: a mere A$32m. Chinese deals to buy farmland have been few and far between. Two years ago Shandong Ruyi, a Chinese textile company, bought most of Australia's biggest cotton farm, Cubbie Station in the state of Queensland. Tianma Bearing Group, another Chinese company, recently paid a reported A$47 million for Wollogorang and Wentworth, two cattle stations in the Northern Territory, where part of the Kidman empire is also located. Now the prospect of Kidman falling into Chinese hands has given extra piquancy to broader Australian anxieties about ""selling the farm"" to foreigners. 
Such anxieties are nothing new. When Tony Abbott, the recently-ejected prime minister, led the conservative Liberal-National coalition to government in 2013, he declared that Australia was ""open for business"". But a few weeks later Joe Hockey, then the treasurer, rejected a bid by Archer Daniels Midland (ADM), an American food-commodities giant, to take over GrainCorp, an Australian counterpart. Mr Hockey said foreign acquisition of ""this key Australian business"" would be against the national interest. He was bowing to pressure from the rural-based National Party, the coalition's junior partner. Similar pressures could come into play over the Kidman sale. The agriculture minister, Barnaby Joyce, who is from the National Party, opposes a ""foreign state-owned enterprise"" taking over Kidman. 
The ranch operator's sale could now be the first big test of Malcolm Turnbull, who deposed Mr Abbott as Liberal leader and prime minister on September 14th. Mr Turnbull is more of a free-market champion than his predecessor. He acknowledges Australia's ""long history of ambivalence to foreign investment"". But he identifies the country's key dilemma: ""resource-rich but capital-poor"". As soon as he took over as prime minister, there was speculation that ADM might make a fresh bid for full ownership of GrainCorp, of which it is already the largest shareholder. 
However, Mr Turnbull is bound by tighter foreign-investment rules that the government introduced under Mr Abbott. They require the FIRB to scrutinise all sales to foreign entities of rural land worth A$15m or more--the limit was previously A$252 million. The new rules will apply to bidders from China, Japan and South Korea, with which Australia recently signed free-trade agreements. But bidders from places like America, New Zealand and Chile, whose free-trade deals pre-dated the changes, can buy land worth more than A$1 billion before they are screened. 
Similar screening discrepancies will apply to bids for agri-businesses other than farms and ranches, such as GrainCorp. Critics charge that such a two-tier approach barely masks a quest to make life harder for investors from Asia. Peter Drysdale, an economist at the Australian National University, says it ""does not make any policy sense"". The FIRB only advises the government on foreign takeovers, but the very fact that a particular deal has fallen under the board's purview risks making it a political hot potato. 
Soaring house prices in Sydney and Melbourne, Australia's two biggest cities, have added to politicians' nervousness about foreign money coming into the country. Without presenting evidence, some press pundits and radio ""shock jocks"" have blamed Chinese investors for forcing Australians out of the market. But non-resident foreign investors are banned from buying houses in Australia. New dwellings are excepted on the ground that such sales help expand the housing stock. 
Some worry that the government risks scaring off foreign investors just when the country needs capital as its economy cools. Fears about foreign takeovers are exaggerated anyway. Australians still entirely own almost 99% of the country's farm businesses, and 90% of its agricultural land. Yet competition can only grow. Mr Ferguson reckons China's pursuit of food security will see a ""bigger shift"" in Chinese offshore farm investment. ""The Chinese have constantly declared they're looking for very large-scale properties,"" he says. ""Kidman is a classic example.""","The prospect of foreign ownership of two giant agri - businesses causes alarm

THE burial was swift. On November 2nd Malcolm Turnbull, Australia's prime minister, announced his government had removed the titles of knight and dame from among the honours that the country bestows. Tony Abbott, his predecessor, had resurrected them--40 years after they had been consigned to history as a quaint relic of Australia's British colonial past. In their latest life, they lasted just 20 months. 
Mr Turnbull unseated Mr Abbott as leader of the conservative Liberal Party, and prime minister, in mid-September, before Mr Abbott had served even a full term. The former prime minister's fondness for British-style gongs played a big part in his downfall. He astonished Australians when he revived them early last year, without consulting his cabinet. In January, on Australia's national holiday, he awarded a knighthood to Prince Philip (pictured), the husband of Australia's head of state, the British queen. The press ridiculed the award as ""Abbott's knightmare"", and accused him of being completely out of touch with Australia's egalitarian ethos. 
Unlike Mr Abbott, Mr Turnbull is a republican (he is also less impulsive: he discussed his plan with the cabinet first). He called the titles ""really anachronistic"" and ""not appropriate"" for Australia. Prince Philip and four other of Mr Abbott's knights and dames, will keep their honours. But the timing of Mr Turnbull's announcement hinted at a disregard for the monarchy. Prince Charles, Prince Philip's son who is next in line as Australia's head of state, is due to visit the country on November 10th with his wife, the Duchess of Cornwall. 
Tim Mayfield, who heads a republican group once led by Mr Turnbull, reckons support for a monarch-free Australia is higher now than it was 16 years ago when 45% of Australians voted in a referendum against keeping the tie with Britain (John Howard, then prime minister, and Mr Abbott's chief mentor, campaigned for the monarchy, ensuring the republicans' defeat.) Mr Mayfield may well be right. Apart from a handful of diehard monarchists, politicians across the spectrum and the media have welcomed Mr Turnbull's move to scrap the awards. 
He has been enjoying a political honeymoon generally. Opinion polls suggest that his steering of the Liberal Party towards the political centre is popular among voters. With a general election due in about a year, Mr Turnbull's conservative enemies within his own party have fallen unusually silent.

But the timing of Malcolm Turnbull's announcement hinted at a disregard for the monarchy . Prince Charles , Prince Philip 's son who is next in line as Australia 's head of state , is due to visit the country on November 10th with his wife , the Duchess of Cornwall . 
 Tim Mayfield , who heads a republican group once led by Malcolm Turnbull , reckons support for a monarch - free Australia is higher now than it was 16 years ago when 45 % of Australians voted in a referendum against keeping the tie with Britain ( John Howard , then prime minister , and Mr Abbott 's chief mentor , campaigned for the monarchy , ensuring the republicans ' defeat . ) Mr Mayfield may well be right . Apart from a handful of diehard monarchists , politicians across the spectrum and the media have welcomed Malcolm Turnbull's move to scrap the awards . 
 Malcolm Turnbull has been enjoying a political honeymoon generally . Opinion polls suggest that Malcolm Turnbull's steering of the Liberal Party towards the political centre is popular among voters . With a general election due in about a year , Malcolm Turnbull's conservative enemies within Malcolm Turnbull's own party have fallen unusually silent .

The group's barbarity was unrelenting. Gruesome propaganda included the burning alive in a cage of a Jordanian pilot whom IS had captured, the beheading of 21 Egyptian Coptic Christians in Libya and the murder of the 82-year-old head of antiquities at Palmyra, a heritage site in Syria that was looted by IS. 
Western governments felt compelled to counter the threat, especially after IS claimed responsibility for an assault on Paris in which gunmen mowed down people in restaurants and bars and at a rock concert, killing 130 and injuring hundreds. President Francois Hollande declared that France was at war with IS. 
After claiming that a Russian airliner had been bombed by IS affiliates in Egypt, Russia sent fighter jets to Syria, ostensibly to bomb IS. Most of its firepower, however, was directed at other opponents of the Syrian despot, Bashar al-Assad, a client of Vladimir Putin. In California 14 people were killed by a married couple inspired by IS. In December Barack Obama claimed that the American-led coalition was hitting IS hard, curtailing its operations in Iraq and Syria. 
Turkey alsoentered the fray, after a student gathering was bombed in a town near the Syrian border. But Turkey also targeted the Kurdish PKK. Suicide-bombers in Ankara attacked a peace rally that called for an end to Turkey's actions against the Kurds, killing 102 people. The chaos only strengthened the hand of the ruling Justice and Development party, which won an election in November. 
Je suis Charlie 
Other atrocities committed by jihadists included the killing of 148 people at Garissa University in Kenya, which the Shabab in next-door Somalia said it had carried out. A lone gunman slaughtered 38 tourists, most British, on a beach in Tunisia; three months earlier 22 people were killed at a museum in Tunis. In early January gunmen stormed the offices of Charlie Hebdo in Paris, killing 12. That attack prompted millions to protest worldwide in defence of free speech. But in some Muslim countries mass rallies were held denouncing the magazine for publishing cartoons of Muhammad the Prophet. 
Around half of the hundreds of thousands of people who streamed into Europe in the continent's worst refugee crisis since the Balkan wars came from Syria. The image of a three-year-old Syrian boy found drowned on a Turkish beach caused widespread outrage. Several summits were held to try to resolve the crisis. Germany threw open its borders and is on course to accept more than 1m asylum-seekers this year. 
China's stockmarkets plunged during the summer, sending out global ripples. China's ham-fisted attempts to stop the sell-off, such as directing large state investors (""the national team"") to buy shares, did nothing to calm nerves. Nor did a sudden devaluation of the yuan. The whole episode raised perturbing questions about the state of China's slowing economy and the competence of its regulators. 
The total value of announced takeovers in 2015 passed $4.3 trillion, breaking a record set in 2007. Pfizer's $160 billion purchase of Allergan, Dow Chemical's $130 billion merger with DuPont and Anheuser-Busch InBev's $110 billion acquisition of SAB Miller were three of the biggest in history. Other deals included Shell/BG Group ($70 billion), Charter Communications/Time Warner Cable ($55 billion), Anthem/Cigna ($52 billion) and Heinz/Kraft ($50 billion). 
The tech industry passed several milestones. Dell's $67 billion takeover of EMC was the biggest to date. Facebook set a new record when one billion people logged onto the social network in a single day. But there were fears that the heady valuations of many private tech startups, also known as ""unicorns"", might turn out to be another bubble. 
It was a dismal year for Volkswagen. A boardroom spat at the German carmaker led to the resignation of Ferdinand Piech as chairman. VW was then embroiled in crisis in the autumn after admitting it had installed software on diesel cars that cheated emissions tests in America. 
The president of everybody 
VW's wrongdoing came to light because of an American investigation. America also brought another institution based in Europe to task when it laid corruption charges against several officials at FIFA, football's world governing body. Football fans cheered when Sepp Blatter at last stepped down as FIFA's president. 
A UN summit on climate change, held in Paris, produced an agreement that aims to hold the increase in the global average temperature to ""well below 2[degrees]C above pre-industrial levels"", a more ambitious goal than had been expected. It marked an unprecedented political recognition of the risks of global warming, though some greens were sceptical that governments would follow through. 
Gay marriage took two giant steps forward. It became legal everywhere in America when the Supreme Court ruled that the constitution grants an ""equal dignity"" to gay couples. And Ireland became the first country to approve gay marriage by a popular vote. 
Two big elections in Latin America suggested that the continent's ""pink tide"" was turning. In Argentina Mauricio Macri was elected president, beating the candidate favoured by the departing Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner and bringing an end to 12 years of populist rule by the Kirchner family. In Venezuela, voters fed up with years of economic mismanagement rejected the party of President Nicolas Maduro in a parliamentary election. 
A career-defining election 
Britain's general election confounded the pollsters when the Conservative Party, which had governed in coalition with the Liberal Democrats for five years, secured its first overall majority in Parliament since 1992. The Lib Dems were reduced to a handful of MPs, whereas nationalists won all but three seats in Scotland. The opposition Labour Party went into self-destruct mode after the election by choosing Jeremy Corbyn, a leftist, as its new leader. 
The polls also got it wrong in Canada, where the Conservative Party was chucked out of office and a new Liberal government, headed by Justin Trudeau, was voted in. In Israel Binyamin Netanyahu wrong-footed the pundits when he was returned to power as prime minister. The Law and Justice Party, a group of xenophobic populists and conspiracy theorists, won two elections in Poland. 
Nigeria elected a new president, Muhammadu Buhari, who defeated an incompetent incumbent, Goodluck Jonathan. Malcolm Turnbull became Australia's fourth prime minister in five years, when Tony Abbott was ousted by his Liberal Party. 
An election in January brought the far-left Syriza party to power in Greece. It went on to win a referendum in July that rejected austerity imposed by the IMF and EU. But with markets jittery, and trading on the Athens stock exchange suspended for five weeks, Alexis Tsipras, the prime minister, was eventually forced to agree to another bail-out, much to the disgust of his more radical colleagues. Weary Greeks trudged to the polls for a third time in September and re-elected Mr Tsipras. With the euro zone still in the doldrums, the European Central Bank introduced a huge quantitative-easing programme in January. 
After years of talks, Iran and six world powers reached a deal on Iran's nuclear programme. Some hailed it as a chance for Iran to come out of the cold. Others, notably Israel, said the deal was a mistake that would allow Iran to develop nuclear weapons and throw its weight around. 
Dilma Rousseff had a terrible start to her second term as Brazil's president. A corruption scandal involving Petrobras, a state-controlled oil firm, ensnared members of her Workers' Party. The opposition threatened to impeach her because of allegedly illegal funding arrangements for the government. The economy shrank by 4.5% in the third quarter. 
Russia's economy stumbled. The IMF expects Russian GDP to contract by 3.8% this year and 0.6% in 2016. The country has been hammered by falling oil prices. Brent crude started the year trading at just under $60 a barrel; it is now below $38. Russia has also been hurt by sanctions in response to its military meddling in eastern Ukraine, though the fighting eased after a ceasefire was signed in February. 
Nepal was struck by an earthquake of magnitude 7.8 in April, the worst in the Himalayan country in 80 years. The death toll of 9,000 was the highest from a natural disaster since the earthquake and tsunami that hit Japan in 2011. 
Myanmar held its first freely contested election since 1990. The National League for Democracy, headed by Aung San Suu Kyi, trounced the party of the ruling junta. Cuba and the United States restored full diplomatic relations, which had been put in the deep freeze during the cold war. Travel restrictions were eased. America hopes its engagement with the Castro regime will push the island towards democracy. 
He'd like to build a great wall 
America's presidential candidates started their campaigns. Hillary Clinton wobbled under pressure about her use of an insecure private server for official e-mail, but remains the Democratic front-runner. The Republican establishment was unpleasantly surprised when D onald Trump soared into the lead in the party's race, despite badmouthing women, Mexicans, Muslims, etc. The primaries start in February. Paul Ryan became (somewhat reluctantly) Speaker of the House following the defenestration of John Boehner. 
America suffered several mass shootings. In one, inCharleston, South Carolina, nine people at a black church were gunned down by a white supremacist. Elsewhere the police were berated for their excessive use of force. The worst riots in Baltimore since the 1960s were triggered by the death of a black man in police custody. 
The aviation industry introduced rules ensuring at least two crew members remain in the cockpit during a flight, after a suicidal co-pilot deliberately crashed a German airliner into the French Alps, killing all 150 people on board. 
After a nine-and-a-half-year wait, the New Horizons space probe whizzed past Pluto at 14km per second (31,000mph). It took remarkable pictures that are only now filtering back to Earth, such as the ice-covered al-Idrisi mountains. 
Social media roared with indignation when Cecil the Lion was killed in a Zimbabwean national park by a dentist from Minnesota. Although the dentist had a permit, close to 1.5m people have signed a petition calling for him to face justice without anaesthetic.","Islamic State extended its bloody reach far beyond its base in Iraq and Syria.

WHEN people call Australia ""The Lucky Country"", they often do not realise that Donald Horne, the writer who coined that phrase in a book of the same name in 1964, meant it as a criticism. ""Australia is a lucky country run mainly by second-rate people who share its luck,"" he wrote. ""It lives on other people's ideas..."" Horne intended the phrase as a warning to Australians, and a plea for more curiosity from its leaders. 
The country's good fortune has long rested on wealth from its mineral resources and farmland. Now, however, with the prices of the commodities it exports hitting rock-bottom, Australians are beginning to realise that more must be done to encourage the formation of innovative businesses. Instead of living on other people's ideas, in other words, it needs to generate its own. 
Among Australia's 2.6m registered businesses, the survival rate compares well with America's and Canada's, and is better than New Zealand's. But a study published last month by the government's Productivity Commission found that few young Australians start their own firms; that only about 0.5% of newly formed businesses are startups as commonly understood (innovative, ambitious and with high growth potential); and that only 1-2% of existing businesses can be described as innovating. This puts Australia on a par with Canada, say, but behind America and Britain. The commission concluded that one reason why Australia lags is that entrepreneurs need ""other entrepreneurs nearby to connect and work with."" 
Fortunately, Australia now has both a shining example of a tech startup becoming a global success, and a former tech entrepreneur as prime minister. Atlassian, a software firm whose products are used by developers and project managers, listed on the NASDAQ exchange in America last month, making its founders, Scott Farquhar and Mike Cannon-Brookes, Australia's first tech billionaires. And in September Malcolm Turnbull, a lawyer and investor turned politician, unseated Tony Abbott as prime minister and leader of the Liberal Party. In the 1990s Mr Turnbull had made a fortune investing in OzEmail, an Australian internet-service provider. 
Atlassian's blunt slogan befits its Australian roots: ""Open company, no bullshit"". Though it has offices in San Francisco, its headquarters remain in Sydney. Its founders, two university friends, started it in 2002 with a A$10,000 (then $5,400) credit-card loan. Fourteen years later, Atlassian's customers include NASA, Netflix and Facebook and the company is valued at $5.6 billion. ""When we began, there was no startup culture in Australia to follow,"" says Mr Farquhar. ""The attitude, fear of failure, was a problem."" Some say it still is. 
Three days before Atlassian's listing, Mr Turnbull gave a speech that Australian business leaders hailed as a welcome change in official attitudes to promoting innovation. Mr Abbott had cut a backward-looking figure, stopping public funding for wind energy and describing coal as ""good for humanity"". Mr Turnbull called for an ""ideas boom"" to replace mining booms as the country's new growth source, and told Australians they were falling behind most other rich countries in turning their ideas into commercial ventures. He promised about A$1 billion ($720m) in incentives, including tax breaks for investors in startups and venture-capital partnerships. 
Mr Turnbull's pitch to brand himself as the leader of the future, and to get his compatriots to rethink their ""Lucky Country"" attitudes, may take more than tax breaks. To begin to create the sort of community of entrepreneurs and innovators the Productivity Commission called for, Atlassian tried to buy a 19th-century former railway workshop near Sydney's business district. In November, however, the New South Wales state government sold the site instead to a consortium led by Mirvac, a property company. 
Mirvac plans to use much of the site for new offices for the Commonwealth Bank, though it will convert a former locomotive shed into spaces for tech firms and other startups. Even so, Mr Farquhar laments the sale as a lost opportunity to build a larger tech ecosystem that could help spawn more companies like his. Australia, he says, must decide if it wants to be a software producer for the world or a consumer, ""missing this whole revolution and left wondering how we are going to pay for it"". 
Mr Turnbull is putting his faith in a strengthening of links between science and business. He has restored a A$111m budget cut that Mr Abbott made to the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO), Australia's chief science agency, the outfit that invented the technology behind Wi-Fi. 
Larry Marshall, the CSIRO's head, was struck by Australia's somewhat timid approach to business risk when he returned to his home country in 2015 after working as an entrepreneur for 26 years in Silicon Valley. He suggests would-be tech pioneers could find a model in Australia's ""incredibly risk-tolerant"" frontier economy. Facing enormous distances and tough terrain, miners and farmers have survived only by innovating. The CSIRO has, for instance, collaborated with BHP Billiton, Newcrest Mining and others on better ways to drill ores, detect their grades and raise productivity. Cotton farmers now mainly use varieties the CSIRO has developed, which need less water and pesticides to deliver high yields. The challenge, Mr Marshall argues, is to channel the old economy's risk-taking into new industries in which Australia has a good chance to excel: high-value food and biotechnology. 
Some are already following in Atlassian's wake. Alec Lynch and Adam Arbolino launched DesignCrowd in Sydney eight years ago after an earlier startup failed. Undeterred, Mr Lynch saw a chance to change the ""slow, risky and expensive"" way people procure projects from local graphic designers. DesignCrowd lets customers set budgets and receive ideas from designers around the world. After self-funding at first, capital came in from local angel investors and Starfish Ventures, a Melbourne venture-capital firm. DesignCrowd now has revenues of almost A$20m a year, four-fifths from outside Australia, and has opened offices in San Francisco and Manila. 
Mr Lynch foresees a ""mini startup boom"" emerging in Australia. And he is optimistic that the interventions of the tech-friendly prime minister can only help Australia go from being the Lucky Country to one that makes its own luck.","An entrepreneurial prime minister calls for a culture of innovation

RIGHT after Malcolm Turnbull defenestrated his Liberal Party boss last September, Australia's new leader, the fourth prime minister in three years, promised ""substantial change"" and a ""different style of leadership"" to that of Tony Abbott, his ousted predecessor. In place of the division and dysfunction of Mr Abbott's time as prime minister, Mr Turnbull would be a unifying force, promoting sound policy while dragging politics back to the centre ground. After Mr Abbott's rightist demagoguery, Mr Turnbull would lead through ""advocacy, not slogans"". 
Australians cheered, and the approval ratings of the government that the (conservative) Liberals lead in coalition with the smaller National Party leapt. Mr Turnbull talked of a new dawn. Yet until recently the sun has shone upon the not much new. Mr Turnbull has struggled to assert his authority and carry out his promises. 
One problem lies in the Senate, where eight senators representing tiny parties, including the Australian Motoring Enthusiast Party (mission: to safeguard people's right ""to modify and restore vehicles based upon their own freedom of expression""), hold the balance of power. Another is that the Liberal Party's rifts remained unhealed, with Mr Abbott and allies continuing to snipe from the backbenches. 
Mr Turnbull, a former investment banker and businessman, has made a few policy strokes. For instance, he wants legislation to curb anti-competitive business conduct, calling it a ""long overdue reform"", a pointed swipe at Mr Abbott, who avoided the issue. But his promised plans to reform taxes remain confused. At first, his government signalled raising the goods and services (consumption) tax from its present rate of 10%, and lowering income taxes. It then seemed to drop both ideas. Mr Turnbull now says his tax plans will be revealed in the government's forthcoming budget. 
Meanwhile, despite being a social liberal, he has pulled his punches on issues he had hitherto promoted, including gay marriage, which two-thirds of Australians support. Mr Turnbull favoured a simple parliamentary vote on same-sex unions. But now he has stuck to Mr Abbott's proposal of a plebiscite to gauge public opinion, and to hold it after the next election. One estimate puts the cost at A$525m ($399m). 
He is paying the price for apparent drift. An opinion poll on March 21st gave the government just a two-point lead over the opposition Labor Party. As for Mr Turnbull's own approval as prime minister, it has sunk to 39%, from 60% in November. His lead as preferred prime minister over the leader of the Labor Party, Bill Shorten, has also narrowed. 
Yet in the past few days Mr Turnbull has embarked on a series of canny steps designed to break the Senate logjam, set his stamp on his own party and keep the opposition off balance. On March 18th he won approval from Parliament to simplify the convoluted system of proportional representation under which Australians elect the Senate. The power of independents and so-called micro-parties has grown. They have learnt to use vote-swapping deals at elections to increase their numbers in the Senate. There they have blocked government legislation they dislike. But now the prime minister has won support from the Australian Greens, with ten senators, to push through changes that a parliamentary committee recommended two years ago. Rather than being bound in Senate elections by second-preference votes that parties allocate, voters will now be free to specify their own order of voting. 
Mr Turnbull called that and related changes a ""great day for democracy"", by which he really meant for the bigger parties, since smaller ones will struggle in future to muster enough votes to qualify for a Senate seat. Two micro-party senators have launched a High Court appeal against the changes, but Mr Turnbull sounds confident that it will fail. 
Now to the polls 
Soon after Parliament voted on the Senate changes, it adjourned. It was due to return for the government to present its budget on May 10th, ahead of an election that was widely expected for September. Yet Mr Turnbull's next move, on March 21st, suggested that the campaign has begun already. The prime minister called a press conference to declare that he would recall Parliament three weeks early, in order, he said, to consider legislation to police the building industry and the unions that play a powerful part in it. (The industry harbours two-thirds of Australia's industrial disputes.) He wants to re-establish the Australian Building and Construction Commission that the previous Labor government abolished. Last year in the Senate, Labor, the Australian Greens and independents defeated a move by the Abbott government to bring the commission back. A second Senate defeat would give Mr Turnbull a constitutional trigger for a rare ""double dissolution"" of both houses of Parliament and an election, on July 2nd. 
The timing of Mr Turnbull's move took nearly everyone by surprise, as did his September coup against Mr Abbott. In the House of Representatives, Mr Shorten declared that it was a mark of a government in ""full panic mode"". But the prime minister will claim the high ground by accusing Labor of being beholden to unions. As for the Senate, the new voting rules give him a better chance than before of winning control of the chamber. 
Still, it all remains a gamble for Mr Turnbull. The unresolved divisions in his party are just one symptom of what Stephen Loosley, a former Labor senator, decries as the ""indulgent politics"" of both sides. And should the Senate reforms work his way, then, for the second time, Mr Turnbull will need to convince Australians that he is the one to change the political culture.","Malcolm Turnbull threatens an early election in a bid to stamp Malcolm Turnbull's authority

Peace talks on Syria were hanging by a thread after the opposition said it was demanding a pause (not quite, as yet, a walk-out) after an intensification of attacks by the regime of Bashar al-Assad in apparent violation of a month-old ceasefire. At least 50 people are thought to have been killed this week.

IT WAS a poignant moment in mid-April when a Japanese Soryu-class submarine sailed into Sydney harbour--the first visit by a Japanese undersea vessel since three of the country's midget submarines raided the harbour and killed 21 allied sailors during the second world war. This time, Japan had a different aim: it was vying with France and Germany to win a bid to build a new fleet of submarines for Australia. So when Malcolm Turnbull, the prime minister, announced on April 26th that the A$50 billion ($38 billion) contract had gone to France, Japan took it to heart. The decision, it said, was ""deeply regrettable"". It demanded an explanation. 
Intense speculation had surrounded the competition between the three countries for the biggest single weapons-buying deal in Australian history. It will double the size of the country's submarine fleet to 12. Some observers had taken note of politics in Australia. An election is looming, probably in July. Mr Turnbull says the subs will be built in South Australia, where support for his coalition government has been waning. Lay-offs in the car-making industry, and a downturn in the steel industry, have hit the state hard. Building the subs there, even at a higher cost than doing so abroad, could create almost 3,000 jobs. 
But the strategic aspects of the bid had aroused greater interest than the ramifications for Australian politics. Japan's hopes had soared under Tony Abbott, whom Mr Turnbull ousted as Liberal leader and prime minister seven months ago. Mr Abbott had cosied up to Shinzo Abe, Japan's prime minister. He had called Japan Australia's ""best friend in Asia"" and said he hoped it would become a ""more capable strategic partner"". Japan had got the impression that its bid was almost in the bag. 
Since taking over, Mr Turnbull has gone out of his way to strike more of a balance in his country's relationships with Japan and China, Australia's biggest trading partner. During a visit to China in mid-April, Mr Turnbull spoke of China's ""extraordinary opportunities"". He has tried to dampen speculation that Australia might form a closer military partnership with Japan and America as a hedge against China's rise. 
Australia insists that grand strategy had nothing to do with its decision on the subs. DCNS, the state-owned French naval shipbuilding firm that won the contract, will build a modified version of Shortfin Barracuda-class subs to replace Australia's ageing Collins-class fleet. Mr Turnbull says DCNS is the ""most suitable international partner"" for building subs to meet Australia's ""unique national-security requirements"". This means subs that can travel greater distances in the surrounding Indian and Pacific oceans. 
Australia's latest defence white paper, released in February, says that half the world's submarines will be operating in the two oceans within 20 years; it says a ""more challenging maritime environment"" justifies the doubling of Australia's undersea fleet. Military planners do not like to say so openly, but they are worried that China's territorial ambitions in the South China Sea may become a cause of conflict that may affect Australia. 
It is likely that Japan lost out because it could not match France's experience in making warships on such a scale for export. Had Japan won, it would have been the country's first big arms-exporting deal since it passed legislation two years ago ending a long-standing ban on selling weapons abroad. The white paper said Australia needed submarines with a ""high degree of interoperability with the United States"". Japan could have provided that, but there would have been technical challenges. It would have had to build boats with greater power than the subs it uses, to enable them to travel longer distances. (And the cabins would have had to be adapted for mixed-gender crews.) 
Rory Medcalf of Australian National University says Japan should swallow its pride. The purchase of the French-built subs, he argues, will help make Australia the kind of security partner Japan wants in order to deter an assertive China. Even Mr Turnbull, the balancer, says the ""special strategic partnership"" between Japan and Australia will get ""stronger all the time"". Japan, however, will lick its wounds a while longer.","Australia spends big on new submarines , upsetting Japan

That is more than nine times the minimum needed to begin the next stage of the process, the collection of a further 4m signatures.

HOURS after his treasurer, or finance minister, unveiled the annual budget, Malcolm Turnbull, Australia's prime minister, confirmed what for weeks had been an open secret: that he would call a general election for July 2nd. And so the budget laid out by Scott Morrison on May 3rd is less about the fiscal priorities for the coming year than it is the basis for Mr Turnbull's bid for a new political mandate. That is rather a lot to lay on any budget. But having failed to deliver the ""substantial change"" that he promised last September when knifing his predecessor, Tony Abbott, as leader of the (conservative) Liberal Party and prime minister, Mr Turnbull has mainly himself to blame. 
Gone is Mr Abbott's rhetoric about fixing the previous Labor government's ""debt and deficit disaster"". Instead Mr Morrison called his document ""not just another budget"", more an ""economic plan"". The budget deficit of A$40 billion ($30 billion), or 2% of GDP, will fall only slightly next year, to be followed by deficits until at least 2020. Abandoning its pledge to produce surpluses, Mr Morrison now merely says that the budget will be balanced ""over time"". 
This is candid, at least. Sustained by trade with China, Australia is entering its 26th year of continuous economic growth. The government's forecast for growth in 2016-17 is a respectable 2.5%. But that forecast was pared back; and a sharp slowdown in Chinese demand, along with falls in the prices of iron ore, coal and gas, Australia's chief exports, mean that the resource sector's fabulous profits from the boom in China are a thing of the past. It is probably right that there should be no rush to plug the deficit. For one thing, net government debt, at 19% of GDP, is remarkably low. And now signs of softness are appearing in parts of the economy. In a surprise move hours before the budget, the central bank cut interest rates by a quarter of a percentage point, to 1.75%, citing ""unexpectedly low"" inflation. It may well move again. 
Natural resources were responsible not only for much of Australia's growth in recent years, but also for much government revenue. Mineral exports will remain important: thanks in part to heavy investment, Australian resource firms are among the lowest-cost producers. But their extra capacity and output has played a part in pushing down commodities prices worldwide. So the country needs to find new sources of growth. 
The budget partly reflects the mantra of Mr Turnbull, a self-made millionaire, that offering incentives to innovators is the key. The budget projects a cut in corporate taxation. From July the rate for small businesses with a turnover of less than A$10m will fall from 30% to 27.5%; after ten years the rate for all businesses, big and small, will be 25%. 
Australian businesses have long called for such cuts. Meanwhile, the second-highest rate of income tax was pushed out from those earning A$80,000 to A$87,000--helping some 500,000 Australians, the treasurer said. But many others may wonder what is in the budget for them. This is perhaps why Mr Morrison also espoused more popular causes, such as promising punitive taxation for multinational companies deemed to be using loopholes to divert profits to other jurisdictions and so avoid tax. He also promised more infrastructure spending, including a planned freight-rail link between Melbourne and Brisbane, so taking lorries off the roads. 
The budget rejected reform in an area that will feature in the campaign: housing. Low interest rates are not the only thing that has encouraged average house prices to nearly double over the past ten years. The crazy practice of ""negative gearing"", which allows investors in property to write nearly everything off against tax, has also helped push up prices beyond the reach of Australians in their 20s and 30s (many of whom, even if they are able to buy a property, still have to live with their parents to afford it). Yet Mr Turnbull calls the idea of repealing negative gearing ""reckless"", knowing that it would anger property-owners--and possibly alarm banks, heavily exposed to mortgages. 
The Labor opposition wants to end most forms of negative gearing. More broadly, Bill Shorten, the Labor leader, intends to campaign on a theme that Mr Turnbull is merely a smoother version of the abrasive Mr Abbott, but just as unfair. Meanwhile, his shadow treasurer, Chris Bowen, says he intends to prove to Australians that left-leaning Labor is also the party of fiscal probity. 
Mr Turnbull's campaign hinges on how cleverly he can counteract this. Australia's fourth prime minister in three years, he at first offered hope to a cynical electorate of ending the country's political shambles. Recent opinion polls place Labor ahead after second-preference votes. More voters still nominate Mr Turnbull over Mr Shorten as their preferred prime minister, and more still think the Liberal-National coalition, not Labor, will win the election. But it could be more closely fought than seemed likely a few months ago. The coalition holds a comfortable majority. Should it win with a much reduced one, then far from being the solution to Australia's troubled politics, Mr Turnbull could conceivably become part of the problem--and become as vulnerable to a knifing as Mr Abbott was nine months ago.","Malcolm Turnbull gambles that this week 's budget will win the election 
 HOURS after Malcolm Turnbull's treasurer , or finance minister , unveiled the annual budget , Malcolm Turnbull's , confirmed what for weeks had been an open secret : that Malcolm Turnbull would call a general election for July 2nd . And so the budget laid out by Scott Morrison on May 3rd is less about the fiscal priorities for the coming year than it is the basis for Malcolm Turnbull's bid for a new political mandate . That is rather a lot to lay on any budget . But having failed to deliver the "" substantial change "" that Malcolm Turnbull promised last September when knifing Malcolm Turnbull's predecessor , Tony Abbott , as leader of the ( conservative ) Liberal Party and prime minister , Malcolm Turnbull has mainly Malcolm Turnbull to blame . 
 Gone is Mr Abbott 's rhetoric about fixing the previous Labor government 's "" debt and deficit disaster "" . Instead Mr Morrison called his document "" not just another budget "" , more an "" economic plan "" . The budget deficit of A$ 40 billion ( $ 30 billion ) , or 2 % of GDP , will fall only slightly next year , to be followed by deficits until at least 2020 . Abandoning its pledge to produce surpluses , Mr Morrison now merely says that the budget will be balanced "" over time "" . 
 This is candid , at least . Sustained by trade with China , Australia is entering its 26th year of continuous economic growth . The government 's forecast for growth in 2016 - 17 is a respectable 2.5 % .

ELECTRICITY pylons on the long, barren highway leading north of Whyalla, an industrial city in the state of South Australia, are festooned with campaign posters. Australia is just weeks away from a general election: Malcolm Turnbull, the prime minister, is seeking a second term for his conservative Liberal-National coalition against a revived Labor Party, led by Bill Shorten. But most posters on the Whyalla highway depict neither of these major-party candidates. Instead, they show the grinning face of Nick Xenophon, an independent senator from Adelaide, the state capital, whose influence reaches far beyond his home state. 
By calling an election for July 2nd, Mr Turnbull hoped to strengthen his position with a solid mandate. Strong leaders are in short supply: in the past decade Australia has had three governments and five prime ministers. Mr Turnbull began the campaign with a hefty lead, but polls have tightened. And South Australia--abundant in red desert, farms and mines, but with just 8% of Australia's 24m people--has emerged as a fierce battleground. 
For more than a century iron ore has been dug out of the state's mountains. In recent years Chinese demand triggered a boom: when the financial crash eight years ago sent other countries into recession, South Australia kept building. Investors snapped up tidy little houses on the edge of the desert at Whyalla, then a boomtown. ""We didn't really feel the crisis here,"" says Peter Calliss, an estate agent. 
That has changed: today South Australia is weathering a nasty downturn. Collapsing ore prices and a global steel glut pushed Arrium, a large steelmaker in Whyalla, into administration in April. The state shed thousands of manufacturing jobs in the past decade; no state has a higher unemployment rate (6.9%). More will go when General Motors leaves Adelaide next year, bringing to an end 69 years of carmaking in Australia. 
Mr Turnbull has promised to stanch the flow of job losses. Australia will build 12 new submarines in Adelaide, which will employ around 3,000 people. At a campaign stop in June, he vowed to bring ""the jobs of the future"" to the state. But many locals still blame his predecessor for destroying the jobs of the present: Tony Abbott, whom Mr Turnbull unseated as Liberal leader last September, refused the car industry's pleas for more subsidies. The industry had long been uncompetitive, but to many South Australians it was part of their identity. 
Enter Mr Xenophon. He first won election to state parliament in 1997 on an anti-gambling platform. Since moving up to the federal parliament eight years ago, he has emerged as a popular national figure. His views are eclectic: suspicious of foreign investment, free trade and carbon taxes; but resolutely pro-immigration. This year, for the first time, he is fielding candidates for all of South Australia's lower house seats, and for the upper house in all six states. 
A recent poll gave the Nick Xenophon Team 22% of first votes in South Australia. That may be enough to snatch at least Mayo, a prized Liberal lower-house seat near Adelaide. Mr Xenophon's candidate there is Rebekha Sharkie, who once worked for the seat's Liberal member. 
She left the Liberals four years ago, amid what she saw as the party's rightward drift: ""They seemed to have forgotten middle Australia."" She was also dismayed by Mr Abbott's speaking under a ""Ditch the Witch"" sign aimed at Julia Gillard, then the prime minister. Ms Sharkie reckons her moderate politics will play well in South Australia. 
Polls show they may do so nationally, too. Mr Xenophon's team could win enough Senate seats to hold bargaining power with whichever major party wins the lower house. Liberal and Labor, old archenemies, are even discussing deals that could involve asking their supporters to cast their second votes tactically to thwart Mr Xenophon and the Australian Greens, another small party, under the lower house's preferential voting system. 
Mr Xenophon ascribes his rising popularity to a ""changing old order in politics"". He rails against free-trade agreements, blaming them for job losses and castigating Australia's ""lousy negotiators"". He wants the Trans-Pacific Partnership, a 12-nation trade pact that Australia has agreed to, but not yet ratified, ""taken off the table"". 
That is unlikely to happen. Still, his economic populism resonates in South Australia. Ian Walkden, who owns an office-supply business in Whyalla, predicts a swing towards Mr Xenophon's slate. ""Lost manufacturing is not just about Whyalla,"" he says. ""It's about South Australia and the whole of Australia.""

IN THEIR last debate before Australia's general election on July 2nd, Malcolm Turnbull, the Liberal prime minister and head of the conservative coalition government, and Bill Shorten, the Labor opposition leader, faced not just an audience of swing voters, but the entire world: Facebook live-streamed the event. An online viewer named Melissa asked the first question: given the ""lies and backflipping"" from major-party politicians, and the number of prime ministers Australia has churned through (five in the past decade), why should she vote for either of them? Why not vote for an independent? Many voters are asking themselves the same thing. More than any Australian election in decades, this one could be decided by independents and small parties. 
That is partly owing to surprisingly tight polls. The government's approval rating soared after Mr Turnbull unseated the snarling Tony Abbott as the Liberal Party's leader last September. With his sunnier manner and more liberal views, many expected Mr Turnbull to coast to an easy victory as he sought a strong mandate of his own. But Mr Shorten, the first Labor leader in 15 years to survive a full parliamentary term, has proved an unexpectedly deft campaigner: government and opposition are now tied. 
But it also shows how outmoded Australia's two-party system has grown. The class divisions that produced the Labor-Liberal divide have faded. Australia has grown more diverse and some of its concerns--climate change, immigration, China's rise--more complex. Many voters have turned, in hope or protest, to outsider candidates, who now garner 28% support, according to the most recent polls. Among these the Australian Greens, an environmental party, and the Nick Xenophon Team, a new centrist party headed by Mr Xenophon, an independent senator from South Australia, are forecast to win seats in both houses of parliament. 
Tony Windsor, also an independent, is challenging Barnaby Joyce, the deputy prime minister and leader of the rural National Party, for the New South Wales seat of New England. Their race shows Australia's shifting electoral dynamics. Some rural conservatives never forgave Mr Windsor for helping Julia Gillard, a former Labor leader, form a minority government six years ago. But an unlikely alliance of farmers and environmentalists support him. Mr Windsor contends that Mr Turnbull's government has harmed rural Australians by changing Labor's plans for a national cable-broadband network. And he accuses both major parties of ignoring the environmental risks posed by a Chinese company's plan to build a massive coal mine in New England. 
Mr Turnbull's pitch is simpler: trust the Liberals to manage the economy. When the rest of the world sank into recession during the financial crisis eight years ago, Chinese hunger for Australian minerals and meat kept the country afloat. Australia has weathered the commodity boom's passing better than many expected: growth is a healthy 3.1%. Interest rates are low and the currency is weak, helping investment and exports. A poll by the Lowy Institute, a think-tank, shows that 70% of Australians are optimistic about the economy. Mr Turnbull, a former banker and entrepreneur, argues that his main election pledge--to cut the corporate-tax rate from 30% to 25% over the next decade--will spur investment and create jobs. 
Mr Shorten once supported similar cuts, but now wants them limited to small businesses--to which he will also offer incentives for hiring old people and parents returning to the workforce. Labor vows to match the conservatives' target of balancing the budget in four years, but admits it will run bigger deficits until then, partly because it will spend more on health and education. Mr Shorten says the campaign is a ""referendum"" on Medicare, the public health-insurance scheme that he claims the government wants to privatise. (Mr Turnbull calls that the ""biggest lie in the whole campaign"".) 
Otherwise, Mr Shorten, a lawyer and former union leader, has tried to turn voters' attention from economic to social issues--particularly gay marriage. Mr Abbott, Mr Turnbull's predecessor, opposed gay marriage, but was grudgingly planning a plebiscite on it; polls showed a large majority would vote yes. Mr Turnbull, a gay-marriage supporter, said then that instead of going to the expense of holding a national plebiscite, parliament should vote. But dealmaking with his coalition's conservatives required him to reverse his stand and agree to put gay marriage to a national vote; he ""expects"" it will happen this year if he wins. Mr Shorten says that would be a ""taxpayer-funded platform for homophobia"", and promises to legalise gay marriage within 100 days if Labor wins. 
Mr Shorten has led Labor back into contention just three years after the chaotic rivalry of Ms Gillard and Kevin Rudd, its latest two prime ministers. He has unified his party. But to form a government Labor will have to snatch 19 extra seats in the 150-seat lower house. That will not be easy. Though the parties are tied, in polls that ask voters whom they would prefer as prime minister, Mr Turnbull maintains a comfortable lead. Yet even if he prevails on July 2nd, he may see his majority reduced, and his mandate weaker.","Once the prohibitive favourite , Malcolm Turnbull faces a tight race in Malcolm Turnbull's bid for a second term

In the Conservative Party's leadership contest, Theresa May took 165 votes among MPs, just over half the total. She is expected to advance to a run-off among the party's grassroots.

WHEN Malcolm Turnbull sought a second term for his conservative Liberal-National coalition government by calling an early general election, he promised Australians a break from nearly a decade of dysfunctional politics and short-lived national leaders. The prime minister--Australia's sixth in a decade--asked voters to deliver a mandate for ""strong, stable majority government"" so that he could take them to the ""greatest years in our history"". 
Instead, on July 2nd, they delivered a humiliating verdict. At best, Mr Turnbull may be lucky enough to have a tiny majority with which to form a new government. At worst, he could face a hung parliament with various independents holding the balance of power--and deciding his fate. 
Almost a week after Australians cast their votes, the outcome remained unclear. The government entered the campaign with 90 seats, giving it a majority of 15 in the 150-seat lower chamber, the House of Representatives. With four-fifths of the vote counted, according to the Australian Electoral Commission, Mr Turnbull's government was leading in 74 seats, two short of a majority. The opposition Labor Party, which had 55, was leading in 71. Independents and small parties were ahead in another five seats. One independent, Bob Katter, said he would support Mr Turnbull. 
The prime minister had much riding on the election. A lawyer and successful businessman, he is a man of no very fervent views, but likes enterprise, is socially liberal and leans, like many Australians, towards republicanism. Last September he unseated the divisive Tony Abbott, a social conservative and ultraroyalist, as the Liberals' leader and prime minister. At the time, Mr Turnbull promised a ""different style of leadership""--one that was more inclusive, less dogmatic and, above all, showed greater economic direction. 
At first Mr Turnbull seemed to be rescuing the government from its woeful prospects under Mr Abbott. Opinion polls showed its popularity soaring. His liberal views on gay marriage, support for making Australia a republic and for a market-driven approach to tackling climate change won him widespread support. As prime minister, though, he disappointed many supporters by pushing these issues to one side, and he ignored them in his campaign. Many saw this as a price for appeasing the coalition's conservative wing in deals that installed him as leader. The economic direction never came. Soon, the government's popularity had sunk to put it neck-and-neck with Labor. 
As the election results were coming in, a contrite Mr Turnbull took ""full responsibility"" for the government's poor performance. But he also suggested that it reflected more than popular dissatisfaction with him. There was, he said, ""a level of disillusionment with politics, with government and with the major parties"". Indeed, Liberal and Labor leaders alike have failed to respond to a steady erosion among Australians of traditional political loyalties. 
Until a decade ago, Australia's post-war governments were mostly long-serving and stable (despite three-year parliamentary terms, among the world's briefest). But the left-right, class-defined labels that marked out the old Labor-Liberal divide have long faded. A country built upon immigration, first from Europe and more recently from Asia, Australia is, at least in its cities, ethnically very diverse. Meanwhile, the big parties have floundered over complex new issues, including how to deal with climate change (per person, Australians are huge emitters of carbon), changing social mores and asylum-seekers. 
A kaleidoscope nation, with a two-tone politics: no wonder more young Australians than ever have disengaged from politics. Despite compulsory voting, about a third of 18- to 24-year-olds avoided casting their ballots at this election by not registering for the electoral roll, says Alex Oliver of the Lowy Institute, a think-tank in Sydney. Revolving-door leaders turn many others off. In a recent Lowy poll, two-thirds of Australians rated ""dysfunction in Australian politics"" as being of equal concern as terrorism and threats to national security. 
In their halcyon days the mainstream parties used to share most of the vote between them. This time almost a quarter of votes went to independents and small parties. Ian Marsh, of the University of Technology in Sydney, calls this a ""legitimacy crisis"" for the big parties. The rise of social media and frequent opinion polling appears to have destabilised them further. 
Who wants to be a prime minister? 
The breakdown of tribal affiliations in how people vote is hardly unique to Australia. Neither are the mainstream parties' responses, which are as brutal, and as counter-productive, as anywhere in the West: when opinion polls show popularity plunging, governments on both sides have taken to turning on their leaders instead of confronting their policy dilemmas. Labor MPs replaced Kevin Rudd with Julia Gillard, and vice versa, before either had completed a single term as prime minister. Mr Turnbull then took a leaf out of the Labor playbook by ejecting Mr Abbott. 
Josh Frydenberg, a senior minister in Mr Turnbull's government, says a more frantic polling and media culture has made politics ""more personal and aggressive"". Saul Eslake, an economist, puts it more bluntly: instead of offering a ""compelling vision"", Australia's political leaders focus simply on holding on to power. 
Mr Turnbull offered a broad enough vision. A self-made millionaire, he told voters that ""opportunities have never been greater, nor our horizons wider"". With the economy growing at 3% and unemployment below 6%, Australia has weathered the end of a commodities boom underwritten by Chinese demand better than many expected. Mr Turnbull proposed as his core policy cuts in company taxes over ten years, arguing that this would stimulate jobs and growth. But voters in regions that have been left behind were unconvinced about how this would help them. 
The election's strongest newcomer was a party founded by Nick Xenophon, a centrist who had entered the Senate, the upper house, eight years ago. His home state of South Australia was once a hub of steelmaking, carmaking and shipbuilding. But manufacturing's share of jobs has halved in Australia over the past 26 years, and South Australia has been hit especially hard. His platform mixes populist protection for industry with more immigration to stimulate growth (yes, the case can be made). Rebekha Sharkie, a candidate on his slate, took the prized Liberal seat of Mayo, near Adelaide. Another came close to capturing the formerly safe Liberal seat covering the steelmaking city of Whyalla. 
Meanwhile, the opposition leader, Bill Shorten, emerged as a stronger campaigner than anyone had expected. He argued for Labor's old strengths, such as supporting public health and education, while his shadow treasurer (finance minister), Chris Bowen, worked to persuade voters that Labor could match the coalition in fiscal probity. 
Labor won three Liberal-held seats that cover much of Tasmania, another struggling state. Linda Burney, a Labor candidate who won a suburban constituency of Sydney, becomes Australia's first indigenous woman to sit in the lower house. 
Whatever the outcome in the House of Representatives, the new Senate could prove among a new government's biggest headaches. In March Mr Turnbull won parliamentary approval to simplify a convoluted system of proportional representation under which Australians elected the upper house. 
Normally, half the Senate's 76 members face voters at the same time as the lower house in its three-year cycle. But Mr Turnbull called this election as a ""double dissolution"": an election for all members from both houses at the same time. He expected that the voting reforms would rid the Senate of independents and so-called micro-parties that had often blocked government legislation. 
This was another miscalculation. The new Senate might end up with up to nine members unaligned to the big parties, including possibly three of Mr Xenophon's candidates, depriving the government of a majority there. It could yet doom Mr Turnbull's planned cuts in corporation tax. 
Mr Turnbull remains ""quietly confident"" of winning a majority, once all the votes are counted. But even if he does, his slim margin could damage his authority in his divided party and embolden his conservative enemies. Australia's era of churning political leaders seems far from over.","A general election leaves Australia without a stable government

Street violence was reignited in Indian-ruled Kashmir after security forces killed a prominent militant leader, Burhan Wani. In days of protest by pro-separatist youth, more than 36 people have been killed, nearly all by police gunfire. The insurgency today is being waged less by infiltrators from Pakistan and more by local militants. 
The Liberal-National coalition led by Malcolm Turnbull, the prime minister of Australia, scored a narrow victory in an election.

Mr Turnbull may need the support of small parties and independents, who are likely to hold the balance in the upper house. 
Desperate measures 
As the situation in Venezuela grew more chaotic, President Nicolas Maduro told the army to take over five ports in order to ensure adequate supplies of food and medicine. He said this was necessary because of the ""economic war"" being mounted against him by rivals with the backing of the United States. Venezuela's Catholic bishops warned that the growing role of the military was a threat to civil peace.

A ceasefire halted four days of fighting in South Sudan between soldiers loyal to the president, Salva Kiir, and bodyguards of the vice-president, Riek Machar, a former rebel. Efforts were made to reinstate a peace agreement between the factions. The fighting, which started after a shoot-out at a checkpoint, claimed the lives of 270 people and threatened a return to civil war.

IT WAS hardly the mandate Malcolm Turnbull had hoped for when he called an early general election, asking for a stable majority. On July 10th, eight days after the vote, Australia's prime minister was at last able to claim victory for his conservative Liberal-National coalition. 
But he appeared to have secured only the narrowest of majorities--76 seats in the 150-seat House of Representatives, down from 90 seats previously; late counting may snare one more. But he may still have to rely on independents and small parties (two minnows, Bob Katter and Cathy McGowan, say they will back the prime minister), who are also likely to hold the balance in the Senate, the upper house. 
The tight result could shrink Mr Turnbull's authority in the Liberal Party, the coalition's senior partner. A centrist, he persuaded the Liberals' rightists that he could rescue the party from its dire electoral prospects under his divisive predecessor, Tony Abbott, whom he unseated last September. That now looks unconvincing, and he can expect tensions at the governing parties' first post-election meeting on July 18th. 
A big question hangs over Mr Turnbull's ability to manage the economy. He talks of the need to diversify growth ""fuelled up"" by a mining boom linked to China. With annual GDP growth at 3.1% and an unemployment rate below 6%, Australia has so far managed this transition well. 
But his core campaign promise, to cut Australia's company tax rate from 30% to 25% over the next decade, now seems doomed in the Senate. Moreover, the risk of political gridlock has focused the attention of markets on the budget deficit of A$37 billion ($26 billion), 2.2% of GDP, in the current fiscal year. A balanced budget is not projected before 2020-21. 
After the election Standard & Poor's, a ratings agency, issued a negative outlook on Australia's AAA credit rating: it believes the close result means ""fiscal consolidation may be further postponed"". Saul Eslake, an economist, reckons a ratings downgrade would hit business and consumer confidence. 
So Mr Turnbull's likely inability to push through business tax cuts, which would reduce government revenue by around A$50 billion, could turn out to be his ""saviour"", sharply improving the long-term budget outlook. For now, says Paul Bloxham, an economist at HSBC, markets have been largely untroubled by Australia's result. 
Mr Turnbull will be wary of too much belt-tightening: Bill Shorten, the Labor opposition leader, won votes by promising to champion Australia's public health-insurance system. How Mr Turnbull handles this fiscal dilemma could determine the fortunes of Australia's sixth prime minister in a decade.","A tight victory hurts Malcolm Turnbull's political authority

WHEN he announced plans on July 25th to strengthen Australia's anti-terrorism laws, Malcolm Turnbull, the prime minister, declared that his administration's ""primary duty"" was to keep citizens safe. Within hours Australians were watching videos of government employees doing harm. Inmates of a youth detention centre at Darwin, in the Northern Territory, most of them indigenous children, were shown being thrown on floors, manacled, stunned with tear gas and subjected to other cruel treatment by prison guards. Dylan Voller, then aged 17, was left alone in a cell for two hours after guards had tied his arms, feet and head to a metal chair and put a hood over his face. 
The prison videos were shown on ""Four Corners"", an Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC) programme. Mr Turnbull said he was ""shocked and appalled"" and announced a royal commission inquiry to ""expose the culture that allowed it to occur and allowed it to remain unrevealed for so long"". 
In fact, lawyers and indigenous leaders have long called for government action to cut Australia's high rate of aboriginal youth imprisonment. Mick Gooda, an aboriginal official at the Australian Human Rights Commission, calls it ""one of the most challenging human-rights issues facing our country"". The Northern Territory, a federal dependency, has one of the worst records. Indigenous people are almost a third of the territory's population, compared with 3% for Australia as a whole. But they account for 96% of youngsters aged between 10 and 17 in detention. Amnesty International reported last year that the number of indigenous young people in detention in the territory nearly doubled over the four years to 2014. 
Nationwide, Amnesty says young indigenous Australians are 26 times more likely to be in detention on an average night than their non-indigenous counterparts. It says governments have failed to respond to a ""national crisis"". The exposure of the territory's prison footage, recorded over the past six years, seems to bear this out. Lawyers and journalists had unsuccessfully sought the footage under freedom-of-information laws; whistle-blowers apparently enabled the ABC finally to reveal it. Yet Adam Giles, the territory's chief minister, claimed he had not seen it before. He blamed a ""culture of cover-up"". He could have added blame-shifting. Nigel Scullion, Mr Turnbull's minister for indigenous affairs, ""assumed"" the territory government was handling the problem: ""It did not pique my interest."" 
The high detention rates echo broader problems: indigenous Australians are poorer, unhealthier and do worse in school than their compatriots. Eight years ago, the federal and state governments set targets for ""closing the gap"" with the rest of the country. The scheme's latest report says two crucial areas, jobs and life expectancy, are ""not on track"". Some lawyers blame governments for spinning ""law and order"" as a quick fix although locking up young people often sets them back even more. 
Mr Voller was first detained when he was 11 years old. Now 18, he is in an adult prison and is due for release this year. Gillian Triggs, head of the human rights commission, says it is ""not too extreme"" to compare his treatment to that of prisoners in Abu Ghraib prison during the Iraq war. 
Some want the inquiry to cover youth detention centres around Australia. Mr Turnbull will keep it ""focused"" on those in the Northern Territory; he wants it to report early next year. It will need to be more productive than another inquiry carried out 25 years ago, into high death-in-custody rates among indigenous people. Since then, says Mr Gooda, ""our people are more likely than ever to be incarcerated.""

""NO TWO nations could be closer,"" insists Malcolm Turnbull, Australia's prime minister, of his country's ties with New Zealand. Gary Howes is not so sure. Like many young New Zealanders, he moved to Australia with his family when he was a child. ""Australia is my home,"" he says. But after a brush with the law Mr Howes, now 25 years old, was locked in an immigration detention centre and then deported to New Zealand, a country he says he barely knows. 
Immigration detention centres in Australia now hold almost 200 Kiwis, more than any other nationality (Australia also keeps some would-be immigrants in camps in Papua New Guinea and Nauru). About 650,000 New Zealanders live in Australia, ten times the number of Australians in New Zealand. They are entitled to ""special category"" visas, which allow them to live and work in Australia without restriction. But they are not citizens, and so are subject to the tighter rules on the conduct of immigrants introduced by Tony Abbott, Mr Turnbull's predecessor. In particular, any foreigners who are jailed for a year or more lose their visas automatically. 
Because their visas are otherwise so accommodating, many Kiwis do not bother taking Australian citizenship even after many years' residence. So the new policy has scooped up relatively more New Zealanders than other nationalities. Mr Howes served a two-year prison term for theft. He returned for a shorter stint after breaking parole. While in prison, he received an official letter saying his visa had been cancelled and he would be expelled. 
Peter Dutton, Australia's immigration minister, will not say how many New Zealanders Australia has deported since the law changed. Oz Kiwi, an advocacy group, thinks it is about 600. Joanne Cox of Oz Kiwi accuses Australia of applying the law retrospectively, even to some who had done prison time before the change: ""They were juvenile offenders, now grandparents. Hardly the dregs of society."" 
Amid such outcry, Mr Turnbull six months ago announced a plan to drop visas for some New Zealanders and allow them permanent residence. Eligible Kiwis must have lived in Australia for five years and earn at least A$53,900 (about $41,000) a year. Mr Turnbull called it a ""streamlined pathway to Australian citizenship"". But that does nothing to stop the deportations of less well-paid New Zealanders.","New Zealanders are the unexpected victims of tighter rules for immigrants

SOME 77 days have passed since Britain voted on June 23rd to leave the European Union. Yet this period has been strangely reminiscent of 77 years ago, after Neville Chamberlain declared war on Nazi Germany: a phoney war. Theresa May, the prime minister, has created a new Department for Exiting the EU and put three leading Brexiteers (pictured) in charge of the process. But little else has happened. Article 50 of the EU treaty, which would kick off negotiations, has not been invoked. And Mrs May's mantra, ""Brexit means Brexit"", has become a tired cliche. 
David Davis, secretary of state for the new department, had another go in Parliament on September 5th. Brexit, he explained helpfully, meant leaving the EU. He added that this implied taking back control of borders, laws and taxpayers' money. He brimmed with cheer about the opportunities it would bring. Yet when asked specific questions--Would Britain quit the EU's single market? What migration controls would it seek? Would it stay in Europol? When would negotiations start?--he gave only vague answers. 
That may be quite sensible, for a reason he also offered: that it is more important to get Brexit right than to do it quickly. His department is a work in progress. He has 180 officials and a further 120 in Brussels, but he needs more. As he spoke, he was flanked by his two Brexiteer colleagues, Boris Johnson as foreign secretary and Liam Fox at the Department for International Trade. The three men have been having the usual turf wars and squabbles over exactly what Brexit should entail. 
Tellingly, two hints at answers emerged this week in Asia, not Westminster. In China for the G20 summit, Mrs May disavowed several pledges made by Brexiteers before the referendum. She said she was against an Australian-style ""points"" system for EU migrants (though mainly because it might let in too many, not too few). She refused to back Leavers' promises to transfer saved EU budget payments to the National Health Service or scrap VAT on fuel bills. The not-so-subtle message was that, though the three Brexiteers may be nominally in charge, the real decisions will be taken by her and by Philip Hammond, her chancellor, both of them Remainers. 
A tip from Tokyo 
These two may have welcomed a second Asian intervention: the unusual publication by Japan's foreign ministry of a Brexit paper. Japanese companies, it said, were huge employers in Britain, which took almost half of Japan's investment in the EU last year. Most of that came because Britain is a gateway to Europe. The paper advised Mrs May to try to retain full access to the single market, to avoid customs controls on exports, to preserve the ""passport"" that allows banks based in London to trade across Europe and to let employers freely hire EU nationals. 
These interventions worry Tory Brexiteers, who fret that having won a famous victory in June, they could lose the war. Their fear is that, given the choice, Mrs May and Mr Hammond will lean more to staying in the single market than to taking back full control of migration, money and laws. Mr Davis said this week that having access to the single market was not the same as being a member of it, and added that giving up border control to secure membership was an ""improbable"" outcome. But he was slapped down when Mrs May's spokeswoman said the remark was only Mr Davis's personal opinion. He also talked of retaining as much of the status quo as possible, not least in areas like security and foreign-policy co-operation. 
The case for staying in the single market is simple: economists say this will minimise the economic damage from Brexit. A ""hard"" Brexit that involves leaving the single market without comprehensive free-trade deals with the EU and third countries would mean a bigger drop in investment and output. Brexiteers claim that many countries want free-trade deals and the economy is proving more robust than Remainers forecast. Michael Gove, a leading Brexiteer and former justice secretary, scoffed that soi-disant experts predicting economic doom had ""oeuf on their face"". 
Yet Mrs May is less complacent, acknowledging that it will not be ""plain sailing"" for the economy. Domestic business and financial lobbies are pressing to stay in the single market. As for trade deals, although she won warm words at the G20 summit from Australia's prime minister, Malcolm Turnbull, she was told firmly by Barack Obama and others that bilateral deals with Britain would not be a priority. The climate for free-trade deals is not propitious these days, and Mr Fox's department is bereft of experienced trade negotiators. 
Mrs May has ruled out an early election and a second referendum. She refuses to provide a ""running commentary"" on her Brexit plans. And she insists she can invoke Article 50 without a parliamentary vote. Yet she is being urged by some to delay, since it would set a two-year deadline for Brexit that can be extended only by unanimity among EU leaders. In a thoughtful paper for the think-tank Open Europe, Andrew Tyrie, chairman of the Treasury committee, says the government should first decide what sort of Brexit it wants, adding that its leverage is greater before it pulls the trigger. He suggests waiting until the French election in the spring or even the German one in September. 
Yet Mrs May might not be allowed to wait by her own party, let alone by fellow EU leaders eager to get Brexit out of the way before the European elections in mid-2019.

SELDOM have Australia's complex relations with China been more starkly exposed than in the agonies of Sam Dastyari, a prominent opposition MP. Three months ago Mr Dastyari gave a press conference with Huang Xiangmo, the head of Yuhu Group, a subsidiary of a property company linked to China's government. Contradicting both the government's line and the policy of his own party (Labor), Mr Dastyari called on Australia to ""respect"" China's ill-founded territorial claims in the South China Sea, according to reports in the Chinese press. 
Mr Dastyari, it recently emerged, has accepted donations from Yuhu and from the Top Education Institute, a local firm run by a Chinese-Australian with close ties to the governments of both countries. Mr Dastyari used the money to pay for travel and legal advice. Yuhu also gave Mr Dastyari two bottles of Penfolds Grange, Australia's most expensive wine, worth around A$800 ($600) a bottle. From the G20 summit in China, Malcolm Turnbull, Australia's prime minister, described Mr Dastyari's behaviour as ""cash for comment"". 
On September 7th Mr Dastyari resigned from a post within the Labor party, but not as an MP. Although he admits that accepting the money was ""a big mistake"", he denies any link between the donations and his remarks on the South China Sea. The donations, he points out, had been declared as required and were perfectly legal. Australia's politicians and political parties, it transpires, took A$5.5m in donations from Chinese-linked firms in the two years through June 2015, including A$500,000 from Yuhu. Many are now calling for donations from foreigners to be banned. 
China is Australia's biggest trading partner, and one of its biggest sources of immigrants. Chinese demand for Australian resources, as well as ever-increasing numbers of Chinese tourists and students, have helped to underpin Australia's 25 years of unbroken economic growth. But many Australians worry that the pursuit of Chinese business is undermining their country's independence. 
Mr Turnbull seems to agree. In April his government vetoed a bid by Dakang, a Chinese company, for S. Kidman and Co, a vast outback empire of cattle ranches that owns 2.5% of Australia's agricultural land. Last month it turned down a joint bid by State Grid, a Chinese government-owned company, and Cheung Kong, of Hong Kong, for a 50.4% stake in Ausgrid, an electricity-distribution network in New South Wales, Australia's most populous state. 
Scott Morrison, the treasurer (the most senior finance minister), said both bids were ""contrary to the national interest"", without explaining how. Yet British firms own 7% of Australia's agricultural land, without apparently damaging the national interest. And State Grid already owns stakes in several electricity distributors in other parts of Australia. The rules have not changed since those investments were made but, judging by the uproar about Mr Dastyari, the mood has.

 SELDOM have Australia 's complex relations with China been more starkly exposed than in the agonies of Sam Dastyari , a prominent opposition MP . Three months ago Mr Dastyari gave a press conference with Huang Xiangmo , the head of Yuhu Group , a subsidiary of a property company linked to China 's government . Contradicting both the government 's line and the policy of his own party ( Labor ) , Mr Dastyari called on Australia to "" respect "" China 's ill - founded territorial claims in the South China Sea , according to reports in the Chinese press .

WARREN ENTSCH is a former crocodile-catcher whose federal parliamentary seat covers a remote tropical region of Australia bigger than Bangladesh. His home state of Queensland and his party, the ruling Liberals, are both conservative. Mr Entsch calls himself ""the stereotype redneck"". He is also one of Australia's most unlikely and zealous advocates for making gay marriage legal. Malcolm Turnbull, the prime minister, has called a non-binding referendum on the issue early next year. Mr Entsch and fellow politicians, however, are bitterly divided over whether asking voters is the best approach. Their rancour will be evident when parliament reconvenes on October 10th after nearly a month's break. 
Australia is one of the few rich countries that still bans same-sex marriage. When it was enacted 55 years ago, the federal Marriage Act never defined marriage. Pitching for votes on ""family values"" before an election in 2004, John Howard, a former Liberal prime minister, amended the law to say that it is ""the union of a man and a woman to the exclusion of all others"". A recent opinion poll, however, showed that almost two-thirds of Australians disagree. Just 6% were undecided. 
During a federal election in July, Bill Shorten, the Labor opposition leader, promised to legalise gay marriage within 100 days if Labor won. Mr Turnbull, too, wants change. Last year he suggested a parliamentary vote to decide the issue ""one way or another"". Since then, however, he has tailored his progressive views to keep in line with the stance of Tony Abbott, whom he unseated as Liberal leader and prime minister 13 months ago. 
Mr Abbott had supported his party's gay marriage ban. But after wrangles within the conservative Liberal-National coalition, he had offered a plebiscite (as non-binding referendums are called in Australia) as a compromise. Mr Turnbull last month announced that such a vote would be conducted in February. 
A poll last month showed that only 39% of Australians backed holding a plebiscite. Many fear that some Liberals would simply ignore an outcome that favoured gay marriage. Alan Joyce, the openly gay chief executive of Qantas, an Australian airline, says the legislature has introduced numerous important reforms without a public vote. ""So why can't parliament be empowered to make this decision?"" he asks. Penny Wong, Labor's shadow foreign-affairs minister, says there is ""disappointing evidence"" that some will use ""hurtful"" arguments in a plebiscite campaign. 
Like Ms Wong, but unlike his own Liberal party, Mr Entsch (who is also a patron of a Vietnam war veterans' motorcycle club in his outback region) would prefer a parliamentary vote. ""We don't need to vilify or persecute any minority,"" he says. But he believes Mr Turnbull has little choice but to proceed with the plebiscite his party promised during the recent election campaign. 
Before one happens, parliament must pass an enabling bill. Mr Turnbull's government has a majority (of just one seat) in the lower house, and can count on its support. But it has a minority in the Senate, meaning Labor will play a critical role. Mr Shorten says a plebiscite would represent a ""fundamental failure"" of parliament. 
Many take Mr Shorten's comments as a sign that he will urge Labor to vote against the enabling bill, which would kill it. If that happens, Mr Turnbull would be unlikely to call for a parliamentary vote and thereby risk a revolt in his party. Labor would have to wait for the next general election, which is due in 2019. If it wins, it could push gay-marriage legislation through parliament. For now, it can only take solace in Mr Turnbull's discomfiture.

IT HAS become something of a parlour game among Australian politicians. Ever since 2001, when John Howard, the prime minister of the day, turned away a trawler that had rescued 433 refugees from the sinking boat smuggling them to Australia, successive governments have competed to come up with ever harsher measures to deter asylum-seekers. 
They have been detained, children and the elderly included, in remote desert camps. They have been locked up for years on the Pacific islands of Manus (part of Papua New Guinea) and Nauru while their claims of asylum are processed.

Now Malcolm Turnbull's conservative government has found a way to tighten the screws yet further.

Instead, such people have been packed off to Manus or Nauru to have their asylum claims reviewed. Australia is trying to find third countries to accept those deemed genuine refugees. 
But what if some of those refugees end up somewhere more welcoming (New Zealand has offered to admit some of them), obtain a passport and then come to Australia on a holiday or a business trip? Mr Turnbull finds the idea so harrowing that his government is introducing legislation to prevent it. The bill would ban all adults whose claims have been processed in Manus and Nauru from ever setting foot in Australia. The ban will be retroactive, applying to anyone processed after the government first declared that no one arriving by boat could settle in Australia. 
The boats have slowed to a trickle: 29 have been intercepted since December 2013, whereas 300 arrived in the 12 months before.

At least 1,500 people will be affected by the government's posturing. One is Nayser Ahmed, a member of Myanmar's persecuted Rohingya minority. He was separated from his wife and two children while travelling across Indonesia. His family arrived before the cut-off in 2013; he came just after.

AT ITS inception in 2001, it was seen as a neat answer to a thorny question: how to screen asylum-seekers intercepted at sea on their way to Australia in a manner forbidding enough to deter more from coming? But over time the ""Pacific solution"", of packing the would-be refugees off to camps in Nauru and Papua New Guinea (PNG) to await their fate, itself became a problem. 
Ever more unwelcoming Australian governments declared that even those found to be legitimate refugees would never be admitted to the country, yet few other states could be persuaded to take them, and few of the asylum-seekers could be persuaded to settle in the countries that would, such as Cambodia. Some 2,000 people have mouldered for years in the island camps, earning Australia rebukes from human-rights groups at home and abroad. This week, however, a solution to the solution may perhaps have been found. America has offered to take many of the stranded migrants. (Australia previously offered to admit some Central American refugees in what is being seen as a quid pro quo.) 
Many Australians have an atavistic fear of an uncontrolled flood of Asian migrants, and no government wants to look lax on ""border security"". But keeping the camps running was becoming increasingly difficult. The supreme court in PNG recently declared the camp there illegal and ordered it closed. They are also expensive: UNICEF estimates a bill of A$3.6bn ($2.7bn) for the past three fiscal years alone. And then there was the international opprobrium: Amnesty International's latest report says Australia is ""brazenly flouting international law"" and subjecting detainees to an ""elaborate and cruel system of abuse"". 
The deal had taken ""months and months of very careful planning"", says Malcolm Turnbull, Australia's prime minister. But many Americans are as twitchy about immigration as their counterparts in Australia, as indicated by Donald Trump's election victory. Mr Trump has pledged to bar Muslim migrants from America, and many of the refugees in Nauru and PNG are Muslim. Mr Turnbull seems not to have raised the resettlement plan with Mr Trump when they spoke soon after his election win. ""We deal with one administration at a time,"" he says breezily.

IN GREEK mythology, a gorgon was a creature so hideous that anyone who looked at one turned to stone. In contemporary Australia, Gorgon is an enormous liquefied natural gas (LNG) project which was supposed to pay huge economic dividends. It is the centrepiece of a decade-long, A$200bn ($148bn) construction boom in gas-export facilities. In 2019 Australia is likely to surpass Qatar to become the world's biggest exporter of LNG. The benefits to the government, however, have not been as quite as entrancing as expected. 
At one point Chevron, the company running Gorgon, promised the government so much revenue that it would be able to lower personal income taxes. As recently as March the energy minister, Josh Frydenberg, hailed ""the golden age of gas"" and forecast that Gorgon alone would add a total of A$440bn to the economy. Yet the Treasury says that revenue from the petroleum resources rent tax (PRRT), through which energy firms pay the federal government for the right to extract oil and gas, is forecast to fall from A$1.2bn in the fiscal year that ended in mid-2015 to A$800m in 2020--even as the volume of exports soars. 
That is down to the remarkably generous design of the tax. Unlike most royalty regimes, it is not levied at a flat rate on the volume of gas extracted. Instead, it is linked to the project's profits. Companies are allowed to recoup their exploration and construction costs, which tend to be huge for LNG projects, before any tax is payable. These deductions can be carried forward indefinitely, potentially delaying the Treasury's payday for decades. According to the Australian Tax Office, the value of unused deductions rose from A$1.7bn in 2004-05 fiscal year to A$188bn in 2014-15--meaning that firms can rake in a further A$187bn before paying any tax. 
The generosity was at least partly deliberate, in order to stimulate economically beneficial investment. But a study by the International Transport Workers' Federation suggests the PRRT may have gone too far. Governments of rival exporters, such as Qatar, Malaysia and Nigeria, received two or three times as much revenue as Australia's in 2014 as a proportion of the value of the gas produced. A senator from the Australian Greens, Larissa Waters, has called for a parliamentary inquiry into the tax, describing it as a ""rort"" (Australian slang for scam). One of the original architects of the PRRT, a former trade minister, Craig Emerson, wants an investigation into subsequent government tax breaks that may have further reduced its take. 
There is also dismay at state level. The Liberal government in resource-rich Western Australia, which is behind in the polls for an election in March, has called for a review of government spending in support of LNG projects. But there is little chance of the federal government souring on the gas industry.

FOOTBALL fans must wait four years between World Cups. Education nerds get their fill of global competition every three. The sixth Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA), a test of the science, maths and reading skills of 15-year-olds from across the world, was published by the OECD club of mainly rich countries on December 6th. Its results have telling lessons for policymakers worldwide. 
Some 540,000 pupils in 72 countries or regions--each of whom had finished at least six years of school--sat similar tests last year. The OECD then crunched the results into a standardised scale (see chart 1). In the OECD the average result for each subject is about 490 points. Scoring 30 points above that is roughly akin to completing an extra year of schooling. 
Singapore, the consistently high-achiever in PISA, does even better: it is now the top-performing country in each subject area. The average pupil's maths score of 564 suggests Singaporean teens are roughly three years ahead of their American peers, with a tally of 470. 
Other East Asian countries also score highly across most domains, as they have done since PISA was launched 15 years ago. Japan and South Korea have above-average results in science and maths, as do cities such as Hong Kong and Macau, both autonomous territories of China, and Taipei, the capital of Taiwan. 
Elsewhere, Canada and Finland have reading scores as high as Hong Kong's. Then there is Estonia: its science results are indistinguishable from Japan's and its maths scores are akin to South Korea's. It is now equal with Finland as the top performer in Europe. In turn Finland, which topped the first PISA, is still an above-average performer, but its scores have fallen since at least 2006. 
Opponents of PISA argue that trying to make sense of all this is like trying to hear oneself over the noise of an obstreperous classroom. They note that education is about more than doing well in tests. And besides, some critics add, there is little useful to learn from the results, since it is parents alone that encourage swots. John Jerrim of University College London suggests that the only way some countries could catch up with the East Asian powerhouses is through more ""tiger mothers"" and ""widespread cultural change"". 
PISA has flaws. It is one of many standardised tests, and tests are not all there is to learning. But it matters. It is the most influential research report in education for good reason. It offers informed guidance on what policymakers should do to fix their school systems. Just as importantly, it tells them what not to do. 
It points out that among poorer countries the amount of public spending per pupil is associated with higher test scores. But in richer states that spend more than about $50,000 per pupil in total between 6 and 15 this link falls away (see chart 2). The pupils of Poland and Denmark have, in effect, the same average results in the science tests even though Denmark spends about 50% more per pupil. 
Another potential waste of money, if only from the perspective of PISA results, may be sending children to private school. Across the OECD pupils in public schools score lower in science than students in private schools do. But this is not the case once you account for the economic and social background of pupils. 
And while poverty is strongly associated with low scores, it is not destiny. In the OECD poor pupils are nearly three times more likely than their rich peers to have less than the basic level of proficiency in science. Those pupils with foreign-born parents tend to do even worse. Nevertheless, 29% of poor pupils score among the top quarter of children across the OECD. In Singapore, Japan and Estonia nearly half of the poorest pupils do. 
Money isn't everything 
That hints at another finding: achievement and greater equality are not mutually exclusive. In Canada, Denmark, Estonia, Hong Kong and Macau pupils have high average scores, with only a weak link between results and children's backgrounds. 
One reason for Estonia's gain is demographic loss. Over the past 20 years the population of young people has declined faster than the number of teachers. There is now one teacher for every 12 pupils, down from closer to 20 two decades ago. Although in general reducing class sizes is not the most cost-effective response, Estonian pupils have benefited from the demographic shift, which has made it easier to give pupils, especially laggards, extra help. 
But Estonia has also taken a deliberately inclusive approach, argues Mart Laidmets, a senior official at its ministry of education. It tries to avoid at all costs having pupils repeat years of school. Holding pupils back can help. But too often it is used as an excuse not to teach difficult kids. It may also reflect bias or discrimination. In countries such as Russia, Slovakia and the Czech Republic, poor boys are especially prone to being kept back a year, despite decent academic achievements. 
Estonia, like Finland and Canada, also tries to keep selection by ability to a minimum. It delays ""tracking"" children into academic or vocational routes until they are 15 or 16 years old. Mr Laidmets argues that it helps pupils find jobs later in life, since better maths and literacy make it easier for them to adapt to changes in the labour market and to earn new skills. 
By contrast, where pupils are diverted from an academic track at an early age, whether towards a vocational school or a less rigorous class in the same school, the gap between rich and poor children tends to be wider. In the Netherlands pupils at vocational schools have results equivalent to about three years less of schooling than their peers at general schools. ""The more academically selective you are the more socially selective you become"", says Andreas Schleicher, the head of education at the OECD. 
All of which suggests what countries should not do. But are there any sure-fire tips from the best performers? Or is their success just down to pushy parents and tuition after school? 
Culture matters but so, too, does policy, says Lucy Crehan, author of ""Cleverlands"", a new book on PISA-besting countries. She points out that most of these states delay formal schooling until children are six or seven. Instead they use early-years education to prepare children for school through play-based learning and by focusing on social skills. Then they keep pupils in academic courses until the age of 16. Even Singapore, which does divert some pupils to a vocational track at the age of 13, ensures that pupils in those schools keep up high standards in reading and maths. 
Top performers also focus their time and effort on what goes on in the classroom, rather than the structure of the school system. For while test scores and pupils' economic background are linked across the OECD, so too are specific things that the best schools and teachers do (see chart 3). 
The top performers treat teachers as professionals and teachers act that way as well. They have time to prepare lessons and learn from their peers. They tend to direct classroom instruction rather than be led by their pupils. Their advancement is determined by results, not by teachers' unions. There are high expectations of nearly every student and high standards, too. 
A keener Argentina 
The teenagers who took the PISA tests in 2015 were influenced by many years' worth of policies. And focusing on the consistently high performers means that lessons from those that have made recent improvements are neglected. 
The city of Buenos Aires had the largest jump in overall scores from three years ago. On average its pupils scored 475 in science (up 51 points), 475 in reading (46 points) and 456 points (38 points) in maths. 
For Esteban Bullrich, the minister in charge of education from 2010 to 2015, the initial aim was to make sure that pupils were being taught. Teachers were spending 12-15 days per year on strike, or about 7% of the time they should be in class, according to his calculations. To try to reduce those absences he first made his mobile-phone number public and began fielding calls directly from angry teachers. He extended the school day. 
Then he offered teachers something of a deal: higher salaries in exchange for taking their job more seriously. The grip of unions in deciding on promotions was loosened. And he made teacher training more rigorous and practical. 
Another impressive mover, albeit more of a tortoise than a hare, is Portugal. Since 2006 it has steadily improved its scores across each subject by about a year of schooling, overtaking the United States as it went from a middling to an above-average performer. 
There are three reasons for Portugal's steady progress, says Nuno Crato, the country's former education minister. First, it began to care about results, introducing new standardised tests. Second, a new curriculum with higher standards was introduced from 2011. Third, it has reduced the amount of streaming by ability, keeping its use ""temporary and partial"". Struggling pupils may get extra tuition but teachers will try to keep them in the same classes as their peers. 
For Portugal to become an educational powerhouse, argues Mr Crato, it also needs ""better-prepared teachers"". This is hard when some teaching unions oppose their members having to pass exams before they are allowed into classrooms. What better education does not necessarily need is bigger budgets, he says. Portugal's improvements have come despite severe cuts to public spending. ""Money matters but it is not decisive,"" adds Mr Crato. 
Progress can also be spotted even among countries whose overall scores have remained flat. The economic background of the average American pupil matters much less to their overall test scores than in earlier editions of PISA. Mr Schleicher puts this down to reforms such as President George W. Bush's No Child Left Behind Act, which made local governments more accountable for the results of poorer pupils. 
The PISA results are not all happy tales of plucky reform. Australia is one of several countries whose results have dipped. Its average score in maths has fallen from 524 to 494 since 2003, equivalent to a year of schooling. Australia is one of the few rich countries where pupils do not have to take maths in their leaving exams. (Malcolm Turnbull, the prime minister, is trying to make states change this.) It is also a result of a declining quality of teaching, suggests John Hattie of the University of Melbourne. Successful applicants to teacher-training courses have lower results in their school exams than in the 1980s and 1990s. 
Nevertheless, while some countries rise and others fall, many are just like England. Its results have barely budged since 2006. (Scotland's have plummeted.) The average result for OECD countries has similarly hardly changed since the tests began. This may reflect well on the test-setters: it would be worrying if the results swung wildly from edition to edition. 
Yet it still reflects poorly on many policymakers. Mr Bullrich says PISA is like an X-ray of a country's education policy. It is not a full picture of your health but it can help you spot where things are sickly. Sadly, too many countries are dodging essential therapy.","The latest PISA tests suggest that reforming education is slow and hard, but eminently possible 
FOOTBALL fans must wait four years between World Cups. Education nerds get their fill of global competition every three. The sixth Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA), a test of the science, maths and reading skills of 15-year-olds from across the world, was published by the OECD club of mainly rich countries on December 6th. Its results have telling lessons for policymakers worldwide. 
Some 540,000 pupils in 72 countries or regions--each of whom had finished at least six years of school--sat similar tests last year. The OECD then crunched the results into a standardised scale (see chart 1). In the OECD the average result for each subject is about 490 points. Scoring 30 points above that is roughly akin to completing an extra year of schooling. 
Singapore, the consistently high-achiever in PISA, does even better: it is now the top-performing country in each subject area. The average pupil's maths score of 564 suggests Singaporean teens are roughly three years ahead of their American peers, with a tally of 470. 
Other East Asian countries also score highly across most domains, as they have done since PISA was launched 15 years ago. Japan and South Korea have above-average results in science and maths, as do cities such as Hong Kong and Macau, both autonomous territories of China, and Taipei, the capital of Taiwan. 
Elsewhere, Canada and Finland have reading scores as high as Hong Kong's. Then there is Estonia: its science results are indistinguishable from Japan's and its maths scores are akin to South Korea's. It is now equal with Finland as the top performer in Europe. In turn Finland, which topped the first PISA, is still an above-average performer, but its scores have fallen since at least 2006. 
Opponents of PISA argue that trying to make sense of all this is like trying to hear oneself over the noise of an obstreperous classroom. They note that education is about more than doing well in tests. And besides, some critics add, there is little useful to learn from the results, since it is parents alone that encourage swots. John Jerrim of University College London suggests that the only way some countries could catch up with the East Asian powerhouses is through more ""tiger mothers"" and ""widespread cultural change"". 
PISA has flaws. It is one of many standardised tests, and tests are not all there is to learning. But it matters. It is the most influential research report in education for good reason. It offers informed guidance on what policymakers should do to fix their school systems. Just as importantly, it tells them what not to do. 
It points out that among poorer countries the amount of public spending per pupil is associated with higher test scores. But in richer states that spend more than about $50,000 per pupil in total between 6 and 15 this link falls away (see chart 2). The pupils of Poland and Denmark have, in effect, the same average results in the science tests even though Denmark spends about 50% more per pupil. 
Another potential waste of money, if only from the perspective of PISA results, may be sending children to private school. Across the OECD pupils in public schools score lower in science than students in private schools do. But this is not the case once you account for the economic and social background of pupils. 
And while poverty is strongly associated with low scores, it is not destiny. In the OECD poor pupils are nearly three times more likely than their rich peers to have less than the basic level of proficiency in science.

HAVING scraped back to power with a one-seat majority last year, Malcolm Turnbull always expected ""plenty of surprises and challenges in 2017"". He did not expect them to start so soon. On January 13th the prime minister accepted the resignation of Sussan Ley, his health minister, after claims that she had misused taxpayers' money. As the scandal erupted, the government was pursuing spending cuts and clamping down on some welfare recipients in a bid to balance the budget. That made it all the more embarrassing that Ms Ley had bought an investment property worth almost A$800,000 ($600,000) in 2015, while on a government-paid visit to the Gold Coast in Queensland. 
Ms Ley tried to explain the apparent blurring of public and private business by suggesting, to widespread derision, that she had bought the flat on impulse. A string of revelations followed: she had charged taxpayers for several other Gold Coast trips; two were to New Year's Eve parties hosted by a businesswoman who had donated money to the ruling Liberal Party; she had chartered planes to fly to official engagements instead of taking commercial flights at a fraction of the cost (she is a pilot) and so on. Ms Ley called the furore a ""distraction"" but has agreed to repay some of the money she claimed. 
Ms Ley has been one of the more talented and colourful members of Mr Turnbull's cabinet. Born in Nigeria, she has been a cattle farmer, a cook for sheep shearers and an official in the Australian Taxation Office. Yet she failed to heed the lessons of ""Choppergate"", an expenses scandal that rocked the government 17 months ago. Bronwyn Bishop, then speaker of the lower house, quit after the disclosure that she had spent more than $5,000 chartering a helicopter to attend a Liberal fundraising event. Politicians from both sides have charged taxpayers thousands to fly their families with them to events in the farthest corners of the country. Australians have paid for Julie Bishop, the foreign minister, to attend a polo match. Steve Ciobo, the trade minister, says taxpayers ""expect"" to pay for politicians to go to sporting events. 
Perhaps. But opaque rules have given politicians leeway in judging how much they can get away with. An inquiry after Choppergate called the laws on parliamentary expenses a ""complex patchwork"" that was ""close to impossible"" to understand and administer. In the wake of the latest scandal, Mr Turnbull has promised to shift responsibility for overseeing MPs' claims to a new independent agency run by auditing experts, a former judge and a former MP. Politicians will also have to disclose expenses monthly instead of twice a year. Mr Turnbull reckons the new system's independence and openness will ""make a very big change"". This year will be all the trickier for him if it does not.","A series of scandals prompts tougher rules on politicians ' expenses

WITHIN hours of signing his executive order restricting travel from seven Muslim countries, President Donald Trump called King Salman of Saudi Arabia to discuss closer ties. ""Trump reassures the allies...and the travel restrictions befuddle the world"", read the front-page banner of Asharq Al-Alawsat, a newspaper owned by the king's son, on the following day. 
Some of America's allies may be reassured; but many of them are aghast at a foreign policy that seems determined to destroy many of the institutions and alliances created in the past half century. A telephone call between Mr Trump and Malcolm Turnbull, the prime minister of Australia, is reported to have turned remarkably sour over a previous American pledge to resettle refugees. Strikingly, Donald Tusk, president of the European Council, wrote to 27 European leaders listing America alongside Russia, China and terrorism among the main external threats to the European Union. Meanwhile Enrique Pena Nieto, Mexico's president, cancelled a meeting with Mr Trump. 
Some satisfaction on the part of Saudi Arabia is not surprising; like Egypt and the United Arab Emirates, two other Sunni countries, it was not targeted by the freeze on visas (see map). Gulf leaders disliked Barack Obama. And Mr Trump seems better disposed to despots than his predecessor; he has praised Egypt's president, Abdel-Fattah al-Sisi, as ""a fantastic guy"". And many Arab states impose tight access restrictions on fellow Muslims. 
Above all, Saudi Arabia saw the travel ban as re-establishing the isolation of its chief adversary, Iran, and other Shia dominated states. It will have been further delighted when, on February 1st, Mr Trump's national security adviser, Michael Flynn, said America was ""putting Iran on notice"" for destabilising the Middle East after a recent ballistic missile test and an attack by its Houthi allies on a Saudi frigate. 
A veteran Saudi commentator, Abdulrahman al-Rashed, notes that ""Trump's administration sees Iran as part of the problem, unlike the Obama administration, which viewed it as part of the solution."" Rex Tillerson, the secretary of state, is well known in Riyadh. As head of Exxon Mobil before taking office, he visited the Gulf as recently as November. ""He's as friendly to Saudi Arabia as it gets,"" said a diplomat. 
Iran's reaction was as furious as Saudi Arabia's was smug, with hardliners and reformers alike reviving old revolutionary slogans. ""It's increasing Iran's isolation at a time when the country desperately wants to be part of the global community,"" said Ali Alizadeh, an Iranian commentator. Valiollah Seif, the central bank governor announced that in March Iran would replace the dollar with other currencies in its accounting for foreign transactions. 
Saudi glee could, however, be short-lived: America's intention to treat non-Muslim refugees preferentially, and its anti-Muslim rhetoric, could play into the hands of global jihadists who, like Mr Trump's adviser, Stephen Bannon, see a clash between Islamic and Christian civilisations. 
In such a division it might seem natural to find America and Europe on the same side, even if such talk gives many Europeans the heebie-jeebies. But Mr Trump's policies also seem designed to split him off from many of Europe's leaders--and to exacerbate ructions within their countries. 
Angela Merkel, the German chancellor and an Atlanticist to her bones, declared the executive order's ""general suspicion"" of Muslims unjustified, a sentiment echoed in many other European capitals. A later clarification that EU citizens would not be affected so long as they were not travelling on a passport issued by one of the seven countries brought some mollification. But European leaders have a deeper concern: that Mr Trump may halt or reverse America's support for European integration, long a bipartisan staple of American foreign policy. Ted Malloch, who has been canvassed as a possible ambassador to the EU, has compared it to the Soviet Union and suggested he might like to help bring it down. Last year Mr Tusk and several other European leaders were rattled by post-election courtesy calls in which Mr Trump had gleefully solicited opinions on which country might be first to follow Britain out of the EU. 
A further adversarial note was struck when, on January 31st, Peter Navarro, Mr Trump's senior trade adviser, declared TTIP, a half-negotiated trade pact between the EU and America, to be dead, and accused Germany of exploiting an undervalued euro to help its exporters. In the wake of Mr Trump's withdrawal from the TTP, a trade agreement between 12 Pacific Rim countries, this will spur on European efforts to conclude trade deals elsewhere, notably with Japan and Mexico, which is also looking to deepen ties with big economies other than America. Although the EU recently slapped tariffs on Chinese steel, some Europeans, like the Mexicans, see possibilities there, too. President Xi Jinping's paean to globalisation at Davos last month went down well. 
The British exception 
Yet Europe's unity is, as Mr Trump reminds it, fragile. Take Russia policy. If America lifts the sanctions it imposed on Russia after its annexation of Crimea and invasion of eastern Ukraine, Mrs Merkel will struggle to maintain a consensus on Europe's own economic measures, which must be renewed in the summer. 
The British prime minister, Theresa May, became the first head of government to visit the new president. She is betting that getting close to Mr Trump may help smooth some of his rougher edges. During their meeting she worked hard to convince him that he will have more leverage with Russia if NATO is strong; he has repeatedly questioned the value of the ""obsolete"" alliance (see ""Lexington: Strength in numbers""). 
Embracing Mr Trump carries risks. The president is unpopular in Britain. Nearly 2m people have signed an online petition urging Mrs May to cancel the state visit she promised the Donald (see ""Euroscepticism and Trumpism: Mr Brexit's homecoming""). Her counterparts in the Brexit negotiations may be similarly unimpressed. Many of Britain's Brexiteers, though, see themselves as part of the anti-elitist ""global revolt"" Mr Bannon embraces. Europe's right-wing populists fell over themselves to celebrate America's visa restrictions. Geert Wilders of the anti-Islam Freedom Party, which is leading opinion polls in the Netherlands six weeks before a general election, said that similar bans in Europe would have thwarted terrorist attacks. ""Racist? No. Simply GREAT,"" tweeted Matteo Salvini of Italy's far-right Northern League. Politicians like these see in Mr Trump not only vindication of their anti-elite, anti-immigrant instincts, but a president who shares their bleak analysis of contemporary Europe. On the campaign trail Mr Trump painted apocalyptic pictures of the continent beset by terrorism and ethnic strife. 
In the coming months Mr Trump will probably meet some of his European counterparts in the flesh at a NATO summit in Brussels--a ""hellhole"", as he once called it. He has already met his Mexican opposite number, President Pena, having made a visit to Mexico City during his campaign. But after further humiliating demands that Mexico pay for the border wall Mr Trump promised during his campaign a return visit was scotched. Relations between the two countries may be at their lowest ebb since 1916, when Woodrow Wilson sent over 6,000 soldiers into Mexico in pursuit of Francisco ""Pancho"" Villa. (There are reports, which the Mexican government denies, that in a telephone conversation with Mr Pena Mr Trump spoke of using American troops to hunt down criminals south of the border.) 
Carlos Slim, a multibillionaire businessman who is the only Mexican to have met Mr Trump since election day, says he is ""not a terminator but a negotiator"". Mr Trump's anti-Mexican rhetoric, in other words, could be an opening gambit. But much as politicians hope this is true, they are preparing for the worst. 
The Mexican people are unusually unified in their opposition to Mr Trump's politicking. Mr Pena, who has a popularity rating of just 12%, was excoriated for inviting Mr Trump to Mexico City last year; his newly forthright stance has earned plaudits. But the most likely beneficiary of Mexico's dislike of Mr Trump is Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, leader of the hard-left Morena party. His strident nationalism appeals to voters who want a leader to stand up to Mr Trump. Since the American election, Mr Lopez Obrador has risen 7-8 percentage points in the polls; at the same time the IMF'sprojections for GDP growth in 2017 have dropped from 2.3% to 1.7%. 
With the oil price down, NAFTA-dependent trade is more or less the only motor the economy has. A floundering economy, a fractured political landscape and an anti-Trump boost could give Mr Lopez Obrador the top job after Mexico's 2018 presidential election. That would put at risk the structural reforms in energy, telecoms and education that represent some of the few gains Mr Pena's administration has made, and the stability that has been fundamental to the development of the Mexican-American relationship for decades. 
A slowing Mexico led by an anti-American president would deliver little benefit on the other side of the Rio Grande. Contrary to Mr Trump's rhetoric, firms that increase the number of their employees south of the border also increase them to the north--along with their R&D spending. And Mexico could import food from Brazil and Argentina at little extra cost. Those who facilitate illegal immigration from Central America will benefit from reduced co-ordination. So would drug smugglers, who are pretty well versed in tunnelling under walls, whatever their beauty. Hence Mr Pena's offer of a grand bargain in which trade, migration and security issues would be discussed together. 
Mexico might also give serious thought to delaying. Trade negotiations, in particular, can take a very long time: why rush them? If there is a new administration in 2021 America's policies could be very different. Others may seek similar solace. But hoping four years could be a mere unpalatable interlude sits poorly with the change two weeks have brought the world.
Caption: Maybe we won't always have Paris; Well, that was fun","The executive order on visas and refugees is not the only worry other countries have about Trump's America 
WITHIN hours of signing his executive order restricting travel from seven Muslim countries, President Donald Trump called King Salman of Saudi Arabia to discuss closer ties. ""Trump reassures the allies...and the travel restrictions befuddle the world"", read the front-page banner of Asharq Al-Alawsat, a newspaper owned by the king's son, on the following day. 
Some of America's allies may be reassured; but many of them are aghast at a foreign policy that seems determined to destroy many of the institutions and alliances created in the past half century. A telephone call between Mr Trump and Malcolm Turnbull, the prime minister of Australia, is reported to have turned remarkably sour over a previous American pledge to resettle refugees. Strikingly, Donald Tusk, president of the European Council, wrote to 27 European leaders listing America alongside Russia, China and terrorism among the main external threats to the European Union. Meanwhile Enrique Pena Nieto, Mexico's president, cancelled a meeting with Mr Trump. 
Some satisfaction on the part of Saudi Arabia is not surprising; like Egypt and the United Arab Emirates, two other Sunni countries, it was not targeted by the freeze on visas (see map). Gulf leaders disliked Barack Obama. And Mr Trump seems better disposed to despots than his predecessor; he has praised Egypt's president, Abdel-Fattah al-Sisi, as ""a fantastic guy"". And many Arab states impose tight access restrictions on fellow Muslims. 
Above all, Saudi Arabia saw the travel ban as re-establishing the isolation of its chief adversary, Iran, and other Shia dominated states. It will have been further delighted when, on February 1st, Mr Trump's national security adviser, Michael Flynn, said America was ""putting Iran on notice"" for destabilising the Middle East after a recent ballistic missile test and an attack by its Houthi allies on a Saudi frigate. 
A veteran Saudi commentator, Abdulrahman al-Rashed, notes that ""Trump's administration sees Iran as part of the problem, unlike the Obama administration, which viewed it as part of the solution."" Rex Tillerson, the secretary of state, is well known in Riyadh. As head of Exxon Mobil before taking office, he visited the Gulf as recently as November. ""He's as friendly to Saudi Arabia as it gets,"" said a diplomat. 
Iran's reaction was as furious as Saudi Arabia's was smug, with hardliners and reformers alike reviving old revolutionary slogans. ""It's increasing Iran's isolation at a time when the country desperately wants to be part of the global community,"" said Ali Alizadeh, an Iranian commentator. Valiollah Seif, the central bank governor announced that in March Iran would replace the dollar with other currencies in its accounting for foreign transactions. 
Saudi glee could, however, be short-lived: America's intention to treat non-Muslim refugees preferentially, and its anti-Muslim rhetoric, could play into the hands of global jihadists who, like Mr Trump's adviser, Stephen Bannon, see a clash between Islamic and Christian civilisations. 
In such a division it might seem natural to find America and Europe on the same side, even if such talk gives many Europeans the heebie-jeebies. But Mr Trump's policies also seem designed to split him off from many of Europe's leaders--and to exacerbate ructions within their countries. 
Angela Merkel, the German chancellor and an Atlanticist to her bones, declared the executive order's ""general suspicion"" of Muslims unjustified, a sentiment echoed in many other European capitals. A later clarification that EU citizens would not be affected so long as they were not travelling on a passport issued by one of the seven countries brought some mollification. But European leaders have a deeper concern: that Mr Trump may halt or reverse America's support for European integration, long a bipartisan staple of American foreign policy. Ted Malloch, who has been canvassed as a possible ambassador to the EU, has compared it to the Soviet Union and suggested he might like to help bring it down. Last year Mr Tusk and several other European leaders were rattled by post-election courtesy calls in which Mr Trump had gleefully solicited opinions on which country might be first to follow Britain out of the EU. 
A further adversarial note was struck when, on January 31st, Peter Navarro, Mr Trump's senior trade adviser, declared TTIP, a half-negotiated trade pact between the EU and America, to be dead, and accused Germany of exploiting an undervalued euro to help its exporters. In the wake of Mr Trump's withdrawal from the TTP, a trade agreement between 12 Pacific Rim countries, this will spur on European efforts to conclude trade deals elsewhere, notably with Japan and Mexico, which is also looking to deepen ties with big economies other than America. Although the EU recently slapped tariffs on Chinese steel, some Europeans, like the Mexicans, see possibilities there, too. President Xi Jinping's paean to globalisation at Davos last month went down well. 
The British exception 
Yet Europe's unity is, as Mr Trump reminds it, fragile. Take Russia policy. If America lifts the sanctions it imposed on Russia after its annexation of Crimea and invasion of eastern Ukraine, Mrs Merkel will struggle to maintain a consensus on Europe's own economic measures, which must be renewed in the summer. 
The British prime minister, Theresa May, became the first head of government to visit the new president. She is betting that getting close to Mr Trump may help smooth some of his rougher edges. During their meeting she worked hard to convince him that he will have more leverage with Russia if NATO is strong; he has repeatedly questioned the value of the ""obsolete"" alliance (see ""Lexington: Strength in numbers""). 
Embracing Mr Trump carries risks. The president is unpopular in Britain. Nearly 2m people have signed an online petition urging Mrs May to cancel the state visit she promised the Donald (see ""Euroscepticism and Trumpism: Mr Brexit's homecoming""). Her counterparts in the Brexit negotiations may be similarly unimpressed. Many of Britain's Brexiteers, though, see themselves as part of the anti-elitist ""global revolt"" Mr Bannon embraces. Europe's right-wing populists fell over themselves to celebrate America's visa restrictions. Geert Wilders of the anti-Islam Freedom Party, which is leading opinion polls in the Netherlands six weeks before a general election, said that similar bans in Europe would have thwarted terrorist attacks. ""Racist? No. Simply GREAT,"" tweeted Matteo Salvini of Italy's far-right Northern League. Politicians like these see in Mr Trump not only vindication of their anti-elite, anti-immigrant instincts, but a president who shares their bleak analysis of contemporary Europe. On the campaign trail Mr Trump painted apocalyptic pictures of the continent beset by terrorism and ethnic strife. 
In the coming months Mr Trump will probably meet some of his European counterparts in the flesh at a NATO summit in Brussels--a ""hellhole"", as he once called it. He has already met his Mexican opposite number, President Pena, having made a visit to Mexico City during his campaign. But after further humiliating demands that Mexico pay for the border wall Mr Trump promised during his campaign a return visit was scotched. Relations between the two countries may be at their lowest ebb since 1916, when Woodrow Wilson sent over 6,000 soldiers into Mexico in pursuit of Francisco ""Pancho"" Villa. (There are reports, which the Mexican government denies, that in a telephone conversation with Mr Pena Mr Trump spoke of using American troops to hunt down criminals south of the border.) 
Carlos Slim, a multibillionaire businessman who is the only Mexican to have met Mr Trump since election day, says he is ""not a terminator but a negotiator"". Mr Trump's anti-Mexican rhetoric, in other words, could be an opening gambit. But much as politicians hope this is true, they are preparing for the worst. 
The Mexican people are unusually unified in their opposition to Mr Trump's politicking. Mr Pena, who has a popularity rating of just 12%, was excoriated for inviting Mr Trump to Mexico City last year; his newly forthright stance has earned plaudits. But the most likely beneficiary of Mexico's dislike of Mr Trump is Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, leader of the hard-left Morena party. His strident nationalism appeals to voters who want a leader to stand up to Mr Trump. Since the American election, Mr Lopez Obrador has risen 7-8 percentage points in the polls; at the same time the IMF'sprojections for GDP growth in 2017 have dropped from 2.3% to 1.7%. 
With the oil price down, NAFTA-dependent trade is more or less the only motor the economy has. A floundering economy, a fractured political landscape and an anti-Trump boost could give Mr Lopez Obrador the top job after Mexico's 2018 presidential election. That would put at risk the structural reforms in energy, telecoms and education that represent some of the few gains Mr Pena's administration has made, and the stability that has been fundamental to the development of the Mexican-American relationship for decades. 
A slowing Mexico led by an anti-American president would deliver little benefit on the other side of the Rio Grande. Contrary to Mr Trump's rhetoric, firms that increase the number of their employees south of the border also increase them to the north--along with their R&D spending. And Mexico could import food from Brazil and Argentina at little extra cost. Those who facilitate illegal immigration from Central America will benefit from reduced co-ordination. So would drug smugglers, who are pretty well versed in tunnelling under walls, whatever their beauty. Hence Mr Pena's offer of a grand bargain in which trade, migration and security issues would be discussed together. 
Mexico might also give serious thought to delaying. Trade negotiations, in particular, can take a very long time: why rush them? If there is a new administration in 2021 America's policies could be very different. Others may seek similar solace. But hoping four years could be a mere unpalatable interlude sits poorly with the change two weeks have brought the world.

BARACK OBAMA was bad for satirists, even if few seemed to mind. Moderate, upstanding and cool, the first black president gave close observers of human ridiculousness little to work with. Most gave up and welcomed him admiringly onto their shows. ""I can't believe you're leaving before me,"" Mr Obama, appearing on ""The Daily Show"" for the seventh time, told its outgoing host, Jon Stewart. It was not the relationship to power the acerbic Mr Stewart would have liked. Thankfully, Donald Trump is making satire great again. 
The most conspicuous beneficiary, ""Saturday Night Live"" (SNL), a hitherto jaded platform for comedy skits on NBC, is seeing its best ratings in over 20 years. This is partly thanks to Alec Baldwin's parody of the president as an irascible halfwit. But the chaos in the month-old administration has provided additional targets. On February 4th SNL unveiled a hilarious parody of Sean Spicer, the White House press secretary, as a gum-chewing maniac. The belligerent Mr Spicer has since appeared cowed. 
There are a couple of lessons here for more sober political commentators. One is to abandon the complacency about Mr Trump that, until Mr Baldwin took over in October, had rendered SNL's portrayal of him toothless and pointless. Another is to let the weirdness of this presidency speak for itself. ""America first, Australia sucks. Your reef is failing. Prepare to go to war,"" the SNL Trump blustered down the phone to Australia's president, Malcolm Turnbull, on February 4th. That, minus the threat of war, is pretty much what Mr Trump said to Mr Turnbull in a recent phone call. 
Other satirists are finding Mr Trump's tendency to defy parody harder to handle. ""It's really tricky now as satire has become reality,"" Trey Parker, co-creator of ""South Park"", a satirical cartoon which presented the Trump-Clinton contest as the ""giant douche or the turd sandwich"", has said.The Onion has the same problem. One of the satirical online paper's recent headlines, ""Eric Trump Scolds Father That He Mustn't Inquire About The Businesses, For He's Sworn Not To Tell,"" is a pretty faithful description of the firewall between the 45th president and his family firm. 
Indeed, many of the headlines generated by Mr Trump's administration are deeply Onion-esque. Kellyanne Conway, a Trump spokeswoman, was briefly barred by CNN for using alternative facts--her references to a fictitious jihadist atrocity, which Ms Conway called the ""Bowling Green Massacre"", were the last straw. Mr Trump's wife, Melania, has sued a newspaper for reporting lurid untruths about her on the basis that this cost her the ""once-in-a-lifetime opportunity"" of making millions as ""one of the most photographed women in the world"". No satirist could do better. SNL's response, in sending up Mr Spicer, is to shift the focus onto one of the relatively normal players in Trump world, to show how pervasively strange it is. 
At first glance, none of this should bother Mr Trump. SNL's weekly audience of 10m represents less than half his Twitter following and is dominated by left-leaning millennials who would sooner work in an abattoir than vote Trump. Yet Mr Trump, who unlike his core voters devours the mainstream media and loves to hobnob with the celebrities who appear on shows like SNL, minds the lampooning a lot. ""Not funny, cast is terrible, always a complete hit job. Really bad television!"" he tweeted last month. SNL's response was to start planning ways to take Mr Baldwin's impression, which the actor has described as a civic duty, to a wider audience.","Lessons in civics from comedians

AFTER Donald Trump's victory in November, Malcolm Turnbull quickly congratulated him, having obtained Mr Trump's telephone number from Greg Norman, the new president's golfing buddy. Australia's prime minister claimed a similar background to Mr Trump's, as ""businessmen who found our way into politics somewhat later in life"", and a shared ""pragmatic approach"" to solving problems. Another call, just two months later, has shattered this supposed solidarity. It has also prompted many Australians to question their country's closest alliance. 
On February 2nd the Washington Post published an account of the second call. Mr Turnbull raised a deal his government had struck with the administration of Barack Obama, in which America agreed to resettle refugees trying to reach Australia who had been diverted to Nauru and Papua New Guinea. Mr Turnbull later assured Australians that Mr Trump would ""honour"" the deal. But the leaked account differed. Mr Trump reportedly called it the ""worst deal ever"", accused Australia of seeking to export the ""next Boston bomber"" and told Mr Turnbull that his was the ""worst call by far"" among his conversations with world leaders that day. 
Mr Turnbull is renowned for his own short fuse. Indeed, some colleagues see him as a ""sophisticated"" version of Mr Trump. Clashing with Mr Trump seems to have done him little political damage at home. But if Mr Trump says he will not accept the 1,250 refugees, many of whom are from Muslim countries, that could change. The camps where the refugees are being held are a constant source of diplomatic irritation and embarrassment; the government would dearly like to close them. One fear is that Mr Trump might ask for something in return, such as sending more troops to the Middle East, that would go down badly with many Australians. 
The alliance with America is the centrepiece of Australia's foreign policy. Indeed, it has strengthened in recent years, with America stationing troops in Darwin, in the far north. But China's emergence as Australia's biggest trading partner has prompted a debate about how to strike a balance in relations with the two countries, and Mr Trump's election has intensified it. A poll last year by the Lowy Institute, a think-tank, found almost half of Australians thought their country should distance itself from America ""if it elects a president like Donald Trump"". James Curran, a historian, argues in ""Fighting with America"", a new book, that Australia should ditch ""worn rhetoric"" and ""alarming complacency"" about relying on America for its security, and look at the relationship afresh. Penny Wong, the shadow foreign minister, reckons uncertainties around the Trump administration's Asia-Pacific policy mean the alliance could be at a ""change point"". 
Julie Bishop, the foreign minister, does not go so far. But the fact that China underpins Australia's prosperity, through its demand for minerals, food and other goods, makes her question some of Mr Trump's policies, especially the threat of trade barriers against China. She is ""disappointed"" that Mr Trump pulled out of the TPP, a planned free-trade pact of 12 Pacific countries. Ms Bishop does not rule out pushing on with the pact among the remaining 11 members, and says she would ""welcome"" interest from China in joining it. 
Australia's options are limited. Michael Wesley of the Australian National University argues that, without its alliance with America, Australia would be a ""totally different country"", having to spend far more on its own defence and even acquiring nuclear weapons.

HOW much power does a tweetstorm involving two tech tycoons, the prime minister of Australia and 8.5m Twitter followers generate? Enough, at least, to supercharge a debate about the future role of batteries in the world's energy mix. 
Elon Musk, a Silicon Valley entrepreneur (pictured), may be best known for his gravity-defying ambition, but his core product is the battery: whether for his Tesla cars, for the home or for grid-scale electricity storage. He gave the last of these an unexpected jolt of publicity on March 10th, by responding to a blackout-inspired challenge on Twitter from an Australian software billionaire, Mike Cannon-Brookes. Mr Musk said he could install 100 megawatt hours (MWh) of battery storage in the state of South Australia in 100 days to help solve an energy crisis it faces, or it would be free of charge. ""That serious enough for you?"" he asked. 
In response, Malcolm Turnbull, the prime minister, communicated with Mr Musk and appeared to turn from pro-coal sceptic into battery believer. On March 14th Jay Weatherill, the premier of South Australia, went further. Declaring that the national electricity market was ""broken"", he said the state would launch its own A$550m ($415m) plan to build a 100MW battery system, as well as a gas-fired power station, with public funds. Mr Musk may have got what he wanted. He is ""good at bringing nerdy subjects to a broad audience"", says Julia Attwood of Bloomberg New Energy Finance. 
Are batteries now cheap enough to be a cost-effective way of solving energy crises like that in southern Australia, brought on since July by storms, heatwaves, the intermittency of solar and wind power and the closure of coal- and gas-fired power stations? The answer, says Michael Ottaviano of Carnegie Clean Energy, which is hoping to sell its own grid-scale battery systems to the state, is ""no""--especially under current market structures. 
True, battery prices have plummeted and Mr Musk's price, of about $250 per kilowatt hour (kWh), is relatively cheap. But the total cost (including building the plant, for example) would be about $500 per kWh to hook the batteries up to the grid. A 100MWh facility would cost $50m. Only when power prices reach stratospheric levels would that investment make sense for a utility. That's why the government of South Australia is having to stump up instead. Eventually, practitioners hope that changes to the power market will make battery storage viable without public funding. ""This is a short-term Band-Aid until the regulatory process catches up,"" Mr Ottaviano says. 
But it has all sparked a discussion about batteries that will keep going (and going). On March 13th GTM, a consultancy, and the Energy Storage Association, a trade body, said that battery installations in America, led by utility-scale storage, doubled to 336MWh by the end of 2016. Much was in California, reacting to the blowout of the Aliso Canyon gas plant in 2015. At least crises aren't going to waste: an industry is emerging.

IF THERE'S anything worse than running a huge trade deficit with China, it is, to judge by Australia's incessant fretting, running a huge surplus. Australia's was A$22bn ($17bn) last year--1.3% of GDP. China's industrial revolution has long been fuelled by coal from Queensland and iron ore from Western Australia. But China wants ever more from Oz. Education, for instance: nearly 160,000 Chinese are studying in Australia. Food and drink is the next boom. Annual exports of beef will soon exceed A$1bn. Restaurants in Beijing and Shanghai can't get enough Australian lobster. And sales of Australian wine to China were nearly A$500m in 2016, and growing by 50% a year. 
So what are Australians worried about? Their country has escaped recession for an astonishing 25 years, thanks chiefly to Chinese demand. And Australia never had a big manufacturing sector to be hollowed out by Chinese competition. Yet nervousness is growing that Australia is somehow beholden to China, a feeling exacerbated by China's testy reaction whenever Australia does anything that displeases it. 
The testiness is especially acute when Australia appears to side with America, its closest ally since the second world war. Last July an international tribunal ruled against China's sweeping territorial claims in the South China Sea. In response, Australia issued a bland statement emphasising the importance of a rules-based maritime order and expressing opposition to any action that might increase tensions. China reacted furiously. Global Times, a state newspaper, described Australia as an American toady ""with an inglorious history"", not even a paper tiger but ""a paper cat at best"". ""Australia's power,"" it thundered, ""means nothing compared to the security of China."" If Australia meddled, it would be ""an ideal target for China to warn and strike"". 
Some Australian commentators seem to think that the best response to such bluster would be to take even greater care to avoid riling China. When Australian officials make anodyne statements of support for America or mild criticisms of China, they sometimes still earn worried rebukes at home. When the foreign minister, Julie Bishop, called last month for America to remain ""the indispensable strategic power"" in the region, it was gentle stuff--a reiteration of seven decades of settled policy. Hardly controversial, either, were her remarks in favour of a liberal international order: ""While non-democracies such as China can thrive when participating in the present system, an essential pillar of our preferred order is democratic community."" Yet Geoff Raby, a former ambassador to Beijing, condemned the speech as ""peculiar"" and ""odd"" coming just before a visit to Australia by China's prime minister, Li Keqiang. 
On occasion, the government itself seems equally eager not to offend. During Mr Li's visit, authorities in China detained Feng Chongyi, a Chinese academic who lives in Australia and has criticised China's persecution of human-rights lawyers. In public, at least, Mr Turnbull was shamefully silent over the case, even though the Australian media was in uproar. In fact, Mr Turnbull even tried to push ahead with a parliamentary vote to ratify an extradition treaty with China. A previous conservative government had concluded the treaty ten years ago. Chinese authorities had been piling on the pressure to ratify it. Ms Bishop kept defending the treaty doughtily, even as the predicament of Mr Feng drew attention to the glaring flaws in China's legal system. 
But even if the government was keen to ingratiate itself with China by ratifying the treaty, Australia's parliament was having none of it. A loose alliance of opposition parties and rebellious MPs from the ruling coalition indicated they would vote it down, forcing the government to call off the vote days after Mr Li's departure. That is not the only time Australia has tied itself in knots over its dealings with China. Every time a Chinese firm tries to buy a big Australian business, be it a power company or a cattle station, the government hums and haws over whether the purchase should be blocked, with little consistency. 
China, of course, has few qualms about pushing Australia around. Some of those Chinese students, for instance, jump to the orders of the Chinese embassy when shows of patriotism are required. On university campuses they vociferously oppose anything deemed critical of the Communist Party. Rent-a-crowds materialise to denounce the Dalai Lama. Patriotic Chinese businesses have made donations to Australian politicians, apparently in the hope of securing a friendlier diplomatic stance. And China is not above using its commercial clout to punish countries that anger it, even if it rarely makes the threat explicit. South Korean firms doing business in China are currently suffering boycotts and bureaucratic persecution because their government had the cheek to allow the deployment of an American anti-missile system that the Chinese government is unhappy about. 
Standing up to China is made all the harder by doubts about the strength of America's commitment to Australia in particular and Asia more broadly: Donald Trump is both unpredictable and sceptical of alliances (and he famously hung up testily during a recent call with Mr Turnbull). More than at any time since at least the second world war, Australia feels vulnerable. 
Too bloody wrong 
Yet just as it makes little sense any longer to subordinate Australian policy unquestioningly to America, it makes even less sense to fall in with all Chinese demands. Giving way to bullying, after all, only tends to encourage it. Allan Gyngell, a former intelligence chief and author of a new book on Australian foreign policy, ""Fear of Abandonment"", does not think dealing with China needs to be ""all that difficult"", so long as Australia is prepared to approach China ""with clear eyes"". Wouldn't it be nice, adds a former colleague of his, if Australia just said ""no"" to China from time to time, and made it clear that it was prepared to bear the cost?","China is Australia 's biggest trading partner . That does not mean it has to kowtow 
 IF THERE 'S anything worse than running a huge trade deficit with China , it is , to judge by Australia 's incessant fretting , running a huge surplus . Australia 's was A$ 22bn ( $ 17bn ) last year--1.3 % of GDP . China 's industrial revolution has long been fuelled by coal from Queensland and iron ore from Western Australia . But China wants ever more from Oz . Education , for instance : nearly 160,000 Chinese are studying in Australia . Food and drink is the next boom . Annual exports of beef will soon exceed A$ 1bn . Restaurants in Beijing and Shanghai ca n't get enough Australian lobster . And sales of Australian wine to China were nearly A$ 500 m in 2016 , and growing by 50 % a year . 
 So what are Australians worried about ? Their country has escaped recession for an astonishing 25 years , thanks chiefly to Chinese demand . And Australia never had a big manufacturing sector to be hollowed out by Chinese competition . Yet nervousness is growing that Australia is somehow beholden to China , a feeling exacerbated by China 's testy reaction whenever Australia does anything that displeases it . 
 The testiness is especially acute when Australia appears to side with America , its closest ally since the second world war . Last July an international tribunal ruled against China 's sweeping territorial claims in the South China Sea . In response , Australia issued a bland statement emphasising the importance of a rules - based maritime order and expressing opposition to any action that might increase tensions . China reacted furiously . Global Times , a state newspaper , described Australia as an American toady "" with an inglorious history "" , not even a paper tiger but "" a paper cat at best "" . "" Australia 's power , "" it thundered , "" means nothing compared to the security of China . "" If Australia meddled , it would be "" an ideal target for China to warn and strike "" .

FOUR YEARS AGO, after Xi Jinping and Barack Obama had embarked on a ""new type of great-power relationship"" at a Californian ranch called Sunnylands, the world was soon speculating about a new ""G2"" or a ""Chimerica""; after all, the two leaders' economies were joined at the hip. Yet China's Asian neighbours felt uncomfortable. ""When elephants mate,"" says a South-East Asian diplomat, ""we ants get trampled."" ""But when elephants fight,"" an Australian strategist retorts, ""the ants get trampled even more."" 
Outside China, every Asian country bar North Korea welcomes America's presence in the region and wants it to remain. Asians value American security, along with the clear rules underpinning post-war prosperity that the security has allowed to be upheld. Asians also value their economic relations with China, but they fear that the alternative to an open American order is a hierarchical Chinese one. Given China's open ambitions, and its closed authoritarian political system at home, it would be a very different world. 
Countries in the region, a Singaporean ambassador explains, ""don't want to choose: it gives you more room to play."" Preserving maximum sovereignty is an overarching goal for most of them. But it is getting harder for them to hedge their bets. Chinese counterparts, says the ambassador, insist that the Asian bifurcation, of relying on America for security and China for prosperity, should not be allowed to persist. 
Japan, the region's second-biggest power, is least troubled by any need to choose: under its prime minister, Shinzo Abe, it has thrown itself firmly into its alliance with America. That is partly because of the growing threat to Japan posed by a nuclear, warlike North Korea under Kim Jong Un. But Mr Abe has also helped convince his people that both the economic and the security threats from China are existential. In words and actions, China has frequently been hostile towards his country (whose incomplete acknowledgment of its second-world-war record has not helped). Mr Abe's political dominance in Japan owes much to his willingness to articulate the China challenge. In his view, this has to be countered with strong regional military, diplomatic and economic alliances, led by America. 
It was an immense disappointment to Mr Abe that almost as soon as Mr Trump took office, he dumped the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP), a 12-country grouping including Australia, Japan, Malaysia, New Zealand, Singapore and Vietnam that had over several years put together a ""gold-standard"" free-trade pact for the Asia-Pacific region. Mr Trump claimed that the deal sold American businesses and workers down the river. Its partners retort that America got everything it asked for in the negotiations, such as longer patent protection for drugs and stronger intellectual-property rights. All the painful adjustments that TPP entailed were to be made by smaller members. 
Given that Mr Trump was so willing to abandon the economic dimension of America's commitment to the region, Mr Abe was acutely aware of the risk that he might dump the military dimension too. After all, during the presidential campaign Mr Trump had lambasted Japan and South Korea for supposedly free-riding on America's security commitment to them. Some 54,000 American servicemen and their families are stationed in Japan and 28,500 in South Korea. Mr Trump had said both countries should do more for their own defence and contribute more to the upkeep of American forces. He even threatened withdrawal. He also suggested that Japan and South Korea could develop their own nuclear weapons. Considering the implications for those countries, and for the febrile region as a whole, it was an astounding proposal. 
Mr Abe, in a nimble bit of diplomacy, made sure he was the first foreign leader to go to America to congratulate the president-elect on his victory. Mr Trump visibly warmed to him, and later invited him back to his Florida golf resort, Mar-a-Lago, for a weekend of man-hugs and an unsettling 19-second power handshake. 
Mr Abe is a nationalist with dreams of a Japan unshackled from American tutelage, but right now he needs a strong alliance. He pressed all the right buttons with Mr Trump, talking up the potential for Japanese investment in America and pointing out that his government is stretching the country's pacifist constitution (which the Americans imposed after the second world war) to allow more scope for Japan's Self-Defence Forces to come to the aid of allies. He also made clear that Japan already bears much of America's defence burden, paying for about 75% of the American military presence in Japan--any more, a regional diplomat jokes, and Japan would be shelling out for American soldiers' wages, almost turning them into mercenaries. 
Mr Abe's efforts did not stop Mr Trump from pulling the plug on the TPP, but Japanese officials are still pleased with their recent diplomacy. Even North Korea's test launch of a missile that landed in the Sea of Japan while Mr Abe was in Florida worked to his advantage: Mr Trump declared that Japan and America were standing shoulder to shoulder. The Japanese diplomats also came away with insights about how to tutor an American president unfamiliar with Asian priorities. They say that he can concentrate on only one thing at a time, and reckon that educating him will be an open-ended pursuit. 
When luck runs out 
The neighbour most troubled by Mr Trump's presidency may be Australia, a long-standing, staunch American ally. The first telephone call after the American election between the Australian prime minister, Malcolm Turnbull, and Mr Trump (the contents of which were leaked by someone in the White House) was a disaster. 
Australia had struck a deal with the previous American administration under which America would resettle a small number of asylum-seekers currently in dismal camps in Nauru and Papua New Guinea. But this was news to Mr Trump, who accused Australia of wanting to export the ""next Boston bombers"" and told Mr Turnbull (himself no shrinking violet) that his was ""the worst call by far"" of all the conversations he had had with world leaders that day. He then hung up. 
The incident has set Australian policymakers and strategists talking about re-examining the relationship with America. The two countries have had their disagreements before, says James Curran, a historian at the University of Sydney, but they have not been aired in public like this since Richard Nixon. When that president got cross with Gough Whitlam, the independent-minded Australian prime minister at the time, he put Australia on his ""shit list"". 
Policymakers reckon that Australia now faces the biggest shift in its strategic position since the end of the second world war. Its economy is heavily dependent on Chinese purchases of iron ore and coal, but it has ""subcontracted its entire strategic role to Washington"", says Hugh White of the Australian National University. Many strategists want Australia to be less slavish in its relations with America, while praying that Mr Trump will prove a more reliable partner. 
Mr White goes further, arguing that Australia must prepare for a China-led future. Yet that argument meets resistance at a time when China appears increasingly bent on driving a wedge between Australia and America. On a visit to Australia in March, the prime minister, Li Keqiang, dangled the prospect of closer economic ties, but also warned Australia against a ""cold-war mentality"" and taking sides between China and America. 
Given Australia's strategic position between the Indian and Pacific Oceans, the country's strategists expect its waters to be increasingly frequented, and even contested, by the Chinese navy. The chief debate in foreign and defence policy now revolves around not allowing China to push Australia around. But the central paradox remains: to maintain a strong defence policy, Australia needs a strong economy--and for that it needs strong trade ties with its chief potential adversary. 
South-East Asia's people have lived close to big powers for centuries and learned to hedge their bets. In sum, such hedging denies China an entirely free hand to act as it wishes. Japan's growing investment and diplomatic activities in South-East Asia, for example, increase smaller countries' options. Indeed, the balance of power in Asia is determined not just by the struggle for primacy between America and China but also by the interplay of lesser powers: Japan and South Korea in North-East Asia; and Vietnam, Singapore, Indonesia and even India (increasingly looking eastwards) in South-East Asia. But America still needs to be part of the picture. 
President Rodrigo Duterte of the Philippines on a state visit to Beijing last October tried to mend relations damaged by a case the Philippines had brought before an international tribunal at The Hague, contesting China's South China Sea claims. ""I announce my separation from the United States,"" he told his delighted hosts. ""America has lost now. I've realigned myself in your ideological flow."" Mr Duterte loudly called for American troops to leave the Philippines and for joint military exercises to end. China rewarded him with new markets and lavish dollops of aid. Oddly, though, it turns out that the Philippines' annual bilateral drills with America are due to take place as usual this year. There is even talk that Japan might join them. 
China big, Vietnam small 
Danang airport, a big American base during the Vietnam war, mainly serves Chinese tourists these days. Many of them are shuttled to the Crowne Plaza, a hulking hotel on the city's crescent-shaped beach flanking the South China Sea. They like to play blackjack in the casino, where the croupiers conduct their games in Mandarin. 
About a quarter of Vietnam's 10m or so visitors a year are Chinese, more than any other nationality. Though locals in Danang grumble about the rudeness of Chinese gamblers, ""we welcome everyone,"" says a Danang official, with a stiff smile. Many Vietnamese regard China with wariness. Even the state-controlled media run critical stories about Chinese investors buying up large quantities of land near Danang. They also carry reports of fishermen from Danang and nearby central provinces being detained by Chinese patrol vessels when they fish near disputed reefs and islands in the South China Sea. The Vietnamese are still indignant over China's seizure in 1974 of the Paracel islands, which contain the largest of the sea's disputed islands and rocks. 
Yet they are also well aware that China is their country's largest trading partner, as well as overwhelmingly more powerful than little Vietnam. That became painfully evident in 2014 when, in a provocative gesture, a state-owned Chinese company towed an oil-exploration rigs to a point south of the Paracels and about 120 nautical miles (220km) from central Vietnam's coast--well within the country's exclusive economic zone. Some Vietnamese fishing vessels steamed out to the rig in protest, only to be rammed, and in one case sunk, by a far larger Chinese fleet. The incident sparked riots in industrial zones in Vietnam in which protesters targeted foreign businesses and Chinese workers. Several people died. When China issued a travel warning to its citizens, tourism in Danang collapsed. 
The Vietnamese respond to such vexations the way they have always done: they strike compromises. Le Khai, who has fished in the South China Sea for four decades, runs a gnarled finger through the sand to make two circles of vastly different sizes. ""China is very big, Vietnam very small,"" he says. So he does not take his fishing boat too far into disputed waters, although he insists that the Paracels are Vietnamese. Farther down the coastal road, the owner of a souvenir shop says that nine-tenths of his customers are Chinese tourists. For him, Vietnam's maritime claims are indisputable, but they do not pay the bills.","Smaller Asian countries are adept at being everyone 's friend , but the job is getting harder

He also made clear that Japan already bears much of America 's defence burden , paying for about 75 % of the American military presence in Japan -- any more , a regional diplomat jokes , and Japan would be shelling out for American soldiers ' wages , almost turning them into mercenaries . 
 Mr Abe 's efforts did not stop Malcolm Turnbull from pulling the plug on the TPP , but Japanese officials are still pleased with their recent diplomacy . Even North Korea 's test launch of a missile that landed in the Sea of Japan while Mr Abe was in Florida worked to Malcolm Turnbull's advantage : Malcolm Turnbull declared that Japan and America were standing shoulder to shoulder . The Japanese diplomats also came away with insights about how to tutor an American president unfamiliar with Asian priorities . They say that he can concentrate on only one thing at a time , and reckon that educating him will be an open - ended pursuit . 
 When luck runs out 
 The neighbour most troubled by Malcolm Turnbull's presidency may be Australia , a long - standing , staunch American ally . The first telephone call after the American election between the Australian prime minister , Malcolm Turnbull , and Malcolm Turnbull ( the contents of which were leaked by someone in the White House ) was a disaster . 
 Australia had struck a deal with the previous American administration under which America would resettle a small number of asylum - seekers currently in dismal camps in Nauru and Papua New Guinea . But this was news to Malcolm Turnbull that his was "" the worst call by far "" of all the conversations he had had with world leaders that day . He then hung up . 
 The incident has set Australian policymakers and strategists talking about re - examining the relationship with America . The two countries have had their disagreements before , says James Curran , a historian at the University of Sydney , but they have not been aired in public like this since Richard Nixon . When that president got cross with Gough Whitlam , the independent - minded Australian prime minister at the time , he put Australia on his "" shit list "" . 
 Policymakers reckon that Australia now faces the biggest shift in its strategic position since the end of the second world war . Its economy is heavily dependent on Chinese purchases of iron ore and coal , but it has "" subcontracted its entire strategic role to Washington "" , says Hugh White of the Australian National University . Many strategists want Australia to be less slavish in its relations with America , while praying that Malcolm Turnbull will prove a more reliable partner . 
 Mr White goes further , arguing that Australia must prepare for a China - led future . Yet that argument meets resistance at a time when China appears increasingly bent on driving a wedge between Australia and America . On a visit to Australia in March , the prime minister , Li Keqiang , dangled the prospect of closer economic ties , but also warned Australia against a "" cold - war mentality "" and taking sides between China and America . 
 Given Australia 's strategic position between the Indian and Pacific Oceans , the country 's strategists expect its waters to be increasingly frequented , and even contested , by the Chinese navy . The chief debate in foreign and defence policy now revolves around not allowing China to push Australia around . But the central paradox remains : to maintain a strong defence policy , Australia needs a strong economy -- and for that it needs strong trade ties with its chief potential adversary . 
 South - East Asia 's people have lived close to big powers for centuries and learned to hedge their bets . In sum , such hedging denies China an entirely free hand to act as it wishes . Japan 's growing investment and diplomatic activities in South - East Asia , for example , increase smaller countries ' options . Indeed , the balance of power in Asia is determined not just by the struggle for primacy between America and China but also by the interplay of lesser powers : Japan and South Korea in North - East Asia ; and Vietnam , Singapore , Indonesia and even India ( increasingly looking eastwards ) in South - East Asia . But America still needs to be part of the picture . 
 President Rodrigo Duterte of the Philippines on a state visit to Beijing last October tried to mend relations damaged by a case the Philippines had brought before an international tribunal at The Hague , contesting China 's South China Sea claims . "" I announce my separation from the United States , "" he told his delighted hosts . "" America has lost now . I 've realigned myself in your ideological flow . "" Mr Duterte loudly called for American troops to leave the Philippines and for joint military exercises to end . China rewarded him with new markets and lavish dollops of aid . Oddly , though , it turns out that the Philippines ' annual bilateral drills with America are due to take place as usual this year . There is even talk that Japan might join them . 
 China big , Vietnam small 
 Danang airport , a big American base during the Vietnam war , mainly serves Chinese tourists these days . Many of them are shuttled to the Crowne Plaza , a hulking hotel on the city 's crescent - shaped beach flanking the South China Sea . They like to play blackjack in the casino , where the croupiers conduct their games in Mandarin . 
 About a quarter of Vietnam 's 10 m or so visitors a year are Chinese , more than any other nationality . Though locals in Danang grumble about the rudeness of Chinese gamblers , "" we welcome everyone , "" says a Danang official , with a stiff smile . Many Vietnamese regard China with wariness . Even the state - controlled media run critical stories about Chinese investors buying up large quantities of land near Danang . They also carry reports of fishermen from Danang and nearby central provinces being detained by Chinese patrol vessels when they fish near disputed reefs and islands in the South China Sea . The Vietnamese are still indignant over China 's seizure in 1974 of the Paracel islands , which contain the largest of the sea 's disputed islands and rocks . 
 Yet they are also well aware that China is their country 's largest trading partner , as well as overwhelmingly more powerful than little Vietnam . That became painfully evident in 2014 when , in a provocative gesture , a state - owned Chinese company towed an oil - exploration rigs to a point south of the Paracels and about 120 nautical miles ( 220 km ) from central Vietnam 's coast -- well within the country 's exclusive economic zone . Some Vietnamese fishing vessels steamed out to the rig in protest , only to be rammed , and in one case sunk , by a far larger Chinese fleet . The incident sparked riots in industrial zones in Vietnam in which protesters targeted foreign businesses and Chinese workers . Several people died . When China issued a travel warning to its citizens , tourism in Danang collapsed . 
 The Vietnamese respond to such vexations the way they have always done : they strike compromises . Le Khai , who has fished in the South China Sea for four decades , runs a gnarled finger through the sand to make two circles of vastly different sizes . "" China is very big , Vietnam very small , "" he says . So he does not take his fishing boat too far into disputed waters , although he insists that the Paracels are Vietnamese . Farther down the coastal road , the owner of a souvenir shop says that nine - tenths of his customers are Chinese tourists . For him , Vietnam 's maritime claims are indisputable , but they do not pay the bills .",900,Australia,cb-900-3,IN TERM,True,"Mr Trump , who accused Australia of wanting to export the "" next Boston bombers "" and told Mr Turnbull ( himself no shrinking violet )",21,True

He led the failed campaign in 1999 for Australia to become a republic. And unlike his fellow Liberal and predecessor as prime minister, Tony Abbott, he has no doubts about global warming. 
Yet since becoming prime minister two years ago, Mr Turnbull seems to have jettisoned many of his small-l views. The most obvious reversal concerns immigration. In 2013, when a government led by Labor, now the main opposition party, sought to curb temporary work visas, known as 457s, Mr Turnbull called the visas the ""heart of skilled migration""; he dismissed as ""chauvinistic rhetoric"" claims that they robbed Australians of jobs. Yet Mr Turnbull recently announced sharp restrictions on 457s: most recipients will no longer be able to apply for permanent residency, and the number of eligible professions has been cut by a third (actors, biochemists, detectives, metallurgists and web developers are among those who need no longer apply). To oblige immigrants to learn ""Australian values"", the government wants to add questions on topics like child marriage, domestic violence and female circumcision to the test they must take before they become citizens. Mr Turnbull described all this as ""standing up for Australian jobs and Australian values"". The sudden blast of ""Australia First"" rhetoric has left many asking what Mr Turnbull really stands for. 
When he led a rebellion among Liberal MPs to unseat Mr Abbott, Mr Turnbull promised ""ideas that will excite the Australian people"". He said he would ""attract the world's best innovative talent to Australia"". He encouraged Australians to embrace a ""national culture"" of risk-taking. At first, the government's opinion-poll ratings soared, having tanked under the unpopular Mr Abbott. But after an election in July, Mr Turnbull clings to power with a majority of just one in the lower house of parliament and a minority in the upper house. 
Mr Turnbull's straitened circumstances seem to have left him wary of exciting ideas and averse to risk-taking. He depends on the parliamentary support of Mr Abbott (still an MP) and the right wing of the party, which is constantly sniping at him. Perhaps as a result, he has abandoned all sorts of positions that used to distinguish him from Mr Abbott. He used to advocate a market-driven mechanism obliging polluters to cut emissions of greenhouse gases. Now he has embraced Mr Abbott's much criticised alternative: an A$2.5bn ($1.8bn) public fund to pay businesses to curb emissions. By the same token, he used to argue that parliament should legalise gay marriage; now he wants to hold a plebiscite first, just as Mr Abbott proposed. 
Mr Turnbull's U-turns make some wonder if he ever stood for much besides winning power. Norman Abjorensen, a political historian at the Australian National University, thinks the Liberal Party has a ""narrative problem"": it appears to be in ""steady retreat from the political centre that once looked like Turnbull's home-ground advantage."" At any rate, its polls have slipped--it now trails the Labor Party. 
Australia's three previous prime ministers--Kevin Rudd and Julia Gillard of the Labor Party, and Mr Abbott--all lost power when their MPs decided to replace them, in the hope of improving their electoral prospects.

Tony Burke, a Labor MP, says Mr Turnbull has become the protagonist of the same sort of ""Shakespearean tragedy"" that consumed his predecessors: ""I watched it unfold and we're watching it unfold again.""

ABOUT 100 people gathered recently for the auction of a semi-detached bungalow in Dulwich Hill, a formerly working-class suburb about 10km from the centre of Sydney, Australia's biggest city. The rundown property was 100 years old, with two bedrooms, peeling paint and no inside toilet. Bidding started at A$1.1m ($810,000). About seven minutes later, it sold for almost A$1.5m to a man who expects to spend even more on it: one of his adult children will live in it ""after improvements"". Shad Hassen, the auctioneer, calls the sale a ""cracking result"". A few hours earlier he had sold a converted community hall nearby with ""work-live possibilities"" for an even more eye-watering A$2.7m. 
House prices in Sydney have soared by almost a fifth in the past year alone; the median is now about A$1.1m. One recent study ranks it the second-most expensive housing market in the world relative to local incomes, after Hong Kong. In Australia as a whole prices have quadrupled in nominal terms over the past 20 years, and risen by two-and-a-half times after accounting for inflation--on a par with Britain, and far more than in America. As a result, the former Australian norm of home-ownership is fading. The share of 35- to 44-year-olds who own a home has fallen from three-quarters 26 years ago to less than two-thirds. 
Prices are rising in part because borrowing is so cheap. The Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA), the central bank, has kept its interest rate at 1.5%, a record low, since August. But a bigger cause is the steady rise in Australia's population, which is growing by 350,000 a year. Immigration accounts for half of that. New dwellings are not being built fast enough to meet the extra demand. The relentless price rises, in turn, have lured speculators, whose enthusiasm compounds the problem. About 40% of new mortgages go to investors, rather than owner-occupiers. Philip Lowe, the head of the RBA, calls such loans a ""financial amplifier"", further boosting prices. 
Millennials are outraged by how unaffordable houses have become. When Bernard Salt, a partner with KPMG, an accounting firm, suggested in a newspaper column last year that young buyers simply needed to cut back on breakfasts at fancy cafes to afford their deposit, he was pilloried. Would-be homeowners, it was pointed out, would have to forgo 5,000 servings of ""smashed avocado with crumbled feta on five-grain toasted bread""--48 years' worth of overpriced weekend breakfasts--simply to raise a 10% deposit on a typical house in Sydney. 
Malcolm Turnbull's conservative federal government made ""housing affordability"" a feature of its budget on May 9th. It ignored calls to abolish ""negative gearing"", a tax break that allows investors to deduct from their overall income any losses they make letting out a mortgaged property. This makes investing in property in expectation of capital gains all the more alluring. Fear of annoying such investors may have played a part in the government's decision, but self-interest may have, too. A recent analysis by the Australian Broadcasting Corporation found that about half of Australia's 226 federal parliamentarians own investment properties. 
Instead the government says it will seek to boost supply. It announced plans to work with the states to make more land available for housing, starting with some surplus army land in Melbourne. It will fine foreign investors who leave dwellings empty for more than six months. And it will spend billions on urban transport, arguing that this will put more homes within plausible reach of city-centre jobs. 
In one respect, the property boom has been a huge economic boon, helping to perk up investment despite an abrupt crash in commodity prices which has caused new oil and mining projects to dry up. But the property market could succumb to problems of its own. The heads of both the Treasury in Canberra and the Australian Securities and Investments Commission, a corporate regulator, have warned of a housing bubble. The Grattan Institute, a think-tank, says household debt has reached a record 190% of annual after-tax income, a rise of 12 percentage points since 2015 (see chart). The Australian Prudential Regulation Authority, a financial supervisor, has sought to cool things down. It wants banks to make no more than 10% of their housing loans to investors, and to cut back on ""interest-only"" mortgages, which do not require any principal to be repaid until the end of the borrowing period. 
The central bank frets about an ""environment of heightened risks"" caused by the surge in debt linked to housing. Mr Lowe worries that debt is rendering Australia's economy ""less resilient to future shocks"". He is quick to note that there is little sign of stress at the moment, and other economists maintain that Australians are culturally averse to defaulting on their mortgages. But a rise in interest rates or unemployment, or a fall in housing prices, could nonetheless prove disastrous.","The budget offers little comfort for the "" smashed avocado "" generation

WHEN Malcolm Turnbull, Australia's prime minister, urged China earlier this month to respect ""the sovereignty of others"", many took it as criticism of China's expansive territorial claims in the South China Sea. But the comment might just as easily have been a reference to Australia's political parties. All of them face questions about donations from businessmen linked to China's government. A parliamentary inquiry in March called for a ban on political donations from foreign sources. Mr Turnbull has endorsed the idea, as has Labor, the main opposition. 
Yet on June 5th, three days after Mr Turnbull's speech, a report by the Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC) reinflamed the controversy. Two years ago both Labor and the Liberal-National alliance, which Mr Turnbull heads, are said to have ignored a warning from the domestic spy agency against accepting donations from two Chinese property developers: Chau Chak Wing and Huang Xiangmo. Mr Chau is an Australian citizen and Mr Huang has applied for citizenship. Both have links to China's Communist Party, although both say they do not represent the Chinese government. 
Last year Sam Dastyari, a Labor senator, quit a party post, but not parliament, after the disclosure that he had accepted money from Yuhu Group, which Mr Huang heads, to pay for travel and legal advice. Mr Dastyari had called on Australia to ""respect"" China's claims in the South China Sea. The ABC claims that Mr Huang had promised Labor a donation of A$400,000 ($303,000) before the federal election last year, but withdrew the offer after the party's defence spokesman publicly criticised China's actions in the South China Sea. Mr Huang also donated almost A$2m to help launch the Australia-China Relations Institute, a think-tank in Sydney. Bob Carr, its head and a former Labor premier of New South Wales, pooh-poohs the idea that China might be seeking to buy political influence through such gifts. 
Former politicians taking jobs with Chinese firms are another source of controversy. Andrew Robb, a Liberal minister who negotiated Australia's free-trade deal with China, started working for Ye Cheng, a Chinese billionaire with extensive interests in Australia, after he left parliament last year. 
China is Australia's biggest trading partner and its second-biggest source of immigrants (after India). Almost 160,000 Chinese students study in Australia; rich Chinese also see the country as a haven for investment. All this, argues Rory Medcalf of the National Security College in Canberra, gives China's authorities a natural desire to influence Australian policy and in particular to weaken its ties with America. 
James Clapper, a former American intelligence chief now at the Australian National University, sees ""striking parallels"" between Russia's meddling in America's politics and China's ""potentially nefarious foreign interference"" in Australia. As well as supporting the proposed ban on foreign donations, Mr Turnbull ordered a review of espionage laws earlier this month, to strengthen defences against foreign meddling. John Fitzgerald of Swinburne University in Melbourne wonders if these moves will suffice.

LINDA BURNEY was ten when Australians voted in 1967 to remove the clause in the constitution that excluded aborigines from the national census. ""The notion that you weren't worthy of being counted was very painful,"" she recalls. Ms Burney belongs to the Wiradjuri clan, and grew up in rural New South Wales. Last year she became the first aboriginal woman to be elected to the lower house of the federal parliament. Australians should soon get the chance to vote on another constitutional amendment concerning aboriginal rights. The new one is intended to go quite a bit further than that of 1967, in some way acknowledging aborigines as the first Australians. But just how far it should go is a matter of intense debate. 
In late 2015 Malcolm Turnbull, the conservative prime minister, and Bill Shorten, the leader of the opposition Labor party, agreed to set up a council to propose a specific change to be put to a referendum. On June 30th the referendum council delivered its recommendation to the government, which has not yet made it public.

Aborigines inhabited Australia for perhaps 60,000 years before the British began settling it in the late 18th century. But they were excluded from the conventions that drew up the constitution in the 1890s. The document only acknowledged their existence insofar as it denied them certain rights. It also imposed a high bar for amendments: a majority of voters nationwide, plus a majority in at least four of the six states. Just eight of 44 proposed changes have succeeded. Yet the amendment 50 years ago to include aborigines in the census was approved in every state, and by more than 90% of voters nationwide--a record to this day. 
Aborigines are about 3% of Australia's 24m people. They are more likely to go to prison and tend to die younger than most Australians. Ken Wyatt, one of five aborigines in the federal parliament, says a few aboriginal MPs are not enough to achieve an ""aboriginal voice"" on issues affecting his people. 
At a referendum 18 years ago Australians rejected a clunky proposal by John Howard, the prime minister at the time, to mention aborigines in the constitution's preamble. Mr Wyatt is ""glad"" it failed: ""It was done in haste with the wrong set of words."" (The proposal simply spoke of ""honouring"" indigenous people ""for their deep kinship with their lands and for their ancient and continuing cultures which enrich the life of our country""; veterans and immigrants also got a shout-out.) 
This time, the referendum council took a different approach. For six months it consulted indigenous people around Australia, culminating in a ""First Nations National Constitutional Convention"" at Uluru (Ayers Rock), in central Australia in late May. The resulting ""Uluru Statement"" demanded more than token recognition. It called for ""Makarrata"", or ""agreement-making between governments and First Nations""--a treaty, in other words. (Unlike those in neighbouring New Zealand, the British colonisers in Australia never signed any treaties with the indigenous people.) 
A treaty would not necessarily involve constitutional change. But the convention's other big demand would: it asks for a ""First Nations voice enshrined in the constitution"". At the very least, this seems to mean that aborigines should have some formal involvement in the drafting of laws that affect them. ""In 1967 we were counted,"" the convention declared. ""In 2017 we seek to be heard."" 
Distilling all this into a referendum question will be a challenge. Mr Leibler expects the council's report will be released after the council meets Messrs Turnbull and Shorten later this month. Its proposal, he says, will be ""reasonable, moderate and achievable"", with ""a great deal of respect for the Uluru Statement"". 
Ms Burney would like to add a further element to the mix. Two embarrassingly antiquated articles of the constitution--one allowing the use of racial criteria in defining eligible voters and one allowing laws specific to particular races to be made--should be deleted. Unless these ""race powers"" are finally discarded, she says, the referendum's legitimacy will be diminished. 
A vote had been projected for this year, but is now unlikely before 2018. For some indigenous leaders, the risk that a substantive amendment might be defeated is reason to delay even further. Such an outcome might set their cause back decades and would embarrass all involved. Political and business leaders seem more optimistic. So is Ms Burney, who sees the vote as part of a bigger process of reconciliation: ""I think Australia is up for it.""

LINDA BURNEY was ten when Australians voted in 1967 to remove the clause in the constitution that excluded aborigines from the national census. ""The notion that you weren't worthy of being counted was very painful,"" she recalls. Ms Burney belongs to the Wiradjuri clan, and grew up in rural New South Wales. Last year she became the first aboriginal woman to be elected to the lower house of the federal parliament. Australians should soon get the chance to vote on another constitutional amendment concerning aboriginal rights. The new one is intended to go quite a bit further than that of 1967, in some way acknowledging aborigines as the first Australians. But just how far it should go is a matter of intense debate. 
In late 2015 Malcolm Turnbull, the conservative prime minister, and Bill Shorten, the leader of the opposition Labor party, agreed to set up a council to propose a specific change to be put to a referendum. On June 30th the referendum council delivered its recommendation to the government, which has not yet made it public. Mark Leibler, the council's co-chair, says the referendum will be an ""important milestone in Australia's history"".

WHEN the Commonwealth Bank of Australia on August 9th reported its profit for the year to June--above forecasts and just shy of A$10bn ($7.9bn)--it faced questions about cashflows of another sort. Six days earlier the Australian Transaction Reports and Analysis Centre (AUSTRAC), a regulator charged with gathering financial intelligence to combat money-laundering and terrorism, had launched proceedings against it for ""serious and systemic non-compliance"". Citing ""collective responsibility"" for the bank's reputation, Catherine Livingstone, its chairwoman, has announced cuts to bonuses for Ian Narev, the chief executive, and others. 
Founded 106 years ago, CommBank, as it is known, is one of Australia's biggest banks. AUSTRAC traces its case to 2012, when the bank started installing ""intelligent deposit machines"". They accept cash, let depositors stay anonymous and allow money to be switched to other accounts in Australia and overseas straight away. CommBank sets a ceiling of A$20,000 per transaction through the machines, but no limit on the number of daily transactions. Australia's other three big banks--Westpac, Australia and New Zealand Bank and National Australia Bank--limit single transactions through their machines to about a quarter of that value. 
Shifting money around this way has become increasingly popular--in some months CommBank's machines have received A$1bn in cash deposits. The regulator says the bank took no steps to assess money-laundering and terrorism-financing risks from this deposit system until mid-2015, three years after it started. 
The Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorism Financing Act obliges banks to report cash transactions above A$10,000 made through their machines within ten days. AUSTRAC claims CommBank failed to do so for about 53,500 suspicious transactions valued in total at A$625m. Some were linked to money-laundering groups under investigation by the police; a few even involved customers CommBank itself saw as potential risks for terrorism financing. 
Deposits of A$27m into one account came from a drug syndicate, three members of which have been charged. The regulator says some CommBank accounts were used for ""cuckoo smurfing"", a form of laundering money from one country to another without sending it across a border. It said the bank's conduct exposed Australia to ""serious and ongoing financial crime"". 
Mr Narev admits CommBank made ""mistakes"". The bank blames these on a software ""coding error"" linked to its machines and says it has complied with its reporting obligations since late 2015. Each of the 53,500 alleged contraventions could attract a fine of A$18m, leading to a theoretical total of nearly A$1trn. But the bank suggests they could all stem from the same cause, the one coding error, so the fine might not be catastrophic. It is preparing a defence statement for the Federal Court. 
Many Australians resent bigger banks, believing that they put profits before customer service. Three years ago, a parliamentary committee criticised CommBank after revelations that some of its advisers had steered people into investments that soured. Malcolm Turnbull's conservative government has resisted calls from the Labor opposition for a royal-commission inquiry into banks. Instead, in its latest budget it imposed a levy on Australia's five biggest, to raise about A$1.5bn a year. 
The CommBank drama will only aggravate public exasperation with banks. Scott Morrison, the treasurer, has warned Ms Livingstone that the government will ""consider all options"", without naming them. Anna Bligh of the Australian Bankers' Association, a trade body, hopes that the CommBank affair will be a lesson ""for the entire financial industry"".

WHEN two Australian Greens senators left parliament last month after learning that they were dual citizens, and thus in breach of the constitution, Malcolm Turnbull, the prime minister, condemned their ""incredible sloppiness"". But on August 14th Barnaby Joyce, the deputy prime minister, revealed that he, too, was a citizen of two countries: Australia and New Zealand. His confession sparked a rare diplomatic row between the two countries. It also casts doubt on the survival of Mr Turnbull's government, which clings to power with a majority of one. 
Australia's constitution bans from the federal parliament anyone who is under ""acknowledgment of allegiance, obedience or adherence to a foreign power"", or who is ""a subject or a citizen or entitled to the rights or privileges of a subject or a citizen of a foreign power"". But in a country of high immigration, these strictures are causing unexpected political turmoil. In mid-July, Scott Ludlam of the Australian Greens resigned from the upper house, having just discovered he was a citizen of New Zealand. He left New Zealand when he was three, but never thought ""citizenship sticks to you in that way"". A few days later Larissa Waters, the other deputy leader of the party, tearfully announced her resignation. She had been born in Canada and moved to Australia as a baby, but had never renounced her Canadian citizenship. 
The circumstances of Matt Canavan, the former minister for resources, are even odder. The government was shaken when he declared on July 25th that he was both Italian and Australian. His mother, born in Australia to Italian parents, had secured Italian citizenship for herself and her son 11 years earlier. Mr Canavan says that he discovered this only when the citizenship row first erupted. 
Mr Canavan gave up his ministerial post, but not his Senate seat. Mr Joyce, a fellow member of the National Party, the junior coalition partner, took over his portfolio. Just three weeks later, though, Mr Joyce told parliament he was ""shocked"" to learn that he was a Kiwi because his father had been born in New Zealand before moving to Australia in 1947. 
Mr Joyce has a habit of highlighting his rural roots by wearing cowboy hats and giving whip-cracking displays. He is famous for playing the indignant patriot in a row over quarantine laws with Johnny Depp, a Hollywood actor. The opposition is revelling in his predicament, especially as the government would lose its majority if he had to quit. 
The dual-citizenship question has added fuel to Australia's already combustible politics. And the revelation that a staff member for a Labor senator had asked a New Zealand Labour MP about his country's citizenship rules before Mr Joyce's confession has turned the row into an international incident. Julie Bishop, Australia's foreign minister, accused New Zealand's Labour opposition of being ""involved in allegations designed to undermine the government of Australia"". Not so, retorted Jacinda Ardern, New Zealand's opposition leader. Undaunted, Mr Turnbull charged Australia's opposition of conspiring ""with a foreign power"". 
If this was a ploy to deflect embarrassment over Mr Joyce, it fell flat. It could damage trans-Tasman relations if Ms Ardern's party wins the general election due next month. And it ignores mounting calls to reform parliamentary citizenship rules drawn up in the 1890s, when Australia was still a colony of British subjects. The latest census, in 2016, revealed that 26% of Australians were born overseas; more than 300 languages are now spoken. 
On August 24th the High Court is due to start considering the case of the many dual-citizen MPs. Six have admitted doubts about their status; others have denied claims that they hold two nationalities. Mr Joyce has hurriedly renounced his New Zealand citizenship. Mr Turnbull argues he is qualified to stay in parliament ""and the High Court will so hold"". A rash claim, say some constitutional experts. George Williams, of the University of New South Wales, thinks all five politicians could be ""in great difficulty"" if they were dual citizens when first elected. There will be growing pressure to change the constitution. But any reform may come too late to help the beleaguered Mr Turnbull.","A row over who is eligible for parliament rattles the government

DIGGING stuff out of the ground and shipping it overseas has long been a mainstay of Australia's economy. So it is rare for governments to place curbs on such wealth. Australia banned iron-ore exports for 22 years until 1960 to protect its steel industry. It still limits where it will send uranium, but only to comply with nuclear non-proliferation rules. Last month, however, Malcolm Turnbull's conservative government said that it may restrict exports on another commodity that Australia holds in abundance underground: gas. 
Mr Turnbull likes to present himself as a champion of free markets. But in energy policy, he is backtracking. He has justified introducing what he calls the ""Australian domestic gas-security mechanism"" in response to soaring electricity prices. This could result in export controls being imposed early next year. There is no clear evidence that limiting sales abroad will help bring down the cost of energy at home. But Mr Turnbull wants to look as if he is trying, because voters are getting angry. 
Demand for gas in Australia has been growing as a result of the closure of coal-fired power stations. But domestic supplies are waning. A slump in oil prices has in turn hit global gas prices and deterred investors from exploring for fresh deposits. Moreover, New South Wales and Victoria, the most populous states, have banned or restricted gas exploration in response to environmental campaigns to protect farmlands and underground water. So has the Northern Territory where Origin Energy, an Australian company, is exploring for shale gas in the remote Beetaloo Basin. 
Strains on supplies have also been considerably increased by a boom in the export of liquefied natural gas (LNG) from Queensland over the past three years, much of it derived from coal-seams. Australia exported about two-thirds of the gas it produced last year, and even more in the first quarter this year: the country's main markets are in Japan, China and South Korea. Why sell the gas abroad if global prices are low and demand at home is so great? Companies are required to do so by contracts they signed several years ago, when international prices were much higher. 
Export controls will only be imposed if the government decides they are needed after it finishes studying gas-supply forecasts in September. Even if they are introduced, Australia will remain a big exporter of LNG. Western Australia has a large LNG industry. But the state reserves about 15% of its gas for home consumption, so it will be exempt. The export controls will apply only to newer consortia operating on the east coast, where most Australians live. Australia still hopes it can overtake Qatar as the biggest LNG exporter by 2019 (though Qatar's plans to expand its own exports may frustrate that ambition). 
Mr Turnbull is pulled in every direction over energy policy. Conservatives in his Liberal party are unfazed by gas shortages--they would far prefer that Australia dig more coal. Others want a higher share of gas and renewables in Australia's energy mix to help meet carbon-emission targets. States have differing views, too. South Australia has the country's highest share of renewables at almost 50%, and relies on gas for most of the rest of its electricity supply. After suffering a series of blackouts, that state recently announced a deal with Tesla, an American company, to install the world's biggest lithium battery. 
Graeme Bethune of EnergyQuest, a consultancy, worries that restricting exports could result in even more of a muddle. Uncertainties over when and to what degree restrictions might be applied may cause concern among investors, he says. But the country's energy regulator is already forecasting that there could be insufficient gas to meet electricity demand late next year and early in 2019. Mr Turnbull says any restrictions would only be a ""temporary measure"". But the threat of them will long persist.","Possible curbs on gas exports are mainly to do with politics

THE question reads, ""Should the law be changed to allow same-sex couples to marry?"" Ballots asking it have been posted to Australia's 16m registered voters. They have until early November to return them; the result will be announced on November 15th. Rallies for and against are being held around the country. Earlier this month 30,000 supporters of gay marriage gathered outside Sydney's town hall, waving placards with slogans like, ""It's a love story baby, just say yes."" 
One of those saying yes is Malcolm Turnbull, the prime minister. But many Australians criticise him for calling the vote at all. Opinion polls consistently show that most Australians support gay marriage. Proponents say a simple vote in parliament, which also has a majority in favour, would have saved money and avoided a divisive campaign. 
But if there is relatively little debate among Australians, there is a great deal within Mr Turnbull's (conservative) Liberal Party and its coalition partner, the Nationals. In 2004 a Liberal government, led by John Howard, amended the previously ambiguous law on marriage to define it as ""the union of a man and a woman to the exclusion of all others"". Tony Abbott, a more recent Liberal prime minister, tried to duck demands that parliament reverse this change by proposing in 2015 that Australians vote in a non-binding plebiscite instead. Mr Turnbull, for his part, once supported a parliamentary vote. But to win the support of conservative MPs for his campaign to supplant Mr Abbott two years ago, he accepted the idea of a plebiscite. 
Other parties, naturally, have been reluctant to help the Liberals paper over these internal differences. The Senate, where Mr Turnbull's government lacks a majority, rejected a bill to hold a plebiscite. Mr Turnbull's answer in August was to conduct a postal ""survey"" instead--a step that did not require parliament's approval. 
It is an unusual exercise. Voting is normally compulsory in Australia, and the results of referendums are binding. Neither condition applies to the ""Australian Marriage Law Postal Survey"". It is being conducted by the Australian Bureau of Statistics, not the body that oversees elections. Michael Kirby, a gay former High Court judge who supports gay marriage, says it is ""just something we've never done in our constitutional arrangements"". But the High Court dismissed legal challenges to the vote earlier this month. 
Mr Turnbull says the right to marry is a ""conservative ideal"". He lists 13 countries where gay marriage is legal, including Australia's main English-speaking allies. Mr Howard, who lost power ten years ago, has re-emerged to lead the No campaign. Mr Abbott has joined him. They are painting gay marriage as merely the first item on a radically permissive agenda. One ad for the No campaign suggests that it is only a matter of time before schools start encouraging children to cross-dress. 
Christine Forster, Mr Abbott's gay sister and a Liberal member of Sydney's city council, accuses her brother of playing ""Machiavellian games"" with an issue that has been an ""awful roller-coaster ride"". Gladys Berejiklian, the Liberal premier of New South Wales, the most populous state, calls gay marriage one of the most important human-rights issues ""of our time"". Australia is a ""laggard"", argues Frank Bongiorno of the Australian National University, because its main political parties have ""failed to translate long-standing consensus into change"". 
Several prominent business figures also support a Yes vote. Many worry that the government has mishandled the issue by drawing it out, allowing divisions within its ranks to overshadow pressing economic reforms. Mr Turnbull has promised prompt legislation if the Yes vote wins; he predicts it will ""sail through"" parliament. Although public opinion seems strongly in favour, the unprecedented method of voting makes turnout hard to predict. Some Yes campaigners worry that young voters have no idea how to use a letterbox. But if the No vote prevails, the opposition Labor party says it will still legalise gay marriage if it wins the next election, due in 2019.

 THE question reads , "" Should the law be changed to allow same - sex couples to marry ? "" Ballots asking it have been posted to Australia 's 16 m registered voters . They have until early November to return them ; the result will be announced on November 15th . Rallies for and against are being held around the country . Earlier this month 30,000 supporters of gay marriage gathered outside Sydney 's town hall , waving placards with slogans like , "" It 's a love story baby , just say yes . "" 
 One of those saying yes is Malcolm Turnbull . But many Australians criticise Malcolm Turnbull for calling the vote at all . Opinion polls consistently show that most Australians support gay marriage . Proponents say a simple vote in parliament , which also has a majority in favour , would have saved money and avoided a divisive campaign . 
 But if there is relatively little debate among Australians , there is a great deal within Malcolm Turnbull's ( conservative ) Liberal Party and its coalition partner , the Nationals . In 2004 a Liberal government , led by John Howard , amended the previously ambiguous law on marriage to define it as "" the union of a man and a woman to the exclusion of all others "" . Tony Abbott , a more recent Liberal prime minister , tried to duck demands that parliament reverse this change by proposing in 2015 that Australians vote in a non - binding plebiscite instead . Malcolm Turnbull , for Malcolm Turnbull's part , once supported a parliamentary vote . But to win the support of conservative MPs for Malcolm Turnbull's campaign to supplant Mr Abbott two years ago , Malcolm Turnbull accepted the idea of a plebiscite .

""THE prime reason for the decline in living standards for many Australian workers is our staggering population growth,"" thunders Dick Smith, a campaigning millionaire, in an apocalyptic manifesto. He is right about the staggering growth. The number of children the average Australian woman has fell below two in the 1970s and has stayed there. Yet since then Australia's population has grown by 70%, thanks almost entirely to immigration. Over 28% of today's residents were born overseas--a higher share than in Canada or New Zealand, let alone Britain or America. The number of newcomers continues to grow. Net overseas migration (a measure of immigrants minus departing Aussies) has nearly doubled since 2000. 
Mr Smith is also right about the decline in living standards, albeit only recently. Wage growth has been dragging along at its lowest rate in almost 20 years, and dipped below inflation earlier this year, meaning that the typical worker is losing purchasing power. Although the unemployment rate, at 5.6%, is low by the standards of recent decades, underemployment is close to a record. Philip Lowe, the governor of the Reserve Bank of Australia, the central bank, concedes that employees ""feel like there is more competition"" and are worried about ""foreigners and robots"". 
Yet, to the frustration of alarmists like Mr Smith, relatively few Australians seem to think the way to boost their incomes is to stem the influx of immigrants. In 2015 Gallup, a pollster, found that Australia was the only big Western country where more people thought immigration should rise (30%) than thought it should fall (25%). Regular surveys conducted by the Scanlon Foundation, which works to integrate immigrants, show that the sense that immigration is too high has fallen substantially since the 1990s. Pauline Hanson, a populist senator who made her name then, warning that Australia would be ""swamped"" by Asians, has started fulminating about Muslims instead, to little avail. When she recently tried to stir up public opinion by wearing a burqa in parliament, she attracted more ridicule than adulation. 
In part, that is because Australia has a long history of immigration, from Chinese joining the gold rushes of the 1850s and 1860s to Afghan camel drivers helping to explore the outback in the late nineteenth century. It helps, too, that the economy has been growing for 26 years without a recession, and that incomes have been growing faster than the population. In fact, immigrants have had a hand in that: a growing population consumes more goods and services. Recent immigrants have provided labour for a mining boom and, when that petered out, demand for housing and manpower to build it, helping to keep the economy ticking over. Some 600,000 foreigners spent A$20bn ($14.6bn) to attend Australian schools and universities last year, making education the country's third-biggest export. Many take local jobs and pay taxes after they graduate. 
It is true that immigration appears to have raised unemployment and lowered wages in certain industries. Bob Birrell of the Australian Population Research Institute notes that Australia's points-based system, which is designed to attract workers with skills that are in short supply, has brought a deluge of accountants and IT professionals. Over half of foreign students study business and commerce because they believe that will give them access to high-paying jobs, he says, but they are often left on ""the fringes of the labour market because it's difficult to compete with locals"". Overall, however, Australia's Productivity Commission finds no evidence that migrants suppress wages or displace locals from jobs. They help raise GDP per person, not lower it, in part by making Australia's population more youthful, thus offsetting the ageing of its baby boomers. 
But the surge in immigration has caused problems, most obviously in terms of planning. Theoretically, there ought to be plenty of space for the 230,000-odd yearly arrivals, since Australia is one of world's least densely populated countries. But the vast majority of its people, and an even greater share of its immigrants, cluster in a few cities near the coast. Despite substantial investment, urban infrastructure is struggling to keep pace. Melbourne and Sydney, in particular, are pulling at the seams. Commuters are subjected to snarling traffic, the costs of which are predicted to double by 2030. The number of passengers on Sydney's commuter trains, meanwhile, grew by 11% in the year to July. 
Immigration has also stoked house prices (see chart). In Sydney the average home costs A$1.2m, up almost 20% in a year. By one count, the city is the world's second-most expensive relative to incomes. The once-standard house on a quarter-acre lot is beyond the means of most. Those who do buy a home are heavily indebted: at 134%, the ratio of household debt to GDP is also one of the highest in the world. A recent analysis found that buyers in Sydney would need to make A$190,000 a year--more than triple the average salary--to repay their mortgages comfortably. 
The conservative government led by Malcolm Turnbull has promised to free more land for development and penalise investors who leave properties empty. But it has also pandered a bit to the likes of Mr Smith by changing immigration rules. The prime minister said he was ""putting Australians first"" by requiring temporary migrants to have more work experience and better language skills. He wants would-be citizens to pass tougher language tests and prove that they share Australian ""values"". Previously, new arrivals had to be able to identify Don Bradman, a celebrated cricketer (contrary to popular belief, they did not need to know his batting average). Mr Turnbull wants to be sure they frown on domestic violence and sexism. He might have added xenophobia to the list.

WHERE will it end? On October 27th the High Court stripped four senators and an MP of their seats, adopting a strict interpretation of the rules on eligibility for parliament. The MP was Barnaby Joyce, the deputy prime minister, whose ejection has cost the government its majority in the lower house. Then on November 1st Stephen Parry, the president of the Senate, announced that he, too, suffered from the same affliction: he was a dual national, able to claim British citizenship as well as Australian. He resigned the following day. 
Mr Joyce was one of the ""citizenship seven"", parliamentarians who discovered that they were deemed to be citizens, variously, of Britain, Canada, Italy and New Zealand, even though they had not formally claimed citizenship. Australia's constitution bans from parliament anyone who is under ""acknowledgment of allegiance, obedience or adherence to a foreign power"", or who is a citizen of a ""foreign power"". 
The government's lawyers argued that the ban should apply only if someone actively laid claim to a foreign nationality, not if they were ignorant that they were considered a citizen of another country, as the ""citizenship seven"" claimed to be. But the judges pointed out that parliamentary candidates must complete a nomination form that asks whether they might be ineligible because they are dual citizens. This, they said, is ""manifestly an occasion for serious reflection on this question"". 
As a result, the court removed five of the seven parliamentarians. It let off Matt Canavan, a senator from the Nationals, the junior party in the governing coalition, because it was unclear whether he was really an Italian citizen. Nick Xenophon, another senator, escaped because his form of British nationality, ""a British overseas citizen"", conveyed so few rights that it was unworthy of the name, in the court's view. 
Mr Joyce's ejection is a headache for the government. Although he was born in Australia, he learned in August that he was also considered a New Zealander because his father had been born in New Zealand before moving to Australia in 1947. Having renounced his Kiwi citizenship, Mr Joyce will try to reclaim his constituency at a by-election on December 2nd. Opinion polls suggest he has a good chance. In the meantime the government will control only 74 of the 150 seats in the lower house, not counting that of the speaker. It hopes to soldier through the final session of the year with the help of independents. 
The government already lacks a majority in the Senate, so the dismissal of the senators will not affect its functioning. Nevertheless, Mr Parry's case matters because he is the first member of the Liberal Party of the prime minister, Malcolm Turnbull, to fall foul of the citizenship rules. It transpires that he is a British citizen through his father, who emigrated to Australia in 1951. Mr Turnbull had sneered at the ""incredible sloppiness"" of some of the ""citizenship seven"" for not checking their status. Mr Parry says he waited to do so until after the High Court's ruling because it had now provided ""absolute clarity"". 
The drama has hastened calls to reform the rules. Australians were considered British subjects when the constitution came into force 116 years ago. Australian citizenship was created only in 1948. High levels of immigration since then have given plenty of people unwitting claims to foreign nationality. Some constitutional lawyers reckon all 226 federal parliamentarians should now have their backgrounds audited in a bid to clear up the mess. A parliamentary committee 20 years ago called for the constitution to be changed to allow any Australian citizen to serve in parliament. That would require a referendum, few of which succeed. 
Mr Turnbull has bravely asked a parliamentary committee to suggest a way forward. Meanwhile he insists that ""the business of government goes on."" Perhaps--but it has definitely become harder.

Virginia's lieutenant-governor, Ralph Northam, defeated his Republican opponent to win the governor's race. Democrats secured important victories in local and state elections, including the governorship of New Jersey, mayoral posts in North Carolina and New Hampshire and seats in state legislatures. 
Senator Rand Paul was attacked by his neighbour while mowing his lawn in Bowling Green, Kentucky. The senator is expected to return to Washington on November 13th, after recovering from six broken ribs and bruised lungs. The neighbour has been charged with assault. 
The Trump administration announced it would end a provisional visa programme for 2,500 Nicaraguan immigrants but deferred a decision on the fate of 57,000 Hondurans with the same designation. The ""Temporary Protected Status"" programme shielded the two groups from deportation after Hurricane Mitch swept through Central America in 1998. 
A not-so-Chile reception 
A Venezuelan opposition leader hid in the Chilean ambassador's house in Caracas after the supreme court moved to strip him of immunity from prosecution. Freddy Guevara said that the court was acting on behalf of President Nicolas Maduro's socialist regime, which passed a ""law against hate"" that criminalises dissent. The EU moved to ban shipments to Venezuela of arms and gear that could be used for repression. 
The Trump administration tightened sanctions on Cuba. It restricted educational and cultural travel and banned American citizens from visiting 180 hotels and businesses with alleged financial links to the Cuban armed forces. 
Colombian police seized more than 12 tonnes of cocaine, with an American market value of about $360m, in the largest drug bust in the country's history. 
At least five people were killed in clashes between supporters of the government and the opposition in Nicaragua following municipal elections. The Organisation of American States expressed ""profound concern"" and urged comprehensive electoral reform. 
Trump's grand tour 
Donald Trump embarked on a ten-day trip to Asia. He played golf with Japan's prime minister, Shinzo Abe, dined in the Forbidden City with China's leader Xi Jinping, and promised South Korean legislators that the dispute over North Korea's nuclear weapons ""will all work out"". 
China's rubber-stamp parliament increased the maximum punishment for disrespecting the national anthem to three years in jail. It also ruled that doing so should be illegal in Hong Kong, where booing of the national anthem is common at football matches. 
Yang Tongyan, a dissident Chinese writer, died of brain cancer having nearly completed a 12-year sentence for ""subverting state power"" by calling for greater democracy. He had previously spent a decade in jail for his involvement in the Tiananmen Square protests. 
The head of the local government in Delhi, India's capital, likened the city to a gas chamber. Schools and many offices were closed as smoke from farmers burning stubble in adjacent states caused air quality to plummet.

FINALLY, after voting that lasted two months, November 15th brought a result. To the question ""Should the law be changed to allow same-sex couples to marry?"" almost 62% of Australians said yes; 38% said no. The Yes vote prevailed in all six of Australia's states and its two main territories. Barely hiding a sense of relief, if not triumph, Malcolm Turnbull, the prime minister, called the result ""overwhelming"". He promised that a parliamentary vote to legalise gay marriage would follow by Christmas. 
At rallies around the country, supporters of change cheered the prospect. But the issue has long divided Mr Turnbull's conservative Liberal Party. The Marriage Act originally left the meaning of marriage undefined. John Howard, a Liberal prime minister, had it amended in 2004 to specify ""the union of a man and a woman"". 
A leader of his party's progressive wing, Mr Turnbull once favoured reversing this change with a parliamentary vote. But as a delaying tactic Tony Abbott, Mr Turnbull's predecessor, proposed a non-binding plebiscite. Mr Turnbull acquiesced in that policy when he unseated Mr Abbott as Liberal leader and prime minister in 2015. 
After parliament rejected legislation to allow the plebiscite, his answer was to hold a plebiscite by another name: the ""Australian Marriage Law Postal Survey"", which Australians have just completed. It did not require parliamentary approval, since it was not a formal vote. Yet Australians took it seriously. Almost four-fifths of 16m eligible voters participated. David Kalisch, the head of the statistical bureau that oversaw the proceedings, calls this ""outstanding for a voluntary survey and well above other voluntary exercises conducted around the world"". 
The campaign was hard-fought. In full-page newspaper advertisements Mr Howard warned of threats to ""parental rights, freedom of speech and religious freedom"" if Australians voted for gay marriage. The Anglican church in Sydney donated A$1m ($760,000) to the No campaign. Alan Joyce, the openly gay head of Qantas, Australia's biggest airline, donated A$1m of his own money to the Yes camp. Jennifer Westacott, the head of the Business Council of Australia, a lobby group, declared that she had been in a same-sex relationship for 30 years and had ""spent my whole life feeling like an outsider"". 
The focus will now shift to parliament. Dean Smith, an openly gay Liberal member of the Senate (the upper house), introduced a bill to allow gay marriage within hours of the survey result. The opposition Labor Party supports it. Liberals, previously bound by their party's opposition to gay marriage, will now have a free vote. 
James Paterson, a conservative Liberal, wants not only clergy (as in Mr Smith's bill) but also businesses to be free to refuse to participate in gay weddings. But Mr Turnbull says Mr Smith's measure is ""clearly a good bill to start with"". The government, he maintains, would not ""countenance making legal discrimination that is...unlawful today"". The Liberals, in other words, are as divided as ever. 
Mr Turnbull is already under pressure. His government has lost its majority in the lower house, after the forced resignation of two MPs from the governing coalition found to be dual nationals and thus in breach of the constitution. At least until by-elections next month, Mr Turnbull must rely on support from independents. 
The citizenship mess was not of Mr Turnbull's making, but it has taken a toll. The government trailed the opposition by ten points in a recent opinion poll. Australians' ringing endorsement of gay marriage gives him a chance to reclaim some authority, by bringing about a change he has long advocated. Both houses of parliament are due to reconvene on November 27th for the year's final session. How he shepherds the legislation to make good on his promise may well prove pivotal not just for gay Australians but for his own career.","The government promises to change the law by the end of the year

THE bars along Wood Street have gone quiet. Thirsty mine workers on six-figure salaries have become a rarity since a coal-exporting boom ended. Boom-bust cycles are hardly new for this northern coastal city in the state of Queensland. But Greg Williamson, the mayor, says: ""The cliff we fell off this time was enormous."" Many see salvation in a plan by Adani, a firm based in the Indian state of Gujarat, to build Australia's biggest thermal coalmine in the remote Galilee Basin, about 300km (190 miles) west of Mackay (see map). The proposal has ignited protests around Australia, and could even decide the outcome of a state election on November 25th. 
Coal has long helped Australia prosper. It is its second-biggest export (after iron ore), and Queensland's biggest. The industry employs over 40,000 people. Adani wants to build a railway 388km across the outback from the Galilee Basin to a terminal it owns at Abbot Point, north of Mackay. From there, the coal will be shipped through the Great Barrier Reef, just offshore, to power stations in India. 
But Adani has yet to secure financing for the A$16.5bn ($12.5bn) project. Australia's four biggest banks have demurred. One of them, Westpac, announced a climate policy in April to limit lending for new thermal-coal projects to ""existing coal-producing basins only"", in effect ruling out the as yet untapped Galilee Basin. 
The banks' reluctance reflects wider misgivings. Many Australians are queasy about the primacy of globe-warming coal in their power supply (it provides almost two-thirds of the country's electricity). They consider it hypocritical to be boosting exports of coal even as Australia seeks to cut its own emissions of greenhouse gases. And they fear harm to the Great Barrier Reef, from the increased maritime traffic and the warming effect of the coal once it is burnt. 
Last month thousands of people spelled out the words ""Stop Adani"" in co-ordinated rallies around the country, including one on Bondi Beach in Sydney, 2,000km south of the proposed mine. Geoffrey Cousins, a businessman and head of the Australian Conservation Foundation, a pressure group, says such protests have turned into the biggest environmental campaign ""ever run in Australia"". 
Others worry more about the economy. Queensland's Bowen Basin, south-west of Mackay, fed the most recent boom, thanks largely to China's demand for coking coal to make steel. About three years ago, after falling coal prices prompted mining firms to slash jobs, Mackay and other cities began to suffer. Townsville, where Adani has opened an office, has 9% unemployment, two-thirds higher than the national rate. 
Peter McCallum lost his job as a courier, and now runs the Mackay Conservation Group, an environmental outfit. Adani claims that opening up the Galilee Basin will provide 10,000 direct and indirect jobs. Mr McCallum doubts it. 
Annastacia Palaszczuk, Queensland's premier, visited Mackay and Townsville during the campaign's final week. Her minority Labor government is chasing a second term against the conservative alliance of Liberals and Nationals led by Tim Nicholls, a former state treasurer. The Adani project loomed large in the campaign. The company has applied for a loan from the Northern Australia Infrastructure Facility, a federal body, to meet almost half the A$2.5bn cost of building the railway, which is crucial to the whole venture. 
At first Ms Palaszczuk supported such a loan in order to create jobs. But just days into her campaign, she declared that she would block any disbursement if re-elected. She says she wants to avoid accusations of bias: her partner worked for the firm that handled Adani's loan application. Others detected a more political calculation: to save votes in cities such as Brisbane where the project is unpopular. A recent opinion poll showed 68% of Australians opposed a taxpayer-funded loan to Adani, and Labor was leading narrowly in pre-election polls in Queensland. 
Malcolm Turnbull, the prime minister, accused Ms Palaszczuk of being beholden to an ""inner-city, Green-left agenda"" with a ""total rejection of coal in all its forms"". But not everyone in the coal industry supports the loan: the Infrastructure Fund, co-owner of Australia's biggest coal port at Newcastle in New South Wales, commissioned research on the impact of starting to export from the Galilee Basin. It found output and jobs from existing coal mines in New South Wales and southern Queensland would suffer. Jonathan van Rooyen of the company says the federal government's ""billion-dollar support for the Galilee coal basin is not just playing state against state, it's mate against mate."" 
Others question the scheme's economic viability. After crunching costs against projected returns, John Quiggin, an economist at the University of Queensland, argues that ""any public funds advanced to the project will be at high risk of loss."" Adani is reportedly negotiating funding in China; the company says it is ""very well advanced getting our finances internationally"". Queensland's voters, in other words, are not the only people being asked to take a punt on the project.

EARLY morning fusillades of gibberish are nothing new in the Trump presidency. Nor is a tendency to attack allies, or to give encouragement to racist groups. On November 29th, though, the president achieved a rare triple. On waking he seems to have grabbed his phone to attack CNN, give air to an old conspiracy theory and broadcast propaganda from a hitherto obscure band of British xenophobes to his 43.6m Twitter followers. Later in the day he had a go at Britain's prime minister, Theresa May, whose office had earlier criticised him for thinking with his thumb. One sound strategy for staying sane in 2017 has been to ignore Mr Trump's tweets. Yet this morning barrage revealed traits that go to the core of the man in the Oval Office. 
One is an astonishing lack of curiosity about where information comes from. Britain First, whose nonsense the president retweeted, was until this week at the fringe of the fringe of far-right English politics. Its members are a hapless bunch, too boneheaded to conceal their animus against brown people. The group's leader, Paul Golding, was expelled from the slightly more mainstream British National Party (BNP), which itself is marginal (it gained more than 1% of the vote in only three of Britain's 650 parliamentary constituencies in the general election earlier this year). Mr Golding was deemed too racist for the BNP when he picked a fight with its only non-white council member. Mr Golding has a taste for actual fights, too: he has admitted a charge of assault. As hardly anyone in Britain had heard of Britain First, neither presumably had Mr Trump. But the group sounded like America First, which must have been flattering and therefore good. And it seemed to share Mr Trump's views on Muslims, which was good, too. That was all the information the president needed before giving his endorsement. 
A second characteristic is a thin skin. Despite the power of his office, Mr Trump often feels picked-upon. When Mrs May's staff rebuked him for the Britain First stuff, he could not resist: ""Theresa, don't focus on me, focus on the destructive Radical Islamic Terrorism that is taking place within the United Kingdom. We are doing just fine!"" When Mr Trump was rebuked for criticising London's (Muslim) mayor after a lethal terrorist attack, his tweets on the subject became more frenzied. Mr Trump felt similarly aggrieved when he was denounced for his equivocal response to a white-supremacist march in Charlottesville (""many sides"" were to blame). 
Mrs May, whose government badly wants a trade deal with America after Britain leaves the European Union, was taking a calculated risk. Most foreign leaders have already worked out that the president responds well to big parades and badly to well-intentioned criticism. In Mrs May's case, though, the rebuke was worth it. Mr Trump has, amazingly, managed to unite MPs who can agree on little else right now, as well as to promote interfaith dialogue. Prominent British Muslims were joined in condemnation by the Archbishop of Canterbury, Justin Welby. Britain's Chief Rabbi, Ephraim Mirvis, has previously said he thinks Mr Trump is a racist. After his election win last year, discussions about a state visit to Britain began. One sticking point was that Mr Trump wished the occasion to be optimised for pomp: gilded horse-drawn carriages and all. It was thought more prudent, if he came, to helicopter him in to the queen's garden, avoiding crowds of protesters. If the state visit happened tomorrow, there might be a riot. 
The good news, for transatlantic relations at least, is that Mr Trump's tendency to go after steadfast allies can be put right, with a little stroking. Malcolm Turnbull, Australia's prime minister, was an early victim, but America's policy towards it has barely changed. British prime ministers are obsequiously paranoid about maintaining what they see as the special relationship with America's presidents. Moreover, the foundation of the relationship is shared intelligence and diplomacy, which is relatively tweet-resistant. In fact, for Mrs May, who is trying to negotiate the world's most complicated divorce while hampered by unpopularity and a self-sabotaging cabinet, a spat with Mr Trump could be just what she needs.

THE quest has failed many times. The past 20 years have seen around 50 attempts to pass laws in different Australian states to allow doctors to help terminally ill people end their lives. All have suffered defeat. But on November 29th Victoria finally made history, when its parliament passed Australia's first state law to legalise doctor-assisted dying. 
The law, which will take effect in 2019, allows people with an advanced, incurable illness to request ""assisted dying"" if their suffering cannot be relieved ""in a manner that the person considers tolerable"". Patients must make three successive requests for such help; doctors are banned from initiating discussion of it as an option. The original bill had proposed limiting eligibility to those who were expected to live no more than a year. Victoria's lawmakers reduced that to six months, with a few exceptions. 
Most earlier attempts to legalise assisted dying were private members' bills, but the state government proposed this one. Brian Owler, a neurosurgeon advising the government, believes this was crucial to its success. Daniel Andrews, Victoria's premier, and Jill Hennessy, its health minister, both said that seeing a parent suffer from a debilitating illness had led them to support the law. 
Assisted dying is legal only in Colombia, Canada, a few European countries and some American states. Mr Andrews says the new law is the most conservative in the world. Yet it has rankled some other members of his party, Labor. Paul Keating, a former Labor prime minister, says it ""stands for everything a truly civil society should stand against"". 
It has divided doctors, too. Michael Gannon, head of the Australian Medical Association, a lobby group, says Victoria's parliament has ""changed one of the fundamentals of medical ethics"". Doctors are ""concerned about where it might lead"". Mr Owler retorts: ""It's not about doctors. It's about people who are suffering and dying."" Andrew McGee, a health-law specialist at Queensland University of Technology, thinks Victoria's law prevailed because the government had embarked earlier on a ""thorough"" public inquiry that reassured people ""this type of regime can succeed."" 
Australia has six states and two self-governing territories. The Northern Territory legalised assisted dying 21 years ago. But the national government can overturn territorial legislation, and did so on that occasion within a year. It has no such power over state laws, however. Malcolm Turnbull, Australia's prime minister, who leads the right-wing Liberal Party, says he would not have voted for Victoria's law. But Mr Owler is confident it will become a ""blueprint"" for change elsewhere in Australia.

Daniel Andrews , Victoria 's premier , and Jill Hennessy , its health minister , both said that seeing a parent suffer from a debilitating illness had led them to support the law . 
 Assisted dying is legal only in Colombia , Canada , a few European countries and some American states . Mr Andrews says the new law is the most conservative in the world . Yet it has rankled some other members of his party , Labor . Paul Keating , a former Labor prime minister , says it "" stands for everything a truly civil society should stand against "" . 
 It has divided doctors , too . Michael Gannon , head of the Australian Medical Association , a lobby group , says Victoria 's parliament has "" changed one of the fundamentals of medical ethics "" . Doctors are "" concerned about where it might lead "" . Mr Owler retorts : "" It 's not about doctors . It 's about people who are suffering and dying . "" Andrew McGee , a health - law specialist at Queensland University of Technology , thinks Victoria 's law prevailed because the government had embarked earlier on a "" thorough "" public inquiry that reassured people "" this type of regime can succeed . "" 
 Australia has six states and two self - governing territories . The Northern Territory legalised assisted dying 21 years ago . But the national government can overturn territorial legislation , and did so on that occasion within a year . It has no such power over state laws , however . Malcolm Turnbull's says Malcolm Turnbull would not have voted for Victoria 's law . But Mr Owler is confident it will become a "" blueprint "" for change elsewhere in Australia .

OVER the past year Australia has been gripped by a tale of suspicion, subversion and spooks. In the latest chapter Sam Dastyari, a Labor Party politician of Iranian extraction, resigned from parliament on December 12th. A recording had emerged of him urging Australia to ""respect"" China's territorial claims in the South China Sea, contradicting the policy of both the government and his own party, and confirming earlier allegations against him. He also tried to stop his party's foreign-affairs spokesperson meeting a pro-democracy activist in Hong Kong. A year earlier he had been forced to leave his opposition post, after revelations that he had taken money from Huang Xiangmo, a Chinese businessman with apparent links to the Chinese Communist Party, at the same time as he supported China's territorial claims. 
Widespread evidence of Chinese meddling in politics and universities prompted an Australian spy chief to warn that his country was facing ""an unprecedented scale"" of foreign interference. The country's prime minister, Malcolm Turnbull, is clearly worried. Further revelations showed that two Chinese companies, one run by Mr Huang, had (legally) donated A$6.7m ($5m) over a decade to Australia's two main political parties. On December 5th the government announced legislation banning political donations from non-citizens and requiring political lobbyists to reveal if they are working for foreigners. 
Australia is not alone. In September the Financial Times reported that a New Zealand MP had taught at a Chinese spy college for years but had left that information off his CV when he later applied for citizenship. That prompted growing calls for more scrutiny of China's influence over the Chinese diaspora in New Zealand. Canada's intelligence services have long been worried about infiltration: in 2010 they warned that several provincial cabinet ministers and government employees were ""agents of influence"". 
China seems to have been busy in Europe, too. Germany's spy agency this week accused it of using social media to contact 10,000 German citizens, including lawmakers and civil servants, in the hope of ""gleaning information and recruiting sources"". There have been reports of Chinese agents trying to groom up-and-coming politicians from Britain, especially those with business links to the country. And on December 13th America started to learn of possible intervention, when the Congressional Executive Commission on China began hearings to look into Chinese attempts to win political sway. 
Piercing, not soft 
China's approach could be called ""sharp power"". It stops well short of the hard power, wielded through military force or economic muscle; but it is distinct from the soft attraction of culture and values, and more malign. Sharp power is a term coined by the National Endowment for Democracy (NED), a think-tank in Washington, DC, funded mainly by Congress. It works by manipulation and pressure. Anne-Marie Brady of the University of Canterbury in New Zealand refers to China's intrusions as a ""new global battle"" to ""guide, buy or coerce political influence"". 
The result is different from the cold war--less dangerous, but harder to deal with. Whereas the Soviet Union and the West were sworn enemies, China is a keenly courted trading partner that is investing huge sums beyond its borders (see chart 1 on next page). This naturally gives it influence, which it is using to shape debate abroad in areas where it wants to muzzle criticism, such as its political system, human-rights abuses and expansive territorial claims. It especially wants to stifle discussion of the Dalai Lama, Falun Gong, an outlawed spiritual movement, and the Tiananmen Square protests of 1989. 
China is hardly alone in trying to shape how the world sees it. And its sharp power, though growing rapidly, is not its first attempt at the game. Over the years China has often tried to silence criticism of its politics by denying visas to critical journalists and academics and by giving a cold-shoulder to unsympathetic governments and firms. It has also attempted to monitor and control ethnic Chinese living outside the country, using Chinese-language media and China-backed community groups. 
China has long used soft power, too. Roughly 500 government-funded and government-staffed Confucius Institutes operate in universities and 1,000 ""Confucius classrooms"" in schools around the world, mostly in rich countries. The institutes do a good job of teaching Chinese to foreigners but they would be unlikely to convince students in the West that China's authoritarianism is admirable, even if they tried. 
Sharp power wraps all that up in something altogether more sinister. It seeks to penetrate and subvert politics, media and academia, surreptitiously promoting a positive image of the country, and misrepresenting and distorting information to suppress dissent and debate. China's sharp power has three striking characteristics--it is pervasive, it breeds self-censorship and it is hard to nail down proof that it is the work of the Chinese state. 
Sharp elbows 
Start with its pervasiveness. Most governments and intelligence agencies ignored China's manipulations because they believed that state surveillance and intervention were mainly directed at the country's diaspora. They were mistaken. The target now seems to include the wider society. 
Confucius Institutes have turned sharper. Many cash-strapped universities have replaced their own language courses with curriculums led by the institutes. In some places the institutes have set up entirely new China-studies programmes. Though most do not actively push the party line, they often restrain debate about China by steering discussion away from sensitive subjects. 
Occasionally China's motives are more obvious. State-backed organisations such as the Chinese Students and Scholars Association (CSSA), often funded by Chinese embassies, have become more assertive. The CSSA offers assistance to the growing number of Chinese students on foreign campuses (see chart 2). It helps them settle in by, for example, organising social events. It also keeps an eye on students and sometimes reports to the authorities back home on people who take part in activities seen as hostile to the party (an Australian academic says that for this reason, many Chinese students ask to be put in tutorial groups without other Chinese). 
Disquiet at China's presumed interference is spreading around Western democracies. It is now growing in America, where Chinese influence to date has been mostly under the radar. Nevertheless, James Clapper, director of national intelligence until January 2017, warned after stepping down of a danger of complacency, saying that China's growing influence threatened to undermine the ""very fundamental underpinnings"" of the political systems of America and Australia. 
Some political leaders, academics and think-tanks are starting to push back. At the hearing on Capitol Hill this week, Senator Marco Rubio, co-chair of the Congressional Executive Commission on China, expressed frustration that policymakers and business leaders seem ""asleep"" while China mounts ""insidious"" attacks on academic independence and free expression, and co-opts American firms or universities dazzled by the size of the Chinese market. 
The hearing discussed elaborate efforts to control Chinese students in America. Sophie Richardson of Human Rights Watch, an NGO, described Chinese police visiting the parents of a student who two days earlier had raised ""touchy subjects"" in a closed-door college seminar in America. Mr Rubio noted government attempts to curb enrolment by Chinese students at the University of California in San Diego, after a speech by the Dalai Lama there. Meanwhile, Chinese attempts to co-opt public officials and academics, even at state and local level, continue apace. Chinese operations are ""an extraordinarily important geopolitical issue,"" said Mr Rubio. 
The immediate aim of Chinese sharp power is often self-censorship. Sometimes that takes pressure. In August the Chinese government asked a number of academic publishers to censor their databases of academic articles to exclude sensitive subjects such as the Tiananmen Square protests and unrest among ethnic Uighurs in Xinjiang. Springer and Cambridge University Press complied but, following furious criticism in the West, CUP reinstated the items. 
In November, at short notice, an Australian publisher withdrew a book, ""Silent Invasion"", citing possible defamation suits from ""Beijing's agents of influence"". For those already anxious about rising Chinese intervention, the news appeared to confirm their worst fears--and substantiate the academic's argument, summed up in the volume's subtitle, ""How China is turning Australia into a Puppet State"". 
It is not only publishers that are feeling China's coercive powers. A French film festival this summer decided not to screen a Chinese feature that painted a dreary and bleak image of contemporary China. It cited ""official pressures"" from the Chinese authorities as the reason. 
Chinese ownership of firms abroad may also be a threat. Last year 16 members of America's Congress requested a government review of foreign activity in certain strategic industries: they cited particular unease about Dalian Wanda, a Chinese property firm that owns a Hollywood studio as well as two cinema chains in America, because of ""growing concerns about China's efforts to censor topics and exert propaganda controls on American media"". 
The long arm of the state 
Other Chinese state-backed organisations have been trying to strengthen their partnerships with Western think-tanks and universities, partly in order to limit criticism of China and its policies. Many such institutions in the West thirst for cash; taking it from Chinese institutions (all of them in China have party links) has become an ""almost normalised"" practice, says Peter Mattis of Jamestown, a think-tank in Washington, DC. In Australia Mr Huang, the Chinese businessman who had donated money to political parties, also gave almost A$2m to help launch the Australia-China Relations Institute, a think-tank in Sydney. He has since resigned from its board. 
Even without direct pressure from Chinese officials, bosses on Western campuses sometimes worry about future funding if scholars offend the Communist Party. Favours for donated money may be called in at a later stage. Academics report being asked not to invite particular speakers to conferences, for example. 
Influence is obvious elsewhere, too. Chinese state media have expanded abroad, presenting a rosy, party-sanctioned view of China. In 2015 an investigation by Reuters, a news agency, revealed that a subsidiary of the Chinese government, China Radio International, was also covertly backing at least 33 radio stations in 14 countries, including Australia and America. These formed a global network broadcasting positive news about China--mostly in English and Chinese, but also in Italian, Thai and Turkish. Their government ties were hidden by front companies. 
Usually, such investigations fail to pin down who is responsible--another feature of sharp power. On four occasions since May, students (mostly Chinese) rounded on Australian professors for hurting the feelings of the Chinese people (a popular Communist Party complaint). A lecturer was said to be picking on the Chinese when he wrote a notice in Chinese as well as English telling students not to cheat. A professor used a map that showed India's interpretation of a disputed Himalayan border with China. Another referred to Taiwan as an independent country. And a fourth used a Chinese saying in an exam that Chinese officials tell the truth only when ""drunk or careless"". 
Surprisingly, each incident was followed by a storm of social-media commentary and newspaper articles criticising the academics. In one case the Chinese consulate complained. Two of the universities kowtowed: one professor apologised on national television and another was suspended; a third lecturer wrote a lengthy apology. Perhaps, not untypically for Chinese students abroad, they were acting out of a genuine feeling of affronted patriotism. Whether prompted or not, such responses act to dissuade others from voicing criticism in the future. 
Even the case of Mr Dastyari is hard to prove. It certainly looks bad. He was labelled an ""agent of influence"" by a former Australian intelligence officer. His support for China in the South China Sea reportedly followed a warning from Mr Huang that he would withdraw funding to Mr Dastyari's Labor Party because it backed Australian naval activity in the disputed waters. And, in a meeting after he stepped down from the opposition front-bench, Mr Dastyari seemed to want to protect Mr Huang from Australia's counter-intelligence service, by warning him that his phone might be tapped. 
Yet no crime has been alleged. Mr Dastyari denies any wrongdoing and insists that nothing influenced his remarks on China's activities in the South China Sea other than ""the national interest"". The most commonly cited evidence that he was working for the Chinese is Mr Huang's links with the Communist Party. In fact, until November Mr Huang led the Australian branch of a party-affiliated organisation, the China Council for the Promotion of Peaceful National Reunification. That is fishy, but not proof of party ties or that he has received direction from the party. 
A winning formula? 
Will China's sharp power prove a success? One of its aims is to prevent foreign-based Chinese from undermining the party at home. Under Xi Jinping's autocratic leadership, the political environment has changed dramatically. For the first time since Mao Zedong's era, it has a highly visible strongman in charge. He has crushed rivals and sown fear among officials high and low with a ruthless campaign against corruption. Human rights are trampled upon. China wants to be sure that the programme of control at home is not vulnerable to the lack of control abroad. 
Its other aim is harder to accomplish. As a rising power, China naturally wants to make the world more congenial to its interests. Here, too, Mr Xi stands out from his predecessors. Gone is Deng Xiaoping's edict that China should keep a low profile in global affairs by ""hiding brightness [and] nourishing obscurity"". Mr Xi has called on China to ""turn up"" its voice on the world stage. He has built military infrastructure on disputed artificial islands in the South China Sea, sent naval vessels on exercises with Russia as far afield as the Mediterranean and the Baltic Sea, and, in August, opened the country's first military base overseas, in Djibouti. 
As a counterpart to this hard power, China seems to want to market itself as a responsible global citizen. But sharp power is a difficult weapon to yield. It mutes criticism and may make opinions more favourable (see chart 3). But, in Australia at least, the growing approval of China may now have turned the other way as a backlash starts to take hold. Posters were recently put up at several universities threatening Chinese citizens with deportation; ""Kill Chinese"" was daubed in a toilet at the University of Sydney, with a swastika underneath the graffiti; Chinese teenagers were beaten up at a bus stop in Canberra. 
China's sharp power poses a conundrum to Western policymakers. One danger is that policies designed to smooth over relations whip up anti-Chinese hysteria instead. Suspicions of China could run wild. Barriers to academic, economic and cultural co-operation with China could go up. Rather than learning to live with each other, China and the West might drift into sullen miscomprehension. The other concern is that policymakers play down the risks. If so, the public and politicians in the West may underestimate the threat from China's rise. How do you strike the balance between self-protection and engagement? Just now, nobody is quite sure.","The Chinese government is using stealth to shape public opinion and mute criticism in other countries

Business
All eyes were on America's latest inflation report, following the turmoil in markets that was fed in part by worries that central banks will step up increases to interest rates in response to inflationary pressures. Consumer prices rose by 0.5% in January, or 2.1% on an annual basis, more than had been forecast in surveys of economists, but wage inflation was subdued. Investors remain skittish; the yield on American ten-year government bonds jumped to 2.9%, a four-year high. A few days earlier the Bank of England's statement that it would have to raise rates ""somewhat earlier and by a somewhat greater extent"" than it had expected had sparked another sell-off.

America's latest round of sanctions against Russia hit hard, causing Russian stockmarkets to dive and the rouble to plunge.

The prancing unicorn
Jack Ma was reportedly preparing to raise up to $i0bn in a round of private funding for Ant Financial, a mobilepayments group that he controls.

Underlining the sanctions ' potency , Ivan Glasenberg , the chief executive of Glencore , resigned from Rusal 's board , which he had joined in 2007 . 
 Stockmarkets in general had another volatile week , in part because sentiment fluctuated about the prospects of a trade war between America and China . Heightened geopolitical tensions over Syria pushed oil prices higher ( some good news at least for the Russian economy ) . Brent crude climbed above $ 72 a barrel , its highest level since 2014 . 
 Deutsche Bank ousted John Cryan as chief executive , three years into his five - year contract . The German lender has suffered three consecutive annual losses and Paul Achleitner , the chairman , was said to be unhappy with the slow pace of the bank 's turnaround . Still , several investors complained about the manner of Mr Cryan 's defenestration , which could make for a turbulent annual shareholders ' meeting next month . The new ceo is Christian Sewing , who headed Deutsche 's retail bank . 
 A new driver 
 Deutsche Bank was n't the only illustrious German company shaking up its management . Volkswagen was reportedly ready to replace Matthias Müller as chief executive with Herbert Diess , who heads its core passenger - car brand . Mr Müller got the ceo 's job in September 2015 , when Martin Winterkorn resigned in the wake of the carmaker 's emissions - cheating scandal . 
 The Turkish lira fell to another low against the dollar in part because of concerns about Turkey 's push for growth at any cost . Recep Tayyip Erdogan , the president , unveiled an investment package this week and again called forinterest rates to remain subdued . That spooked investors already worried that Mr Erdogan 's pronouncements on monetary policy are hampering the central bank 's freedom to raise rates . Inflation remains stubbornly high ati0 % and the current - account deficit has risen on an annual basis . 
 Investors were taken by surprise when Saudi Arabia sold $ iibn - worth of bonds without the customary roadshow . It is thought that the kingdom may have been trying to get a jump on Qatar , which it has been feuding with since last June and which is in the process of drumming up support for its own sale of government debt . 
 Novartis added to its expanding gene - therapy business by agreeing to pay $ 8.7bn for AveXis , which specialises in treatments for spinal muscular atrophy , a genetic condition that causes progressive muscle wasting . 
 The prancing unicorn 
 Jack Ma was reportedly preparing to raise up to $ i0bn in a round of private funding for Ant Financial , a mobilepayments group that he controls . Mr Ma created Ant in 2011 to house the Alipay network , which he spun out from his Alibaba empire . With 520 m users , Alipay is the world 's biggest mobile - payments platform , though most of its business is in China . Mr Ma 's latest round of fundraising could value Ant at $ 150bn , which would make it the most valuable startup in the world , way ahead of the likes of Uber and Didi Chuxing , two ride - hailing firms . 
 The European Banking Authority reported that 77 % of the top earners among European bankers ( those with remuneration packages of at least € 1 m , or $ 1.1 m , in 2016 ) were based in Britain . That was a long way ahead of Germany , the next country in the ranking , where 5 % of top earners resided . 
 A fat - finger mistake by an employee at a South Korean brokerage led to 2.8bn shares worth $ 100bn being issued to staff in error . The employee typed "" shares "" instead of "" won "" when distributing dividends in the Korean currency . It took the brokerage half an hour to spot the slip , during which time 16 members of staff took advantage of their windfall and sold their wrongly allocated stock .

Australia is nervous ab out the growing Chinese presence on its doorstep
THE new wharf at Espíritu Santo island in Vanuatu is one of the longest in the South Pacific. Built by Chinese contractors with a loan from the Chinese government, it can accommodate three cargo ships or two cruise liners at the same time. But it is not its capacity that has attracted attention in nearby Australia (see map). Press reports there suggest that the governments of China and Vanuatu have been discussing the establishment of a Chinese naval base on Espiritu Santo. Although Vanuatu's foreign minister, Ralph Regenvanu, roundly dismissed the reports, Malcolm Turnbull, Australia's prime minister, took the story sufficiently seriously to say, ""We would view with great concern the establishment of any foreign military bases in those Pacific Island countries."" Vanuatu's prime minister has since reassured him in person that no base is in the offing.
China has greatly expanded its presence in Pacific countries in recent years, mainly by financing infrastructure projects like the wharf. But Chinese firms have diversified beyond such development schemes into commercial construction. Mining, including the $2bn Ramu nickel mine in Papua New Guinea and gold and bauxite mines in Fiji, has also attracted Chinese capital.
Australian officials are clearly spooked. Last year the country's spy chief, Nick Warner, persuaded the prime minister of the Solomon Islands to drop a deal with Huawei, a Chinese telecoms firm, to lay a subsea internet cable to Australia. Instead, the Australian government is financing the project itself. In January Australia's international development minister, Concetta Fierravanti-Wells, accused China of deliberately indebting Pacific islands by constructing ""useless buildings"" and ""roads to nowhere""-comments the Chinese government dismissed as ""full of ignorance and prejudice"".
There is no doubt that external debt is piling up all over the Pacific. Vanuatu's stands at around a third of gdp, and around half of that is owed to China. Samoa's debt amounts to 50% of gdp, around 40% of which is owed to China. Two-thirds of Tonga's debt, which is also about half of its gdp, is held by China. Tonga came close to default in 2013. China was not willing to write off any of its debt, but did suspend repayments for five years.
But leaving Pacific governments beholden is a far cry from building a naval base. The Chinese navy ventures only occasionally and cautiously into the distant reaches of the Pacific, usually in the form of a courtesy call by a hospital or training ship to a friendly country such as Fiji. China only has one foreign base at the moment, in Djibouti in the Horn of Africa, right next to the main shipping lane between Asia and Europe. Vanuatu, by contrast, is a much less strategic spot.
Moreover, if China does want to build a base, Vanuatu would be a peculiar choice. Its government has changed 24 times since independence in 1980. The constant political intrigue sometimes manifests itself in foreign-policy rows. Fiji, which has been at odds with Australia ever since a military coup in 2006, is much better disposed towards China. More deeply indebted Tonga, meanwhile, has an enticing harbour at Vava'u in the country's north. What they all have in common, however, is a knack for exploiting geopolitical rivalries (oscillating between China and Taiwan has been a common ploy) to win more foreign aid. Time, perhaps, for Australia to build a few nice, long wharves. ?","China and the Pacific

Flush with cash, the prime minister pitches for political salvation
JUST two months ago Malcolm Turnbull came within a whisker of winning parliament's approval for his most cherished policy: cutting the corporate tax rate from 30% to 25% over ten years. At the last minute he failed to secure a couple of votes in the Senate, where his conservative government lacks a majority. Undeterred, on May 8th the prime minister made tax cuts the centrepiece of his government's budget for the coming fiscal year. As well as lowering rates for business, it also included cuts in personal income tax. Mr Turnbull, whose government has long trailed Labor, the main opposition, in opinion polls, hopes his tax strategy will reverse his fortunes at a federal election due next year.
Among rich countries, Australia has lagged in cutting corporate taxes. It last did so 17 years ago. The Business Council of Australia, a lobby group, complains that the rate is ""frozen in time"" compared with the American one of 21%, which is also the average in Asia. The Treasury worries that Australia risks becoming ""increasingly uncompetitive internationally"".
Business taxes are Australia's biggest source of revenue after personal income tax. Revenue from both is buoyant, thanks largely to rising employment and mining profits (see chart on next page). The economy is entering its 27th year of unbroken growth. After years of deficits, a balanced budget is in sight next fiscal year and a surplus a year later. A former banker and businessman, Mr Turnbull proposed a corporate-tax cut at the previous election, in 2016. He argued it would pep up the economy by encouraging businesses to invest and hire more. There was ""no question"", he said. ""You'll see a rise in wages with a reduction in company tax.""
Mr Turnbull has struck an even bolder note with his income-tax cuts. They are worth about A$140bn ($104bn) over a decade, almost twice as much as the cor- porate cuts. The government proposes ditching a 37% tax rate that kicks in on earnings over A$87,000, which would leave 94% of taxpayers handing over just under a third of their incomes in tax. But Labor has suggested it may not support the full plan.
The business-tax cuts, too, still face a rocky legislative road. Parliament has already approved them, but only for firms with annual turnovers of A$50m or less. When the government reintroduced the plan in March, it needed the votes of just two independent senators to extend the cuts to all businesses. One of them, Tim Storer, an economist, argued the cuts were too ""narrowly cast"" and called for broader tax reform. He remains unconvinced.
Another complication stems from a royal commission Mr Turnbull reluctantly set up in December to look into misconduct at banks and financial-services firms. Revelations of shabby treatment of customers have hurt the industry's image. Derryn Hinch, a former journalist whose Senate vote the government also needs, wants banks excluded from any business-tax cut. To include them, he says, is ""not only immoral, it's politically suicidal"".
Some question the claimed economic benefits of corporate-tax cuts. Saul Eslake, an economist, compares Australia with Canada, which has cut its corporate-tax rate by more than the Turnbull government proposes. Mr Eslake calculates that investment and wages have risen by more in Australia than in Canada since Canada began to cut tax rates in 2000. A survey of some 130 corporate bosses by the Business Council of Australia, leaked in March, bears out his doubts. Less than a fifth said they would increase wages and hiring as a result of a tax cut. Most said their priority would be capital investment and increasing returns to shareholders.
A recent opinion poll showed greater public support for cutting debt than cutting taxes. At A$34ibn, or 18.6% of gdp, Australia's net debt is quite low by global standards. Mr Turnbull is convinced that voters will thank him for lowering their bills-if he can persuade the Senate to do so.","Australia 's budget

Three people were shot and killed by the army in Zimbabwe just hours after the electoral commission announced that the ruling Zanu-PF had won a majority in parliament in the first elections since a coup removed Robert Mugabe last year. The supposedly neutral commission is taking time to release the results of the presidential election.
Three Russian journalists were killed in the Central African Republic, apparently while investigating the activities of a Russian private military company, Wagner, that has deployed troops in the country and is helping to train its armed forces.
Jean-Pierre Bemba, a former warlord, returned to the Democratic Republic of Congo to contest presidential elections later this year. He was freed from prison in The Hague after the International Criminal Court overturned his conviction for war crimes.
Iran's economy continued to struggle, as the value of the rial sunk to a new low against the dollar. Nevertheless, Iranian officials rejected Donald Trump's offer of talks without preconditions.

Nothing to be proud of
The number of murders in Mexico increased by 27% last year to a record 31,174, according to the country's statistics institute. It had earlier said there were a little over 25,000 homicides in 2017. The murder rate of 25 peri00,000 people is also the highest on record.
Venezuela's ruling United Socialist Party re-elected the country's president, Nicolás Maduro, as its leader in a conference that took place during a blackout. Mr Maduro, who normally blames the country's economic woes on ""imperialism"", accepted responsibility for the distress. ""Enough with whining,"" he said.

Imran Khan began talking to smaller parties about forming a governing coalition in Pakistan after his Tehreek-eInsaf party won the most seats in the National Assembly. The losing Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz and the Pakistan Peoples Party backed away from pressing their claim that the election had been rigged by security officials. Meanwhile, Pakistan was reported to be preparing to ask the IMF for a bail-out, but America said it would oppose such a deal if it was used to pay off Chinese loans.
In Cambodia Hun Sen won another term as prime minister, an unsurprising result given that the main opposition party was barred from running in the election. Hun Sen has been in power since 1985. The vote was widely condemned.
Lu Wei, once China's top internet regulator, was charged with taking bribes. Prosecutors said that he abused his position and accepted a ""huge amount of money and property"". Mr Lu had risen to great heights under Xi Jinping, gaining deferential treatment from Silicon Valley chieftains such as Mark Zuckerberg. This year the Communist Party expelled him, saying he had been ""tyrannical"" and ""shameless"".
Google was reportedly developing a censored version of its search engine for China. It was said to have been working in secret on a censored-search app since last year, and to have demonstrated it to Chinese officials. Google left China in 2010 to uphold its old motto, ""Don't be evil"".
Australia's Labor Party won four of five by-elections held on the same day. The fifth was won by an independent candidate. The results leave the ruling Liberal-National coalition headed by Malcolm Turnbull with a one-seat majority in Parliament. A general election must be held before N ovember 2019.
Abu Sayyaf, an Islamist group, was thought to be behind a van bomb that killed ten people at a military checkpoint on the southern Philippine island ofBasilan. The attack happened a few days after Rodrigo Duterte, the president, signed a law granting autonomy to Muslims in the south.
Data from the University of Maryland showed that the number of terrorist attacks dropped by a fifth in 2017. Deaths related to terror attacks fell by 25%. The worst affected countries were Iraq, Afghanistan, India, Pakistan and the Philippines. Their share of attacks increased from 50% in 2015 to 57% last year. Islamic State and the Taliban were to blame for a fifth of all attacks and nearly half of all deaths, a total of12,045 people.
A game of chicken
Michel Barnier, the Eu's Brexit negotiator, issued a lukewarm response to the British government's latest proposals on customs and the Irish border. British ministers stepped up their warnings that European intransigence could see Britain crashing out of the eu without a deal when it leaves in March.
A war of words erupted between Turkey and the United States over Andrew Brunson, an evangelical pastor who has been detained in Izmir since 2016 on questionable charges. Mr Brunson was released from prison but placed under house arrest. America imposed financial sanctions on two Turkish ministers in response.
On their way home
North Korea handed over the remains of 55 American servicemen killed during the Korean war to American authorities. Donald Trump thanked the regime for returning the remains, a concession that was agreed to at a summit between Mr Trump and Kim JongUn, the North's dictator, in June. The remains will be examined by a forensics team in Hawaii for identification. In 1990 the remains of what were thought to be five American soldiers returned by North Korea turned out to be seven.
Paul Manafort, Mr Trump's former campaign manager, went on trial for fraud. He is accused of laundering money from his work for pro-Russian politicians in Ukraine and then avoiding tax. It is the first trial examining alleged links between Trump aides and Russian interests to stem from the investigation led by Robert Mueller, the special counsel.
The start of Mr Manafort's trial seemed to rattle Mr Trump. He publicly called on Jeff Sessions, the attorney-general, to end the Mueller investigation (something that Republicans have repeatedly warned him not to do), despite Mr Sessions having recused himself from the inquiry.
Mr Trump also threatened to shut down the government unless Congress fully funds his border wall with Mexico.
Business
Diverging from other central banks that have moved to unwind their stimulus programmes, the Bank of Japan said it was committed to keeping interest rates ""extremely low"" for the foreseeable future, and pledged to continue buying bonds. Haruhiko Kuroda, the central bank's governor, said the forward guidance should ""counter speculation... that the bank is heading towards an early exit or an increase in rates"".
The Federal Reserve kept its benchmark interest rate on hold at its policy meeting. But with the American economy growing by an annualised rate of 4.1% in the second quarter, its best performance since the middle of 2014, the Fed is widely expected to increase rates in September. The Bank of England raised its main rate for the first time since November (and only the second time since 2007) by a quarter of a percentage point, to 0.75%.
Turkey's central bank raised its forecast for the country's inflation rate this year to 13.4%, from the 8.4% it had predicted in April. A weak lira has pushed up prices, but the central bank has not raised interest rates by much in response.
gdp in the euro zone expanded by 0.3% in the second quarter compared with the previous three months. That was the slowest rate of growth by that measure in two years, raising concerns that the prospect of an escalating trade war with America might be hurting the region's exports.
Political interference
Facebook said that it had closed down several disinformation accounts on its sites that were set up to disrupt the mid-term elections. Although smaller in scale than the attempt to influence the presidential election in 2016, it is thought that this was a similar Russian campaign to sow discord. However, the latest attack was more sophisticated, using virtual private networks to try to avoid detection.
Twitter's share price slumped after it reported that the number of monthly active users to its platform had fallen by 1m in the second quarter compared with the previous three months. And Netflix's share price took another hammering; it recently reported a shortfall in adding new subscribers. This came after Facebook took a drubbing in the markets when it revealed similarly disappointing user growth.
By contrast, Apple beat expectations with its quarterly earnings report. Revenue was up by 17% compared with the same thre e months last year, to $53.3bn, boosted by the higher price it charges for the iPhone x (sales of total iPhone units only increased by 1%). Net profit rose by a third, to $11.5bn.
A rescue deal to save House of Fraser fell through when the Chinese firm backing the arrangement pulled out following a steep fall in its share price. That leaves the future of the British chain of department stores in doubt.
Bumper Profit
After years of retrenchment following the Deepwater Horizon disaster, bp reported a hefty jump in headline profit for the second quarter, to $2.8bn. The energy giant is increasing its dividend for the first time in four years. It is also undertaking its biggest acquisition in two decades by agreeing to buy bhp's shale assets in America for $10.5bn.
With its income buoyed by higher commodity prices, Rio Tinto announced a package of returns to shareholders worth $7.2bn. The mining company reported an underlying halfyear profit of $4.4bn.
Fidelity surprised its rivals by becoming the first big investment firm to launch new index-tracking stock funds with no fees for investors. It also slashed the charges on its existing funds. The announcement underscores fee competition in the industry as it moves away from a reliance on the expertise of stock-pickers towards low-cost, index-based funds.
bmw raised the price of sportutility vehicles it sells in China to offset some of the cost of the retaliatory tariffs that China imposed on American car imports. bmw makes its suv models for export to the country at a factory in South Carolina, though it is ramping up production in China. Tesla, which has also raised the price of its cars in China, reported a quarterly loss of $717.5m. Butit pleased investors by burning less cash than had been expected and by promising to turn a profit later this year.
Time to put your phone down
A range of tools were unveiled for the Facebook and Instagram platforms that will enable users to limit the time they spend engrossed on their apps. Concerns about addiction to social media are on the rise; surveys have revealed that on average people check their phones 50 times a day. The tools require a degree of discipline by users to be effective. But if users had that discipline, perhaps they would notneed time-limiting tools.

Mr Brunson was released from prison but placed under house arrest. America imposed financial sanctions on two Turkish ministers in response.
On their way home
North Korea handed over the remains of 55 American servicemen killed during the Korean war to American authorities. Donald Trump thanked the regime for returning the remains, a concession that was agreed to at a summit between Mr Trump and Kim JongUn, the North's dictator, in June. The remains will be examined by a forensics team in Hawaii for identification. In 1990 the remains of what were thought to be five American soldiers returned by North Korea turned out to be seven.
Paul Manafort, Mr Trump's former campaign manager, went on trial for fraud. He is accused of laundering money from his work for pro-Russian politicians in Ukraine and then avoiding tax. It is the first trial examining alleged links between Trump aides and Russian interests to stem from the investigation led by Robert Mueller, the special counsel.
The start of Mr Manafort's trial seemed to rattle Mr Trump. He publicly called on Jeff Sessions, the attorney-general, to end the Mueller investigation (something that Republicans have repeatedly warned him not to do), despite Mr Sessions having recused himself from the inquiry.
Mr Trump also threatened to shut down the government unless Congress fully funds his border wall with Mexico.
Business
Diverging from other central banks that have moved to unwind their stimulus programmes, the Bank of Japan said it was committed to keeping interest rates ""extremely low"" for the foreseeable future, and pledged to continue buying bonds. Haruhiko Kuroda, the central bank's governor, said the forward guidance should ""counter speculation... that the bank is heading towards an early exit or an increase in rates"".
The Federal Reserve kept its benchmark interest rate on hold at its policy meeting. But with the American economy growing by an annualised rate of 4.1% in the second quarter, its best performance since the middle of 2014, the Fed is widely expected to increase rates in September. The Bank of England raised its main rate for the first time since November (and only the second time since 2007) by a quarter of a percentage point, to 0.75%.
Turkey's central bank raised its forecast for the country's inflation rate this year to 13.4%, from the 8.4% it had predicted in April. A weak lira has pushed up prices, but the central bank has not raised interest rates by much in response.
gdp in the euro zone expanded by 0.3% in the second quarter compared with the previous three months. That was the slowest rate of growth by that measure in two years, raising concerns that the prospect of an escalating trade war with America might be hurting the region's exports.
Political interference
Facebook said that it had closed down several disinformation accounts on its sites that were set up to disrupt the mid-term elections. Although smaller in scale than the attempt to influence the presidential election in 2016, it is thought that this was a similar Russian campaign to sow discord. However, the latest attack was more sophisticated, using virtual private networks to try to avoid detection.
Twitter's share price slumped after it reported that the number of monthly active users to its platform had fallen by 1m in the second quarter compared with the previous three months. And Netflix's share price took another hammering; it recently reported a shortfall in adding new subscribers. This came after Facebook took a drubbing in the markets when it revealed similarly disappointing user growth.
By contrast, Apple beat expectations with its quarterly earnings report. Revenue was up by 17% compared with the same thre e months last year, to $53.3bn, boosted by the higher price it charges for the iPhone x (sales of total iPhone units only increased by 1%). Net profit rose by a third, to $11.5bn.
A rescue deal to save House of Fraser fell through when the Chinese firm backing the arrangement pulled out following a steep fall in its share price. That leaves the future of the British chain of department stores in doubt.
Bumper Profit
After years of retrenchment following the Deepwater Horizon disaster, bp reported a hefty jump in headline profit for the second quarter, to $2.8bn. The energy giant is increasing its dividend for the first time in four years. It is also undertaking its biggest acquisition in two decades by agreeing to buy bhp's shale assets in America for $10.5bn.
With its income buoyed by higher commodity prices, Rio Tinto announced a package of returns to shareholders worth $7.2bn. The mining company reported an underlying halfyear profit of $4.4bn.
Fidelity surprised its rivals by becoming the first big investment firm to launch new index-tracking stock funds with no fees for investors. It also slashed the charges on its existing funds. The announcement underscores fee competition in the industry as it moves away from a reliance on the expertise of stock-pickers towards low-cost, index-based funds.
bmw raised the price of sportutility vehicles it sells in China to offset some of the cost of the retaliatory tariffs that China imposed on American car imports. bmw makes its suv models for export to the country at a factory in South Carolina, though it is ramping up production in China. Tesla, which has also raised the price of its cars in China, reported a quarterly loss of $717.5m. Butit pleased investors by burning less cash than had been expected and by promising to turn a profit later this year.
Time to put your phone down
A range of tools were unveiled for the Facebook and Instagram platforms that will enable users to limit the time they spend engrossed on their apps. Concerns about addiction to social media are on the rise; surveys have revealed that on average people check their phones 50 times a day. The tools require a degree of discipline by users to be effective. But if users had that discipline, perhaps they would notneed time-limiting tools.

As the American-led, rules-based world order apparently fragments, coalitions of the like-minded are forming to help reinforce it
FOR the past four years senior officials from a group of leading democracies, calling themselves the ""dio"", have quietly been meeting once or twice a year to discuss how to co-ordinate strategies to advance the liberal world order. Foreign ministry policy-planners and a few think-tank types would discuss responses to Russia, China, North Korea, Iran-but largely below the radar, so as not to be seen as a cabal of the ""old West"". The idea has been to enhance co-operation among ""a small number of strategically like-minded and highly capable states"", as Ash Jain, a former member of the State Department's policy-planning staff, put it in a working paper in 2013.
But, at their next meeting, in Seoul in September, the dio (America, Britain, France, Germany, Italy, Canada, Japan, Australia and South Korea, plus the European Union) will have a new agenda item: America's global role. Whereas the main threat to the rules-based order used to come from outside the leading democracies, some now fear it comes from within.
President Donald Trump's hostilities on trade, his attacks on the policies of nato allies and ditching of international agreements, such as the Paris climate accord and the Iran nuclear deal, have led even some of America's closest partners to conclude that he wants to wreck the American-led world order forged after the second world war. Mr Trump himself has called the eu a ""foe"" on trade. Donald Tusk, president of the European Council, has spoken bluntly of trans-Atlantic relations: ""With friends like that, who needs enemies?""
An overreaction, perhaps. Defenders of Mr Trump's strategy say he is seeking not to bury the rules-based order but to reinvigorate it, by questioning the role of institutions that have become inefficient or ineffective. As supporting evidence, they can point to the ceasefire declared on July 25th in the trade war with Europe. Others suggest that things might revert to normal when someone new is in the White House.
Yet it would be risky to rely on the hope that Trumpism will pass. American ambivalence about multilateralism is not new. George W. Bush, for example, in his first year as president pulled back from half a dozen international agreements, including the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty and the Kyoto protocol on climate change.
Around the world, the view that the change is both deep and lasting is gaining ground. A mere 9% of Germans think America under Mr Trump is a reliable partner for the security of Europe, according to a recent poll by zdf Politbarometer. In Australia annual polling by the Lowy Institute, a think-tank, shows a 28-point fall since 2011 in the share of people who trust America to act responsibly; at 55%, trust in America is at a historic low, only just ahead of trust in China (52%). ""The order we have known for the past 70 years has ended,"" according to Allan Gyngell, a former head of Australia's Office of National Assessments, Australia's main intelligence agency. ""It's not changing. It's over.""
The dio framework ""takes on even greater meaning at this time of uncertainty surrounding America's global role,"" believes Mr Jain, who runs the dio initiative at the Atlantic Council, an American thinktank, in partnership with a Canadian counterpart, the Centre for International Governance Innovation. The liberal order it stands for has always been an amorphous concept. Now that it is at risk, huddling together both to define and defend it becomes more urgent. The dio group is part of a broader trend of intensifying efforts to rally the ""like-minded"" to that end. Mr Trump's America First approach is prompting policymakers from Canberra to Ottawa to cast around for coalitions to limit the damage of his onslaughts and, eventually perhaps, fill gaps left by an American retreat from its global role.
Crudely, these efforts to rally the likeminded come in four varieties. The first in volves appealing to Americans beyond the Trump administration. Diplomats in Washington, dc, say defenders of the liberal order need to build support in Congress and to get on planes to other parts of the country and explain why the system Mr Trump is undermining has served America well. ""Europeans need to engage, engage, engage: with Congress, with governors, with America's business community and civil society,"" wrote Wolfgang Ischinger, a former German ambassador who chairs the annual Munich Security Conference, in the New York Times on July 22nd.
Canada has been the most energetic in pursuing this strategy. Its ministers, mayors and diplomats have mounted a concerted effort at state and local level to draw attention to the American jobs and industries that depend on trade with Canada. This did not stop Mr Trump from slapping hefty metals tariffs on Canada and calling Justin Trudeau, its prime minister, ""dishonest and weak"" after the recent Gy summit he hosted. Canada's ""smooth"" diplomacy, and the resulting stream of representations on its behalf to the White House, may even have ended up irking Mr Trump. Canadians must hope that in the long term the bottom-up approach will pay off.
But relying on popular support in America for its global role might be too optimistic. So a second approach to convening the like-minded-with a broader, international focus-is also being tried. Like a Davos for the once-powerful, this mission is attracting gaggles of global grandees, as ex-presidents, former prime ministers and retired diplomats lend their weight to the effort to save the world they used to run.
The Dio process has spawned a new, wider enterprise, called the Democratic Order Initiative, that seeks to engage the public behind support for the international rules-based system. Launched on June 23rd in Berlin by the Atlantic Council, with backing from Madeleine Albright (a former secretary of state), Stephen Hadley (a former American national-security adviser), Carl Bildt (a former prime minister and foreign minister of Sweden) and Yoriko Kawaguchi (a former Japanese foreign minister), it aims to articulate core principles of the rules-based order and mobilise public and official backing for them.
In the same vein, the Alliance of Democracies Foundation was set up last year to ""strengthen the spines"" of the world's democracies. A brainchild of Anders Fogh Rasmussen, a former Danish prime minister and nato secretary-general, it held an inaugural ""Democracy Summit"" in June and envisages annual winter gatherings in Colorado, as well as summer ones in Copenhagen. In the absence of clear ideological leadership from the White House, says Mr Rasmussen, the rest of the free world needs to advance and defend democracy.
The first initiative of the foundation's global ""campaign for democracy"" is a Transatlantic Commission on Election Integrity, to bolster defences against outside interference. It is co-chaired by Mr Rasmussen and Michael Chertoff, a former secretary of homeland security in America; Joe Biden, America's former vice-president, is among the other 13 commissioners. They have urgent work to do. Mr Rasmussen points out that 20 elections will be held across eu and nato countries between now and the next American presidential contest in November 2020.
Characteristically, it is France's ""Jupiterian"" president, Emmanuel Macron, who has the most ambitious project. His Paris Peace Forum, to be held on November 11th-13th, is envisaged as an annual event bringing together governments and civic groups to discuss the world's problems. The idea is to show that ""there is still a constituency for collective action, among states and civil society...beyond populism and interstate tensions.""
Mr Macron wants ideas from all sorts of organisations, including governments, business associations, ngos, trade unions, religious groups and think-tanks. The model is COP21, the summit in 2015 that produced the Paris accord on climate change. Mr Trump has decided to pull America out of that agreement, which is itself an example of the third variety of effort behind likemindedness: keeping international deals alive in America's absence.
No country has followed America in abandoning the Paris accord. All the other 194 signatories are sticking with it, and hope America will one day rejoin the fold. Within America, state governments, cities and businesses have in many cases committed themselves to carbon reductions in the spirit of Paris.
European attempts to keep the Iran nuclear deal alive without America are proving trickier. The Trump administration wants to maximise economic pressure on the Iranian regime, and is threatening sanctions on international companies doing business with the country. Without the incentive of closer business ties to support its struggling economy, Iran could decide to abandon the nuclear self-restraint at the heart of the deal.
However, the 12-country Trans-Pacific Partnership, a trade deal intended to set free-market rules for the region's trade before China's influence becomes overwhelming, has defied expectations. It has reinvented itself as an 11-country grouping after America, by far the biggest partner, decided to pull out when Mr Trump became president. Renamed the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership (tpp), it was signed in March in Chile and is expected to come into force around the end of this year, once at least six countries have ratified it. Similarly, some hope that, should Mr Trump's distaste for the multilateral trading system lead to America's quitting the World Trade Organisation, the global body could carry on without it.
Groping for groupings
Japan and Australia led efforts to keep the tpp alive. Both countries are also active in the fourth way of clubbing together: new coalitions between like-minded countries in the pursuit of shared interests, from trade to defence. On July 17th Japan signed a free-trade deal with the European Union, eliminating most tariffs and creating the world's largest open economic area, covering over 600m people and nearly a third of global GDP. Negotiations quickened in response to America's trade threats. Shinzo Abe, Japan's prime minister, said at the signing ceremony in Tokyo that the deal ""shows the world the unshaken political will of Japan and the eu to lead the world as the champions of free trade at a time when protectionism has spread.""
Australia has historically relied on a culturally similar foreign ally to guarantee regional security: first Britain, then America. China's rise and America's inward turn are concentrating minds. In ""Without America: Australia in the new Asia"", an essay published last November, Hugh White of Australian National University (anu) predicts a not-too-distant future in which China is Asia's dominant power. But how to respond? ""Our best hope"", suggests Michael Wesley, also of anu, writing in Australian Foreign Affairs, ""is not for some grand coalition to balance China but for each of China's larger neighbours to assert its interests when they are challenged.""
In the absence of a grand coalition, smaller ones may play a role in resisting an over-mighty China. In January when Australia's prime minister, Malcolm Turnbull, visited Japan, the two countries pledged to deepen and broaden defence co-opera- tion. A ""reciprocal access agreement"" is being concluded to allow joint military exercises. In July Australia, Japan and India held high-level trilateral talks in New Delhi, raising the possibility of joint naval exercises. Another trio involving Australia, includes France as well as India. In a speech at a naval base in Sydney in May, Mr Macron called for a ""Paris-Delhi-Canberra axis"" to become an established regional structure, with France, India and Australia defining a joint strategy for the Indo-Pacific. ""If we want to be seen and respected by China as an equal partner,"" he said, ""we must organise ourselves."" He envisages regular trilateral talks between foreign and defence ministers.
Back in Europe, the French president is also trying to bring the like-minded together on defence. His European Intervention Initiative (eii for short) was signed into existence by nine countries, including Britain and Germany, in June. The idea is to improve strategic co-operation so that coalitions of willing European countries can be ready for joint action in crises, if need be without America.
Such coalitions raise many questions. One concerns their effectiveness. Innovations such as the eii may be good ideas, but the gap between strategic dialogue and coalitions in a military operational sense is a wide one. For that, points out François Heisbourg of the Geneva Centre for Security Policy, you need both interoperability and agility. ""You can't just improvise, you have to have it built up.""
Does size matter?
Another reservation relates to the groups' scale. Do they really amount to much? Even if they club together, for example, it is hard for other countries to match China's clout in Asia. And there is no real substitute for America's overall influence and power. The country spends more on defence than the next seven countries combined, produces 23% of global gdp (measured atmarket exchange rates) and has the world's dominant currency. Still, Mr Rasmussen believes that a joint effort can make a difference while Mr Trump is president. ""A group of midsized and wealthy democracies could join forces and protect the rulesbased world order.""
How ""like-minded"" do countries need to be to work together? Canada and 16 Latin American countries have formed the ""Lima Group"" backing a restoration of democracy in Venezuela. They have blocked regional recognition of Venezuela's vote for a Constituent Assembly last year and of a sham presidential election in May. Now, however, some wonder whether Mexico will retain its like-mindedness when Andrés Manuel López Obrador takes over as president in December, and whether Brazil will after its election in October.
Even in Europe, despite decades of working towards ""ever-closer union"", discerning who is really like-minded is becoming harder, as populist forces have gained influence. In Italy, for example, the Five Star Movement that is now the largest party in the country's coalition government has threatened to block the eu's freetrade agreement with Canada. ""Before thinking of defending the liberal order globally there's a problem of defending it within the eu,"" says Marta Dassu, of the Aspen Institute Italia.
In some cases, hard-headedness may be just as important as like-mindedness. A lot depends on what the common approach is trying to achieve. In the words of Donald Rumsfeld, when he was America's defence secretary at the time of the invasion of Afghanistan in 2001, ""the mission determines the coalition.""
Sometimes it may be enough to be only partially like-minded, in pursuit of a common interest. China, for example, is seeking to make common cause with the European Union in defence of the global trading order that has served both well. At a summit meeting with the European Union in Beijing in July President Xi Jinping said they should ""join hands to defend multilateralism and a rules-based freetrade system"". The two sides issued a joint communiqué supporting the system, something that had eluded them in their two previous summits. It suits the Europeans to flirt with China, to show America that they should not be taken for granted.
Still, without common values, co-operation is likely to remain limited. The Europeans are far more worried about Mr Xi's authoritarian ways than about Mr Trump's tendencies-and they share Mr Trump's objections to China's own mercantilist policies. For Europe, ""the temptation to enroll China into the like-minded is very dangerous,"" warns Ms Dassu.
China shows that not all initiatives of the like-minded involve champions of the liberal order. It has become an institutional entrepreneur in an effort to shape the world to suit its interests. China has founded bodies such as the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank, the ""16+1"" gathering of 16 central and eastern European countries plus China, and the world's largest regional grouping (in terms of its members' combined population), the Shanghai Co-operation Organisation (bringing together China, India, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Pakistan, Russia, Tajikistan and Uzbekistan). And Mr Xi's flagship project is the Belt and Road Initiative, a sweeping plan to build infrastructure along China's trade routes.
As America retreats, expect China to cultivate such networks even more energetically. ""The world is moving towards multipolarity,"" Mr Xi told the recent summit of the brics (Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa) in Johannesburg. He appealed to a shared interest among this group in the evolution of the global governance system, championing the development of emerging markets. ""We brics countries should...play a constructive role in building a new type of international relations,"" he said.
The next few years are likely to see a boom in what might be called the likemindedness industry. In the short term this is unlikely to impinge much on Mr Trump's solipsistic world-view, let alone to alter his America First course. Other countries' plurilateral initiatives will mostly be beneath his notice. But he might fight back against those that succeed in directly thwarting his intentions. The most obvious danger of a clash is over Iran, should the other parties to the nuclear deal manage to keep it afloat despite his attempt to scuttle it.
Like startups in the business world, many new coalitions of the like-minded will fail. But some could flourish. Mr Gyngell predicts that the current ""hub and spoke"" order will give way to a power grid in which ""networks and links will be ever more important."" This effervescent, entrepreneurial period in global affairs could help to save the existing world order-or start to shape a new one. £","Saving the world order

For that, points out François Heisbourg of the Geneva Centre for Security Policy, you need both interoperability and agility. ""You can't just improvise, you have to have it built up.""
Does size matter?
Another reservation relates to the groups' scale. Do they really amount to much? Even if they club together, for example, it is hard for other countries to match China's clout in Asia. And there is no real substitute for America's overall influence and power. The country spends more on defence than the next seven countries combined, produces 23% of global gdp (measured atmarket exchange rates) and has the world's dominant currency. Still, Mr Rasmussen believes that a joint effort can make a difference while Mr Trump is president. ""A group of midsized and wealthy democracies could join forces and protect the rulesbased world order.""
How ""like-minded"" do countries need to be to work together? Canada and 16 Latin American countries have formed the ""Lima Group"" backing a restoration of democracy in Venezuela. They have blocked regional recognition of Venezuela's vote for a Constituent Assembly last year and of a sham presidential election in May. Now, however, some wonder whether Mexico will retain its like-mindedness when Andrés Manuel López Obrador takes over as president in December, and whether Brazil will after its election in October.
Even in Europe, despite decades of working towards ""ever-closer union"", discerning who is really like-minded is becoming harder, as populist forces have gained influence. In Italy, for example, the Five Star Movement that is now the largest party in the country's coalition government has threatened to block the eu's freetrade agreement with Canada. ""Before thinking of defending the liberal order globally there's a problem of defending it within the eu,"" says Marta Dassu, of the Aspen Institute Italia.
In some cases, hard-headedness may be just as important as like-mindedness. A lot depends on what the common approach is trying to achieve. In the words of Donald Rumsfeld, when he was America's defence secretary at the time of the invasion of Afghanistan in 2001, ""the mission determines the coalition.""
Sometimes it may be enough to be only partially like-minded, in pursuit of a common interest. China, for example, is seeking to make common cause with the European Union in defence of the global trading order that has served both well. At a summit meeting with the European Union in Beijing in July President Xi Jinping said they should ""join hands to defend multilateralism and a rules-based freetrade system"". The two sides issued a joint communiqué supporting the system, something that had eluded them in their two previous summits. It suits the Europeans to flirt with China, to show America that they should not be taken for granted.
Still, without common values, co-operation is likely to remain limited. The Europeans are far more worried about Mr Xi's authoritarian ways than about Mr Trump's tendencies-and they share Mr Trump's objections to China's own mercantilist policies. For Europe, ""the temptation to enroll China into the like-minded is very dangerous,"" warns Ms Dassu.
China shows that not all initiatives of the like-minded involve champions of the liberal order. It has become an institutional entrepreneur in an effort to shape the world to suit its interests. China has founded bodies such as the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank, the ""16+1"" gathering of 16 central and eastern European countries plus China, and the world's largest regional grouping (in terms of its members' combined population), the Shanghai Co-operation Organisation (bringing together China, India, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Pakistan, Russia, Tajikistan and Uzbekistan). And Mr Xi's flagship project is the Belt and Road Initiative, a sweeping plan to build infrastructure along China's trade routes.
As America retreats, expect China to cultivate such networks even more energetically. ""The world is moving towards multipolarity,"" Mr Xi told the recent summit of the brics (Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa) in Johannesburg. He appealed to a shared interest among this group in the evolution of the global governance system, championing the development of emerging markets. ""We brics countries should...play a constructive role in building a new type of international relations,"" he said.
The next few years are likely to see a boom in what might be called the likemindedness industry. In the short term this is unlikely to impinge much on Mr Trump's solipsistic world-view, let alone to alter his America First course. Other countries' plurilateral initiatives will mostly be beneath his notice. But he might fight back against those that succeed in directly thwarting his intentions. The most obvious danger of a clash is over Iran, should the other parties to the nuclear deal manage to keep it afloat despite his attempt to scuttle it.
Like startups in the business world, many new coalitions of the like-minded will fail. But some could flourish. Mr Gyngell predicts that the current ""hub and spoke"" order will give way to a power grid in which ""networks and links will be ever more important."" This effervescent, entrepreneurial period in global affairs could help to save the existing world order-or start to shape a new one. £",900,Australia,cb-900-3,,False,,0,True

New Zealand bemoans Australia's deportation regime
NEW ZEALAND'S deputy prime minister, Winston Peters, knows how to stir the pot. In the midst of a diplomatic tiff with his country's biggest and usually chummiest neighbour, he suggested that Australia was in need of a new flag. Its current one, he complained, too closely ""copied"" New Zealand's. Since the two ensigns are so similar, Australia's should be the one to change. (Australia's flag was designed first, but was formally adopted a year later than New Zealand's, in 1903.) Mr Peters, who recently served as interim prime minister while Jacinda Ardern was on maternity leave, has a solution: an enormous kangaroo, ""like the maple leaf in Canada"".
The tiff is over Australia's increasing deportations of New Zealanders. In 2014 a conservative prime minister, Tony Abbott, tightened deportation rules. Any foreigner sentenced to a year in jail now fails a ""character test"" and has to leave the country. Kiwis may live and work freely in Australia. Since about 650,000 do so, the rule hits them the hardest. Since the law was changed, at least 1,200 New Zealanders have been cast back across the Tasman Sea. OzKiwi, an advocacy group, estimates that around 170 New Zealanders are currently in detention centres awaiting deportation, more than any other nationality.
Australia makes no concessions for those who came as children but never changed their passports. Neither does it for juvenile offenders, or petty criminals with short sentences that cumulatively add up to 12 months, even if those were suspended. Historic crimes were once ignored, but the law now works retroactively, counting ancient infringements committed overseas as well as recent ones in Australia.
Some prior offenders are stopped at airports. Australian authorities catch others, like Tommy Murray, a former biker, inside the country. He did four stints behind bars for crimes including drugs and burglary before moving to Australia. He says he lived law-abidingly for 16 years and paid A$1.2m ($890,000) in tax before his past caught up with him. In detention, he argues he was refused much-needed medication, then booted out without being able to see his family. ""My country treated him barbarically,"" says his Australian wife Sara, who followed him.
New Zealand politicians periodically grumble about Australian deportations, but the political mood between the two countries soured markedly when a 17-yearold was recently thrown into an adult detention centre in Melbourne. The deportations had ""a venal political strain"" to them, said New Zealand's justice minister, Andrew Little; Australia ""doesn't look like our best friend, our nearest neighbour."" Australia, Mr Peters added, was in breach of the un convention on children's rights.
The 17-year-old has since been released, but critics also raise questions about racial fairness. New Zealanders of Maori or Pacific Islander descent are disproportionately affected by the changes, because they are more likely than average to have convictions. About 60% of New Zealanders who have been deported from Australia since 2014 are ""brown"", as Joanne Cox of Oz Kiwi puts it. Citizenship is reserved mostly for the skilled and relatively wealthy: only about 8.4% of New Zealanders who arrived in Australia in the decade after 2001 got passports. The rate for Maoris was below 3%.
Paul Hamer, a researcher at Victoria University of Wellington, in New Zealand's capital, suggests that Australia's souring mood has been fed by ""dissatisfaction"" at New Zealand's openness to Pacific migration. It threw open its doors to the region at a time when Australia still banned all but white immigrants (today it sets annual quotas for newcomers from the Pacific). People of Pacific Islander descent are 8% of New Zealand's population. Politicians in Canberra, the Australian capital, have complained for decades that such migrants exploit a ""backdoor"" to Australia.
Its conservative coalition government under Malcolm Turnbull is so concerned about border control that last year it rebuffed New Zealand's offer to resettle asylum-seekers from detention centres run for Australia's benefit in Nauru, a tiny Pacific island state, and Manus island, part of Papua New Guinea. Almost 1,600 ""boat people"" remain in the controversial camps, with no idea of when they might be released. Australia's opposition leader, Bill Shorten, says he would reconsider the New Zealand proposal if his Labor party wins the general election that must be held in the coming year. But not, he adds, before dealing with the issue of their onward movement.","An Antipodean tiff

Two of Donald Trump's closest former advisers were convicted in separate court cases on a raft of charges. Michael Cohen, the president's erstwhile personal lawyer, struck a plea-bargain deal with federal prosecutors and admitted that he had paid off two women claiming to have had affairs with Mr Trump. Damningly, he said he did this ""in co-ordination and at the direction of"" Mr Trump (who was not named directly in the case). Paul Manafort, Mr Trump's campaign manager until August 2016, was found guilty of tax fraud. He also faces trial on charges relating to his work for pro-Russian Ukrainians.
Duncan Hunter, a Republican congressman from California, was charged with misusing campaign funds for personal use. He is the second Republican to face criminal charges this month: Chris Collins, who represents a district in upstate New York, has been indicted for insider trading.
The Trump administration ditched the Clean Power Plan, which set federal guidelines for states to reduce their carbon emissions. Under the new Affordable Clean Energy rule, states will be allowed to set less stringent standards and coal can once again be included in an ""efficient"" energy mix.
Depreciating, fast
Venezuela's president, Nicolás Maduro, announced a series of measures to shore up the economy, which is suffering from a deep depression and hyperinflation. He devalued the currency by 95% and replaced it with a new currency, the ""sovereign bolívar"", which has five fewer zeroes. He admitted that hyperinflation had been caused by printing bolívares to finance a massive budget deficit and promised a ""zero deficit"". The new currency is to be pegged to the petro, a unit of account backed by oil reserves. It began depreciating soon after its introduction.
As Venezuelans flee their country in the thousands, Ecuador introduced restrictions on Venezuelan migrants, saying they must hold a passport to enter. Around 4,000 Venezuelans are arriving at the Ecuadorean border each day, many en route to Peru and Chile. In Brazil a Venezuelan migrant camp was attacked and its occupants driven back over the border.
The youth have their say
Protests erupted in Kampala, the capital of Uganda, following the detention of five opposition mps, including Bobi Wine, who is also a popular singer. Mr Wine says the government is trying to kill him. At least one protester died when police fired tear gas and tried to remove barricades that have been erected across the city.
Kofi Annan, the seventh secretary-general of the un, died after a short illness. Mr Annan, the first sub-Saharan African to lead the organisation, sparred with America over its war in Iraq. But many will remember him for drawing attention to the plight of the poor, the sick and the victims of conflict.
Zimbabwe's Constitutional Court heard a challenge from the opposition to the recent election of President Emmerson Mnangagwa. After a delay in publishing the results, the electoral commission declared Mr Mnangagwa the winner with 51% of the vote, but the opposition says ""massive doctoring"" of the ballot has taken place. It cited identical results at 16 different polling stations as part of its evidence.
Public prosecutors in Saudi Arabia sought the death penalty for five activists, including Israa al-Ghomgham, who has highlighted discrimination against Shias. She is the first female campaigner to face execution in the kingdom. The five are accused of inciting protest, among other things.
No one is immune
The World Health Organisation warned of a ""dramatic increase in infections and extended outbreaks"" of measles in Europe. More than 41,000 children and adults contracted the disease in the first half of the year, well above the annual total for each year this decade. At least 37 people have died. Ukraine accounted for over half of those infected.
Following a damning report into child abuse by Catholic priests in Pennsylvania, Pope Francis issued a letter condemning the history of ""atrocities"" in the church. The pontiff acknowledged that ""with shame and repentance...we were not where we should have been"" when it came to supporting the victims.
Italy's hardline interior minister, Matteo Salvini, refused to allow177 refugees off an Italian ship that had rescued them at sea. In his short time in office Mr Salvini has built a reputation for being tough on migrants. He said he would give permission for the refugees to disembark once he received assurances that they would be distributed among all European Union countries.
Britain's Brexit secretary, Dominic Raab, resumed talks with the eu's negotiator, Michel Barnier. Officials are increasingly gloomy about a deal being reached in time for approval by eu leaders at a summit in mid-October. The British government published its first batch of technicaladvice papers on what would happen if there is no deal.
A smaller circle of friends
El Salvador switched its diplomatic allegiance from Taiwan to China. The defection leaves Taiwan with formal relations with just17 countries.
The Chinese Communist Party announced that it had taken measures against two senior officials in connection with a safety scandal at a vaccine-maker. A vice-governor in charge of drug safety in Jilin province, where the firm is based, has been sacked and a former deputy head of the country's food-and-drug regulator will be investigated for corruption. More than 40 government officials have also been implicated.
The Chinese foreign ministry lashed out at Andy Chan, a Hong Kong resident who has been campaigning for the territory's independence. It accused Mr Chan of ""colluding with external forces"" by calling for both China and Hong Kong to be expelled from the wto because of a ""rapid deterioration of freedoms"".
The southern Indian state of Kerala was hit by the worst monsoon floods in a century. Over 370 people have died.
Malcolm Turnbull, Australia's prime minister, offered to stand aside if a majority of mps from his party called for it. Three ministers are competing to succeed him. If he goes it will be Australia's fifth change of prime minister in a decade. 1
Business
Greece exited its third and final bail-out programme, bringing an end to eight years of economic oversight by the European Union and the imf. Other countries in the euro zone were also rescued during the debt crisis, but none compared to Greece, which received €326bn ($378bn) in total emergency assistance. To service its huge debt pile, Greece has to achieve primarybudget surpluses far into the future, which will curb state spending for years to come.
Qatar's central bank signed a $3bn currency-swap arrangement with Turkey to provide ""liquidity and support for financial stability"". The Turkish lira has taken a battering in recent weeks, in part because of a political spat with America that has resulted in sanctions on Turkish officials.
The Saudi government denied a report that the proposed ipo of Aramco, the kingdom's state-controlled oil company, has been shelved, insisting that it would go ahead when the conditions are right. Investors are losing faith in that commitment. The government has made little progress in bringing what would be the world's biggest-ever ipo to market ever since the plan was first revealed in early 2016 and it is looking at other ways to boost state coffers.
Aiming high
Target, an American retailer that two years ago was all but written off amid a slump in revenue and customers, reported its strongest growth in quarterly sales in 13 years. Customer traffic grew by 6.4% compared with the same period last year; digital sales soared by 41%. The company has restructured its business and redesigned its stores, but, like other retailers, it is also profiting from America's robust economy.
Australia banned Huawei and zte, two Chinese makers of telecoms equipment, from participating in the country's roll-out of за networks. Both companies also face severe restrictions in America based on concerns that their ties to the Chinese government pose a threat to national security, concerns which the companies say are unfounded.
Microsoft took control, through a court order, of six internet domains that were mimicking websites for the American Senate and two conservative think-tanks. The domains were created by a group, sometimes known as Fancy Bear, that is associated with the Russian government. One of the think-tanks, the Hudson Institute, has often shone a spotlight on Russian corruption. In a separate crackdown on political-misinformation campaigns, Facebook removed fake pages, groups and accounts originating from Iran and Russia that had targeted users in Latin America, Britain, the Middle East and the United States.
Getting busy with the fizzy
PepsiCo agreed to buy SodaStream for $3.2bn, continuing its expansion into healthier soft-drink products. SodaStream's water-carbonating machines, with accompanying flavours, were popular in Britain during the 1970s and 1980s. It was bought by an Israeli company in 1998 and branded as a wholesome alternative to sugary drinks.
Slack was valued at $7.1bn following its latest round of fundraising, up by 40% from its previous valuation nearly a year ago. The office messaging app is used by 8m people on a daily basis.
Following criticism from Chinese state media for not doing enough to delete banned content, Apple pulled apps from its App Store in China that offer gambling services. Betting apps are illegal in China.
In its first earnings report since going public in July, Xiaomi said revenue had increased by 68% in the second quarter, to 45bn yuan ($6.6bn), helping it turn a net profit of I4.6bn yuan.
The Chinese smartphonemaker is expanding overseas; international sales now account for over a third of revenues and it has overtaken Samsung to become India's biggest seller of smartphones. Its smart-devices business is also looking perky; sales of smart-Tvs were up by 350%.
Air France-KLM found a new chief executive. The airline said that Ben Smith would take up the position, a job that has been vacant since May after the sudden departure of JeanMarc Janaillac amid a protracted pay dispute with unions. Mr Smith, a Canadian, is the first non-Frenchman to run Air France. French unions balked at his appointment and threatened strike action.
A game of rounders
The s&P 500 index chalked up 3,453 days without entering bear territory, defined as a drop of at least 20%. Many declared it a record for a stockmarket bull run. Others questioned that, maintaining that the market stayed just out of bear territory in 1990-and that the 4,494 days from December 1987 to March 2000 constitute the true record-holder.

The country is about to lose another prime minister
WHEN it looked as if he might hold on to his job, Malcolm Turnbull, Australia's prime minister, insisted that for his fellow Liberal mps, the bedrock of the governing coalition, ""Unity is critical."" At that point, on August 2ist, he had justprecipitated and survived a vote on his own leadership. But the challenger he wrong-footed, Peter Dutton, the home-affairs minister (pictured standing), refused to give up. He began circulating a petition for another vote within the Liberal caucus, and persuaded a series of allies to resign as ministers. When it became clear that his support was crumbling, Mr Turnbull changed tone.
""I've never given in to bullies,"" the prime minister declared at a press conference, while appearing to give in. He said he would resign if Mr Dutton produced a petition from a majority of Liberal mps asking for a fresh vote-something Mr Dutton should be able to do, given all the resignations from the cabinet. ButMr Turnbull laid several traps for Mr Dutton even as he conceded. First, he delayed the vote on the next leader until August 24th, giving potential rivals to Mr Dutton a little time to rally support. Second, he asked the solicitorgeneral for an opinion about whether Mr Dutton might be ineligible to serve in parliament, given that his family trust has interests in child-care centres that receive government subsidies. That could put him in breach of a constitutional ban on mps profiting from the government they oversee. Third, Mr Turnbull said he would resign from parliament if the leadership challenge went ahead, prompting a byelection in his marginal seat. Since the government has a majority of one in the lower house (and a minority in the Senate), the new prime minister may not last long.
As The Economist went to press, Mr Turnbull seemed clearly on the way out. Mr Dutton may well prevail over the other candidates, Julie Bishop, the foreign minister, and Scott Morrison, the treasurer. For the fourth time in less than a decade, government mp s are turfing out a prime minister in search of electoral advantage.
The previous beneficiary of such a coup was Mr Turnbull himself, who unseated Tony Abbott as prime minister and Liberal leader in 2015. The opposition Labor party has also indulged in ""spill motions"", as the leadership votes are known, first evicting Kevin Rudd in 2010 in favour of Julia Gillard and then reinstating him in 2013. That did not stop Labor denouncing the current upheaval as a shameful shambles and a betrayal of the people's trust. On past precedent, the people are likely to see it that way too. None of the three previous changes of prime ministerrevived the electoral fortunes of the ruling party.
That raises the question of why Liberal mps are so busily writing a political ""suicide note"", as one of them put it. Personal grievances play a part. Mr Dutton's support comes from a hard-right faction within the Liberal caucus. Their leading light is the vengeful Mr Abbott, who thinks Mr Turnbull has dragged the party too far to the left. Mr Abbott and his allies want more restrictions on immigration and fewer on burning coal. Given the government's minuscule majority, his small band of rebels has been able to stymie the prime minister's legislative agenda.
The rebels have grown louder as successive polls have shown that the Liberal-led coalition is likely to lose the next election, due by May. The latest flashpoint was the government's unambitious proposal to trim greenhouse-gas emissions, in keeping with cuts that Mr Abbott himself approved by signing the Paris agreement on climate change. The insurrection forced Mr Turnbull to abandon the targets.
Mr Turnbull has proved a disappointing leader. He painted himself as a principled reformer, but has spent more time appeasing right-wing critics than fighting for his beliefs. By backtracking on climate change, an issue about which he professes to be passionate, he showed himself willing to jettison even his dearest policies.
Good cop or bad cop?
Yet Mr Dutton, an ex-policeman, is an unlikely alternative. As the minister most recently responsible for incarcerating asylum-seekers in foreign processing centres, he has positioned himself as one of his party's most reactionary figures. He blames black Africans for inciting gang violence, and wants to offer white South African farmers a special category of humanitarian visa. When the prime minister of the day, Kevin Rudd, apologised ten years ago to the ""stolen generation"" of aboriginal children forcibly removed from their fam-1 ilies, Mr Dutton walked out of parliament in disgust.
Australians are frustrated by stagnant wages, but they have never rallied behind right-wing populists. Polls suggest Mr Dutton is either disliked by or unknown to voters. His main appeal is tribal: he hails from Queensland, whose swing seats could determine the outcome of the election. A humiliating defeat in a by-election there last month sent Liberals into a frenzy. Mr Dutton's backers hope that his stance on immigration might win back some votes.
Yet even if they are right, the fad for spill motions makes Australian politics look alarmingly unstable. Not one prime minister has completed a three-year term since John Howard, another conservative, lost power in 2007. The new one is unlikely to buck that trend. ?

A report by the un Human Rights Council concluded that six senior generals in Myanmar should be prosecuted for genocide for leading a pogrom against Rohingya Muslims. The army has tried to deflect condemnation of its actions, but the un said the crimes were shocking for the ""level of denial, normalcy and impunity attached to them"". It also criticised Aung San Suu Kyi, Myanmar's de facto leader, for failing to prevent the atrocities.
Scott Morrison became Australia's new prime minister, after Malcolm Turnbull was ousted by mps in his Liberal Party. It is the fifth change of prime minister in a decade. There might be a sixth if a by-election for Mr Turnbull's parliamentary seat in Sydney wipes out the government's one-seat majority.
A visit to North Korea by Mike Pompeo, America's secretary of state, was called off. Mr Pompeo was to meet negotiators in Pyongyang, but President Donald Trump said the talks on nuclear disarmament were not advancing, for which he blamed China. North Korea warned that if the talks collapse it will resume tests of missiles and nuclear devices.
The unwelcome mat
Italy allowed almosti40 rescued migrants off a coastguard ship after refusing them entry for nearly a week. But the interior minister warned that Italy will withhold eu budget payments unless a system for sharing out arrivals among other eu countries is found. He also said Italy may breach euro-zone deficit limits in its next budget, due to be published soon.
Far-right protesters battled with police in the German city of Chemnitz, in Saxony. They were demonstrating following the fatal stabbing of a German man, reportedly by Middle Eastern migrants. Some of the protesters beat migrants and gave illegal Nazi salutes.
Emmanuel Macron, the French president, suffered a blow when his environment minister resigned during a live broadcast, criticising his government for not doing enough to combat global warming.
AlexSalmond, a former first minister of Scotland and a leading figure in the movement for Scottish independence, resigned from the Scottish National Party amid claims of sexual misconduct. He said he hoped to rejoin once he had cleared his name.
In search of friends
Theresa May visited three African countries, in the first trip by a British prime minister to the continent for five years. Mrs May is trying to strengthen trade, security and diplomatic ties with the region and to avoid losing influence to powers such as France and China, which have also been stepping up their engagement.
Emmerson Mnangagwa was sworn in as president of Zimbabwe after the Constitutional Court rejected a call by the opposition to throw out the results of a flawed presidential election that had been held in July. The court ruled that the opposition had failed to prove its allegation that the vote was rigged.
A judicial commission started hearing evidence of corruption in South Africa during the presidency of Jacob Zuma. Testimony at the commission into ""state capture"" has revealed details of how friends of Mr Zuma allegedly offered positions in his cabinet, including that of minister of finance.
Iran's parliament voted to censure President Hassan Rouhani after grilling him on television over the country's economic problems. Two days earlier parliament sacked the finance minister. Iran is suffering from a collapsing currency and surging inflation, in part the result of America reimposing sanctions after pulling out of an agreement to limit Iran's nuclear programme earlier this year.
The un released a report accusing the governments of Yemen, the United Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia of committing war crimes- including rape and torture- during Yemen's four-year civil war. The report said the Houthi rebels, who are fighting the government and its backers, are to blame for many of the same crimes.
All for naught
A referendum to control corruption in Colombia failed to pass because turnout, at less than a third of the electorate, was too low. All seven measures received the support of over 99% of voters who participated in the referendum. They included a three-term limit for legislators and a requirement that elected officials publish their tax returns.
America said it would reevaluate its relationship with El Salvador after the Central American country broke diplomatic ties with Taiwan and established them with China. The White House said that El Salvador's decision would affect ""the economic health and security of the entire Americas region"". America also recognises China and does not have formal diplomatic relations with Taiwan. Chile's supreme court ordered the family of Augusto Pinochet, a dictator who ruled from 1973 to 1990, to return part of the money he had stashed in the Virgin Islands. The family must give up $i.6m of a fortune worth $i3m.
The new power generation
In Florida the party primaries for governor resulted in an interesting matchup for the election. The Republicans chose Ron DeSantis, whose campaign took off when he was endorsed by Mr Trump. The Democrats selected Andrew Gillum, an unabashed progressive who will become the state's first black governor if he wins in November.
A federal court ruled, once again, that North Carolina's congressional districts have been gerrymandered along partisan lines to favour Republicans. The Supreme Court had sent the case back to the lower courts for consideration.
Puerto Rico officially raised the death toll from last September's Hurricane Maria to 2,975. That is up from the previous tally of 64, a figure that had always been disputed. The new toll is based on an independent study.
Tributes were paid to John McCain, who died from brain cancer aged 81. Mr McCain had represented Arizona in the Senate since 1987. He was probably the most outspoken Republican critic of Mr Trump. The White House got into a flap when its flag was raised to full-staff less than two days after Mr McCain's death. It was lowered again to half-staff, where it will stay until his funeral, which Mr Trump will not attend.
Business
The United States and Mexico reached a deal on revising the North American Free Trade Agreement. Mexico made several concessions, notably on car manufacturing, which America had demanded in order to boost its own automotive industry. President Donald Trump suggested that Canada, the other partner in nafta, had little choice but to accept the revised accord and said that he might impose new tariffs on its car industry if it did not. Some Republicans chafed at that; a trilateral nafta would get a smoother ride in Congress than a bilateral deal with Mexico.
The s&p Бос and nasdaq stockmarket indices reached record highs, with the latter closing above the 8,000 mark for the first time. They were buoyed in part by a measure of American consumer confidence that registered its strongest reading since October 2000. New data showed that the American economy grew at a slightly faster annualised rate in the second quarter than had been thought: 4.2%.
PresidentMauricio Macri of Argentina unexpectedly asked the International Monetary Fund to speed up the disbursement of a loan worth $50bn. He wants to ensure the country can meet its debt obligations in spite of a growing economic crisis. The Argentine peso has lost more than 40% of its value against the American dollar this year and inflation is rising.
Making your mind up
Elon Musk reversed course and said that Tesla would remain a public company after all. The chief executive of the electriccarmaker stunned investors when he announced in a tweet that he intended to take Tesla private and had ""secured"" funding. He has since scrambled to explain his plans, amid reports that regulators were investigating whether he had followed the proper rules for disclosing them. Explaining his u-turn, Mr Musk said that going private would be more ""time-consuming"" than he had originally envisaged.
Toyota said it would invest $500m in Uber to work on developing autonomous cars. The Japanese carmaker has been more cautious than its global rivals in committing to self-driving technology. Its investment is a boost to Uber's self-driving project, which suffered a setback after a fatal collision involving a pedestrian and one of its cars in March.
China's biggest ride-hailing firm, Didi Chuxing, came under fire after a second murder of a female passenger by one of its drivers within four months. Didi suspended its carpooling service, for which the driver in question worked, but that did not stop the calls on Chinese social media for a boycott of the firm.
A meaty issue
Missouri became the first state in America to outlaw the description of food products as ""meat"" unless they are made from animal flesh. The law is being challenged by producers of lab-grown and plant-based meat alternatives, industries that have grand plans to take on conventional-meat firms.
Wonga, the biggest provider of payday loans in Britain, said it was considering ""all options"" amid reports it is close to collapse. The firm opened shop in 2007, charging interest rates that some said were excessive. But a regulatory crackdown that began in 2014 has crimped profits severely. Wonga has also taken a hit from compensating borrowers for its debt-collection practices.
Yum China, which was spun off from Yum Brands in 2016 and operates the kfc, Pizza Hut and Taco Bell fast-food chains in China, reportedly rejected a $i7bn buy-out offer from a consortium of private investment firms. Yum China is the country's biggest restaurant company.
The Turkish lira came under renewed pressure after Moody's downgraded 18 Turkish banks, which are heavily reliant on foreign-currency funding. The central bank did little to soothe jittery markets when it reintroduced a cap on overnight lending for banks, a source of liquidity.
After enduring its worst-ever spell of industrial action, Ryanair said that pilots in Italy, its second-biggest market, had accepted the terms of a new collective labour agreement. It has recently reached a deal with the union representing Irish pilots and has offered fresh negotiations to its British, German and Spanish pilots.
The Bond market
Aston Martin announced plans for an ipo on the London Stock Exchange. The British maker of sports cars has gone bankrupt several times, but business is now booming, particularly in Asia. Its association with the James Bond films partly explains Aston Martin's success in recent years; it is reproducing 25 versions of the DB5 used in ""Goldfinger"", complete with revolving number plates ""and more"". It is unlikely that fans will catch much sight of them: the new DB5s are not allowed to be driven on public roads.

A new prime minister tries to end divisions in his party
""THE age of bitterness has come to a close,"" Scott Morrison, Australia's prime minister, declared on August 27th, three days after a feud within the right-of-centre Liberal Party toppled his predecessor, Malcolm Turnbull. Mr Morrison, the former treasurer, became prime minister almost by default, after a hard-right faction within the party launched a failed bid for the leadership. He has assembled a ""new generation team"" (consisting mainly of ageing white males) and promises to ""begin the process of healing"".
Mr Morrison's cure involves offering several important cabinet positions to the losing band of restive conservatives. Peter Dutton, its leader, returns to his previous job as home-affairs minister, in which he will continue to champion the policy of detaining ""boat people"" in Pacific island processing centres (responsibility for legal immigration has been given to a different minister). Tony Abbott, a former party leader and prime minister who harried Mr Turnbull from the backbenches, was awarded a token role as an adviser on indigenous affairs.
Mr Morrison has also bowed to the conservatives on climate change. He has split responsibility for energy and the environment, giving the former to Angus Taylor, a climate-change sceptic who denounces renewable energy. Mr Taylor is charged only with lowering power prices. There has been no talk of reducing emissions-the subject that sparked the rebellion against Mr Turnbull.
Polls show that voters are unimpressed at the turmoil. Mr Morrison must devise a platform to win them back before an election due by May.

 SYDNEY 
 A new prime minister tries to end divisions in his party 
 "" THE age of bitterness has come to a close , "" Scott Morrison , Australia 's prime minister , declared on August 27th , three days after a feud within the right - of - centre Liberal Party toppled Malcolm Turnbull's . Mr Morrison , the former treasurer , became prime minister almost by default , after a hard - right faction within the party launched a failed bid for the leadership . He has assembled a "" new generation team "" ( consisting mainly of ageing white males ) and promises to "" begin the process of healing "" . 
 Mr Morrison 's cure involves offering several important cabinet positions to the losing band of restive conservatives . Peter Dutton , its leader , returns to his previous job as home - affairs minister , in which he will continue to champion the policy of detaining "" boat people "" in Pacific island processing centres ( responsibility for legal immigration has been given to a different minister ) . Tony Abbott , a former party leader and prime minister who harried Malcolm Turnbull from the backbenches , was awarded a token role as an adviser on indigenous affairs . 
 Mr Morrison has also bowed to the conservatives on climate change . He has split responsibility for energy and the environment , giving the former to Angus Taylor , a climate - change sceptic who denounces renewable energy . Mr Taylor is charged only with lowering power prices . There has been no talk of reducing emissions - the subject that sparked the rebellion against Malcolm Turnbull . 
 Polls show that voters are unimpressed at the turmoil . Mr Morrison must devise a platform to win them back before an election due by May. A clue to his plans comes from the creation of a ministry for "" congestion - busting "" and population growth . It was awarded to Alan Tudge , another supporter of Mr Dutton 's . He says his job will be to make high rates of immigration palatable by improving infrastructure .

President Donald Trump suggested, without evidence, that the Democrats had a hand in organising it and that ""criminals and unknown Middle Easterners"" are part of the group. America's mid-term elections are on November 6th.
Julian Assange, a co-founder of WikiLeaks, sued Ecuador, whose embassy in London has given him comfortable refuge since 2012. WikiLeaks accuses Ecuador of blocking his communications. The embassy has also told him to take better care of his cat. Mr Assange originally entered the building to avoid extradition to Sweden to face sexual-assault charges that have since been dropped. He still fears extradition to America for publishing its secrets.
Arms and the man
Donald Trump announced that America would withdraw from an arms-control treaty with Russia that banishes shortand mid-range nuclear missiles from Europe. The treaty was signed in 1987 by Mikhail Gorbachev and Ronald Reagan. America accuses Russia of developing a missile system that breaks its terms, which Moscow denies. Mr Trump and Vladimir Putin are to meet on November 11th; the topic is sure to come up.
Packages containing suspected pipe-bombs were sent to some leading Democrats, including the Clintons and the Obamas, and to George Soros, a billionaire philanthropist who backs progressive causes.
The Justice Department filed criminal charges against a woman for her alleged role in a Russian conspiracy to ""sow discord"" in American elections, including the midterms. The woman, based in St Petersburg, is said to be the accountant for a disinformation project backed by a pro-Putin Russian oligarch. It is claimed she disbursed money for activists, advertisements on social media and ""promoting news postings on social networks.""
The skin of its teeth
Australia's Liberal Party lost a by-election for a seat in Sydney that had been held by Malcolm Turnbull, who was ousted as prime minister by his party in August. That means the governing coalition has lost its one-seat majority in Parliament and will have to depend on independent mps to survive any vote of no confidence.
Afghanistan held its first parliamentary election in eight years. Less than a third of potential voters registered and only half of those turned out, largely for fear of being killed by jihadists. At least 50 people were murdered by the Taliban, which had warned people not to vote.
Thousands of people marched through Taipei, the capital of Taiwan, calling for a referendum on whether to declare official independence from China. Such a move would infuriate the Chinese government in Beijing.
Pakistan secured a $6bn loan from Saudi Arabia to bolster its depleted foreign reserves. The country has also turned to the imf for help.
Nguyen Phu Trong, the head of Vietnam's Communist Party, consolidated his grip on power, as he was sworn in as the country's new president. Trong received 99.8% of the vote in the rubber-stamp parliament (he was the only name on the ballot) and is the first person to hold both jobs since Ho Chi Minh in the 1960s.
China's president, Xi Jinping, opened the world's longest sea bridge. Costing $20bn, the 55km (34-mile) Hong KongZhuhai-Macau Bridge spans the Pearl river estuary and is part of a government plan to integrate the region's cities into one giant economic and transport hub.
Who gave the order?
Muhammad bin Salman, the crown prince and effective ruler of Saudi Arabia, distanced himself from the killers of Jamal Khashoggi, after the kingdom at last admitted that he had been murdered in the Saudi consulate in Istanbul. The killing has harmed Saudi relations with Turkey and prompted Germany to halt arms sales to the country.
King Abdullah of Jordan said he will not renew Israel's 25-year lease over two areas bordering the two countries. The leases had been granted as part of Jordan's peace treaty with Israel in 1994.
A Japanese journalist abducted three years ago in Syria was freed by his captors. Jumpei Yasuda is thought to have been held by the Nusra Front, a group linked to al-Qaeda that has kidnapped foreigners for ransom in the past.
At least 55 people were killed in fighting between farmers and herders in Nigeria, underscoring the poor state of security in many parts of the country ahead of a presidential election scheduled for February.
Rebels in the Democratic Republic of Congo killed at least 15 people in an area affected by an outbreak of Ebola. The attack threatens to disrupt efforts to contain the virus.
Paul Biya, who has ruled Cameroon since 1982, was declared the winner of a presidential election marred by violence and a low turnout in the country's two Englishspeaking regions.
Heading for a showdown
The European Commission in Brussels rejected Italy's budget. It calls for a 2.4% deficit this year, which, given the size of Italy's debt, is not considered sustainable. The Italian government has been given three weeks to revise it, or face sanctions. In Rome, Matteo Salvini, one of the leaders of the populist coalition government, said he would not alter the budget.
Germany warned its citizens visiting Turkey to be cautious about their social-media feeds, following several cases of Germans being arrested for criticising the Turkish president, Recep Tayyip Erdogan. In the biggest demonstration in Britain since the start of the Iraq war, an estimated 700,000 people took to the streets of London to call for a ""People's Vote"" on the final Brexit deal. Britain has been divided for two years over the outcome of the referendum to leave the eu. A much less publicised march took place in Harrogate to ""save Brexit"" and attracted a much smaller crowd.
Stockmarkets had another rocky week. The nasdaq index recorded its biggest one-day decline in more than seven years and the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell below the level at which it started the year. A co-ordinated confidence-boosting effort by senior government officials in China pledging support for markets helped its stockmarkets chalk up their biggest single-day gains in almost three years. But the positive sentiment soon evaporated.
The tiger's tail
China's economy grew by 6.5% in the third quarter, year on year. That was the slowest pace since early 2009, in the depth of the financial crisis. The figure does not yet fully reflect the trade war with America, because the largest portion of tariffs imposed on Chinese exports came into effect only in late September. More penalties are due to be implemented in January.
Deutsche Bank released disappointing quarterly earnings. The German bank recorded sharp declines in sales and trading revenue compared with the same three months last year, a contrast to the increased income reported by American investment banks. Net profit fell by 65%, to €229m ($266m). Christian Sewing, who took over as chief executive in April, insisted that the bank would make its first annual profit since 2014.
The state of New York filed a lawsuit against ExxonMobil, claiming that it misled investors about the risk that regulations on climate change posed to its business. The suit alleges that the oil company ""built a façade to deceive"" how it measured the risk and frequently did not apply the ""proxy cost"" of carbon, which accounts for expected future events, to its decisions.
A judge in California slashed the amount in total damages- from $289m to $78m-awarded by a jury to a school groundsman who claims his cancer was caused by Roundup, a weedkiller made by Monsanto. But the judge refused to order a retrial, a blow to Bayer, the German chemical conglomerate that took over Monsanto this year. Bayer's share price swooned after the ruling. It is to appeal against the decision.
PR offensive
Facebook appointed Sir Nick Clegg as its new head of global affairs. The former British deputy prime minister said he wanted ""to build bridges between politics and tech"", which will involve a lot of shuffling between Silicon Valley, Washington and Brussels. Some hope he has better luck in the job than as leader of the Liberal Democrats, who saw their support collapse after he reneged on a promise not to increase university tuition fees.
Hoping it can overcome a costly industrial dispute that has helped wipe 40% off its market value this year, Air France-KLM signed a pay deal with three-quarters of its staff, which meets a threshold for the agreement to become binding and implemented. Although the main pilots' union withheld its support, the deal is a significant success for Ben Smith, the airline's new Canadian chief executive.
Also hit by a wave of strikes this year, Ryanair said its pre-tax profit fell by 9% in the six months to September 30th, to €ı.3bn ($i.5bn). Europe's biggest low-cost airline has had to contend with the rising price of oil. Despite heavy hedging, its fuel costs were up by a fifth.
Tesla reported a surprise, and rare, quarterly profit, of $3i2m. The electric-car maker also pleased its dogged investors by improving its cashflow, which bolsters its argument that it doesn't need to turn to the markets to raise funds. Its Model 3 was the best-selling car in America by revenue and the fifth by volume. With its usual gift for understatement, Tesla described the quarter as ""truly historic"".
For the defence
AT&t lost a further 346,000 video subscribers in the latest quarter. The migration of satellite-TV customers to online-streaming broadcasters, such as Netflix, was the rationale behind AT&T's takeover of Time Warner (since rebranded as WarnerMedia). That business reported a rise in sales in the quarter to $8.2bn, boosted by blockbuster films such as ""Crazy Rich Asians"".
In its first big deal since Mike Manley took over as chief executive after the death of Sergio Marchionne, Fiat Chrysler Automobiles said it was selling Magneti Marelli, its components subsidiary, to Calsonic Kansei for €6.2bn ($7.ibn). Calsonic is owned by KKR, a private-equity firm.
Dyson, a British manufacturer best known for its cordless vacuum-cleaners, selected Singapore as the site for a new factory in its expansion into electric vehicles. The company stressed that its choice had nothing to do with Brexit. Sir James Dyson, the company's founder and a strong supporter of Brexit, once described the idea that no one would trade with Britain once it left the eu as ""absolute cobblers"".","Some 7,000 Central American migrants travelling together towards America entered Mexico from Guatemala, despite an attempt by Mexican police to stop them.

The last time Australia suffered a recession, the Soviet Union still existed and the internet did not. An American-led force had just liberated Kuwait, and almost half the world's current population had not yet been born. Unlike most of its region, Australia was left unscathed by the Asian crash of 1997. Unlike most of the developed world, it shrugged off the global financial crisis, and unlike most commodity-exporting countries, it weathered the resources bust, too. No other rich country has ever managed to grow so steadily for so long (see chart 1 on next page). By that measure, at least, Australia boasts the world's most successful economy.
Admittedly, as Guy Debelle of the Reserve Bank of Australia (rba, the central bank) points out, this title rests on the statistical definition of a recession as two consecutive quarters of decline. Had the 0.5% shrinkage of the fourth quarter of 2008 been spread across half a year, he notes, there would be no record. Yet by other measures, Australia's economic performance is more remarkable still. Whereas many other rich countries have seen wages stagnate for decades, Australia's have grown strongly, albeit less steadily in recent years (see chart 2). In other words, a problem that has agitated policymakers-and voters-around the world, and has been blamed for all manner of political upheaval, from European populism to the election of Donald Trump, scarcely exists in Australia.
And that is not the only way in which Australia stands out from its peers. At a time when governments around the world are souring on immigration, and even seeking to send some foreigners home, Australia has been admitting as many as 190,000 newcomers a year-nearly three times as many, relative to population, as America. Over 28% of the population was born in another country, far more than in other rich countries. Half of all living Australians were born abroad or are the child of someone who was.
In part, this tolerance for outsiders may be a reflection of another remarkable feature of Australian society: the solvency of its welfare state. Complaints about foreign spongers are rare. Public debt amounts to just 41% of gdp (see chart 3)-one of the lowest levels in the rich world. That, in turn, is a function not just of Australia's enviable record in terms of growth, but also of a history of shrewd policymaking. Nearly 30 years ago, the government of the day overhauled the pension system. Since then workers have been obliged to save for their retirement through private investment funds. The modest public pension covers only those without adequate savings.
Australia's health-care system is also a public-private hybrid. The government provides coverage for all, by paying clinics and hospitals a set fee for every procedure they perform. Those who want more than the most basic service must pay a premium. The government encourages people to take out insurance to cover the gap between the reimbursement it provides practitioners and the rates most of them charge the public. As with pensions, everyone gets looked after, but the government bears only a relatively small proportion of the cost-an arrangement that remains a distant dream in most rich countries.
Not all is perfect, of course. A common concern is that the economy relies too heavily on China, which is the biggest buyer of Australian minerals, the biggest source of tourists and foreign students, even the biggest consumer of Australian wine. People worry that if the Chinese economy falters, it will drag Australia's down with it. Another fear, somewhat at odds with the first, is that China might try to use its economic power to blackmail Australia into weakening its alliance with America.
There are glaring domestic problems, too. The appalling circumstances of many Aboriginals are a national embarrassment, and the failure to answer their political grievances compounds the rancour. Even more alarmingly, global warming is making an already gruelling climate harsher. Rainfall, never reliable, is scarcer and more erratic in many farming regions. Over the past two years unusually hot water has killed a third of the coral on the Great Barrier Reef, one of the country's greatest natural treasures.
In theory both the governing LiberalNational coalition (which is right-of-centre) and the main opposition, the left-leaning Labor Party, are committed to cutting emissions of greenhouse gases. But in practice climate change has been the subject of a never-ending political knife-fight, in which any government that attempts to enact meaningful curbs is so pilloried that it either loses the next election or is toppled by a rebellion among its own mps.
Some see the failure to settle on a coherent climate policy as a symptom of a deeper political malaise. Australia used to have long-lived governments. Between 1983 and 2007, just three prime ministers held office (Bob Hawke and Paul Keating of Labor, and John Howard of the Liberals). Yet, since then, the job has changed hands six times. A full term is only three years, but the last time a prime minister survived in office for a whole one was 2004-07. The assassins are usually not voters, but fellow mps who dispatch their leader in hope of a boost in the polls. As part of the research for this special report, your correspondent interviewed Malcolm Turnbull, the prime minister at the time, who insisted his position was secure. He had been sacked by his fellow Liberals before the interview could be written up.
The changes of pm have come so often that Madame Tussauds, a wax museum, has officially given up trying to make statues of the incumbent, who will inevitably have left office before a likeness is ready. The constant revolution is not just fodder for comedians; it also makes consistent policymaking much harder. For those who consider Australia's unequalled economic performance the result, at least in part, of far-sighted decisions made 30 years ago, the current choppy politics seem like a harbinger of decline.
This special report will try to explain Australia's enviable record, and ask how long its good fortune can last. Is it adopting the reforms needed to keep the economy bounding ahead? Will it have to choose between China and America? Is the current generation of politicians up to the job? Is Australia, in short, as lucky a country as its nickname suggests, or is its current streak coming to an end?","Australia 's economy is without equal in the rich world .

Harsher weather threatens more than just the environment
Climate change is not threatening Dale Park's livelihood, but it is not making his life easier, either. His small cattle farm near Badgingarra in Western Australia gets about 580mm of rain a year-well below the 650mm that was typical when he first moved there 30 years ago. The rain is also coming at different times, with summer storms more common than they used to be. And the number of really hot days is increasing, especially in spring. Mr Park has been able to adapt, mainly by planting different types of fodder. But for wheat farmers, he explains, as his dogs merrily give chase to a passing flock of emus, it is not so easy.
Only a small corner of the state-the south-western extreme, near the capital, Perth-has ever been arable. To the north or east the crops soon give way to arid bush and then desert. In some places the transition is so abrupt, Mr Park says, that annual rainfall drops by an inch for every mile east you go.
Now the winds from the Indian Ocean that brought what little rain there was are shifting southwards, causing the arable zone to become drier. Fancy equipment and new planting techniques help farmers make do with less rain. Crops do not fail, but simply grow less well. Some struggling farmers cope by switching crops or rearing sheep instead of planting. All the same, Mr Park concludes, ""We're starting to run out of resilience.""
It is not just farmers who are affected. Because less rain is falling and more water is evaporating due to higher temperatures, the flow into the reservoirs that supply Perth has plunged by 80% since the 1970s. This, along with rapid growth in the city's population, has meant that it has had to build two desalination plants, as well as a facility to recycle sewage water, at a total cost of well over A$i.5bn. It has also imposed strict rules on water use. Homeowners, for example, are allowed to use sprinklers only twice a week.
On the opposite side of the country, in Queensland, the effects of climate change are even more obvious. Parts of Eddy Reef, one of the hundreds of separate coral formations that make up the 2,300km-long Great Barrier Reef, are stunning. Gem-like fish dart in and out of twisting brown branches of stag coral. A giant clam opens iridescent blue lips. Feathery fan corals sway in the current.
But a few metres away, the scene is much less colourful. The stag coral here is a drab greyish white. Wisps of algae are starting to coat its surface. There are fewer fish. This is the result of a process called bleaching, in which coral reacts to higher water temperatures by ejecting the microscopic algae that give it colour. If the temperature does not quickly fall again, the coral dies. This is what has happened to about a third of the Great Barrier Reef over the past two years.
Bleaching, cyclones and infestations of crown-ofthorns starfish, which munch through coral, all damage parts of the reef from time to time. The amount of coral fluctuates depending on how often and how severely such adversity strikes. In the northern portion of the reef, in particular, coral cover is at the lowest level ever recorded. David Wachenfeld of the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority, the government agency responsible for its protection, says that the higher water temperatures brought on by global warming have led to more frequent bouts of bleaching, leaving the reef too little time to recover in between. Like the farmers of Western Australia, it is running out of resilience.
It is not just ecologists who are anxious. A study published last year by Deloitte, an accountancy firm, found that the reef generated A$6.4bn in economic activity in 2016 and supported 64,000 jobs. Already, tourism operators say they are suffering because of all the negative publicity surrounding the bleaching.
Climate change is causing other problems, too. The incidence of droughts, such as the one currently afflicting eastern Australia, is increasing. Parched landscapes, in turn, lead to more frequent and destructive bushfires. And then there are more mundane burdens, such as the extra outlay on air-conditioning in response to rising temperatures.
Yet Australia still gets more than 60% of its power from coal, the fuel that does the most damage to the climate. It is also the world's biggest exporter of coal. Per person, it generates more emissions than any other big economy bar America and Saudi Arabia. And unlike most rich countries, its emissions are growing.
Australia was the first country in the world to set up a government agency devoted to cutting emissions, under Mr Howard in 1998. But since then politicians have feuded endlessly about how to bring about any cuts. Mr Howard refused to commit Australia to stringent reductions by ratifying the Kyoto protocol. Labor took him to task about climate change in the election campaign in which he was finally ousted, in 2007. His successor, Kevin Rudd, ratified Kyoto right away, but then dithered about introducing an emissions-trading scheme, as he had promised. That helped spur the coup in which Mr Rudd was deposed by his deputy, Julia Gillard, who instituted a carbon tax in 2011, only to be pilloried by the right for levying ""a great big tax on everything"".
This attack helped the Liberals to win the subsequent election, in 2013; they promptly repealed the tax. But they have struggled to come up with an alternative. It was Mr Turnbull's effort to enshrine very small emissions-reduction targets in law that prompted the coup against him earlier this year within the Liberal Party.
Perhaps unsurprisingly, the new prime minister, Mr Morrison, has kept quiet on the subject. But even politically, let alone environmentally, that is not an option. Three-quarters of Australians are worried about climate change, according to a recent poll. A majority think the government is not doing enough. They are keen on renewable energy and on phasing out coal-fired generation. They do not want the government to wait for other big polluters such as America and China to act before trying to cut emissions.""People want a coherent idea about the future,"" says Tim Winton, a novelist and activist, not ""shouting into a bucket"".

Poisonous politics could spell an end to Australia's winning streak
That australia has not managed to institute a sensible, durable policy on a subject like climate change strikes many as a sign that there is something wrong with politics. ""This lot couldn't manage a jar of five-cent bits,"" fumes Mr Keating. It is a common complaint, and not just from the opposition.
It is clearly the case that governments do not last as long as they did (see timeline). Many also believe that they achieve less. The Grattan Institute, a think-tank, counts 15 big economic reforms in the 12 years that Messrs Hawke and Keating were in government, eight during Mr Howard's 11-year stint and six in the decade since.
There is also a view that politicians used to be more able to rise above partisan politics and defy their supporters. Nowadays, the argument runs, politicians of either stripe are too busy poring over the polling data or looking over their shoulders to do anything remotely risky. If so, they would be right to: Rod Tiffen of the University of Sydney points out that, at both the state and federal level, ""spill motions"", meaning internal challenges for the leadership of a party, have become much more common. And one of the most common excuses for mounting such coups is that the incumbent trails in the polls.
In some ways, Australian politics appears more stable than that of other rich countries. Insurgent parties are not displacing the established ones, as in Europe, nor are populist candidates taking control of political machines, as Donald Trump has in America. But Australia is not free from discontent; it is just insulated from it by its electoral system.
No matter how disaffected Australians are with their choices, they must vote, and are fined if they do not. This helps to keep politics grounded squarely in the centre. It also favours the big parties, since those who might not be interested in politics seem unlikely to plump for an obscure option.
Moreover, when they vote, Australians do not just pick one candidate for each office. They rank them in order of preference. When the ballots are counted, the one with the least first-choice votes is eliminated. His or her votes are then redistributed to whichever candidate was listed as the second choice, and so on, until one has more than half of the vote. This also favours the two main political forces (Labor and the Liberal-National coalition) since even those who select a small party as their first choice tend to list a big one below. Only five out of the 150 members of the lower house (the House of Representatives) are from neither the coalition nor Labor.
But just because the system is stable does not mean that it is loved. Public esteem for politicians has declined markedly. In 1969, 51% of people polled by the Australian Election Study, a longrunning survey, agreed that ""people in government can be trusted""; in 2016, only 26% did. Whereas in the 1980s more than 90% of voters selected one of the two big parties as their first choice for the House of Representatives, at the most recent election, in 2016, only 77% did. Voters report ever less interest in elections and their outcome, and ever less confidence that their vote will make any difference. More and more think that politicians are in it for themselves and that special interests have too much sway. Only 60% say they are satisfied with democracy.
A few kangaroos loose in the top paddock
The constant churn of prime ministers is fodder for these feelings of disillusionment. Four of the past five changes have come from spill motions, not from elections. Parties keep presenting one person to voters as their prime-ministerial candidate, only to boot him or her out after a year or two. It is natural for voters to feel deceived. And no party that has turned on its own pm in the past decade has done better at the next election than at the previous one.
Mr Tiffen argues that spills will only fall out of fashion when it is clear that voters will punish a party for resorting to them. Proof may be coming soon. After the latest one, in which the Liberals ejected Mr Turnbull in favour of Mr Morrison, the party did not even see a brief bump in the polls. One government mp called the petition for a spill a ""suicide note""; another was so enraged that he moved to the crossbenches, depriving the government of its majority in the House of Representatives.
The infighting, in other words, is clearly impeding the business of government. And even if Mr Morrison wanted to pursue bold reforms, he does not have time before the next election, which is due by May. Figuring out where Australia should get its energy from or how warmly to embrace China will have to wait yet another six months, at least.
It is easy to imagine a cycle in which the constant changes of leadership make policymaking even less consistent, further sapping faith in government and making politicians even more timid. That is especially alarming because the trend of rising incomes which marks Australia out from the rest of the rich world is running out of steam, and the consensus around policies that underpinned it, such as openness to immigration, is eroding. If politicians do not sort themselves out, Australia risks becoming as troubled as everywhere else. ?

A lurch to the right leaves the ruling party in the lurch
DANIEL ANDREWS, the premier of the Australian state of Victoria, calls his government ""the most progressive...in the nation"". In a state election on November 24th it was returned to power in a landslide. Results are still trickling in, but as The Economist went to press, the Labor party had won almost 43% of first-choice votes (the electoral system allows voters to rank parties in order of preference), compared with 31% for the Liberals, the country's conservative ruling party. Victorians, Mr Andrews declared, had chosen a ""positive and optimistic plan"" over ""the low road of fear and division"".
In his four years in charge, Mr Andrews has dug metro stations, built schools and legalised voluntary euthanasia. The state's economy is Australia's fastest-growing. Whereas his party campaigned on its ability to ""get things done"", the Liberals tried to convince Victorians that their capital city, Melbourne, was under siege. Crime is running ""out of control"", insisted the party's leader in the state, Matthew Guy. Victoria, it pronounced, is the ""state of disorder"".
First the Liberals accused South Sudanese immigrants of terrorising the state. Their marauding gangs make Victorians ""scared to go out to restaurants"", complained the reactionary federal immigration minister, Peter Dutton, after a spate of crimes last year. ""African chaos"" shrieked the state's most-read newspaper, following a fracas in August. A religiously motivated attack two weeks before the election was swiftly politicised, too. The perpetrator was an Islamist of Somali birth, who fatally stabbed a café-owner in Melbourne before being shot by police. Conservatives in Victoria's parliament immediately blamed the state government for not having locked him up, and suggested suspicious characters should be banned from city centres.
But this tub-thumping does not seem to have resonated. Almost a third of Victorians were born abroad. It did not help the Liberals' case that crime has fallen by almost 8% over the past year, and that Africans account for only a tiny sliver of it. The Liberals' share of first-choice votes was down by six percentage points compared with the previous election. In the wealthy suburban constituency of Brighton, which Labor has never won, its 19-year-old candidate, a student, lost by only a whisker.
That should serve as a warning to the federal Liberal party, which is locked in an ideological identity battle ahead of an election due by May. The right wing, led by Mr Dutton, attempted to drag the party in its direction in August by deposing the moderate prime minister, Malcolm Turnbull. Some claimed this would help win marginal votes in the conservative state of Queensland. In the past the party has had great electoral success stoking fears about unchecked immigration. Yet its obvious fear-mongering and its refusal even to discuss climate change-coal is another of the right wing's pet causes-have alienated centrists, leading to trouncings at recent by-elections in Sydney and rural New South Wales. Moderates are at a loss. A disgruntled federal MP resigned from the party after the election in Victoria, further reducing the standing of the Liberal-led minority government. She complained that the party was in the hands of rightwing reactionaries, and that most of her colleagues were too self-interested to stand up to them. The polls suggest that even bigger embarrassments loom.","Australian politics

A FEW DAYS ago a respected member of the Liberal Party, which governs (if that is quite the word for it) in coalition with the smaller National Party, dropped a bombshell in Parliament: she was quitting the party to sit on the crossbenches as an independent. Julia Banks, the only Liberal to snatch a seat from the opposition Labor Party in the most recent general election in 2016, said she was sick of the direction her party was taking. ""The Liberal Party has changed,"" she said, because of a ""reactionary right wing who talk about, and talk to, themselves rather than listening to the people"". As if in support, the women's minister, Kelly O'Dwyer, said in a leaked discussion with colleagues that the party's leaders were seen as ""homophobic, anti-women, climate-change deniers"".
The Liberal Party has a problem. Not least, Ms Banks's move to the crossbenches, which follows an earlier defection, leaves the government two votes short of a majority. What is more, many voters agree with Ms O'Dwyer. They also think the party ignores people's worries about affording a home and having sufficient savings to retire. And though successive governments have come to grief trying to craft a policy on climate change, this government strides purposefully away from a solution-despite the strong popular desire for one.

In August they defenestrated the man, Malcolm Turnbull, who had called and won the previous election, and had attempted to govern as a probusiness and socially liberal centrist. One of the cabal, Peter Dutton, a vituperative populist, failed to secure Mr Turnbull's crown. In the ensuing scrimmage, which did few of its participants credit, Mr Morrison won it almost by accident. The most competent moderate, Julie Bishop, was swiftly trampled.
Over the years, party leadership ""spills"" have become ever more frequent-of the five prime ministers of the past decade, four came to power in one. They are usually launched when leaders are blamed for their party's poor showing in the polls.
They do little good. Parties almost always perform worse in an election after a spill than they did at the preceding one. In a tacit admission of this, the Liberal party changed its rules this week to make spills harder. Too late: before the one in August, the Liberals were trailing Labor by two or three percentage points; today the gap has widened to ten. It is as if voters are even keener to punish the party, for presenting one candidate for prime minister only to kick him out. Astonishingly, in October the party managed to lose the super-safe seat Mr Turnbull had vacated. Earlier this month in a state election in Victoria, it saw a dramatic drop in support, paving the way for Labor's re-election. John Howard, (Liberal) prime minister from 1996 to 2007, dismissed the setback by explaining that Victoria was the ""Massachusetts of Australia"", glossing over the fact that it is home to a quarter of Australians. The party is staring defeat in the face in an election in March in New South Wales, long a Liberal stronghold.
The party faces a thrashing in a general election due by May. Yet, says John Hewson, another former Liberal leader, all Mr Morrison, a former marketing supremo, has to offer is ""a pocketful of slogans"". Several of the party's spillers may well lose their seats, including Mr Dutton and Tony Abbott, the arch-conservative ringleader who was briefly prime minister before Mr Turnbull spilled him in 2015. (Mr Abbott had spilled Mr Turnbull in 2009.)
When local party members looked set to deselect Craig Kelly, a cheerleader for coal and backer of Mr Dutton, he threatened to quit the party unless Mr Morrison overrode party rules. The threat worked, yet he was not called a traitor.
In politics, says one senior party member, you used to make progress through compromise. ""Now, it's, 'If you don't give me something I want, I'll blow the place up.'"" Perhaps Mr Abbott and his like really do have a death wish. Perhaps they fancy that defeat by the Labor Party will have a wonderfully purgative effect, clearing the wets out of the Liberal Party and allowing their faction to enjoy unadulterated rule. What is nearly certain is that a grand old party faces a whipping next year. The question is whether it can survive at all.","Australia 's ruling party faces annihilation . Some members appear to want that 
 A FEW DAYS ago a respected member of the Liberal Party , which governs ( if that is quite the word for it ) in coalition with the smaller National Party , dropped a bombshell in Parliament : she was quitting the party to sit on the crossbenches as an independent . Julia Banks , the only Liberal to snatch a seat from the opposition Labor Party in the most recent general election in 2016 , said she was sick of the direction her party was taking . "" The Liberal Party has changed , "" she said , because of a "" reactionary right wing who talk about , and talk to , themselves rather than listening to the people "" . As if in support , the women 's minister , Kelly O'Dwyer , said in a leaked discussion with colleagues that the party 's leaders were seen as "" homophobic , anti - women , climate - change deniers "" . 
 The Liberal Party has a problem . Not least , Ms Banks 's move to the crossbenches , which follows an earlier defection , leaves the government two votes short of a majority . What is more , many voters agree with Ms O'Dwyer . They also think the party ignores people 's worries about affording a home and having sufficient savings to retire . And though successive governments have come to grief trying to craft a policy on climate change , this government strides purposefully away from a solution - despite the strong popular desire for one .

America imposed tariffs on $250bn-worth of Chinese products; China responded with tariffs of its own. America also slapped duties on steel imports from Europe, Canada, Mexico and elsewhere, infuriating its allies. Donald Trump intervened on national-security grounds to scupper a $щЬп bid from Broadcom, a chipmaker with ties to South-East Asia, for Qualcomm. It would have been the biggest-ever tech merger. There was one de-escalation: America, Canada and Mexico struck a deal to update nafta.
""Fire and Fury""
In another dysfunctional year at the White House, Rex Tillerson was sacked as secretary of state, as was Jeff Sessions as attorney-general, both after the president had publicly undermined them. The investigation by Robert Mueller, the special counsel, into Russian influence in American elections rumbled on, laying charges against some of Mr Trump's former aides. A voter backlash against Mr Trump propelled the Democrats to win the House of Representatives in the mid-terms, though the Republicans increased their majority in the Senate.
The messy spectacle of Brett Kavanaugh's confirmation hearings to the Supreme Court polarised American politics even further. With the #MeToo movement fully behind them, Democrats wheeled out sexualassault allegations from the early 1980s to try to block his path. Mr Kavanaugh survived the media circus and was eventually confirmed in the Senate by 50-48, the narrowest such margin since 1881. He appointed a team of all-female clerks, a first for the court.
Bother Brexit
After a year of tortuous Brexit negotiations, Theresa May and the European Commission agreed a deal for Britain's withdrawal from the European Union, but Britain's Parliament has not approved the agreement. Britain's prime minister clung to power after hard Brexiteers in her party tried to bring her down. Two-and-ahalf years after the referendum, the opposition Labour Party still had no coherent Brexit policy. Britain is due to leave the EU on March 29th.
Tensions increased between Britain and Russia after two Russian intelligence officers poisoned Sergei Skripal, a dissident, and his daughter with a nerve agent in Salisbury, an otherwise quiet cathedral town. They both survived. Russia paraded the attackers on television, claiming they were innocent tourists with an interest in church spires.
Facebook had a terrible year. The social network came under intense pressure to rein in fake news and protect user data. The revelation that Cambridge Analytica, a political consultancy that had worked on Donald Trump's campaign in 2016, had obtained information on 87m Facebook users through a third-party app shook the company to its core.
A large number of prominent chief executives left their jobs or announced their departures. The list includes Vittorio Colao at Vodafone, Indra Nooyi at PepsiCo, Paul Polman at Unilever, Martin Sorrell at wpp and Dieter Zetsche at Daimler. John Flannery was ousted at General Electric, as was John Cryan at Deutsche Bank. Carlos Ghosn was dismissed from Nissan for alleged misdeeds. The carmaking industry lost another giant with the death of Sergio Marchionne, Fiat Chrysler's boss.
Elon Musk stood down as Tesla's chairman, but remains chief executive, after tweeting that he intended to take the company private, a move that fell foul of regulators. The electric-car maker at last hit its production targets, and actually made a quarterly profit.
The world watched and waited as 12 boys and their football coach trapped in a flooded cave in Thailand were rescued in a complex operation involving thousands of people. A navy diver died in the attempt. Mr Musk tweeted unfounded claims that one of the rescuers was a paedophile. The rescuer had provoked Mr Musk by deriding his offer of a kid-sized submarine to help the boys escape as a pr stunt.
Carmakers ramped up their development of electric and self-driving vehicles. A woman was run down in Arizona by one of Uber's autonomous cars, the world's first fatal accident involving a pedestrian and a driverless vehicle.
In Syria the regime of Bashar al-Assad used chemical weapons again, killing scores of people in Douma, the last rebel stronghold in Eastern Ghouta. America responded by firing missiles at military targets. Later in the year a Russian military jet was shot down by Syria. Instead of blaming its ally, Russia said Israel was responsible because it had provided misleading information about a missile attack it had launched.
Xi Jinping confirmed his grip on power in China by promoting more of his allies to senior positions. Wang Qishan, who led a crackdown on corruption, was made vice-president. His new role includes helping to manage ties with America. The priority for the government was limiting the damage from the trade conflict with America; GDP in the third quarter grew at the slowest pace since the financial crisis. China's stockmarkets will finish the year well down.
Donald Trump hailed his summit with Kim Jong Un, North Korea's dictator, as a breakthrough, even going so far as to say ""we fell in love"" during the ongoing detente. But there has been little progress implementing the deal they signed. The North has been sending out mixed signals about whether it intends to denuclearise. The North's pr offensive included sending a team to the Winter Olympics that marched with the South Korean side under a reunification flag.
Mr Trump's attempt to replicate his tough-guy approach with Iran did not produce a similar rapprochement. He pulled out of the deal to roll back Iran's nuclear-weapons programme, describing it as ""rotten"". The reimposition of American sanctions, especially on its oil and gas industry, crippled Iran's economy.
Popular populists
Brazil and Mexico both elected populist leaders. Jair Bolsonaro, a fan of former military regimes, won Brazil's presidency after being stabbed during the campaign and losing 40% of his blood. Mexico elected Andrés Manuel López Obrador, a leftist with a penchant for dodgy referendums. AMLO, as he is called, slashed wages for top officials, including himself, and vowed to halt reforms of education and the oil sector.
In the year's other big elections, Colombia took a conservative turn when it elected Iván Duque as president. With the main opposition candidate barred from running, Vladimir Putin was easily re-elected as Russia's president. Pakistan got a new prime minister in Imran Khan, though the former cricket star had unsporting help from the army. Italy got a new populist coalition, which did little to tackle the country's mounting debt problem.
Malaysians ousted the increasingly corrupt party that had ruled their country since independence in 1957, even though it had tried to rig the ballot. And Zimbabwe's election was won by zanu-pf, sans Robert Mugabe. The opposition claimed the vote had been rigged, but the electoral commission insisted there had been no skulduggery.
Cyril Ramaphosa took over as South Africa's president when Jacob Zuma at last resigned after years of corruption scandals. The moribund economy emerged from recession. Australia also got a new leader when Malcolm Turnbull was ousted as prime minister by his party colleagues and replaced with Scott Morrison. The office has changed hands six times since 2007. Amid an impeachment vote, Pedro Pablo Kuczynski resigned as Peru's president.
The crisis of socialist mismanagement in Venezuela deepened, speeding up a mass exodus of its hungry and disenfranchised people. The military officers in charge of toilet-paper distribution failed to deliver. Inflation hit 1,000,000%. Nicolás Maduro, the president, gained another term in a sham election. He blamed Colombia for what he said was an assassination attempt on himself by drones. The event, captured on tv, showed troops fleeing rather than defending their leader.
I don't believe it
Global warming was said to be partly responsible for wildfires that killed some 100 people near Athens and at least 85 in California. A report by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change warned that such calamities will become more common if the world warms even by another 0.5°C. A White House report forecast grim effects for the American economy: Donald Trump said he didn't believe it. An international deal was struck on how to implement the Paris agreement on climate change.
Indonesia suffered two devastating earthquakes. The first struck the island of Lombok, killing over 560 people. The second triggered a tsunami in Sulawesi, killing more than 2,250 people.
Women got wheels
Saudi Arabia lifted a ban on female drivers. It also allowed cinemas to open for the first time in decades (the first film to be shown publicly was ""Black Panther""). But these small liberalising steps were overshadowed by the arbitrary locking up of feminists, plutocrats and many others.
The kingdom froze its links with Canada after Canada's foreign minister mildly criticised such abuses. Jamal Khashoggi, a journalist, was murdered and dismembered by Saudi operatives in a consulate in Istanbul.
The war in Yemen ground on. An air strike on a school bus that killed scores of children was just one incident in which civilians were caught up. The UN warned that the country was on the brink of a famine, with up to 14m people at risk of starvation.
Gun violence in America hit the headlines again. A former pupil went on a rampage at his high school in Florida on St Valentine's Day, murdering 17 people. Eleven Jews were murdered by a gunman at a synagogue in Pittsburgh, America's worst-ever anti-Semitic attack. Over one weekend in Chicago 75 people were shot in separate incidents, 13 of them fatally.
Trump grump
Jerome Powell continued gradually raising interest rates in his first year as chairman of the Federal Reserve. Mr Trump said he wasn't ""even a little bit happy"" with him. The political pressure Mr Powell endured was nothing compared with Turkey's central bank. Recep Tayyip Erdogan, Turkey's president, described high interest rates as ""the mother of all evil"" and claimed that they cause inflation. Most economists think they curb it. After a run on the lira, the central bank eventually raised rates regardless.
After a run on the peso, Argentina had to call in the IMF (again). Mauricio Macri, the president, introduced an austerity plan and new taxes on exports.
Stockmarkets appeared to be heading for their worst year since the financial crisis. Many leading indices, including the s&p 5oo, the Dow Jones Industrial Average and the ftse ioo are set to end the year below the level at which they started. There was a broad sell-off in technology stocks. Apple, which had earlier become the first company worth $1trn, tumbled. Google was slapped with a record €4.3bn ($5bn) fine by the European Commission. The bitcoin bubble burst.
The consolidation of media and telecommunications companies produced some of the year's blockbuster mergers, including a deal between T-Mobile and Sprint that valued the combined entity at $146bn. Rupert Murdoch's association with Sky, a British subscription-TV broadcaster that Mr Murdoch's company founded in 1989, ended after it was bought by Comcast.
Germany's government lost two state elections in which the far right gained. Angela Merkel, chancellor since 2005 and a stabilising force in Europe, said she would step down in 2021. Germany's consternation was compounded by its football team being knocked out in the early stage of the World Cup for the first time since 1938. France won the tournament.
One of the most bizarre stories of 2018 was the faked assassination of Arkady Babchenko, a Russian journalist and critic of the Kremlin, by Ukraine's intelligence services. Mr Babchenko's body was smeared with pig's blood and taken to a morgue while his ""murder"" was deplored by the world's media. His sudden appearance, alive, at a press conference dumbfounded his grieving friends and colleagues. Wisely, he had kept his wife in the loop, but he still apologised to her publicly.","America and China started a trade war , the world 's worst such dispute in decades .

CANBERRA
Female MPS complain of bullying and discrimination
IN NOVEMBER ONE of the rising stars of Australia's governing coalition, Julia Banks, shocked her colleagues by quitting the Liberal party to become an independent. She was sick, she said, of her party's ""cultural and gender bias, bullying and intimidation"". The announcement was a practical blow, further reducing the ranks of a government that was already a minority. But mainly it was an embarrassment, adding credence to the increasingly common complaint that the party is a slough of sexism. In January a second prominent Liberal, Kelly O'Dwyer, announced plans to resign. Last year she had complained that voters see her colleagues as ""homophobic, anti-women climate-change deniers"".
Less than a fifth of Liberal members of the lower house are women-a smaller proportion than 20 years ago. Conditions for the few who remain are rotten. Allegations of harassment have abounded since a moderate prime minister, Malcolm Turnbull, was overthrown in a right-wing coup in August. His redoubtable deputy, Julie Bishop, lost the leadership contest that followed, and several women complained of strong-arming by the putschists. Ms Bishop quit as foreign minister and returned to the backbenches, calling their behaviour ""appalling"". There is speculation that she too may resign before the general election due in May.
The Liberals have an inglorious record on these issues. During their most recent stint in opposition, several in their ranks subjected Australia's first and only female prime minister, Julia Gillard, to a torrent of abuse with sexist undertones. Ms Gillard, who is not married but lives with her partner, should ""make an honest woman of herself"", railed Tony Abbott, the Liberal leader at the time. He later gave a speech in front of posters that labelled Ms Gillard a ""witch"" and a Green senator's ""bitch"".
No party is spotless, however. Sarah Hanson-Young, another Green senator, is suing an independent opponent who directed her to ""stop shagging men"" during a recent debate on women's safety. Complaints of toxic masculinity hang over state and local government, too. Labor's leader in New South Wales resigned last year over allegations that he sexually harassed a journalist at a Christmas party.

Some politicians believe sexism can be curbed through a new code of parliamentary conduct. A better solution might be to draw more women into politics to start with. In the 1990s the Labor party introduced quotas guaranteeing that women would be selected as candidates in a steadily rising share of left-leaning seats. Almost half its MPS are now female, a nearly fivefold increase since this system was adopted. Labor's deputy leader, Tanya Plibersek, says this has altered attitudes in her party: ""When you have a critical mass, it's a better workplace for every woman.""
The Liberals have been slow to acknowledge their shortcomings. Some argue that verbal attacks are part of politics and female lawmakers should toughen up. Women in the party say their complaints are met with eye-rolling or accusations of ""hysteria"". The leadership rejects quotas on the basis that politicians should be chosen on merit. That is subjective, however, especially for new candidates. Women complain that good female ones are often rejected. ""Look at some of the men who have been pre-selected,"" scoffs one conservative. ""Don't tell me it's about merit.""
The Liberals have adopted a target to have equal numbers of male and female MPS by 2025. But unlike Labor's quotas, this goal is not binding. Few observers think it will be reached. Many of the Liberals' incumbent women hold marginal seats, which will be lost if the party is trounced in the impending election. So far, the Liberals have selected only six female candidates to contest safe conservative seats, by the count of William Bowe, a political analyst. At that rate, the party may emerge from the election even more male-dominated than it was to start with.","Australian politics

 Female MPS complain of bullying and discrimination 
 IN NOVEMBER ONE of the rising stars of Australia 's governing coalition , Julia Banks , shocked her colleagues by quitting the Liberal party to become an independent . She was sick , she said , of her party 's "" cultural and gender bias , bullying and intimidation "" . The announcement was a practical blow , further reducing the ranks of a government that was already a minority . But mainly it was an embarrassment , adding credence to the increasingly common complaint that the party is a slough of sexism . In January a second prominent Liberal , Kelly O'Dwyer , announced plans to resign . Last year she had complained that voters see her colleagues as "" homophobic , anti - women climate - change deniers "" . 
 Less than a fifth of Liberal members of the lower house are women - a smaller proportion than 20 years ago . Conditions for the few who remain are rotten . Allegations of harassment have abounded since Malcolm Turnbull was overthrown in a right - wing coup in August . Malcolm Turnbull's redoubtable deputy , Julie Bishop , lost the leadership contest that followed , and several women complained of strong - arming by the putschists . Ms Bishop quit as foreign minister and returned to the backbenches , calling their behaviour "" appalling "" . There is speculation that she too may resign before the general election due in May. 
 The Liberals have an inglorious record on these issues . During their most recent stint in opposition , several in their ranks subjected Australia 's first and only female prime minister , Julia Gillard , to a torrent of abuse with sexist undertones . Ms Gillard , who is not married but lives with her partner , should "" make an honest woman of herself "" , railed Tony Abbott , the Liberal leader at the time . He later gave a speech in front of posters that labelled Ms Gillard a "" witch "" and a Green senator 's "" bitch "" . 
 No party is spotless , however . Sarah Hanson - Young , another Green senator , is suing an independent opponent who directed her to "" stop shagging men "" during a recent debate on women 's safety . Complaints of toxic masculinity hang over state and local government , too . Labor 's leader in New South Wales resigned last year over allegations that he sexually harassed a journalist at a Christmas party . The mayor of Melbourne was toppled when two colleagues accused him of groping . ( Both men deny the claims . )

It cannot hope actually to become Asian. Thinking Australians, in business as well as in politics and the universities, know their country just does not look or feel or even smell like an Asian country. They also know the neighbours will never regard Australia as one of us"". Their aim instead is to make Australia the odd man in--a truly competitive country that is fully integrated into the economic life of the region. As anybody with a sense of history will recognise  the fact that Australians think themselves part of Asia  even to this limited extent  represents a remarkable change in attitudes. Not so long ago  Asians were looked down upon  with a mixture of pity  fear and contempt  as coolies paid starvation wages to produce shoddy goods to do Australian workers out of a job. Prohibitive tariffs blocked the import of Asian goods. A ""White Australia"" policy shut the door against Asian migrants. Political tub-thumpers whipped up patriotic fervour with gory talk of ""communist hordes"" and the ""yellow peril"". With the benefit of hindsight  it is possible to trace the start of the shift towards Asia to the Labor government of Gough Whitlam in 1972-75  which junked the White Australia policy  made the first big cut in tariffs (reversed by the government of Malcolm Fraser in 1975-83)  recognised China  North Vietnam and North Korea  withdrew troops from Vietnam and aid from Cambodia  and arraigned France in the International Court of justice for its nuclear tests in the Pacific. But the shift has really become decisive  and gathered speed  under the four successive Labor governments that have held power since 1983  under Bob Hawke until December 1991 and under Paul Keating  his Brutus  since then. Although their efforts to open up the economy are impressive  there is still a long way to go. The country continues to pay a stiff price for quarantining itself against Asia for so long. By making businesses slothful  protectionism against Asian competitors has depressed living standards. On the reckoning of Senator Gareth Evans  the foreign minister  Australia has fallen from first place in gross national product per head at the start of this century to 18th place. Its share of global trade has fallen by half since 1953  from 2.6% to around 1.3%. While Australia slumbered  the market economies and the managed-market economies of Asia took off. Excuses about coolie wages producing this economic miracle began to sound hollow when Japanese wages surpassed Australian ones; when the so-called Tigers (Hong Kong  Taiwan  Singapore and South Korea) and then Indonesia  Malaysia and Thailand made its economic growth rates seem puny; when Singapore's Lee Kuan Yew rudely predicted ""You'll become the poor white trash of Asia"". Mr Keating  an intellectual bruiser of the Denis Healey sort  said much the same thing in a different way when he warned in mid-1986 that the country was on course to being a banana republic. GREAT DISTRACTIONS Australians can be forgiven for taking such a long time to wake up to the consequences of their complacency. They may lag in the growth tables but the quality of their lives remains enviably high in an empty  egalitarian country that has as many people as Texas but is more than ten times as big. With magnificent sunshine and beaches like Sydney's Bondi and Perth's Mandurah  it is sometimes a wonder that anybody in Australia can be persuaded to do any work at all. The cities are civilised  with safe and lively downtown areas. Safety nets for the jobless  the mentally ill and other unfortunates remain in relatively good condition. So even today  with unemployment rates in double figures  you do not have to weave your way through beggars or step over homeless people. Few young Australians can be called yobs. Buildings are not habitually smeared with graffiti. Nor are cars casually vandalised. Violent crimes are less uncommon than they used to be  and provide blood-curdling copy for Melbourne's sensationalist tabloid  the Truth  but Australians on visits to the third-world inner cities of the United States quickly realise that theirs is still the lucky country. Along with the good life  historical ties of blood and kinship have also distracted Australia from its Asian economic destiny. Shortly after they ceased to be Britain's gulag  the Australian colonies became Empire loyalists. Boys in Melbourne and Sydney rushed to volunteer to fight in the Crimea. New South Wales sent 750 troops to the botched rescue of General Gordon in Khartoum. Australian soldiers helped subdue the Boers in the Transvaal and the Orange Free State. In the first world war and again in the second  Australia pledged itself to assist Britain to the last man and the last shilling and the last sheep. Quoting an old couplet  Robert Menzies  the country's longest-serving prime minister  was moved to say about the queen: ""I did but see her passing by  And yet I love her till I die"".  When the relative decline of Britain's military power persuaded Australia to turn more towards America  its loyalty to its new ally-cum-protector was hardly less intense. Australian troops served alongside Americans in the two hot wars of the cold-war period: Korea and Vietnam. And each Australian prime minister strove to be even more fulsomely pro-American than the last. Harold Holt  1966-67  pledged Australia to go ""All the Way with LBJ""; John Gorton  1968-71  assured the Americans ""We'll go a-waltzing Matilda with you"". William McMahon  1971-72  promised  still more unequivocally  ""Where you go  we go"". With diminishing fears of communist aggression abroad and communist subversion at home  Australia's governments are less subservient to the United States. George Bush got an earful about America's dumping wheat on world markets during his 66-hour stop in Australia on his Asian tour at the turn of the year. WESTERN VALUES  ASIAN ECONOMICS Whatever happens  even if it fully realises its ambition to be Asia's odd man in  Australia will remain firmly committed to western ideas and values--and so continue to vex some of its ASEAN neighbours (Singapore  Thailand  Malaysia  the Philippines  Brunei and Indonesia). They see it as a patronising  preachy country which just cannot resist patting heads and wagging fingers. Mathathir Moriammed  Malaysia's prime minister  worked himself into a lather in 1990 when the Australian government refused to censor a television series called ""Embassy""  set in a fictional foreign country  which  he said  mocked Malaysia. The Indonesian government was just as marked in 1991 by Australia's protests over the massacre of scores of unarmed demonstrators at Dili in East Timor. What right  Indonesian leaders asked  had Australia  a rich country with no threat to its internal security  to lecture a neighbour as it struggled to create a nation out of the former Dutch and Portuguese East Indies? Singapore  recently declared a chewing-gum-free zone by its disciplinarian government  much resents Australia's criticism of its harassment of the Asian Wall Street journal and other independent-minded newspapers. The strongmen of ASEAN will just have to get used to being scolded for such abuses. Culturally  Australia is set to remain a western country. Although Mr Keating is a robust republican  it may even remain under the notional wing of the queen. Depommification is passe. Young Australians are beginning to take pride in their heritage. Australia's new ambition to be Asia's odd man in comes from the mind  not the heart--it is a hardheaded response to the relentless pressures of economic logic. Asia is already Australia's largest market by far  taking more than half its merchandise exports. Japan by itself buys more Australian goods than the European Community and the United States do together. The ASEAN six buy more than the EC'S 12. The trend seems irreversible--and indeed might accelerate. Asia has a growing appetite for the crops  the meats and the metals Australia produces. In their agricultural trading policies  Europe and the United States are unwilling to accept a level ploughing field. Both anyway have other things on their mind. The EC is absorbed by its efforts to create a real internal market and to come to terms with post-communist Eastern Europe. The United States has signed a bilateral free-trade agreement with Canada that it wants to extend to Mexico. This represents a shift by the United States from its previous commitment to multilateralism  and its previous avoidance of bilateral preferential arrangements  that Senator Evans thinks is ""in its own way almost as significant as the breach of the Berlin Wall"". In short  with its old friends and relatives preoccupied  Australia has no alternative but to do more business with Asia. It has nowhere else to turn. But to prosper as Asia's odd man in  it will have to see that its economy becomes a lot more efficient than it is today. It has made a good start. TACTICAL LOSSES  STRATEGIC GAINS Purpose-built national capitals are always loathed. Australians have the same contempt for the bureaucrats and politicians of Canberra as Brazilians have for their government in Brasilia and Americans for theirs in Washington  DC. In Canberra's case  at least  the derision is ill-deserved. In the past decade  the authorities have got most of the big decisions right. True  they have made lots of tactical mistakes along the way. They intended to clear the ""clotted arteries"" of the financial system when they hurried to relax financial regulation  to license scores of new merchant banks and to admit 16 foreign banks (twice the number recommended in the Campbell report on the Australian financial system) into a sleepy commercial banking system. Instead they set off a bloody battle for market share where  in the words of Senator Peter Walsh  banks lent hundreds of millions ""without any mortgage security  without even asking how much was owed to other institutions  and without checking whether income streams could service borrowing costs."" Reluctant to tighten fiscal policy further  the authorities were guilty of another tactical error when  in the late 1980s  they relied solely on monetary policy to put an end to an inflationary boom. That boom had caused bank credit to careen out of control  property prices to soar and savings rates to plummet  and opened up a large current-account deficit that was financed by borrowing money from foreigners and selling Australian corporate assets to them. Interest rates hovered around 20% in 1988-90 to deepen and lengthen the recession that followed--hence the A$2.3 billion ($1.7 billion) fiscal tonic prescribed for an anaemic economy by Mr Keating. Nevertheless  a centrist Labor government dominated byeconomic rationalists has got the big strategic decisions right. Against most voters' expectations  and in flat contradiction to its own traditions  it has created a far more open economy than the one it inherited in 1983. There is still a long way to go  but  like an evangelist preacher  Australia can now boast: ""We ain't what we oughta be. We ain't what we're gonna to be. But  thank the Lord God Almighty  we ain't what we was."" The isolation of this vast land--what a historian  Geoffrey Blainey  has famously called ""the tyranny of distance""--had created a highly protectionist country. The ocean was Australia's first big trade barrier. Manufactured goods took so long to arrive by ship from Britain  and cost so much to transport  that by the mid-19th century Sydney  Melbourne and Hobart already had thriving import-substitution industries: coach builders  candle makers  foundries  breweries  textile mills and the like. After the Australian colonies federated in 1901  protectionism was entrenched by statute  not just in manufacturing but in banking  transport  telecommunications and just about everything else. Other countries  including the United States and much of continental Europe  were just as protectionist at the time  but Australia  with its small population and rich natural resources  was able to tolerate the costs of this economic inefficiency for much longer. As David Hale  of Kemper Financial Services in Chicago  has explained it in his shrewd analysis of the Australian economy  this protectionist trade policy produced a political culture based on rent seeking. The high tariffs guaranteed easy profits for the protected industries. These profits were then redistributed to the workers through a wage-distribution process that included features of the British system of craft-based unions as well as a centralised wage-arbitration court as ""uniquely Australian as the kangaroo."" As a result  the country developed a two-tier economy. The farmers and the miners provided the export income to pay for imports and to service debt. The protected manufacturing industries and inefficient state-owned service enterprises were used to spread the wealth produced by the export sector over a far larger number of people than were directly employed by the resource-based industries. Business commentators blamed the country's slow productivity growth and high inflation on the militancy of the trade unions. As Mr Hale says  they missed the point. The union leaders could not have pushed wages so high without trade protection. In the absence of tariffs  they would have pushed up unemployment. Protectionism was probably bound to collapse eventually under the weight of its inefficiency. With an increasing population and weaker prices for most commodities  especially agricultural products  a two-tier economy  with a competitive tier subsidising an uncompetitive one  was no longer affordable. But the policy-makers of Canberra--Australia's Sir Humphrey Applebys as well as the politicians--deserve praise for hurrying reform along. The Labor government has floated the dollar and abolished exchange controls. It has converted the Foreign Investment Review Board from a controller into a supporter--even a promoter--of foreign investment. It has allowed  correctly even if too hastily  foreign commercial and merchant banks to participate fully in what used to be a cocooned Australian banking system. Deregulation of the airlines has caused a massive drop in air fares  ending the nonsense whereby Sydneysiders found it cheaper to fly to holiday islands in the South Pacific than to the tropical north of Queensland or the national parks of Western Australia. In deregulating financial  transport and other services  and in privatising and partially privatising public enterprises  Australia's government acts pragmatically. It is not out to sell an ideology or to change Australians into a nation of small shareholding capitalists. The aim instead is greater efficiency  and Australia's reformers have learnt from Britain's pioneering experience that competition  not change in ownership  is the key to that. As they see it  British Petroleum was just as efficient when it was partially owned by the British government as it was once it became fully privatised. In both guises  it was subject to the full rigours of competition and run as a corporate enterprise. British Telecom  in contrast  is a quasi-monopoly that has continued since privatisation to provide poor service by the standards of America  where AT&T (the old Ma Bell)  MCI  Sprint and others compete on long-distance calls and the Baby Bells  the local carriers  are strictly regulated. In trade negotiations  Australians no longer have to talk with forked tongues: to demand free trade for farm products while defending high tariffs on manufactured goods. As will become plain when this survey looks later at manufacturing  Australia is on its way to free trade by the end of this century in all goods except cars and its still woefully uncompetitive textiles  clothing and footwear. NEW SETTLERS AND BETTER SCHOOLS These changes for the better have all been noticed abroad  at least on the business pages. Just as radical changes in immigration and education policies have won less attention. Yet in the long term they may do as much as economic liberalisation to help Australia hold its own in competition against the Asian super-achievers. The slogan ""populate or perish"" is now a quaint memory. So is the warning in 1947 by Arthur Calwell  a long-time leader of the Labor Party  that ""we have 25 years at most to populate this country before the yellow races are down upon us"". The old White Australia immigration policy  with its Ten-Pound Poms  is dead and buried. Australia has also lost its enthusiasm for factory fodder-unskilled migrants who were bused up to the Snowy Mountains hydro-electric scheme or the steelworks of Broken Hill. Nowadays it looks for immigrants with skills that are in short supply  and it prefers them young. Bus drivers and dressmakers are not wanted. Anybody over 40 has lead in his saddlebags. Exception is made only for political refugees and  under the family-reunion provisions  migrants with close relatives in Australia. In a region where the admission policies of most countries  with the outstanding exception of New Zealand  have an explicit or implicit racial bent  Senator Evans can brag that in every year since the late 1970s between a third and a half of Australia's migrants have been from Asia and the Pacific. More than 600 000 people of Asian descent now live in Australia  3.5% of the population  and immigration is expected to help swell it to 7% by 2010. Australia is so proud of its enlightened policies towards Asian newcomers that its immigration minister  Gerry Hand  did not know whether to be amused or offended when he was told recently by Britain's home secretary  Kenneth Baker  that Hong Kong was lucky Britain was taking 50 000 families and ""the colonies (sic) should take a lot more"". An unemployment rate in double figures has put pressure on the govemrnent to reduce the inflow of migrants from the 131 500 admitted in 1989-90 and the 123 500 in 1990-91. But whatever happens Australia will not compromise its ambition to be odd man in by once more discriminating against Asians. Like its old immigration policies  Australia's old education policies also swelled the ranks of an unemployable Lumpenproletariat. Somehow a way had to be found to increase the number of children staying on at school past the age that schooling was compulsory: 15 or 16  depending on the state. Against heavy odds in a country where secondary education is mainly a matter for the individual states  Australia has done it by requiring schoolleavers to wait longer before they qualify for the dole and by awarding grants  based on family income  for children who continue their schooling. At first  the scheme provoked scorn. Critics said the grants would merely provide a better quality Chardonnay for parents who had decided their children would stay on at school anyway. The government was right to ignore the scoffers. The proportion of children who complete 12 years of schooling has doubled  from 35% to 70% and is still rising. Secular schools in some states are starting to demand hard work and decent behaviour from their pupils  just as the Catholic Church's schools  which educate about one-fifth of Australian children  have always done. The high retention rate is likely to continue even when unemployment declines. Except in Tasmania  where it is still the done thing for boys to drop out  teenagers think it is cool to stay on at school. DR HEWSON'S ELIXIR The country will not reverse the broad sweep of its policies if it changes governments in the general election that must be called bv early next year. To be sure  there are differences of emphasis. The opposition Liberal Party  headed by John Hewson  is less liberal on immigration (and susceptible to occasional racist flurries)  less generous on overseas aid and less inclined to kowtow to China. But it is at one with the Labor governments of Messrs Hawke and Keating in aiming to make Australia an open  competitive economy that can prosper as Asia's odd man in. The big differences are over means  not ends. In opposition  the Liberals  who are allied with the National Party (the old Country Party)  had a choice. They could occupy the same middle ground as the Labor Party and count on a bored electorate to vote out a government that had served four consecutive terms in office. Or they could promise to go further and faster than even an intrepid Labor government dared go. Under the leadership of Mr Hewson it was inevitable that the Liberals would choose the bolder course. He entered politics to get things done  not to make a name for himself. Unlike Mr Hawke  but like Mr Keating  a prime minister respected more by the press than the public  Mr Hewson is not a natural politician. When he mixes with the people he often looks as awkward as a corporate treasurer at an office party for the cleaning staff. He has imbibed the economic orthodoxies and certainties of the early Thatcher years and is impatient above all to change Australia's taxes so that they promote savings and investment. The Labor government is also keen to persuade Australians to save more  but the Liberal-National coalition is on its own in prescribing as a remedy a massive shift from direct to indirect taxes. In a policy document  called ""Fightback""  it is committed to introduce a 15% goods and services tax (roughly equivalent to what Europeans call a value-added tax) and to use the money raised to scrap the wholesale-tax system and to cut income taxes. On the basis of some heroic assumptions  Mr Hewson's economic gurus reckon the change will add only 5% or so to retail prices. They also reckon  in a triumph of hope over British experience  that something like a value-added tax will convert a nation of profligate spenders into thrifty savers. Bernie Fraser  the governor of the central bank  is among the sceptics. He fears that such a drastic change in the tax system could prove ill-timed and divisive--and  above all  put at risk Australia's success in tugging its rate of inflation below the OECD average. For this  among other reasons  Mr Hewson hopes  if he becomes prime minister  to put somebody more accommodating into the central bank. He had better prepare himself for a fight. Mr Fraser is famous for speaking his mind--politicians  he says  ""can stuff things up pretty effectively""--and he thinks an independent  or at least quasi-independent  central bank is essential to the country's economic well-being. Mr Fraser won't go: he has  he says  no intention of resigning from his fixed term to appease ""some dickhead minister"". Unless somebody blinks  a confrontation looms. A Hewson government's labour policy could be even more contentious. Australia still has one of the most heavily regulated labour markets in the OECD and its trade unions are infamous for their restrictive practices. ""Put two Japanese workers together and you get the synergy of three  grumbles one frustrated businessman. Put two Australians together and you get a demarcation dispute."" in the maritime and waterfront industries  the militancy of the unions is legendary. When the Soviet Union celebrated the 70th anniversary of the October Revolution in 1987  Sydney wharfies sent a telegram to the dockers of Leningrad that said in part: ""In seven decades of struggle and magnificent achievements  the working people of the Soviet Union  under the banner of Lenin's Party  have built a highly developed socialist society  which guarantees economic security and a full and rewarding life."" What the wharfies call ""a heritage of hatred"" has indeed caused massive problems for Australia's exporters. But it is a mistake to generalise or trivialise from the particular. Bill Kelty  the head of the Australian Council of Trade Unions (AcTu)  believes in a ""pragmatic and adaptive union movement"" and knows businesses need bigger profits to finance more investment to create jobs. In its incomes policy  an antipodean version of the old Swedish model  the Labor government has worked with the rational majority of trade unionists to keep wage increases moderate and to link them more directly to improvements in productivity. Even Labor cabinet members concede that progress is slow. Restrictive practices remain entrenched. Dinkum Australian companies still find it impossible to negotiate the sort of deal for a single union recently concluded by Toyota with the ACTU for a new factory in Victoria. Craft unions still resist government efforts to persuade them to amalgamate into industrial unions. Nonetheless  Mr Hewson's party is taking a high risk in promising to do as much as is constitutionally proper to weaken the legal rights and industrial muscle of the unions. It is  for instance  committed to abolishing the tax-exempt status of the unions  ending the practice of deducting union dues from the salaries of employees in the public sector and promoting ""voluntary unionism"". Prolonged labour disruption is only too likely if anything like this happens. Work practices in ships and on docks certainly need changing  but a government that bashes all trade unionists for the sins of a few will invite a backlash. The same combination of mateyness and combativeness that makes Australians the world's best rugby players  and so reluctant to salute their military superiors  also makes them hard for politicians to push around. Those in Mr Hewson's Liberal Party who would prefer a slower  surer pace of tax and labour reform point across the Tasman  where New Zealand has little but economic stagnation to show for six years of radical restructuring. Jim Bolger  the prime minister of New Zealand's National Party government  is getting the blame-rather unfairly since a Labour government initiated the restructuring. He is about as popular as a pork pie in a mosque. MANUFACTURERS' LAMENT In seeking to return their country to full employment  Australians of the left  right and centre put their faith in a revitalised manufacturing industry to create lots more jobs. Their faith is illfounded  and not just because employment in manufacturing is in decline in most OECD countries. Manufacturing companies will bear the brunt of greater foreign competition  particularly from Asian rivals  as trade barriers decline. Fortunately  unless the industrial world moves emphatically towards managed trade  this is unlikely to cause either the Labor government or the Opposition to have second thoughts about the merits of open markets. If anything  the Liberal-National parties  traditionally kneejerk protectionists  seem even more determined than the Labor government to see that no Asian neighbour can ever again justly complain  as did Singapore's Lee Kuan Yew a decade ago  that Australia is ""more restrictive  conservative and backward-looking (in its industrial protection policies) than the meanest of the EC countries."" Free traders have won the debate among policy makers  and among the intellectual elites in the universities  the think-tanks and the newspapers. Though opinion polls show most Australians still hanker for protectionism  lobbyists for hardpressed manufacturers  like the Metals Trade industry Association  find it hard to get a hearing when they bellow for a halt to tariff cuts lest the country end up an industrial wasteland. Ross Garnaut  who advised Mr Hawke on trade policy  may have over-egged the pudding when he claimed  in an article published in international Economic Insights  an influential American economics joumal  that international trade and payments in Australia are set by the mid-1990s to be less fettered by government intervention than in any other OECD country today. But the progress the country has made since Mr Lee's outburst cannot be gainsayed. In line with its policy to make Australia ""an outward-looking community  enmeshed with the dynamism of the Asia Pacific Region""  the labor government is committed to cutting the average tariff for most imports to 5% by 2000  compared with 20% when Labor won power in 1983. The exceptions are cars  where the tariff has already come down from 100% to 35%  and is due to be cut to 25% by 1996 and to 15% by 2000  and textiles  clothing and footwear  where the tariff is due to be cut from 40% this year to 25% by 2000. Mr Hewson promises to reduce tariffs further  faster. Many Australian businesses will not survive the necessary restructuring. The country's manufacturing base is too broad and too shallow as a direct consequence of border protection. For instance  Australia  with fewer people than either California or New York  has five car makers: General Motors  Ford  Toyota  Nissan and Mitsubishi. With such small body-runs  it is simply not possible for that many manufacturers to prosper if tariffs decline to 25%  let alone 15%. Nissan Australia  which lost A$125m in 1990-91  has already seen the writing on the tariff wall. It has given notice it will cease local production in October  walking away from much of the A$1 billion it has invested since 1987. Cars are an extreme case in point  but the same challenge is facing most manufacturers. Many of them  especially those in labour-intensive industries  will go down the gurgler. The best the country can hope for is to be left with a narrower  deeper manufacturing base that has made itself fit not just to survive but to thrive in open competition against Asia's super-achievers. The fundamental change this will require in Australia's business culture was apparent at the most recent of the seminars for institutional investors held in New York each year by McIntosh Hamson Hoare Govett  an Australian brokerage house. Speaker after speaker assured the moneymen that Australian companies had learnt a hard lesson from the excesses of the 1980s--that they no longer deserved to be caricatured as poorly managed and over-geared  with bushranger ethics. From conversations overcoffee and cocktails  it was clear that the audience remained sceptical  and understandably so. Good business sense and good business ethics were in short supply everywhere in the 1980s; but Australia took the biscuit. Even now it is hard to credit how investors and bankers threw such enormous sums of money at such implausible optimists. RUE THE DAY Most visible are the excesses of the property speculators. They have filled downtown Sydney  Melbourne and Perth with see-through office blocks that were supposed to be occupied by financial institutions and corporate head offices. Financed by other people's money  Western Australia's Alan Bond  a beefy property speculator turned entrepreneur  was for a while the world's most famous billionaire. He owned his country's biggest media company and a large multinational brewery  as well as van Gogh's ""Irises"". Many Western Australians reckon Mr Bond could have been elected prime minister of their state after 200 000 people lined the streets of Perth to cheer him when his yacht won the America's Cup for Australia in 1983. Only when his business empire collapsed did the fanciful nature of his dealings became plain for all to see. After examining a complex contract under which Bond Brewing would sell the Sydney Hilton to a Singaporean businessman  an exasperated judge in Victoria's Supreme Court exclaimed: ""In some respects  it has been like dealing simultaneously with a slippery eel and a very large and active octopus."" The backers of other failed businessmen were scarcely less credulous. Christopher Skase's Qintex collapsed owing about A$2 billion after attempting to take over the American film studio then known as MGM/UA Communications. Mr Skase declared personal bankruptcy and left Australia to live in a handsome villa in Majorca. Another supreme optimist  Laurie Connell of Rothwells merchant bank  continued to enjoy the confidence of the state government of Western Australia for a remarkably long time after Perth businessmen nicknamed him ""Last Resort"" Laurie for his willingness to lend money to people everybody else dismissed as uncreditworthy. Warwick Fairfax  then a precocious twentysomething  was able in 1987 to finance an all-too-generous takeover of his family's newspaper empire  whose titles include the Sydney Morning Herald and the Age in Melbourne. The newspapers did not make enough money to service the debt  and Conrad Black's Tourang syndicate was able to pick up the pieces in 1991. Australia's moneymen are not short of excuses for the financial backers of Messrs Bond  Skase  Connell  Fairfax and other failed entrepreneurs. Prudent brokers  they say  lost clients to imprudent competitors. Commercial bankers' salaries  bonuses and promotion prospects were tied to performance. The more they lent  the more they made. Cautious merchant bankers were shoved aside by colleagues who were gung-ho to underwrite junk bonds and to promote aggressive takeovers  highly leveraged buyouts and various creative financing packages. GET RICH SLOW Australia's regulators really do seem better equipped today to curb such nonsense. The Australian Stock Exchange has stiffened its listing requirements and disclosure rules. A federal regulator  the Australian Securities Commission  has replaced the amateurish and fragmented National Companies and Securities Commission  which reported to individual state governments and had a budget one-tenth as large as its successor. Financial prudence seems to be back in favour and the country's best businesses now accept there are no short cuts to prosperity. ""International best practice"" is the buzz phrase of the moment and many companies are engaged in drastic restructuring to reduce their gearing  improve their balance sheet and increase efficiency. Several regret the diversification moves they made in the 1980s and are determined in future to avoid businesses they do not understand. Pioneer international  the world's second-largest producer of concrete  admits it became ""a victim of paranoia"" in the 1980s when it spent money on acquisitions to make itself less attractive to Robert Holmes a Court  a big shareholder it viewed as a potential predator. In deciding to concentrate again on its core businesses  Pioneer has got out of both mining and oil exploration. Foster's Brewing Group has also decided to stick to its knitting. It has already got out of grains and wool and is poised to rid itself of all its remaining agribusinesses as prices improve. In a radical reorganisation  Amatil sold its tobacco interests to become Coca-Cola Amatil--a business centred on snack foods and beverages that is 51% owned by Coca-Cola. Goodman Fielder Wattie  Australia's largest food company  has sold its non-core businesses in getting out of engineering  mining  starch making  canning and fishing. Companies are also slimming their workforces as they concentrate on doing what they do best and seek to improve productivity. The changes are accompanied by  and are contributing to  a shift away from manufacturing to services and from the heavy-industrial heartland of Victoria to Queensland  New South Wales and Western Australia. Along with the few Australian businesses that are true multinationals  like TNT in transport  Foster's in beers and Pacific Dunlop in opportunistic manufacturing  the companies most likely to prosper are those adding value to Australia's mining and agricultural output or serving foreign tourists. As it integrates itself more into the world economy  and into an Asian economy super-competitive in manufacturing  Australia's comparative advantage will lie more than ever in its natural resources and its natural beauty. RED TAPE  GREEN TAPE  BLACK TAPE The mines already sell most of what they produce to Asians but say they could up and sell a lot more if only the bureaucrats  the environmentalists and the Aboriginals would let them. Listen  for instance  to Roderick Kinkead-Weekes  managing director of Hamersley Iron  the country's largest iron-ore producer and a 100%-owned subsidiary of CRA (which is in turn 49%-owned by RTZ). He wistfully recalls how Hamersley  then a company with a couple of tents on a beach  was able to put in a mine  a railway and a port  and to build two towns  Tom Price and Dampier  in Western Australia within a period of 18 months in the mid-1960s. Today  he says  it would take Hamersley 18 months just to get development approval from the authorities. Only if the company was extraordinarily lucky  says Peter Ellery  chief executive of Western Australia's chamber of mines. Many projects in Western Australia  the state that produces about half the country's exports of ore  fuels  gold and other metals  have been subjected to interminable delays. In the three years to the end of 1991  proposals by mining companies involving more than A$2.5 billion in capital investment were put on hold. The chamber quotes chapter and verse to support its complaint  and a stung state government has promised to do what it can to spur decisions. A A$150m rare-earths project proposed by Rhone-Poulenc at Pinjarra was blocked when the company had difficulty gaining environmental approval for the project. A A$1.5 billion coal mine and related power station proposed by Canning Resources at Hill River were initially delayed by government indecision. Part of the coal resources were then quarantined within the boundaries of a national park. Aboriginal-heritage issues blocked a A$350m nickel mine proposed by Dominion Mining at Yakabindie and a A$500m iron-ore development by Hamersley Iron at Marandoo. Lobbying by environmentalists and not-in-my-backyard citizens over road and power supplies deferred the A$135m Beenup mineral-sands project. Similar horror stories are told by miners in other states  but none has gained Australia as much notoriety among investors abroad as the cock-up over Coronation Hill. This is a gold  platinum and palladium mine that Newcrest Mining  a subsidiary of Australia's BHP and America's Newmont Mining  wanted to open on a conservation site next to Kakadu National Park in the Northern Territory. Newcrest's mining lease at Coronation Hill was  in effect  torn up when Mr Hawke's cabinet reversed its policy and decided the mine would impinge on the sacred sites of the Jawoyn Aboriginal tribe. Not only Newcrest was outraged by the ""expropriation of its mining rights"". Bankers warned that foreign investors would  for the first time in Australian history  have to ponder ""sovereign risk"" before investing in the country. MIM  the owner of the Hilton and Mt Isa mines in Queensland  predicted that mining companies would transfer their prospecting efforts to other places where they encountered less bureaucratic red tape  environmental green tape and tribal black tape. The industry's opponents see things differently. Radical Aboriginals assert that white Australia has treated their lives  land  customs and religious rites with as little respect as white America showed the Indians. Environmentalists say that much of Australia is incredibly fragile. They note  for instance  how tracks left by military vehicles during the second world war are still visible in the vast deserts at the centre of the continent. From their viewpoint  the mining companies are not much better than vandals. The century-old gold mine at Kalgoorlie in Western Australia is a notorious example of the damage mines can do to the environment. Even mining executives admit that until Kalgoorlie started to clean itself up four or five years ago  and moved its roasters out of town  ""it looked like Hiroshima after the bomb"". The mine and the miners had denuded the land of trees for miles around and a smelter adjacent to the mine belched all sorts of nasty substances into the lungs of the miners' families  including high concentrates of sulphur dioxide. When miners promise to behave better in the future  the environmentalists simply do not believe them. There is no rational debate  no meeting of minds. The green movement has not entered into the political mainstream as it has in Western Europe and the United States. Cranks are too influential and they join forces with radical Aboriginals to sabotage any and every Outback project. It never occurs to them to ponder why the countries with the poorest economic performances tend to have the worst environmental records. Geoffrey Blainey is not being unfair when he says these dark greens ""think they are living in a canary cage--they imagine that they only have to chirp and the birdseed will arrive."" Some of the Aboriginals are as unreasonable as the dark greens. The mining companies are willing to accept that there is a large number of Aboriginal sites of cultural significance scattered throughout the country. They just want to be told where they are so that their prospectors can avoid them. Nothing doing  say radical Aboriginals. We are not going to divulge the whereabouts of our religious sites. You tell us where you plan to open a mine  then we will tell you whether it is a sacred place. In the interests of all  not just the miners  Australia's rational majority needs to think more about the Outback  and to introduce greater balance into the debate on preservation versus development. Unfortunately  the odds against this happening are high. Australian men like to think of themselves as bushrangers  and to drive about in rugged trucks equipped with roo bars  but they are lost in the wild. Most cannot tell one tree or bird or snake from another  or make a fire outdoors  let alone cook over it. Australians are among the most urbanised (and suburbanised) people on earth: four-fifths of them live in and around coastal cities. with barely 80 000 people  Ballarat  the gold-rush town where lucky prospectors played skittles with bottles of French champagne and lit cigars with five-pound notes  is among the most populous of the inland cities. As Henry Lawson  Australia's favourite poet  once put it: Further out may be the pleasant scenes of which our poets boast But I think the country's rather more inviting round the coast. Anyway  I'll stay at present at a boarding house in town Drinking beer and lemon squashes  taking baths and cooling down. ADDED VALUE A truce with the environmentalists would do much to spur exploration  and to bring more mines on stream faster  but it would remove just one of the obstacles that prevent the mining industry ""adding value""--a phrase intoned like a mantra in Australia. As applied to the mining industry  it means increasing export earnings by moving along the production chain: from  for example  the export of bauxite to the export of alumina to the export of aluminium to the export of pots and pans. If it sounds too simple a solution  it is. Where ""adding value"" can be done at a decent profit  it is already being done. Whatever their other shortcomings  Australia's big mining houses are not myopic. They are capital intensive  well managed and technologically innovative. They also have strong balance sheets. Shaken by an earlier boom-bust cycle  they went into the recession of 1990-91 with a lighter debt load than the manufacturers. High energy prices deter the big mining houses from adding value in Western Australia. Power costs there are 40% higher than in the east. Distance is another deterrent. Western Australia has fewer than 2m people scattered over a state five times the size of France. Perth  its only big city  lacks the manufacturing base of Melbourne and Sydney. Some inland mines in Queensland have even greater geographical handicaps. The high cost of transport is another deterrent to adding value  but at least the government could do something about this  if only it would summon up the political will. Most of Australia's unions are led by economic rationalists  but the maritime unions are a horrible exception. The manning levels and other restrictive practices they have imposed on ships that ply Australian ports have made intra-coastal shipping prohibitively expensive. It costs five times as much to ship salt from north-western Australia to Fremantle in Western Australia as it costs to ship it to Japan. Even with such nonsensical labour practices  it is hard to be pessimistic about Australian mining. The mining industry provides only 7% of Australia's GNP but over 50% of its merchandise (ie  visible) exports. It has vast  under-exploited resources and is better placed than its big competitors to supply the Asian countries that currently possess the fastest-growing economies on earth. But Australian mining will not realise its full potential so long as such nonsensical practices are allowed to persist. DUMPED UPON Rural Australia's ever-increasing dependence on Asia owes less to decisions taken in Canberra than to decisions taken in Brussels and Washington  DC. Australia's farmers  who export four-fifths of their production  had hoped while expanding their sales to Asia to retain their other markets. The lethal combination of protectionism at home and predatory pricing abroad by the European Community and the United States has forced them into an Asian redoubt. When it comes to beggar-thy-neighbour policies on agriculture  the EC is an even worse offender than America. The high internal support prices and import barriers of its common agricultural policy (CAP) first squeezed Australian farmers out of a British market they had supplied for more than a century. In the 20 years since Britain signed the Treaty of Rome  Australian butter has disappeared from British supermarket shelves and exports of Australian beef have declined from 120 000 tonnes a year to Britain to 5 000 tonnes a year to all 12 countries of the EC. Exports to the United States of Australian beef  as well as of sugar and dairy products  are limited by quotas. After squeezing Australian foods out of the EC  the CAP started squeezing them out of third markets as well. In an effort to reduce a 1m tonne stockpile of beef to manageable proportions  the EC sold boneless beef into the Middle East at $500-600 a tonne  compared with a free-market price of around $3 000 tonne. European wheat was also dumped on world markets at prices subsidised down to levels that guaranteed bankruptcy for any unsubsidised rivals daft enough to try to compete. The Australian government instructed its diplomats to complain to European governments; but it was long loth to do more  lest the EC reconsider the promise it made in 1985 not to extend export subsidies to Australia's markets in north and east Asia. By late 1991  with rural Australia in its worst recession since (by some measures) the Great Depression  the Department of Trade and Foreign Affairs (the two functions were integrated in 1987) decided even that risk was worth running. Embassies were told to send a provocative 12-page booklet entitied: ""Are you paying too much?"" to potential European troublemakers-trade unions  consumer groups  environmental lobbyists and so on. The answer  supported by lots of cute tables and charts  is that European consumers are paying substantially more than they need for food because the CAP does not permit the benefits of low food prices on international markets to flow through into the prices in the shops. A comparison of typical food prices rams home the point (see table on next page). (Table omitted) American agricultural dumping and protectionism are less egregious than the EC's but have angered Australian farmers even more  as President Bush learnt when he stopped in Australia on his way to Asia in January. Rural Australia had taken seriously America's tub-thumping on free trade in the Uruguay round of GATT negotiations and so was shocked to discover the Bush administration could  under America's Export Enhancement Programme  out-subsidise the EC on grains. It was also apparent that the White House was determined to stave off the threat of open markets for America's internationally uncompetitive farmers--its ranchers  sugar growers  dairymen and so on. Coming on top of a world recession and a severe drought  the distortion of prices in the world commodity markets by the United States and the EC caused three-quarters of Australia's 80 000 broadacre farms to lose money in the 1990-91 season. The fast pace of productivity growth these farms have maintained over the past few years is threatened by the erosion of their capital base and their inability to afford new equipment. They are  for instance  replacing grain harvesters at the rate of just once every 100 years. Clumsy mismanagement of the market for apparel wool  where Australia  with up to 150m (mostly merino) sheep  has a 65-70% share of world trade  has made matters worse. In 1988-91 the Australian Wool Corporation bought a massive part of the wool clip in an increasingly desperate attempt to hold a floor price. When  in January 1991  it was forced by the weight of speculation to withdraw from the market  it was left with a stockpile that will take several years to sell. Even so  it is as hard to be a long-term pessimist about Australia's farms as it is about its mines. True  the country lacks the great river systems that opened up the interior of the United States  watered its farms and provided cheap river-transport for its produce to the seaports. Much of Australia's interior is so and it is next to useless. Farms the size of Rhode Island support 6 000 sheep  which walk a day between mouthfuls. Then  after years of drought  there is a flash flood that washes the flock away. No wonder pioneers filled their maps with such dismal names: Mount Hopeless  Lake Disappointment  Mount Desolation. Nonetheless  the pros easily exceed the cons. A small population means cheap land  and Australia is able profitably to practise low-input  low-output agriculture. Its ""clean  green"" produce is environmentally sound: Australian farmers can get away with using far less pesticides  fungicides  herbicides and all those other cides that European and American farmers spray so liberally on their fields. Most Australian farmers are not subsidised by the taxpayers and  with the power of their remaining statutory marketing systems being eroded  they are more exposed to market prices than the mollycoddled farmers of Europe and America. They sometimes grumble about this--like farmers everywhere they would like to capitalise their profits and socialise their losses. But it makes for self-reliant farmers who are fully exposed  and so respond quickly  to changes in prices. Their potential market in Asia looks limitless. Much of the region already lacks enough agricultural land to feed its people  and rapid urbanisation and population growth are reducing the supply of farmland further. Asian diets are also changing in ways that benefit the Australian farmers  with people eating more wheat and more meat. Who knows  they may even begin to drink Australia's wines. These are unrecognisable from the days they were sold as plonk under the Empire wine label in Britain. Today they offer better value than similarly priced Californian and French wines. Like mining  agriculture needs to add value fully to exploit its comparative advantage. Australia could  for instance  increase the value of its hardwood timber several fold by exporting it as furniture. Some value-adding can be done without manufacturing. Beef from range-fed cattle is less sought after in Japan than the marbled beef from cattle finished on feedlots. Sometimes an acre of good wheatland is more productive when a farmer switches from growing low-protein wheat for Egypt to growing higher-priced noodle wheat for Japan. Again like mining  agriculture would benefit from an attack by all governments  state as well as federal  on restrictive labour practices. At super-efficient  bulk-handling grain terminals  redundant dockers continue to get paid overtime as well as regular time to sit about playing gin rummy. The cost of loading a ship with rice at some Australian ports is equal to the total cost of shipping rice from Thailand to Europe. At slaughterhouses workers are paid 50% more for killing and dressing ram lambs than wether (ie  castrated) lambs. In consequence  Australia has priced itself out of a niche market for ram lambs in the Middle East. Unlike the miners  however  the farmers are not natural adversaries of the environmentalists. They too have a vested interest in halting  and where possible reversing  the degradation of the land  and they know they have their work cut out. Over-grazing has ruined much of Australia's best farmland. Salination caused by over-irrigation has turned once-fertile fields barren. Land reform could help improve land management. Many pastoral leascs promote over-grazing by giving the leaseholder the right to graze stock  period. The leases do not permit farmers to clear the land or to diversify into timber or crops or even tourism. The absentee landlords  many of whom live in Britain and America  might become more accommodating if govemment imposed prohibitive stamp duties on unduly restrictive leases. The urgency of labour  land and other reforms is misunderstood by those urbane  urban economists  in Canberra and elsewhere  who like to think agriculture will loom far less large in the future than it has in the past. Rural Australia accounts for only 3-4% of the gross national product; but even when handicapped by an agricultural slump  and by egregious dumping by the United States and the EC  it still produces about a quarter of Australia's merchandise exports. STUNNING VIEW Australians would have to try hard to make a hash of their tourist business. Their country can look forward to a massive surplus in the tourist accounts of its balance of payments as more foreigners discover that Paul Hogan and now Greg Norman  those matey blonds who plug their country's charms in television commercials  are if anything guilty of under-statement. And it says something for Australian patriotism that both Mr Hogan and Mr Norman agreed to do the commercials for nothing. Millions more foreigners would like to come to Australia than can afford to: such successes as ""Crocodile Dundee""  an adventure-comedy film  ""Thorn Birds""  a steamy novel  and ""Neighbours""  a television soap  have caught the popular imagination. But mass tourism on the Majorca and Miami Beach model is just not possible in Australia  even if it was desired. Distances make the country expensive to get to (a flight from New York or London to Sydney takes almost 24 hours) and it is also expensive to travel around. So Australia has to try to attract the sort of affluent visitors who are happy to spend a day exploring the tropical rainforest but want a chilled white wine served with barramundi for dinner  not baked beans cooked over an open fire. Australia is fortunate that the distances are less intimidating for East Asians (Cairns is closer to Japan than Honolulu is) and that incomes in several East Asian countries are rising far faster than in Europe and the United States. Fewer Americans have visited Australia in each of the past three years than in 1988  when 352 300 went there; but the number of visitors from Asia continues to rise in both absolute and proportional terms. Tony Thirlwell  the managing director of the Australian Tourist Commission  predicts that the total number of tourists will rise from under 2.5m in 1991 to 6.5m in 2000 and that  by then  half of the sightseers will come from East Asia. It helps that Qantas  Australia's national carrier  has an outstanding safety record: it has never had an accident that has killed a passenger. Increased competition reinforced by deregulation has forced Qantas to cut air fares drastically on some routes  particularly domestic ones  and it is losing money. But John Ward  its chief executive  swears his airline will not repeat the mistake made by deregulated airlines in the United States and permit lower fares to cause it to lower standards of service to its passengers. Qantas worries more about blocks to growth in tourism beyond its control. Runways and approach paths in the region are not yet as congested as those at New York's Kennedy and La Guardia  or London's Heathrow  but congestion is growing and is especially acute in Tokyo  Sydney  Brisbane  Bangkok and Hong Kong. Australian hotels are among the dearest in the Asia-Pacific Basin. South Africa is another blot on the landscape: Australia's tourist operators worry that South Africa has more exciting wild animals to offer and could lure their visitors away if its achievement of greater political respectability is followed by greater political stability. The worries are overdone. Australia offers outstanding value for money for visitors keen on an outdoors holiday of one sort or another. Those interested in museums  mausoleums and colosseums should go elsewhere: Australia's oldest buildings date back less than 200 years to its days as a depository for Britain's criminals. Hence the rhyme so popular among Australia's earliest settlers: The law locks up the man or woman Who steals the goose from the common  But leaves the greater villain loose Who steals the common from the goose. For Asians  and especially the Japanese  the big attractions are the beaches  the golf courses and  increasingly  the theme parks on Queensland's Gold Coast. They also like to go in groups to see such natural wonders as Ayers Rock  the world's largest monolith  and the nightly commute of fairy penguins at Phillip Island in Victoria. Like Asians  many Americans also reconfirm their national stereotype. They try to see as much of Australia as possible as quickly as possible (""if this is Tuesday  it must be Queensland""). However  among visitors from both America and Europe  though not yet from Asia  there is a new mass phenomenon: eco-tourism. Eco-tourists are interested in native cultures as well as wildlife  and the travel industry is scratching for ways sensitively to exploit their fascination for the religious rites  art and artefacts of the Aboriginals. For wildlife  they need only to point the way into the bush. The national parks are wonderfully unspoilt  and filled with animals that hop instead of walk. At Wilsons Promontory National Park  at the southern-most tip of the continent  across the Bass Strait from Tasmania  the sandy beaches are so clean it is almost a shame to tread on them. On a day's trek along remote paths in the national park  hikers come across more snakes than people. Nature cannot  however  be left to take care of itself. Many animals are on the brink of extinction. Destruction of their habitat and the introduction by European settlers of despoilers and fierce predators (feral cats and dogs as well as foxes  water buffafoes and rabbits) have put great pressure on some of the smaller marsupials. But the country has an abundance of kangaroos--3m by one count in Western Australia alone--and it is not hard to see koalas  wombats  wallabies and crocodiles. Birds are the greatest of Australia's natural wonders. At a park in downtown Sydney  a short stroll from the Opera House  the sharp-sighted can quickly spot some of the world's most spectacular birds: galahs  rosellas  sulphur-crested cockatoos  rainbow lorikeets and superb fairy-wrens. And the birdlife of the outback is rich beyond most birdwatchers' imaginings. DEFEATING THE WOWSERS Much of the world sees Australia through the eyes of its golden oldies: Germaine Greer  John Pilger  Clive James  Robert Hughes  Jill Ker Conway prominent among them. More's the pity. Too many of Australia's older intellectuals and quasi-intellectuals have a chip on their shoulders and those who have made their lives and livelihoods abroad are largely unaware of just how much their country has changed--mostly for the better. Customs officers no longer search travellers' bags for copies of ""Peyton Place"" and ""The Carpetbaggers"". Or for the books of William Burroughs and Henry Miller. Book censorship collapsed after the case brought against Philip Roth's ""Portnoy's Complaint"" ended in a sea of giggles. More than 20 years have passed since beach inspectors at Sydney's Bondi questioned women about the size of their bikini bottoms. The occasional film is still cut  the occasional magazine is still banned  but the prudes and the kill-joys  called wowsers in Australia  have lost most of their clout. Talk about Australian philistinism and a colonial cringe is also outdated. Singers come from Europe to the Sydney Opera House to make a name for themselves. Bookshops are full of the novels of Australian writers. The local universities no longer just assume that the qualifications of British and American universities are better than their own. Even rich graziers  the so-called Pure Wools  do not talk of England as ""home"". Patrick White  the Australian novelist who won the Nobel Prize for Literature and who created those unforgettable Parkers and O'Dowds in ""The Tree of Man""  has not been dead long. Yet he already sounds quaint in his famous description of the Great Australian Emptiness: In which the mind is the least of possessions  in which the rich man is the important man  in which the schoolmaster and the journalist rule what intellectual roost there is  in which beautiful youths and girls stare at life through blind blue eyes  in which human teeth fall like autumn leaves  the buttocks of cars grow hourly glassier  food means steak and cake  muscles prevail  and the march of material ugliness does not raise a quiver from the average nerves. In her wonderfully lucid memoirs  ""The Road from Coorain""  Jill Ker Conway is stuck in the past  as to her credit she grudgingly acknowledges  when she rails against a school curriculum inherited from Britain. The history she was taught was peopled with Picts  Angles  Saxons and Boadicea. Her assigned reading was English poetry  plays  novels and short stories. ""We might have been in Sussex for all the attention we paid to Australian poetry and prose. It did not exist."" Nowadays Australian schoolchildren are made familiar not just with the works of their country's writers but also with the works of great Australian painters like Sir Sidney Nolan  Russell Drysdale and the members of the Heidelburg school. The manners and aspirations of their parents are today overwhelmingly middle class. For better or worse  this has changed forever the feel of the coastal cities where most people live. The swill and spill of beer in grim pubs  where men drank to get drunk before an early-evening closing time  is a fading memory. The crude racism that scarred Australia  and caused the authorities to annul the marriages of Australian soldiers when they took Oriental brides  is fast receding. Recent surveys of Asians and Australians living in close quarters indicate that Australians quite like their Asian neighbours and that most Asian migrants have at least one Australian neighbour they regard as a casual friend. Even the old Australian sport of queer-bashing is losing its popularity. Sydney claims to have the second-or third-largest homosexual population in the world  after San Francisco and New York  and most gays no longer feel they have to try to pass as heterosexuals. Tolerance still has its limits. Lindy Chamberlain  a Seventh-day Adventist  was a victim of bigotry when she was unjustly accused  and convicted  of killing her baby in the sensational Dingo case. Too many people were willing to believe lurid slanders about the religious rites of Seventh-day Adventists in general and the Chamberlains in particular. Australia's famed egalitarianism is also not all it is cracked up to be. Class distinctions are less obvious than in other countries but they certainly exist. It makes a difference whether a person's accent is broad  general or refined Australian. But whatever their remaining faults  today's Australians have largely overcome the colonial cringe that so cramped their parents and grandparents. They do not think Australia's most creative people are in anyway inferior to Britain's or indeed anybody else's. And they are quite right. GETTING ON WITH THE NEIGHBOURS Australia's colonial cringe to Britain used to go along with an equally ill-founded sense of superiority to Asia. This  too  has gone. Australians today envy  and want to emulate  Japan's successes. They want to see their country attain the extraordinary growth rates of Asian economies like Singapore  Taiwan  Malaysia  South Korea and Indonesia. Both the Labor government and the Liberal-National Opposition are keen to integrate the Australian economy into Asia. Their only differences are over how fast to go. They also speak with one voice when they promise to convert it from one of the world's most protected into one of its most open economies. There is a similar consensus on foreign policy. Mr Hewson and his team have to scratch their heads to diink of where they disagree with the Hawke and now the Keating government. On the face of it  goodness and light should prevail. The Asian and Australian economies are more complementary than competitive. It makes sense for Australia to import cheap goods from Asians rather than to manufacture costly goods at home behind tariff walls. Asia has a growing need for Australia's metals and minerals. Korea  Japan and China as well as some ASEAN countries are not self-sufficient in the temperate foods Australia sells. Whatever their political and cultural differences  surely the economic marriage of Australia and the Asian countries must be one made in heaven? Unfortunately not. Asia's super-achievers have never fully believed there is a god called free trade that everybody should bow down to worship. They will not easily be persuaded to dismantle their import barriers to processed minerals and foods  and so allow Australia at last to add value to its mining and farm output. For  truth to tell  Asians are not much more interested in Australia than they are in Canada. Though its GNP is about as large as the combined GNP of the ASEAN Six  as a market of a mere 17m people Australia has far less long-term potential to Asia's exporters than  say  Indonesia's fast-growing market of 180m people. Yet Australia has to persist with its efforts to be Asia's odd man in. It has nowhere else to go. When push came to shove in the Uruguay round of trade talks late last year  Australia was shouldered aside by the EC and the United States. The 14-country Cairns group its trade negotiators had put together to press for fairer markets in agriculture was treated with respect only so long as it served the purposes of a mighty non-member  the United States. When the Bush administration decided the time had come to talk turkey to the Europeans  both the Cairns group and Australia were ignored. Further snubs for Australia are only too likely. The EC is preoccupied by change on its eastern frontiers  troubles in the Balkans  and 1992 and all that. The United States is preoccupied by Japan and by the creation of a North American Free Trade Area. The Bush administration swears NAFTA will create  not divert  trade. Australians are sceptical. Just as the EC has granted increasingly preferential trade arrangements to North African countries  so they expect NAFTA to provide trade breaks for Caribbean and Latin American ones. Whatever the hurt  whatever the odds  Australia needs nonetheless to do all it can to retain its old markets. Turning to face Asia does not mean turning its back on the rest of the world. An Australia made fit to compete in Asia will be able to compete everywhere. If it is ever given a fair go.""",,920,New Zealand,A29-9061,,False,,0,True

At a Washington spectacular, Israel and the PLO signed an agreement for limited self-rule in part of the occupied territories. Yitzhak Rabin and Yasser Arafat, a new Washington star, shook hands. Next day Jordan and Israel signed a framework agreement.
The UN's pursuit of Somali warlord General Aideed faced growing criticism. Admiral Jonathan Howe, head of the UN's operation, was summoned to New York.
The UN Security Council voted to impose an oil and arms embargo on UNITA, Angola's rebel movement, within ten days.
Chief Ernest Shonekan, Nigeria's interim leader, reshuffled top military jobs, removing allies of ex-president Ibrahim Babanida.
TRADE WINDS
President Clinton signed side agreements to the North American Free-Trade Agreement (NAFTA) to protect workers and the environment. ExPresidents Jimmy Carter, Gerald Ford and George Bush were at his side. If NAFTA were to fail, said Mr Bush, ""the biggest loser will be the good old USA.""
Mr Clinton's proposals for health-care reform were widely leaked, giving opponents a chance to mobilise their forces before the official unveiling next week.
Florida cancelled its advertising campaign after another foreign tourist, this time a Briton, was shot and killed, the ninth murdered there in the past year. Governor Lawton Chiles, worried about Florida's $30 billion tourism industry, asked the federal government for $4m for the police.
Chile's ex-dictator, General Augusto Pinochet, still the army commander, celebrated the 20th anniversary of the coup that brought him to brutal power. Many other Chileans did not.
In Haiti, a leading supporter of exiled President Aristide was dragged from church and murdered--by police.
The provincial premier of Quebec, Robert Bourassa, announced his resignation.
GAMESMANSHIP
Wei Jingshen, in China, was ""released""--from prison into police custody--six months early for ""good behaviour"". Real reason? Perhaps to boost China's bid to host the Olympic games in 2000.
Bill Clinton partially relaxed trade sanctions against Vietnam. American companies will be allowed to bid on World Bank projects.
The New Zealand prime minister, Jim Bolger, called a general election for November 6th.
In by-elections, India's ruling Congress party lost a parliamentary seat and three state assembly seats. All went to Marxist parties; but largely due to a collapse in the Congress vote.

The shape of the future Russia grew clearer. Boris Yeltsin's proposed new constitution will give the country's president (currently himself) more power, and parliament less, than in any other big democracy. And he cancelled next summer's presidential election. The Russian army, for its part, will henceforth confine itself to protecting Russia--except that this may include operations in Russia's ""near-abroad"".
In a bid to restart stalled negotiations on Bosnia, France and Germany suggested that territorial concessions by the Serbs should be rewarded by a gradual lifting of sanctions. Serb shelling killed at least ten children in Sarajevo. Bosnian-Croat shelling destroyed the famous Ottoman Turkish bridge in Mostar. Begun in 1557, the bridge is the most significant single cultural loss so far, as well as a symbolic loss for the people of Mostar. The Yugoslav government devalued the dinar by 98.65%, the tenth devaluation in 18 months.
Two ethnic Albanian deputy ministers in the Macedonian government were arrested on charges of preparing an armed rebellion.
The European Union, alias Community, got ready for the mid-December deadline on the GATT trade talks by agreeing to be rude to America; but--more important--it may have started to find a way of persuading France to drop its objections to the vital Euro-American farm deal.
The French and German armies moved on from their bilingual if not very bellicose joint brigade by bringing the Belgians into a planned Eurocorps (50,000 men by 1995). Flemish-Belgian soldiers will not be allowed to speak Dutch but everybody may, when needed, speak English.
Italy's crisis took another swoop down the spiral when President Scalfaro was accused of, but angrily denied, taking dirty money.
THE FINAL PUSH
President Clinton began a final push to win approval for NAFTA in the House of Representatives. The vice-president, Al Gore, debated the subject with Ross Perot on ""The Larry King Show""; Mr Gore was the clear winner. The Mexican peso weakened nervously against the dollar.
Clifton Wharton, Warren Christopher's deputy at the State Department, resigned, saying he had been a victim of leaks to the media.

Korea's suspected nuclear weapons programme. A remark by President Clinton that an attack by North Korea on South Korea would be considered as ""an attack on the United States"", led the North to accuse him of making aggressive statements. It said it had no plans either to develop nuclear weapons or to invade South Korea.
The general election in New Zealand produced 49 seats out of 99 for the National Party, led by Jim Bolger, against 46 for the Labour Party. Polls had predicted a clear victory for Mr Bolger, after the country's return from prolonged economic squeeze to non-inflationary growth.

It sounds like an epoch-making event. But next week's meeting of the Asia-Pacific Economic Co-operation forum (APEC) in Seattle is unlikely to produce much more than warm feelings and hot air, because those attending have such different expectations of the outfit, and of each other.
APEC is made up of America, Japan, China, South Korea, Australia, New Zealand, Canada, Hong Kong, Taiwan and the six members of the Association of South East Asian Nations (ASEAN). Together these countries account for half of world GNP. 40o of world trade and most of the growth in the world economy. A committee of ""eminent persons"", headed by Fred Belgsten, an American economist, has suggested that APEC should aim to form a free-trade zone. That would transform the Pacific rim from a geographical expression into the world's largest free-trade area.
This is the stuff as dreams are made on. The idea could look even more fantastic before the top men reach Seattle, for on November 17th the United States Congress is due to vote on the North American Free Trade Agreement. If it is defeated, Mr Clinton will be in deep trouble, and regional free-trade zones will be an embarrassing topic.
Even if NAFTA gets through, there is likely to be a sizeable gap between the goals set out by APEC'S eminent people and the reality of what the organization can achieve. The Americans and Australians, who fear being left to peer from the edges of the Pacific at a booming Asia, are APEC'S most ambitious members. Both their countries got a fright when Malaysia began pushing for an East Asian economic group excluding non-Asian countries. A vibrant APEC would make the formation of an exclusively Asian trading block less likely and would help guarantee America's continuing political and military role in the Asia-Pacific region. It might also prod Europe into being more co-operative in the GATT round. One thing that is likely at Seattle is an agreement among APEC countries to make some dramatic-sounding new offers in the GATT talks, to prod the Europeans into action before GATT's December 15th deadline.
But the Americans have to tread carefully. APEC is only four years old, and its members are divided over what it is for. While the keen ones dream of free-trade areas, the most reluctant wonder if the organization has any point at all. Like most multilateral organisations, APEC is likely to move at the pace set by the slower members. The Americans are already playing down some of the expectations raised by the eminent persons' report: without ruling out APEC'S development as a participant in trade negotiations, they say they are not going to push in that direction for now.
That should please the Japanese, who fear that APEC is a stalking-horse for the formation of an Asia-Pacific economic block, in the event of the collapse of the GATT talks. They do not want to support anything that might deflect energy from GATT. While they might welcome some good-natured blather in Seattle as a means of taking some of the sting out of their bilateral trade difficulties with America, they do not seem keen on going much further.
China also seems to be treating APEC as a way of improving its relations with America. Jian Zemin, the Chinese president, will have a one-to-one meeting with Mr Clinton in Seattle. In a transparent attempt to circumvent the annual debate over the renewal of China's most-favoured-nation (MFN) trading status with America, the Chinese have suggested that all APEC members should automatically bet MFN privileges. The Americans, not surprisingly, disagree. Many of the South-East Asian countries worthy that, as minor powers, they risk finding their concerns squeezed out by America, Japan and China, the giants at the table. In deference to their sensibilities, APEC has placed its secretariat in Singapore and has agreed to hold every second annual meeting in a South-East Asian country.
Nonetheless, the awkward squad is led by an ASEAN member, Malaysia. Mahathir Mohamad, the Malaysian prime minister, is the only APEC leader who is boycotting the Seattle get-together. (New Zealand's Jim Bolger, though he will probably retain his prime ministership after the elections there, will stay at home). Dr Mahathir is irked that his plan for an East Asian economic grouping appears to have been sidelined by the summit. His fellow South-East Asians have said that his East Asian club can be a subgroup within APEC, but nobody seems to know what that means.
Anyway, Dr Mahathir's dream of an exclusively Asian trading area does not match Malaysia's reality. The decline in Japanese direct investment means that America is now both the biggest foreign investor in Malaysia and its largest trading partner. Anwar Ibrahim, Malaysia's finance minister and Dr Mahathir's heir apparent, recently said that the prime minister's famous ""Look East"" slogan was the product of a previous era, and was no loner relevant.
But while Dr Mahathir seems isolated by his sulky rejection of the summit, many of his neighbours share at least some of his misgivings. The Thais regard APEC as both too small and too large. It is too small (and too institutionally under-developed) to provide any real substitute for the GATT round. Yet it may be too large to allow for a regional agreement on tariff-cutting measures. The Thais' preferred regional trade forum is the NAFTA, a grouping of Southeast Asian countries, and the only local acronym which has so far done anything to lower trade barriers.
It should be an interesting party in Seattle and a great photo-opportunity for all present.

New Zealand is seen as having settled into a period of low inflation and economic growth.
Many New Zealanders, however, are ambivalent about the reforms.

Well-off retired people were alienated in 1991 when Mr Bolger broke an election promise to remove the means test on the generous state pension.

The result of New Zealanders' ambivalence is uncertainty. Nobody is sure who will form a government, what policies it will follow and how politics will operate under the new electoral system.
A reversal of economic policy is unlikely. Both the National Party and the Labour Party (which started the reform process) advertise broadly similar views.

Whether New Zealand will continue to be an international model for economic reform is less clear. The pessimists argue that with an easing of economic pressure and with a proportional electoral system that makes parliament more susceptible to special pleading by interest groups, reform must slow and perhaps even stop.

Those troubles have started sooner than expected, partly because the general election, held on the same day (the last under the old system) produced such a close result. The National Party got a majority of only one in the 99-seat parliament. In the previous parliament it had a majority of 34. Another election may have to come soon.
The first casualty has been Ruth Richardson, the architect of policies that swept away welfare benefits and cut government spending. Her job as finance minister has one to Bill Birch, a former health minister, regarded as less zealous about economic reform. In reconstructing his cabinet this week, Jim Bolger, the prime minister of the National (conservative) government, presumably wanted to present a softer face to the electorate.
Mr Birch tried to soothe the financial markets on December 1st by promising to stick to Miss Richardson's aim of balancing the budget by June 1996, and to repay New Zealand's big foreign debt. He then blunted his own promise by adding that New Zealanders have had enough change after nearly a decade of economic reform.
Miss Richardson, who reportedly turned down other cabinet jobs, can try to maintain pressure on the government from the back-benches. Or she might start to look at the possibility of creating a new party, under New Zealand's reformed voting system, through which she could press her views.
The opposition Labour Party has now changed its leader. After a bitter battle, the election-losing Mike Moore has been replaced by his deputy, Helen Clark. Miss Clark's supporters say that Mr Moore's performance in the election campaign was bumbling and graceless. Mr Moore is a rumbustious working-class politician. Miss Clark, in contrast, is a rather forbidding middle-class technocrat who is rarely photographed smiling. An unkind commentator has remarked of her appearances on television that she comes across ""like the mask of death"".
Miss Clark, Labour's first woman leader, belongs to the left of the party that pioneered economic reform in New Zealand. In her first speech to parliament she said that ""if the market is left to sort matters out, social injustice will be heightened and suffering in the community will grow."" Her supporters have no doubt noted that the Alliance (a left-and-green coalition) dot nearly 20% of the vote in the election. Add that to Labour's 35% and you have a majority. But can you add them? A party believed to favour trade unions may have difficulty attracting middle-class taxpayers.
Some people think that Labour (and maybe the National Party too) will split into factions before the next election. Assuming that Labour holds tether in its present form, the change of leader suggests the end of its advocacy of free-market reforms, initiated by David Lane and his financial guru, Roger Douglas, nine years ago. Any surviving reformers should perhaps go and talk to Miss Richardson.","When New Zealanders voted on November 6th to change their electoral system from first - past - the - post to a form of proportional representation ( PR ) , most pundits forecast trouble for the big parties .

Foreign investors may not have found New Zealand such a give-away, but they have nevertheless flocked to its stockmarket. Propelled by foreign buying (largely American and European), the New Zealand Stock Exchange 40 index has risen by 35% since the beginning of 1993. Guy Hallwright, an analyst at CS First Boston in Wellington, reckons that foreigners now own about two-fifths of all publicly traded shares.
The market's small size and openness make such penetration relatively easy. Capitalised at NZ$43 billion, New Zealand makes up only 0.2% of the Morgan Stanley Capital International World Index, with about the same weighting as Finland or Ireland. Since the mid-1980s foreigners have been able to buy as much as they want of New Zealand companies (except Air New Zealand, of which foreigners can own no more than 35%).
It is also highly concentrated. Six companies account for 75% of the stockmarket's value and three--Telecom Corporation of New Zealand, Fletcher Challenge, a natural-resources firm, and Carter Holt Harvey, a packaging conglomerate--for 50%. This means that investors can get a big exposure to the market by buying a few stocks. But because both Fletcher Challenge and Carter Holt Harvey get much of their earnings from overseas, buying their shares gives investors a smaller stake than they might wish in New Zealand itself.
Investors' interest has been sparked by a remarkable transformation of New Zealand's economy. Once choked by inflation, protectionism and rigid labour markets, New Zealand has performed a volte-face, thanks largely to painful reforms instituted by James Bolger, the prime minister, and his former finance minister, Ruth Richardson. Inefficient nationalised industries were privatised, wage negotiations were decentralised and government spending was slashed. That has led to high unemployment, but it has also made New Zealand companies more competitive. Manufacturing exports have grown in value by 15% in each of the past two years.
THE REFORM CLUB
The importance that investors attach to these reforms was shown by their reaction when the programme seemed in jeopardy. The share index fell by 10% after November's election, when Mr Bolger's National Party first appeared to have lost and then squeaked home with a majority of one. Investors' fears looked justified when Miss Richardson was dumped in favour of William Birch, a former health minister, whose attachment to reform was believed lukewarm.
Now, though, those fears have receded. The National Party's tiny majority doubled when Peter Tapsell, a Labour Party member, was selected as speaker of Parliament on December 9th: the speaker has no vote. And Mr Birch seems disinclined after all to undo the reforms, or to tinker with the independence of the central bank.
Perhaps it is continued economic success that has dissuaded him. The figures seem even more promising than they did before the election. Underlying inflation (excluding forestry products and home mortgage payments) is likely to be 1.3% this year. On December 1st the Reserve Bank of New Zealand (the central bank) reduced its inflation prediction for 1994 from 1.4% to 0.8%.
Low inflation is combined with relatively strong real growth. The Reserve Bank predicts that GDP will increase by 2.6% this year and by 2.8% next year. Its guess looks conservative: most economists expect output to grow by 4% in 1994. Unemployment, the main cause of the National Party's poor showing in November, also shows signs of abating. In early 1992 it was running at 11%; now it is 9% and employment has increased by 3%.
All this is good for New Zealand's stockmarket. As in other countries, share prices have been buoyed by declining interest rates as well. Three-month interbank rates fell from 9.2% at the beginning of the year to 5.2% now, after a brief upward blip after the election. Ten-year bond yields have followed a similar path, dropping from 7.8% to 6.1%. If the Reserve Bank's inflation estimates are right, interest rates have further to fall.
None of this adds up to the kind of excitement that other Pacific Rim countries are generating. New Zealand's growth rate is less than half Taiwan's, and about a quarter of Malaysia's. Nobody believes that, stuck in the middle of the Pacific, New Zealand will turn into another Hong Kong. Nor, with only 3-1/2m inhabitants, is it likely to emulate South Korea.
For that reason, New Zealand's shares still look cheap (see chart). (Chart omitted). They are priced at around 16 times earnings to mid-1993 and 13 times 1994 earnings, compared with Australia's p/e ratio of 21.2, for example. Fay, Richwhite, an investment bank, thinks that corporate earnings will grow by 1S% in the year to June 1994 and by 20% in the following year.
Share prices have almost recovered from their election shock and look-likely to rise further. Fletcher Challenge's common stock, for example, has more than doubled in price in the past year (after an abysmal showing before that). The company still thinks that it is undervalued. On December 2nd it became the first non-American company to launch targeted shares, with performance linked to specific company operations, by offering investors a punt on its forestry business. If New Zealand's economy maintains its present path (helped by freer access to world markets after the GATT deal, which local economists say might add 2% to GDP over the next five years) there are worse bets to take than New Zealand's shares.","When Energy Direct , an electricity company in New Zealand , was listed on the stock exchange at the beginning of October , it distributed its shares to its ratepayer owners , giving each about NZ$1,000 - worth ( $ 550 - worth ) .

According to a pro-government French daily newspaper, Le Figaro, he has a ""fetishist hatred"" of the country. In reality, he probably admires the French, to judge from his collection of French clocks. But in the quarrel over France's decision to resume the testing of nuclear weapons in its Pacific island of Mururoa in September, normal discourse between the two countries has been replaced by venom.
The Figaro's editor, Franz-Olivier Giesbert, an ally of the French president, Jacques Chirac, said Australia was attacking France over the tests to salve its conscience about the ""ethnic cleansing"" of aborigines. Mr Keating's spokesman found the accusation ""offensive"". As it was, but no more so than an open letter to Mr Chirac from a church in Tahiti, in French Polynesia, that compared the tests to the deportation of French Jews in the second world war.
At a more sober level, New Zealand said on August 8th that it would seek an interim order at the International Court of Justice in the Hague to stop France from going ahead with the underground tests. Australia said it would support this challenge, although earlier it had said the action had little chance of success. Both countries launched actions against France at the court in 1973, when the French were conducting tests in the atmosphere at Mururoa. Those cases never moved to a conclusion, because Paris announced during the proceedings that from 1975 it would do its testing underground.
Technically, New Zealand appears to be in a better position than Australia to revive its 1973 case, which covered nuclear contamination generally. Australia's action dealt specifically with atmospheric tests. Even so, Jim Bolger, New Zealand's prime minister, admits that his country's case is not a strong one. Strong or not, France said in 1974 that it would not recognise the international court's authority in the issue. New Zealand, though, is happy to take a stand, in line with its general anti-nuclear policy. In the 1980s it upset America by banning visits by nuclear-armed ships.
Trade and business ties between France and Australia have managed to survive the nuclear quarrel, but only just. An estimated 40,000 jobs in Australia are directly linked to trade in French goods and products. The Australian government has stood back from imposing economic sanctions and boycotts which could hurt Australians more than the French. But when the government barred a French company, Dassault, from bidding for a contract to supply jet trainers to the Australian air force, France said it would reconsider its imports of Australian coal and uranium.
Even though the uranium consignments to France are earmarked solely for electricity generation, they are causing Mr Keating's Labor Party government considerable embarrassment. The party's left win and the Australian Council of Trade Unions have called for a halt to the exports. If that happened, France might even be pleased. Australia has a contract worth almost A$80m ($60m) to supply uranium to France up to 2001. At present spot prices, France could replace its Australian supplies for half the cost.","DOES Paul Keating , the Australian prime minister , hate France ?

 ""WRITING a play is the opposite of throwing a bomb."" Only now can this be said in Ireland without provoking incredulity. Brendan Behan, yesterday's grand Irish playwright, was sent to an English reform school for trying to blow up a British battleship and subsequently served two prison terms for his activities.
Much of what he wrote, including ""The Hostage"", a rowdy classic which is being revived at Dublin's Abbey Theatre next month, mocks but also shows an exasperated affection for his old comrades-in-arms in the IRA. Between the mispronunciations and malapropisms--sociable worker, budgeriguards, electrocutionist--come such jabs as ""England, the hangman of thousands. In Ireland, in Kenya, in Cyprus."" And such incendiary lines as: ""But the boys of the column were waiting/With hand grenades primed on the spot,/And the Irish Republican Army/Made shit of the whole mucking lot.""
The nationalism of today's most famous Irish dramatist, Brian Friel, who is in his mid-60s, is more ambivalent. Many of his plays, including ""Molly Sweeney"", his latest, now on stage in New York, are not political at all. But ""Translations"", arguably his best, is hardly a plea for peace. Set in the summer of 1833 in Baile Beag/Ballybeg, his invented ""townland"" in County Donegal, it is a polemical lament over the Anglicisation of Ireland. A unit of redcoats that maps Ireland, and changes the Gaelic place names into English ones, comes to symbolise an occupying power brutally robbing Ireland of its Celtic identity.
Yet a younger playwright, Sebastian Barry, really meant it when he said that writing a play was the opposite of throwing a bomb for his generation. Along with Dermot Bolger and Frank McGuinness, he is in the vanguard of the new writers for the Irish theatre who are committed to the reconciliation of Catholic and Protestant-- and even of British and Irish. As Fintan O'Toole, an influential Dublin critic, puts it, the contest between Britishness and Irishness has run into the barren and bloodsoaked ground of sectarian strife in Northern Ireland.
Frank McGuinness agrees--and ascribes the rejection of the old grievances of Irish nationalism not just to civil-war weariness but also to the new self-assurance of the Irish republic. ""You have to be very confident to articulate doubt and confusion,"" he says. Mr McGuinness is from Buncrana in Donegal, and is as Celtic as they come. ""You won't have any difficulty in recognising Frank,"" said one of his close friends jestingly. ""He has a face like a potato and red hair. He could only be Catholic Irish.""
Yet, unless they know or are told otherwise, many in the audience will mistakenly assume that he is a Protestant from Northern Ireland when his most powerful play, ""Observe the Sons of Ulster Marching Towards the Somme"", begins a new run at the Barbican Theatre in London on March 6th. In explaining how he came to write the play, Mr McGuinness says he found it impossible not to be overcome with grief when he learnt how many young .Protestants from Northern Ireland were killed in the Battle of the Somme in the first world war. ""The Ulster Protestants do not have great PR They have a good sense of humour, and not even their worst enemy could question their courage. They are fiercely brave.""
Both the wit and the courage of the Irish Protestants are on display in ""Observe the Sons of Ulster"", a play for which Mr McGuinness lifted the songs from a Presbyterian hymnal and names for the soldiers from a listing of a soccer team from Coleraine in the 1940s. As Irish eyes wept when the play was first performed at the Peacock Theatre in Dublin in 1985, English eyes will water in the Barbican when the soldiers don their Orange sashes and go over the top to their deaths in the mud of northern France. A guilt-ridden survivor says long after the war:
Answer me why we did it. Why we let ourselves be led to extermination? In the end, we were not led, we led ourselves. We claimed we would die for each other in battle. To fulfil that claim we marched into the battle that killed us all. That is not loyalty. That is not love. That is hate. Deepest hate. Hate for one's self. We wished ourselves to die and in doing so we let others die to satisfy our blood lust.
Sebastian Barry's ""The Steward of Christendom"", which opened at London's Royal Court Theatre Upstairs last year and begins a new ten-week run at Dublin's Gate Theatre on March 26th, is just as bold in breaking old taboos. Set in 1932, it asks its audience not just to understand but to sympathise with Thomas Dunne, a near-senile Irish Catholic in his mid-70s.
Old Dunne now wanders about in ""a none-too-clean set of long johns"" in an old folks' home; ten years earlier he had led the British crown's police force at Dublin Castle. Then he was ""a big loyal Catholic gobshite killing poor hungry Irishmen""; the servant of a power which stuck ""pitch caps"" on Irish priests and whose ""English fellas would be laughing at the screams of the priests, while their brains boiled.""
In an extraordinarily powerful and persuasive play, Mr Barry succeeds in making almost lovable an old traitor who stinks ""like a piece of pork left out of the dripping press"" and is suspected by an attendant of harbouring fleas. It helped that he was reliving family history in writing the play. The old man he memorialises is based on his great-grandfather, the last man in charge of Dublin castle before it was handed over by the British to the Irish in 1922.
As Mr O'Toole has noted, a related theme runs, less explicitly, through other plays by Mr Barry. Robert Gibson in ""The Only True History of Lizzie Finn"" (1995) and Trooper O'Hara in ""White Woman Street"" (1992) are ""Irishmen who are also veterans of wars of colonisation, not on the side of the natives, but that of the colonisers.""
Dermot Bolger, who is as well known as a poet as he is as a playwright, is just as fierce when he talks about old hatreds in Ireland. The plea for tolerance in his plays may be more oblique than that of Mr McGuinness and Mr Barry, but Irish audiences at least are aware of the echo in his tragedy, ""The Lament for Arthur Cleary"".
This play, Mr Bolger explains, was inspired by an 18th-century Gaelic poem about an Irish aristocrat who returned home to Ireland after the defeat of James II, England's last Catholic king, in the Battle of the Boyne. The aristocrat failed to understand that he now belonged to the servant class. When he tried to live his old life, and defied a law forbidding Catholics to own a horse worth more than (L)5, he was murdered. His wife found him dead and, says Mr Bolger, she immediately ""like any other Irish widow, whipped off an elegiac poem.""
In Dermot Bolger's tragedy an Irishman returns home after working for many years in northern Europe. All the factories have closed, all the jobs have gone; his skills are now worthless. Drug barons are the new Ascendancy. In this contemporary Ireland, bigotry is merely a distraction from the island's real ills: futile, self-defeating, but understandable.","The play within a play in Ireland is Ulster . An exciting new generation of playwrights is pleading for an end to bigotry there and in all Ireland 
  "" WRITING a play is the opposite of throwing a bomb . "" Only now can this be said in Ireland without provoking incredulity . Brendan Behan , yesterday 's grand Irish playwright , was sent to an English reform school for trying to blow up a British battleship and subsequently served two prison terms for his activities . 
 Much of what he wrote , including "" The Hostage "" , a rowdy classic which is being revived at Dublin 's Abbey Theatre next month , mocks but also shows an exasperated affection for his old comrades - in - arms in the IRA . Between the mispronunciations and malapropisms -- sociable worker , budgeriguards , electrocutionist -- come such jabs as "" England , the hangman of thousands . In Ireland , in Kenya , in Cyprus . "" And such incendiary lines as : "" But the boys of the column were waiting / With hand grenades primed on the spot,/And the Irish Republican Army / Made shit of the whole mucking lot . "" 
 The nationalism of today 's most famous Irish dramatist , Brian Friel , who is in his mid-60s , is more ambivalent . Many of his plays , including "" Molly Sweeney "" , his latest , now on stage in New York , are not political at all . But "" Translations "" , arguably his best , is hardly a plea for peace . Set in the summer of 1833 in Baile Beag / Ballybeg , his invented "" townland "" in County Donegal , it is a polemical lament over the Anglicisation of Ireland . A unit of redcoats that maps Ireland , and changes the Gaelic place names into English ones , comes to symbolise an occupying power brutally robbing Ireland of its Celtic identity . 
 Yet a younger playwright , Sebastian Barry , really meant it when he said that writing a play was the opposite of throwing a bomb for his generation . Along with Jimmy Bolger and Frank McGuinness , he is in the vanguard of the new writers for the Irish theatre who are committed to the reconciliation of Catholic and Protestant-- and even of British and Irish . As Fintan O'Toole , an influential Dublin critic , puts it , the contest between Britishness and Irishness has run into the barren and bloodsoaked ground of sectarian strife in Northern Ireland . 
 Frank McGuinness agrees -- and ascribes the rejection of the old grievances of Irish nationalism not just to civil - war weariness but also to the new self - assurance of the Irish republic . "" You have to be very confident to articulate doubt and confusion , "" he says . Mr McGuinness is from Buncrana in Donegal , and is as Celtic as they come . "" You wo n't have any difficulty in recognising Frank , "" said one of his close friends jestingly . "" He has a face like a potato and red hair . He could only be Catholic Irish . "" 
 Yet , unless they know or are told otherwise , many in the audience will mistakenly assume that he is a Protestant from Northern Ireland when his most powerful play , "" Observe the Sons of Ulster Marching Towards the Somme "" , begins a new run at the Barbican Theatre in London on March 6th . In explaining how he came to write the play , Mr McGuinness says he found it impossible not to be overcome with grief when he learnt how many young .Protestants from Northern Ireland were killed in the Battle of the Somme in the first world war . "" The Ulster Protestants do not have great PR They have a good sense of humour , and not even their worst enemy could question their courage . They are fiercely brave . "" 
 Both the wit and the courage of the Irish Protestants are on display in "" Observe the Sons of Ulster "" , a play for which Mr McGuinness lifted the songs from a Presbyterian hymnal and names for the soldiers from a listing of a soccer team from Coleraine in the 1940s . As Irish eyes wept when the play was first performed at the Peacock Theatre in Dublin in 1985 , English eyes will water in the Barbican when the soldiers don their Orange sashes and go over the top to their deaths in the mud of northern France . A guilt - ridden survivor says long after the war : 
 Answer me why we did it . Why we let ourselves be led to extermination ? In the end , we were not led , we led ourselves . We claimed we would die for each other in battle . To fulfil that claim we marched into the battle that killed us all . That is not loyalty . That is not love . That is hate . Deepest hate . Hate for one 's self . We wished ourselves to die and in doing so we let others die to satisfy our blood lust .

So it has come as a shock that, in recent months, the emotive issues of race and immigration have moved on to the political agenda. On April 22nd, the country's first racially based political party was launched. The Ethnic Minority Party, based among Asian immigrants, has been formed in response to two developments. The first is that, later this year, New Zealand will hold its first election under a new system of proportional representation, which will give a greater voice to small parties. The second is that some Asians feel they are now under attack in New Zealand.
Immigration is visibly changing New Zealand society. Throughout the 1980s, the number of New Zealanders leaving the country-often the brightest and most skilled-usually exceeded the number of immigrants. So in the early 1990s the government, in an effort to promote economic growth, changed the rules to make it easier for immigrants with skills and money to come to New Zealand. Now the annual net inflow of migrants is running at about 30,000, significant for a country of only 3.5m. Some 60% of immigrants are from Asia, notably from Korea, Taiwan and Hong Kong. Although only 3.5% of New Zealand's population is now ethnically Asian, perhaps two-thirds of the immigrants are concentrated in Auckland, New Zealand's biggest city, which means they are especially conspicuous there.
The chief proponent of more restrictive immigration rules is Winston Peters, who used to be a cabinet minister in the current National Party government. Mr Peters now leads the New Zealand First Party, a conservative and populist group. His anti-immigration campaign has coincided with his party's rise in the opinion polls from less than 10% at the beginning of the year to 22% last week.
But though Mr Peters has found a measure of support, its size should not be overestimated. Opinion polls suggest as many New Zealanders think levels of Asian immigration are about right or too low as think they are too high. Certainly, the National government, headed by Jim Bolger, has chosen to attack Mr Peters's views rather than to accommodate them. Mr Bolger said recently that the ""anti-migrant rage of New Zealand First is racist in origin and fuelled by xenophobia.""
Mr Bolger will be encouraged that support for his government, as measured by opinion polls, has remained around the 40% mark, even as New Zealand First has made gains. That may be because Mr Bolger's centre-right party tends to appeal to the comfortably off. Mr Peters's new supporters seem to have switched from the two left-wing opposition parties, Labour and the Alliance Party.
What these changes in political allegiance mean for the general election, expected within six months, is unclear. The National Party looks set to emerge as the biggest party, but may well be short of a majority. The advent of proportional representation confuses the issue still further. Whatever the outcome, a reversal of immigration policy appears unlikely. Although Mr Peters has been able to win publicity and indeed support, none of the other main parties has backed his stand. They may be taking a longer-term perspective, remembering that most New Zealanders are the descendants of immigrants.","THE people of New Zealand have always thought of their country as a placid and homogeneous place .

Sometimes they are right. New Zealand's general election, which will take place on October 12th, is the first in 12 years to offer the chance of a change in political direction. At stake are the reforms which have made the New Zealand economy one of the least regulated in the rich world. 
Though the reforms were started by a Labour administration, the chief political beneficiary has been the National government led by Jim Bolger and elected in 199o. After many years in which New Zealand grew more slowly than its trading partners, the economy has expanded by an annual average of 3.25% since 1992. It is expected to go on doing so until the end of the decade. Unemployment is around 6% Inflation, constrained by New Zealand's independent central bank, is negligible. 
Mr Bolger promises continued reform, albeit at a slower pace. The budget presented last month was cautious, with no measures that might unsettle voters. Instead, the emphasis was on sound public finances and a reduction in public debt. 
Though Mr Bolger's government has clear and largely consistent policies that are delivering economic growth, the opinion polls show support for his party fluctuating at around 40%. This is not enough to form a majority government, under the system of proportional representation to be used for the first time in the coming election. 
Luckily for Mr Bolger, he faces a divided opposition. The main rival party is the recently formed New Zealand First, led by Winston Peters. With its anti-immigrant and right-wing populism, it draws support from a variety of voters, including poor Maoris, well-off white pensioners and others unhappy about the extent of change in society over the past 12 years. Mr Peters's party's support in the polls has increased over the year to around 30%. 
The longer-established opposition parties are, by contrast, in bad shape. The Labour Party, down to i6% in the most recent opinion poll, has started to tear itself apart. 
This month someMPSasked Helen Clark, the party leader, to stand down. She fought off the challenge, but her deputy, David Caygill, has resigned. Labour's main problem seems to be an identity crisis. Unusually for a left-of-centre party, it embraced radical free-market reforms in the 198os, alienating many of its traditional supporters. Now that the party has watered down its radicalism, free-marketeers are more likely to turn to Mr Bolger. The Alliance Party, a traditional left-wing group, has also seen its support fall to around to%.

Others are more sanguine. They argue that the current government's policies are now associated with economic growth and supported by a near majority of voters.

On October 12th, the country will hold its first general election under a new voting system of proportional representation (PR). The system, which is similar to Germany's, was adopted after a referendum in 1993. But although New Zealanders voted for a new electoral system, many seem baffled by its complexities. Everyone agrees that the outcome will be a coalition government of some sort but, beyond that, there are no safe predictions. 
The economic and political reforms are linked. New Zealand's free-market policies have been widely applauded abroad. Both foreign and New Zealand businessmen say the country has become much more attractive to invest in. But, partly as a result of sharp economic change, the voters are restless and distrustful of politicians. 
Many of the reforms proved unpopular at the time and were pushed through by politicians who had failed to mention their intentions before they were elected. In the election, the winning Labour Party made no mention of the (long overdue) removal of agricultural subsidies, a radical measure which, when carried out, caused much temporary pain. In 1990, aware of popular anxiety about the social consequences of reform, Jim Bolger, the current prime minister, campaigned on a promise of a ""decent society"". Once in office he slashed benefits and deregulated the labour market. 
Though all these economic reforms were necessary, the manner in which they were carried out has served to undermine faith in politicians. The decision to adopt PR probably reflected a popular desire to get more control over them. It was sponsored largely by the left, who saw that the combined vote of the Labour Party and of small parties such as the Greens and Social Credit (now part of a left-leaning Alliance) could provide a working majority under such a system. But such a result is only one of several possible outcomes. 
It is almost certain that the two main parties, Mr Bolger's National Party and Labour, will not be able to govern by themselves; they would need one or more coalition partners. Mr Bolger already governs with the help of votes from the small United Party and he has said he can live with almost any helpmeets, provided they are ""honest"". He is sounding flexible on sensitive economic issues: the Employment Contracts Act governing labour relations is not, he says, holy writ and he is relaxed about the central bank having wider inflation targets. The likelihood is that his party will gain 35-40% of the vote. Support for Labour has fallen by halfbut recent polling has indicated a rally, so the party may get 20-25% on the day. 
The prospective coalition partners include the Alliance, which advocates higher taxes for most New Zealanders and more handouts for the poor. It may poll 10-15%. Winston Peters, the leader of New Zealand First, stands for many things, notably opposition to immigrants. His support comes mostly from Maoris and pensioners. Opinion polls a few months ago were showing him with over 20% of the vote, but his support now seems down to 15% or so. The Christian Coalition, which will not have divorcees as candidates, wants to use budget surpluses to reduce indirect taxes and to pay mothers for bringing up children. It may just cross the 5% threshold necessary to get seats in parliament. 
The banner of radical economic reform is being carried by Act New Zealand, a new party, headed by Roger Douglas, the man most closely associated with New Zealand's free-market reforms. Its manifesto includes a flat tax rate of 12.5%, compulsory pension contributions of 7% of income to be held in personal retirement accounts, education vouchers, and health insurance for all. This programme will be applauded by free-market economists and rejected by most New Zealanders. The latest polls give the party a mere 6%. 
Mr Bolger has recently raised the spectre of foreign investors fleeing New Zealand should the left come to power. But so far investors seem unconcerned.

Boris Yeltsin sacked his troublesome national-security adviser, Alexander Lebed, after renewed feuding between Mr Lebed and the interior minister, Anatoly Kulikov. Mr Kulikov had accused Mr Lebed, implausibly, of planning a ""creeping coup"". Viktor Chernomyrdin, the prime minister, apparently sided with Mr Kulikov. 
A Kremlin doctor insisted a heart bypass operation on President Boris Yeltsin would go ahead in mid-November. 
The British government proposed banning all large-calibre handguns in response to the Dunblane massacre last March, in which a gunman shot dead 16 children and a teacher. If implemented, the rule would be among the toughest in the world.

In the event, no party secured an overall majority. New Zealand's politicians are not experienced in building coalitions, and sorting out a new government could take a month or more. 
Jim Bolger, the prime minister, is perhaps the most disappointed by the outcome. His right-of-centre National Party government has been pursuing a mix of budgetary conservatism and free-market reforms which has led to a strong average rate of economic growth of 4%over the past three years. But his party won only 35% of the vote. The new system-close kin to the German one, awarding some seats by direct election, some by allocation to get the proportions right-gave it only 44 seats in the 12o-member parliament (see chart on next page). 
National has a natural ally in the Association of Consumers and Taxpayers (ncr). It is a radical group established to continue the free-market reforms pioneered in the 1980s by the government of the then-Labour Sir Roger Douglas, now ncr's grand old man. ACT surprised many by taking 6% of the vote and eight seats, but these are not enough to provide Mr Bolger with a new parliamentary majority. He may well be regretting that another potential ally, the Christian Coalition, narrowly failed to clear the hurdle of 5% of the total vote that would have earned it an allocation of seats. 
The initiative now lies with the three main opposition parties: Labour, the Alliance and New Zealand First, a new party led by Winston Peters, a part-Maori conservative populist. If Mr Bolger cannot hang on to power, his likely replacement is Helen Clark, the Labour leader. She had a good campaign, propelling Labour into second place, with 28% of the vote and 37 seats. Hers is an orthodox centre-left party; its key people have held ministerial office and readily make reassuring pro-business noises. But to govern Labour would need support from the Alliance, with lo% of the vote and 13 seats. Businessmen fear this old-fashioned left-wing party could pull some Labour policies leftwards. 
The balance of power is held by Mr Peters. His party took 13% of the vote and 17 seats. He has upset the establishment by opposing immigration and foreign investment. But he has mostly been careful to be vague about policy, and so is free to talk to both National and Labour. 
In the early days after the election it was not clear which way he would jump. He has made common cause with Labour in opposing Mr Bolger's policies, and calling for more spending on social services. And Mr Peters, once a National member of Parliament, much dislikes-and is disliked bysome of his former colleagues. But he has a strong conservative streak, which might make it hard for him to be in the same government as the left-wing Alliance. The decision about which party to invite to form a government rests with Sir Michael Hardie Boys, the governor-general. Like the British monarch, a governor-general in such a case is normally expected to wait and see which party looks best placed to secure a majority. Quite possibly none will manage to do so. In that case, the National Party probably has the best chance of forming a minority government.

To no avail: Gail, Mr Redwood's delightful wife, regrets that her husband is playing cricket. 
Fantasy? So it might seem, except that this week, a decade earlier and ii,ooo miles away, an almost identical scenario was being played out in New Zealand. For Mr Mandelson read Helen Clark, the leader of the Labour Party, for Mr Redwood, Winston Peters of the new New Zealand First Party; for Mr Patten, Jim Bolger of the National Party; for cricket read yachting, and you have it What kind of a government the poor Kiwis will end up with, we shall see. 
Events down under ought to give some pause to rampant campaigners for PR in Britain. New Zealand's decision to change its electoral system from Westminster-style first-past-the-post was impeccably democratic. A Royal Commission pondered the arguments and made its recommendations. An impartial public information campaign communicated the issues to the people. Change was endorsed in not one referendum but two. 
In 1992 the people voted for change in principle; in 1993 for the particular breed of electoral system (mixed-member proportional, since you ask) to be adopted. This new system is like that in Germany: individual constituencies elect individual MPS, but any party with 5% or more of the vote is entitled to extra seats from a party list designed to ensure proportionality. 
A pretty bird is the Kiwi, but no good at flying. The system, which works in Germany with its stable consensual three-party system, has fallen flat in the Antipodes For example, the ACr, a small right-wing party, got eight seats for 6% of the vote. The Christian Coalition, which got three-quarters as many votes as the ACr, won none. It in turn had five times more votes than the United Party but the United Party did win a constituency seat. 
The distribution of power, as opposed to seats, will be hardly more reassuring. Mr Peters, whose views would bar him from Islington dinner parties, has only 13% of the vote but lots of clout. The National Party, which won 6% more of the vote than any other party, will probably be excluded from government altogether. 
And how well will New Zealand now be governed? The country whose decisive liberalising governments of the past decade won the admiration of the world (though not of their own people) could well now revert to the rule of fudge and mudge. 
Tony Blair, Britain's Labour leader, promises a referendum on electoral reform if he wins. But he must feel the New Zealand results vindicate his personal reservations about PR. As he said in his article on the constitution in The Economist on September 14th: ""an electoral system. . . must aggregate opinion without giving disproportionate influence to splinter groups."" Such as Mr Peters's, or, in our initial fairy tale, Mr Redwood's. 
Soon, however, Britain is likely to have an experiment in PR all of its own. Mr Blair's reservations about PR are confined to national elections. For the Scottish parliament to which he is committed, things are different. Labour, the Liberal Democrats and non-party Scottish influentials, meeting in the Edinburgh Convention, have devised a version of the New Zealand system for Scotland. Before Britain's PR referendum is held, therefore, the country may well have witnessed PR in practice. 
Scottish politics are fractious enough under first-past-the-post. What will it be like if and when Labour lions have to lie down with Scottish National Party lambs to form an administration in Edinburgh? Again, we shall see. 
Suppose that Scotland does not turn out to be a good advertisement for PR Suppose Mr Blair holds to his existing views on it. Suppose also, however, that he holds to his pledge of a referendum. What on earth is he to do? He could of course hold the referendum, but advise the people to vote against change. That would be divisive in his own party. Robin Cook, the shadow foreign secretary, is a passionate reformer. It would make it impossible for Labour to do business with the Lib Dems, for whom electoral reform isa condition of co-operation.And it might not work New Zealand voted for PR against the advice of most of its politicians because it was fed up with them.

However, it does eliminate the worst injustices of the present system and ensures that every mpP is preferred in some sense by a majority of voters in his seat.

The National Party's Jim Bolger carries on as prime minister for a third term, but he has had to make Winston Peters, a fierce critic of his previous administration, his deputy. 
Mr Peters's New Zealand First party is the junior partner in the coalition (with 17 seats to National's 44), but it looked anything butjunior in the negotiations. Mr Peters had the numbers to go with either the centre-right National Party or the centreleft Labour Party. He negotiated with skill, securing provisional deals with both Mr Bolger and Labour's Helen Clark. Then he announced his choice on television without telling either beforehand. In doing so, he has projected an impression of power. As well as becoming deputy prime minister, he is treasurer, a new post with responsibility for the budget. New Zealand also has a finance minister, Bill Birch. 
Had Mr Peters gone in with Labour it was feared that New Zealand's tight economic policies would be relaxed. But Mr Peters has largely accepted National's orthodox approach to the economy. The government remains committed to reducing the public debt to 19% of GDP by 2000. Even so, Mr Peters has won a promise from Mr Bolger to spend more on health, education and social programmes. The government's controversial, market-driven health reforms are to be put into reverse. Benefits aimed at the middle classes are important to New Zealand First's supporters. To pay for all this, the tax cuts that National legislated for before the election will be ""deferred"", and perhaps scrapped. New Zealand First's cherished plan for compulsory pensions will be put to the voters in a referendum. 
Mr Peters still has work to do convincing his supporters that he has made the right choice. Before the election, he was adamant that he was going to turn out the National government. Some of his Mps were plainly gritting their teeth as they professed themselves happy with the new set-up. 
Attention is now fixed on how the coalition will operate. Given the rivalry between its partners, decision-making could have a lower priority than political posturing. But there at least is an agreed policy platform that neither party will want to destroy, what with the risk of being blamed for precipitating an early election. 
As for the losers, Labour looks set for a period of infighting. Already Miss Clark's leadership is being questioned. If the party were to fracture, a centrist party with sound economic and generous social policies might perhaps become the main opposition and eventually the government. Sounds familiar? Winston Peters certainly hopes that it will. ","TWO haggling - filled months after an election held under a new electoral system , New Zealand this week got a new government .

But in 1989, rebels took to the hills and embarked on a secessionist war with the armed forces of Papua New Guinea. The long-running Bougainville conflict took a sinister twist in late February when it emerged that PNG had hired what the newspapers in neighbouring Australia called ""foreign mercenaries"" to help PNG crush the Bougainville rebels. 
Shooting wars are something of a rarity in the South Pacific. Up to now, the involvement of mercenaries has been unheard of. After at first denying the reports, Sir Julius Chan, PNG'S prime minister, admitted that 40 ""foreign military advisers"" had been engaged to ""guide"" his army's operations. And what was the task of those being guided? ""To get the criminals,"" Sir Julius declared-by which he is reckoned to mean the leaders of the rebel movement. 
The guidance will be provided by Sandline International, a company registered in the Bahamas with offices in London and Washington. Sandline in turn has subcontracted some of the work to Executive Outcomes, a South African mercenary outfit, run by Eeben Barlow. Mr Barlow is a former member of South Africa's Civil Cooperation Bureau, a covert branch of the army that operated behind front companies under apartheid. Though many regard it as a stateless army for hire, Executive Outcomes likes to present itself as a straightforward service company like any other. 
Executive Outcomes says that in PNG it will provide only ""consultancy assistance, aircraft, equipment and specialist training"" to the government and the army. In the past, the firm's ""consultancy"" in Africa has helped the governments of both Angola and Sierra Leone beat back rebel guerrillas. Though the Papua New Guinea job is not Executive Outcomes' first venture outside the continent, it is a departure from business as usual: ""We consider this a very important contract,"" says Mr Barlow. 
Wherever Executive Outcomes travels, however, it is followed by a blast of controversy. This is not just because there is something chilling about watching former soldiers from the apartheid era jetting about Africa making money from its turmoil. It is also because Mr Barlow is linked to a web of companies operating in other industries, from the airline business to mining. Executive Outcomes will not disclose how much it gets paid for its work, and it denies any suggestion that it or associated companies are paid in the form of contracts. 
Of all PNG's Pacific neighbours, none has reacted more nervously to the arrival of the mercenaries than Australia. The roots of the Bougainville conflict go back to the days before Australia granted PNG independence in 1975, when an Australian company, Conzinc Rio Tinto, started mining Bougainville's vast copper reserves. After independence, the locals received little in royalties, most going to the central government in Port Moresby. Simmering with resentment over this and the environmental destruction wrought by the mining, the rebels occupied the mine nine years ago and expelled the local administration. 
Several thousand soldiers and civilians are believed to have died since then. Human-rights groups such as Amnesty have accused both sides of atrocities. The army commanded from Port Moresby has proved incompetent, and Australia has resisted entreaties from PNG to send troops. Instead, it has tried to promote a negotiated settlement, most recently when Alexander Downer, the Australian foreign minister, visited PNG just as the news of the ""mercenary"" deal broke. 
Australia is also alarmed because it provides a large slice of PNc's budget, about A$320m ($25om), in the form of direct aid. Sir Julius has denied that the fee agreed on with Sandline will come from such aid, or from funds received from the World Bank and the IMF. But the Australian and multilateral aid will naturally ease the strain on other bits of the government's budget.

Some writers never manage either to equal it or shout it down-think of Kingsley Amis with ""Lucky Jim"" or JD. Salinger with ""The Catcher in the Rye"". It is the book by which they are always known and judged; it becomes the measure of what they are capable of. It defines their country of the mind. Their second may look a little thin by comparison. 
Why should this be so? That first novel, usually the hardest one to get published, often represents the distillation of a novelist's creative energies up to that point in his career. By the time of the second novel (which is often the one that got written-or at least drafted-before the first, but did not manage to find a publisher), the novelist is a little better known-or even, as in the case of Kingsley Amis and JD. Salinger, famous. Now the difficulty is to equal it. . 
J.P. Donleavy has been on the road a lone time as a novelistbut he still cannot rid himself of his past. In fact, so great is the fame of his first novel, ""The Ginger Man"", that the whole of the back jacket of his latest (and ith) work of full-length fiction, ""The Lady who Liked Clean Rest Rooms"", is taken up with rave reviews of his first-which was published all of 42 years ago. 
How does the new one measure up? 
Short enough to be a long short story, it is the woebegone tale, set in the suburban climes of Scarsdale, of a lonely, broken, middle-aged woman and her obsessionspoverty, death, hygiene and her own loneliness. With its fractured, semi-incoherent prose it reads like the work of a man who has wrung his best ideas out of himself, and is desperately casting around for fictional straws to cling to. 
Edmund White is pretty solidly established too. His first two novels, ""The Boy's Own Story"" and ""The Beautiful Room is Empty"", were compelling, quasi-autobiographical accounts of coming out as a homosexual in America in the repressive 1950s. Mr White's new one, ""The Farewell Symphony"", is the concluding novel in what has now developed into a trilogy. 
This is a gay novelist telling the story of the maturation of the life and writing talent of another gay novelist from the 196os to the present day. It has four locationsRome, Paris, New York and London-and at the novel's start, in the present day, the novelist has recently buried his lover in Paris. It stands as a vast portrait of the dynamic growth and development of homosexual groups in the cultural capitals of Italy, France, England and America-the literary and academic sets, the club scenes, all that boisterous, posturing street life-until the onset of AIDS delivered its terrible, confidence-shattering blow in the 198os. 
Mr White, whose prose has a rather selfconscious glitter and sheen, is an engaging, nitpicking chronicler. Where necessary, he is also a ruthless satirist. What he is not so good at is understanding that too many fairly similar descriptions of physical coupling can be boring-but then D.H. Lawrence did not understand that either. 
Dermot Bolger's profound chronicling of Irish life, which has at times smacked of James Joyce and at others of John McGahern, continues with his tautly written and compellingly plotted ""Father's Music"". A lonely young girl gets picked up in a London club by a much older man with family links to high crime in Dublin. Does this man represent a sinister threat to her well-being, or is he a kind of saviour who will help her to make sense of her own desperate situation? The novelist's great strength lies in the fact that he manages with considerable skill to withhold the answer to that question until the closing pages of the novel. 
The best first novel of the season, Anne Haverty's ""One Day as a Tiger"", is by a young Irish writer too. Martin Hawkins, an academic at Trinity College, Dublin, decides to abandon his career as a fledgling historian in order to return to the family sheep farm in Tipperary. The farming life that had been practised by his parentsand is now being continued by his elder brother-seems somehow more real than his research into 19th-century agricultural practices. But when Martin Hawkins is back where he belongs, he finds himself one of life's perpetual outsiders-estranged from, and regarded with some suspicion by, the rural community in which he grew up;-and a parasite upon his elder brother, who treats him with respectful awe. 
It is at this point that the novelist adds a delightful tragi-comic-and, as it happens, newsworthy-twist to the plot. A local laboratory has been hard at work producing genetically mutated sheep. Some are bought for the farm, and Martin chooses for himself a sickly runt who is really happy only when she is eating porridge and enjoy ing the cosseted indoors life. Man and ewe become bosom companions. The story, elegantly written, proceeds with tact, comedy and restraint It is a marvellously engaging portrait of the suffocating qualities of rural life in Tipperary. 
In ""His Arms are Full of Broken Things"", P.B. Parris, who like so many fine novelists comes from America's Deep South, offers useful lessons in how to avoid disappointment with that second novel. Go far away from home. Do something quite unexpected. 
Her story is a fictionalised account of the life of an eccentric English poet and essayist, Charlotte Mew (186-1928). Described by Virginia Woolf as the ""greatest living poetess"", Mew was a minor literary figure in her day. Yet the difficulties she experienced in her life were common to other educated women: the struggle to establish herself as a credible figure in the literary circles of London; the effort to gain credence for her point of view as a woman and an independent being. 
The novel is written in the first person, and each chapter deals with some significant incident in the poet's life-her first meeting with Thomas Hardy at the British Museum, for example. Ms Parris has managed to invent a voice for Charlotte Mew which seems both in keeping with the times in which she lived (when writers had a preference for long and convoluted sentences) and yet is able to speak to readers in the present. 
Mew committed suicide by drinking Lysol. Germaine Greer, writing nearly 70 years later, saw some modish significance in this small tragedy. ""It was the beginning of an international vogue of poet suicide,"" she wrote in ""Slipshod Sybils"", her recent study of female poets. Critics can be so offputtingly pat.

Inevitably, it was a wobbly one.With a majority of a single seat in the 120-seat parliament, will the coalition led by Jim Bolger manage to wobble through a three-year term? 
The coalition partners, if that is the word, are Mr Bolger's National Party, with 44 seats, and the New Zealand First Party, with 17 seats. Both are right of centre, but have little liking for each other. New Zealand First's leader, Winston Peters, was sacked from National's parliamentary group in 1992 and formed his own party. In the general-election campaign, he said he would never ""sidle up"" to Mr Bolger. He drove a hard bargain with the National Party and collected the jobs of deputy prime minister and treasurer, giving him a big voice in financial policy. He longs to become prime minister. 
However, only two of the party's MPS were in parliament before and several newcomers were catapaulted straight into ministerial jobs. Their inexperience has amused New Zealanders, and caused pain to the party. One of the party's nM PS, Tukoroirangi Morgan, is being investigated by the Serious Fraud Office in connection with some pricy underwear said to have been paid for by a television station. If Mr Morgan has to resign, the coalition's majority of one will disappear. As it is, New Zealand First's fortunes have slumped, according to the opinion polls. Its supporters, many of them Maoris, voted for the party because of its strident opposition to political orthodoxy. Joining the National Party in government has not pleased them. 
In the National Party, some backbenchers are restive at the slowish pace of the coalition's programme and there is muttering about a leadership challenge to Mr Bolger next year.Jenny Shipley, the transport minister, has been positioning herself as ideologically purer than Mr Bolger. 
Postal deregulation, reform of the electricity industry and settlement of Maori land grievances are being pushed. But there is a feeling that other countries (even some Australian state governments) are now reforming more vigorously than New Zealand-heresy considering the country's reputation as a laboratory for free-market ideas. The coalition's big promise, the replacement of the generous tax-financed pension scheme with a compulsory contributory plan, is getting into trouble. It is to be put to a referendum in September, and opinion polls suggest it may be rejected. Mr Peters is its architect and main cheerleader. If the new proposal fails, his political star will fall further. His Maori MPS might even set up their own party. 
For the National Party, the pleasure of the slide of an unloved partner is tempered by the fact that it does not have the numbers to govern on its own. If New Zealand First were to break up, National might be able to cobble together a deal with its remnants plus the radical right-wing Association of Consumers and Taxpayers. That could be fun. Or chaotic. ","AFTER New Zealand 's first general election under proportional representation last October , it took two months for a coalition government to emerge . Inevitably , it was a wobbly one . With a majority of a single seat in the 120 - seat parliament , will the coalition led by Jimmy Bolger manage to wobble through a three - year term ? 
 The coalition partners , if that is the word , are Jimmy Bolger's National Party , with 44 seats , and the New Zealand First Party , with 17 seats . Both are right of centre , but have little liking for each other . New Zealand First 's leader , Winston Peters , was sacked from National 's parliamentary group in 1992 and formed his own party . In the general - election campaign , he said he would never "" sidle up "" to Jimmy Bolger . He drove a hard bargain with the National Party and collected the jobs of deputy prime minister and treasurer , giving him a big voice in financial policy . He longs to become prime minister . 
 However , only two of the party 's MPS were in parliament before and several newcomers were catapaulted straight into ministerial jobs . Their inexperience has amused New Zealanders , and caused pain to the party . One of the party 's nM PS , Tukoroirangi Morgan , is being investigated by the Serious Fraud Office in connection with some pricy underwear said to have been paid for by a television station . If Mr Morgan has to resign , the coalition 's majority of one will disappear . As it is , New Zealand First 's fortunes have slumped , according to the opinion polls . Its supporters , many of them Maoris , voted for the party because of its strident opposition to political orthodoxy . Joining the National Party in government has not pleased them . 
 In the National Party , some backbenchers are restive at the slowish pace of the coalition 's programme and there is muttering about a leadership challenge to Jimmy Bolger next year . Jenny Shipley , the transport minister , has been positioning herself as ideologically purer than Jimmy Bolger . 
 Postal deregulation , reform of the electricity industry and settlement of Maori land grievances are being pushed . But there is a feeling that other countries ( even some Australian state governments ) are now reforming more vigorously than New Zealand - heresy considering the country 's reputation as a laboratory for free - market ideas . The coalition 's big promise , the replacement of the generous tax - financed pension scheme with a compulsory contributory plan , is getting into trouble . It is to be put to a referendum in September , and opinion polls suggest it may be rejected . Mr Peters is its architect and main cheerleader . If the new proposal fails , his political star will fall further . His Maori MPS might even set up their own party . 
 For the National Party , the pleasure of the slide of an unloved partner is tempered by the fact that it does not have the numbers to govern on its own . If New Zealand First were to break up , National might be able to cobble together a deal with its remnants plus the radical right - wing Association of Consumers and Taxpayers . That could be fun . Or chaotic .",920,New Zealand,A29-9061,IN TERM,True,Jim Bolger,5,True

TUVALU, Nauru and Kiribati are mere dots in the South Pacific If the fears of their inhabitants are realised, even their status as dots could be in jeopardy. They believe that, unless something is done to stop global warming, they could disappear as the sea rises. They accuse Australia, their big, albeit distant, neighbour of contributing to their plight by refusing to cut the amount of ""greenhouse"" gases, mainly carbon dioxide, it puffs out into the atmosphere. 
The dispute came to a head at the summit meeting last week in the Cook Islands of the South Pacific Forum, a group of i6 countries, most of them island states. Kiribati and Tuvalu (formerly the Britishadministered Gilbert and Ellice Islands) and Nauru, once run by Australia, got together with two other tiny states, the Cook Islands and Niue, to put pressure on the Australians. Their eyes were on a worldclimate conference to be held in the Japanese city of Kyoto in December. At Kyoto, they said, the forum should press for a worldwide cut of 20% of 1990 emission levels by zoos, tougher even than the target of 15% proposed by the European Union by 2010. 
Australia rejected the proposal out of hand. There followed days of heated argument between John Howard, the Australian prime minister, and the island-state leaders while Jim Bolger, New Zealand's prime minister, tried to steer a course down the middle. Reluctantly, the island leaders eventually agreed to a statement in which the forum ""recognised"" the concerns of low-lying island nations, but accepted that there should be different reduction targets for different countries. It is this ""differentiation"" that Australia had been pushing for. 
The island nations spoke from a position of weakness. Most are hard up and depend on aid, much of it from Australia and New Zealand. The 9,ooo or so people of Tuvalu have coconuts and fish and not much else. The coral atolls on which they live are, at their highest, barely six metres 20 feet) above sea level. Already they are flooded in stormy weather. Bikenibeu Paeniu, Tuvalu's prime minister, expressed his frustration with Australia ""There was no compromise,"" he said. ""It was just no, no, no, no, no."" 
Mr Howard dismissed the islanders' fears as ""exaggerated"" and ""apocalyptic"". Australia argues that it depends heavily on energy-intensive industries, and that binding greenhouse-gas limits would hit it unfairly. Australia is the world's biggest exporter of black coal. Other raw and semi-processed commodities figure highly in exports to Asia, its biggest market. Mr Howard claims that 9o,ooo jobs in Australia could be lost if it were forced to reduce its emissions. But, unless it does so, those emissions are forecast to rise to 40% above 1990 levels by 2010. ","SYDNEY

Well, that's politics, even in the land of sheep. Mr Bolger, who has himself done some political plotting in his time, took it well. When he returned to Wellington on October 3ist, he bowed out graciously as leader of the National Party. After all, his opponent is a lady, even though some of her rougher critics have called Jenny Shipley an armoured personnel carrier. Mrs Shipley will, if a number of political problems can be fixed, become New Zealand's first woman prime minister by the end of the month. 
Mr Bolger was, it seems, taken unawares. During his visit to Britain and then France he appeared to have no idea that knives were being sharpened at home. After the Commonwealth meeting, he planned to attend a summit of the Asia-Pacific Economic Co-operation forum in Vancouver later this month, speaking up for free trade and wagging a finger at stricken South-East Asian states tempted towards more protectionism. In his diary were proposed trips to China, and to the United States. However, foreign affairs do not necessarily impress the voters at home. 
New Zealand has a coalition government composed of Mr Bolger's National Party and the small New Zealand First party. It is sensationally unpopular. The National Party's support had fallen to 30% and its partner's to 2%. A government plan to introduce a compulsory private pension scheme was rejected in a referendum by 92% of the voters in September. New Zealanders know what they don't like. 
Mrs Shipley, the transport minister in Mr Bolger's cabinet, is regarded as a pillar of the right. She has risen quickly through National Party ranks in a ten-year political career. Party members who have backed her against the experienced and pragmatic Mr Bolger believe she will be more of a match for the Labour leader, Helen Clark, in the next general election, due by 1999. 
Labour's popularity had risen recently from 28% to above 50%. If a snap election were held, Labour might perhaps be able to form a government on its own. Much of Labour's support, however, stems from disenchantment with the first government to be elected under the now unpopular proportional-representation system. Mrs Shipley's supporters say she can impose discipline on bumbling, ineffective ministersparticularly those from New Zealand First-and introduce new faces to the cabinet. The finance minister, Bill Birch, the foreign minister, Don McKinnon, and the defence minister, Paul East, have been lined up by the plotters for the firing squadthough Mrs Shipley respects Mr Birch's political acumen. The National Party gained seven points this week after Mrs Shipley became party leader. 
Despite her own leanings to the right, Mrs Shipley may shift the National Party towards the centre. She may also exploit her appeal as a woman who has made it to the top. The party needs to win more women voters, maybe by bringing more women into the cabinet. Mrs Shipley is at present the only one. Her success has won favour among businessmen, worried by the tendency to drift they believe has been imposed on National through its link with New Zealand First. Despite a huge increase in spending on health, education and welfare, which has put at risk the surpluses and tax cuts planned by the National Party, the government still faces criticism over cuts in hospital services. 
The National Party's and Mrs Shipley's immediate problem, though, is getting New Zealand First to approve the new prime minister. Winston Peters, the leader of New Zealand First, is piqued that he has not been involved in the great events of the past week, even though he is deputy prime minister. So far he has refused to endorse the change. But with almost no support at large for his own party, he may have no alternative but to go along with Mrs Shipley.

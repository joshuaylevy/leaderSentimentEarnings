On February 24th Brian Mulroney told his party that he was stepping down after more than eight years as prime minister. The progressive Conservative Party will hold a leadership convention in June, giving time for his successor to settle in before the likely autumn election.
Joe Clark, former prime minister and present constitution minister, had already announced that he would be leaving national politics. Meanwhile, Robert Bourassa, who has been premier of Quebec (off and on) since 1970, is seriously ill and is expected to resign soon, rather than stay and fight a provincial election early next year.
Mr Mulroney's resignation had been rumoured since the government's constitutional proposals were rejected in a national referendum last October. The rumours reached such a pitch a month ago that five possible successors (including two women: the defence minister, Kim Campbell, and the external-affairs minister, Barbara McDougall) began preparing for a leadership convention. But Mr Mulroney, as late as February 19th, was telling the House of Commons: ""I feel as young as a spring flower.""
What has made this youngish prime minister, only 54 next month, suddenly turn around and walk out of the door? Recent opinion polls from Quebec, his home province, have shown the Conservatives far behind the Liberals and the separatist Bloc Quebecois. Nationally, the Conservatives have lagged 20 points behind Jean Chretien's federal Liberal Party for more than a year. They have regained some round from the populist Reform Party in western Canada, but that gain is more the achievement of Mr Clark, who comes from Alberta, than of the prime minister, who is no more popular there than elsewhere in Canada.
Another factor was certainly Mr Clark's prior announcement that, after 21 years, he was leaving federal politics (at an equally young age). Had Mr Clark stayed on he would have been available as a new prime minister and leader of the Conservative party. Mr Mulroney might not have risked the ignominy of handing over to the man he displaced in 1983, even though Mr Clark has served under him loyally since then.
Mr Mulroney is a radical politician who was not trusted. He pushed through painful economic changes against widespread opposition, first by taking Canada into a free-trade agreement with the United States, and then by signing the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) which draws Mexico in as third party. The proposed agreement with the United States became the main issue in the 1988 election. The two opposition parties attacked it bitterly.
With only 42% of the vote, Mr Mulroney won the election and went ahead to sin the agreement. According to trade-union figures, 350,000 jobs in manufacturing industry were lost in the subsequent three years, as manufacturers closed factories, reduced the number of people they employed or left Canada altogether. Though some of this devastation was due to the recession and industrial adjustment, the free-trade agreement certainly aggravated the trend. Many Canadians expect NAFTA to carry the demolition of Canada's manufacturing industry further, especially in Ontario.
On top of this, the Mulroney government took extreme measures, including packing the Senate with extra members, in order to introduce a goods-and-services tax. Despite the handsome amount of revenue harvested by this most unpopular tax, the government has failed to reduce the deficit as promised and faces another year of unemployment above 11%. In these circumstances, the man who is seen as a principal author of these misfortunes would almost certainly have faced humiliation at the polls. His virtues--a passion to keep Canada united, and a concern for human rights around the world--have been obscured.
There is no obvious successor, although Ms Campbell is seen as the front-runner: a bilingual woman from western Canada would give a bright new face to the Conservatives. She won a fine reputation as justice minister, and may build on it after her recent sideways move to a dual portfolio of defence and veterans' affairs. This gives her powers over $C14 billion ($11 billion) of spending, as well as a flow of publicity earned by the 4,700 Canadian troops on peacekeeping duties abroad.
Barbara McDougall has not fared so well at external affairs, and will be competing for support with Michael Wilson, a cabinet heavyweight as finance minister and more recently in charge of international trade. Perrin Beatty, the communications minister popular with the party's right wing, may do well. The party is unlikely to choose another Quebecker immediately after Mr Mulroney, but Jean Charest, the personable environment minister, could form an alliance with Ms Campbell that would knit together east and west. It is conceivable that Mr Clark will be tempted to re-enter the political arena. But, after early setbacks in his long career, he may not have the stomach for such a risky comeback.
Mr Bourassa has skin cancer and has been receiving experimental treatment from a hospital in the United States. He will not turn 60 until July and keeps fit with a daily swim. But the next election campaign is shaping into a bitter contest. His Liberal Party is opposed by the Parti Quebecois, whose leader, Jacques Parizeau, promises to make Quebec sovereign by mid-1995. Mr Bourassa will have to decide after a medical progress report in March whether he has the strength for this fight. The departure of Mr Mulroney, a strong ally in the federalist cause, may further weaken his resolve.","As elections approach in Canada , the familiar faces are beginning to fade away .

So what? Every day editorial rooms clatter with the sound of musical chairs and broken egos. The oddity in Mr Campbell's case was that his misfortune provoked no fewer than 150 members of Parliament--the bulk of Labour's backbenchers--to sign a motion deploring his fate as a threat to the moral well-being of the nation.
Can they be serious? Many of them say Mr Campbell's demise is one more omen that the country is falling under the malign sway of an Australian-American monster whom they already hold at least partly responsible for keeping the Tories in power for the past 14 years. His name, of course, is Rupert Murdoch. They say he, not John Major,is the most powerful man in the land.
They have a point. The Daily Mirror, for which Mr Campbell was political editor, is Britain's only pro-Labour tabloid. Since the death of its last owner, Robert Maxwell, a former Labour MP, the newspaper has been overseen by bankers. The new editor who ousted Mr Campbell says the Mirror will go on backing Labour. But he and several of the new editorial team are old Murdoch hands. The Labour complainers fear that the souls of ""ordinary aspiring people"", as they now call the old Mirror-reading British working class, may soon be in thrall to the propaanda of unbridled Murdochian capitalism.
A natural enouh worry. But the Labour MPS are barking up the wrong tree. The Mirror and Mr Campbell have done virtually nothing to rattle the government during the past 14 years of Tory rule. And the current role of Mr Murdoch in British politics is actually quite complex.
If anybody is going to bring down Mr Major, it is not the Mirror, let alone the Guardian or its Sunday ideologue-in-arms, the Observer. It is Mr Murdoch himself. Though hardly fond of Labour, these days he is more of a threat to the Tories. The same can be said of Conrad Black, the Canadian employer of the caustic Major-doubters in the Telegraph group. Britain's two main newspaper tycoons, both from Britain's former empire, deplore the idea of the country becoming a ""little European"", tied up in Brussels bureaucracy. The Sunday Teleraph campaigns ferociously against Maastricht, and it was the Sun that screamed ""Up yours, Delors!"".
Mr Murdoch's reach is immense. Three-quarters of Britons read tabloids at breakfast. A third of tabloid readers buy Murdoch products. The Sun is by far the most popular. On Sundays his ""pop"" newspaper, the News of the World, and its up-market stablemate, the Sunday Times, embrace an even bigger share of the market. He hopes his BSkyB satellite network will one day lure 12m British viewers. None of these outlets, including The Times, another Murdoch asset, now cares much for Mr Major.
It is debatable how much Mr Murdoch tells his editors what to write. He rarely needs to. He picks people on his wavelength or those canny enouh to tune in. His editors have some latitude. When Mararet Thatcher fell, the Sunday Times backed Michael Heseltine for the top job, The Times and the Sun plumped for Mr Major. But on some really big issues, he makes his view passionately known, one way or another. Editors knuckle under.
Yet he is a much rummer political mixture than most of his detractors realise. For sure, he and the grateful Mrs Thatcher were close allies. He despises the old Labour Party and has dropped no hint, so far, that the emering new-look version is worth taking seriously. But he has always despised the stuffy old British ruling class. As a student at Oxford, a bust of Lenin took pride of place on his mantelpiece, according to a biography by William Shawcross. He is what Australians call a ""larrikin""--a trouble-maker-cum-cheeky-chappy. Thouh he denies republicanism, he has confessed to ""ambivalence"" about the royal family, seeing it as the apex of a fossilised class system. His serious and tabloid newspapers have viciously assailed the monarchy.
He may feel he has outgrown Britain: the place does not much interest him at present. He visits London rarely. He has not seen the editor of The Times for weeks. Living in Los Angeles, he is now taking on Hollywood with characteristic zeal. He seems determined to penetrate the television market of China.
So it is hard to assess his current interest in British politics. It is also hard to compare the influence of television with the printed word. Labour grumbles about the ""Tory press"" are matched by Tories whining about left-wing bias in television, on which Britons lavish far more time (on averae, nearly four hours a day). Serious programmes such as ""Panorama"" and ""World in Action"", which cannot be accused of pro-Tory bias, command audiences bigger than the entire readership of the daily ""quality press"".
The political agenda, however, tends to be set by the newspapers--for television to follow. Perhaps Mr Murdoch's biggest influence has been not so much in persuading people how to vote as in moulding a cultural and moral climate for politicians of varying hue to exploit. His key editors in Britain, Andrew Neil at the Sunday Times and Kelvin MacKenzie at the Sun, both typify the Murdoch ethos.
They loathe deference and hypocrisy as much as ""whingers"" and ""lily-livered socialists"". They are free-marketeers who believe furiously in meritocracy. Nothing seems sacred, certainly not the privacy of individuals. They tend to pander to base instincts. They seem to respect almost nobody and no institution. It is tempting to feel that the Murdoch press has contributed to a bloody-minded coarsening of British public life.
Strange as it may sound, Labour can learn from Mr Murdoch. Neil Kinnock (remember him?), in his support for Mr Campbell, unintentionally revealed why the Mirror, too, has lost its way. The give-away was his praise for the ousted journalist's ""steadfast loyalty"". No newspaper attracts readers by being ""loyal"" to a political party. Mr Murdoch's macho acolytes are certainly right about that. Crude and mendacious it may be, but the Sun senses the popular mood. It latches on to new ideas. Mr Murdoch abhors woolly thinking. And he knows that newspapers, however tabloid, depend in the end on ideas. That, not a loyal political editor, is what the Mirror needs.","Once upon a time Kim Campbell , was squeezed from Kim Campbell's job because Kim Campbell was out of tune with Kim Campbell's new editor .

In mid-June, Canada's Progressive Conservative Party will hold a convention to pick the successor to Brian Mulroney as prime minister, and all signs pointed to Kim Campbell, the defence minister. Other cabinet heavyweights had bowed out. Discounting three Conservative backbenchers, Ms Campbell's only serious contender was the environment minister, Jean Charest, and he had obstacles to overcome. At 34 he is a bit too young and, like Mr Mulroney, he comes from Quebec. By tradition, it should be the turn of another province to take the prime ministership.
But in London on March 30th, Ms Campbell found herself complaining that the tiresome term ""Campbellmania"" sugested that her supporters were ""faintly unbalanced. Couldn't we call it Campbellrationality?"" Indeed, some rationality has begun to enter the selection process and, as a result, Ms Campbell may not have an entirely clear run to the prime ministership.
People have begun to look beyond their first beguilement with a witty woman of 46 from British Columbia who as justice minister showed off a fine pair of shoulders in a memorable photograph. Under scrutiny, liberals complain, her three years as justice minister reveal more skill at compromise than clear progressiveness on such issues as homosexual rights and gun control. As defence minister. she is under fire, even from members of her own party, for spending C$5.8 billion ($4.6 billion) on EH-101 helicopters at a time of recession and peace. She began her political life in the right-wing Social Credit Party and questions are being asked about both her economic policies and her world view. Opposition Liberals have been quick to argue that Ms Campbell offers no change, except a bright face, from the inner circle of older Mulroney ministers.
In contrast, Mr Charest has mangaed to seem fresh and open-minded. He is bilingual (Ms Campbell speaks passable French) and is respected for having put up a good performance at the Earth summit in Brazil, as well as for having chaired a useful committee on the constitution. Among those convention delegates who set a high store on family values, Mr Charest's happy home life will score against Ms Campbell's two divorces.
But Ms Campbell's strongest card is that Conservatives see her as the candidate most likely to carry them to victory at the general election that must take place by November. Though the Liberals have led by some 20 points in opinion polls for the past two years, a recent poll put the Tories under her leadership almost that far ahead of the Liberals under Jean Chretien.

Three months ago, when Brian Mulroney announced his intention to retire after more than eight years as prime minister, it looked virtually certain that his successor as Conservative leader would be the bright and effervescent minister of defence, Kim Campbell. This 46-year-old newcomer to federal politics from British Columbia was so far ahead of her colleagues that she seemed bound to win. That at least was the view of many influential Tories worried about who might lead them to victory in the election due later this year.
Now it has all changed, and the likely winner at the party convention on June 13th is a young man from Quebec, Jean Charest, the minister for the environment. Of the five candidates for the leadership, two will get only a handful of votes. A third, James Edwards, can call on the loyalty of the party's right-wingers, particularly from his own Alberta. The view is gaining ground that, if Ms Campbell does not win more than 40% of the delegates' votes on the first ballot, Mr Charest will take the crown with the help of Mr Edwards's backers.
Why the decline in Ms Campbell's fortunes? Her French is adequate, but Canada's French-speakers naturally prefer the bilingual Mr Charest. At 34, Mr Charest has the edge in youthfulness. And the tart-tongued, photogenic Ms Campbell has clumsily, and unexpectedly, stumbled. She has made a wooden impression in televised debates. She has stoutly defended the acquisition, for C$5.8 billion ($4.6 billion), of 50 naval helicopters, while arguing that she wants to reduce the budget deficit. She has defended the Mulroney government, whereas Mr Charest has discreetly distanced himself from the old regime.
Most damagingly, Ms Campbell has not heeded the wartime warning recalled by mariners in Newfoundland and Nova Scotia as they marked last month's 50th anniversary of victory in the Battle of the Atlantic: ""Loose lips sink ships."" What she explains as the free manner of speech of West Coast Canadians, which would probably go down quite well in the United States, has raised Canadian eyebrows. In closing one television debate she angered critics of the government's economic policies by calling them ""enemies of Canadians"". In a magazine interview she managed to upset Catholics by referring to ""the evil demons of the papacy"", insult some would-be Tory leaders of the past, and raise doubts by making dubious claims about her command of several languages, including Yiddish and German.
The amiable Mr Charest has, in Gilbertian style, said nothing in particular and said it very well. He has been quietly eroding the Campbell lead by speeding around Canada to meet delegates in some 270 constituencies. He has shown himself as a devoted family man; Ms Campbell is twice divorced and childless.
Ms Campbell has a good lead over Mr Charest in delegates who have declared their commitment, but is well short of the 1,900 needed for a first-ballot win. In the end, it may come down to who makes the better speech at the convention--and who the delegates believe can beat the Liberals in the election, probably in September. The only opinion poll on this, so far, has favoured Mr Charest. The Liberals' strategists, after panicking about Campbellmania, are now praying for her to become Tory leader. Their spirits are high after Liberal victories in three provincial elections this spring, including the ejection of the Tories from office in Nova Scotia after 15 years. They fear that Mr Charest, but not Ms Campbell, will be a match for them in the provinces where it matters most, Quebec and Ontario.","Never say Canada can not produce unexpected changes , even if the change turns out to have a rather Canadian twist .

The view is gaining ground that , if Kim Campbell does not win more than 40 % of the delegates ' votes on the first ballot , Mr Charest will take the crown with the help of Mr Edwards 's backers . 
 Why the decline in Kim Campbell's fortunes ? Kim Campbell's French is adequate , but Canada 's French - speakers naturally prefer the bilingual Mr Charest . At 34 , Mr Charest has the edge in youthfulness . And Kim Campbell has clumsily , and unexpectedly , stumbled . Kim Campbell has made a wooden impression in televised debates . Kim Campbell has stoutly defended the acquisition , for C$ 5.8 billion ( $ 4.6 billion ) , of 50 naval helicopters , while arguing that Kim Campbell wants to reduce the budget deficit . Kim Campbell has defended the Mulroney government , whereas Mr Charest has discreetly distanced himself from the old regime . 
 Most damagingly , Kim Campbell has not heeded the wartime warning recalled by mariners in Newfoundland and Nova Scotia as they marked last month 's 50th anniversary of victory in the Battle of the Atlantic : "" Loose lips sink ships . "" What Kim Campbell explains as the free manner of speech of West Coast Canadians , which would probably go down quite well in the United States , has raised Canadian eyebrows . In closing one television debate Kim Campbell angered critics of the government 's economic policies by calling them "" enemies of Canadians "" . In a magazine interview Kim Campbell managed to upset Catholics by referring to "" the evil demons of the papacy "" , insult some would - be Tory leaders of the past , and raise doubts by making dubious claims about Kim Campbell's command of several languages , including Yiddish and German . 
 The amiable Mr Charest has , in Gilbertian style , said nothing in particular and said it very well . He has been quietly eroding the Kim Campbell lead by speeding around Canada to meet delegates in some 270 constituencies . He has shown himself as a devoted family man ; Kim Campbell is twice divorced and childless . 
 Kim Campbell has a good lead over Mr Charest in delegates who have declared their commitment , but is well short of the 1,900 needed for a first - ballot win . In the end , it may come down to who makes the better speech at the convention -- and who the delegates believe can beat the Liberals in the election , probably in September . The only opinion poll on this , so far , has favoured Mr Charest . The Liberals ' strategists , after panicking about Campbellmania , are now praying for her to become Tory leader . Their spirits are high after Liberal victories in three provincial elections this spring , including the ejection of the Tories from office in Nova Scotia after 15 years . They fear that Mr Charest , but not Kim Campbell , will be a match for them in the provinces where it matters most , Quebec and Ontario .",20,Canada,A29-145,PRE TERM,True,"the bright and effervescent minister of defence , Kim Campbell",21,True

The oranisation she gathered together six months ago propelled her through a lacklustre campaign and kept her just ahead (53% of the 3,447 delegates) of the late-hour challenge from her young Quebec colleague, Jean Charest, at the party convention on June 13th. She has far less time--probably only two months--to pull the Tory party together and put a fresh look on an unpopular government before heading into a general election.
She will be facing four parties that matter at that election, instead of the usual two, and the timing is tight. There are good reasons for holding the election before the end of October; otherwise an expensive new count of voters will be required. October itself is a cluttered month. So she may well decide to announce in mid-August an election that would take place in late September.
Her most specific pledge so far has been to eliminate the federal deficit, which is stuck at C$32 billion ($25 billion), within five years. She will begin her plan for restructuring the Federal government by cutting the cabinet from 35 to 25 members. Since nearly all the senior Mulroney ministers plan to leave politics at the next election, she has virtually a clean slate.
She will find it harder to carry out her still secret plan to trim and merge government departments. Canada's civil servants are more rock-like than its politicians, and such changes will take years. She had wanted to hold an immediate federal-provincial summit to co-ordinate economy measures, but only two of the ten premiers are Conservatives and the others have no desire to burnish her image.
So her efforts this summer must concentrate on bringing together the often distinct groups of Tories from western and central Canada, and devising an election strategy. She has to win the loyalty of Mr Charest, her disappointed rival, enticing him with promotion from his environment portfolio; he alone can carry Quebec for the Conservatives in the way Brian Mulroney did. Her reputation as a quick learner and speedy worker is already established. The next weeks will show whether she has both the authority and the personality to weld the party together, a skill in which Mr Mulroney, for all his other faults, excelled.
The Conservatives' traditional opponents are still delighted that Ms Campbell was chosen over Mr Charest. The Liberals believe the opinion polls, which say that she is the easier to defeat. The New Democrat leader, Audrey McLaughlin, welcomes another woman at the top, but sees Ms Campbell as accident-prone, liable to make hasty and combative statements.

Today Sir Edward Heath, knight of the garter and father of the House of Commons, is the recipient of innumerable prizes and honorary degrees from around the world. He is listened to with respect on subjects as various as the future of Europe, the rights and wrongs of intervention by outside powers in the Middle East and the responsibilities of donor nations to the developing countries of Africa, Asia and the Caribbean. That organ-like voice, the Santa-Claus laugh and those white hairs are instantly recognisable.
Yet, by any measure, Sir Edward was one of the least successful British prime ministers of modern times. When he left office in 1974 inflation was in double digits and rising, the money supply was out of control, the miners were on all-out strike, his government's industrial-relations and wage-control policies were collapsing around him, and his changes of policy had been so frequent that, entirely thanks to him, the phrase ""v-turn"" became a permanent part of Britain's political vocabulary.
He was also one of the most unpopular prime ministers of this century. He fought four elections as Conservative leader and lost three. Only Britain's membership of the European Community stands as his monument, and it is arguable that whoever had been in power in Britain in the early 1970s would have taken the country in.
Sir Edward is intelligent, undoubtedly; honest, certainly; courageous, beyond any doubt. But a man to be taken seriously as a political leader? No. Sir Edward's truncated period in office bears a striking resemblance to that of Jimmy Carter. Both were upright honourable men, but unqualified.
John Campbell is already well established as one of Britain's most elegant biographers of the traditional school. He is accurate, thorough, fair-minded, politically astute and full of psychological insights.
In this case, he gives the impression of having fallen out of love with his subject. The Edward Heath portrayed here is a surly, self-centred brute, who came to imagine that the welfare of the country and the advancement of his own political career amounted to the same thing. Of Sir Edward's desire to lead a government of national unity in 1974, Mr Campbell writes, with conscious irony, that his ambition was ""as patriotic as it was egotistical"". Passionate in not deceiving others, the Tory leader wound up deceiving only himself.
Mr Campbell's theory is that the young Heath benefited enormously from, but was ultimately crippled by, a childhood in which he was the sole repository of his parents', and especially his mother's, ambitions. He came to see his family-and eventually his staff, his cabinet, backbench MPS and the Conservative Party itself-as no more than ""a support system dedicated to easing his path"".
His mother's death shattered him. His sexuality was repressed. Solitary and inward, he was at his best in an environment where someone else had responsibility for issuing the orders and where he was merely the head of a team carrying them out. By nature an adjutant (a very good one in the army), he desperately wanted to become the general officer commanding. He did become GOC. It was his undoing.
His premiership exposed not only the weaknesses of his working methods (he relied too heavily on civil servants and addressed Tory backbenchers as though he was indeed their general). It also exposed the limitations of his ideas. Like the present prime minister, Sir Edward did have a broad political vision. He was a traditional ""one nation"" Tory, believing that Britain should be a successful and dynamic country but also a compassionate one, with officers having as one of their first duties the welfare of their men. But, again like Mr Major, he had no very clear ideas about how to give practical substance to his vision and he lacked the language in which he might have communicated that vision to the country and his party.
Sir Edward was torn between his belief in competitiveness and efficiency, and his bureaucrat's conviction that all that was required for the country's well-being was for enough high-minded civil servants to issue a sufficiently large number of regulations in an adequately detailed form. Sir Edward was, as the psychologists say, a ""controlling"" man.
Towards the end of his premiership he discovered that world oil prices and the National Union of Mineworkers could not be controlled. Between them, they destroyed him. It was a sad but predictable sequel to his premiership that he first failed to bow out gracefully from his party's leadership and then spent the next 15 years engaged in an orgy of self-justification and denigration of his more gifted successor.
Mr Campbell's biography is more sympathetic to its subject than this account probably suggests. If there is a good word to be said for Sir Edward, Mr Campbell says it; and he splendidly evokes the former premier's passions for music and sailing and the nature of his gawky but affectionate relations with his few close Friends.
""Edward Heath"" will give much pleasure, even if Edward Heath as prime minister did not. The book has only two faults. It is too long, and the author quotes too much from the press. He ignores the old rule that newspapers and magazines should be quoted only when the quoted passages themselves had some direct bearing on events. The Economist is quoted 68 times.

People are fed up with both Tories and socialists. A vacuum, people are told, is beckoning--ideological, constitutional, moral. The system is breaking down, anti-politics rules, and soon. ""There's a new climate of pluralism,"" says Paddy Ashdown, the Liberal Democratic leader, who has taken to mentioning Ross Perot, the maverick American populist. Anything can happen anywhere, his rumination seems to imply. Prime minister Ashdown?
Soa Middle Party is surging, as it often has before. The Liberals, the Alliance, the Salads, the Social Democrats, the Lib Dems--whatever confusing third-party vegetable happens to be in vogue at the time--suddenly start winning by-elections by outrageous margins. Old hands are unimpressed.
Right now, however, a lot of Tory MPS are more rattled than they publicly let on. Most of them expect the Liberal Democrats, at the end of this month, to win the by-election at Christchurch, hitherto one of the safest Tory seats in the country. More people--not many, it must be admitted--pretend to keep a straight face when Mr Ashdown says he ""accepts no lesser aim than for my party to be the government."" What Roy Jenkins, the one-time Labour chancellor who is now leader of the Lib Dems in the Lords, used to call the ""great breakthrough"" (sounding, in his fruity diction, like a ""great grapefruit"") is once again earnestry discussed.
In statistical history, Britain has indeed been here before. In late 1981, Gallup reckoned that exactly half the population wanted to vote for the Alliance; two years later, 26% did, and it won just 23 seats. In 1985, the pollsters' figure hit 39%, but two years later, the Alliance won 23% of the vote and only 22 seats. Last year, the polls passed 20%, but at the general election the Lib Dems won 18% and 20 seats. Now, says Gallup, they are back up to 27%--knocking the Tories into third place for the first time this decade. ""So what?"", say the old hands. Wait for the real thing, a general election in 1997...
The Liberal Democrats naturally insist that circumstances are promisingly different. They have grown up. On a lot of issues, their policies remain pleasantry vague and inconsistent, but the disgruntled voters do not care a jot. The sandals, beards, woolly hats and single-issue obsessions are far less embarrassingly visible. ""You mustn't confuse the modern Liberal Democrats with the old Liberal Party,"" says Mr Ashdown. ""We're no longer the party of protest; we're the party of power.""
Such claims no longer sound silly. Just as Labour still has its sturdy electoral fortress in the decaying industrial north, so the Lib Dems have a chance of entrenching themselves much more deeply than before in the south, especially the southwest, where Tory MPS are sounding openly defeatist about their prospects at the next general election. If Labour loses its deposit in Christchurch, as it did in Newbury, the message to left-of-centre southerners may sink in: Lib Dems can replace Labour as the party of opposition in the less proletarian south. Georaphical concentration is the key: remember how in 1983 Labour won 209 seats to the Alliance's 23, with only 2 more votes. Fifty seats next time, say Lib Dem strategists, is now truly realistic.
Such hopes are nourished by deepening roots in local government. In the past dozen years, the number of Lib Dem councillors has trebled. Their party runs, alone or as the biggest party, more than a quarter of county councils in England and Wales. ""Build-up"", not ""breakthrough"", is the buzzword. Watch the Euro-election and the urban elections next summer.
The other clue to the future is how Lib Dem and Labour types are co-operating in counties like Berkshire and Hampshire or boroughs like Waverley in Surrey. Ordinary voters are watching to see if LibLab partnership can be fiscally sound. This raises the far more serious question of Lib-Labbery at the national level. A lot farther down the road, it is worth examining the prospect of a new social-democratic alternative to Tory rule, perhaps even an eventual merger of the civilised, free-market part of the Labour Party with the Lib Dems.
Such possibilities may be far-fetched. But they are more worth mulling over than ever before. The route would be tortuous and require bags of luck. Publicly, both parties shrink from pact chatter. It is electorally too dodgy. Many Tories still would not vote Liberal if that meant putting in Labour. Labour still hopes to win outright. The Lib Dems must still hope, at best, for a hung Parliament. Real coalition negotiations would start only after the election.
And Lib-Lab co-operation would be fraught. The promise by John Smith, the Labour leader, of a referendum on electoral reform (the Lib Dems' main demand) might not be quickly fulfilled. Britons might not say Yes. Even if LibLabbery went well, merger talk would not become serious until far into the next Parliament. It would mean a Labour split, and could take years to bear fruit. In any case, the whole idea could be stymied by the Tories winning the next election.
""I write merger off,"" says Mr Ashdown, for sensible tactical reasons. ""I simply write it off."" Nitty-gritty pact plotting is pointless at this stage. Under the surface, however, currents are stirring. Look to Scotland. People like Mr Smith, Donald Dewar and George Robertson for Labour, Sir David Steel, Menzies Campbell, Charles Kennedy and Archy Kirkwood for the Lib Dems are all very matey. They disagree on little. The Lib-Dem principle of equidistance from the big parties is eroding, and will erode faster if Mr Smith can shed his trade-union shackles.
""The best thing for British politics would be for true socialists to run up their flag and say who they are,"" says a leading Lib Dem, nodding at the prospect of a ""mainstream centre-left progressive social democratic party."" Many Tories agree, sotto voce, that their party needs a rest--out of power.
Formal Lib-Labbery is not on today's menu. But the feeling is growing acute that it is ludicrous for the modern end of the Labour Party not, in the longer term, to blend with the Lib Dems. Mr Ashdown probably thinks such sentiment is unduly academic, even self-defeating at this stage. Others near the top of his party are instinctively more amenable. If and when the great grapefruit comes, it might have to be pink.","You've heard it all before. People are fed up with both Tories and socialists. A vacuum, people are told, is beckoning--ideological, constitutional, moral. The system is breaking down, anti-politics rules, and soon. ""There's a new climate of pluralism,"" says Paddy Ashdown, the Liberal Democratic leader, who has taken to mentioning Ross Perot, the maverick American populist. Anything can happen anywhere, his rumination seems to imply. Prime minister Ashdown?
Soa Middle Party is surging, as it often has before. The Liberals, the Alliance, the Salads, the Social Democrats, the Lib Dems--whatever confusing third-party vegetable happens to be in vogue at the time--suddenly start winning by-elections by outrageous margins. Old hands are unimpressed.
Right now, however, a lot of Tory MPS are more rattled than they publicly let on. Most of them expect the Liberal Democrats, at the end of this month, to win the by-election at Christchurch, hitherto one of the safest Tory seats in the country. More people--not many, it must be admitted--pretend to keep a straight face when Mr Ashdown says he ""accepts no lesser aim than for my party to be the government."" What Roy Jenkins, the one-time Labour chancellor who is now leader of the Lib Dems in the Lords, used to call the ""great breakthrough"" (sounding, in his fruity diction, like a ""great grapefruit"") is once again earnestry discussed.
In statistical history, Britain has indeed been here before. In late 1981, Gallup reckoned that exactly half the population wanted to vote for the Alliance; two years later, 26% did, and it won just 23 seats. In 1985, the pollsters' figure hit 39%, but two years later, the Alliance won 23% of the vote and only 22 seats. Last year, the polls passed 20%, but at the general election the Lib Dems won 18% and 20 seats. Now, says Gallup, they are back up to 27%--knocking the Tories into third place for the first time this decade. ""So what?"", say the old hands. Wait for the real thing, a general election in 1997...
The Liberal Democrats naturally insist that circumstances are promisingly different. They have grown up. On a lot of issues, their policies remain pleasantry vague and inconsistent, but the disgruntled voters do not care a jot. The sandals, beards, woolly hats and single-issue obsessions are far less embarrassingly visible. ""You mustn't confuse the modern Liberal Democrats with the old Liberal Party,"" says Mr Ashdown. ""We're no longer the party of protest; we're the party of power.""
Such claims no longer sound silly. Just as Labour still has its sturdy electoral fortress in the decaying industrial north, so the Lib Dems have a chance of entrenching themselves much more deeply than before in the south, especially the southwest, where Tory MPS are sounding openly defeatist about their prospects at the next general election. If Labour loses its deposit in Christchurch, as it did in Newbury, the message to left-of-centre southerners may sink in: Lib Dems can replace Labour as the party of opposition in the less proletarian south. Georaphical concentration is the key: remember how in 1983 Labour won 209 seats to the Alliance's 23, with only 2 more votes. Fifty seats next time, say Lib Dem strategists, is now truly realistic.
Such hopes are nourished by deepening roots in local government. In the past dozen years, the number of Lib Dem councillors has trebled. Their party runs, alone or as the biggest party, more than a quarter of county councils in England and Wales. ""Build-up"", not ""breakthrough"", is the buzzword. Watch the Euro-election and the urban elections next summer.
The other clue to the future is how Lib Dem and Labour types are co-operating in counties like Berkshire and Hampshire or boroughs like Waverley in Surrey. Ordinary voters are watching to see if LibLab partnership can be fiscally sound. This raises the far more serious question of Lib-Labbery at the national level. A lot farther down the road, it is worth examining the prospect of a new social-democratic alternative to Tory rule, perhaps even an eventual merger of the civilised, free-market part of the Labour Party with the Lib Dems.
Such possibilities may be far-fetched. But they are more worth mulling over than ever before. The route would be tortuous and require bags of luck. Publicly, both parties shrink from pact chatter. It is electorally too dodgy. Many Tories still would not vote Liberal if that meant putting in Labour. Labour still hopes to win outright. The Lib Dems must still hope, at best, for a hung Parliament. Real coalition negotiations would start only after the election.
And Lib-Lab co-operation would be fraught. The promise by John Smith, the Labour leader, of a referendum on electoral reform (the Lib Dems' main demand) might not be quickly fulfilled. Britons might not say Yes. Even if LibLabbery went well, merger talk would not become serious until far into the next Parliament. It would mean a Labour split, and could take years to bear fruit. In any case, the whole idea could be stymied by the Tories winning the next election.
""I write merger off,"" says Mr Ashdown, for sensible tactical reasons. ""I simply write it off."" Nitty-gritty pact plotting is pointless at this stage. Under the surface, however, currents are stirring. Look to Scotland. People like Mr Smith, Donald Dewar and George Robertson for Labour, Sir David Steel, Menzies Campbell, Charles Kennedy and Archy Kirkwood for the Lib Dems are all very matey. They disagree on little. The Lib-Dem principle of equidistance from the big parties is eroding, and will erode faster if Mr Smith can shed his trade-union shackles.

Most Canadian federal elections in the past quarter-century have been decided on the voters' assessment of party leaders. So her test will come within a few weeks, when she embarks on the 47-day campaign for the election that is almost certain to take place before the end of October.
Ms Campbell has been doing her best to suggest a range of differences with Brian Mulroney's government, without repudiating any of its policies--which she could hardly do since she was first his minister of justice, and then of defence. Her answer is a new image, particularly of herself.
Mr Mulroney, prime minister for nine years until he retired in June, was mistrusted and unpopular except in his native Quebec. His efforts to unify Canadians through constitutional reform and to bring jobs through free-trade agreements were judged a failure. As defence minister, Ms Campbell herself had to defend the purchase of 50 military helicopters costing C$5.8 billion ($4.5 billion).
With the open look of a healthy blonde, she has reflected the sunny mood of summertime Canada. She has avoided controversial issues, preferring to be interviewed by disc jockeys than by political pundits. She has kept photographers busy with her cheerful hats, and she pitched a baseball competently. Flitting across Canada--on national day, July 1st, she greeted the dawn in Newfoundland and watched the sunset in her own British Colombia--she has shed some of her elitist skin. Mr Mulroney used to travel in limousines, but she took the subway in Toronto and walked the streets of Regina when paying a call on two provincial premiers. While the Mulroneys were furnishing their new mansion in Montreal with whirlpools in every bathroom and trying to sell their prime-ministerial furniture to the government, she was telling radio-show audiences that she had not even bought linen for her official residence.
As a first move towards fulfilling her promise--made when she was fighting for the party leadership--to eliminate the present C$32.6 billion federal deficit within five years, she cut the cabinet by eight ministers, and the civil service by nine government departments. She also refused to sign election nomination papers for three Quebec parliamentarians who face charges of misusing public funds; a step designed to appeal to supporters of the Reform Party, which has sprung to influence in western Canada. For Canadian nationalists who maintained that Mr Mulroney was a branch-plant American, Ms Campbell and her external affairs minister, Perrin Beatty, have managed to distance themselves a little: lifting a ban on aid to Cuba, opposing an air strike in Bosnia and holding out against sanctions in Bill Clinton's NAFTA side-deals (see page 21).
The summer has been less kind to Mr Chretien and the New Democrat leader, Audrey McLaughlin. Mr Chretien has been embroiled in squabbles with a dozen constituency associations, accused of using his position to ""parachute"" high-powered names on to the list of Liberal candidates. He was one of Pierre Trudeau's most energetic ministers but now, it seems, his folksy style belongs to an older generation of politics. For her part, Ms McLaughlin stumbled when, on August 11th, she bought an hour of network time for a ""television town-hall meeting"".

Now Canadians face a hard-to-forecast general election on October 25th, and a clouded future, whoever wins.
One cloud is political: there will probably be no outright winner. Canada has three major parties, but a first-past-the-post electoral system. So the Conservatives or the Liberals have usually managed to win an overall majority, leaving the New Democrats to play the national conscience, with occasional power in the provinces (as at present in Ontario, British Columbia and Saskatchewan). This year, though, two regional parties are doing well, the separatist Bloc Qubecois and the Alberta-based Reform Party. The best guess is that neither the Conservative prime minister, Kim Campbell, nor the Liberal leader, Jean Chretien, will win a clear majority of the 295 seats. Indeed neither may do better than 120.
This need not be worrying. Minority government is nothing new in Canada, nor need it mean stalemate. Lester Pearson headed two minority Liberal governments in the 1960s that brought in big welfare programmes. Pierre Trudeau had to govern for two years by the grace of the New Democrats, and paid for their support by creating the national oil corporation, Petro-Canada, which brought Canadians inside knowledge of a mainly foreign-owned industry.
Ms Campbell is trying for a third Conservative majority government, but takes pains to call it a first Campbell one, to distance herself from Brian Mulroney, who ended nine years as prime minister in deep unpopularity. In the short time she had before having to call an election, she worked hard on the barbecue circuit to make herself known and liked, but the 47 days of the election campaign will be the test of a relatively untried politician.
She was Mr Mulroney's minister of justice, and then of defence, for less than four years. Mr Chretien, in contrast, held almost all the important portfolios under Mr Trudeau. But few younger voters know or care. As one pollster put it this week, the choice is between a fresh leader with a tired party and a tired leader with a fresh party.
Ms Campbell is trying to get rid of one albatross, or rather seven, inherited from her own defence-ministry past. On September 2nd she announced she would cut from 50 to 43 the number of helicopters that Canada is to buy, still laden with equipment to spot Soviet submarines. Supposedly, this will save C$1 billion ($750m) of the original C$5.8 billion cost; but Ms Campbell's announcement has merely made the deal a live issue again. A nastier affair is still round her neck: a belated flow of revelations of murderous indiscipline in the Canadian Airborne Regiment in Somalia.
The real cloud is economic. With little sin of recovery, and the unemployment rate now at 11.6%, the main issue will be jobs and the recent cost-cutting by the federal government and all ten provincial ones. In the past fiscal year, their combined deficits totalled C$60 billion, nearly 9% of GDP. Ms Campbell, though talking of eliminating today's C$32.6 billion federal deficit within five years, has promised there will be no new or higher taxes. So thousands of civil servants fear for their jobs, other voters for social programmes, such as medicare and pensions.
Jobs will be the issue for the New Democrat leader, Audrey McLauhlin. She has a detailed plan to create 1-1/2m of them over five years, while reducing the deficit and holding taxes steady. This appealing snake-oil, based on investing in everything from modern transportation to a national child-care system, is her party's best hope of climbing from its present sorry 8% in opinion polls. Of its present 43 seats, mostly in western Canada, half are at risk.
The Liberals will publish their full platform only after a week of campaigning. If they are even to come close to a clear majority, they must take two-thirds of the 99 seats in Ontario and--more difficult--regain some 20 in Quebec that they lost to Mr Mulroney, a Quebecker. But the popular Lucien Bouchard and his Bloc Quebecois could win half of the 75 seats there, on the issue of the economy as much as Quebecois sovereignty.","They have enjoyed one of the sunniest summers they can remember .

For as long as most can remember, the federal government has been run by one of two parties, usually the Liberals but for the past nine years the Progressive Conservatives, with the New Democrats as a strong third party providing a social conscience. After the general election on October 25th, two regional parties, the Bloc Quebecois and the Reform Party, are expected to have knocked the traditional pattern aside.
Under Brian Mulroney, the Tories won two handsome victories, based on strong support both in Mr Mulroney's native Quebec and in oil-rich Alberta in western Canada. But these two Tory pillars grew wobbly when Kim Campbell took over the leadership in June; during the 47-day election campaign they have visibly crumbled. Ms Campbell, a lawyer from British Columbia who had difficulties in the French-language television debate, has seen Mr Mulroney's followers slide over to the Bloc Quebecois, which is expected to win most of Quebec's 75 seats. Meanwhile, Preston Manning, the son of a former premier of Alberta, has spread enthusiasm for the simple verities of his Reform Party--a balanced budget, smaller government, less immigration through western Canada and into Ontario.
The main pre-election question is whether the Liberals under Jean Chretien will win a narrow majority of the 295 seats, or have to struggle as a coalition or minority government. The Liberals have won support with their plausible plan for job-creation, a more attractive line--in a country with chronic unemployment now running above ll%--than Ms Campbell's insistence on reducing the budget deficit. But debts and deficits remain, and the new Reform MPS, plus whatever is left of the Tories, will undoubtedly chase the issue of economic management.
The Bloc Quebecois may well help Mr Chretien out on economic questions; its leader, Lucien Bouchard, places the party left of centre. But as a party fighting for Quebec sovereignty (a supposedly unfrightening form of separatism), it will otherwise be at logerheads with the Liberals. Somewhat in the tradition of Charles Stewart Parnell and Irish home rule in the British Parliament of the 1880s, its overriding object in coming to Ottawa is to fight for Quebec's interests and to prepare the way for Quebec's departure from the Canadian confederation within three years. Mr Bouchard's timetable is based on Quebec's provincial election next year, which his separatist ally (not contesting the federal election), the Parti Quebecois, may well win.
Mr Chretien's campaign has fared reasonably well in English Canada partly because people remember his long and respectable record in federal politics as Pierre Trudeau's lieutenant; by contrast Ms Campbell's way across the country has been littered with imprudent remarks. But Mr Chretien's links to Trudeau federalism, which offered no special treatment for Quebec, make him anathema to the nationalists around Mr Bouchard.
When battle is joined in the next constitutional round, it will be bruising. Mr Manning and his colleagues have shown no sympathy for Quebec's aspirations, and indeed their party has grown in reaction to Quebec's influence on Ottawa. The country, after October 25th, will be more divided than ever, though not yet fractured.","VOTERS are braced for a volcanic change in Canada 's political landscape . For as long as most can remember , the federal government has been run by one of two parties , usually the Liberals but for the past nine years the Progressive Conservatives , with the New Democrats as a strong third party providing a social conscience . After the general election on October 25th , two regional parties , the Bloc Quebecois and the Reform Party , are expected to have knocked the traditional pattern aside . 
 Under Brian Mulroney , the Tories won two handsome victories , based on strong support both in Mr Mulroney 's native Quebec and in oil - rich Alberta in western Canada . But these two Tory pillars grew wobbly when Kim Campbell took over the leadership in June ; during the 47 - day election campaign they have visibly crumbled . Kim Campbell has seen Mr Mulroney 's followers slide over to the Bloc Quebecois , which is expected to win most of Quebec 's 75 seats . Meanwhile , Preston Manning , the son of a former premier of Alberta , has spread enthusiasm for the simple verities of his Reform Party -- a balanced budget , smaller government , less immigration through western Canada and into Ontario . 
 The main pre - election question is whether the Liberals under Jean Chretien will win a narrow majority of the 295 seats , or have to struggle as a coalition or minority government . The Liberals have won support with their plausible plan for job - creation , a more attractive line -- in a country with chronic unemployment now running above ll%--than Kim Campbell's insistence on reducing the budget deficit . But debts and deficits remain , and the new Reform MPS , plus whatever is left of the Tories , will undoubtedly chase the issue of economic management .

As the long election campaign progressed, Jean Chretien grew more confident of winning a modest majority of the 295 seats in Canada's Parliament for his Liberal Party. On October 25th he succeeded, but perhaps a little too well. The Liberals won 177 seats and in the process devastated the other two traditional, federalist parties. The Progressive Conservatives, who held 157 seats at the start of this campaign, have been reduced to an absurd two. The New Democrats have sunk from 44 to nine.
In the debris of these old parties stand two fresh, dangerous opponents. The new groupings show up Canada's fault lines. The Liberals won all but one of the 32 seats in the four provinces of Atlantic Canada, and all but one of the 99 seats in Ontario. But they won less than one-third of the 75 seats in Quebec, where the separatist Bloc Quebecois took 54 and now becomes the official opposition. They also won only one third of the 89 seats lying west of Ontario, where the right-wing Reform Party took 51 (plus a solitary Ontario seat).
On election night Lucien Bouchard, for the Bloc, spoke of the aims (economic growth and job creation) that he shared with the Liberals; Preston Manning for the Reformers talked of the need to develop ""a new federalism"". Behind these polite sentiments lies the unpleasant fact that the two parties are protest movements with overwhelming strength in their regions--and antipathetic to one another.
There are straws to clutch in this high wind. The most substantial is the size of the Liberal majority. Mr Chretien will be able to stimulate the economy without worrying overmuch about criticism from the cost-cutting Reformers. He has a pretty good crew. Among the small contingents of Liberal MPS from western Canada and from Quebec are excellent newcomers, and his cabinet may be the most talented for a generation.
His party boasts a record number of 53 women MPS, including Ethel Blondin-Andrew, an Inuit from the Western Arctic, and Jean Augustine, who emigrated from Jamaica under the domestic workers programme to become head of Toronto's housing authority. And he himself is a reassuring presence. His reputation is a comfort after the mistrust that Brian Mulroney, the former Conservative leader, provoked; his experience (the prime ministership is his tenth portfolio) shows up well in contrast to the amateurish performance of Kim Campbell, who ends her brief spell as Conservative prime minister.
But on the most vital issue of all--whether or not Quebec will stay within Canada--he is hobbled by his past. As Pierre Trudeau's loyal lieutenant, he is linked to the policy of treating Quebec constitutionally like any other province. This makes it difficult for him to switch to a more flexible approach. Recognising this handicap, he appealed in his victory speech to Canadians to ""leave constitutional quarrels on the back burner"". Mr Bouchard, who stormed out of the Mulroney cabinet to form the Bloc Quebecois when the Meech Lake constitutional amendments failed in 1990, is hardly likely to agree.
Mr Bouchard's first words to his nationalist supporters on election night were to remind them of the defiance of Rene Levesque, Quebec's late premier, when he lost the referendum on sovereignty in 1980: ""We will see you next time"". For Mr Bouchard, that time will come if the Parti Quebecois (the Bloc's provincial ally) wins the provincial election next year--and honours Levesque's memory by winning, through another referendum, the mandate to carry Quebec and its 7m people to political sovereignty.
Optimists say that Monday's election has got rid of under cover manoeuvres and ambiguity: the Quebec issue will now have to be settled in a straightforward manner. Some even suggest that the Bloc's MPS will be converted to federalism through the chemistry of companionship in Ottawa and the give-and-take of question time.
But the old way of placating Quebec nationalism was to slip lucrative contracts to the province and allow its government more administrative power than any other. This would be hard for Mr Chretien. He has committed himself to cancelling the Tories' controversial C$5.8 billion ($4.4 billion) contract for military helicopters, much of which would have flowed to Quebec. And if he offers Quebec other plums, he will risk loud shouts from the Reform Party.
LOST IN THE DEBRIS
Meanwhile, the Conservatives and the New Democrats have to burrow their way out of the rubble. The surviving Tory MPS are an ill-matched pair: Jean Charest, who ran a close second to Ms Campbell for the leadership in June, and Elsie Wayne, a former New Brunswick mayor. Kim Campbell herself, having carried the weight of Mr Mulroney's unpopularity across Canada in an exhausting campaign, made a graceful exit on losing her Vancouver seat.
She may continue as party leader for a year or more, while rebuilding begins. More than 2m Canadians voted Conservative--more than for the Bloc Quebecois--and her party could have held some 20 seats in Ontario if the intervention of Reform candidates had not handed them to Liberals. The Conservatives still have a power base in the Senate, which Mr Mulroney brazenly packed before his departure.
The New Democrats, too, were humbled. Their leader, Audrey McLaughlin, survived in the Yukon, as did six others in the Prairies, the party's most secure base. But they were eliminated in Ontario, where Bob Rae's provincial government is unpopular, and almost wiped out in British Columbia for a similar reason--Michael Harcourt's NDP government lost support both for its tough measures on the deficit and for a compromise on the logging of Clayoquot rainforest that enraged environmentalists.
The New Democrats picked an uninspiring campaign issue--anxiety about the trade agreements with the United States and Mexico--and yielded ground to Mr Chretien, who concentrated steadily on the hope of good times ahead. But the NDP probably retains its niche to the left of the Liberals as a party of social conscience (so long as that is still relevant). By contrast, the Conservatives, or what remains of them, are squeezed between the Liberals moving to the right and the Reform Party surging from the far-right. Kim Campbell's final affectionate words to her followers on election night--""Consider yourselves hugged""--may carry a more ominous meaning.","His wildest dream , or a nightmare ?

Maybe not much. But it is just possible that the rout of the ruling parties in Italy last weekend and in Canada last month are part of the same phenomenon. Certainly, voters in both countries turned to regional and protest parties in unprecedented numbers, putting Alessandra Mussolini into a run-off to become mayor of Naples (see page 53) and sending Kim Campbell, after a brief spell as prime minister of Canada, into political oblivion. Certainly, voters in other established democracies are showing signs of an increasing readiness to desert the familiar parties of old. In all sorts of places it looks as though the mortar binding supporters to their parties is coming loose.
If so, it would not be surprising. For years, political parties in the old democracies have been struggling. Their decline has perhaps been most acute in America, where the rise of single-issue groups and the ability of congressmen to win elections with virtually no help from their party has sharply diminished the influence of parties. In America, as in other countries, society has been growing less cohesive, more granulated. In Europe the Catholic church carries less authority than it used to. Everywhere unions have lost influence. Education, switching jobs and moving up the class ladder have made people less inclined to take their politics from their parents and more inclined to form, and change, their own political opinions. Individualism is in the ascendant. In all mature democracies, voters are less deferential, more critical, than they were.
All this was true even before the collapse of communism in 1989. That collapse, of course, wrought most of its destructiveness upon totalitarians, but it was inevitable that it would also affect democratic socialists and, less directly, all those who defined their ideology partly in opposition to communism. Today it looks as though the defeat of one ideology, communism, has not so much invigorated its opponent as made it a commonplace: now that everyone claims to believe in democracy and market economics, the creed has lost some of its zest. Parties no longer need to proclaim it. In the absence of a new competitor, the consequence is a weakening of ideology in general.
Take away ideology from political parties and they can still operate; they can make their appeal in terms of their ability to satisfy their supporters' interests. But if they fail to convince the voters of this ability, there is little underlying loyalty to draw on--which may be why Canada's Tories fell from 43% of the vote and 170 seats in Parliament in 1988 to 16% and two seats in 1993. Moreover, despite the voters' growing suspicion of unions and churches and other traditional organisations, they still like to feel they belong to something. Increasingly, that something is their region or nationality or tribe. Hence the rise of regional parties not just in Canada and Italy but also in Spain and even Britain. Hence too the rise of racists.
It would be a mistake to expect political parties everywhere to start to disintegrate. Governing parties were returned to power this year in Australia, New Zealand (just), Norway and Spain. And even in the countries where their counterparts were thrown out--Canada, France, Greece and Japan--other parties took their place. But in many of these places some pretty unusual changes occurred. The big winner in Norway was the Centre Party, fiercely opposed to Norwegian membership of the European Union (formerly the EC). In France, the Socialists and their allies saw their seats in parliament drop by three-quarters, from 282 in 1988 to 70. In Japan, the Liberal Democrats, who had ruled uninterrupted for 38 years, were sent into opposition. In Germany, which will hold 19 elections of various kinds next year, voters are already showing signs of disillusion with the established parties and are turning not just to the fringes but to alternative parties of the centre (see page 56).
POWER TO THE PEOPLE
Where will the weakening of ideology and the erosion of party loyalty lead? In elections that the voters judge relatively insignificant--by-elections, local elections (like Italy's last weekend), Euro-elections--the likely result is more successes for regional parties, personalities (such as Ross Perot), racists, greens and others outside the mainstream. Where opposition parties look as inadequate as governing parties, these outsiders may even triumph in general elections, though usually at general elections the voters' desire to register a raspberry is tempered by the knowledge that to cast an irresponsible ballot can lead to serious damage at a national level.
In theory, weak parties might make it easier for dictators to come to power. In practice, no mature democracy looks ripe for dictatorship: press and television, plus the scepticism that is so corrosive to the party system, make it hard for autocrats to get going nowadays. But in places where they can, the people themselves may start to seize power; this is already happening in America, whose politics has never had a strong ideological flavour. If the parties do not make a comeback, direct democracy will grow. Referendums of one kind or another may become a much more familiar feature of western government.","What do the rise of a glamorous neo-fascist in Naples and the fall of a glamorous Tory in British Columbia have in common?

Where will the weakening of ideology and the erosion of party loyalty lead? In elections that the voters judge relatively insignificant--by-elections, local elections (like Italy's last weekend), Euro-elections--the likely result is more successes for regional parties, personalities (such as Ross Perot), racists, greens and others outside the mainstream. Where opposition parties look as inadequate as governing parties, these outsiders may even triumph in general elections, though usually at general elections the voters' desire to register a raspberry is tempered by the knowledge that to cast an irresponsible ballot can lead to serious damage at a national level.
In theory, weak parties might make it easier for dictators to come to power. In practice, no mature democracy looks ripe for dictatorship: press and television, plus the scepticism that is so corrosive to the party system, make it hard for autocrats to get going nowadays. But in places where they can, the people themselves may start to seize power; this is already happening in America, whose politics has never had a strong ideological flavour. If the parties do not make a comeback, direct democracy will grow. Referendums of one kind or another may become a much more familiar feature of western government.",20,Canada,A29-145,,False,,0,True

Only one journalist turns up. Councillors of all stripes rush to support each other in demanding more government money for the city; and the only mention of the border with the Republic of Ireland, just a few miles from the city, concerns the state of the roads leading to it. For once, it is possible to see Northern Ireland as a community, not two warring factions.
It was therefore natural that Albert Reynolds, the Irish Republic's prime minister, should visit Derry on November 19th as part of the current Anglo-Irish efforts to secure peace for Northern Ireland. It was not ever thus. The city was the epicentre of the modern troubles that began in 1969: home of the civil-rights movement and scene of Bloody Sunday, when British soldiers killed 13 Catholics. Its very name is a political issue--Derry for Catholics, Londonderry for Protestants and Londonderry/Derry for those few trying to remain neutral.
Yet today, on the city council, Catholics and Protestants work in reasonable harmony. The offices of mayor and deputy mayor rotate between the majority nationalist Social and Democratic Labour Party (SDLP) and the Unionist parties. Sinn Fein, the political (and legal) wing of the IRA, also shares committee positions, though has not yet provided a mayor. Unlike, say, Belfast council, notorious for being a political bearpit, Derry's council mostly avoids sectarian shouting matches. Gregory Campbell, the local leader of Ian Paisley's extreme Protestant Democratic Unionist Party, moans about alleged slights to his community, but bitterness rarely mars council meetings.
This civic peace is reflected in relative freedom from the troubles. Only one death by terrorism has been recorded in the city this year, though the recent loyalist killing of seven people in the Rising Sun bar at Greysteel, a village near Derry, is a terrible warning against complacency.
Co-operation has brought rewards to Derry. In the middle of nowhere, and with the traditional linen industry all but dead, it ought to be an economic disaster. Male unemployment, at 26%, is indeed painfully high. And yet everywhere there are signs of economic growth. The city centre increasingly resembles a modern European city, with construction of the new Richmond shopping centre by O'Connell Development, a Boston company, under way. Seagate, an American computer company, has decided to locate directly opposite a science and technology park built by the University of Ulster at its Magee College campus. Near the city, Fruit of the Loom, an American clothing company, has recently invested L50m in its ultra-modern cotton-spinning plant, providing 170 jobs and planning to add 410 more by 1997.
Clean water and clean air help to attract industry, as do local facilities: pools, schools, golf courses. So does generous help from Northern Ireland's Industrial Development Board. So, in particular, do the American contacts of the local MP, John Hume, leader of the SDLP, whose talks with Gerry Adams, Sinn Fein's president, have launched Northern Ireland on its latest, and perhaps most confusing, peace initiative. Mr Hume accepts that his efforts on behalf of Derry's economy have succeeded only because the city council is able to make a united pitch to would-be investors, across sectarian lines.
""Derry is a philosophical model for Northern Ireland,"" says Mark Durkan, SDLP chairman and a Derry councillor. ""We've never seen our majority here as conferring proprietorial rights.""

It is the drama of the country's two top women ice-sakters, a drama climaxing nicely as the winter Olympics in Norway approach. The truth about the shocking attempt to maim Nancy Kerrigan by clubbing her on the leg with an aluminum truncheon just before the American championship in Detriot last month is now emerging. The truth about the public obsession with the affair remains murkier.
The two star characters are, of course, portrayed as a complete contrast. Miss Kerrigan, recovering well from the attck and on her way to the Olympics, combines grace and beauty with perfect manners. She comes from a humble family (her father was a welder from Stoneham, Massachusetts), but a stable and supportive one. Her mother is blind; Nancy does charity work for the blind. She says all the right things (""The most important thing is to be happy and healthy"") while flashing her film-star teeth. She is like Miss America on skates.
Tonya Harding says all the wrong things (""What I'm really thinking about are dollar signs,"" she blurted out after winning the American championship in the absence of Miss Kerrigan). Shorter, plainer and earthier than Miss Kerrigan, she indulges in drag-racing, hunting and pool. Part of her tough childhood was spent living in a trailer. Her family was a disaster--she was a product of the fifth of her mother's six marriages--and so was her own marriage to Jeff Gillooly, who had confessed to his part in the plot to wound Miss Kerrigan.
Now, in a plea bargain, Mr. Gillooly has alleged that his ex-wife was also involved in the plan. Miss Harding denies it and has not been charged. But her trail-by-media is putting her Olympic place at risk. Fortunately, she keeps tumbling over in front of the cameras. Her dream of defeating her rival and reaping the rewards is close to ruins.
But was that dream ever really achievable? The unmentionable fact is that the commercial appeal of women's ice-skating, the reason why stars like Germany's gorgeous Katerina Witt are such hot property, is only partly related to skill in the rink. Ice-skaters wear skimpy costumes and are favoured if they look pretty. Sex-appeal sells. And Tonya (no commercial endorsements) Harding will never be as saleable as Nancy (Seiko, Campbell soup, Reebok, Evian water, Northwest airlines) Kerrigan.
Miss Kerrigan is so appealing to sponsors because she can sell an American dream; she represents the way millions of Americans would like to be. But the greater fascination, reflected in the greater acreage of newsprint and hours of television footage, is with Miss Harding. Without film-star good looks, from a broken home, driven by a ruthless ambition, she may be closer to what a lot of real America is like.","The top story in America has nothing to do with health-care reform or the economy.

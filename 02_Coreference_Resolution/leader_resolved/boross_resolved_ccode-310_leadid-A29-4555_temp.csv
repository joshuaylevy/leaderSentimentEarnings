Hungarians gave Horthy the kind of funeral usually reserved For national heroes. But the event provoked many questions about Hungary's new democracy, both in Hungary and among its suspicious neighbours.
Over 20,000 people surrounded the family crypt in Horthy's native Kenderes. Among them: boy-scouts, skinheads, men wearing pre-war military uniforms, leaders of the far-right Hungarian Justice Party--and eight ministers from the coalition government, nearly half the cabinet. The funeral was televised. People and cameras came to pay tribute to what the interior minister, Peter Boross, called Horthy's ""manly virtues"" and ""indestructible Hungarian-ness"". Jozsef Antall, the prime minister, did not attend. But he sent his wife and son, and said on television that he considered Horthy ""a Hungarian patriot"".
Quite a revival in popularity for a man better known for his alliance with Nazi Germany, for his acquiescence in the deportation of hundreds of thousands of Jews and for his role in Hungary's campaign to regain territories lost to Slovakia, Romania and Yugoslavia at the Trianon peace treaty of 1920. And quite a revival in respect, too. Horthy had been a figure of fun : the admiral of a landlocked country, the regent of a country without a king.
Plenty of Hungarians see no sinister contemporary implications in this. Horthy's role has to be re-assessed, they say, to offset communist distortions of history. Perhaps. But politicians from the prime minister down have concentrated on his anticommunism rather than the anti-semitism that thrived under his regime. Jewish and liberal organisations commemorated the victims of the Horthy regime at emotional demonstrations on the eve of the funeral. Many Hungarians also asked whether the country can afford a draining re-examination of its past while enduring the pain of economic reform. Why now?
There are at least four theories. One is that the government, which is struggling to defend a thin Parliamentary majority, wants to tap the authoritarian traditions of the Horthy era. Another, promoted by newspapers in neighbouring countries, is that Hungary's rulers want to revive Horthy's campaign to dissolve the Trianon treaty. A third is that the reburial is a stunt to boost the government's support before elections next spring that opinion polls say it will lose.
The simplest explanation, though, may be the most convincing: conservatives want to remind Hungarians of their history because ""without a past, there is no future."" Thus Mr Antall, a historian by training like many of his ministers. ""Horthy should be placed into the continuity of the nation and the awareness of the people."" Fine. But which Horthy? And whose history?","More than 40 years of communist rule have given a wondrous gloss to the reputation of Admiral Miklos Horthy, the controversial Regent of Hungary during the second world war, who was reburied last weekend.

So it was with Jozsef Antall, prime minister of Hungary, who died on December 12th aged 61. Mr Antall had held office since his conservative Hungarian Democratic Forum won the election in 1990. This made him Eastern Europe's longest-serving head of government.
Three and a half years was also enough to make Mr Antall a giant among the pygmies in his party, and an embodiment of the stability that has distinguished Hungary from most of its East European neighbours and helped to attract half of all foreign investment that has flowed to the region. Hungarians had found it hard to imagine politics--or at least stable politics--without him. His illness (non-Hodgkin's lymphoma) had lasted a year and prompted speculation, tinged with Hungarian hysteria, about every consequence from a leadership struggle to a right-wing putsch and a state of emergency.
In fact, political life has flowed on smoothly. Within a day of his death, the Forum nominated Peter Boross, the interior minister and caretaker prime minister, to take over. The Forum's two coalition partners have lined up loyally behind that choice.
Mr Boross, a 65-year-old who made a career in the catering industry, may lack his predecessor's subtlety, sense of political balance and obvious integrity. Moreover, he is prone to incendiary remarks, once calling Amnesty International a bunch of ""over-sensitive liberal philanthropists"". But he compensates with administrative competence, plain speaking and a forceful personality. Not to mention good health and the physical ability to fight a tough election campaign that would have exhausted an ailing Mr Antall.
The Forum's pleasure in discovering that no politician is irreplaceable may not be matched when it realises that the same is true of governments. Elections are scheduled for May and opinion polls show the Forum in fourth place with 10% of the vote. The Hungarian Socialist Party, the ex-communists, topped the rankings for the first time this week, scoring 25% of the vote--yet another sign of the return of former communists across Eastern Europe.","Leaders often seem irreplaceable -- until they are replaced .

In June Mr Hata's people defected from the long-ruling and long-corrupt Liberal democratic Party (Lop); now Ml. Hata is part of a new coalition government that promises to cleanse politics. The Social Democrats (formerly the Socialists) are also part of that government. If Mr Hata's toadiness offends too many allies, the coalition could collapse. Political reform would crash with it.
One test will come on September 18th, when the Social Democrats elect a new party leader. The outgoing chief, Sadao Yamahana, meekly agreed to coalition policies that contradicted his own party's leftist foibles, such as supporting Stalinist North Korea. Indeed, on September 4th Mr Yamahana demonstrated his willingness to please by becoming the first Social Democratic leader to visit South Korea.
Mr Yamahana's preferred successor, Wataru Kubo, would carry on this pragmatism. He enjoys the support of most Social democratic members of the Diet. But the rank and file are disgusted by Mr Yamahana's softness, so a leftist victory is just possible.
Other parties could disrupt the coalition. Ichiro Ozawa, the string-puller behind Mr Hata, plans to make the Renewal Party the biggest non-LDP group. He is talking to two other coalition members, the Buddhist-linked Clean Government Party and the small democratic Socialist Party, about a possible merger. Less openly, he is wooing some 20 LDP parliamentarians; he has approached a few right-win Social Democrats too. This might produce a group with 150 members in the lower house The LDP has 225; other parties have 135.
Mr Ozawa's plan is a threat to other coalition members. The Japan New Party of the prime minister, Morihiro Hosokawa, is planning a more modest merger with the small New Party Harbinger of Masayoshi Takemura. Mr Ozawa and Mr Takemura get on badly. The battle lines for the next election, expected next year, are forming.
Yet rivalries are not blocking compromises on important issues. The Ozawa and Takemura camps disagreed, initially, on what kind of electoral system should replace Japan's multi-member constituencies, which are costly to manage and so encourage corruption. They have now settled on 250 single-seat constituencies, with another 250 seats parcelled out through proportional representation. This represents a con cession by Mr Ozawa, who had wanted to weaken smaller parties by having just 200 proportionally chosen seats and 300 constituencies. In exchange, Mr Ozawa got the coalition to drop its plan to ban political donations from companies. Mr Ozawa has lots of tycoons as backers.
For the moment, the government is popular. A poll by Kyodo news agency, which put the approval rating of the old LDP government at 22% In May, reported on September 8th that the Hosokawa cabinet has a record 79% rating. To keep its appeal, the government needs to stimulate the economy. The central bank is expected to chip in with an interest-rate cut and the government says it will announce a fiscal stimulus on September 20th.
The government also has a committee looking into ways of passing the benefits of the strong yen to consumers, by cutting prices for imported goods, among them as and international telephone calls. Another panel is studying tax reform. Yet another is working on an ambitious plan to deregulate the economy and so make it more open to imports. Japan's big newspapers are redeploying their reporters to beef up political coverage: businessmen and bureaucrats used to pull the strings, but the initiative is shifting to the politicians.",""" Toads selling wart medicine "" is how one Social democratic member of the Diet describes the Japan Renewal Party of Tsutomu Hata .

The president started the ""framework"" talks between America and Japan seven months ago, when Kiichi Miyazawa, an old-guard Liberal Democrat, led Japan. A deadline of February 11th had been set for agreement on ways to open up Japanese markets. The odds for success ought to have been raised when the coalition led by Morihiro Hosokawa, Japan's reformist prime minister, came to power. Since Mr. Clinton and Mr. Hosokawa were obliged to admit, on February 12th, that their talks had come to naught, the future of the two countries' trade relations has been thrown perilously open.
Plenty of blame is being bandied about. The Americans accuse Japanese negotiators of over-literalness during the discussions: ""slippery"" is the word some are using. This attitude, say the Americans, ruled out serious discussion of a more general commitment to open markets in Japan. It led the Americans to insist on those infamous ""targets"" for a larger market share in various Japanese sectors, such as cars, car parts, public procurement and medical equipment. For their part, the Japanese-crying ""managed trade""--say they had no choice but to dig in their heels over targets that bureaucrats and politicians were either unable or unwilling to deliver.
American negotiators also complain that, until the final days of the talks, the political commitment in Japan to an agreement was simply not there. On the American side, the framework talks had been coordinated with smooth unanimity from within the White House, through the new National Economic Council (NEC). In Japan, it was the foreign ministry that took the lead. For most of the time, bureaucrats were in charge; ministers, according to one American negotiator, seemed to be reading from briefing notes.
Late in the night of February 10th, progress briefly seemed possible. After dining with Mr. Hosokawa at Blair House, Japan's foreign minister, Tsutomu Hata, called for a meeting between himself, America's trade representative, Mickey Kantor, Bowman Cutter from the NEC and Japan's chief trade negotiator. The prepared texts were put away. The Americans said they were ready to put in writing that various ""indicators"" of market share would not later be used as ""targets"". They admitted to certain a ""awkwardnesses"" in the American stand: that, for instance, it was hard to insist on a hefty market share for American cars since Detroit barely produced any right-hand-drive models. Had such awkwardnesses been brought out earlier, the talks might have been saved. As it was, the Americans had boxed both sides into a corner, and time had run out.
A majority of the administration's trade people privately feel some sympathy with the Japanese, and admit that the attempts negotiate market-share targets with Japan have run their course. The Japanese do not easily forget the 1986 semiconductor accord, when they agreed that the Americans should aim for a greater share of Japan's semiconductor market. The desired share, 20%, was quickly interpreted by the Americans as being a firm commitment. Now the Japanese are being attacked because that share has diminished. Yet the market is growing rapidly, benefiting American and Japanese chipmakers alike.
Yet if market-share targets are to be abandoned, the administration is not at all clear what should take their place. In the meantime, the pressure for face-saving retaliation against Japan is growing. On February 15th Mr. Kantor announced that America was drawing up a list of sanctions against Japanese products, worth several hundred million dollars, because Japan had reneged on agreements to grant Motorola, an American company, greater access to Japan's cellular-phone market.
This is a long-simmering dispute, and one unconnected with the framework talks. Mr. Kantor said it had nothing to do with targets or market share. But the administration's response has been hurried forward, and the issue is bound to be thrown into the argument.
So, too, is the desire by both Congress and the administration to reinstate the ""Super 301"" provision of America's trade laws. This grants America broad unilateral powers to find, and retaliate against, allegedly discriminatory trade practices by other countries. It is an unwelcome time for Super 301 to be revived. As it is, according to some estimates, America's anti-dumping actions, countervailing duties and the like disrupt as much international trade as Japan's anti-competitive practices. A vigorous use of Super 301 would not only do more to disrupt trade; it would also undermine the multilateral efforts to improve dispute-settlement procedures that have just been agreed under the Uruguay round of trade talks.
It is not yet certain that Mr. Clinton, who seems determined now to take personal charge of America's economic relations with Japan, will head down the jinoistic path. He may prefer to wait for Mr. Hosokawa to deliver on the promises he has made to the Japanese to free the economy of regulations that keep prices iniquitously high. America, certainly, has a legitimate interest in such issues. But instead of gauging its interest in terms of market share, argues Gary Saxonhouse of the University of Michigan, it should look instead at price structures in various Japanese sectors. Where in Japan are prices out of line with other countries, after taking distribution and transport costs into account? The administration has done woefully little work on the matter.
In the absence of any new trade policy towards Japan, America has turned back to an old and rather clumsy lever, the exchange rate. Since the collapse of the trade talks, the yen has soared, threatening to break through Y100 to the dollar (see page 85). The administration professes to remain aloof from these market exertions. It is, of course, delighted that a strong yen could squeeze Japanese exporters so hard that they will beg their bureaucrats to cede to American trade demands.
The administration also hopes that a strong yen will help to cut Japan's $60-billion trade surplus with America, particularly if Japan, despite its promises, fails to ease its fiscal constraint. A strong yen might well help to cut the surplus (though the surplus is neither bad in itself nor a measure of Japan's trade barriers), but that is not the point. What matters is whether the yen is near its ""equilibrium"" level vis-a-vis the dollar. If that equilibrium is nearer Y110-115--and economists at the Treasury Department were prepared to admit as much only a few months ago--then the yen has overshot. The administration's goading of the exchange rate will therefore have produced more long-term economic distortions than short-term political gains.","It was an outcome that Bill Clinton 's administration could see coming from a long way off , but did little to prevent .

After the second world war, Britain adjusted to its diminished power by becoming the Americans' soundest friend in Europe. France had Gaullist anti-Americanism, Germany a greenish, left-wing sort, and Russia was plain hostile. America needed a dependable ally in the world's second richest continent.
Now Asia is where money gets made, and Japan could render itself similarly useful. Plain hostility is awake in North Korea, and sleeps fitfully in China. Tetchy allies abound. South Korea, though protected from the North by American troops, periodically succumbs to anti-American riots. Indonesia and Malaysia are both charmed by the anti-American ideas of the non-aligned movement.
Japan has motive enough to help America. Diplomatic help might soothe American fury at Japan's vast trade surplus, which has recently erupted into threats of sanctions. This bust-up has driven up the yen, hurting Japan's exporters and dimming hopes of shaking off recession. Having stoutly rejected America's demands for ""numerical targets"" to measure progress in opening their market to foreign goods, some Japanese now seem to be wavering. A senior politician has suggested ""effort goals"", which might include some numbers.
Helpful, British-style diplomacy might also sustain America's appetite for guaranteeing Japanese security. The end of the cold war has encouraged some Japanese to feel that they can act independently of America, and the Americans are even more tempted to play down the alliance. The post-cold-war threats, notably from North Korea, are more local than was Russian communism. Japan therefore needs American protection more than America needs a vast military base on the northern rim of Asia.
At first sight Japan seems bad at using Asian ties to cement its alliance with America; indeed it seems limp in all multilateral diplomacy. On February 21st Jeffrey Garten, a senior American trade official, began a two-week trip to Asia by asking his hosts to back America in its trade row with Japan. Meanwhile, the Americans also solicited support from Sir Leon Brittan, the European Union's top trade man. Japan, for its part, has merely threatened to refer American trade sanctions to the GATT. That is more than it has ventured during past trade rows, but still mild compared to American swashbuckling.
And yet Japan's diplomats have not been idle. They have succeeded, since the start of this year, in greatly strengthening ties with China. On February 23rd Zhu Rongji, China's vice premier and top economics man, arrived in Japan for a nine-day visit, praising the two countries' booming trade and declaring his interest in Japan's economic model. This comes on top of a visit by Japan's foreign minister, Tsutomu Hata, to China in January; in March Morihiro Hosokawa, the prime minister, is due to follow.
This chumminess is being used to help America. Mr Hata asked his Chinese hosts why their military budget had grown 15% in the 1993 fiscal year, and urged them not to transfer missile technology to the world's undesirables. He also asked for Chinese help in getting North Korea to open its doors to international nuclear inspectors. This straight talk reinforced American demands on the Chinese. It also represented a change: Japan has until recently been shy of criticising its vast neighbour.
This formula--make friends, then use the friendship to help America--may be repeated elsewhere. Japan's vast aid budget is spent mostly in Asia, which is also attracting a growing share of private Japanese investment. These money flows were sweetened last year, when Mr Hosokawa eased Asian memories of the second world war by apologising for Japan's excesses. This has improved relations most notably with South Korea. In March its president, Kim Young Sam, will visit Tokyo.
Japan has already used its clout to squash a Malaysian idea for something called an East Asian Economic Caucus, which would exclude America; instead, Japan backed the Asia-Pacific Economic Forum, which includes it. Japan also helps to maintain Asia's consensus in favour of keeping American troops in the region. It maintains links with the unpleasant government in Myanmar (Burma), whereas the Americans shun it. But even here, the Japanese use their contacts with Myanmar's officials to deliver America's pro-democracy message.
Japan may one day prove most helpful in a way that seems Far-fetched today--namely, on trade. As Japan opens its markets to foreign goods, Asia's dynamic exporters are the obvious next target for America's irritation with its own current-account deficit. How convenient for America if the Japanese, having experienced the full force of America's battering ram, advised other Asian countries that there is little point in resisting it.","What , mused a Japanese diplomat this month , could his country learn from Britain 's relationship with America ?

1994-04-09,https://www-proquest-com.proxy.uchicago.edu/abicomplete/docview/224147032/fulltext/C10C7A09F797437EPQ/18?accountid=14657,"It is the early 1980s. An ambitious local politician needs money. Some dodgy loans are made and dubious share deals done. A decade later the politician finds himself in charge of his country--a white hope from the provinces, untainted by the sleaze of the capital. But after an auspicious star, things start to go wrong, and little can be heard except the flapping of chickens coming home to roost.
Those who urge Japan to be more like the West must find irony in the similarity between the political troubles of Morihiro Hosokawa and Bill Clinton. But in Japan it is no laughing matter. The scandal enveloping its prime minister is paralysing the government. It cannot even get its budget passed, let alone deal sensibly with such irritations as Mickey Kantor and Kim Il Sung.
The scandal began with the friendship between Mr Hosokawa and Kiyoshi Sagawa. Mr Sagawa ran a trucking company in Kyoto. His friendship with Mr Hosokawa began in 1979 when he rented, and lavishly renovated, the Hosokawa family mansion at Kumamoto on the southern island of Kyushu. Then, in September 1982, he gave Mr Hosokawa Y100m ($401,000).
What happened after this is a matter of dispute. Mr Hosokawa says that the money was a personal loan and was repaid in full before the end of the year. His political enemies in Japan's Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) claim that it was an illegal contribution to Mr Hosokawa's (successful) campaign to become governor of Kumamoto prefecture. They have challenged Mr Hosokawa to support his story with documents, but the only one he has produced is a photocopied receipt for the money dated September 31st.
Reinventing the calendar is not the only sin of which Mr Hosokawa stands accused. In 1986 he is alleged to have bought 300 shares in the newly privatised Nippon Telegraph and Telephone. He denies this too. He says the deal was done by his late father-in-law, although he admits arranging a loan to help his father-in-law carry it through. By ordering so many shares, which cost Y1.19m each, he (or his father-in-law) was able to benefit from a preferential allocation not available to Japan's small investors. Partly as a result, a profit of Y50m was made when 199 of the shares were later sold.
It would not, in fact, have been illegal for Mr Hosokawa to have made the deal himself. The real scandal, according to the LDP critics, was that because he seems to have been embarrassed by the deal he tried to cover it up. Shuzo Fujiki, the investment consultant said to have arranged the deal, has stated publicly that Masatoshi Miyama, who was then Mr Hosokawa's secretary, asked him to conceal the transaction.
LDP men want Mr Hosokawa to produce documentary evidence that the Sagawa loan was repaid. They also want Mr Miyama to give evidence to parliament which, with Mr Hosokawa's support, he is refusing to do. Until these conditions are met, the party will not take part in discussions on Japan's budget, which was supposed to have been in place at the beginning of April. At the moment, the country is running on a stop-gap 50-day budget passed hurriedly before the deadline, but this will expire on May 20th.
Constitutionally, the government could ignore the LDP. But if it did so, the LDP would probably pull out of all parliamentary committees, creating an awkward crisis in Japan's consensus-based political life. So what will happen next is anybody's guess. Mr Hosokawa has not, yet, even been charged with any wrong-doing, let alone convicted. The LDP has been courting some of his coalition partners, particularly the Social Democratic Party, but none has agreed to desert him, so his government would almost certainly survive a vote of confidence. More likely he will simply be dropped by his erstwhile friends.
Mr Hosokawa has already antagonised one of his most powerful supportersthe cabinet secretary, Masayoshi Takemura--by very publicly trying and failing to sack him. At the moment, his strongest hopes for survival lie in the fact that his most likely replacement, Tsutomu Hata (foreign minister, and head of the Japan Renewal Party), is also unacceptable to Mr Takemura's win of the coalition. But any further scandal could change that. The men in grey kimonos may be calling round very soon.","It is the early 1980s. An ambitious local politician needs money. Some dodgy loans are made and dubious share deals done. A decade later the politician finds himself in charge of his country--a white hope from the provinces, untainted by the sleaze of the capital. But after an auspicious star, things start to go wrong, and little can be heard except the flapping of chickens coming home to roost.
Those who urge Japan to be more like the West must find irony in the similarity between the political troubles of Morihiro Hosokawa and Bill Clinton. But in Japan it is no laughing matter. The scandal enveloping its prime minister is paralysing the government. It cannot even get its budget passed, let alone deal sensibly with such irritations as Mickey Kantor and Kim Il Sung.
The scandal began with the friendship between Mr Hosokawa and Kiyoshi Sagawa. Mr Sagawa ran a trucking company in Kyoto. His friendship with Mr Hosokawa began in 1979 when he rented, and lavishly renovated, the Hosokawa family mansion at Kumamoto on the southern island of Kyushu. Then, in September 1982, he gave Mr Hosokawa Y100m ($401,000).
What happened after this is a matter of dispute. Mr Hosokawa says that the money was a personal loan and was repaid in full before the end of the year. His political enemies in Japan's Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) claim that it was an illegal contribution to Mr Hosokawa's (successful) campaign to become governor of Kumamoto prefecture. They have challenged Mr Hosokawa to support his story with documents, but the only one he has produced is a photocopied receipt for the money dated September 31st.
Reinventing the calendar is not the only sin of which Mr Hosokawa stands accused. In 1986 he is alleged to have bought 300 shares in the newly privatised Nippon Telegraph and Telephone. He denies this too. He says the deal was done by his late father-in-law, although he admits arranging a loan to help his father-in-law carry it through. By ordering so many shares, which cost Y1.19m each, he (or his father-in-law) was able to benefit from a preferential allocation not available to Japan's small investors. Partly as a result, a profit of Y50m was made when 199 of the shares were later sold.
It would not, in fact, have been illegal for Mr Hosokawa to have made the deal himself. The real scandal, according to the LDP critics, was that because he seems to have been embarrassed by the deal he tried to cover it up. Shuzo Fujiki, the investment consultant said to have arranged the deal, has stated publicly that Masatoshi Miyama, who was then Mr Hosokawa's secretary, asked him to conceal the transaction.
LDP men want Mr Hosokawa to produce documentary evidence that the Sagawa loan was repaid. They also want Mr Miyama to give evidence to parliament which, with Mr Hosokawa's support, he is refusing to do. Until these conditions are met, the party will not take part in discussions on Japan's budget, which was supposed to have been in place at the beginning of April. At the moment, the country is running on a stop-gap 50-day budget passed hurriedly before the deadline, but this will expire on May 20th.
Constitutionally, the government could ignore the LDP. But if it did so, the LDP would probably pull out of all parliamentary committees, creating an awkward crisis in Japan's consensus-based political life. So what will happen next is anybody's guess. Mr Hosokawa has not, yet, even been charged with any wrong-doing, let alone convicted. The LDP has been courting some of his coalition partners, particularly the Social Democratic Party, but none has agreed to desert him, so his government would almost certainly survive a vote of confidence. More likely he will simply be dropped by his erstwhile friends.

The first non-Liberal Democratic government in 38 years has proved incapable of government. No replacement is likely to be cleaner or more cohesive. Thus runs the popular cynicism in Tokyo, after the announcement on April 8th by the prime minister, Morihiro Hosokawa, that he would resign over a financial scandal. Yet the truth is rather less depressing. Ever since electoral reform was enacted by parliament in March, Japan has been engaged in a second and no less worthwhile stage of its political reconstruction.
Mr Hosokawa's announcement on April 8th probably owed less to scandal than to policy. He has admitted receiving interest on a loan from Tokyo Sagawa Kyubin, a delivery company, and some unspecified irregularities in share dealing. None of this is recent; none involves big sums by the standards of Japan's politics; none is quite enough to explain his resignation. To see why, consider Mr Hosokawa's allies.
When Ichiro Ozawa, the power behind the coalition, was accused of corruption last year, he calmly declared that his past misbehaviour was proof of the need to reform politics. That misbehaviour involved raising cash for the Takeshita faction, the corrupt heart of the corrupt Liberal Democratic Party (LDP). Half of that faction later formed the Japan Renewal Party, which has supplied five of Mr Hosokawa's cabinet colleagues: it is a fair bet that all have more to be ashamed of than the departing prime minister. One of the five, Tsutomu Hata, seemed, at mid-week, likely to succeed Mr Hosokawa.
The real reason for Mr Hosokawa's resignation lies in the aftermath of his success in shoving electoral reform through parliament. The prime minister lost no time in announcing plans to reform Japan's clumsy tax system, which penalises salaried workers and favours the self-employed and the retired. To widen the tax net, Mr Hosokawa promised to shift the tax burden from incomes to consumption.
This angered the Social Democratic Party, the largest member of Mr Hosokawa's eight-party coalition, since consumption taxes are hard on the poorer Japanese who traditionally support it. The reform proposal also enraged Masayoshi Takemura, the leader of the New Harbinger Party, who stormed unannounced into Mr Hosokawa's office and screamed at him.
In the weeks that followed, Mr Hosokawa tried and failed to evict Mr Takemura from the cabinet. Mr Takemura and the Social Democrats withdrew support for Mr Hosokawa's modernising policies. Aside from tax reform, these include economic deregulation and a more assertive foreign policy.
Thus paralysed, Mr Hosokawa saw little virtue in staying on. So he resigned, hoping to build an alliance that could resume the business of reform later. And although the coalition seems likely to try to soldier on towards an election, the intrigue triggered by Mr Hosokawa's move has shown what a future pro-reform alliance might look like.
On the day he resigned, Mr Hosokawa launched a new parliamentary group called Reform. Rumours soon spread that the Hata-Ozawa Japan Renewal Party would join the Reform group, along with the Clean Government Party. The latter has no policies but lots of money to pay for election campaigning.
These three parties would give the Reform group around 150 members, about 100 short of the number required to form a majority in the lower house of parliament. To plug the gap, Mr Ozawa proposed to recruit Michio Watanabe, a Liberal Democratic baron; Mr Watanabe's vigorous foreign-policy views fit well with the Reformers. For two days Mr Watanabe tried to persuade enough party colleagues to join him. He failed. As a result, the Reform gang seems to have resigned itself to sticking with the old coalition for the moment.
While the shape of a future modernising party could thus be glimpsed, so too could that of a traditionalist opposition. The New Harbingers and Social Democrats were canvassing support from other Liberal Democratic groups that share the view that Japan should stick by its pacifist constitution. Kiichi Miyazawa, a former prime minister, is a prominent LDP traditionalist. The Social Democrats and Liberal Democrats both have rural supporters who dislike deregulation of agriculture. In this they stand opposed to the urban-based Reformers.
Both wins of the LDP seem, for the moment, to have decided not to defect. The party remains easily Japan's biggest. By sticking together it may regain power at the next election. Yet the LDP's unity is soon to face a test. The redrawing of constituency boundaries, which should be completed this autumn, will oblige the party's bosses to sever some parliamentarians from their old districts. The new boundaries' victims will make ready recruits for other parties.","The country's cleanest politician is dirty after all.

The man who by mid-week seemed almost certain to lead Japan has survived years in politics without making enemies.
Mr Hata has a hard act to follow. Morihiro Hosokawa, the outgoing prime minister, had the fortune to follow 38 years of unbroken rule by the corrupt Liberal Democratic Party (LDP). That, plus a telegenic smile, gave him record ratings in opinion polls. Late last year more than 70% said they supported his cabinet, compared with the 10% that backed the LDP during its last months in power.
These days it is harder to be popular. Eight months of non-LDP government have coincided with recession. Although Mr Hosokawa did keep several of his promises--electoral reform, an apology for Japan's war crimes, some deregulation--his term ended amid bickering among coalition allies and financial scandal. Mr Hosokawa's appeal owed much to his background as a provincial governor, which set him apart from the cynical dealings of the capital. Mr Hata has spent nearly all his career in national politics.
Mr Hata's cabinet and policies will hardly differ from his predecessor's. He will also be just as vulnerable to coalition bickering. The most divisive issue is tax reform, which delayed Mr Hata's anointment for several days. His Japan Renewal Party wants to raise the consumption tax to tap the growing ranks of retired people; his Social Democratic coalition allies object.
Other disagreements lurk beneath the surface. Mr Hata's party wants Japan to help put pressure on North Korea to allow nuclear inspections; the Social Democrats, for their part, have a soft spot for the North Koreans. Mr Hata's party would like to increase Japan's military contributions to United Nations peacekeeping; the Social Democrats favour stricter allegiance to Japan's pacifist constitution.
Behind these issues lies a more philosophical division, between defenders of Japan's post-war order and believers in rapid change. Mr Hata's pro-change camp, which includes Mr Hosokawa, wants to scrap the regulations that suited a catch-up economy geared towards exports; Japan is now rich, and its export success has become embarrassing. Likewise, the Hata camp's activist foreign policy reflects the sense that rich Japan must shoulder more responsibility. But conservatives--Liberal Democrats on the right, Social Democrats on the left--feel that Japan has been well served by regulation and pacifism, so should stick to them.
Splinter groups offer variants on this division. On April 18th Shokei Arai, a young Liberal Democrat who had supported Mr Watanabe's bid for the leadership, left the LDP with four friends to set up something called the Liberal Party. Mr Arai says that internationalisation, though good, is causing the Japanese to lose their identity. Mr Arai favours Confucian family values.
Thirty years ago Japanese homes featured shrines to the ancestors; these days, he laments, youngsters are indifferent. Mr Arai proposes to cut Japan's exorbitant inheritance taxes: children should inherit the family wealth, provided they look after parents in their dotage. Schools should concentrate less on academic tests and more on instilling morality, says Mr Arai, voicing popular disgust with cramming.
Economic and foreign-policy reforms, coupled perhaps with cultural conservatism, seem likely to win. Mr Hosokawa has launched a parliamentary group called Reform that may become a full-blown party, comprising his Japan New Party, Mr Hata's Renewalists, the Buddhist-linked Clean Government Party and various defectors. Isamu Ueda, a Clean Government man, says that 90% of his colleagues are ready to bury the Clean Government name and join the Hosokawa group.
The other side is less organised. The LDP used to be held together by the money and patronage that came with power; Yohei Kono, the party leader, is not a man to compensate for these lost glues through force of personality. The Social Democrats are riven by disagreement, and confused by the collapse of the communist regimes with which they used to sympathise. Both parties suffer a steady trickle of defections.
This ferment may yield coherent parties one day, but for the moment Mr Hata--assuming he gets the job--will worry more about everyday government. A budget needs to be pushed through parliament. The Americans, furious about their trade deficit with Japan, need to be placated with measures to boost Japanese demand and so suck in imports. The vast job of deregulation has barely been started.

Ozawa speaks for a short time, and 1 speak for a long time."" Thus Tsutomu Hata, Japan's new (and newly weak) prime minister, describing the man who manipulates his coalition, Ichiro Ozawa. Mr Ozawa matters not just because he is the force behind the earthquake in Japanese politics which began last summer; his unJapanese bluntness is also promoting a revolution in thought and debate in Japan. That intellectual upheaval will, in the long run, have a greater impact on Japan than the current political reshuffles.
Mr Ozawa's direct approach is so much at odds with tradition-steeped Japanese politics that it can be counter-productive. His failure to seek consensus this week was responsible for undermining Mr Hata's chances of holding on to power.
Mr Hata's coalition is divided between the Social Democratic Party (former Socialists) on the one hand and Messrs Hata and Ozawa and their allies on the other. Their disagreements, which helped bring down Morihiro Hosokawa, the previous prime minister, have not been resolved. Keen to strengthen his side of the argument, Mr Ozawa has brought together his Japan Renewal Party with three other parties to form a new voting block, which boasts 130 members to the Social Democrats' 70.
In the manner of its execution, this manoeuvre seems to have been deliberately provocative. The name of the new block, Kaishin, literally means ""innovation"", but it harks back to a seventh-century coup in which an anti-reform regent was slashed to death by impatient modernisers. Worse, Kaishin's creation was announced just after the coalition had united to elect Mr Hata prime minister. Neither the Social Democrats nor, by his own account, the prime minister had expected Mr Ozawa to move so suddenly. The Social Democrats walked out of the coalition, leaving it 54 seats short of a lower-house majority. Mr Hata nevertheless formed a government on April 28th. It is unlikely to last long.
Mr Hata may therefore be forced, reluctantly, into a summer election. His image has suffered from the current mess; the main winners from an early vote are likely to be the opposition Liberal Democrats, whose 38-year grip on power was broken nine months ago. New electoral districts, which will weaken them, are due to be drawn up by the autumn. A summer vote, held under the old rules, might return the Liberal Democrats to government.
For the time being, therefore, Mr Ozawa seems to have overdone his bluntness. Kaishin's formation came ""in an extremely appalling way, which would never be accepted in normal society,"" according to a man-in-the-street interviewed by a Japanese newspaper. The Social Democrats pose as the champions of good manners; by stabbing them in the back, Mr Ozawa has infringed on the ideal of loyalty that Japanese traditionally value.
Yet loyalty alone is losing its appeal: younger Japanese want decisions justified by reasoned argument. Bookshops are filled with best-sellers arguing that Japan must become more like the rational West. It is this vast change that Mr Ozawa stands for (and his own pro-reason, pro-individualism, book, ""Blueprint for a New Japan,"" has sold 600,000 copies).
Japan's old mistrust of reason owes much to its history. In Europe, as the middle ages ended, feudal loyalties gave ground to reason, and Luther declared that the individual's interpretation of the Bible mattered more than allegiance to the Roman Catholic church's teachings. The triumph of reason over inherited ideas spurred scientific advance, and led to the industrial revolution. Rational individualism plus growing wealth laid the foundation for democracy.
Japan's revolutions have come in a different order. Feudalism lived on into the 19th century, when a nationalist clique imported the technologies necessary to modernise industry. The import of democracy and reason were postponed, with the result that Japan is now a mature industrial power, but immature politically--just look at the current mess--and intellectually.
SOUNDINGS WITHOUT FURY
The weakness of reason's hold on the country shows itself in many ways. Schools cram pupils with facts; they do not teach the skills of argument. Unscientific views are widely held: for instance, that Japanese snow and Japanese guts are different from the western sort, making the import of skis and beef impossible. Company decisions emerge after exhaustive soundings have established what the majority feels (not thinks), rather than after somebody has analysed the problem (see box). (Box omitted) However misguided the boss may be, his subordinates still believe they owe him loyalty.
This culture is strong among Mr Ozawa's political enemies. The Liberal Democrats used to stick together because young politicians were loyal to their faction chiefs, and this loyalty overrode policy. Indeed, the Liberal Democrats rarely had any ideas at all, which is why bureaucrats ran the country. It is no coincidence that Mr Ozawa is often criticised for his style, but rarely for his policies.
This creates a strange lopsidedness in Japan's political debates: the opposition does not tend to put up opposing arguments. When the previous prime minister abruptly announced a plan for tax reform, the Social Democrats revolted; they quite understood the need for change, they said, but wanted time to mull it over. When Mr Ozawa calls for deregulation, nobody says that he is wrong, but many wish he would be patient. Japan faces a change easily as big as America's NAFTA or health reform. But the antichange side offers no reasoned line of objection, just vague misgivings.
Similarly, there are many who dislike the new, argumentative style that is transforming debate in Japan. However, since the objectors disapprove of disagreement, they have trouble making their case. Whatever the fate of Mr Ozawa and his allies, in the end his point of view is likely to win.",""" Ozawa is straightforward , and Tsutomu Hata am roundabout .

Big Blue also launched an improved version of its AS/400 mid-range computer as part of an answer to the shrinking of the mainframe market, its traditional focus, and its low margins on personal-computer sales.
Another multimedia deal fell apart. Broderbund Software, a pioneer of ""edutainment"" games, and Electronic Arts, the leading American producer of computer games, called off their proposed $400m merger.
Lufthansa and the German government agreed to settle a dispute over pension rights; the state-owned airline is now cleared for privatisation.
Trustees of two pension schemes controlled by the late Robert Maxwell filed writs against Goldman Sachs, an American investment bank, alleging that it had assisted in the diversion of L55m ($96m) from the schemes. The trustees say the bank did this to ensure that loans it had made to Maxwell companies would be repaid.
BACKDOOR DEALING
Coinciding with news of further falls in the volatile Hong Kong stockmarket, the American Stock Exchange began trading options on its own index of Hong Kong stocks on May 4th--a first for an American securities exchange. The options are partly a substitute for investing in China, since most of the 30 companies on Amex's index have large investments there. The Hong Kong market has fallen by more than 25% since early January.
The World Bank is worried about financial accidents occurring in Asia's developing securities markets. A senior bank official said the lack of basic infrastructure and regulatory structures, as well as the small size of many markets, meant any market failure would have severe consequences. He cited the use of ""high-tech derivatives"" as cause for special concern.
Lloyd's of London plans to strengthen the position of ""names"", who supply the market's capital to underwriting syndicates. Names will get more say in syndicate management, pre-emption rights over capital increases and the right to trade syndicate memberships. Riskier syndicates will also be required to have extra capital. The aim is to give names rights similar to those of shareholders. But it is too late for those who have been ruined by the market's huge losses.
The Bank of England said its new paperless share-settlement system, Crest, would delayed by up to six months, while its cost would be higher than first thought--L35m ($52m), not L20m-L30m. The system will replace the failed Taurus and is due to begin operation in 1996.
CHASTISED
On the eve of a visit to Europe by the new Japanese prime minister, Tsutomu Hata, the European Union's trade commissioner, Sir Leon Brittan, criticised European businessmen for not pursuing exports to Japan as aggressively as American firms. Sir Leon wants to see more cuts in the EU's large trade deficit with Japan.
The Milan public prosecutor won approval from a civil-liberties court to arrest three senior officials of Fininvest, the sprawling business empire owned by the new Italian prime minister, Silvio Berlusconi. The officials, who have challenged the decision in the appeals court, are charged with falsifying accounts. Mr Berlusconi called the prosecutor's move a ""huge mistake"".

Most motorists in the European Union are now green. Last year, for the first time, deliveries of unleaded petrol exceeded those of leaded petrol. From less than 1% in 1986, average unleaded deliveries across the EU were 53% of the total in 1993. But some countries are greener than others, as the chart shows. (Chart omitted)

The prime minister, Tsutomu Hata, is flirting with anyone he thinks might save him from ignominious defeat at the polls. And a gatecrasher from the provinces is trying to put an end to the whole ridiculous fandango.
The main opposition, the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP), is threatening Mr Hata with a motion of no confidence as soon as the country's budget is passed, which will probably be in mid-June. On the face of it, he is likely to lose: he can count on only 178 votes in the 611-seat lower house of the Diet. But the leaders of the SDP, who refused to join his coalition when they were excluded from a new inner-circle group known as Kaishin, are playing a nice-cop-nasty-cop routine with him, with promises of absolution if he confesses the error of his ways.
The routine began with Wataru Kubo, the party's secretary-general, calling for Mr Hata to go. Mr Kubo knows that Kaishin is a vehicle for the ambitions of Mr Hata's colleague Ichiro Ozawa, rather than the prime minister himself. Mr Kubo hinted that, if Mr Hata were to expiate his guilt-by-association with resignation, the SDP would catch him before he hit the ground. It would join a new coalition, possibly with Mr Hata as its leader, and no election would be necessary. A few days later, however, the SDP seemed to be turning elsewhere. Its chairman. Tomiichi Murayama, suggested his party might be ready to co-operate with the LDP, Or at least with elements within it. Even without an election Mr Hata would be history.
In part this is bluff, in part a real difference of opinion. The SDP is split. Mr Kubo represents the reformers who would deregulate the economy, promote indirect taxes over direct ones, and favour an activist foreign policy. Mr Murayama, a creature of the trade unions, tends towards the status quo.
At present it looks as though Mr Kubo is going to have his way. There will be a price, of course: the end of Kaishin and the humiliation of Mr Ozawa. The down-payment has already been made. Keigo Ouchi, the chairman of the Democratic Socialist Party, was made to announce his resignation on June 1st. Though Kaishin was Mr Ozawa's idea, he persuaded Mr Ouchi to accept the honour of announcing its formation. Now that it has failed to shore up Mr Hata, Mr Ouchi is sacrificing himself as penance.
This is bad news for the LDP. It needs an election sooner rather than later. By September the new system of single-member constituencies promised under the new electoral law is expected to be in place. The current system over-represents the countryside and thus favours the LDP.
The party, though, still has weapons with which to attack the government. It seems content to leave the destruction of Kaishin to the SDP. At present it is trying to undermine the other large coalition member, the Clean Government Party, Komeito.
The cleanliness of any Japanese administration is dubious. Since the second world war, three prime ministers have been forced out of office under a cloud of corruption, and one has been sent to prison. On May 31st questions were even asked about the disappearance from the books of a loan by the hitherto spotless Mr Hata to his wife. Komeito's cleanliness, though, is next to godliness. It is prominently backed by Soka Gakkai, a Buddhist group with 17m members.
Too prominently, says Shizuka Kamei, who believes Komeito's activities contravene the legal separation between temple and state. On May 24th Mr Kamei, an LDP member of the budget committee, played what he claimed was a tape of Daisaku Ikeda, Soka Gakkai's leader, crowing about his influence over the cabinet of the previous prime minister, Morihiro Hosokawa.
All this manoeuvring, though, involves the same old names and faces. Yet the man who perhaps poses the greatest threat to Mr Hata's chances of holding the prime ministership for any length of time is not even in the Diet. He is Takahiro Yokomichi, the governor of Hokkaido. Like Mr Hosokawa (the other new face in Japanese politics, who comes from Kyushu, at the other end of the Japanese archipelago), he is a charismatic outsider. Unlike Mr Hosokawa, he inclines to the left, but like him he has ambitions to reform the political system by breaking up the existing parties. He is promoting the formation of the Council for Democratic Government (CDG), a Kaishin of the moderate left with members from a collection of parliamentary groupuscules including parts of the SDP.
The CDG is expected to proclaim itself officially in mid-June. At the moment it is reckoned to have between 50 and 60 existing Diet members--about as many as Mr Hata's group within Kaishin. This, and Mr Yokomichi's reputation as a popular, honest outsider, could make the governor a man of significance. Come the general election, he will be looking for a seat in the Diet.","After six weeks outside government , Japan 's Social Democratic Party ( SDP ) is bored with being a wallflower .

Attendants rush to the arriving car, shouting ""Welcome!"" at the top of their voices; they shine the windscreen and fill the tank while the customer relaxes. Then the bill comes. Japan's petrol costs three times as much as America's, not least because government regulations decree that customers are not permitted to serve themselves at petrol stations.
On June 14th Tsutomu Hata, the prime minister, promised to change the petrol rules as part of his campaign to tame Japan's ferocious prices. The OECD reckons that Japan's consumer prices are 80% above the OECD's average; deregulation that allowed firms to cut costs could go some way to solving this. Lower prices, in turn, would shift money from companies to consumers; higher consumption, and less corporate investment, might go some way to curing Japan's persistent trade surplus. Yet Mr Hata's far-seeing plans involve a short-term risk. Falling prices may hinder the country's economic recovery.
Such gloom is out of fashion in Tokyo. This month the stockmarket has hit a two-year high; and the OECD has raised its forecast for Japan's real growth to 0.8 this year and 2.7% next year. Most economists reckon that the economy grew at an annualised real rate of 2.5-3% in the first three months of this year. The Bank of Japan's quarterly survey of business sentiment, released on June 10th, showed the first improvement since 1989.
After three years of falling growth, this sounds wonderful. But, although the news is certainly less bad, it is not exactly good. Fast first-quarter growth means little; in 1993 the economy also started bravely, but flopped in the summer. The evidence on the second quarter of this year is not all cheerful: industrial production in April was down 1.4% from the previous month; private-sector machinery orders were down 14.2%. Business sentiment may have improved but pessimistic companies still overwhelm optimistic ones in the central bank's survey.
The collapse in machinery orders may prove especially revealing. Investment is down partly because Japanese firms built too many factories during the go-go 1980s; but also because of deflation. When prices fall, the returns from a firm's investment fall too, in nominal terms; meanwhile the nominal value of the debt incurred to pay for the investment has remained constant. Falling revenues plus fixed loan values combine to deter investment; for many firms, paying off bank loans is more sensible than taking out new ones. The value of outstanding loans made by Japan's 11 commercial banks fell 1% in the year to May, the biggest decline on record.
Falling prices also drive firms to cut costs, which explains one other scary statistic. In May 1,194 companies went bust, a small rise on the April figure; for 16 consecutive months, the number of bankruptcies has topped 1,000. The unfortunates are mainly smallish suppliers, pushed under by bigger firms' determination to squeeze the price of inputs. Often this means buying supplies from abroad, since the strong yen has rendered Japanese subcontractors uncompetitive. In short, falling prices oblige Japan to export jobs and growth to other countries.
Mr Hata's official line is that Japan's prices should fall to international levels. This could take years. Wholesale prices fell by just 2.7% in the year to April; consumer prices probably fell by a similar amount, although the official figures (which underplay discounters) suggest that they rose slightly. Whatever the precise speed of the fall, the disincentive to invest caused by deflation could last for half a decade.
With luck, the economy will recover, thanks to government tax cuts, due this month, plus higher consumption made possible by lower prices. By throttling suppliers, however, falling prices may frustrate this. Small, vulnerable firms (roughly, those employing fewer than 300 people) employ four out of five Japanese workers. Fearing for their jobs, those zealous petrol-pump attendants may not be rushing to the shops to spend their way out of recession.","Sheer zeal for work is the first thing the visitor observes in a Japanese petrol station .

The third in three months is Tomiichi Murayama, from the left-wing Social Democratic Party. Bizarrely, he is backed by the conservative Liberal Democratic Party(Lop), though not by the reformist party of the previous prime minister, Tsutomu Hata, which would have preferred Toshiki Kaifu, a member of the LDP. The selection was baffling, even to insiders, but the important results are simple. In the short term Japanese politics will be chaotic. In the medium term democracy may gain.
Mr Murayama is 70. He has no ministerial experience. And he comes from the left of the left. From August 1993 until April, the Social Democrats were part of the reformist government led by Morihiro Hosokawa. That coalition collapsed because Mr Hosokawa's sense of urgency clashed with the Social Democrats' foot-dragging. That is one trait they have in common with their new partners in the LDP and the small New Harbinger Party: both take a cautious view of deploying Japanese troops abroad, and both are happy to delay the economic deregulation that most accept is necessary. But the nay coalition is dogged by old memories. During the cold war the LDP firmly took America's side, while the Socialists (as they were then known) preached leftist neutralism.
Memories have already caused some parliamentarians to revolt. In the final round of the ballot for prime minister on June 29th, 51 members of the Diet defied their party leaders by voting against Mr Murayama. They included some big LDP names: Yasuhiro Nakasone, prime minister from 1982 to 1987; Michio Watanabe, a former foreign minister; and Mr Kaifu, prime minister from 1989 to 1881. Among Social Democrats, eight voted against their own boss, and another three abstained.
More revolts may follow as events test the coalition's unity. It may prove impossible, for example, to avoid speeding up the pace of deregulation. This week the yen rose to new heights against the dollar, threatening Japan's fragile economic recovery. Japan's vast trade surplus lies at the root of the yen's strength. Deregulation should help to shrink it by making it easier for foreign firms to sell in the Japanese market. Accordingly, on June 28th, the outgoing government announced a package of 279 promises to unravel rules and red tape.
The LDP and Social Democrats are likely to argue about how to fudge this inheritance. They may also bicker over tax reform, so provoking a clash with the finance ministry, which is anxious to raise consumption taxes. Meanwhile, North Korea's nuclear programme could provoke fresh pressure for economic sanctions. The LDP would want to co-operate with an attempt to impose sanctions; the Social Democrats would not.
The biggest threat to government cohesion, however, lies in the looming election. New constituencies are due to be drawn up by September; many expect an election a couple of months after that. Having fought each other through the cold war, the rank-and-file from both coalition parties are unlikely to co-operate on the hustings. Unless the election is delayed, their interests in keeping the coalition together will fade.
When it comes to the election, however, the benefits of chaos may start to be felt. For the clearest achievement of the political turmoil that began last year has been to break the LDP'S 38-year hold on government. The worry has been that an election might restore the LDP'S dominance, because the new electoral system does away with the multi-member constituencies that helped to protect smaller parties' voices.
As it is, however, the latest defections from the LDP and the Social Democrats have swollen the ranks of the reformist block. This includes Mr Hata and his predecessor, Mr Hosokawa, who belong to a new reformist grouping, Kaishin. Together with the Buddhist Clean Government Party and two other splinter groups, this block is just about big enough to take the LDP on.
The new divide may also offer voters a clearer choice of policies than they have enjoyed for some time. When the LDP was formed in 1955, its character was clear. It was pro-American, and pro-Japanese business. It was against the Socialists, who stood a chance of being elected. But as the Socialist opposition weakened, along with socialism worldwide, the main policy divisions ceased to coincide with party lines. Instead, they fell within the LDP--so depriving voters of a say over them.
Now parties and policies are matching up again. This week's defectors from the LDP, notably Messrs Nakasone and Watanabe, share Kaishin's more outgoing foreign policy; Kaishin's chief strategist, Ichiro Ozawa, believes Japanese troops should take more part in United Nations peacekeeping, despite Japan's pacifist constitution. Meanwhile the Social Democratic defectors come from the right of the party, which shares Kaishin's appetite for deregulation. The next election should give Japanese a chance to choose between this and the LDP'S conservatism.","As they say in Tokyo these days , Japan has become a karaoke democracy : everybody can have a turn at being prime minister . The third in three months is Tsutomu Hata . Bizarrely , Tsutomu Hata is backed by the conservative Liberal Democratic Party(Lop ) , though not by the reformist party of the previous prime minister , Tsutomu Hata , which would have preferred Toshiki Kaifu , a member of the LDP . The selection was baffling , even to insiders , but the important results are simple . In the short term Japanese politics will be chaotic . In the medium term democracy may gain . Tsutomu Hata is 70 . Tsutomu Hata has no ministerial experience . And Tsutomu Hata comes from the left of the left . From August 1993 until April , the Social Democrats were part of the reformist government led by Morihiro Hosokawa . That coalition collapsed because Mr Hosokawa 's sense of urgency clashed with the Social Democrats ' foot - dragging . That is one trait they have in common with their new partners in the LDP and the small New Harbinger Party : both take a cautious view of deploying Japanese troops abroad , and both are happy to delay the economic deregulation that most accept is necessary . But the nay coalition is dogged by old memories . During the cold war the LDP firmly took America 's side , while the Socialists ( as they were then known ) preached leftist neutralism . 
 Memories have already caused some parliamentarians to revolt . In the final round of the ballot for prime minister on June 29th , 51 members of the Diet defied their party leaders by voting against Tsutomu Hata .

With a little 3 luck (and much to the relief of journalists who have to remember all their names), Japan's numerous opposition parties are about to follow Thoreau's maxim and merge themselves into something they hope will look as though it could run the country. On September 5th their leaders are due to have a pow-wow to discuss how deep this merger should be: merely a voting alliance in the Diet, or an arrangement that reaches down to the grass roots. And what, if anything, they should believe in.
The merger of the eight parties (only the Communists are not invited), if it comes about, will be the brainchild of Ichiro Ozawa, the eminence rise of the reform movement in Japan. That there are so many opposition groups is largely Mr Ozawa's fault. He has worked assiduously to split open Japan's traditional political parties and winkle out those politicians he believes sympathetic to his causes-economic reform at home and a ""normal"" foreign policy. Now he must show himself a builder as well as a destroyer.
On the face of it, this should be easy. The argument for merger looks unanswerable. Without it, coherent opposition to the government, dominated by the Liberal Democratic Party, is impossible. With it, the opposition might even be able to turn enough coats in the governing coalition to take power without an election. And, if that election comes, unity will be needed to stop the opposition parties destroying each other in the reformed, first-past-the-post, electoral system.
The main obstacle to union may be Mr Ozawa himself. All the opposition parties distrust each other to a certain extent, and there is much jockeying for position in the constituencies over which candidates will stand down in favour of whom. But everybody distrusts Mr Ozawa, even though they support, with varying degrees of conviction, his ideas. Even his own group, the Japan Renewal Party, has reason to be wary. His previous attempt to arrange a reformers' union cost its leader, Tsutomu Hata, his job as prime minister. The attempted merger so incensed the Social Democratic Party that it left in a huff and formed a coalition with the Liberal Democrats.
So Mr Ozawa may find that he has to stoop to conquer. He may leave the incipient party's starring roles to a triumvirate of ex-prime ministers: Mr Hata, his predecessor, Morihiro Hosokawa, and Toshiki Kaifu, who recently fled the Liberal Democrats to form the poetically named High Ideal Party. Mr Ozawa may also have to back-pedal on some of his more radical ideas, such as a permanent seat for Japan on the United Nations Security Council.
Even a united opposition would be around so seats short of a majority in the Diet. But a row within the Liberal Democrats or the Social Democrats (either or both of which is entirely possible) could provoke enough backbenchers to change sides.
At the moment, the Social Democrats look the more vulnerable. On September 3rd, the party--whose leader, Tomiichi Murayama, is currently prime minister--will hold its national convention. This ought to be an occasion for triumph. In fact, it will be more like a decorators' convention, papering over cracks. Though there will almost certainly be a public show of unity, the party is split. Its reformers are unhappy about supporting the Liberal Democrats and its left-wing traditionalists do not want to make policy compromises with the Liberal Democrats. As many as 30 of its 74 representatives in the Diet's lower house look as though they would be prepared to jump ship into a new reformist party if the terms were right. Not quite enough to break the government, perhaps, but enough to make it think.","Simplify , simplify .

To a hum of seafaring cliches--catching the tide, striking out for new horizons, waves of the future--Shinshinto, Japan's latest political party, slid majestically down the slipway on December 10th. And carried on sliding. In local elections held the next day, it was humiliated. An opinion poll published a few days later put its nationwide support at a miserable 15%. If this, as its creators claim, is to be the next government of Japan, something is missing.
Shinshinto is the brainchild of Ichiro Ozawa, widely regarded as Japan's most powerful opposition leader. In 1993 he defected from the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP), for years the sole ruler of Japan and now the main component of the governing coalition, and encouraged many others to follow. Now he has persuaded most of those defectors to band together and to create, together with several long-established parties, an outfit that has almost as many members in the Diet as the LDP itself (178 in the lower house, to the LDP's 260).
Shinshinto, however, has been born with an identity crisis. The common denominator of the nine groups of which it is composed is not so much their ideological sympathy with Mr Ozawa's declared policies of reform as their exclusion from power. The party's disparate limbs are already falling off. Ten Diet members who said they would join declined at the last moment, and two who did join have already left.
Even the party's name was a matter of controversy. A literal translation into English is ""new new party"", but this was thought to be a bit naff. So, after an intense debate, it was decided that the ""official"" English name should be New Frontier Party, with much knowing explanation about the subtle differences in meaning between the first shin and the second.
There was also confusion about who would lead the party. Mr Ozawa, who has always preferred to exercise power from behind, clearly would not. Instead, he became its secretary-general. But it was unclear whether the honour of being chairman would fall to Tsutomu Hata, an old crony of Mr Ozawa's who was briefly prime minister in the summer, or Toshiki Kaifu, another crony who was prime minister three years ago. In the end, to everybody's surprise, there was an election which Mr Kaifu won.
Mr Kaifu, though amiable and, by Japanese political standards, a man regarded as clean, is reckoned a bit lightweight. His new role has been compared to that of a mikoshi, one of the ceremonial floats carried around during festivals--all show and the lighter the better. This clearly suits Mr Ozawa, who lobbied hard on his behalf.
What this has done to the friendship between Mr Ozawa and Mr Hata is uncertain. Since they have been buddies for a long time, some conspiracy theorists suggest that Mr Hata acquiesced in his own defeat--so that the chairmanship (and with it the prime ministership) could eventually be offered to a new defector from the governing coalition who might deliver enough of his colleagues to bring the government down.
Which is, after all, the point of the exercise. Because if no new defectors turn up, the party might be obliged to fight a general election. And that, if the past few days are a guide, would leave Mr Ozawa trying to work out how to create a Shinshinshinto.","BEETHOVEN at his most rousing ( ninth symphony , last movement ) was played .

After ten years, Jacques Delors was set to retire from the presidency of the European Commission, giving way to Jacques Santer, everyone's second-choice replacement. He also decided not to stand for the French presidency. Three new countries voted to join the European Union: Austria, Finland and Sweden. Norway's voters rejected their government's application (for the second time in 22 years). The EU agreed on a ""pre-accession"" strategy for six East European applicants.
There were Euopean elections galore. Helmut Kohl won a fourth term in Germany. Silvio Berlusconi's right-wing coalition won in Italy but fell victim to bickering. The left returned to power in Sweden and held on in Denmark. In Holland and Slovakia inconclusive polls produced coalitions of left and right. Ex-communists swept back in Hungary, Bulgaria and Ukraine, where President Leonid Kuchma launched radical reforms.
In Bosnia, NATO imposed a heavy-weapons exclusion zone around Sarajevo after threatening its first-ever offensive military operation. Nonetheless, splits opened in the alliance over criticism that NATO and the UN had done little to protect the Bosnian Muslims. Serbia's president, Slobodan Milosevic, squeezed the Bosnian Serbs to persuade them, he said, to accept an international peace plan.
Boris Yeltsin warned NATO that its expansion in Eastern Europe could bring a ""cold peace"". Mr Yeltsin sent troops to crush an attempt by Chechnya to secede. He withdrew almost all Russian troops from the Baltic states.
After 25 years of violence, the Irish Republican Army declared a ceasefire, opening the way for Sinn Fein, its political wing, to hold peace talks.

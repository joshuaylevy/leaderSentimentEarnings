FOR seven and a half years, Austria's chancellor, Werner Faymann, survived the fall-out of the world financial crisis, turmoil in the euro zone, a wave of refugees and more than a dozen electoral setbacks for his Social Democratic party. As of last week, he was the European Union's second-longest-serving head of government, after Germany's Angela Merkel. 
But the first round of Austria's presidential elections last month, where his party's candidate won a dismal 11% of the vote, was one defeat too many. At the traditional May Day parade, party stalwarts turned away and young activists booed him. On May 9th Mr Faymann stepped down. A politician better at infighting than public speaking, he leaves behind a divided party and a precarious government. 
The coalition, with the centre-right People's Party as junior partners, enjoys a slim majority in parliament. But it is under attack from the far-right Freedom Party, which is well ahead in the opinion polls. Norbert Hofer, its soft-spoken candidate for the federal presidency, got 35% in the first round and is the favourite to win the run-off on May 22nd. The position is mostly ceremonial, but can exercise real power in uncertain times. Mr Hofer has threatened to try to block EU trade agreements, and to dismiss parliament if it raises taxes or relaxes immigration barriers. 
The Freedom Party has been riding a wave of discontent with both governing parties, which have been ruling jointly or in alternation since 1945. It got its biggest boost last year, when about 1m migrants from the Middle East came through the country. Though most moved on to Germany and Sweden, 90,000 people applied for asylum in Austria last year, a large number for a nation of 8m citizens. 
Mr Faymann at first stood by Mrs Merkel in her determination to keep the doors open for refugees. But under pressure from public opinion and his coalition partner, he agreed in January to erect border controls and cap the number of asylum-seekers allowed in, triggering a wave of border closures through the Balkans. The volte-face split the party: left-wingers accused Mr Faymann of kissing up to the Freedom Party, while centrists said the party should start to cooperate with the far right. 
This rift puts Mr Faymann's successor in a tricky position. The most likely candidate is Christian Kern, the boss of the state-owned railway company, who has strong roots in the party but no experience of day-to-day politics. He will be more willing to undertake business-friendly economic reforms than Mr Faymann was, says Thomas Hofer, a political analyst, ""but it will be a hard sell within the party."" 
The refugee policy, however, is unlikely to change. The People's Party says it will remain in the coalition only if the borders remain shut for most asylum-seekers. Reinhold Mitterlehner, the party leader, is under pressure because of poor polls and must compete for popularity with Sebastian Kurz, the foreign minister, a charismatic 29-year-old who takes hard-line positions on immigration. Both parties will want to avoid snap elections before their term ends in 2018. 
A victory for the far-right presidential candidate may, paradoxically, boost the fortunes of the coalition, says Mr Hofer. It would bring its parties closer together, fearing a far-right power grab. Neither Social Democrats nor conservatives will want to play junior partner to a populist Freedom Party and its rabble-rousing leader, Heinz-Christian Strache. Thanks to a lack of good alternatives, the old coalition could live on, warts and all.

WHAT is Austria's problem? In Vienna the streets are clean, the trams rattle reliably past and the bow-tied waiters still dispense their Sachertorte with supercilious smirks. The country is well-run, prosperous and secure. There are no neglected banlieues. Even the refugees who poured through last year have stopped coming. And yet Austria is on the verge of electing a far-right president from a party with an unsavoury past. 
Last month, for the first time in post-war Austria, voters in the first round of a presidential election spurned the candidates backed by the centre-left Social Democrats (SPO) and centre-right People's Party (OVP), which run the country in a ""grand coalition"". In Sunday's run-off they must choose between Norbert Hofer, the fresh-faced candidate of the far-right Freedom Party (FPO), or Alexander Van der Bellen, an aged professor backed by the Greens. Mr Hofer is the favourite, and the rest of Europe is alarmed. 
The FPO operates from a familiar populist-right playbook. The suits have grown sharper while the outright racism has been cloaked. The hostility has shifted from Jews to Muslims, a strategy that resonates with voters of Serbian background, whom the party has assiduously cultivated. Its leaders prefer social media to the traditional kind. Its base is poorly educated rural men. It has no good words for America but plenty for Vladimir Putin. 
If he wins, Mr Hofer is unlikely to wreak constitutional havoc. But should Heinz-Christian Strache, the FPO's chairman, become chancellor at the next federal election (due in September 2018, if not sooner), some fear a Hungarian-style attack on independent institutions. Others worry about squabbles with neighbours; Mr Strache has mused that the German-speakers of South Tyrol, across the Italian border, might like to rejoin their Austrian brethren. What do voters see in this outfit? 
For decades Austria was a living example of the old saw that there is no point in voting because the government always gets in. The Second Republic, established after the war, has been run almost without interruption by either, or (usually) both, the SPO and the OVP. Under Austria's Proporz system, jobs, housing and business licences were doled out on the basis of party membership. Laws are written by party-affiliated labour or business groups and handed to parliament to rubber-stamp. Even now two motoring associations and two mountain-trekking clubs exist, to ensure that Austrians need never dally with another political tribe when their cars break down or when on an Alpine stroll. 
This arrangement worked when growth was high and jobs plentiful. But when the system faltered, cronyism made an easy target for genuine opposition parties. Austria, which never went through a thorough German-style post-Nazi reckoning, was not inoculated against a xenophobic party like the FPO. The party chugged along for years as a political also-ran, until hostility to the clubbiness of Austrian politics lifted it into the major league. 
The FPO became a serious force in the late 1980s under a charismatic leader, Jorg Haider, who was not averse to praising Nazi Germany. In 1999 it won 27% of the vote and joined an OVP-led coalition. (Austria's horrified EU partners briefly cut diplomatic links.) But after a flurry of early reforms the government turned out to be no less wedded to the methods of patronage than its predecessors. The extent of the corruption the FPO practised while in office is only now emerging. 
The party split, and for a while sank. Mr Haider died in a car crash in 2008. But last year's refugee crisis revived it. Austria's hapless social-democrat chancellor, Werner Faymann, initially supported Germany's open-door policy before pirouetting gracelessly towards border closures and asylum quotas, as the FPO had advocated from the start. The grand coalition fed the discontent with aimless rows. The FPO has now topped polls for over a year. On May 9th, under pressure from his disgruntled party, Mr Faymann abruptly resigned. 
After being sworn in this week his successor, Christian Kern, admitted that the grand coalition was losing voters' trust. His speech also revealed the constraints on the government. Mr Kern backed Mr Van der Bellen for president but was unable to offer the SVO's formal support, because many of its members hope to join the FPO in coalition. The OVP feels the same. The government now has its last chance to show that it has not run out of ideas. There is plenty to do, from schools reform to slashing red tape to constitutional changes. Some 90,000 asylum-seekers need integrating. ""The OVP, and in particular the SPO, thought reforms would lose them elections,"" says Franz Schellhorn, director of Agenda Austria, a think-tank. ""Now the opposite is true."" 
The best lack all conviction 
The centre is struggling to hold all over Europe. In Austria the mainstream parties did their best to turn politics into dull mush, yet it has suddenly turned hard and consequential. The SVO and OVP, having brought rising living standards and preserved social peace for decades, are visibly out of ideas. Many Austrians cannot take apocalyptic talk of the FPO's rise seriously. In France voters unite behind candidates they dislike to block the far-right National Front. But Mr Van der Bellen can rely on no such coalition to propel him to the presidency. For voters of a conservative bent Mr Hofer may actually represent the safer option. 
So in many respects this is an Austrian story as much as a European one. But these days every European election carries a larger meaning. Far-right parties across Europe will cheer a victory for Mr Hofer on Sunday; liberals will lament it. Austria is not about to return to the 1930s. But the election of Western Europe's first far-right head of state would still mark a solemn moment. Austria's do-nothing coalition is on the front line of a struggle that many other centrist parties across Europe are facing. Some appear to have given up. This is Austria's problem. But it is also Europe's.","One of Europe 's most steadfastly dull countries has suddenly turned interesting

AUSTRIA'S far-right Freedom Party (FPO) is finding it hard to come to terms with defeat. On December 4th its candidate, Norbert Hofer, lost to Alexander van der Bellen (pictured), an ex-leader of the Green party, in a rerun of the country's presidential election. Two days later the FPO's leader, Heinz-Christian Strache, blamed the loss on ""overwhelming media power"", which painted Mr Hofer as ""the devil incarnate"". On social media, Mr Hofer's supporters alleged massive voter fraud. 
Their disappointment was understandable. Mr Hofer drew a respectable 46.7% of the votes, but he had expected to win, after falling just 31,000 votes short in the initial election in May. (That vote was annulled by the country's constitutional court because of irregularities.) Instead, Mr Van der Bellen's lead grew. Every other big party, as well as business leaders, artists, intellectuals and the mainstream media rallied behind him, hoping to avoid the embarrassment of being the first country in Western Europe to elect a far-right head of state since the second world war. The result suggested that most Austrians remain committed to European integration, the main theme of Mr Van der Bellen's campaign. 
The demography of the vote resembled that of the Brexit ballot in Britain and Donald Trump's election in America (see chart). The populist Mr Hofer won majorities among men, those with less education and residents of rural areas. Women, those with higher education and city-dwellers backed Mr Van der Bellen. 
The outcome is welcome news for Austria's embattled coalition of Social Democrats and the conservative People's Party, which had shown signs of falling apart. A day after the election the Social Democratic chancellor, Christian Kern, and Reinhold Mitterlehner, the People's Party chief, vowed to stick it out until the end of the parliamentary term in 2018. Austria's federal presidency is a mostly ceremonial post, but Mr Hofer could have used the office to put pressure on the government to step down. Poll after poll shows the FPO ahead of the two governing parties. But Mr Van der Bellen has said repeatedly that he would not appoint Mr Strache as chancellor, even if the FPO finishes first, because of its anti-European views. 
Before the run-off, several senior officials in the People's Party defied Mr Mitterlehner by openly supporting Mr Hofer, a possible step toward forming a coalition with the FPO. The two parties governed together in the 2000s, when the FPO was led by Jorg Haider, a charismatic rabble-rouser. That government faced massive protests, and was briefly shunned by other European states. But with the rise of far-right parties in other European countries, a government that included the FPO would probably not face such ostracism. Even some regional Social Democratic leaders are calling for an end to the decade-old policy of ruling out coalitions with the FPO. This only forces the party into a permanent grand coalition with the People's Party, they say, feeding voters' frustration and strengthening the populists. 
If elections were held today, polls show that the coalition would fall short of a majority in parliament, giving Mr Strache a chance to become chancellor. But thanks to Mr Hofer's defeat, the government has gained some time to improve its dismal popularity rating. The refugee crisis that began in 2015, in which Austria received over 100,000 asylum-seekers from Syria, Afghanistan and Iraq, stoked anti-Muslim sentiment and boosted the FPO. A mediocre economy has also hurt the government. GDP grew by less than 1% a year in 2014 and 2015, though it has picked up since. Unemployment was at 5.9% in October, a high rate for Austria, though few other European countries would complain. 
Most damaging to the government are the constant disputes between the two parties. If Mr Kern and Mr Mitterlehner cannot turn things around, the FPO will quickly recover from the latest setback. If it wins the next general election, even Mr Van der Bellen may not be able to stop Mr Strache. In the rise of Europe's populist parties, Austria was once far ahead of the pack. It has fallen behind, but may not stay there for long.

This vast municipal housing complex in Vienna is still riddled with bullet holes--not from fighting between Russians and Germans in 1945, but from a little-known civil war in 1934, when Austrian leftists and conservatives took up arms against each other. After the second world war, the country adopted a political system designed to prevent this from ever happening again: the Social Democrats (SPO) and the Christian Democrats (OVP) would rule together and divvy up public offices under a system known as Proporz. 
For 43 of the past 72 years the two parties have run Austria jointly, in grand coalitions. Their networks politicise everything from school boards and business groups to social clubs and unions. The result is a uniquely corporatist country. 
Today, however, that system is breaking up. Other parties--first the far-right FPO, then the Greens, then the liberal NEOS--have challenged the old duopoly. Both the SPO and the OVP have lost members. Economic stress adds to the pressure. A decade ago Austrian unemployment was a little over half that of Germany; now it is 50% higher. On May 10th Reinhold Mitterlehner, the OVP vice-chancellor, resigned and brought down the dysfunctional SPO-led grand coalition. Elections will take place on October 15th. ""What is happening in this country?"" marvelled Profil, a news magazine: ""Austria is unrecognisable, and redefining itself breathtakingly fast."" 
At the heart of the drama is Sebastian Kurz, Austria's 30-year-old foreign minister, its most popular politician and the OVP's new candidate for chancellor. In one sense, he is a product of the old-fashioned associational system, having soared through his party's ranks as head of its youth organisation. He turned the youth wing from a stagnant backwater into a dynamic network of local groups, putting on parties, pub nights, bike rides and various other opportunities for teenagers and 20-somethings to get it on with one another. In 2013 his youthful, liberal base, centred on Vienna, propelled him to the post of foreign minister. He then won over the party's right-wingers by taking a tough stance on immigration. 
Yet Mr Kurz is also determined to break Austria's old political architecture. He accepted his party's crown only after its bosses had agreed to several demands. These include the freedom to transform the OVP into a list of candidates, pick names for that list, bypass its powerful state bosses and formal interest groups (known as Bunde) and set its policies. Having soared in the polls (see chart), he is now trying to persuade prominent figures in NEOS, the Greens and civil society to join his list. Though his manifesto is a closely-guarded secret, insiders hint at liberalisations of Austria's schools, labour market and transfer payments. ""Taking money in taxes and paying it straight back in subsidies is wrong,"" Mr Kurz argues. 
Christian Kern, the SPO leader and current chancellor, is more defensive of the old model: ""It made Austria strong"", he says. He suggests that Mr Kurz is more image than substance, and doubts whether he can escape the old OVP structures. But like his rival, Mr Kern is a businesslike type who reckons Austria's paternalist model is dying. ""In the past it ran from cradle to grave: you would spend your free time in the Alpine club, at work you would be a member of an SPO or OVP trade union, from the nurseries to the emergency services everything was parcelled up. These connections have dissolved dramatically."" Mr Kern's response is what he calls Plan A, a package of liberalising economic reforms and infrastructure investments. 
Will Mr Kern or Mr Kurz succeed in remaking the system? Critics accuse the former of being a game-player whose grand plans amount to little. And they accuse the latter of merely rebranding the OVP. (Important tests include whether he omits unimpressive OVP placeholders from his list, whether he can persuade his party to support gay marriage and whether he can stand up to the teachers' Bund in support of education reform.) Of the two, Mr Kurz is the most ambitious. 
But the real barrier will probably be that of coalition formation. Messrs Kurz and Stern may agree, largely, on what is wrong with Austria, but after ten years of grand coalition their parties hate each other. Both would like to form a government with NEOS and the Greens, but the numbers look unpromising. That leaves the FPO, with which both the OVP and SPO govern at state level and with which both are willing to form a federal government in October, well aware of the diplomatic opprobrium this would attract. 
Both of Austria's prospective leaders accept that the country's political system is breaking up. The problem is that, unless polls shift, whoever wins will probably be saddled with a government too weak to allow a thorough programme of reforms. Austrian society is evolving. But whether its politics can keep up is uncertain.

LIKE vinyl records and popped collars, rows between the United States and Europe over Russian energy are making a comeback. In the early 1980s Ronald Reagan's attempts to thwart a Soviet pipeline that would bring Siberian gas to Europe irritated the West Germans and drove the French to proclaim the end of the transatlantic alliance. The cast of characters has shifted a little today, but many of the arguments are the same. In Nord Stream 2 (NS2), a proposed Russian gas pipeline, Germany sees a respectable project that will cut energy costs and lock in secure supplies. American politicians (and the ex-communist countries of eastern Europe) detect a Kremlin plot to deepen Europe's addiction to cheap Russian gas. They decry German spinelessness. 
NS2, which its backers hope will come online at the end of 2019, would supply gas directly from Russia's Baltic coast to the German port of Greifswald, doubling the capacity of Nord Stream 1, an existing line. Its defenders, including a consortium of five European firms that will cover half its cost of EUR 9.5bn ($10.6bn), say that it will help plug a projected gap between Europe's stable demand for gas and declining production in the Netherlands and North Sea. Germany's government, especially the Social Democratic Party (SPD), the junior coalition partner, shares this view. (Gerhard Schroder, a former SPD chancellor of Germany, chairs NS2's board.) Some Germans quietly hope that NS2 could transform their country into a European energy hub. 
Such arguments strike sceptics--countries like Poland and the Baltic states, energy experts at the European Commission, foreign-policy hawks and a handful of German renegades--as myopic. NS2, they say, might lower fees for Germans but raises them for eastern Europeans further down the chain. It undermines the European Union's stated aim to diversify its sources of energy (Russia accounts for 34% of the EU's overall gas market, but far more in some countries). It allows Gazprom, the Kremlin-backed energy giant, to bypass existing pipelines in Ukraine, depriving the Ukrainians of lucrative transit fees. By squeezing existing supply routes, NS2 might also leave Ukraine obliged to negotiate cap-in-hand with its arch-enemy (Kiev has not imported gas directly from Gazprom since 2015). Gazprom has proved willing to wage energy wars before. Why contribute to its arsenal? 
To this fiery brew has now been added America's toxic Russia politics. Earlier this month the Senate passed a bipartisan bill that would, among other things, allow the Treasury to slap sanctions on foreign companies that invest in Russian pipelines. (The bill is not yet law: it awaits debate in the House of Representatives, and Donald Trump has yet to opine on its merits.) The move spooked Europe's firms and enraged some of its politicians. ""Europe's energy supply is Europe's business, not that of the United States of America,"" thundered Germany's foreign minister, Sigmar Gabriel, and Austria's chancellor, Christian Kern, in a joint statement. The pair were particularly incensed that the bill included a call to increase American exports of liquefied natural gas, implying that blocking Russian gas was partly an effort to help American energy companies. Angela Merkel, Germany's chancellor, let it be known that she supported her minister. 
The timing of the Senate bill is awful. On June 26th the EU's 28 governments will begin debating whether to allow the European Commission to negotiate the terms of NS2 directly with Russia. Mrs Merkel argues that EU institutions have no business intruding in a purely commercial enterprise. But countries like Sweden and Denmark, which must grant environmental permits if the project is to proceed, want the commission to get involved so that they are not left alone to stare down the Kremlin. Foes of NS2, like Poland, think bringing in the commission might be a way to slow the project down. The discussion will be a fascinating test of Germany's ability to sway opinion inside the European club. 
Don't look back to Angie 
For observers who see Mrs Merkel as Vladimir Putin's main European adversary, her stance is perhaps the biggest puzzle. The chancellor helps broker negotiations between Russia and Ukraine. Against domestic and foreign opposition, she has held the line on the EU's sanctions against Russia over its land grabs. Her strategy looked like a textbook case of European leadership, placing German interests to one side for the greater cause of EU unity and resistance to outside aggressors. 
But the chancellor's tacit yet clear support for NS2 suggests that a correction may be in order. Her commitment to Ukraine is not in doubt, and she is infuriated by Mr Putin's lies. But Germany has never accepted the mantle of European or global leadership that so many would like to thrust upon it, especially when it comes to the politics of energy. Outsiders should not be surprised to see it behave like any other European country favouring its own consumers and firms (two of the five companies investing in NS2 are German). American intervention may only strengthen Germany's resolve to protect its commercial interests. 
Those hoping to slow NS2 would do better to look to Brussels. The commission will be happy to smother the pipeline in bureaucracy, should the EU's governments give it a chance. Its legal brains say that EU energy law does not apply to offshore pipelines outside the internal market. But the commission dislikes NS2 and distrusts Gazprom, which it thinks abuses market dominance. ""If Gazprom was Statoil [Norway's national energy firm], we wouldn't have a problem,"" says one official. 
So NS2 may yet be asked to obey parts of EU law, including third-party access to the pipeline and transparency on pricing. Ukrainian anxieties might be allayed by insisting that Gazprom commit to maintaining supply through existing pipelines after 2019, when the current contract expires. This might ease fears that NS2 will leave parts of Europe in hock to the Russians for decades to come. But before then a thousand things can go wrong.","A proposed Russian - German gas deal smells funny to America

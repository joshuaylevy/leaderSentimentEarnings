JUST when Ryutaro Hashimoto's popularity was expected to pick up, it has plunged even further. The record 16.6 trillion ($127 billion) fiscal package that he announced on April 24th was supposed to get the economy moving and show an anxious public that the Japanese prime minister at last had matters firmly under control. Instead of Japan sliding into its worst recession since the second world war, Mr Hashimoto's tax cuts and public-spending plans would help the economy grow by 2% or so this year. A grateful electorate would then hand his Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) the majority it seeks in the upper-house election on July 12th. After that, Mr Hashimoto would be left in peace until September 1999, when his second two-year term in office expires. 
Unfortunately, no one seems to have read the prime minister's script. After a brief flurry of interest on the day the rescue package was announced, the stockmarket headed down once more-implying that it had seen the future and was not impressed. The voters likewise have been unmoved. In opinion polls taken after the announcement, Mr Hashimoto's approval rating has fallen still further. In the latest survey, only 23% of those interviewed approved of the prime ministers performance, while 50% held him personally responsible for the economic fiasco that is gripping Japan. Mr Hashimoto now seems well into the crisis zone that caused Tomiichi Murayama, the previous prime minister, to resign in December 1995. 
Of the three main reasons that explain why Mr Hashimoto has been able to remain in office, two no longer exist and one may not do so for much longer. First, the divisions within the opposition are at last being patched over. The Democratic Party, formed 18 months ago by Yukio Hatoyama and Naoto Kan, swallowed up three more smaller parties on April 27th. The centrist party under Mr Kan's unexpectedly sure grip now has 93 members in the soo-seat lower house and 38 in the 256-seat upper house (half of whom will come up for reelection in July). 
As the largest opposition group in the Diet (parliament), Mr Kan and his colleagues have been trying to persuade the other opposition parties-including Ichiro Ozawa's dwindling New Frontier Party, the small but influential New Peace Party and even the Communists-to throw their weight behind an effort to topple the government. For the first time in ages, there is talk of a no-confidence motion being mounted by a united opposition. At the moment, it is just talk. Between them, the opposition parties still cannot muster enough votes in the lower house-unless, of course, some dissenters from the LDP were to vote with them. 
There lies the second reason for Mr Hashimoto's new precariousness. In the present economic circumstances, several of the prime minister's critics from within his own party might well cross the floor-or, worse, mount a palace revolution to wrest away the party leadership. The right-wingers within the LDP-who have long wanted to form an alliance with ultra-conservatives from the New Frontier Party and welcome the belligerent Mr Ozawa back into the fold-have been outsmarted by Mr Hashimoto's henchmen. Meanwhile, the LDP has maintained a semblance of unity because the party elders have deemed that there is no serious alternative to Mr Hashimoto for the time being. 
Nevertheless, names are being mentioned. The ruling party's 20- odd prominent right-wingers have dropped calls to replace Mr Hashimoto with one of their own. Instead, they are backing the middle-of-theroad foreign minister, Keizo Obuchi. As the boss of one of the bigger factions within the LDP, the amiable Mr Obuchi is widely seen as a useful compromise candidate for the party presidency-which carries with it the job of prime minister. His main disadvantage is that he represents the businessas-usual brand of LDP politics that does not go down well with the electorate these days. 
More intriguing is the reemergence of Yohei Kono. As party president, Mr Kono could easily have claimed the prime ministership for himself in the coalition government that the LDP formed in 1994 with two minor opposition parties, the Social Democratic Party and the New Party Sakigake. However, Mr Kono stood down in favour of Mr Murayama, the leader then of the Social Democrats, to ensure the coalition's stability. That act of self-sacrifice has earned Mr Kono respect from both the LDP and the public at large. Mr Kono would make a popular leader. 
But, at least in public, Mr Hashimoto is showing no jitters. He was all smiles when Madeleine Albright, the American secretary of state, dropped in this week on her way to Beijing (where she had talks with Chinese leaders about President Clinton's proposed visit in June. Mrs Albright gave her embattled ally a figurative slap on the back, praising Japan for its loyalty and bravery. And, it has to be said, Mr Hashimoto continues to hope for a big enough victory in the upper-house election for the LDP to regain its traditional majority in both houses. 
The possibility of such a victory in July is the third factor that has been protecting the prime minister-and may not do so much longer. Many party stalwarts are convinced that their troubles began when they lost control of the upper house during the Recruit ""shares-for-favours"" scandal in 1989. The crushing defeat by the Social Democratic Party, headed at the time (as it is once more) by Takako Doi, was the LDP'S biggest electoral upset in 34 years. 
But the LDP leaders are now pondering whether Mr Hashimoto will be more of a liability than an asset in the July election. To be able to claim victory, Mr Hashimoto will have to win at least a simple majority (64) of the 126 seats up for grabs. But that would not be enough for the LDP to regain its overall majority in the upper house. To do so, it would need at least 69 seats-a number it has not won in ages. With the economy worsening and unemployment becoming uglier by the month, Mr Kono must be looking a better bet all round. ","Dollars by the billion may not be enough to save the prime minister

Mr Hashimoto has plenty of enemies in the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP),of which he is formally president until September 1999, and he has much to answer for: to wit, having tightened fiscal policy and taxed the country into the ""Hashimoto recession"". But he can count himself lucky. For once the LDP has found itself without its usual back-stabbing band of potential leaders. At present, few probably want his job. 
The electoral reforms of 1994, which made campaigning for the Diet (parliament) cheaper, also weakened the influence of the LDP'S old factional bossesand the role they played in doling out campaign cash and promoting young lieutenants from within. Divided and confused, the LDP is in transition. 
As a result, rising stars are difficult to spot. Among the obvious contenders are Keizo Obuchi, Koichi Kato and,just possibly,Junichiro Koizumi. All three are senior politicians, each with more than nine terms in parliament. The affable Mr Obuchi, 60, is foreign minister and an old-style LDP operator with strong ties to Noboru Takeshita, a former prime minister and nowadays the party don whose approval is needed for everything. With his solid power-base, Mr Obuchi is theoretically the front-runner to take over when Mr Hashimoto stands down. But he has not improved his prospects by letting Mr Kato grab the limelight. 
As the party's secretary-general, Mr Kato, 59, holds a position that gives him great influence over the selection of candidates and the allocation of campaign funds. But Mr Kato, a former diplomat, is not a minister and lacks experience in a heavyweight cabinet job such as foreign affairs or finance. 
Mr Koizumi, 56, is the gadfly health and welfare minister. As the party's selfappointed conscience, he is a maverick with no particular patron within the LDP. But he is regarded as the visionary among the new generation of leaders and is at ease on the international stage. His image as a dashing, passionate politician has won him a big public following, which will not go unnoticed if the LDP's popularity fades. 
Less obvious and less experienced are Kaoru Yosano, 59, a former education minister whose grandmother, Akiko Yosano, was a famous poet; Nobutaka Machimura, 53, the education minister, who was at Tokyo University during a student revolt in the 96os and played a part as a mediator; and Sadakazu Tanigaki, also 53, the minister in charge of science and technology. But none seems to have the stomach for the kind of bare-knuckled fight that is needed to make it to the top. 
The long shots are Kazuyoshi Kaneko and Tadamori Oshima. Mr Kaneko, 55, is a financial whizz-and also a dab hand at tennis; he is respected for his understanding of international affairs. Mr Oshima, 51, has a reputation for coming up with original ideas and is a tough political fighter; he worked for the Mainichi newspaper before entering politics. 
With Japan's economy in such a mess, the LDP could, however, fragment once more. The most likely outcome then would be for the LDP'S right wing to split off and form an alliance with Ichiro Ozawa, who was once a political heavyweight in the ruling party but now leads a dwindling band of conservatives in the opposition. Meanwhile, the rump of the LDP would probably form a coalition with Naoto Kan's Democratic Party of Japan.

SAY what you will about Ryutaro Hashimoto, the outgoing prime minister had a vision of sorts about how to reform Japan and drag its fossilised financial systems and bureaucracy into the next century. True, he misread the economic signals disastrously and taxed the country into its worst recession since the second world war. With no power base inside the ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP), he relied too much on an ineffective civil service demoralised by blunders and shenanigans. Above all, he was guilty of equivocating when action was called for. But for all his faults, Mr Hashimoto was head and shoulders above his probable replacement. 
No one expected the scale of the ruling party's defeat in the election on July 12th for half the 252 seats in the upper house of the Diet (parliament). Flush from recent byelection successes, the LDP faced a handsome victory. Some in the party had begun to think it might regain the overall majority it lost at the height of the Recruit (shares-forfavours) scandal in 1989. Coupled with its majority in the more important lower house, the LDP could then rule without watering down legislation for the sake of its coalition partners. 
The upper house actually has more clout than most people realise, through its ability to block some legislation. Although the LDP has a comfortable majority in the lower house, it has nowhere near the twothirds necessary to overturn an upperhouse veto. So it has relied for the past two and a half years on the help of two small opposition groups, the Social Democratic Party and the New Party Sakigake, to ensure that its bills were never mired in the upper house. All that will now change for the worse, causing serious setbacks for Japan's economic and financial reforms, as well as its foreign relations. 
The surprise about the outcome had its origins in the turnout. At the upper-house election in 1995, the turnout fell to a record low of 44.5% This time, with the voting hours extended and postal-voting restrictions relaxed, the figure was expected to rise. It did-and how. With unseasonably mild weather and nothing much on television, an almost unprecedented 58.8% of Japan's 100m eligible voters cast their ballots, one for the candidate of their choice under the prefectural system and one for the party of their choice under the proportional-representation system. 
According to the exit polls, the additional votes came almost exclusively from the uncommitted (close on 60% of the electorate), especially in the cities. What seems to have stirred people were noisy demands by foreigners for Japan to make recent tax cuts permanent to help revive the moribund economy. Mr Hashimoto had hummed and hawed about this suggestion because of worries over the country's soaring budget deficit, and agreed to it only on the eve of the election. 
The protest votes went almost exclusively to independent candidates in the prefectural poll and to Naoto Kan's Democratic Party of Japan (DPJ) in the proportional-representation part. Overall, independents now account for 25 seats (up from 13) in the upper house and the DPJ for 47 seats (up from 38) Meanwhile, enough of the ruling party's faithful vented their anger by staying at home-causing the LDP to end up with only 103 seats (down from 118). Mr Hashimoto duly fell on his sword in the traditional fashion. 
The front-runner for his job as party president (which, because of the LDP's lower-house majority, also means prime minister) is the pleasant but ineffectual Keizo Obuchi, who has been whiling away his time as foreign minister. Mr Obuchi's sole qualification is that he is the nominal head of the largest faction within the LDP, and it wants its man in the Kantei, the prime minister's residence, so that it can have the plum jobs in the cabinet and party executive. But there are other shadowy forces thrusting Mr Obuchi forward. 
The ""Gang of Four"", which has managed party affairs and set the government's agenda for most of Mr Hashimoto's term, is loth to lose its grip on power. Headed by Koichi Kato, the party's secretary-general, this group includes Hiromu Nonaka, the acting secretary-general, Taku Yamazaki, the party's policy chief, and Yoshiro Mori, chairman of the LDP'S general council. 
With the exception of Mr Nonaka, who is 72, the gang are in their late 50s or early 6os-and anxious to keep their places in line for the leadership. Mr Nonaka, a senior statesman in the Obuchi faction, wields awesome political clout behind the scenes thanks to his close ties with Noboru Takeshita, the faction's former boss and prime minister a decade ago-and nowadays the ""Shogun in the Dark"" whose approval is needed for most things. But whereas none of the other members of the gang owes any allegiance to the Obuchi faction, each is prepared to back Mr Obuchi for other reasons. One is that, having little himself to offer, Mr Obuchi would allow them to wield even greater influence over party and government affairs. The other is that the alternative, as they see it, would be disastrous. 
That alternative is Seiroku Kajiyama, a former chief cabinet secretary and powerbroker within the Obuchi faction. The 72year-old Mr Kajiyama would at least liven things up. Though no expert in finance or economics, he is a rocket scientist compared with Mr Obuchi. But because of his enthusiasm for an alliance with Ichiro Ozawa's right-wing Liberal Party, the LDP barons fear that Mr Kajiyama's appointment could be too divisive. Some fear it would lead to the break-up of the LDP. Mr Kajiyama has the support of his party's old brigade, but he is dreaded by younger members who fear he would cost them their seats. Mr Kajiyama's chances took a turn for the worse on July 15th when the LDP decided that its new leader would be chosen by a secret ballot, rather than the usual behind-the-doors deals. 
The vote means that other candidates are expected to throw their hats into the ring. The health and welfare minister,Junichiro Koizumi, is one. Mr Koizumi has impeccable credentials as a reformist and is a favourite among the party's younger generation. He is also the only weapon the ruling party has for countering the populist Mr Kan, whose DPJ looks like providing the LDP with its biggest challenge. Other names being bandied about include Yohei Kono, who served as the LDP chief, but not prime minister, from 1993 to 1995. A long shot is Sadakazu Tanigaki, the director-general of the science and technology agency. 
With no one candidate having emerged as an obvious replacement for Mr Hashimoto, the vote on July 24th is shaping up to be a classic LDP battle of the generationswith the geriatric right favouring Mr Kajiyama-if he still insists on standing-and the younger members voting with the Gang of Four for Mr Obuchi, unless a reformer such as Mr Koizumi joins the race. Although a general election will have to be held within two years, and may take place as early as next January or February, the betting is that the dull Mr Obuchi will win the party presidency and thus become prime minister-and that the LDP will come to rue the day.

EVEN before Japan's new prime minister is officially anointed in his job in an extraordinary session of the Diet(parliament) on July 30th, expectations are rising. The hope is that action will at last be taken to stir the world's second-largest economy from the coma that it has been slipping in and out of ever since the country's ""bubble"" economy collapsed seven years ago. While the world waits to discover exactly what the new prime minister intends to do, it has become clear that a fundamental change in Japanese political life is now gaining pace. 
Some believe it will not matter all that much who turns out to have won the secret ballot held on July 24th by the ruling Liberal Democratic Party to become the LDP'S new president, and hence prime minister. On the face of it there was little difference between the three candidates who had thrown their hats into the ring: Keizo Obuchi, the polite but bland foreign minister; Seiroku Kajiyama, a former cabinet secretary; and Junichiro Koizumi, the health and welfare minister. 
All three had offered only variations on the same theme-tax cuts, a more relaxed fiscal policy, attempts to boost growth with public spending and a clear-up of the banking mess. The aim, common to all three, had been to prevent the country from sliding into a deflationary spiral, with falling prices and a rapidly shrinking economy (see page 74). Once Japanese consumers start spending again, so the theory goes, not only will Japan's economy start to recover from its worst recession since the second world war, but it will help pull the rest of East Asia out of its troubles too. 
Yet even small variations in policy could make a difference. That is why any indication about what the new prime minister may try will be of so much interest to ministers from the countries where East Asia's economic crisis began. They are gathering in Manila this week for a meeting of the Association of South-East Asian Nations, and on July 27th delegates from Japan, China, Russia and the United States will join them. 
Many of the policies Japan's new prime minister is likely to put in place would lead to higher inflation. Indeed, a bit of inflation could work wonders for the Japanese economy, it is argued. Politically, however, it could backfire badly on the LDP. Voters dealt the party a big defeat at the recent election for the upper house, the less-powerful chamber in the Japanese parliament. This reverse not only brought about the resignation of Ryutaro Hashimoto as prime minister, but also made it painfully clear where the LDP's principal source of support now lies: more than ever before, it is primarily in the countryside and among the older people in Japan's rapidly greying society. Such people are also the main savers, and many-especially the elderly-live on fixed incomes. They would be enraged if their standard of living were made to suffer and their savings reduced in value in order to help foot the bill for the banking industry's follies. 
That thought ties the hands of the new prime minister somewhat, and largely leaves him with tax cuts and other traditional fiscal methods for getting the economy moving again. It is clear, however, that the first thing he will have to do is to shelve Mr Hashimoto's fiscal-reform law. This has already been relaxed once. It puts a cap on government spending by imposing a strict schedule for eliminating the issuing of deficit-covering bonds by 2003. By then, the budget deficit will, with luck, have come down from nearly 7% of GDP to 3%.All three candidates had promised to loosen or even discard this financial corset. 
Japan's opposition parties would happily go along. They would not quibble either with all three LDP candidates' proposals for cutting individual and corporate taxes. After zigzagging all over the place, Mr Hashimoto eventually agreed just days before the disastrous election to make a permanent tax cut-though, over-cautious to the end, he refused to say by how much.The largest opposition party, the Democratic Party of Japan (DPJ) has already called for an annual Y6 trillion ($43 billion) reduction in taxes. The DPJ did well in the upperhouse election, and its leader, Naoto Kan, is surging in popularity. 
For its part, the LDP has pushed through a once-and-for-all v4 trillion cut for this year. But because of the party's hammering in the election, its new leader will have to up the ante considerably. The stickingpoint with the opposition will be over how the individual tax cuts are introduced. Any attempt to reduce the top rate and broaden the tax base, causing richer households to pay less and poorer ones to enter the tax bracket for the first time, will be resisted tooth and nail by the opposition. 
It is now apparent that Japan's new prime minister is set to face a Diet that is a good deal more confrontational. As it is on a roll, Mr Kan's Dr) will pick fights at every opportunity, hoping to force an early general election before it runs out of steam. Meanwhile, Japan's steadily expanding Communist Party, which has developed a strong grass-roots machine, is talking for the first time about co-operating with other opposition parties to put an end to the LDP's long-standing grip on power. 
All of which spells trouble for the LDP's new leader. With the party now much weaker, its bills-especially the enabling legislation needed for its ""total plan"" for restoring the debilitated financial system, as well as the coming budget and proposed tax cuts-are likely to be held hostage in the upper house by an opposition that smells blood. The upper house, for all its relative weakness, can frustrate legislation. 
So the LDP's new man will find that governing Japan is more difficult than it has ever been before. The country is entering an era of dysfunctional politics, with the possibility of one political order passing to another-providing the world with plenty of worries about Japan's politics to add to its more familiar concerns about its economy.

The ballot on Junly 24th for a new LDP leader to relace Ryutaro Hashimoto, who was stepping down after the party's poor showing in the election for the upper house of the Diet (parliament), was, she said, ""a stockclearing garage sale"". The threeway race between Keizo Obuchi, Seiroku Kajuiyama and Junichiro Koizumi was a contest ""between a bonjin [mediocrity], a gunjin [soldier] and a henjin [crackpot]"". In the event, the goodnatured bonjin easily won the stage-managed contest for the party president. 
Mr Obuchi's election as prime minister on July 3oth was then a foregone conclusion, since the LDP has an overall majority in the more powerful lower house of the Diet. But mediocre or not, Mr Obuchi's government will be quite different from its predecessor. 
The first thing to note is that Mr Obuchi won the job of party leader not thanks to the 225 party members who ostensibly voted for him (out of 414 eligible to do so). Rather, he was picked by a party boss who decided it was time to call the shots againand, above all, to get the LDP back to its old way of doing things. He is Noboru Takeshita, a former prime minister who disposes from the shadows. 
Mr Takeshita was the young Mr Obuchi's mentor upon entering the Diet in 1963. Mr Takeshita later gave him his first big break, making him cabinet secretary in 1987. And it was to Mr Obuchi that Mr Takeshita handed his ruthlessly efficient Keiseikai-then, as now, the largest faction within the LDP-after his anointed successor, Ichiro Ozawa, made an abortive bid for power in 1992 and split the faction. 
The outgoing prime minister, Mr Hashimoto, had been a thorn in Mr Takeshita's side. Mr Hashimoto may have been one of Mr Takeshita's factional lieutenants. Yet he had his own way of doing things: he would ignore the party hierarchy, working closely with bureaucrats instead. For Mr Takeshita (who was forced to cut short his own term as prime minister at the height of the Recruit shares-for-favours scandal in 1989), the pliable Mr Obuchi is a far better prospect for the exercise of power. 
Mr Takeshita's hand is apparent in the LDP's new executive line-up. The choice of Yoshiro Mori as the party's new secretarygeneral, together with Yukihiko Ikeda as its policy chief and Takashi Fukaya as chairman of its general council, follows Mr Takeshita's insistence that high jobs should be handed round with regard to seniority and factional strength. 
The same factional politics have governed the way Mr Obuchi has chosen his cabinet. Here, again, it was Mr Takeshita who got another former prime minister, Kiichi Miyazawa, to become finance minister. Mr Miyazawa had the same job in Mr Takeshita's government a decade ago. 
Mr Miyazawa has held 13 cabinet posts over the years, and he is unquestionably the best man for the present job. He worked in the finance ministry before entering the Diet, where he went on to become head of the Economics Planning Agency at the unheard-of age of 42. His efforts to stabilise the world's currency markets in the 198os won him international respect. Even today, Mr Miyazawa's is one of the sharpest minds in politics. He is the only person in the Diet able to get the American treasury secretary, Robert Rubin, on the telephone for a technical discussion in fluent English. But it speaks volumes about the LDP's shortage of financial talent that it has to drag a 78-year-old out of semi-retirement. 
Still, the LDP bigwigs have persuaded Mr Miyazawa to take the job (against, it should be said, his own better judgment) more for his credibility with foreigners than for the ideas he may bring to the table. Both the yen and the Nikkei stockmarket index promptly rose on the first hint that he might become finance minister. However, there is no getting round the fact that Mr Miyazawa will inherit a set of fiscal and financial plans that were hurriedly drafted for Mr Obuchi's election campaign. 
As the ruling party reverts to form after its brief fling with reform, it will set out to bury many of the policies introduced during Mr Hashimoto's reign. Mr Obuchi's blueprint (or, rather, the one handed to him) requires bank failures to be avoided at any cost. Meanwhile, the economy is to be propped up with public works. Mr Hashimoto's deficit-reduction laws are to be frozen, and at least 6 trillion ($43 billion) of permanent tax cuts introduced, along with a further rio trillion in fresh spending. In short, Mr Takeshita, a firm believer in the power of public works, is taking the LDP back to pork-barrel politics. 
Will Mr Obuchi, let alone Mr Miyazawa, go along with that? They may have little choice. Unkindly, the Japanese media have started referring to Mr Obuchi as Mr Takeshita's ""goldfish shit""-a common, if vulgar, phrase used to describe someone who is forced to tag along.

One problem with this is that credit-rating agencies are starting to balk at Japan's dismal finances. If they were to cut its top-notch AAA rating, then borrowing to pep up the economy would become costlier as interest rates rose to reflect the greater risk of default. And higher interest rates are the last thing Japan's indebted government and firms need. 
Having said, in April, that it was unsure whether Japan deserved its AAA rating, Moody's, an American rating agency, announced on July 23rd that it had put the country on negative credit watch, a move that usually results in a downgrade. This week a second agency, Fitch IBCA, released a report asking whether Japan might be another South Korea. No, it concluded, but with some caveats, such as the opacity and sickliness of the banking system. And it noted that Japan's ability to service its overseas debts could deteriorate should the economy continue to contract sharply. 
There are, broadly, two schools of thought about the rating agencies' fears. The first thinks they are unfounded. The government has no direct foreign borrowings. That its finances are in a mess is not really a problem: there are more than enough savings in Japan-which accounts for 60% of the world's net saving-to sort them out. And Japan has $900 billion of overseas assets, making it the world's largest creditor country. These assets could be used as collateral should the country face a liquidity crisis. On this view, the agencies are being overly cautious, perhaps because of the flak they took for being too optimistic about the rest of Asia before its crisis hit. 
Another reason that some think Moody's is off the mark is that countries with the luxury of borrowing in their own currency can, in theory, print enough money to repay those debts, or raise taxes. That is why rating agencies give a higher rating to countries' borrowings in their own currencies than in others. Moody's gives Greece, for example, an Ann rating for its domestic borrowing, but a much lower one for its foreign-currency debt. Yet the agency is considering downgrading not just Japan's foreign-currency debt but its domestic debt too. If it did so, points out Tom Dunn of J.P. Morgan, Japan would have a lower domestic-debt rating than Greece, Portugal or Iceland. 
Yet this school of thought seems a little too sanguine. The opposing school thinks that the rating agencies may have been too slow to downgrade Japan, rather than too quick. Markets have already, to an extent, moved ahead of them. They now value foreign-- currency bonds issued by Italy, for example, more highly than the 3.4 trillion ($24 billion) of foreign-currency bonds issued by Japan's public-sector borrowers, which carry a guarantee from the Japanese government. 
The big question for both foreign-currency and domestic debts is what that guarantee is worth. The answer is: less than it used to be. Gross public-sector debt is already about 100% of GDP and, thanks to heavy government borrowing, growing at a fair lick. And, excluding social security, the general government deficit is likely to be roughly 5.9% of GDP this year-that is large by international standards, though far from the world's biggest. True, net debt -- which includes social-security assets -- looks less alarming, but this number, which has been rising fast, is slippery: what those assets are worth is anyone's guess. Moreover, net debt figures exclude social-security liabilities; and, as Moody's points out, the government has heaps of contingent liabilities-it has, after all, guaranteed a lot of the financial system. 
Unfortunately the tax take has been growing far more slowly than the government's debts. So even though the average interest cost of Japan's debts has fallen, thanks to lower interest rates, debt-service costs eat up half of national tax revenues compared with about 30% in 1990. Annual tax revenues are now less than a tenth of Japan's stock of debt. 
Things are about to get worse-deliberately. The government's Y6 trillion fiscal package will be financed by further borrowing. The new prime minister, Keizo Obuchi, is muttering about still more packages to get the economy moving. Yet economic recovery would not help tax collection much in the short term: two-thirds of Japanese companies lose money, so they will be able to roll over tax credits for some years to come. Worse, if more government borrowing were to raise interest rates, companies would feel the pain. 
If Moody's is right to be worried, then why is Japan able to borrow more cheaply than any government in recorded history? Indeed, long-term interest rates have fallen even as the governments finances have worsened. The answer is, first, that with prices falling, real interest rates are higher than they look. But also that domestic investors have been so risk-averse that they are loth to put their cash anywhere else; nor, with the economy in the dumps, are there many other options. 
That might change, however. The rating agencies now hint at the possibility of capital flight because of the dismal investment returns on offer in Japan. Someone else would buy every yen asset that investors sold to flee, but the result would be a collapsing currency. This prediction of capital flight has been made many times before, most recently when foreign-exchange controls were abolished in April, beginning Japan's deregulatory ""Big Bang"".

TOKYO 
A FORTNIGHT ago, Japan's new prime minister was a source of hope: perhaps, after years of economic mismanagement, the government of Keizo Obuchi would come to grips with the problems that are destabilising economies around the globe. But those hopes have already been dashed. This week, the growing conviction that Mr Obuchi's government may not last all that long sent tremors through stockmarkets and foreign-exchange markets everywhere. 
The volatility may be worldwide, but its trigger lies in Japan. On August lith the Economic Planning Agency belatedly acknowledged that the economy is in a serious condition; after months of describing the economy as ""stagnant"", its latest report to the cabinet used the unaccustomed phrase ""prolonged slump"". On this new indication of weakness, the battered yen hit an eight-year low of 147.64 to the American dollar. A weak Japan and a weaker yen are the worst possible news for the depressed economies of South-East Asia. The biggest worry is that China will devalue its currency, the yuan, setting off another round of devaluations across the region. China's government insists that it will hold the yuan steady. But in black-market trading in Shanghai last week, it fell to 9.2 to the dollar, nearly ii% below its official exchange rate of 8.3. 
An end to Japan's debilitating banking crisis is the essential first step in restoring a semblance of stability. Almost no progress has been made on that front. Last week, the Democratic Party of Japan (DPJ) by far the largest opposition block in the Diet (parliament), served notice that it will not accept the government's plan for a ""bridge bank"" to deal with failed financial institutions. Kansei Nakano, one of DPJ'S top financial experts, dismissed the government's proposals as a ""childish trick"". His colleague, Shoji Motooka, savaged the new finance minister, Kiichi Miyazawa, calling him ""a class-A war criminal"" for having allowed the economy to overheat while serving as finance minister in 1986-88 and then failing to do anything about the consequences while he was prime minister during 199193. Mr Miyazawa apologised profusely and promised to try harder this time. 
The fear of political paralysis has spooked the markets. Without quick passage of the government's six financial reform bills,Japan's economic woes can only get worse. But since the ruling Liberal Democratic Party(LDP) lost its dominance of the upper house of the Diet in an electoral disaster on July 12th, such passage requires opposition approval. With that in doubt, the Nikkei stock index tumbled every working day from Mr Obuchi's arrival until August 13th. Optimists see his government lasting until October. Pessimists think it could survive into the new year. 
The DPJ is likely to do its best to block Mr Obuchi's initiatives and force a lowerhouse election. All the polls show that it would win a landslide victory if a general election were held today. Naoto Kan, the party's popular leader, would like nothing more than to see the jittery financial markets lay waste to Mr Obuchi's ambitions. He could then delay the bridge-bank legislation until a thoroughly beaten and demoralised cabinet collapsed. 
As an old hand at Diet affairs, the 78year-old Mr Miyazawa knows that it is time to compromise. But Mr Kan, along with the leaders of other opposition parties, has stubbornly refused to engage in backroom discussions with the government on financial reforms. If it cannot topple the government, the opposition at least wants to get full credit for solving the country's baddebt problem-by forcing the government to climb down and accept its own proposals in the glare of the television lights. 
On the merits, the DPJ is right: there is no question that its bridge-bank scheme is better than the government's. Mr Miyazawa's carefully devised ""total plan"" is meant to keep Japan's 19 big banks from outright collapse. Instead, failed institutions would be merged into others, in much the same way as the beleaguered Long-Term Credit Bank is being taken over by Sumitomo Trust. Public funds would then be injected into the merged entity so the bad debts could be written off. To make all that possible, the LDP's bridge-bank proposals were deliberately left vague. That way, officials would have room for fudges. 
Friends in need 
This is where the opposition has taken its stand. The DPJ insists that any failed institution which gets a government rescue must sell its shares to the government for*t apiece. The object is to prevent the LDP from shielding its friends from pain by allowing a failed bank's investors to keep their shares. That is what happened two years ago when the government used public funds to liquidate the failed jusen mortgage companies. The DPJ would also reduce the bridge bank's proposed five-year life to three years, to prevent further shenanigans. 
But the real sticking point is likely to lie elsewhere. The DPJ, along with many foreign investors, wants banks' solvency to be judged by stricter criteria. The audits of big banks currently being carried out by the new Financial Supervisory Agency and the Bank of Japan are re-examining all ""Category Two"" loans-those which could become problematic. The regulators have great discretion in requiring banks to account for these loans. The opposition would split Category Two loans into five sub-categories with strict provisioning levels for each. The DPJ would also have the audits published bank by bank, rather than as a set of collective figures. Nor does the opposition share the government's eagerness to allow the receivers of failed banks latitude to dispense new loans to borrowers. 
All of which is good news. It suggests that when a plan is finally approved, Japan's debilitated banking system may be cleaned up far more quickly and thoroughly than Mr Obuchi's government planned. In the short term, that brush with reality will mean more unemployment and more pain, but the economy is likely to recover more rapidly as a result. 
Over the next few months, the political rumblings will continue to shake the financial markets. That may worry investors and governments around the world, but it does not appear to cause much concern to Mr Miyazawa. The finance minister would not be averse to further weakening of the yen, at least so long as the Americans do not object loudly. Besides, he learned the hard way more than a decade ago that intervention in the foreignexchange markets is generally a fruitless exercise. 
At present, the yen is being held up by the hope that the LDP will honour its promise to loosen fiscal constraints and pull Japan' economy out of the dumps with lavish spending. But it is being pulled down by the difference in fundamentals between Japan's depressed economy and America's more exuberant one. Until Japan can show real progress in clearing up its banking mess, and until a slowdown in the American economy becomes apparent, the yen will weaken further. So long as that happens, Asia's financial markets will continue to be on edge. ","Japan 's political paralysis has caused yet another wild week in the financial markets . More such weeks lie ahead

ONCE again, America will be frustrated over japan's inability to get its economy swiftly back on its feet. For reasons that seem to make sense only to the Japanese, the good times still lie agonisingly far ahead. This was not how it seemed to America on September 4th. At a meeting in San Francisco, the Japanese finance minister, Kiichi Miyazawa, promised America's treasury secretary, Robert Rubin, prompt action to stimulate the economy-including nearly 77 trillion ($53 billion) of tax cuts, a further vio trillion of public works and a freezing of Japan's austere deficit-reduction law. But the ""sense of urgency"" that Mr Rubin urged on Mr Miyazawa did not survive the journey home. 
Back in Tokyo even a cut in short-term interest rates, announced on September 9th by the Bank of Japan, was widely seen to reflect fears that politicians would not be able to move quickly enough to revive Japan's increasingly feeble economy. There is little Mr Miyazawa can do while the ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) is pinned down in the Diet (parliament) by a gung-ho opposition. Lacking a majority in the upper house, the LDP can govern only by doing deals with the Democratic Party of Japan (DPJ) and other opposition groups. When Keizo Obuchi became prime minister in late July, there were fears that he would not last until early October, when the current special session of parliament ends. Such worries have subsided slightly since the LDP managed to win one of two recent by-elections. Nevertheless, Mr Obuchi is regarded as no more than a stop-gap with a year at most to leave his mark. The ruling party has to call a general election before October 2ooo and would get slaughtered if it went to the country with the economy still in a mess and a business-as-usual ditherer at the helm. The greybeards at LDP headquarters are certain to dump Mr Obuchi next year in favour of someone with more dash. 
If another financial disaster is added to the country's current banking woes, then Mr Obuchi will not last even that long. Nor might his party. A no-confidence vote in the Diet, triggered by a big financial bankruptcy, and backed by LDP rebels voting with the opposition, could mean a snap election. With the present mood of the electorate, the LDP could kiss goodbye to its modest majority in the Diet's more powerful lower house. 
What keeps the LDP leadership awake at night is the possibility that the teetering Long-Term Credit Bank (LTcB-among the elite of Japan's banks-will collapse completely and precipitate such a crisis. The government has been pushing Sumitomo Trust, another top bank, to take over LTCB. Mr Obuchi has vowed that none of the country's 19 big banks will be allowed to go broke, although some are insolvent. Scare stories have been circulated by the government and the LDP that the failure of any one of them could lead to financial meltdown around the world. 
A rescue plan for LTCB was first mooted five months ago. But the DPJ, the Liberal Party and the Buddhist-affiliated HeiwaKeikaku group insist that no public money should be used to bail out a bankrupt financial institution without a full disclosure of its records and the heads of the managers responsible. The opposition are adamant that, if taxpayers' money is used to prop up a bank and to continue loans to legitimate borrowers, then investors must be made to share the pain. Voters have not forgiven the LDP for protecting its investor friends when the government used 685 billion of public money to liquidate seven failed jusen (housing loan companies) in 1996. This time the ruling party wants to sweeten the LTCB takeover deal with up to Y8oo billion of cash. Once again, LDP friends would be beneficiaries. 
The opposition wants to put a stop to such shenanigans by abolishing last February's financial-stabilisation law. This earmarked 13 trillion of public money to bolster the capital of financial institutions with sound balance-sheets, and a further trillion to cover losses stemming from banks that go belly up. Repealing the law would make it impossible for the government to inject money into the LTCB. The government has started to yield to the opposition's demands. On September 3rd, the three opposition parties unveiled their own package of bills for dealing with bank failures. Over the past week, Mr Miyazawa and his LDP colleagues have been busy rewriting the government's proposals to incorporate many of the opposition's ideas-including the power to nationalise an ailing bank before it collapsed. Investors would be paid onlythe market rate for their shareholdings. 
The government is now running out of legislative time. Flushed with success, the opposition alliance, led by the DPJ'S popular leader, Naoto Kan, is expected to skewer the ruling party at every turn. It is unlikely that Mr Obuchi will be able to offer Bill Clinton speedy action when the two meet in New York on September 22nd. Even if the bank-rescue legislation is beginning to take shape, actual details of the government's latest proposals for stimulating the economy will be nowhere in sight. 
The next embarrassing climbdown for the LDP is likely to be over the 7 trillion worth of tax cuts that Mr Obuchi promised when he took over. The opposition will press the government to come up with real tax cuts instead of merely continuing temporary ones. The government's plans to claw revenue back through increases in premiums for health insurance and pensions will surely come under attack. Then there is the io trillion supplementary budget that Mr Obuchi glibly talked about two months ago. That is beginning to look more like 3.7 trillion of actual spending. With the opposition parties now proposing legislation of their own, agreement on a new fiscal-stimulation package could take the rest of the year. 
While the government fiddles, the Japanese economy worsens. On September 8th, the government's Economic Planning Agency(EPA) downgraded its assessment of the economy from being in a ""quite severe situation"" to a ""prolonged slump"". Investors and officials alike have been holding their breath in Tokyo all week in anticipation of the release by the EPA of its figure for GDP growth between April and June. The announcement, to be made after the stockmarket closes on September lth, is expected to be gloomy. For weeks, private soothsayers have been suggesting the Japanese economy shrank by an annualised 4% or so in that quarter, making it the third such decline in a row. Little wonder Mr Rubin was so agitated in San Francisco. ","With its politics in a tangle , Japan 's economy is unlikely to get a quick boost 
 ONCE again , America will be frustrated over japan 's inability to get its economy swiftly back on its feet . For reasons that seem to make sense only to the Japanese , the good times still lie agonisingly far ahead . This was not how it seemed to America on September 4th . At a meeting in San Francisco , the Japanese finance minister , Kiichi Miyazawa , promised America 's treasury secretary , Robert Rubin , prompt action to stimulate the economy - including nearly 77 trillion ( $ 53 billion ) of tax cuts , a further vio trillion of public works and a freezing of Japan 's austere deficit - reduction law . But the "" sense of urgency "" that Mr Rubin urged on Mr Miyazawa did not survive the journey home . 
 Back in Tokyo even a cut in short - term interest rates , announced on September 9th by the Bank of Japan , was widely seen to reflect fears that politicians would not be able to move quickly enough to revive Japan 's increasingly feeble economy . There is little Mr Miyazawa can do while the ruling Liberal Democratic Party ( LDP ) is pinned down in the Diet ( parliament ) by a gung - ho opposition . Lacking a majority in the upper house , the LDP can govern only by doing deals with the Democratic Party of Japan ( DPJ ) and other opposition groups . When Keizo Obuchi became prime minister in late July , there were fears that Keizo Obuchi would not last until early October , when the current special session of parliament ends . Such worries have subsided slightly since the LDP managed to win one of two recent by - elections . Nevertheless , Keizo Obuchi is regarded as no more than a stop - gap with a year at most to leave Keizo Obuchi's mark . The ruling party has to call a general election before October 2ooo and would get slaughtered if it went to the country with the economy still in a mess and Keizo Obuchi at the helm . The greybeards at LDP headquarters are certain to dump Keizo Obuchi next year in favour of someone with more dash . 
 If another financial disaster is added to the country 's current banking woes , then Keizo Obuchi will not last even that long . Nor might Keizo Obuchi's party . A no - confidence vote in the Diet , triggered by a big financial bankruptcy , and backed by LDP rebels voting with the opposition , could mean a snap election . With the present mood of the electorate , the LDP could kiss goodbye to its modest majority in the Diet 's more powerful lower house . 
 What keeps the LDP leadership awake at night is the possibility that the teetering Long - Term Credit Bank ( LTcB - among the elite of Japan 's banks - will collapse completely and precipitate such a crisis . The government has been pushing Sumitomo Trust , another top bank , to take over LTCB . Keizo Obuchi has vowed that none of the country 's 19 big banks will be allowed to go broke , although some are insolvent . Scare stories have been circulated by the government and the LDP that the failure of any one of them could lead to financial meltdown around the world . 
 A rescue plan for LTCB was first mooted five months ago . But the DPJ , the Liberal Party and the Buddhist - affiliated HeiwaKeikaku group insist that no public money should be used to bail out a bankrupt financial institution without a full disclosure of its records and the heads of the managers responsible . The opposition are adamant that , if taxpayers ' money is used to prop up a bank and to continue loans to legitimate borrowers , then investors must be made to share the pain . Voters have not forgiven the LDP for protecting its investor friends when the government used 685 billion of public money to liquidate seven failed jusen ( housing loan companies ) in 1996 . This time the ruling party wants to sweeten the LTCB takeover deal with up to Y8oo billion of cash . Once again , LDP friends would be beneficiaries .

For several weeks, Japan's prime minister, Keizo Obuchi, has been striving to put together something suitably decorated in time for his meeting with President Bill Clinton in New York on September 22nd. Financial markets are growing increasingly worried about Japan's broken banks and the damage they are inflicting on a fragile world economy. Mr Obuchi may be able to bring with him to New York a political deal on fresh legislation to tackle the crisis. Yet his gift will consist largely of pretty packaging. 
Were they obliged to keep realistic accounts, perhaps half of Japan's 19 biggest banks, which between them account for around 70% of the country's bank assets, would require either immediate nationalisation or a huge injection of fresh capital. With neither forthcoming, the markets have been picking off the weak. The interbank market, in which banks lend shortterm to each other, is all but shut to the weakest big banks, which are probably being kept alive by loans from the central bank. This week, shares in Long-Term Credit Bank traded as low as 19 (15 American cents), down 99.3% from their peak (see chart on next page). Moody's, an American credit-rating agency, has long said that seven other big institutions, including Sakura and Nippon Credit Bank, will not be able to survive without external support. 
Not surprisingly, distressed bankers are cutting their lending, leaving their customers bereft. In August corporate bankruptcies rose for the 15th month in a row, some of them caused by banks' tight-fistedness. Recession-in the three months to June, GDP shrank by 3.3% at an annual rate, a third consecutive quarter of decline-adds more worthless paper to the banks' pile of $1 trillion or so of bad debts-an amount equal to about 3o% of GDP. 
On the face of it, Mr Obuchi's mooted deal should clear the way for a more sensible solution to the crisis. His Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) had wanted to handle small and big banks separately, putting the tiddlers under public administration while rescuing the big banks, whose demise would be a serious loss of national face. Some Y30 trillion was earmarked earlier this year to buy dud assets and pump in fresh capital and pay off depositors. This would have kept the banks, along with the insolvent firms to which they continue to lend, above water. 
But, encouraged by public outrage, a coalition of opposition parties balked at the plans. After three goes at a compromise, the LDP seems at last to have agreed to their core demand: no taxpayers' money unless banks either go bust or are brought under public administration. That ought to introduce a measure of economic judgment into the necessary business of writing off bad loans, foreclosing on duff companies and recapitalising only banks with a real chance of recovery. Provided, that is, the public servants running the show are fairminded and independent, something which is by no means assured. 
Even if it were, a speedy clean-up remains unlikely. Mr Obuchi's administration presumably will not go about its task with any great vigour: the bust property developers, building companies and shopkeepers kept alive by the bust banks are among the LDP's dwindling core constituencies. Supposedly, the audits now being conducted by the grossly understaffed Financial Supervisory Agency, the nominally independent banking regulator hived off from the Ministry of Finance earlier this year, will force the government to act by revealing the banks' true condition. But perhaps not. On September 14th, even as LongTerm Credit Bank's share price was exploring new depths, the agency's boss, Masaharu Hino, told parliament that the bank is not insolvent.

Is the current financial turmoil the beginning of a nightmarish descent? Or could the bottom be somewhere near, making the experience a bruising one rather than threatening life and limb? Ever since its troubles began earlier this decade, such questions have played a crucial role in the stagnation and recession in Japan, the world's second-biggest economy, and by far East Asia's largest. In turn, since East Asia's own turmoil began just over a year ago, Japan's inability to answer them has added greatly to that region's fears and to the world's, helping the trouble to spread to other emerging markets and then to developed ones too. This week, the Japanese government displayed a degree of chaos and confusion over a supposedly ""radical"" bank rescue plan that would have been comic if it were not so serious. As a result, the location of the ground remains a mystery. 
Japan is not the only ground-locator during this difficult period for the world economy, but it is one of the more important. The reason derives partly from its economic size, though that is mitigated by the fact that imports and exports account for only a tenth of that vast GDP. It is also a matter of timing. While America was booming and with Europe recovering, slow growth in Japan could be borne with equanimity. Now, with emerging markets collapsing and with many worrying that America could soon suffer a recession, a revival in Japan is coming to matter more. Finally, the nature of Japan's troubles-a bankrupt financial system, combined with depressed consumer spending and falling prices-has fuelled fears, so far unfulfilled, that recession there could turn into a long-term depression, which would drag others down with it. 
On top of that, there is a pinch of political spice. Until recently Japan's government was admired for its effectiveness and skill, and Japan was the undoubted, if frustratingly diffident, top power in Asia, after the United States itself. Now, with Japan's governing elite discredited and seemingly adrift, some surprisingly sympathetic eyes have swung towards China, with approving comments being made about that country's statesmanlike behaviour and its apparently effective government. A worsening of Japan's economic plight risks turning mere admiring glances into a real switch of allegiance. It might even risk turning the weary apathy of Japanese voters into unstable hostility, leading in new and perhaps dangerous political directions. 
If the bottom of Japan's descent is to be found, and reassurance offered to the world, every Japanese knows that two things are necessary. A painful and credible rescue needs to be launched for Japan's banking system; such a rescue will take time, but proof that it is vigorously under way would begin to reassure people that a depression was not likely and that their savings could safely be spent. Second, a combination of further fiscal stimulus and an aggressive monetary expansion is needed to revive domestic demand, adding to consumer confidence and buying time while the banking reform is carried out. Every Japanese knows this, but Japan's government seems unable, unwilling or too shambolic to deliver it. 
That, alas, was the message of the past week. First there was hope: the government seemed to have struck an agreement with the now-powerful opposition on a banking reform plan. Then there was confusion: the government said the plan was one thing, the opposition quite another. The prime minister, Keizo Obuchi, flew to New York to meet Bill Clinton and said, profoundly, that he was ""neither optimistic nor pessimistic"". But back in Tokyo, there arose a sort of semidespairing hope: the plan is indeed a shambles and will not be implemented quickly, but the signs are that Japan's shrinking economy is at last forcing the country's politicians to accept the need for reform (see pages 21-23). How nice of them finally to get round to it. 
Mr Greenspan's hints So Japan will not help matters much, or not very soon, but at least it will probably-just probably, alas-not make them worse. Meanwhile, Brazil hobbles towards a presidential election fighting to stem the capital flight that threatens its currency; Russia remains Russia; multinational companies find their profits sliding (see page 63); and every day Wall Street traders look nervously over their shoulders, wondering whether the American equity market is merely going to ""correct"" itself by the present 15-20% from its peak, or whether it is destined to halve in value, or worse. 
On September 29th, that will be the awkward context in which the world's most powerful monetary-policy makers, the Open Market Committee of America's Federal Reserve Board, meet to discuss whether to cut short-term interest rates. Should they do so, to save the world and avert depression? 
If that were clearly on the cards, then cut is what they should indeed do. And not their usual quarter of a percentage point. If the aim is to shift market psychology, to ease the pressure on Brazil and other emerging markets and, if you like, to bring the ground closer, then something bigger and really decisive would be required, preferably co-ordinated with cuts in European rates. 
Although it is to be hoped that it won't, that time may come, perhaps quite soon. But it is not here yet, and such a dramatic, psychological weapon is something a wise central banker would do well to keep in reserve for fear of wasting it or even of increasing the panic An internationally-motivated cut that is at odds with the monetary policy merited by the domestic economy could also be dangerous at home and would endanger the cut's very credibility. This week, Alan Greenspan hinted to the Senate that that slowdown was happening, and thus that a cut might be justified. But the data do not yet exist to back this hint (see page 72). 
The American economy may well slow soon, making the risk of a small, slightly premature cut fairly small. That will be tempting to many committee members: be seen to be going in the right direction, but not too riskily. Such a quarter-point cut is what markets seem to expect Mr Greenspan and his colleagues to agree upon. But so far, the resilience of the American economy has often been under-rated. In the (welcome) case that it continues to surprise, a premature cut would increase the risk that the international argument will in future diverge sharply from the domestic one. Although that risk too is small, there is no gain to be had from taking it now. Better to wait, Mr Greenspan.

 Japan is not the only ground - locator during this difficult period for the world economy , but it is one of the more important . The reason derives partly from its economic size , though that is mitigated by the fact that imports and exports account for only a tenth of that vast GDP . It is also a matter of timing . While America was booming and with Europe recovering , slow growth in Japan could be borne with equanimity . Now , with emerging markets collapsing and with many worrying that America could soon suffer a recession , a revival in Japan is coming to matter more . Finally , the nature of Japan 's troubles - a bankrupt financial system , combined with depressed consumer spending and falling prices - has fuelled fears , so far unfulfilled , that recession there could turn into a long - term depression , which would drag others down with it . 
 On top of that , there is a pinch of political spice . Until recently Japan 's government was admired for its effectiveness and skill , and Japan was the undoubted , if frustratingly diffident , top power in Asia , after the United States itself . Now , with Japan 's governing elite discredited and seemingly adrift , some surprisingly sympathetic eyes have swung towards China , with approving comments being made about that country 's statesmanlike behaviour and its apparently effective government . A worsening of Japan 's economic plight risks turning mere admiring glances into a real switch of allegiance . It might even risk turning the weary apathy of Japanese voters into unstable hostility , leading in new and perhaps dangerous political directions . 
 If the bottom of Japan 's descent is to be found , and reassurance offered to the world , every Japanese knows that two things are necessary . A painful and credible rescue needs to be launched for Japan 's banking system ; such a rescue will take time , but proof that it is vigorously under way would begin to reassure people that a depression was not likely and that their savings could safely be spent . Second , a combination of further fiscal stimulus and an aggressive monetary expansion is needed to revive domestic demand , adding to consumer confidence and buying time while the banking reform is carried out . Every Japanese knows this , but Japan 's government seems unable , unwilling or too shambolic to deliver it . 
 That , alas , was the message of the past week . First there was hope : the government seemed to have struck an agreement with the now - powerful opposition on a banking reform plan . Then there was confusion : the government said the plan was one thing , the opposition quite another . Keizo Obuchi , flew to New York to meet Bill Clinton and said , profoundly , that Keizo Obuchi was "" neither optimistic nor pessimistic "" . But back in Tokyo , there arose a sort of semidespairing hope : the plan is indeed a shambles and will not be implemented quickly , but the signs are that Japan 's shrinking economy is at last forcing the country 's politicians to accept the need for reform ( see pages 21 - 23 ) . How nice of them finally to get round to it . 
 Mr Greenspan 's hints So Japan will not help matters much , or not very soon , but at least it will probably - just probably , alas - not make them worse . Meanwhile , Brazil hobbles towards a presidential election fighting to stem the capital flight that threatens its currency ; Russia remains Russia ; multinational companies find their profits sliding ( see page 63 ) ; and every day Wall Street traders look nervously over their shoulders , wondering whether the American equity market is merely going to "" correct "" itself by the present 15 - 20 % from its peak , or whether it is destined to halve in value , or worse . 
 On September 29th , that will be the awkward context in which the world 's most powerful monetary - policy makers , the Open Market Committee of America 's Federal Reserve Board , meet to discuss whether to cut short - term interest rates . Should they do so , to save the world and avert depression ? 
 If that were clearly on the cards , then cut is what they should indeed do . And not their usual quarter of a percentage point . If the aim is to shift market psychology , to ease the pressure on Brazil and other emerging markets and , if you like , to bring the ground closer , then something bigger and really decisive would be required , preferably co - ordinated with cuts in European rates . 
 Although it is to be hoped that it wo n't , that time may come , perhaps quite soon . But it is not here yet , and such a dramatic , psychological weapon is something a wise central banker would do well to keep in reserve for fear of wasting it or even of increasing the panic An internationally - motivated cut that is at odds with the monetary policy merited by the domestic economy could also be dangerous at home and would endanger the cut 's very credibility . This week , Alan Greenspan hinted to the Senate that that slowdown was happening , and thus that a cut might be justified . But the data do not yet exist to back this hint ( see page 72 ) . 
 The American economy may well slow soon , making the risk of a small , slightly premature cut fairly small . That will be tempting to many committee members : be seen to be going in the right direction , but not too riskily . Such a quarter - point cut is what markets seem to expect Mr Greenspan and his colleagues to agree upon . But so far , the resilience of the American economy has often been under - rated . In the ( welcome ) case that it continues to surprise , a premature cut would increase the risk that the international argument will in future diverge sharply from the domestic one . Although that risk too is small , there is no gain to be had from taking it now . Better to wait , Mr Greenspan .",740,Japan,A29-8200,IN TERM,True,"The prime minister , Keizo Obuchi",2,True

Despite confusion over its bank-rescue plans, the government's hand at last looks like being forced by the shrinking economy 
SLOWLY but surely the need to do something painful and dramatic has sunk in. On September 2ist the IMF declared that the main risk to the world economy was that Japan would not ""address its financial-sector problems while ensuring adequate domestic demand."" Time, it added, was now of the essence The next day, Keizo Obuchi, Japan's prime minister, was given the same message when he met President Bill Clinton in New York. He duly promised to make his ""very best efforts to address this issue 
The truth is that the world's patience is running out. Japan is already viewed with a mixture of pity and contempt. It will now be branded a pariah if it fails to deal urgently with its banking crisis, as a crucial first step to getting its debilitated economy, the world's second-biggest, moving again. It would then act at best as the necessary engine for renewed growth across Asia, at least as a vital guard against the danger of world recession turning into depression. 
Such is the disarray surrounding Japan's ruling party, the Liberal Democrats (LDP), that a swift solution looks unlikely. It is too frightened of its old interest-group supporters to mete out the necessary pain; and its opponents, led by the newly popular Democratic Party of Japan (DPJ), have the parliamentary might to block or delay its legislation. Nevertheless there is cause for optimism that though a solution may not be swift, it is on the way. 
The country's real GDP contracted at an annual rate of 3.3% during the April-June quarter, the third consecutive quarterly decline. Bad debts at Japan's banks amount to perhaps 30% of GDP, and several big banks look close to toppling. As yet another bank bailout plan seemed to come apart this week, the Nikkei average of leading Japanese shares tumbled, at one point touching (yen)13,597, a tz-year low. Even the governments perennially optimistic Economic Planning Agency (EPA), which until recently stood by its forecast of 1.9% growth for the year to next March, now expects the economy to shrink by more than 1%. Indpendent think-tanks reckon Japanese GDP will decline by at least 2% this year, and a further 1% next year. 
Why Japan's in trouble Having splurged on new factories and tools during the 198os and early 199os, when capital looked cheap and the world looked like Japan's oyster, corporate Japan now has industrial capacity coming out of its ears. Kenneth Courtis, chief economist for Deutsche Bank in Tokyo, estimates that between 1988 and 1992 Japan added the productive equivalent of France to its economy. Demand for that output has slumped, both at home and in Asia. It is no surprise that corporate spending slid by 5.5% in the latest quarter. 
What about exports, which one might expect to have been boosted by a depreciated yen? Unfortunately, the collapsed Asian market was taking nearly 45% of Japanese exports. Sales to America and Europe have risen, but not by enough to keep the home factories humming. Japan's trade surplus has risen sharply (up 25% year-onyear in August), but mainly because imports are falling precipitately. 
Public borrowing and spending, in true Keynesian fashion, have helped support demand, but they have been overwhelmed by the drop in private demand. In one stimulus package after another, the government has pumped what it claims is close to 80 trillion ($600 billion) into the economy since the Japanese bubble burst in 1991 (though only about a third of this was genuinely new money). This, it hoped, would revive personal spending. Yet only in one year since 1991, in the house-building boom following the Kobe earthquake of 1995, has consumer spending grown by more than a meagre 1-2%. 
Worse, personal spending is now actually shrinking. People brought up on the notion of lifetime employment have begun to feel the chill wind of redundancy, while also worrying about the safety of their savings in banks and life insurance companies. First, overtime and bonuses were slashed; now, as Japanese manufacturers close factories and rationalise production, unemployment is on the rise. Firms that are no longer cushioned from pain by banks that are themselves in trouble are falling like flies. The value of the liabilities left behind by bankruptcies soared last year by 75%. The unemployment rate has climbed above 4% (see chart i). That sounds low by western standards, but is probably equivalent to Mo% if measured in an American or European way. 
Job insecurity and falling incomes are only part of the story. Deflation is also a factor. As households see prices falling, they wait for goods to get cheaper before they buy-and they are not put off by earning so little interest on their savings meanwhile. 
No wonder Mr Obuchi was desperate to have something to show Mr Clinton. But the rescue plan stitched together by Japan's governing and opposition parties on the eve of the prime minister's departure was unravelling even before he arrived. The LDP's old guard had been anxious to protect the failing Long-Term Credit Bank (LTCB), which they had found useful because its non-registered debentures gave them an easily disguised home for their slush funds. As part of the deal to accept the opposition's proposals for dealing with the banking crisis, LDP negotiators inserted a phrase allowing them to use taxpayers' money to bolster Japan's ailing banks-especially the LTCB. That was not the agreement the opposition thought it had struck. 
Maybe this will turn out to be the old guard's last twitch. The party leadership has since made clear (insofar as anything is ever clear in Japanese politics) that it will accept the opposition's proposals more or less intact. That means the all-but-defunct LTCB will first be nationalised before any public money is used to write off bad debts and pay off depositors, which ought to make it easier for managers to be sacked, for investors in LTCB to be forced to share the pain, and for the use of public funds to be properly monitored. If that happens, public opinion will rightly be more supportive of the use of taxpayers' money. 
Moreover, the good news in this, says James Fiorillo, a banking analyst at ING Barings in Tokyo, ""is that LTCB is not going to be treated as a special case."" If anything, the rescue scheme that is being organised for LTCB will become the blueprint for dealing with other troubled banks. 
Of which there are many. Huge parts of the banking system are inhabited by the living dead, kept stumbling along only by infusions from the Bank of Japan. Now the economy is shrinking, many banks are finding that bad loans are rising faster than they can write them down. The only option for the government is to let a lot of them go bust. The belated political acceptance that pain is inevitable may be the breakthrough the rest of the world has been waiting for. 
Banking on change A wholesale restructuring of the banking system is required-something that, for all the world's impatience, cannot be done quickly. It took America three years to work through the $250 billion of duff loans in its savings-and-loan mess.Japan probably has more than four times as much bad debt to deal with. And if tough measures are taken, in the short run the economy will also suffer, as banks shrink their loan-books sharply, and bankruptcies and unemployment will soar. A credible, tough reform plan should in one way boost confidence; but meanwhile, a worsening recession will hurt confidence in other ways. No one can know in advance whether the good effect will outweigh the bad. 
If handled with sufficient ruthlessness, which would mean plenty of debt writeoffs to enable the benefits of a bailout to flow into the real economy, a hard landing should nevertheless lay the ground for eventual recovery. Property prices would fall to a new floor as collateral was sold off. But this should seed new hopes that prices might rise in future, encouraging new construction, house sales and consumer spending. Relieved of their bad debts and recapitalised, banks should start lending again. If punished and shrunk sufficiently, they might even lend more sensibly. 
All of this will involve a good deal of pain. If the government really is now ready for it, it will be thanks not to a new faith in structural reform but to the absence of alternatives. 
In April the government boasted that its latest fiscal package would be the biggest yet-l6.6 trillion, or 3% of GD-and would be sure to revive demand. But the figures mislead. Of the 7.7 trillion to be spent on roads, tunnels, bridges and so on, only z3.9 trillion was new money. Much of the rest merely reversed planned spending cuts-welcome, but not exactly ""extra"". 
Moreover, local governments are being called upon to foot at least (yen)1.5 trillion of the bill, and they are not obliged to comply. More than one-third of their revenues come from corporate taxes, levied on prof its, which have been weak for years. Persistent deficits have meant mounting debts. Earlier this month, Kanagawa prefecture declared a ""state of fiscal emergency"", with the governor announcing land sales, redundancies and even the return of his bonus. Local-government finances in Osaka are messier still. 
As for the (yen)4 trillion in tax cuts, only (yen)2 trillion were new; and none of the cuts are yet permanent. People are less likely to spend extra income if they know their taxes will rise again later. Even if politicians did announce permanent cuts, people might not believe them. Everyone knows the finance ministry is obsessed with the government's ballooning debt (see chart 2 on next page)hence the disastrous fiscal tightening in April 1997. 
Fiscal policy could be more expansionary, but the ministry's worries have restrained it. Monetary policy is also circumscribed. With interest rates close to zero, there is little room for further cuts. Yet the Bank of Japan could pursue a less orthodox policy: a rapid expansion of the money supply via a massive programme of government-bond purchases from banks and other investors-perhaps with a pre-announced target for monetary growth. This, say some pundits, might stimulate extra bank lending and hence the economy. It might also raise inflationary expectations and so encourage people to start spending their tax cuts rather than salting them away. 
It might work, but it is no panacea. Were they obliged to keep realistic accounts, all but two of Japan's 19 major banks would probably be judged inadequately capitalised. With their capital shrinking further as they labour to write off bad debts, and a crashing stockmarket cutting the value of unrealised shareholdings to nothing, it will take a lot to persuade banks to expand lending aggressively. Their first priority will be to rebuild their reserves. 
Loans in Japan cannot be bought and sold easily, which may further discourage banks from making them. Any of the big banks could-despite the government's guarantee of their deposits-suffer a run, such is the feverish atmosphere, and withdrawals have to be met with quick asset sales. The only investment that is both riskfree and liquid is government bondshence the recent collapse of bond yields. 
Nor is it certain that, in aggregate, companies will soon want to borrow more money. Small and mid-sized Japanese firms are gasping for oxygen, partly because they cannot raise money in an underdeveloped bond market. But because over-investment has driven down returns on capital, big companies are loth to borrow. 
There is another possible disadvantage. Printing more money would almost certainly make the yen weaker against other currencies, possibly a lot weaker. From Japan's point of view, that would be a plus. But China has long been threatening that if the yen were to weaken sharply it would be forced to devalue the renminbi and perhaps even the Hong Kong dollar-which conventional wisdom says would also knock the rest of East Asia sideways. In fact, this is far from certain. For one thing, Japan's monetary expansion would not be the only thing influencing the yen's value; disenchantment with dollar securities or falling dollar interest rates might push in the opposite direction. And China's best chance of treating a falling yen as an excuse for its own devaluation could disappear. Politically, China would prefer to devalue at a time when Japanese failure or incompetence is the cause of the yen's fall. If, rather, a weak yen comes as a result of an impressively decisive effort to revive the Japanese economy, to everyone's benefit, China may conclude that in those circumstances a renminbi devaluation would merely pass the regional initiative back to Japan and draw diplomatic brickbats to the Middle Kingdom. 
Banking first 
In any case, although the Bank of Japan has increased its purchases of government bonds, it has so far done so only on a modest scale: a doubling last November to (yen)400 billion per month, and in September an extra (yen)200 billion on top. 
The implication is that the central bank thinks painful structural reform to the banking system should come first. And it might. The political opposition has become united (for the time being, at least) under the leadership of the charismatic Naoto Kan, head ofthe surging Democratic Party of Japan. Even the Communist Party has thrown in its lot with Mr Kan and his allies. For the first time in living memory, the opposition parties are creating genuine policies of their own and-thanks to their combined majority in the upper house are managing to foist them on the government. The opposition's ideas for cleaning up the banking mess will form the basis of the new legislation that Mr Obuchi wants to push through before the current parliamentary session ends on October 7th. 
Under that pressure, the LDP is undergoing metamorphosis as well. The old factions are splintering as new ""study groups"" form to push the views of individuals at odds with the party's mainstream. Many of the LDP'S young Turks have clustered around Seiroku Kajiyama, who has long advocated a hard landing for Japan. A feisty 72-year-old, Mr Kajiyama, a former chief cabinet secretary, ran unsuccessfully against Mr Obuchi in the party leadership race in July. He wants to see the power and size of government reduced, the party's cosy ties with bureaucrats severed, and the regulations that suffocate Japanese business pruned. Pulled from the outside by the opposition and pushed from within by reformers, the LDP is inching towards a total overhaul of the financial system. 
Agreeing to action is only the first step. Next comes wholesale nationalisation of failed institutions, bankruptcy or bailout of thousands of teetering companies, and a firesale of land and property pledged as collateral against vi trillion or more of bad loans. That task is further bedevilled by the question of who directs it. With confidence fragile, there is a danger that good as well as bad institutions will be destroyed. The obvious bureaucrats to separate banking sheep from banking goats would be at the finance ministry; but that ministry has been discredited by its past eight years spent frustrating and distorting reform. 
The compromise that Mr Obuchi has accepted envisages an independent financial revitalisation committee to oversee things, which will probably run Japan's new banking regulator (also stripped from the finance ministry); a new agency to collect bad debts and sell off collateral; and a bridge bank scheme for Japan's regional and smaller lenders. Success will turn on whether the right sort of talent can be found to take charge. For example, if the agency is managed well, with staff paid by results, property prices should fall swiftly and the market begin to clear. If, on the other hand, traditional caution prevails, the country maybe in for another decade of lost growth. 
Yet if it is done, it would be the biggest economic rescue effort since the war, and would lead to big changes in the management and financing of corporate Japan, too. It would be rescue and revolution rolled into one, rather as with the imperial restoration and economic revamping of the Meiji period in the 1860s. It will, however, take time to have its effect, so it must be started now. What is needed, just as 100 years ago, is a genuine reforming government of extraordinary forcefulness and talent. And this suggests that the ineffectual Mr Obuchi should not be kept on for much longer; a general election must be held. The secret to reawakening its dormant economy lies, as ever, in Japan's own hands. ","Japan has put off essential financial reforms for a decade .

For the first time in living memory , the opposition parties are creating genuine policies of their own and - thanks to their combined majority in the upper house are managing to foist them on the government . The opposition 's ideas for cleaning up the banking mess will form the basis of the new legislation that Keizo Obuchi wants to push through before the current parliamentary session ends on October 7th . 
 Under that pressure , the LDP is undergoing metamorphosis as well . The old factions are splintering as new "" study groups "" form to push the views of individuals at odds with the party 's mainstream . Many of the LDP 'S young Turks have clustered around Seiroku Kajiyama , who has long advocated a hard landing for Japan . A feisty 72 - year - old , Mr Kajiyama , a former chief cabinet secretary , ran unsuccessfully against Keizo Obuchi in the party leadership race in July . He wants to see the power and size of government reduced , the party 's cosy ties with bureaucrats severed , and the regulations that suffocate Japanese business pruned . Pulled from the outside by the opposition and pushed from within by reformers , the LDP is inching towards a total overhaul of the financial system . 
 Agreeing to action is only the first step . Next comes wholesale nationalisation of failed institutions , bankruptcy or bailout of thousands of teetering companies , and a firesale of land and property pledged as collateral against vi trillion or more of bad loans . That task is further bedevilled by the question of who directs it . With confidence fragile , there is a danger that good as well as bad institutions will be destroyed . The obvious bureaucrats to separate banking sheep from banking goats would be at the finance ministry ; but that ministry has been discredited by its past eight years spent frustrating and distorting reform . 
 The compromise that Keizo Obuchi has accepted envisages an independent financial revitalisation committee to oversee things , which will probably run Japan 's new banking regulator ( also stripped from the finance ministry ) ; a new agency to collect bad debts and sell off collateral ; and a bridge bank scheme for Japan 's regional and smaller lenders . Success will turn on whether the right sort of talent can be found to take charge . For example , if the agency is managed well , with staff paid by results , property prices should fall swiftly and the market begin to clear . If , on the other hand , traditional caution prevails , the country maybe in for another decade of lost growth . 
 Yet if it is done , it would be the biggest economic rescue effort since the war , and would lead to big changes in the management and financing of corporate Japan , too . It would be rescue and revolution rolled into one , rather as with the imperial restoration and economic revamping of the Meiji period in the 1860s . It will , however , take time to have its effect , so it must be started now . What is needed , just as 100 years ago , is a genuine reforming government of extraordinary forcefulness and talent . And this suggests that Keizo Obuchi should not be kept on for much longer ; a general election must be held . The secret to reawakening its dormant economy lies , as ever , in Japan 's own hands .",740,Japan,A29-8200,IN TERM,True,"Keizo Obuchi , Japan 's prime minister",9,True

The video's release coincided with that of pages of testimony amassed by Kenneth Starr, the independent counsel. This included some details helpful to Mr Clinton.

Such pressure is not illegal, but it makes many people dislike Mr Starr more than Mr Clinton. So may the claim that Mr Starr's report to Congress earlier this month, which relied heavily on Miss Lewinsky's testimony, failed to quote one of her more striking comments.

Mr Starr's team retorts that, even though Mr Clinton was not explicitly obstructive, he nonetheless made it clear to Miss Lewinsky that the truth would not be welcome.

OUTSIDERS watching the shifts and shudders in East Asia's complex security landscape often overlook one of its enduring fault-lines: the prickly relationship between Japan and South Korea. On October 7th South Korea's president, Kim Dae Jung, will pay his first state visit to Japan. When he was elected last December, Mr Kim said he would work for closer ties with Japan. Correspondingly warm words will appear in the communique after the Tokyo talks. But, alas, they will represent no real breakthrough. Japan's new prime minister, Keizo Obuchi, is too preoccupied at home to take Mr Kim boldly at his word. 
Need that matter? Both Japan and South Korea are law-- abiding democracies. Despite their financial troubles, both have played a big part in driving regional prosperity-and will do so again. Both, separately, have close defence ties to the United States. In any case, relations have been warming slowly: next year South Korea will lift its remaining ban on some Japanese manufactured goods, including cars, and it may end the official bar on Japanese films and music (both circulate freely on the black market in the South). Japan has helped South Korea through its recent economic troubles and will also help to pay for new nuclear reactors for communist North Korea to help prevent the regime there from acquiring the bomb. In 2oo2 Japan and South Korea will jointly play host to the next soccer world cup. 
In many ways the two countries are, or should be, allies. They just don't behave that way. Shocked by North Korea's recent test-launch of a rocket over Japan (one that could someday carry a nuclear warhead) some Japanese have turned on the Koreans living in their midst. Though the Japanese government may soon sign the deal to pay for the North's new reactors (delayed by the rocket test), it will question Mr Kim sharply on his ""sunshine policy"" towards the North, which encourages economic contacts with a regime plainly bent on military menace. Meanwhile, the South Korean in the street is quick to show anger at Japan, too, over fishing spats or disputed islands (though both issues should be eased by a new fisheries agreement). And South Korea wants a more ""sincere"" apology from Japan for its colonial rule in Korea and for its mistreatment of Koreans during the second world war. 
Debate the past, consider the future 
History has its place. Japan will never convince its neighbours that history is truly behind it until it has an open and honest debate about its past, as Germany did in the 1970s and 1980s. However, South Korea does itself and the wider region no service by reacting with suspicion, even outright hostility, whenever Japan talks of taking on a bigger role. As a rich, democratic ally, Japan should be doing much more to help America shoulder the regional security burden. And for all South Korea's understandable sensitivities about meddling from outside, Japan has a clear stake in the stability of the Korean peninsula. Meanwhile, renewed interest in Japan in research into limited ballistic missile defences is a prudent reaction to the new North Korean threat, not, as some South Koreans fear, a guise for reviving Japanese militarism. 
South Korea and Japan can seem the worst of friends. Yet their current economic ills, the ever-shifting regional balance with the bigger powers and the future reunification of Korea itself(a matter of when, not if) would all be easier to cope with if the two countries could work together more closely. Rejoining the two Koreas will place a huge strain on relations, not least because a bigger Korea will look to its old rival,Japan, to share the cost. It will require a stronger friendship than South Korea and Japan now have to take that strain. ","South Korea and Japan need to do better than that

Are these signs that ""Asian flu"" has crossed the Pacific and will soon lay low the American West? 
At first glance it seems unlikely. After all, America remains in robust economic health, and it is the western states that have led the nation's prolonged economic boom. From Arizona to Washington jobs have multiplied and investment has risen. California, for example, was deep in recession in 199093; now it leads the nation in high-tech jobs, employing more than 720,000 people at an average wage in 1996 of almost $58,000. In Oregon, personal incomes per head were 90.9% of the national average in 1992; by last year, they had risen to 96.1%. 
Indeed, from Seattle to San Diego the common complaint-partly answered by a congressional vote in September to allow more visas for foreign computer nerds-is of skilled-labour shortages. Since only Wyoming, with its tiny population and declining oil and gas revenues, has lagged behind on the western states' journey to ever-- greater prosperity, their economists are surely entitled to describe the potential impact of Asia's problems as ""a bump in the road"" rather than a damaging pot-hole. 
Unhappily, second glances are less reassuring. One reason is an above-average dependence on Asia for export markets. Whereas around 30% of America's merchandise exports conventionally go to Asia, the share for Oregon is almost two-thirds and for California, the nation's biggest exporter, just over half (see table). Whereas most of America hangs on every word from Alan Greenspan, the chairman of the Federal Reserve, westerners tend to worry more about the nuanced statements of Japan's latest prime minister, Keizo Obuchi. After all, Japan is both the single biggest market for most of their high-tech exports and the now-sputtering engine of Asian economic growth. As long as Japan remains in recession, so will the western states' other export markets in East and South-East Asia. 
A second reason for worry is that economic diversity provides little immunity. High-tech exports may be affected by slumping demand and sliding currencies in Asia, but so too are agricultural products and minerals. Washington apple-growers had been anticipating a growing appetite in Japan; instead, they have seen their exports in the past year drop by a third. In Seattle the Boeing aircraft company, normally the country's single biggest exporter, is having to adjust to the fact that Asia's airlines are now flying almost empty. Exports of coal, copper and other minerals from Utah, Wyoming and Montana are beginning to slip because of falling demand in Asia and cut-price competition from Russia and China. Moreover, if the investors who have fled Asia and Russia abandon Latin America, too, then the West will really be in trouble: Mexico, for example, is California's biggest market after Japan. 
All this prompted a sobering warning at a recent conference in Denver from Kelly Matthews, chief economist of Utah's First Security Corporation. ""The deflationary impact of Asia on the world's economy"", he said, ""in all likelihood will be more severe and prolonged than current consensus expects."" Is Mr Matthews a Cassandra, or will history prove him wrong? The optimists can mount some powerful arguments. Boeing, for example, is used to rescheduling aircraft deliveries for hard-pressed customers (cancelling a firm order can cost a customer dear). Similarly, many high-tech Asian companies, however strapped for dollars, will have no option but to keep buying parts and software from American companies. 
As for the western states' mineral and farm exports, they will surely grow over time as less developed Asian countries such as China, Vietnam and Indonesia increasingly industrialise and switch to more meat and grain in their diets. Too optimistic by half? Maybe so. But in the meantime, to the relief of the potato farmers of Idaho and Washington, there is one export so far holding its share of the Asian market: the American ""French fry"".

More than two decades have passed since Mr Kim, then an opposition leader, was abducted from an hotel in Tokyo and nearly killed by his country's secret agents. But now Mr Kim was visiting Tokyo as head of state with a mission of his own. He wants to build a solid economic and security alliance with the former coloniser that ruled Korea for 36 years until 1945. 
On October 8th, Mr Kim appeared relieved after talks with Keizo Obuchi, the Japanese prime minister, who not only offered his country's ""deep remose and heartfelt apology"" for Japan's colonial rule, but also offered to lend South Korea $3 billion, in addition to $1 billion already committed. But several thorny issues will have to be resolved before the two countries can become friends. 
Many South Koreans continue to demand that the Japanese government should pay compensation to about 150 surviving Korean ""comfort women"" forced into sexual slavery in Japanese army brothels between 1932 and 1945. Historians reckon some 200,ooo women, mostly from Korea, were involved. Japanese officials argue that the $5oom it paid to the South Korean government in 1965, when the two countries normalised diplomatic relations, extinguishes all compensation claims. Koreans who fought in the second world war and are still living in Japan also want compensation, as many are not eligible for Japanese pensions. Hundreds of thousands of Koreans were sent as forced labour to Japan in that war, or conscripted to fight alongside Japanese soldiers. 
Another contentious issue is a revised fisheries agreement. Only days before Mr Kim's visit, South Korea and Japan struck a deal to end a dispute over fishing rights. The eastern limit for South Korean fishing boats (and the western one for the Japanese) was drawn at 135.5 degrees. The two countries also created a joint fishing zone between their exclusive fishing areas, but fishermen in both countries are still not satisfied, and complain that they have only limited access to an area of abundant squid. Nor is there any agreement over who has sovereignty over Tokdo (or Takeshima, as the Japanese call it), a small island in the East Sea (Sea of Japan). This dispute has long been a dormant volcano. 
Meanwhile, North Korea continues to worry both sides. Mr Kim's government is now embroiled in a row over allegations that the opposition party, when it was in power, tried to bribe North Korea into launching an armed confrontation at the truce village of Panmunjom, on the heavily fortified border, during last year's election campaign. The purpose of this, it is claimed, was to worry voters in the hope that they would not support Mr Kim, who is trying to establish some form of relationship with the Stalinist regime in the North through his ""sunshine policy"". The opposition denies the charge and claims that government agents have obtained ""confessions"" through the use of torture. 
None of this does much to calm public anger in Japan over North Korea's test firing of a missile over Japanese territory in August. The incident exacerbated antagonism toward Koreans living in Japan and prompted the Japanese government to suspend a $i billion contribution to build two nuclear power stations in North Korea. The Japanese have now proposed a new series of talks about North Korea. 
Tricky as his northern neighbour is, Mr Kim seems determined not to let the North get in the way of improving relations with Japan. He joined Mr Obuchi in announcing plans to foster economic and cultural exchanges between the two countries. South Korea will also lift a ban on imports of 48 Japanese products, such as cars, next year-a bold step for a country that ran a $13 billion trade deficit with Japan last year. But imports of Japanese popular culture, including pop music and films, will continue to be banned. 
There is considerable opposition to Japanese culture in South Korea, especially among academics and bureaucrats, who claim that Japanese popular influences will corrupt Korean children and do harm to impressionable teenagers. But despite (or perhaps because of) the ban, lots of popmaterial is smuggled into South Korea. Pirated copies of Japanese films and records are widely available in the capital, Seoul. So there was no surprise that Shunji Iwai, a young Japanese film director, recently received a frenzied reception from Korean fans at a film festival in South Korea. Whether the Japanese emperor and empress would receive such a welcome is another matter, even if they accepted Mr Kim's offer to visit Korea in the near future.

THE people of Osaka are famous for their sense of humour. For those in charge of the city's finances, which are a bad joke, that is just as well. ""Our situation is very, very worrying,"" grins Masaji Hashimoto, who heads the city's budgetplanning department. ""The central government has to understand that all we can do is cut, cut, cut."" 
The government sees little to laugh at. With the economy slipping deeper into recession-this week the government gave up hope of economic growth for this year, predicting that GDP would shrink by 1.8%-the ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) had hoped that a public-works programme announced in April would help stop the rot. That overlooked one small detail, however: local governments were asked to do much of the spending. Instead of forking out more, some of the most financially imperilled ones, such as Osaka, are planning cuts. 
The immediate problem is the LDP's supplementary budget, passed in April, which promised 7.7 trillion-worth ($58 billion) of public-works projects. Of this, Y3 trillion was to be financed jointly by central and local governments, with the cost split 50-50. A further Y1.5 trillion, said the LDP, would be ""independent"" public works, wholly paid for by local governments. 
These promises were, it transpires, hopelessly optimistic. Miyagi, Yamagata and Iwate prefectures in northern Japan are unlikely to push through even half their independent projects, according to the Bank of Japan. Tokyo and Osaka have refused any increase in independent projects and made only modest rises in subsidised spending. Although the LDP is planning a second supplementary budget, local authorities will find it hard even to maintaining spending at current levels. Osaka, says Mr Hashimoto, faces ten years or more of intolerably large deficits unless it cuts spending. In the next fiscal year the prefecture plans to lop 10% off subsidised public works; money for projects financed locally will be halved. 
Until now, relying on local governments to carry out spending plans has suited the Tokyo bureaucrats nicely. Localgovernment debt is not counted in centralgovernment figures because the government offers no explicit guarantee that creditors will be repaid. By shifting the financing burden for deficit spending to the provinces, the central government has been able to improve its books. 
But as in all of Japan's 47 prefectural governments, Osaka's finances have been squeezed mercilessly by central demands to step up spending just as tax revenues have collapsed. They have been forced to tap rainy-day funds and to raise vast amounts of debt, which has nearly tripled in ten years (see chart). Thus impoverished, local authorities have become increasingly dependent on subsidies from Tokyo; this year, for example, four-fifths of the interest payments on shared projects will come from central-government coffers. 
Not all of it, however; and local governments still have to foot the bill for projects not shared with Tokyo. They are running out of money. Osaka has exhausted its Y100 billion of reserves. Tokyo's metropolitan government has only vi billion left from a fund that contained 35o billion a few years ago. And to make matters worse, as local authorities' debt burden has increased, investors in their bonds have begun to fret about the lack of an explicit government guarantee. At an auction in Tokyo last month, investors demanded o.3 percentage points above the ""suggested"" coupon for local-government bonds. 
Parsimonious provinces 
So the subsidies that once persuaded local officials to fall into line may no longer work. Mr Hashimoto says that any centrally inspired increases in subsidised public works will be met with cuts in independent projects. In Tokyo, the rhetoric is more strident still. ""The government is not satisfied with what we are prepared to spend,"" says Yasushi Nakamura of the city's budget bureau. ""But that is what they will get."" 
That still leaves the centre with a few options. The prime minister, Keizo Obuchi, promised this week an emergency spending package of at least io trillion. This could be explicitly financed by the central government. But that would require Mr Obuchi to take on the finance ministry's mighty budget bureau, and he is no match for it. Alternatively, the money could be used to reinvigorate personal consumption. Some of the ideas floating around Tokyo-making temporary income-tax cuts permanent, giving house-buyers tax breaks, even issuing free shopping vouchers-seek to do that. 
The likes of Osaka, though, plan to cut spending regardless. If they are to be persuaded otherwise, their battered finances need to be repaired. Some prefectural governors, for instance, are calling for a doubling of the local-government share of consumption taxes collected at the checkout. Mr Hashimoto is hopeful that, for once, the government is listening to their demands. If he is wrong, Japan could be in for a new and painful bout of belt-tightening.

But Naoto Kan, the dashing young leader of the Democratic Party of Japan (DPJ), has just seen his chances of toppling the ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) fade, along with his hopes of heading a coalition government formed from a grand alliance of opposition parties. After months of haggling with Mr Kan and his colleagues over how to tackle Japan's banking mess, the LDP split the opposition and bulldozed a rescue plan through the Diet (parliament) on October 12th (see page 86). Outmanoeuvred by the LDP, Mr Kan and his opposition partners now look rather shaky. 
Few expected the newly formed alliance to splinter quite so quickly or so easily. In july, hot from a stunning victory in the upper-house election, Mr Kan and his allies had the LDP over a barrel. People were talking of a snap election being called in October as Keizo Obuchi's government collapsed amid the financial chaos triggered by a handful of big banks and large building companies going spectacularly bust. 
With their majority in the upper house, Mr Kan and his partners had managed to thwart the LDP'S attempts to use taxpayers' money to bail out friends in the farming and building industries who were being hurt by the country's banking troubles. In particular, Mr Kan's DPJ, along with the Buddhist-affiliated Heiwa-Kaikaku group and the conservative Liberal Party, were adamant that no public money should be used to bail out any banks or companies without first having full disclosure of their records and the heads of the managers responsible for their plight. 
The opposition's hand was further strengthened by the tightness of a deadline imposed on the government: it had to have a realistic rescue plan in place so Mr Obuchi would not have to face Bill Clinton empty-handed at their meeting in New York on September 22nd. Pressed for time, the LDP agreed to accept virtually all of Mr Kan's demands for dealing more responsibly with bankrupt institutions. 
But even before the ink was dry on the pact with the opposition, the ruling party was preparing a plan to skewer the Dn] and push through a less onerous bank bail-out scheme for its friends. An unwitting White House was even roped in to lend a hand. Mr Kan was hobbled when Robert Rubin, the treasury secretary, and other American officials-who had been preaching to Asian governments about the need to tighten their belts-told the Japanese visitors to throw public money at their banking problem. That was music to Mr Obuchi's ears. 
Back home, the LDP quickly cut a series of deals with the Social Democratic Party of Japan (SDPJ), the Liberal Party and the Heiwa-Kaikaku group. The SDPJ, which has trade-union connections, wanted to save jobs in companies that were being squeezed mercilessly by their banks, so the party was keen to see public money used to bail out the banking industry. To make it happy, Mr Obuchi announced that he was planning to spend lots of public money some (Yen)60 trillion ($500 billion). 
At first Ichiro Ozawa's Liberal Party resisted the LDP's desire to squander taxpayers' savings, but it reversed its position in order to appease its right-wing friends in the LDP. They had come to fear that their dirty laundry would be revealed if the teetering Long-Term Credit Bank went broke, and that was beginning to look imminent 
Meanwhile, the Heiwa-Kaikaku parliamentary block was bought off with a promise from Mr Obuchi that the LDP would definitely not call a general election before the two Buddhist-affiliated parties in the lower house and their Komei religious colleagues in the upper house had completed their reunification plans. The Buddhist parties fear they would lose half their seats if they had to fight an election in their present fractured state. Come next April, the deep-pocketed Soka Gakkai group which owns them intends to merge all three Buddhist-affiliated parties that splintered from the former Komeito (Clean Government Party) in 1994. 
Political pundits have begun to wonder whether the LDP is in the process of putting together another non-cabinet coalition like the one it had until this summer with the SDPJ and the Sakigake, but this time with the soon-to-be-reconstituted Komeito.

IT TOOK forever, endangered the financial system and, some shrieked, even threatened the global economy. Yet at least, argued the hopefuls, Japan's political squabble over its broken banks would eventually produce a saner blueprint for fixing them. This week, the ruling Liberal Democratic Party at last pushed the relevant bills through parliament. Yet aside from the enormous sums involved, the LDP's new plans seem remarkable chiefly for their similarity to the old. 
Even a bad plan may, however, be better than none at all. Around the world, jumpy central banks were wondering whether any public money at all would be forthcoming, and feared financial havoc. Their nerves will be soothed by the 6o trillion ($5oo billion) that the prime minister, Keizo Obuchi, has secured to pay for the bail-out, double the amount originally earmarked in January. 
Beyond that, there is little to celebrate. The sticking point had been the fate of the major banks, which account for 70% of lending. The LDP had wanted to bail out weak and strong banks alike, with no clear rules for the use of public funds and no tough penalties for banks that got the money.A loose coalition of opposition parties, backed by friendly forces at the Bank of Japan, argued that this made little sense. Unless the banks were forced to write off some of their $1 trillion or so of duff loans at the same time, they would simply use the money to roll over their bad debts. 
The new legislation certainly looks better than the old. The big banks will be sorted according to their capital strength. The weakest will be merged, nationalised or simply closed down. Should the rest need public money, they will be subject to tough conditions: management resignations, business restrictions, closer scrutiny of loan books and so on. And to ensure sound judgment at the top, the LDP has entrusted control of financial policy to an independent ""financial revitalisation committee"", stripping these powers from the finance ministry, which has lost its credibility after presiding for so long over a steadily worsening financial system. 
If applied, such a plan might put the LDP out of office, because it would badly hurt some of its core political supportersbust construction companies, property developers and agricultural co-operatives, to name a few. To bind the government to such political sacrifice, the opposition reasoned that it must be allowed no wiggleroom. Unfortunately, it has secured plenty. 
In March, it abandoned all vestiges of realistic accounting by allowing banks to value their massive share portfolios, whose worth counts towards their capital, at historical rather than current market prices. According to Brian Waterhouse of HsBC Securities, the stockmarket's collapse this year means that without the new rules 14 big banks might well have failed to meet internationally agreed minimum capital standards when they closed their half-yearly accounts at the end of September. Of these, two international banks-Yasuda Trust and Daiwa-would have reported capitaladequacy ratios of less than 4%, a trigger under the new legislation for instant nationalisation. 
Because all banks except Bank of TokyoMitsubishi have now chosen historical cost accounting, however, all will report capital levels greater than the 8% minimum. This accounting fiction will endure until ""the financial system stabilises"". With everyone feigning rude health, a cure for the crisis can once again be put on hold. 
Even if the government were resolved to act, it would almost certainly fail, for a second key opposition demand has also been thwarted. The scheme remains voluntary. It depends on public-spirited bank managers, who are expected to apply for government money, turn their loan books over to the regulators, sack themselves and perhaps pull down the shutters afterwards. Surviving institutions would then use their government cash to make new loans rather than simply to renew or write off old ones. These hopes are unrealistic: more likely, the government is heading for a re-run of the shambolic episode in March when it could persuade none of the big banks to accept its money. Eventually it had to hand out equal and insignificant sums to each of them. 
Astonishingly, the LDP is now floating ideas in the press for a quick and dirty 20 trillion recapitalisation of the major banks before the financial revitalisation committee is even appointed. By circumventing the conditions attached to the use of taxpayers' money, this might at least bring the banks on board. But a pain-free bail-out would be as unpopular with Japanese voters as a painful one. ""Without the understanding of the voters,"" Naoto Kan, leader of the opposition Democratic Party of Japan, said this week, ""no plan would work properly."" In the absence of such an understanding, the government seems to have decided, yet again, to muddle through while it still has the chance. ","Japanese banks

Even a bad plan may, however, be better than none at all. Around the world, jumpy central banks were wondering whether any public money at all would be forthcoming, and feared financial havoc. Their nerves will be soothed by the 6o trillion ($5oo billion) that the prime minister, Keizo Obuchi, has secured to pay for the bail-out, double the amount originally earmarked in January. 
Beyond that, there is little to celebrate. The sticking point had been the fate of the major banks, which account for 70% of lending. The LDP had wanted to bail out weak and strong banks alike, with no clear rules for the use of public funds and no tough penalties for banks that got the money.A loose coalition of opposition parties, backed by friendly forces at the Bank of Japan, argued that this made little sense. Unless the banks were forced to write off some of their $1 trillion or so of duff loans at the same time, they would simply use the money to roll over their bad debts. 
The new legislation certainly looks better than the old. The big banks will be sorted according to their capital strength. The weakest will be merged, nationalised or simply closed down. Should the rest need public money, they will be subject to tough conditions: management resignations, business restrictions, closer scrutiny of loan books and so on. And to ensure sound judgment at the top, the LDP has entrusted control of financial policy to an independent ""financial revitalisation committee"", stripping these powers from the finance ministry, which has lost its credibility after presiding for so long over a steadily worsening financial system. 
If applied, such a plan might put the LDP out of office, because it would badly hurt some of its core political supportersbust construction companies, property developers and agricultural co-operatives, to name a few. To bind the government to such political sacrifice, the opposition reasoned that it must be allowed no wiggleroom. Unfortunately, it has secured plenty. 
In March, it abandoned all vestiges of realistic accounting by allowing banks to value their massive share portfolios, whose worth counts towards their capital, at historical rather than current market prices. According to Brian Waterhouse of HsBC Securities, the stockmarket's collapse this year means that without the new rules 14 big banks might well have failed to meet internationally agreed minimum capital standards when they closed their half-yearly accounts at the end of September. Of these, two international banks-Yasuda Trust and Daiwa-would have reported capitaladequacy ratios of less than 4%, a trigger under the new legislation for instant nationalisation. 
Because all banks except Bank of TokyoMitsubishi have now chosen historical cost accounting, however, all will report capital levels greater than the 8% minimum. This accounting fiction will endure until ""the financial system stabilises"". With everyone feigning rude health, a cure for the crisis can once again be put on hold. 
Even if the government were resolved to act, it would almost certainly fail, for a second key opposition demand has also been thwarted. The scheme remains voluntary. It depends on public-spirited bank managers, who are expected to apply for government money, turn their loan books over to the regulators, sack themselves and perhaps pull down the shutters afterwards. Surviving institutions would then use their government cash to make new loans rather than simply to renew or write off old ones. These hopes are unrealistic: more likely, the government is heading for a re-run of the shambolic episode in March when it could persuade none of the big banks to accept its money. Eventually it had to hand out equal and insignificant sums to each of them. 
Astonishingly, the LDP is now floating ideas in the press for a quick and dirty 20 trillion recapitalisation of the major banks before the financial revitalisation committee is even appointed. By circumventing the conditions attached to the use of taxpayers' money, this might at least bring the banks on board. But a pain-free bail-out would be as unpopular with Japanese voters as a painful one. ""Without the understanding of the voters,"" Naoto Kan, leader of the opposition Democratic Party of Japan, said this week, ""no plan would work properly."" In the absence of such an understanding, the government seems to have decided, yet again, to muddle through while it still has the chance. ",740,Japan,A29-8200,,False,,0,True

Mr Nukaga's only mistake was his failure to notice the landmine lurking beneath a defence scandal that has now blown up in his face. To try to save Mr Nukaga, as well as himself, the prime minister, Keizo Obuchi, has fired some of the SDA's top officials. But that has not stopped the demands for Mr Nukaga's head.

But instead of hounding the culprits at the sDA, Mr Nukaga went along meekly with the defence agency's own brazen attempts to sweep the scandal there under the carpet. 
That may have worked in the distant murky past, but not since the Tokyo Public Prosecutor's Office established its awesome reputation for nailing government wrongdoers. Twice last month the prosecutor's young investigators barged their way into the sDA's headquarters to prevent officials from shredding still more evidence. They have already indicted Masuo Morodomi and Kenichi Ueno, two former officials in the agency's central procurement office. Both are being held on suspicion of having let two subsidiaries of the NEC group off 3.6 billion ($30m) of the 4.8 billion their companies had overcharged the government, in exchange for providing agency officials with cushy jobs after retirement. Some nine former and current NEC group executives have also been arrested for breach of trust. 
All of which might have been just another case of bureaucratic corruption, dismissed by an ever cynical public. But having failed to mount an effective noconfidence motion against Mr Obuchi's government in the all-important lower house of the Diet (parliament) for its handling the country's banking crisis, Mr Kan and his opposition colleagues have now moved their guerrilla campaign to the upper house where they have a majority. On October 16th, the senior chamber voted to adopt a censure motion against Mr Nukaga-the first such resolution passed by the upper house since the constitution was promulgated in 1947. 
It is true that, unlike a censure motion against the cabinet or a minister in the lower house, a no-confidence vote in the upper house is non-binding. Even so, the outcome can be politically damaging. After the vote the DPJ barred Mr Nukaga from attending an upper house oversight committee. The opposition has now threatened to boycott meetings of the upper house audit committee if Mr Nukaga tries to participate. But there is even worse in store for the government. The bills needed to get new security guidelines in place in support of the security treaty with the United States, as well as a joint ballistic missile defence programme planned with the Americans, will be held hostage by the opposition if Mr Nukaga stays. 
What bothers Mr Obuchi and his colleagues in the ruling Liberal Democratic Party is that, having demonstrated the effectiveness of their new tactics, the opposition could start knocking off one cabinet member after another. There are more than enough potential embarrassments in the government to make unwitting ministers sitting ducks.

Together with the Y6o trillion he has already promised to fix Japan's banks, Mr Obuchi will have in one month pledged to spend $640 billion-or i6% of annual GDP. Yet the bond market remains calm. 
In fact, Japan's super-low interest rates keep heading lower-and are even, in some cases, negative. Until recently, it cost the government nothing at all to borrow at short maturities. Now, in effect, investors are paying it to take their money. Foreign bankers have become so unwilling to lend surplus yen to Japanese rivals that they prefer to park them with each other at negative rates of interest. This means that the recipients of the deposits can still make a respectable margin even though long-term interest rates are so low. 
And how: ten-year government bonds (JGBS) are now yielding a startlingly meagre o.81% (see chart. At these prices, investors seem to be betting on an economic catastrophe-shrinking output and falling prices for the next decade or so. That hardly squares with Mr Obuchi's lavish plans for Japan to spend its way out of trouble.

These measures will leave a gaping hole in the nation's books. Peter Morgan, an economist with HsBC Securities, thinks the combined budget deficits of Japan's central and local governments will hit to.2% of GDP in the current fiscal year, which ends in March. To finance this, he reckons the government may have to issue 54.8 trillion-worth of bonds, a rise of 46% over the previous year. Markets humble governments with much sounder finances than these. Why is Japan different? 
Mainly because it is the world's largest creditor. Foreign-currency debts are tiny, and Japan's current-account surplus is growing larger (it was 2.3% of GDP in 1997). Nor is there much foreign money in the domestic debt market, which might suddenly flee for higher returns elsewhere. In fact, there is little private money of any sort going into JGBS. Most of the government's extra bond sales are being absorbed by its own Trust Fund Bureau, which invests the vast wealth piled up in the postal savings system, and by the central bank. Nor is increased government borrowing crowding out the private sector. Indeed, as companies continue to cut their investment, their demand for capital is shrinking. And so long as interest rates stay close to zero, the bill for servicing the government's debts is easily affordable. 
Perversely, all this is probably bad news for Japan. As deflation takes hold, consumers are spending less; and the real cost of the debts that cripple vast tracts of Japanese industry is rising. If they believed their government were borrowing more money than it could pay back, the Japanese might start to believe in inflation again-and so begin spending more money, helping the economy to recover.

One subject was a request for an apology for Japanese wartime atrocities. Japan's government has been more willing of late to offer visitors some carefully-phrased words of remorse. The Chinese are unlikely to get as far with their concerns about Japan's expanded security links with America (see page 28). And despite talk of a ""new partnership"" there is little chance of the Japanese following Bill Clinton's lead earlier this year and declaring support for China's stance on Taiwan, which the Chinese regard as a renegade province. 
If anything, Japan's stance on foreign policy is likely to grow tougher. So too is the prospect of Japan being prepared to deploy its forces with American ones during any regional emergencies. This is because of the return to an alliance with the ruling Liberal Democratic Party(LDP) of Ichiro Ozawa, the hawkish leader of Japan's dwindling Liberals. Mr Ozawa's Liberal Party now plans to form a coalition with the ruling party. A conservative who deserted the LDP with a band of followers in 1993 after an aborted bid for power, Mr Ozawa has since seen his own party marginalised as supporters slipped away, frustrated by his overbearing leadership and failure to deliver reforms. 
The final straw for Mr Ozawa came earlier this month when the Soka Gakkai, a wealthy lay Buddhist organisation, not only deprived his party of an important chunk of its membership but also the bulk of its financial support. Without the Soka Gakkai's deep pockets and its 8m families working feverishly to get out the vote, the Liberal Party faces annihilation at a general election, which could happen at any time given the LDP's lack of a majority in the upper house of the Diet (parliament). 
Mr Ozawa's agreement to form a coalition with the ruling party won from Keizo Obuchi, the prime minister, a promise that the LDP would not challenge Liberal Party incumbents in an election. But the coalition seems shaky. Mr Obuchi spoke without the LDP's full authority and may not be able to persuade his party's local chapters to go along with the deal. Still, the coalition is Mr Ozawa's last chance to get back into the political mainstream. 
Luckily for him, the LDP leaders seem to need him almost as much as he needs them. Although the ruling party has a majority in the more important lower house, its lack of one in the upper house has frustrated its plans to reform the debilitated banking industry, forcing it to accept the opposition's more brutal legislation. The liberal's seats in the upper house will allow the LDP to push through most legislation. 
Mr Ozawa can be overbearing, but at least he has some refreshing views of his own. In the short term, his influence on Mr Obuchi's administration is likely to be positive. Prior to forming a full cabinet-level coalition in January, the Liberal Party will work closely with the government during the 3o-day extraordinary Diet session that starts on November 27th. Mr Ozawa wants to suspend a 5% consumption tax, but may settle for seeing its revenue reserved for welfare purposes, such as pensions. He also wants a lo trillion ($82 billion) cut in income and residential taxes instead of the ruling party's trifling Y4 trillion cut. ""I will dissolve the coalition if the policy is not implemented,"" he puffs. 
He will probably do no such thing. But he will certainly hector and hassle to get his way on such matters as reducing the size of the cabinet from 20 to to 17 (to improve his own party's clout) as well as slimming down both houses of the Diet by 50 seats apiece (for the same reason) He may even get the LDP to go along with his conviction that the constitution must be re-interpreted to allow Japanese soldiers to serve alongside foreign troops on UN peacekeeping missions abroad. Divided as it is over collaborating with the Liberal Party, Mr Obuchi's ruling party will nevertheless go out of its way to make Mr Ozawa happy. 
The other pressing reason to do so is that the government is desperate to get long-overdue legislation through the Diet to allow the Japanese Self-Defence Force (the name given to its armed services) to cooperate with American forces. In Tokyo on November 2oth, Mr Clinton urged Japan to make an extra effort to pass the necessary bills because of mounting tension in the Koreas. American officials suspect that an underground complex being built in North Korea could herald the resumption of its efforts to produce plutonium for nuclear weapons. Japanese officials are also concerned, not least because the North Koreans test-fired a missile over Japan in August.

FOR a man who calls himself a ""plodding ox"", Keizo Obuchi has a surprising turn of speed. First, the Japanese prime minister split the opposition, strengthening the slippery grip on power of his ruling Liberal Democratic Party (see page 43) Then he announced a 24 trillion ($198 billion) boost for the economy, the biggest yet Now, his government is claiming a success no other administration in seven years has come close to achieving: clearing up the country's banking mess. 
By November 24th, 15 of Japan's 18 surviving big banks had said they would apply for public loans from a 66o trillion rescue package cobbled together in October. The other three may yet join the queue for hand-outs. Only one of them, Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi, has turned the offered funds down flat, and most observers expect it to have second thoughts. Between them, the 15 applicants agreed to take Y5.8 trillion-far short of the Y25 trillion that the government hoped they would accept, but a tidy sum nonetheless. 
The doubt now is over whether the banks will start tackling the real problem: their massive bad loans. Even by Japanese standards, the conditions attached to the bail-out are ambiguous. But, no question, they hugely favour the banks. With bank loans continuing to shrink-by an unprecedented 3.3% year-on-year in October-the government had been talking about forcing the banks to lend some of its money out again. Now the conditions they have to meet to have access to the rescue cash are even softer than expected. So the banks are likely to use most of it to write down their bad debts instead. 
The volume of these is staggering. James Fiorillo of ING Barings Securities, a Dutch investment bank, thinks that Japan's 18 biggest banks have 41.4 trillion ($345 billion) of bad or doubtful loans between them. Assuming that they manage to recover onefifth of this, Mr Fiorillo reckons that, despite the provisions they have already made, they still need to set aside an additional Y19.5 trillion to cover their losses. That is more than triple the amount they have just requested from the government. Even Mr Fiorillo, an optimist among Tokyo's hard-bitten bank analysts, thinks that the recapitalisation could drag on for another two to three years. 
Nor, alas, is it clear what the government will get for its money. It is highly unlikely that the banks' shareholders will have been punished in any way. Most of the money will probably be injected through purchases of preferred stock-a sort of cross between equity and debt, which in this case will look much more like debt than equity. The government will have no chance to convert it into bank shares-so it will gain nothing if the banks return to health. And the banks can pay it back when it suits them. That, says David Atkinson of Goldman Sachs, an American investment bank, makes the money, in effect, a low-interest loan, with few strings attached. 
No mending of ways 
Unfortunately, this leaves the banks with little incentive to press ahead with serious restructuring-branch closures, lay-offs, mergers and so on. Nor will it necessarily help the economy. For the government's rescue funds to work, the banks must use them either to forgive some of their loans or to force the borrowers into bankruptcy, thus freeing up resources that could be put to better use. Otherwise, the money will simply sit on the banks' own books-as reserves against loans that soured long ago. 
A few recent deals have kindled some hope. Aoki, a middling-sized construction company, asked its banks to forgive Y200 billion of loans. Towa Real Estate, a developer affiliated with the big Fujita construction firm, has asked Tokai Bank to do much the same. But there is a mountain of worthless paper to clear up, and progress is still grindingly slow. That is hardly surprising. With super-low interest rates, it costs banks almost nothing to carry their bad loans. 
More seriously, property prices have collapsed, and the legal system is no longer capable of resolving disputes between warring creditors. Consider a piece of property that secures equal loans to six different banks. Now the property may be worth only a sixth of its former value. But if the borrower is forced into bankruptcy and the property is sold, only the bank with first claim on it will be repaid. Any decision to foreclose, however, requires a majority vote among all the creditors. The result? Stalemate. Nor are banks keen on forgiving debts, for the obvious reason that this means a transfer of wealth from them to their borrowers in the construction and property industries. 
One way or another, the government will probably have to force the banks to act Doing so explicitly is difficult under Japan's constitution, but there are plenty of ways they could be made to behave. For instance, the banking regulator, the Financial Supervisory Agency (FSA), could threaten round-the-clock audits, or it could withhold licences to do business. Dismissed at first as a poodle of the finance ministry (from which it was hived off last July, and from where its staff have come), the FSA has recently been talking a good game. It was unexpectedly candid, for example, about the dubious accounting practices of the failed Long-Term Credit Bank (LTCB), which was put out of its misery in October and taken into public ownership. The LTCB had tried to hide more than vi trillion of bad debts in dummy companies. 
Mr Atkinson, who was asked to give evidence to a government committee on bank reform this summer, found the experience discouraging. After he had told the politicians how banks and borrowers might renegotiate their loans, the banks responded by attacking him personally. Later, the government quietly dropped legislation, instigated by borrowers, which would have provided a forum for negotiations with banks. Given the strength ofthe banking lobby, Mr Atkinson argues that ""the FSA needs political support-and there isn't any."" Expect that ox to start plodding again. ","This week , Japan took a belated step towards fixing its broken banks . It has a long way still to go 
 FOR Keizo Obuchi Obuchi has a surprising turn of speed . First , Keizo Obuchi split the opposition , strengthening the slippery grip on power of Keizo Obuchi's ruling Liberal Democratic Party ( see page 43 ) Then Keizo Obuchi announced a 24 trillion ( $ 198 billion ) boost for the economy , the biggest yet Now , Keizo Obuchi's government is claiming a success no other administration in seven years has come close to achieving : clearing up the country 's banking mess . 
 By November 24th , 15 of Japan 's 18 surviving big banks had said they would apply for public loans from a 66o trillion rescue package cobbled together in October . The other three may yet join the queue for hand - outs . Only one of them , Bank of Tokyo - Mitsubishi , has turned the offered funds down flat , and most observers expect it to have second thoughts . Between them , the 15 applicants agreed to take Y5.8 trillion - far short of the Y25 trillion that the government hoped they would accept , but a tidy sum nonetheless . 
 The doubt now is over whether the banks will start tackling the real problem : their massive bad loans . Even by Japanese standards , the conditions attached to the bail - out are ambiguous . But , no question , they hugely favour the banks . With bank loans continuing to shrink - by an unprecedented 3.3 % year - on - year in October - the government had been talking about forcing the banks to lend some of its money out again . Now the conditions they have to meet to have access to the rescue cash are even softer than expected . So the banks are likely to use most of it to write down their bad debts instead . 
 The volume of these is staggering . James Fiorillo of ING Barings Securities , a Dutch investment bank , thinks that Japan 's 18 biggest banks have 41.4 trillion ( $ 345 billion ) of bad or doubtful loans between them . Assuming that they manage to recover onefifth of this , Mr Fiorillo reckons that , despite the provisions they have already made , they still need to set aside an additional Y19.5 trillion to cover their losses . That is more than triple the amount they have just requested from the government . Even Mr Fiorillo , an optimist among Tokyo 's hard - bitten bank analysts , thinks that the recapitalisation could drag on for another two to three years . 
 Nor , alas , is it clear what the government will get for its money . It is highly unlikely that the banks ' shareholders will have been punished in any way . Most of the money will probably be injected through purchases of preferred stock - a sort of cross between equity and debt , which in this case will look much more like debt than equity . The government will have no chance to convert it into bank shares - so it will gain nothing if the banks return to health . And the banks can pay it back when it suits them . That , says David Atkinson of Goldman Sachs , an American investment bank , makes the money , in effect , a low - interest loan , with few strings attached . 
 No mending of ways 
 Unfortunately , this leaves the banks with little incentive to press ahead with serious restructuring - branch closures , lay - offs , mergers and so on . Nor will it necessarily help the economy . For the government 's rescue funds to work , the banks must use them either to forgive some of their loans or to force the borrowers into bankruptcy , thus freeing up resources that could be put to better use .

BEIJING 
THOUGH he has become the world's most notorious splitter of semantic hairs, Bill Clinton is a mere amateur compared with the diplomats managing relations between China and Japan. They have been at it for decades now, and by the time China's president Jiang Zemin had concluded his visit to Japan this week were again spinning nuanced answers to seemingly straightforward questions. 
The hair-splitting was most excruciating when the questions concerned Taiwan. China's position-that the island is a wayward but inseparable part of its own sovereign territory-is, as Beijing likes to say, ""very clear and well known to all"". But does Japan recognise China's claim? This causes Chinese and Japanese diplomats to flip nervously through their briefing papers before waffling on into a careful reiteration of old statements and a firm reluctance to elaborate on what is, after all, intentionally vague language. 
Japan ""fully understands and respects"" China's claim to Taiwan. This, say Japanese officials, is not quite the same as recognising the claim (which the United States has done), but neither is it entirely different. As they say in Washington, it depends on what the meaning of""is"" is. 
Broaching another touchy topic during his official visit, the first by a Chinese head of state to Japan, Mr Jiang spoke frequently of Japan's aggression against China before and during the second world war. Japan's prime minister, Keizo Obuchi, uttered an apology along the lines of those offered to other countries. But the leaders failed to agree on the written apology that seemed to be in the offing just prior to the visit. This gave rise to yet another semantic quandary: does the apology really count if it is only oral? 
Some diplomats suggest that China would rather keep the issue simmering along indefinitely than get a decisive apology. Not only does the historical issue play well among nationalists at home, but it also resonates with other Asian nations that suffered from Japanese aggression. In the Chinese government's view, any future rise in Japan's importance would come at China's expense. Any reluctance by Tokyo to face squarely its own history is thus useful to China as proof that japan should not yet be allowed to spread its strategic wings by, for example, seeking a permanent seat on the United Nations Security Council. 
On the Taiwan issue, however, Beijing dearly wants movement. The subtle twist by which Japan was allowed to ""respect"" rather than ""recognise"" China's view of Taiwan was agreed in a 1g72 joint communique. At a moment when China was just starting to find its way out of self-imposed isolation, relations with Japan seemed more important than perfect ideological rectitude on the Taiwan issue. But China no longer accepts that sort of ambiguity from diplomatic suitors. When South Africa tried recently to finesse a similar compromise, it was rebuffed, and allowed to establish relations with Beijing only after fully accepting the Chinese line on Taiwan. 
Yet, however much Beijing may pressure it to update its Taiwan policy, Japan has good reasons for resisting. In addition to admiring Taiwan's democratic transformation (and appreciating its potential strategic importance in case of trouble with China), Japan has substantial economic ties with the island: two-way trade last year totalled $40 billion. 
Political and cultural ties, though entirely unofficial, are warm. Japan ruled Taiwan for 50 years, from 1895 until 1945, and-in striking contrast to its behaviour elsewhere in the area-it did so gently. As a result, Taiwanese share little of the anti-Japanese sentiment felt by mainland victims of Japanese aggression. Many in Taiwan, its president, Lee Teng-hui, among them, still speak Japanese and are proud to be associated with Japan. 
Yet Mr Jiang's visit did result in a raft of new agreements. These involved law enforcement, the environment, agriculture, industry, scientific and academic exchanges, and enhanced security dialogues. Indeed, the two sides formally upgraded their relationship to a ""friendly co-operative partnership"". But it was not made clear what, semantically, that will mean.

IT WAS their big chance. For months the leaders of South-East Asia's battered economies have proclaimed the need for concerted international action to help stop the rot. Yet a series of international gatherings, ranging from the annual meetings of the IMF and the World Bank to the Asia-Pacific Economic Co-operation forum, have yielded only a haphazard collection of grand schemes, backed up occasionally by warm wishes. In the minds of some of the region's leaders, all ofthese events have had a common flaw: the presence of hectoring western politicians and advisers who do not understand Asia's real problems. This week, it was the turn of leaders of the Association of South-East Asian Nations (ASEAN) to work out a recovery plan of their own at their annual meeting, this year held in Vietnam. Once again, however, they ended up largely empty-handed. 
The nine AsEAN members-Brunei, Indonesia, Laos, Malaysia, Myanmar, the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam-were divided on many issues, not least the admission of Cambodia, the region's only non-member, to their club. After a general election and a deal between Hun Sen, who had seized power in a coup, and his main rival, Cambodia is claiming to have a legitimate government. But some members, led by Singapore, wanted to see more evidence of political stability in Cambodia before it was admitted. So ASEAN declared that Cambodia was destined for membership, but would join at an unspecified date in the future. 
Enter Japan 
Decisions on economic issues turned into even more of a fudge. The most worthwhile plan was offered by yet another outsider: Japan. Arriving as one of several visiting participants, Keizo Obuchi, Japan's prime minister, at last filled in some of the details of his country's long-standing pledge to help the region's economies. Malaysia and Thailand will receive $1.85 billion each from the $30 billion rescue fund that Japan announced in December. The rest of the fund still has to be allocated, but Japan has promised money to Indonesia, the Philippines and South Korea; Vietnam has also asked for some. Although Mr Obuchi and his beneficiaries had not worked out exactly how the money should be spent, the Japanese prime minister was happy to pledge more money in the meantime, announcing an extra $5 billion for infrastructure projects throughout the region. 
As fuzzy as these plans are, they nevertheless represent a firm commitment compared with ASEAN's other endeavours. Although some of the battles were about initiatives within the region, the biggest divisions were over how the group should face outsiders. On one side of this debate is Mahathir Mohamad, Malaysia's prime minister. Dr Mahathir has delighted in picking fights with the IMF and others that have offered money only in exchange for stringent economic reforms. After defying IMF advice by bringing in currency controls for Malaysia last August, Dr Mahathir has set himself apart from countries such as Indonesia and Thailand, which have accepted conditional aid. Not only is he beset by political difficulties at home, including the controversial trial of his sacked finance minister, Anwar Ibrahim, but Dr Mahathir also faces the wrath of foreign investors and is anxious to attract some company before the misery arrives. 
Among the ideas Dr Mahathir would like ASEAN to consider are proposals for a common currency, or perhaps more use by ASEAN members of each other's currencies, to foster a sense of regional independence. He would also like other countries to adopt new regulations and capital controls designed explicitly to curb the influence of foreign traders. Although they were willing to look into such ideas, ASEAN's other members were not impressed. 
Thailand and Indonesia, for example, believe they have already paid the price for receiving help from the IMF by introducing tough reforms, and are now keen to receive the rest of their money without making too much fuss. Not only have their interest rates fallen and their currencies stabilised, but they have recently found it easier to persuade the IMF to relax its conditions. Thailand's most recent letter of intent to the IMF allows for a bigger budget deficit next year (5% of GDP) and does not include any specific timetable for making promised but painful changes to the bankruptcy law. For their part, Singapore and the Philippines, which have been less affected by the economic tribulations of the region and are continuing to open up their economies, are also wary of Dr Mahathir's ideas. That meant that Dr Mahathir's main supporter at the summit was communist Vietnam. 
Although not as exciting as a common currency or a regional bond market, the summit's more realistic discussions involved AsEAN's intra-regional efforts. These did not amount to much either. Attempts to speed up the abolition of tariffs on some goods produced a relatively harmless fudge. Although sooner would have been better, the region will continue with its existing efforts. The same is true of ASEAN's investment initiative, which will make it easier for direct investors from abroad to qualify for equal access throughout the region. The summit also produced several other pledges, such as one to allow the cross-listing of small firms' shares, that will remain just talk for now. 
Yet all this may turn out to be less discouraging than it seems. Although some onlookers worry that the lack of firm proposals will hurt confidence, the initiatives themselves matter little to the region's prospects of recovery. These depend largely on whatever reforms individual countries are making, as well as on the quality of their monetary and fiscal policies-and, of course, on luck. For ASEAN, the main issues are long-term: how eagerly will its members press for greater openness and co-operation in trade, investment and financial regulation? They may not have achieved much in Vietnam. But after a year of turmoil, economic suffering and nationalist cries for protection, at least South-East Asia's leaders did not turn back.

Big Mac index offers a guide to whether currencies are at their ""correct"" level. It is based on purchasing-power parity-the notion that an identical basket of goods and services should cost the same in all countries. The Big Mac PrP is the exchange rate that would leave hamburgers costing the same in America as abroad. The chart calculates the under- or overvaluation of emerging-market currencies against the dollar. Thus, dividing the local-currency price of a Big Mac in Malaysia by its American price produces a dollar ,pp of 1.63 ringgit. The actual dollar rate is 3.80 ringgit-ie, the currency is 57% undervalued. The other Asian currencies are also undervalued. At the other extreme, the currencies of Venezuela, Argentina and Israel are overvalued. The chart also shows that the yen is 9% undervalued against the dollar; the r-mark is 14% overvalued.  1999 2000 will be a year in which the world shifts its balance. America's magnificent economy will slow; Europe and Asia will pick up the slack. Overall, the world will increase its wealth by 3.5%: a fine achievement. For the third of our population that lives in China and India, prosperity will grow at twice the speed of the rich world, to all our benefit. It will be the first year in which the majority of people on the Internet do not speak English: in America the web will be used as much by women as men. The Internet will become the language of the world. There has never been a revolution of this speed. The marriage of mobile phones and the Internet will give it a new twist. 
Many of the gloomy predictions-and gloomy realities-of the 20th century will be happily left behind. So too, for a while, will be that greatest curse: war between nations. There will be conflicts as some nations break up-in Central Asia and perhaps in Western Sahara, after a referendum on independence in July. But no wars. To be cheerful about 2000 consider only this. Of the 30 major elections that will be held, 16 will be in countries that 25 years ago were dictatorships. There will be four elections to watch. In March, Taiwan will hold an open and free vote; it will expose as humbugs all those Asian autocrats who hold that the East requires a Confucian and necessarily authoritarian (or corrupt) way of government. In July, the Russians go to the polls: an exercise that will prove the futility of democracy at the ballot box without a rule of law in the land. Russia's misery will continue. Look to Mexico on July 2nd. A country that has been a byword for cruelty, chaos and privilege is, not before time, to hold genuinely free elections in a society that is, piecemeal, equally genuinely reforming itself. And on November 7th, there is America's election. Months of scrutiny and campaigning and expense will produce two nearly identical candidates, each of whom will have his views carefully honed to a meaningless average. But lucky America to have evolved a system where leadership leaves its dogmas aside at the winning post. Note that whoever is elected-Democrat or Republican-will be a highly educated man. America's system is easily mocked but it does not produce fools. 
2000 will be a good year for Britain. Its economy will grow rapidly, one of Europe's star performers yet again. This trajectory means that Britain's wealth may overtake that of France for the first time in nearly 50 years. Britain's new-found prosperity comes from its trade with fellow Europeans. It will be a depressing oddity that, for yet another year, public debate in Britain will be dominated by animosity towards its neighbours. Elsewhere nationalism will be healthily relegated to sport. Watch out for the Olympics that start in Sydney in September, if you miss the old tribal certainties of fluttering flags and swelling pride in the home team. 
The World an 2000 is printed in Britain and America. It will appear in 16 languages from Japanese to Greek. Its mistakes, therefore, will be widely disseminated. I hope those things about it that are accurate or entertaining will also be well read and enjoyed. 
Dudley Fishburn  1999 Elections to the White House and the Kremlin will hold the world spellbound, predicts John Parker. Each will produce a marginal improvement. 
In July Russia will elect a new president. On November 7th America will do likewise. These elections mark the passage from the first to the second generation of post-cold war leaders. The two votes could hardly seem more different. One is taking place after eight years of unparalleled economic boom in a country where voters are mostly satisfied with the institutions of state. The other comes after eight years of unparalleled bust in a country where almost every state institution is in crisis. 
Nevertheless, there are links, and revealing ones. Both Bill Clinton and Boris Yeltsin have concentrated on their domestic economies, when they could. Both are ending their presidencies in scandal and disgrace. In both cases, their successors will have to inch their way towards a new international engagement. 
Russia's election is the more uncertain and the more constrained. Whoever wins will want to be a vigorous new broom: more interventionist at home, more aggressive abroad, harder to deal with all round. But at the same time, he will be hamstrung by Russia's enfeebled system of government, its corrupted economy and the calamitous condition of its armed forces. In practice, therefore, the year will see a struggle between the assertive ambitions of the new president and the ruinous realities of the country. This will be unnerving for everyone, Russians most of all. 
The American election is less explosively disruptive. 2000's election is exceptionally open. There is a chance that all three elected institutions of government might change hands. That has not been true for generations. Despite the years of prosperity, the presidential race will be close-far closer than appears from opinion polls. But Republicans have captured seven of the past 12 presidential elections. With the Democrat administration tainted by scandal, they are better placed to win back the White House than any time since 1980: the race is George W Bush's to lose. 
The House of Representatives is also likely to change hands. The Republicans' popularity is abysmal. They are defending the narrowest majority since 1951 (six seats)-and there are at least 30 close races. The Senate, where the Republicans have a majority of ten and are defending only half a dozen open seats, is less likely to change hands. But even here, a strong swing towards the Democrats would be enough to change control. In short, you could have almost any combination of outcomes: a continuation of the current division of government (Democratic president, Republican Congress); the mirror image; or unified government under either party. And as if that were not enough, it is unlikely that anyone will win well enough to dominate either chamber. This leads to the firm prediction that there will be more of the sort of gridlock that has characterised American government for the past few years. This need not be a weakness. There are no urgent matters in American life that require political solutions or sustained leadership. And the American public is too diverse, too splendidly kaleidescopic, to be led by some political or moral dogma, as the Republican right is learning to its cost. (Russia, by contrast, could well fall far such a shallow appeal.) 
The recent huge surpluses on the federal budget have fundamentally altered American politics: they mean there are no dire economic consequences from failure to agree on spending measures. All that happens as a result of gridlock is that the national debt is repaid faster-a desirable outcome. At home, gridlock matters little. But abroad, it matters more. The next ten years are likely to be a time of greater international instability than the past ten. The new Russian president is one reason for that, Chinese assertiveness another, nuclear proliferation a third. Then there is the unending rash of small conflicts that will require American attention and perhaps military intervention. While there is a broad public consensus that the United States should exercise some sort of leadership role in the world, there is no agreement on individual hard cases. This means the new president will face tougher choices, without a popular mandate for any particular action and, very possibly, without much support in Congress. There would be every reason to lament this muddle if the past ten years had not shown that a muddled America can still act swiftly and benevolently-something that will be long denied to a corrupt and bankrupt Russia, whoever its leader might be.  1999 America's slowdown will need to be balanced by growth elsewhere. Financial markets are unprepared for this, warns Clive Crook. 
Not for many years has the fortune of the world's biggest economy seemed so detached from conditions elsewhere. The United States continues to roar along. Early in 2000 it will set a new record for its longest uninterrupted economic expansion. You might have expected this breathless growth to help other countries: when America works up a sweat, as it were, the rest of the world gets a fever. Not this time. Europe, Japan and much of the third world have been growing only slowly of late. The global economy is weirdly out of joint. 
In the coming months this growth imbalance will start to be corrected. One thing is as clear as anything can be in the economic predictions business: the American expansion is going to cool. What is unclear is how abrupt the slowdown will be, and whether it will be offset by faster growth in the rest of the world. Could the braking be so severe as to drag the world back into recession? The odds are against it-but the risk is not to be dismissed. 
To many American economic commentators, this will seem a much-too-gloomy assessment. The recent mood in the United States has been triumphant, and understandably so. Growth in 1999 as a whole will come in at close to 4%, which is remarkable in the eighth year of expansion. But that is not the best of it. After nearly a decade of growth, the unemployment rate has fallen to barely 4%-yet there is no obvious sign, so far, of rising inflation. Many analysts suppose that this stunning performance will continue indefinitely. This year Wall Street raised its valuations of American corporations to levels that make sense only on that very assumption. The old rules say this cannot be right. Of course they do, reply the optimists, but the old rules no longer hold: the revolutions in computing and telecommunications have repealed them. 
Even if such exuberance is justified, the view that growth in America can continue for ever at its present rate is foolish. Suppose that the ""new economy"" is real; suppose that the long-term trend of growth in productivity is markedly steeper than before, thanks to advancing technology. Even this would be too little to sustain the American miracle. The reason is that inflation in the United States has been suppressed in the past couple of years by temporary factors-by those useful imbalances in the world economy, in fact. 
Europe's turn 
Slow growth in Europe and severe recessions in much of the third world have been a blessing in disguise for the United States. They created global spare capacity, pressing down on prices. Oil and other commodities have been dirt-cheap for most of the past two years, reducing consumer-price inflation in America by as much as a full percentage point a year during 1996-98. And sluggish demand outside the United States has also enabled America to finance its current-account deficit (reflecting its excess of investment over saving) at low interest rates and without a depreciation in the dollar. 
Now that demand is picking up in Europe and Asia, both of these special price-suppressing factors will fade: the cost of inputs will rise, and financing the deficit is going to call for higher interest rates or a lower dollar, either of which will push prices up. This is to say nothing of pressure for higher wages, which is also sure to mount (at the present very low rate of unemployment) unless growth cools. So if the economy fails to slow spontaneously, inflation will start to climb; and if inflation starts to climb, the Federal Reserve will have to brake the economy deliberately by raising interest rates. 
For these reasons, American growth will need to slow soon even if the ""new economy"" is real. Nonetheless, the more truth there is to the view that productivity growth has improved, the milder this slowdown will need to be. If the optimists are right about the new supply-side revolution, a soft landing both for the economy and for Wall Street is a pretty safe bet. The trouble is, the evidence so far suggests they are wrong. Growth in American labour productivity has improved in the past two years, as the optimists never tire of pointing outbut this improvement has been entirely concentrated, so far at least, in one small sub-sector of the economy (namely, rc manufacturing). Perhaps productivity growth will improve across the board in the years to come: it has not done so yet. 
This has two disturbing implications. The first is that the slowdown necessary to avoid inflation breaking out in the United States in 2000 will be noticeably large. The most recent iMa forecasts (which do in fact allow for some modest supply-side improvement) show growth slowing by more than a full percentage point, to 2.6%; even so, inflation drifts gently upwards. As it stands, that looks like a soft landing-though Wall Street in its present mood might find it something of a shock. Which brings us to the second worrying implication. If the new economy is a mirage, or anyway much less real than it has been made out to be, then present stockmarket valuations of American companies are indefensible. Once you combine the need for a cooling of aggregate demand with a stockmarket that is both overvalued and seemingly unprepared for even the mildest disappointment, you have the necessary ingredients for a much less graceful touchdown. 
In the past year, the world economy has had a lucky escape, and America's magnificent economy deserves the credit. As economies flagged around the globe, America kept the wheels of global commerce turning. Now a grand rebalancing is needed. If the world's luck holds, the coming year will see gently slower growth in America, a curbing of passions on Wall Street (but no crash), all combined with increasing strength in Europe, Japan and the emerging markets. It could happen-but don't bet more than you can afford to lose.  1999 Muslims will in the 2000s demand and win the freedom that their leaders have long denied them, predicts Brian Beedham. 
With fingers only lightly crossed, it is possible at the close of the 1990s to hope that the decade's biggest geopolitical ogre can now be laid to rest. Since the end of the cold war, with a ruined Russia and a China that still does not quite know what it wants to do in the world, too many people have been willing to believe that the next great danger to global peace and freedom would be the rise of a ferocious new Islamic superpower. As things stand, that looks increasingly unlikely. 
The two major Muslim countries where revolutionary Islam had seemed most dangerous, Iran and Algeria, are in different ways-one much better than the other-probably at last getting it under control. Even in remoter patches of chaos such as Sudan and Afghanistan things no longer look quite as bad as they once did. And, tighten those crossed fingers, quite a few Muslim countries have lately been making their first hesitant experiments with the idea of democracy. 
In Iran, once thought of as the epicentre of the clerical earthquake, something new is happening. A relatively free election in 1997 gave the Iranian presidency, by an overwhelming majority, to the liberal Muhammad Khatami. The ""supreme leader"" who stands above the president, the veteran Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, then proved much less intransigent than had been expected. The ayatollah has helped to get Iran back on speaking terms with much of the Arab world and with Europe, and has let President Khatami extend at least a tentative hand of reconciliation towards America. 
The struggle in Iran is not over. Ayatollah Khamenei remains more conservative than President Khatami; liberal newspapers can still get shut down; February's parliamentary election will show whether Iranians can vote as freely in 2000 as they did in 1997. Yet something has changed in the past few years. A middle ground has opened up between the most unbending of Iran's religious fanatics and the irreconcilables at the other end of the ideological spectrum. 
Something similar has happened in Algeria, though in a different way and far more Moodily. The savage civil war which began in 1992, when the army insisted on cancelling an election that a relatively moderate Islamist party looked like winning, seems to be grinding to a close. The army has more or less got on top of the brutally extremist guerrillas the war inevitably created. But the army, or at least its better part, has also been shaken by the war-by the huge casualty list, by the atrocities its own men have committed, by the damage done to the economy, and by the disapproving stares of Algeria's neighbours in Europe. The generals have therefore decided to let the politicians begin a dialogue with the more flexible Islamists the army had spurned in 1992. 
There are new flickers of light in other dark corners. Sudan's Islamists have suddenly accepted the principle of a free press, and have sent a small smile towards the country's exiled opposition. Even the Taliban regime in Afghanistan-the fundamentalists so narrow-minded that even the other fundamentalists noticed-shows some signs of rational thinking. 
The improvement is not confined to the parts of the Muslim world run by religious zealots. There are signs that Jordan and Morocco may grow more liberal under their young new kings; in the Gulf, little Kuwait, Qatar and Oman are letting more people vote, and vote more freely, in their elections; and on the other side of the globe huge Indonesia is currently digesting the consequences of its first real attempt at letting the people choose who will govern them. 
Add what may be the most telling fact of all-that the countries of the Muslim world, even the single-- language Arab part of it, have made virtually no progress towards real political solidarity over the past 50 years-and that nightmare of a pugnacious new Muslim superpower can be seen for what it is: the sort of bad dream you wake up from, shaking a puzzled head. 
The reality is less frightening than the dream for two reasons. The first is that ""the Muslim world"", though united by more or less the same religious beliefs, is otherwise divided into a dozen separate cultures and sub-cultures. Arabs are different from Turks, Turks from Persians, Persians from Pathans, Pathans from Punjabis, Punjabis from Bengalis, Bengalis from Malays and the Muslims of Indonesia. Even the 22 countries that share the Arabic language remain distinct political entities, held apart by disruptive variations of economics and history and by their rulers' desire to keep a grip on local power. It will never be easy to construct a potent international force out of so loose a club. 
The other part of the explanation will make it even harder. Like everybody else, today's inhabitants of all these assorted countries know far more about the rest of the world than their parents did, thanks to the electronics revolution of the late 20th century. The effects are an awkward mixture of envy and distaste; but for most Muslims, poor and unfree, the envy will probably be the stronger. They will increasingly want a richer and freer future than is likely to be provided either by religious puritans or by corrupt army-backed dictators. 
Until now, few Muslims have been able to use their individual judgment about anything. Except for the handful recently made rich by oil, most of them have always lived in rural or pastoral poverty; being poor, they have been easily kept under the heel of dictatorial rulers; above all, the interpretation of Islam-of God's will-has long been the monopoly of a handful of selfselected wise men who believed they knew what others should think and do. 
Now, the economics of the modern world offers an escape from poverty. One group of Islamic revivalists is urging that all good Muslims should have an equal voice in the interpretation of God's will. If individual judgment can be used in religion, it will surely be used in politics too. The same sort of change, for rather similar reasons, began in the Christian world half a millennium ago. Look forward to a Muslim Reformation. 
Brian Beedham: associate editor, The Economist.  1999 The British economy may soon overtake the French, for the first time in a generation, predicts John Grimond. Don't take it too seriously. 
Few rivalries provide as much entertainment for onlookers as that between France and Britain, or rather between their peoples, the Frogs and the Rosbifs. They do not hate each other, as some neighbours do. But nor do they love each other. Each admires certain features of the other: cuisine, chic, paysage on the one hand; dogs, literature, phlegm on the other. But the qualities they respect in each other are far outweighed by those they despise. 
And hence their rivalry, a rivalry made all the more intense by what the two countries have in common: a similar sense of nationhood, a similar proud history, a similar claim to a role on the world stage, a similar diminution of that role, a similar size of population and a similar size of economy. It is this economic similarity that will ere long excite feelings of superiority (among the Brits), derision (among the French) and perhaps amusement (among others): some time in the not-toodistant future, headlines in British newspapers will triumphantly proclaim that Britain's gross domestic product has overtaken France's. 
The claim will be phoney, but never mind, it will have numbers to support it. They will show that when the value of French GDP, measured in euros, is converted into dollars, it is smaller than that of Britain's GDP, measured in pounds and then also converted into dollars. Calculated this way, the two economies are indeed about the same size already: France's GDP was $1.4 trillion in 1998, Britain's $1.37 trillion. Though the French economy has been growing nicely in 1999, at about 2.3%, and is set to do even better in 2000, the euro has been weak and the pound strong. 
The British newspapers that will trumpet Britain's new economic prowess most loudly will be those that also fulminate against the Eu and especially its latest piece of ""integrationist lunacy"", the single currency. Yet if the claim that Britain's economy has overtaken France's can be made at all-and it should be pointed out that, in the foreign-exchange markets, no future event can ever be considered certain-then it will be a claim that can be made only because of the euro. In other words, had it not been for horrible economic and monetary union (so ruthlessly promoted by the diabolical Frenchman, Jacques Delors, when he ran the European Commission), Britain's economy would still be unambiguously behind France's. 
That is where it is, on any sensible reckoning, and where it is likely to stay, at least for a while. To compare economies by valuing them at market exchange rates can give an utterly misleading picture. Exchange rates vary wildly, and are influenced by factors such as interest rates, capital transfers, government policy and so on, not merely by pure international trade. That is why inter-country comparisons are usually based on the concent of purchasing-power parity, which values currenties in terms of how much is required to buy an identical basket of goods and services in the countries concerned. On this reckoning, the British economy (at $1.30 trillion in 1999) is about 4.5% smaller than the French one ($1.37 trillion). 
However, even this calculation may well be inaccurate. In all countries, plenty of economic activity, from building and baby-sitting to prostitution and drug-dealing, goes unrecorded. It is conceivable that, if all of this were taken into account, Britain's economy might turn out to be genuinely bigger than France's. 
Conceivable but unlikely. It is widely believed that it was a decision to include the underground economy in the official figures that lay behind il sorpasso, Italy's celebrated, yet shortlived, overtaking of Britain back in 1987. But the underground economy is almost certain to be larger in a highly taxed and highly regulated country, such as France, than in a laisser faire country such as Britain. 
But does size matter? Since the two countries' populations are virtually the same-France's is smaller by less than half a million people, unless the overseas departments are included-a bigger economy means bigger GnP per person, so the French are, on average, richer than the Brits. This will not come as a surprise to the millions of Britons who go to France for their holidays each year. They may not be able to see that the French have more telephones and more washing-machines, or even that they have lower infant mortality and deaths from cancer. But they can hardly help but notice that the French have swankier clothes, smarter trains and proportionately more cars. Competitive Brits may, however, take comfort from the latest Human Development Report issued by the United Nations. In 1999, its annual ""human development index"" put Britain ahead of France for the first time. So there.  1999 The Spanish-speaking world is acquiring a style, sophistication and influence that, says Daniel Franklin, will affect all our lives. 
Starting in 2000, would-be American presidents will be at a dangerous disadvantage unless they can appeal to voters in Spanish as well as in English. Hispanic-Americans are growing rapidly not only in numbers (31m and rising) but in confidence and clout as well. Beyond the United States, too, the Spanish-speaking world, which extends across more than 20 countries in three continents and includes over 350m people, is set to become a force to be reckoned with once again. Prepare for a new breed of cultural and commercial conquistadors. 
This may sound implausible to those who have come to take inexorable Anglo-Saxon pre-eminence for granted. A crude but credible view of the Hispanic world's history is that, after Spain's imperial power peaked, it has been downhill for much of the past 400 years. As the Spanish-speaking world's influence declined, that of the English-speaking world rose, carried ever higher first by the British empire and then by America. Even now, it would be easy to look at the troubles of Latin America and conclude that it is too early to talk of a turn in fortunes. You will see guerrilla insurgency (Colombia), debt default (Ecuador) and economic recession (much of South America). Swathes of Spanish-speaking countries are still desperately poor and plagued by high crime. In too many of them, scant regard for the rule of law holds back development. 
Yet look again, and you will see that many of the pieces are in place for a powerful Hispanic resurgence. One of the pieces is democracy. All but one of the Spanish-speaking countries are now democracies of sorts, the exception being Fidel Castro's Cuba. Democracy, of course, is no guarantee of good government. But it is an improvement on dictatorship. The countries with the deepest democratic roots, from Chile to Costa Rica, tend to have the strongest civil institutions. 
Next, there is trade. The inward-looking, import-substituting model of economic development having failed, Latin Americans have sensibly abandoned it. They have opted instead to open markets and enter into trade-liberalising agreements, whether with one another (Mercosur, the Andean Community, the Central American Common Market) or, in Mexico's case, with its North American neighbours. Thanks to the North American Free Trade Agreement, Mexico's economy has boomed with America's. 
Hip, hip, Hispanidad 
In the United States itself, it is demography that is giving Latinos a lift. By 2050 the country's Hispanics may number as many as 100m, perhaps a quarter of the population (compared with 11% now). Today's Latinos are young and proud of their roots. All of a sudden, Hispanic is hip, from musica to movies, from la vida Iota to Jennifer Lopez and Salma Hayek. The influence is spreading beyond the obvious Spanish-speaking areas: hence the popularity of salsa clubs across Europe and the enthusiastic crowds for Ricky Martin in London. An upwardly mobile ""Generation N"" (the Latin equivalent of Generation X), which was invented and copyrighted by a Miami entrepreneur, is starting to flex its muscles. 
The final piece of the puzzle lies across the Atlantic. Since the end of the Francoist dictatorship in 1975, Spain, too, has swapped dictatorship for democracy and opened itself to the world through its memberships of NATO and the Eu. It is reaping the rewards. A foundermember of the single currency, it is now in Europe's super-league, gaining in wealth, weight and prestige. The centuries-long downward trend in Spanish fortunes has turned sharply upwards. Newly confident, Spaniards are increasingly looking not just to Europe but beyond, to Spain's former colonies. 
All this creates a potent mix for Hispanidad. Companies can expand their horizons across the continents. There will be a growing number of Spanish-accented multinationals, both spreading from Spain (like Telefonica, a telecoms giant, Repsol, an oil company, and Banco Santander Central Hispano) and from Latin America (like Mexico's Cemex). Publishers and Internet adventurers will flock to exploit an increasingly enticing Spanish-speaking market. Spanish speakers themselves will start to wallow in the attention and spread their influence far and wide-through trade, music, family values, and Spanglish words that enter into common usage-like true children of Columbus.

Compiled in association with The Economist eCalendar Companion. Software to personalise your electronic diary. wvu.bookshop.economist.com  1999 On Tuesday November 7th, America will probably follow Mae West's dictum: ""When forced to choose between two evils, I pick the one I have not tried before."" A full year of campaigning, in which none of the serious protagonists is anything but decent, responsible and colourless, will have left American democracy dull but in good shape. America's tedium will be the world's respect. 
Two parts of the American system, however, are going seriously wrong. First, despite all the hoopla, only around half of America's population will vote (compared with 72% in British and 95% in Australian elections). The winner will be lucky to have the backing of 25% of the public, and so will have no firm mandate. When the electorate is so little involved it is no wonder that new presidents enjoy so little popular loyalty or goodwill. 
Second, the election will produce, once again, a Congress that will soon find itself at odds with the White House. A recent poll showed that only 14% of the electorate wanted a divided government. The 2000 elections definitely give voters the opportunity to try a new arrangement: to have both the White House and Capitol Hill in the hands of the same party. Control of Congress is up for grabs. In the House, the 26-seat Republican majority installed in 1994 has dwindled to just five. In the Senate, Republicans have held a 55-45 advantage since 1994 and are favoured to retain control, but Democrats have at least a mathematical chance to take over. Yet these numbers disguise the truth: Capitol Hill has evolved into an institution that can define itself only through its arguments with the White House, regardless of which party has nominal control. 
Not so the Supreme Court, where change is also afoot. Three of the justices are over 70-Chief Justice William Rehnquist and Justices John Paul Stevens and Sandra Day O'Connor. With a fourth, Ruth Bader Ginsburg, having undergone surgery for cancer, the prospects are that the next president will be able substantially to reshape the judiciary. More than 70 other federal judgeships are vacant and unlikely to be filled before 2001 owing to conflicts between the president, who nominates judges, and the Republican Senate, which must confirm them. (The political hijacking of the appointment process is another troubled element in the constitution that needs sorting out.) 
The presidential election campaign has been under way for most of 1999 owing to the decision of several states to move their primary elections to the early months of 2000. A majority of the delegates to both national conventions will be selected by March 15th. 
Among Republicans, it would take a cosmological intervention to deprive George W Bush of the nomination. He is 30 points ahead of any rival in national opinion polls. He has the support of a majority of his fellow Republican governors and of members of Congress. And he has collected three times as much in campaign contributions as his nearest rival, billionaire magazine publisher, Steve Forbes. The only suspense on the Republican side is whether Mr Bush will somehow stumble. 
The Democratic contest, on the other hand, has become intense, with the front-runner, Vice-President Al Gore, strongly challenged by a former senator, Bill Bradley of New Jersey. Mr Gore is both blessed and cursed by his eight years as Bill Clinton's loyal vice-president. He is blessed because he has cemented ties with powerful Democratic interest groups, because Mr Clinton will use the powers of his office to help him and because, if the American economy stays strong, Mr Gore will be seen as part of a winning team. 
But Mr Gore is cursed by the fact that the Clinton presidency has been stained by multiple scandals. The public seems anxious to move on to cleaner pastures. As the joke goes, ""After Clinton, the United States wants to take a shower, and poor Al Gore is going down the drain."" Mr Bradley, a former professional basketball player who spent 18 years in the Senate, has based his challenge to Mr Gore on two arguments: that he is not an ""inside"" politician and that he will address problems-child poverty, the 45m who lack health insurance-that he alleges the Clinton-Gore administration has neglected. 
Despite Mr Bradley's progress, Mr Gore retains institutional advantages in the nomination struggle. It will take 2,189 delegate votes at the August Democratic National Convention in Los Angeles to win. The party reserves 18% of those ballots for ""super-delegates""-governors, members of Congress and members of the Democratic National Committee, who are free to vote as they wish. They are overwhelmingly in Mr Gore's camp. The other 80% are awarded according to state primary results. 
Along with the presidency, separate races will be under way for House and Senate seats. (Watch out for Hillary Clinton's run for the New York Senate seat.) Congressional Democrats, with help from the White House, have paid almost exclusive attention to winning back control of the House by framing issues, raising money and recruiting candidates. The most contentious issues arise from the inability of a divided government to pass major items on the national agenda-Social Security and Medicare reform, tax reductions, gun control or patients' rights legislation. 
There will be two other important twists to look for in the 2000 elections. First, the governors and state legislators in office over the next few years will redraw electoral boundaries in the wake of the decennial census, possibly handing an advantage to one party or another for the next decade. Second, these elections will be the first in the world in which the Internet will play a crucial part. All the tricks of democracy-from policy initiatives to character assassination-will move on to the net.  1999 For the past couple of years, America's economy has basked in luck. It has grown robustly, while a combination of low commodity prices and a strong dollar have kept inflation out of sight. Foreigners' willingness to pour capital into America has funded the spending spree. In 2000 this luck will be severely tested, since the economy is beset with two big weaknesses: stock prices are too high and savings are too low. These problems pose a nasty threat to the country's nineyear expansion. A market crash would leave bubbly consumers feeling suddenly less wealthy: spending would plummet, and so would the economy. 
The fear of that kind of ""hard landing"" will give rise to some anxious moments in 2000. But although the economy will slow from a gallop to a trot, and although the stockmarket and the dollar will show some humility, the chances are that America's luck will hold. There will be no Armageddon on Wall Street, no dramatic dollar crisis, no collapse of consumer spending, and certainly no recession. Unless Alan Greenspan, chairman of the Federal Reserve, makes some grave errors, America's economy has every chance of achieving a ""soft landing"" as it slows to a more sustainable pace. 
Two related factors will force a slowdown from the near record growth rates that have been the recent norm: foreigners and fears of inflation. Foreigners have been bankrolling America's recent spending spree. While the rest of the world looked in turmoil, investors were happy to pour their money into America's booming markets. As a result, the country's current-account deficit-which reflects the difference between how much America saves and invests, and is funded by capital inflows from foreigners-has ballooned. 
In 2000, this deficit will reach nearly $400 billion, or 4% Of GDP, a record level, higher than that of the Reagan boom of the mid-1980s. However, after 2000 the current-account deficit will slowly fall. Foreigners will see improving opportunities for their cash elsewhere in Japan and Europe, and they will worry that America is using their capital to finance low savings rather than booming investment. As a result, they will start to shift their money elsewhere. Scarcer capital in America will mean higher interest rates; growth will slow. 
America's mind-boggling consumer spending (which has jumped by an average of 5% in 1998 and 1999) has been fuelled by a huge fall in personal savings. As their stock portfolios have fattened, Americans have felt wealthier and saved less. In 1993 households saved around 7% of their disposable income. By 1999 the figure was barely above 2%. Were this decline to continue, Americans would soon be spending more than their disposable income. Clearly this trend is unsustainable, which is why 2000 will see much slower growth in spending, thus slowing overall growth some more. 
As foreigners shift their money to other economies, the dollar will fall. A weaker dollar will boost America's exports (export volumes could grow by over 8% in 2000, more than twice as Fast as 1999). Import growth will slow, as foreign-made products become relatively more expensive in dollars. But a weaker dollar will also aggravate fears of inflationary pressure, which will be rising anyway for other reasons. 
The spectacularly benign performance of prices-consumer-price inflation is near 30-year lows despite booming demand-has a variety of causes. In part it is due to increases in the productivity of American workers; in part it is the result of lucky breaks such as falling commodity prices and the strong dollar. But the dollar's weakness in 2000 will carry the threat of higher prices in the shops; so too will higher commodity prices. At the same time, the cost of labour may pick up. By early 2000 the unemployment rate will be pushed below 4% and the scarcity of workers will eventually push hourly wages upwards. 
If inflation suddenly accelerates, the Federal Reserve will have to raise interest rates sharply, popping the bubble on Wall Street and bringing about the hard landing that investors fear. But the likelihood is otherwise. 
Even so, tight labour markets, a weaker dollar and firmer commodity prices will prompt the Federal Reserve to tighten short-term interest rates modestly. The result will be higher costs for borrowers throughout the economy. This in turn will trigger a gentle slowing in spending and investment, together with a modest and overdue correction to the excessive prices on Wall Street. And yet, even as America slows down, American triumphalism will remain undented. By accomplishing a soft landing, America will have pulled off a miracle as remarkable as the past years of unbroken growth. 
Zanny Minton-Beddoes: Washington correspondent. The Economist. 
United Nations subscriptions go up for Japan and down for America, though it still owes $1.2 billion. Is Uncle Sam world policeman or a free-rider?  1999 America's pockets will feel the weight of change in the early months of 2000, when a new dollar coin is placed in circulation. The coin, which is set to replace the rarely seen Susan B. Anthony dollar, will once again be graced by the figure of a woman. Unlike her predecessor she'll be a native American. On the obverse side of the coin will be the figure of Sacagawea, the Shoshone teenage mother who travelled from the Northern Great Plains to the Pacific Ocean with the Lewis and Clark expedition of 1805. Strapped to her back will be her son, Jean-Baptiste. The design marks a radical departure from the harsh profiles of previous American presidents. Despite the failure of the Susan B. Anthony coin, which remains in use only for vending machines, the us mint is confident that the Sacagawea coin will succeed. With its distinctive gold colouring and smooth edge, it is expected to be popular in the pocket. It will not be possible to confuse it, as the Susan B. Anthony coin could be, with the nickel. And there is a widespread feeling that the single dollar bill has become too bulky and difficult to pocket. Its face value is too low for a paper note. Few other wealthy countries have such small units of currency expressed in paper. So, does this mean the demise of the dollar bill? The government certainly intends to give wide circulation to the new coin as it will cost less to maintain and will last longer than the paper note. This time the betting is that the dollar coin will take hold. While in this reforming mood, how long will it be before the one-cent coin is phased out?  1999 In 1790, the United States became the first modern nation to undertake a comprehensive count of its population as a routine responsibility of government. The constitutionally mandated decennial census was part and parcel of a revolutionary concept in government. If the new nation's democratically elected governments were to be truly representative of the people, then the government itself would have to make regular efforts to determine just how many of those people there were. 
Whereas the Senate was established to represent the interests of the states, the House of Representatives was designed to represent the interests of individuals. The Constitution dictates that every decade a census be used to apportion representatives among the states according to the relative size of their populations. 
From the very beginning, the American nation has been characterised by rapid population growth and movement. Hence the census has as much to do with political power shifts as it does with population shifts. With so much at stake, the census has always been a magnet for controversy. George Washington was unhappy with the first ever count of the American people. (He thought that it was too low.) True to tradition, the 2000 census, which will be conducted on April 1st, will be greeted with grumbling from all sides. 
Indeed, over the past few years the 2000 census has been shaping up as the most contentious since 1920, when rural lawmakers refused to reapportion House seats based on data showing that more Americans lived in cities than in the countryside. On the surface, contemporary Democrats and Republicans have been fighting over methodology: whether the Census Bureau should employ sophisticated statistical sampling techniques or an old-fashioned head count. 
But the real battle has been over who will be counted. Despite its $2.6 billion price tag, the 1990 census was a debacle, leaving an estimated 10m people uncounted, many of them members of Democratic-leaning minority groups. To avoid repeating such a massive undercount in 2000, the Census Bureau had been advocating the use of sampling-a process whereby 90% of people are physically counted and the remaining 10% are statistically inferred. Hoping a higher tally of minorities would help them create new friendly political constituencies, the Democrats championed the bureau's cause, but to no avail. 
Citing the Constitution-and not so secretly wishing for another undercount-the Republicans opposed sampling. They demanded the actual (and perhaps impossible) enumeration of every person in the country. A former House Speaker, Newt Gingrich, went as far as to call sampling a ""dagger pointed at the heart"" of the Republican majority and filed suit against the government to stop it. The Supreme Court ruled in his favour and ordered the Census Bureau to conduct a traditional enumeration. 
Therefore it is a foregone conclusion that the 2000 census will vastly undercount the American people. Despite a scheduled $100m national ad campaign to ""make everyone count"", Americans of all stripes will duck census counters out of a distrust of government and a growing concern for privacy. 
The variety of recent immigrants means that language barriers will pose significant challenges to the Census Bureau in 2000. Nonetheless, the new data will reveal a nation that is becoming more racially and ethnically complex than ever before. In the 2000 census, America will be more heavily Latino than it was in 1990. And in part due to the anti-immigrant fervour in the first half of the decade, more immigrants will be naturalised American citizens than ten years before. 
Yet, even while documenting the diversification of the American people, the 2000 census will also mark the beginning of the end of America's archaic official racial accounting scheme. 
In 2000, for the first time, Americans will be able to identify themselves as multiracial. While not necessarily the best solution, the Census Bureau will nonetheless allow respondents to tick any or all of the four primary racial boxes: African-American, white, Asian/Pacific Islander, or American Indian/Alaska Native. In the past, the Census asked respondents to pick only one of the above categories. (Hispanic remains a separate ethnic-and non-racial-classification.) 
The multiple-race option came after three years of emotional public debate between multiracial activists and traditional minority civil-rights groups. The Clinton administration rejected a proposed self standing ""multiracial"" category that would have included all people of mixed racial background. 
Lobbied hard by ethnic advocacy groups that feared the diminishment of their constituencies if a multiracial category had been approved, the White House stumbled on the multiple race option as a political compromise. Census 2000 will acknowledge multiracial Americans even while upholding the old classifications. 
However modest, the change in rules will affect policies like affirmative action or the drawing of minority legislative districts. But the most long-lasting consequence of the new census form is likely to be administrative confusion. It is not at all clear how the multiracial data will ultimately be used. Will the daughter of an African-American father and a white mother be considered black when state legislatures are attempting to forge black-dominant political districts? And what about a citizen who says he is a combination of black, Asian, and white? Will the government consider him all or none of the above? 
Despite the steady increase in Asian immigration to the United States, the 2000 census might very well count fewer Asian-Americans than in 1990. In a 1996 test run, 30% of Asian-American respondents identified themselves as multiracial. 
And although the Census Bureau does not expect many Americans to tick more than one box in 2000-past policy has encouraged people to choose one heritage over the other-multiracial Americans will increasingly make their presence felt. Since 1970, the population of multiracial children has quadrupled in the United States. Between 1960 and 1990, the number of once-illegal unions between races increased 900%. In contemporary California, one in every six births is a mixed-race child. However flawed, the 2000 census will officially mark America's new found freedom not just to acknowledge its past, but also its future heritage.

Imagine: planes flying above cities beaming down radio, video and data communications. Experiments begin in 2000 that might give satellites a run for their money.  1999 Yachting's grandest trophy, the America's Cup, will be up for grabs in a series of nine races off New Zealand starting on February 19th. This cup always brings out wallets, egos, national pride, skulduggery and skill. Just to enter you have to post a $250,000 bond. But this is nothing compared with the cost of developing a yacht and professional team, which is upwards of $35m. Yet no less than 11 syndicates will have their keels in the water, representing six countries: France, Italy, Japan, Spain, Switzerland and the United States. (Note the shameful absence of Britain, which founded the competition in 1851 but then repeatedly lost it.) The cup has been won away from the United States only twice, the first time in 1983 by Australia and the second time by New Zealand in 1995.  1999 Americans will reach deep into their pockets in 2000 and give $200 billion to charity. This will not just be an unprecedented amount; it will be more than all the other 5.8 billion citizens of the world put together will donate. Britain, which does not think of itself as a mean-spirited country, will give just over 44 billion ($6.4 billion). 
Americans give to charity for many reasons. The first and foremost of them is that they are a generous and civic-minded people-words that many other countries find hard to say. There are secondary reasons: the tax system encourages philanthropy, not because it is lax but because it is wise. There is a recognition that individuals give more shrewdly than the state. In Britain, by contrast, the state believes that it alone should be bountiful-and the recent arrival of the national lottery, whose earnings are, in part, allotted to charities by state-appointed bodies, illustrates the point. Since the lottery began, personal giving in Britain has declined. In the past 20 years the proportion of households in Britain giving to charity has declined from 34% to 29%. 2000 will see Britain giving less, in real terms, than five years ago. 
In the United States giving will surge. The two most popular beneficiaries will be religious organisations (they will receive nearly $80 billion) and educational charities, notably universities ($28 billion). But the fastest-growing charities will be the wildlife organisations and those concerned with protecting the environment. America's huge personal wealth is a guarantee that this trend will continue. Many of the country's older millionaires will choose not to pass all their money on to their already rich and middle-aged children. And many of California's computer millionaires actually feel that it is morally wrong to do so. This is a trend that will gather pace in the years ahead-but not outside America.  1999 Eight short centuries ago, in the summer of 1212, many thousands of children, most of them boys around the age of 12, set out from France and the Rhineland to reconquer the Holy Land by the force of their love. The children fared miserably, but some adults did rather well: many of the relatively few young crusaders who got as far as Italy were captured by merchants and sold into slavery. The episode may be worth recalling as a new children's crusade, of a different sort, gathers force in America. 
In 1996, few people noticed when the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation and the American Cancer Society spent $30m to establish a new activist campaign. The National Center for Tobacco-Free Kids, as it was called, opened a fresh front in what it called the ""war on tobacco"". The new breed of activist noticed that most smokers first pick up a cigarette when they are minors (16 years old, on average). Never mind that 16 is not most people's idea of a ""child"", and that most teenagers who try cigarettes soon drop them: by concentrating on smoking and ""kids"", the activists thought, they could change the tenor of the public debate. 
So it was that anti-smoking campaigners characterised smoking as a ""pediatric disease"", and tobacco merchants as predators upon the young and helpless. The children's crusade against tobacco was not, by itself, decisive, but it went far to create the political climate that produced a settlement, in late 1998. Tobacco companies will now charge American smokers more for cigarettes while furnishing $246 billion-a fortune by any reckoning-to state governments, lawyers and anti-smoking campaigners. 
Humbug for all 
This success in 1998 was not lost on others in 1999. The supporters of stricter controls on guns in America-like the anti-smoking activists-had long been stymied by the political ferocity of their opponents and by the public's philosophical qualms about restricting law-- abiding adults' access to legal goods. In 1999, after several horrific episodes in which boys committed mass shootings in schools, activists began portraying guns as specifically a threat to children. Hillary Rodham Clinton, the president's wife, reflected the tone when she proclaimed: ""Guns and children are two words that should never be put together in the same sentence."" 
In fact, children (meaning adolescents, mainly) and guns have mixed comfortably in America for many years. A study for the American Justice Department has reported that young people who are given guns and taught to use them are less likely to commit crimes, including crimes involving firearms, than are young people who lack access to guns. The problem in America is not children and guns, but adults and guns. Turning the argument into one over ""kids"" did not, in reality, have as much to do with the welfare of children as with the ambitions of adults. 
In August 1999, the Environmental Protection Agency> America's main environmental regulator, announced its first restrictions intended speciFically, the agency said, to protect children. The link between the restricted pesticides and children was not altogether convincing: children eat more fruit and vegetables than adults (so the argument went), and their bodies are still developing, so pesticides would hurt them disproportionately. 
At about the same time, a report issued by congressional Republicans called for new measures restricting and otherwise discouraging violence in films, television shows, music and other media of mass communication. This, too, was pitched as a children's crusade. ""We must now devote ourselves"", said the report, ""to reducing the amount and degree of violence in our media and to shielding our children from such harmful depictions."" 
If 1999 saw the formula for children's crusades refined to a science, 2000 presents boundless opportunities to generalise its application. For example: 
Al Gore, Bill Clinton's vice-president and would be successor, hopes to move towards a broad national health insurance-succeeding where Mr Clinton failed-by promising health care for all children. 
As 2000 approached, Congress was considering seven bills-such as the ""Children's Protection Act,"" the ""Children's Defense Act,"" and the ""Protection of Children from On-Line Predators and Exploitation Act""-to regulate the Internet in the name of children. 
Firearms regulation, newly a ""kids""' issue. will heat to a boil as the lawsuits that dozens of states and cities have brought against gun manufacturers move: to trial. 
In the longer term, the repetition of ""Protect the children!"" as a rallying cry for activist adults spells its own undoing. Usually, however, gimmicks succeed for a while before ennui sets in. That should make 2000 a good year for campaigners of all stripes to see how many causes can be sent through the American legislatures and courts on the backs of innocent children. 
All change on Wall Street. The New York Stock Exchange, the world's largest, will become a forprofit business with its own stock listing. Shares will be quoted in decimals, not fractions.  1999 Robert Rubin, former secretary of the United States Treasury, gives warning that conventional wisdom is not a good guide to the future. 
There are two widely accepted ideas concerning economic matters in the years ahead. First, that there are powerful new forces at work-especially globalisation and the technology of the information age-that are creating immense change at a rapid pace and that this constitutes a new paradigm. And, second, that financial markets and market-based economics have replaced dirigiste economics and relegated government to a relatively minor role in economic affairs. 
Having spent 26 years on Wall Street and six-and-a-half years in government, living all of these changes first-hand, I believe that each of these statements is both powerfully right and powerfully wrong. 
Clearly, barriers to capital and trade flows have greatly decreased; the movement of capital, as well as goods and services, across borders has greatly increased; and technology is advancing rapidly and in profoundly important ways. The result seems almost surely to be significant productivity improvements, especially in America, though the official numbers do not yet appropriately show them and some of the claims being made may well be excessive. All of this holds great promise for the economies of all nations that are open to change and to trade, and that have sound policies in areas ranging from fiscal discipline to education. 
However, there are increasing numbers of commentators who extrapolate from all of this the idea of a new paradigm that is thought to lead to unprecedented conclusions with respect to business cycles, market valuations and the like. They are advocating a modern-day version of the famous thesis set forth in 1928 by Irving R. Fisher, a noted Yale economist, that we have reached a ""permanent plateau of prosperity"". 
I share the view that economic change is producing great benefits, and that the improved understanding of economics should lead us to better responses than the monetary and fiscal policies in the years following the 1929 crash. But everything I have experienced suggests that, at core, economic conditions and markets are grounded in the human psyche. That is, confidence or the lack thereof profoundly affects markets and economies, and confidence in turn has throughout the history of markets and economies tended to swing from excesses in one direction to excesses in the other. 
Perhaps the commentators are right and this is no longer operative, for the first time in human history. But the alternative is also possible. And our actions should reflect that alternative possibility. Public policymakers must continue to work intensely at the longterm project of reforming the architecture of the global financial markets. Private-sector managers must do what the private sector never does during good times: identify and weigh risks appropriately in decision-making. My impression is that the long period of good times in the industrial nations, and the rapid recovery when markets faltered, in 1987 and 1998, have dulled concern about risk. 
Another important piece of the great change taking place is the move towards market-based economics and away from dirigiste economics. This has led many commentators to say that financial markets, trading markets and the market-based economy have become so much more powerful than governments that public policy matters relatively little. 
There is no question, in my view, that government efforts to determine market prices in opposition to market forces cannot prevail over any period of time, and there is no question that global financial markets have become a powerful disciplinary force with respect to fiscal discipline, and monetary and other policies. 
On the other hand, that is only part of the story. Government still has a critically important role: different but no less important than the central planning and state ownership roles of yesteryear. 
We need governments 
Government must perform the functions that markets by their nature cannot or will not perform optimally, and these areas provide the underpinnings and framework for the market-based economy. Economists capture this idea with concepts like externality and market failure. Examples are public education, environmental protection, national defence and social safety nets. Of course, government can also mismanage, as by undue regulation, or by unsound fiscal or monetary policies, and that can be highly damaging. 
A critically important debate for the years ahead will be where this line between what markets do and what government does should be drawn. And this debate will be about not only what functions government should be involved with, but also, when government is involved, to what extent government should perform a given function itself and to what extent it should provide incentives or subsidies for the private sector to perform that function. School vouchers, private-sector prisons, trading markets in pollution rights, are good examples of battlegrounds in this debate in the United States. 
So, the more things change, the more things stay the same, in the sense that in the final analysis markets are about human beings and human nature. We should act to realise fully the potential for good in these powerful changes, but we must also eschew complacency and, in both the public and private sectors, realistically appraise risk and act accordingly. We must also allow market forces to operate where they can maximise our well-being, but support the government in performance of its critically important role. 
The future of the global economy is most promising, but to realise that promise the public and private sectors must act wisely on many fronts, sometimes in conflict with the conventional wisdom of the moment. the ambitions of adults. 
In August 1999, the Environmental Protection Agency, America's main environmental regulator, announced its first restrictions intended speciFically, the agency said, to protect children. The link between the restricted pesticides and children was not altogether convincing: children eat more fruit and vegetables than adults (so the argument went), and their bodies are still developing, so pesticides would hurt them disproportionately. 
At about the same time, a report issued by congressional Republicans called for new measures restricting and otherwise discouraging violence in films, television shows, music and other media of mass communication. This, too, was pitched as a children's crusade. ""We must now devote ourselves"", said the report, ""to reducing the amount and degree of violence in our media and to shielding our children from such harmful depictions."" 
If 1999 saw the formula for children's crusades refined to a science, 2000 presents boundless opportunities to generalise its application. For example: Al Gore, Bill Clinton's vice-president and would-be successor, hopes to move towards a broad national health insurance-succeeding where Mr Clinton failed-by promising health care for all children. 
As 2000 approached, Congress was considering seven bills-such as the ""Children's Protection Act,"" the ""Children's Defense Act,"" and the ""Protection of Children from On-Line Predators and Exploitation Act""-to regulate the Internet in the name of children. 
Firearms regulation, newly a ""kids""' issue will heat to a boil as the lawsuits that dozens of states and cities have brought against gun manufacturers move to trial. 
In the longer term, the repetition of ""Prefect the children!"" as a rallying cry for activist adults spells its own undoing. Usually, however, gimmicks succeed for a while before ennui sets in. That should make 2000 a good year for campaigners of all stripes to see how many causes can be sent through the American legislatures and courts on the backs of innocent children.  1999 In 1986 the price of oil plummeted from $30 to $10 a barrel, and Texas quaked in its oversized boots. Businesses went under, cities became virtual ghost towns, and oil men cut down their prime rib consumption at Houston's posh Petroleum Club. In 1998 oil prices once again tumbled through the floor, yet the Lone Star state barely noticed, having branched out from its monogamous relationship with oil towards one with software and semiconductors. It's not just Texas. Throughout America's south-west and mountain region states that were once at the mercy of commodity prices have undergone a high-tech revolution, creating thousands of new jobs and transforming themselves into America's new technological hubs. It is now the fastest-growing region in the country, and in 2000 it will flex its muscles, finally emerging as a political and economic powerhouse, which the two coasts can no longer ignore. 
While a booming economy lifted all American boats during the 1990s, the rising tide was perhaps most beneficial to the interior West region. The region led the nation in job creation and personal income growth during the decade, as cities such as Denver, Austin, Boise and Salt Lake City, once sleepy and regionally focused, emerged as global centres for telecommunications, software and biotechnology. By embracing new technologies, the region has stabilised its economic base, no longer the victim of boom-and-bust cycles in industries such as oil, copper and silver. It is now home to high-tech powerhouses such as Dell, Intel, USWest and Compaq. Technology companies will continue to move into the area in 2000, taking advantage of the region's low tax, pro-business climate. 
Another reason for the economic surge can be seen at the 37 border crossings between the United States and Mexico. The elimination of trade barriers after the passage of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) in 1993 has brought a rapid expansion of trade between the two countries, with all of the new commerce flowing through the American south-west. According to Philip Burgess, president of the Denverbased Centre for the New West, NAFTa has created a ""border economy"", growing 10% each year, from the Gulf of Mexico to the Pacific Ocean, with border areas in Texas, New Mexico, Arizona and Southern California joined in an economie alliance with northern Mexico. 
Fueled by new industry and a burgeoning job market, the region has experienced the fastest population growth during the 1990s, with almost 21% growth during the decade compared with the national rate of 9%. Of the 25 fastest-growing cities in America in 2000, 15 are located in the interior West. The Census Bureau predicts the booming growth will continue well into the 21st century. This growth is far from evenly spread, however, as the vast majority of the economic and demographic expansion has been in the cities. In Arizona, 80% of the state's (largely technology based) job growth is in the Phoenix area-evidence of what many experts see as a problematic ""digital divide"" in the region. 
The changing demographics are partly due to what Marc Perry of the Census Bureau calls the ""All the way there, half the way back"" phenomenon, That is to say, easterners who migrated to California and have become disillusioned with the state's urbanisationand for some, with California's growing Latino population-have sought new frontiers in the interior states. This demographic shift will benefit the region politically in the census, as six of the nine congressional seats expected to migrate as a result of the census will go to the interior West. More people means more money, as federal funds to the states are determined by census estimates. 
In addition to increasing its presence on Capitol Hill, the region will have a significant impact on the presidential election, having developed into the most solid Republican block in the nation. Despite predictions a decade ago that diversified economies in the west would attract more eastern liberals to the region, population growth has not altered the region's traditional conservatism, long fuelled by scepticism of federal government and regulation. The Republican Party now holds 14 of the region's 18 Senate seats, and all nine of the governors' mansions. 
In an attempt to boost the region's clout over the presidential nomination process, several western politicians pushed for an early ""Big Sky"" primary in 2000, in which the western states would all hold their primaries on the same day, as the southern states do on Super Tuesday. It failed, so most of the western states will now hold their primaries too late in 2000 to have an impact on who earns the two parties' nominations. On election day, however, the impact will be unmistakable. The betting is that all nine states will vote for the Republican nominee in November 2000. 
Mark Mazzetti: south-west United States correspondent, The Economist.  1999 Americans will look on with seeming carelessness as their political system appears to be hijacked in 2000 by the power of money. They will know perfectly well that their democracy is being distorted by vast payments of cash from ""special interests"". They will accept with insouciance the most cynical view of politicians selling their souls and votes to the highest bidder. But they will convey little sense of urgency to their elected representatives of the need to fix the role of money in elections. And they will place campaign-finance reform near the bottom of their ranking of domestic public policy priorities. 
The political elites are likewise in no hurry to mend things. Saturation press coverage of fund-raising scandals during the 1996 presidential election and a deluge of emotional newspaper editorials since then have been insufficient to embarrass Congress into patching the most gaping loopholes in current law. 
Political financing has already become a major focus of newspaper reporting during this election cycle. The phenomenal early fundraising success of George W. Bush, the Texas governor, drew the spotlights. (He raised $37m in the first half of 1999, almost three times the previous record.] His subsequent decision to forgo public matching funds (making him only the third candidate to reject the public money that has been available since 1974) was the signal political event of the pre-primary presidential campaign. A close second was how easily Bill Bradley, a former senator, raised $12m in contributions. This has immediately made him a credible challenger to Vice-President Al Gore for the Democratic nomination. 
Both parties have announced that they hope to raise over $200m for their non-federal or ""soft money"" accounts. These funds have the virtue of being able to receive donations from corporations or trade unions that would otherwise be prohibited; and there are none of the limits on the size of contributions from individuals that apply to federal or hard money accounts. During the 1996 and 1998 elections, the parties discovered ever-more creative ways of spending soft money, thus craftily avoiding the restrictions embedded in federal campaign finance law. 
Campaign-finance reform will get more attention because two presidential aspirants, John McCain, a Republican senator, and Mr Bradley, have made it centrepieces of their campaigns. Mr McCain's decision to scale back his reform bill, by abandoning efforts to regulate election-oriented ""issue"" advertisements but retaining the ban on soft money, was not sufficient in the autumn of 1999 to garner the 60 votes needed to end the Republican filibuster and pave the way for some changes in the law. But it will provide a platform for Mr McCain and his allies to try to shake the public from its lethargy. Even in the unlikely event that those efforts were successful and the current Congress enacts campaign-finance reform, it would be too late to have any effect on the 2000 campaign. 
The prominent role of political money hardly makes America unique among the world's democracies. The experience of other countries in grappling with these problems suggests that the rules of political finance are important but secondary in shaping democratic accountability. Indeed efforts to deal with it have often yielded disappointing results. Scandals have arisen in many countries before and after reforms were adopted. Levels of corruption are not strongly related to the extent of public subsidies or the intensity of regulation of party and campaign finance. 
Idealism or reality? 
This is not a counsel of despair. It is a brief for realism. There is a tension between the reality of economic inequality and the ideal of political equality. Political parties and candidates for office need money to compete successfully in elections. Relatively few citizens have the personal means or desire to contribute to political campaigns. Under these circumstances, efforts to prevent concentrations of wealth from undermining political equality may conflict with freedoms of speech and association. The challenge in future will not be to eliminate the tension altogether but to manage it better. 
In the case of America, that means first of all restoring credibility to campaign-finance laws, some enacted as long ago as 1907, that have in recent years been shredded beyond recognition. First eliminate soft money and restore the long-standing prohibition against political financing from corporate and union treasuries. More controls on election-oriented ""issue"" advertisements would sharpen the transparency of campaigns. Adequately funding the account for public financing of presidential elections would avoid a repeat of the embarrassment of 2000 when the Treasury will be unable to meet its legal obligations to match the private contributions of presidential candidates. 
Beyond these immediate but critical fixes, reformers will continue to wrestle with slowing the money chase. They will want to foster the participation of small donors and grass-roots organisations. They will call for an appropriate role for political parties in campaign finance that does not relegate them to mere instruments for money-laundering. But these reforms will fail to balance the interests at stake. In short there seems to be no alternative to muddling through-which is exactly what will happen. 
Thomas E. Mann: W. Averell Harriman Senior Fellow in American Governance, the Brookings Institution.  1999 Hollywood will turn its gaze upward to the heavens and forward to the future. Two of the biggest blockbusters of 2000, both due out in March, will examine bids to colonise the most fashionable of planets, Mars: Walt Disney's ""Mission to Mars"" and Warner Brother's ""Red Planet"". In ""Space Cowboys"", another Warner Brothers film, ""a bunch of old guys"" led by Clint Eastwood venture into outer space, while in ""Titan AE"" (Fox), a teenager goes in search of a spacecraft that can save the world. Steven Spielberg reheats an old Philip K. Dick science-fiction story, ""Minority Report"", about a judicial system in which potential murderers are arrested before they can do any harm and, in its third sci-fi blockbuster of the year, ""Battleship Earth"", Warner Brothers succeeds in finding a new backdrop for John Travolta. 
Hollywood's other great inspiration at the millennium will be the past. Two of the best historical blockbusters for years will be Sony's ""Patriot"", a CivilWar epic starring Mel Gibson, and DreamWorks' ""Gladiator"", directed by Ridley Scott. Miramax is capitalising on its successful ""Shakespeare in Love"" with souped-up versions of Hamlet, Othello and Love's Labour's Lost. (The studio has wisely avoided overstraining the public's appetite for doublet and hose: Kenneth Branagh has turned ""Love's Labour's Lost"" into a 1950s musical.) 
The history that Hollywood is happiest with, however, is its own. Disney opens the year with 
""Fantasia 2000"", with seven new pieces set to music, including one by Shostakovich, and closes it with ""102 Dalmatians"". There will be sequels to ""Mission Impossible"" (which, if we are lucky, may explain what was going on in the first film), ""Beavis and Butthead"", along with ""Scream 3"" and a prequel to the Flintstones series. Those quintessential 70s figures, Shaft and Charlie's Angels, will return. Hollywood is also making yet another attempt to revive the musical, not only with ""Love's Labour's Lost"" but also with ""Moulin Rouge"", starring Ewan McGregor and Nicole Kidman. 
There will be the usual rash of adaptations of best-selling novels. Mr Spielberg will lay a practised hand on ""Memoirs of a Geisha"", George Clooney will wrestle with the ocean in ""A Perfect Storm"" and Leonardo Di Caprio will discover that a Thai paradise is not all it is cracked up to be in ""The Beach."" 
The most unexpected development of the year will be Hollywood's loveaffair with hairdressers. In January, Warner Brothers will release ""The Big Tease"" (motto: ""he came, he coiffed, he conquered""), about a gay Glaswegian hairdresser who takes on the Los Angeles hair establishment. (The studio is showing the film to hairdressers before its official release, on the grounds that nobody is better placed to generate word-of-mouth publicity.) Later in the year Miramax will release ""Blow Dry"", the story of the rivalry between two hairdressing salons in a small town, written by the author of ""The Full Monty"". 
Adrian Wooldridge: West Coast correspondent, The Economist.  1999 Canada is arguably the world's most successful country: year after year it tops the United Nations' Development Index. But year after year-and 2000 will be no exception-it becomes a little more like the United States. (It is, after all, slightly less wealthy than California.) Indeed Canada's politicians will spend the coming months promoting themselves with an enthusiasm seldom seen north of the border. They may not outdo their electioneering colleagues further south, but open displays of political ambition are hardly what Canadians have come to expect from their leaders. 
The prime minister, Jean Chretien, tired of being underestimated by friend and foe alike, will strive for a place in the history books alongside more flamboyant predecessors such as Pierre Trudeau and Brian Mulroney. The opposition leader, Preston Manning, will risk his leadership of the Reform Party with continued attempts to forge a nation-wide coalition with the Progressive Conservatives (the ""United Alternative"") against Mr Chretien's Liberals. Lucien Bouchard, premier of Quebec, will be tempted yet again to put to a referendum the question of the secession of his francophone province from the anglophone rest of Canada. 
Mr Bouchard has talked of calling a referendum only if there are ""winning conditions"", but until the wording of the cuestion is defined, these ""conditions"" will also remain conveniently undefined. Most francophone Quebeckers suspect they will never get the respect they deserve from their anglophone compatriots, but does that mean they will vote to leave Canada? Most polls suggest that they want to have their gateau and eat it: they flirt with secession but worry about its consequences, and so prefer, in the end, to avoid it. 
Throughout the coming year politicians will be indulging their ambitions just as Canada's economic outlook, so robust at the end of the 1990s, takes on a less favourable aspect. As growth slows in America, so it will in Canada too. The question is how painful the slowing will be. Roughly a third of GDP consists of exports south of the border. In other words, if and when the American economy sneezes, the Canadian economy will catch a cold-especially in Ontario, whose exports to America account for two-fifths of its GDP. 
All of which means that in politics, 2000 will be a frustrating year, especially for those talented Liberals, the finance minister, Paul Martin, for example, and the Newfoundland premier, Brian Tobin, who reckon they, not Mr Chretien> would make better prime ministers. Partly to quieten the rivalry, Mr Chretien has promised to lead his party into the next election, and this need not be until June 2002. Although many analysts reckon that Mr Chretien will use the millennium as a graceful way to bow out early, why should he? After all, he rather enjoys living at 24 Sussex Drive, the Ottawa residence that comes with the job. With the economy slowing, the politicians posturing more than normal and the Quebec issue once again in the headlines, some Canadians will feel their 21st century is getting off to an inauspicious start, not least because unemployment, around 8% for most of 1999, will start to edge up again. 
Yet behind the headlines the reality will be more promising. The competitive spur of NAFTA and the reforming instincts and fiscal rigour of Mr Martin (no respecter of the Liberals' wishy washy tradition) mean that the country's balance sheet will still look remarkably healthy. Canada will be the only G7 country other than America to be in a financial surplus-and that surplus will apply not just at the federal level but also in most of the provinces. Moreover, the effects of America's slowdown will be mitigated (especially for British Columbia) by a recovery in Canada's Asian markets and, at some point, a rise in oil and commodity prices. 
The difficulty will be to persuade Canadians to keep up the good work. The slimming of the public sector will lead to more outbreaks of industrial unrest, such as the 1999 nurses' strike in Saskatchewan, and more worries for the future of Canada's universal health-care system and its publicly financed schools and universities. Yet at the same time Canada's businessmen, conscious that they cannot hide forever behind a weak currency, will clamour for lower taxes. 
And rightly so if Canada is to staunch the ""brain drain"" that flows south each year in the form of thousands of well-educated professionals. Ironically, the greater the flow, the more determined most Canadians-from the prime minister on-will be to distinguish themselves from Americans. (One flow that may stop in 2000 is the flow of Canada's water to some states in America. This is certain to cause a row or two.) 
In some ways this will be an exercise in futility: Canadians watch the soap operas of America's television rather than the worthy offerings of the publicly owned Canadian Broadcasting Corporation; and they regard recognition in America, not Canada, as the mark of business, sporting or artistic success. 
Yet at the same time, with a defiant glance southwards and regardless of their interprovincial squabbles, they can justly celebrate Canada's many strengths. These include a disproportionately large contribution to international peacekeeping; a sense of social compassion; and a belief that as a nation of immigrants Canada is better served by a policy of tolerant ""multiculturalism"" than the ""melting pot"" notion to which America pretends. 
As more and more of their companies are bought by American investors, Canadians will try to make sure that what is Canadian by nature remains that way. If Ottawa's politicians can be confident about Canada and not defensive, then the country will remain truly distinctive from its neighbour for many years to come. 
Wild salmon will make their last Atlantic run. In 1975 there were 800,000 of these noble fish: 25 years later there will be an unsustainable 20,000. 
John Andrews: correspondent for The Economist, now based in Paris.  1999 Beset by growing social instability, a faltering economy and heightened tensions with Taiwan and America, China will hardly be in a mood to celebrate what it had hoped would be a year for trumpeting the successes of its ""socialist modernisation"". 
Although 1999 was symbolically important in marking the 50th anniversary of communist rule in China, its leaders have long attached even greater importance to 2000 as a target date for achieving key development goals such as the elimination of poverty and the eradication of illiteracy among the young and middle-aged. But it now seems likely that the significant progress that China has made towards achieving these goals will be overshadowed by a host of other problems, some of them threatening the party's survival. China's successful rush to capitalism will demand ever greater freedom that the Communist leadership will be reluctant to give. 
China's leaders will be glad that their bid to host the 2000 Olympic Games in Beijing was narrowly defeated by Sydney. They can look forward now to a year unencumbered by major international events or sensitive anniversaries. They will be relieved to see the back of 1999a year in which they pulled out every stop to ensure social stability during a string of potentially troublesome dates, including the 10th anniversary in June of the crushing of the Tiananmen Square protests and the anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic. But the leadership cannot afford to relax. 
The end of 1999 will focus more attendon on a problem that has bedevilled the Communist Party for the past 50 years: the status of Taiwan. Following the return of the Portuguese-administered territory of Macao to Chinese rule on December 20th 1999, the entire Chinese mainland, for the first time since the Ming Dynasty, will be under the control of a single, indigenous government. In Beijing's view, Taiwan will thus become the last remaining holdout in China of an administration that professes no allegiance to the Communist Party. 2000 will be a year of crisis in relations between Beijing and Taipei. 
Storm clouds began to gather over the Taiwan Straits in July 1999 when President Lee Teng-hui of Taiwan declared that his island's relations with the mainland should be treated on a ""stateto-state"" basis, thereby brushing aside the longstanding etiquette whereby both sides would say there was but one China. President Lee will stand down in March 2000 at the end of his maximum two terms in office. Beijing will anxiously await the outcome of the resulting presidential election. 
China's handling of the Taiwan issue will have a considerable impact on the volatile relationship between Beijing and Washington. America's presidential election in November 2000 will aggravate tensions, as candidates vie to demonstrate their readiness to deal firmly with Chinese transgressions. President Bill Clinton himself has warned of the danger of a ""campaign-driven cold war with China"". 
Beijing too is heading for a period of heightened political uncertainty as the Communist Party prepares for leadership changes at its 16th Congress in 2002 and at the following year's annual session of the parliament, the National People's Congress, when Jiang Zemin will be constitutionally obliged to step down as head of state. The man to watch in 2000 will be Vice-President Hu Jintao, a colourless technocrat being groomed by Mr Jiang for the presidency. The question is whether Mr Hu will also take over Mr Jung's more crucial post as Communist Party chief, or whether the country is heading for another Deng Xiaoping-style gerontocracy with Mr Jiang-already 73-clinging on into his dotage. 
Anyone aspiring to take over from Mr Jiang as party general secretary would be a brave person indeed. The party is becoming an unruly body. The ""Three Stresses"" campaign to restore ideological, political and moral rectitude among party members will not stop the rot. The root cause of widespread corruption and ill-discipline within the party is that many of its members have little sense of where the leadership is taking them or what their future will be in a country undergoing rapid change. The coming year will inevitably see numerous new cases of top level wrongdoing coming to light. 
It would certainly take a leader of extraordinary vision to steer the country through its economic difficulties. In 1998 Zhu Rongji, the prime minister, called for the fortunes of loss-making state-owned enterprises to be turned around by 2000. Though dubbed China's ""economics tsar"" by his western admirers, Mr Zhu has made little obvious headway. In an effort to revive the economy, Mr Zhu might well try devaluing the currency, the yuan, sometime in 2000. But it is far from clear that this would revive consumer confidence and halt the crippling deflationary spiral that has beset the country since late 1997. 
But it may not be all gloom for China's leaders in 2000. One event that could boost morale is the launch of the country's first manned space vehicle. This would make it only the third country after Russia and the United States to put a person into space. The intended message to the outside world would be that for all its problems, China is a major power with the expertise to match the West in the century to come. 
James Miles: senior Chinese affairs analyst, BBC news.  1999 First the good news. The turmoil that has surrounded the Japanese government ever since disgruntled voters threw the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) out of office in 1993, after 38 years of unbroken rule, is finally coming to an end. The Japanese people still do not believe that the Liberal Democrats have abandoned their venal ways. But they prefer the probusiness conservatives-especially when it comes to sorting out the country's financial and economic woes-to the squabbling ideologues of the opposition. Above all, they prefer to see the LDP in power but kept firmly on a leash, forced to govern through a coalition. 
In the general election that must be held before October 2000, the Japanese people will renew the Lnr-led coalition's mandate for another four years. They may even grant the Liberal Democrats an increased majority in the 500-seat lower house of the Diet (parliament). But there is absolutely nothing that the ruling party can do about its shortage of seats in the upper house for at least two more years-and quite possibly for a further five years given the chamber's distorted demographics. For the foreseeable future, therefore, Japan will be run by a coalition of conservative forces-the LDP plus the hawkish Liberal Party and the Buddhist-backed New Komeito. 
Now for the even better news: 2000 will see Japan, if not quite its old self, at least economically back on its feet again. After suffering its worst recession in living memory-prolonged by the miscalculations of political leaders and compounded by bungling, foot-dragging and denial on the part of the country's once-lauded bureaucracy-Japan should experience real growth of 2% during 2000, with possibly as much as 3% in 2001. This turnaround in Japan's political and economic fortunes owes much to the most improbable of figures. When handed the job by party bigwigs in mid1998, Keizo Obuchi was expected to be no more than a stop-gap prime minister. Pundits gave the uncharismatic leader of the LDP's largest faction months in office at most, as he served out the tail-end of the premiership vacated by the over-ambitious Ryutaro Hashimoto. The Obuchi government currently enjoys one of the highest popularity ratings in ages. And for good reason. The economic turnaround is largely a consequence of actions taken early in the Obuchi government's first term to clean up the country's banking mess and pump liquidity into the parched economy. 
The first glimmer of recovery came between January and March 1999 when the economy surprised everyone by growing by 2%. One by one, embarrassed economists began to revise their gloomy forecasts upwards. Most still believe that Mr Obuchi is a bit optimistic in promising the people that the economy will grow by an annual 0.5% in the fiscal year that ends in March 2000. But the consensus now is that the prime minister will at least be able to claim to have arrested the decline and got the economy growing again. Rather than risk jeopardising the fragile recovery-and alienate voters who will be heading shortly for the voting booths-the Lnr voted last September to give Mr Obuchi a second term. 
A recovery there may be, but that does not mean an end to the pain. Having finally shattered the myth of lifetime employment, Japanese companies will push joblessness-higher nowadays in Japan than in America-to over 6% during 2000 as they slash payrolls and reengineer their businesses every bit as vigorously as American firms did a decade ago. 
Two entirely new factors will keep Japanese managers' feet to the fire in 2000. One is a coming change in bookkeeping. From April, Japanese firms will have to prepare their consolidated accounts according to international standards, forcing them to close loopholes which allowed them to hide losses from their investors and profits from the taxman. Proper consolidated accounting will also reveal the full horror of their pension nightmares. Even among Japan's most respected companies, unfunded pension liabilities are going to be taking large bites out of profits for many years to come. 
The second factor that will make corporate Japan mend its ways in 2000 is the wholly new attitude that has been forced on the banks by their own troubles. Gone are the days when the Ministry of Finance could protect Japanese banks from the worst of their follies by ensuring that even the most incompetent remained profitable. Instead of doling out loans blindly to all and sundry, Japanese banks will henceforth have to weigh up the risks involved in each loan, using alien yardsticks such as a company's return on assets, its corporate strategy, its product development and its market record as guides to its credit worthiness. And bank loans will be priced at internationally competitive rates. Starting in 2000, the cost of capital for Japanese business will go through the roof. The wave of business mergers that will follow could easily send unemployment soaring towards 10%. Fortunately, from 2000 onwards, the hardship will be mitigated by an economy that has begun to grow. 
Nicholas Valery: Tokyo bureau chief, The Economist.  1999 The race to succeed Lee Teng-hui as Taiwan's president will be lively. Taiwan has truly taken to democracy, to the embarrassment of many of its neighbours. The wooden but competent vice-president, Lien Chan, is the official candidate of the ruling Kuomintang in the March 2000 election. The charismatic former mayor of Taipei, Chen Shui-bian, is carrying the flag for the main opposition Democratic Progressive Party. Adding spice is the participation of a former provincial governor, James Soong, who, after falling out with Mr Lee, is standing as an independent. 
Mr Soong is the front-runner but faces a tough race, partly because of his mainlander background. China was angered by the Taiwan government's redefinition in July of cross-Strait links as ""state-to-state"". Any further rise in tensions between the two sides-- caused, say, by Chinese attempts to intimidate Taiwan militarily-would damage Mr Soong, Mr Lien, perceived as a safe pair of hands, would benefit from a rise in tensions with China, as would Mr Chen. Mr Lien will also benefit from the vast finances of the Kuomintang. 
Attempts by China to intimidate Taiwan would drag down economic growth and cause tremors on the stockmarket. In the absence of such distractions Taiwan's GnP, estimated to have grown by 5.5% in 1999, will surge forward again in 2000, fuelled by the exports and investment spending of the island's high-tech manufacturers. 
Look out for the start of Taiwan's state lottery. It will raise $3 billion a year, mostly for new pensions and health. One area of concern is the general government deficit, which was 3.3% of GDP. As a result of the devastating earthquake on September 21st the deficit is likely to rise in 2000. The deterioration will, however, be limited by the government's privatisation programme, when onethird of the largest state-owned enterprise, Chunghwa Telecom, is sold, raising $6 billion.  1999 To judge from the commotion going on, visitors to Okinawa could be forgiven for thinking that the Olympic Games were being staged there this summer. All the construction, preparation and disruption on Japan's most southerly island prefecture is actually for the three-day summit meeting between the leaders of the Group of Seven industrial countries plus Russia on July 21st-24th. To keep everyone cheerfully loquacious, local distillers of awamori-a rice-based spirit that has been produced in Okinawa for more than 500 years-have formulated a special brew to be served at official receptions. 
Public handouts have been a way of life for Okinawans since the end of the second world war. The chain of subtropical islands, 1,600km south-west of Tokyo> was governed by the American military until it was handed back in 1972. It has remained Japan's poorest and most heavily subsidised prefecture ever since. 
The one big stick locals have for beating the authorities in Tokyo is the fact that, despite accounting for no more than 1% of the Japanese land mass, Okinawa provides 75% of the facilities used by American forces in Japan and accommodates 29,000 of the 47,000 soldiers stationed in the archipelago. So whenever Okinawans feel they need something from the central government, they bring out the ""Yankee Go Home"" signs. It never fails. 
The chance to host the summit was part of a government bribe to get the local community to accept a new site for the huge Futenma helicopter station used by the American marines. No surprise then that it is to Nago-an hour or two's drive to the north-east of the prefectural capital of Naha and its airport-that the leaders of the industrial world will congregate for three days.  1999 One of the remarkable features of Japan in the 1970s and 1980s was that it seemed impervious to goings-on in the outside world. High dollar or low dollar, detente or evil empire, booming Asia or stumbling Asia, Japan just kept rolling on. The 1973 oil shock did knock it over for a year, but it clambered upright more quickly than any other developed economy. It did have to make appropriate foreign-policy noises at appropriate moments to please the Americans, but without any great effort. In 2000, however, it will be acutely vulnerable to events in the outside world. Its fate in the coming few years will depend, more than anything else, on what happens in three other countries: the United States, China and North Korea. 
The reason for this is more than just the banal reality of international interdependence. As the world's secondlargest economy and as Asia's most developed and richest country, you would expect Japan to have more control over its own fate than this. When, in the late 1980s, it looked destined soon to overtake America, it was widely assumed that political power-which, really, means the ability to influence events-would soon follow. It hasn't, because Japan's economy has stagnated for a decade. That stagnation has exposed the inability of any political party to take effective charge of domestic policy. Which, in turn, has left foreign policy dangling in the wind. 
The very thing that seemed to explain Japan's success-that politicians stayed out of the way of bureaucrats and businessmen-has in the 1990s prolonged its weakness. Businessmen became burdened with debts, and throttled by a collapsed financial system. Bureaucrats were discredited by corruption, and by their own initial attempts to lie about the financial crisis in the hope that it might soon mend itself. For once, politicians were needed, to make the hard choices that financial and economic restructuring required, and to restore control over the bureaucracy. By and large, however, they failed to rise to the occasion. 
That was why Japan was hit so hard by the East Asian financial crisis of 1997-98. At the time its economy was just struggling back to its feet, but without having had any proper financial restructuring. So this new blow, which would have bounced off the Japan of the 1970s or 1980s, toppled it back over. Its exports were hit, its banks' bad-debt burden increased, the nervousness of its consumers merely heightened. In 1999, its economy has again been struggling to its feet. But, again, there has not yet been any fundamental reform. So a new financial crisis, especially one sweeping across the Pacific from the United States, would knock it down again. 
Meanwhile, short of any clear political leadership, this rich but vulnerable country is living in an increasingly tense neighbourhood. China, Japan's traditional rival for regional leadership, is going to pass through some sort of economic and thus political crisis as the strains in its fairlyfree-market economy put pressure on its very-unfree communist dictatorship. That will mainly be a domestic affair. But it is bound to have repercussions for Taiwan, which is the cause celebre of Chinese nationalists, especially those in its armed forces. If so, that will affect us all but especially Japan, which has been Taiwan's strongest supporter in the region. 
A new nationalism 
Japanese politicians, particularly in the ruling Liberal Democratic Party, are quite hawkish about Taiwan. It is the one topic on which Japan's foreign policy could reasonably be called brave in recent years. Will they remain brave if, in the next few years, China steps up its rhetorical attacks on Taiwan, imposes a blockade or even invades? One cannot know in advance, but it looks quite likely. Domestic economic weakness may even make a hawkish response more probable. Japanese politicians have their idiosyncracies, but in one way, they are similar to their counterparts elsewhere: in the face of trouble at home, they are likely to be tempted by a unifying cause abroad. 
North Korea is the other possible such cause. Already, in 1999, the threat of North Korean missiles suddenly made it possible to break a long impasse over co-operation with the United States in developing and deploying (around 200710) a theatre missile defence shield. The North Koreans are past masters at using brinkmanship as a negotiating ploy. Japan's problem is that the Koreans, to make this ploy work, need to keep coming up with new threats. It is Japan that is the obvious target for such threats, be they from terrorism, or missile tests, or something new. 
The upshot of all this is an apparent paradox. Once-proud, independent Japan enters the 21st century in a vulnerable state, its fate worryingly in the hands of outside forces. The paradox is that this, at last, could well stir the politicians into life, offering them a unifying cause. 
That cause will be nationalism, and much of the Japanese public will be susceptible to it. Is that a scary prospect for the outside world? Nationalism is the sort of brew that can always boil over into something unpleasant. But in today's and tomorrow's Japan, that is unlikely. It is much likelier to be positive: finally waking Japan up to play its proper role as a regional power. 
Bill Emmott: editor, The Economist.  1999 Remember the books that predicted the dawning of an Asian century that would eclipse the western world? Pull them down again. One day it will happen. In another 25 years Asia will dominate more than half the world's economy. By then the financial crisis that began in 1997 will be seen as no more than a downward blip in a long period of sustained growth. Instead of the decade of gloom that many feared lay ahead, East Asia will be bouncing back in 2000. Some of the tigers will again roar. But the sound they will make will be different, and in many ways more frightening to westerners. 
The shocks to the financial and business environment over the past three years have been so enormous that the region's economies will not resume all of their old exuberant ways. Consumer spending will be the thing to watch. It accounts for more than half the region's economic activity. Increases in consumer spending will show that the recovery is sustainable. But the details will be important. Although some people will be splashing out on new Mercedes-Benzs and Gucci handbags, much of the growth in spending will come from more modest purchases that reflect an end to the belttightening. People will want to do up their homes, replace worn out domestic appliances and perhaps take an overseas holiday. These are mostly things put off for the past two years. 
So growth will be tempered and might top out in 2000. One of the most important factors is that many East Asians remain worried. Two generations have grown up only ever knowing their incomes grow. Now they have experienced declining standards of living, or even unemployment. This has come as a shock and, as Asia recovers, many will be cautious. They will not borrow so much money-especially in foreign currencies-or invest so haphazardly. Caution, the result of hard lessons, is not necessarily a bad thing in the short term. 
Of course some people will desperately cling to the worst features of Asian business: a lack of transparency with too much cronyism and corruption. This is why there are good reasons for caution. Many problems have been hidden. This is particularly so with bust banks and debt-laden companies that have not restructured or closed down. The cracks have simply been papered over in the hope that, as the good times return, the difficulties will not seem so large and may even fade away all together. Some banks and firms will be unable to keep up the pretence. Companies that have put their houses in order will provide increased competition and attract the most interest from local and foreign investors. This will put more pressure on problem firms, and some will fail in 2000. 
The tremors from the banking world will be particularly strong. Many banks are still sitting on frightening amounts of bad loans which, even in improving economic conditions, are never likely to be repaid. One reason for this is that the speed of the recovery has meant that tougher bankruptcy provisions planned by some governments have not been fully implemented. If companies cannot be easily wound up, their debts pile up and their assets cannot be put to use by others. Scandals, wrangling over who is to blame for past problems and political interference will also continue to take its toll on the Asian recovery. 
Meanwhile the chant of reformasi, the rallying cry of the Indonesian students that brought down President Suharto in May 1998, will echo around the region. Indonesia, the giant in SouthEast Asia with a population of 200m, will continue on the path to democracy under its new president, Abdurrahman Wahid. As East Timor struggles to become an independent nation, it will stir fears about a break-up of the sprawling archipelago. Politicians from some of Indonesia's neighbours, in particular the generals who run Myanmar, will try to present the problems facing Indonesia as evidence that only strong governments work in the region. This view will sit even more uneasily with a group of increasingly democratic and open governments led by South Korea, Taiwan, the Philippines and Thailand. 
None of these headwinds will be lost on Singapore, which proved to be one of the most resilient economies throughout the crisis. Although it is virtually a oneparty state, Singapore's leaders have well-tuned antennae. They will liberalise the island's economy even further and try to attract higher-value industries. At the same time, Singapore's leaders will allow the boundaries of personal freedom to be pushed wider than ever before. The reasons go beyond simply allowing Singaporeans to do more before they demand more: the government wants to encourage more entrepreneurial activity, but cannot orchestrate that without dismantling the nanny state. The lesson that Singapore can teach the rest of the region (and also China) is that capitalism has to be an honest system to work. A lack of corruption, transparent accounts, Anglo-American corporate governance-these are the things that will create wealth in Asia. 
Even where democracy has a firm hold people will demand a greater say in running their country. In South Korea, one of the leaders in reform, there will be pressure on the president, Kim Dae Jung, to deliver more accountable government. Mr Kim will have his hands busy battling to reform the chaebol, the conglomerates that have increased their grip on the nation's economy during the financial crisis. 
The one thing that was always true about East Asia will be more true than ever: it is a region of very different economies and policies. This will become more apparent in 2000. Those who have reformed the most will do best. 
Paul Markillie: Asia editor, The Economist.  1999 India enters its 50th anniversary as a republic in high spirits. Its people take pride in having humbled Pakistan in Kashmir, in the stunning success of Indian businessmen overseas, in recent breakthroughs in literacy and population growth, in respectable though not tigerish economic growth and in the slow sloughing off of socialist regulation. Yet they will rightly moan about worsening governance, growing corruption and crime, and shortages of basics like water and electricity. 
The jingoism generated by the confrontation in Kashmir, which flared after Pakistani-backed separatists crossed the ""line of control"" into Indian territory and occupied heights near the towns of Kargil, will resonate in 2000, and keep the subcontinent an area of tension. Expect defence spending to rise officially from 2.5% of crrr in 1999 to 3.0% in 2000 (3.5% if you include some secret purchases). Kargil exhausted much of India's stock of artillery shells, and showed how difficult it was to throw back even a modest number of infiltrators. So India's venal politicians will strike big new arms deals, combining patriotic fervour with lucrative kickbacks. 
Expect the Indian film industry, the biggest in the world, to churn out several movies depicting heroic Indian soldiers thrashing slimy Pakistanis. Expect Pakistan to produce its own movies depicting courageous Kashmiri freedom fighters being gunned down by slimy Indians. Expect the two countries to jam one another's satellite broadcasts of these propaganda efforts. 
According to some official estimates, the billionth Indian was born in 1999. But most demographers believe the event will take place only in 2000, thanks to India's success in slowing population growth over the past generation. Contraception has reduced the birth rate from 48 per 1,000 50 years ago to 27 per 1,000 now, but improved health care has simultaneously reduced the death rate just as rapidly, so for decades the population kept growing at 2.0% per year. However, the death rate is levelling off while the birth rate continues to fall. So population growth is now down to 1.6% annually, and could fall to 1.0% by 2010. 
Expect continuing improvement in literacy too. In 1991, adult literacy was only 52%, well below the level in many African countries. But new political awareness of the importance of primary education has helped the literacy rate to shoot up to nearer 64%. Both the urbanrural gap and male-female literacy gap have shrunk faster than the national average. Education will become a hot political topic in coming years, now that the information revolution is reaching villages through the extension of telecoms and the Internet. 
With the 50th anniversary of India's birth as a republic on January 26th, there will be many long speeches on the country's success in staying democratic in the face of huge strains. Yet critics will say this deserves maybe two cheers but not three. Fifty years ago politicians were viewed as heroes who had won India independence. Today they are viewed as corrupt and criminal. Expect researchers to celebrate the anniversary with fresh data on the number of criminals in the country's many legislatures. (The last estimate, made two years ago by a member of the Election Commission, put the number of criminals at 40 in Parliament and 700 in the state legislatures.) The judicial system is so slow and the police system so incompetent that not a single politician has been convicted of corruption through all stages of appeal. A former prime minister, Narasimha Rao, is still defending a case of alleged cheating in 1984: the complainant has already died of old age. 
When India became a republic, politicians declared that Indians could at last succeed in ways that were impossible under white rule. But today Indians are achieving stunning success not at home, but abroad. Ron Dutta has become head of the world's biggest airline, United Airlines, and Rakesh Gangwal is boss of us Air. Sabeer Bhatia invented Hotmail, the most popular form of Internet based email, and sold it for $400m to Microsoft. Silicon Valley overflows with Indian entrepreneur millionaires. None of these gentlemen would have fared anywhere near as well in India, where talent does not take you far. Fifty years after becoming a republic, Indians are faring better in countries ruled by whites than in their own. Expect politicians to do absolutely nothing about it. 
Swaminathan S. Anklesaria Aiyar: consulting editor of the Economic Times, India.  1999 It will be another tense year. The ruling military junta has promised to hold an election once a new constitution is finished, but progress will remain painfully slow. In the meantime, the junta will continue its efforts to smash the main opposition party, the National League for Democracy (NLD). Tensions will be particularly high in late May, the tenth anniversary of the NLD's 1990 election victory-a result that the military rulers never implemented. Opposition, which comes not just from the NLD but from student, religious and ethnic groups as well, could turn violent. 
But the junta should retain control. It has a vast military and intelligence network, backed by its political wing, the Union Solidarity Development Association. It is unclear how much real support the junta enjoys even within these groups. However, its oppressive tactics have resulted in what the leader of the NLn, Aung San Suu Kyi, has termed a ""blanket of fear"" settling over the country. 
Desperate to break the deadlock, foreign governments will repeat their calls for dialogue between the junta and the opposition. American sanctions will be up for renewal once again in May 2000, and there is also the possibility that the multilateral institutions will again offer to release aid in exchange for steps towards political reform. If the junta grasps the nettle, Myanmar's economic prospects will improve considerably. 
But a change of heart is unlikely. In the absence of reform, efforts to boost agricultural output will be hampered by a shortage of fuel, pesticides and fertiliser, while a dearth of foreign investment will hurt industrial output. The free-market exchange rate will depreciate further. 
Myanmar is a country that, like Cuba and North Korea, has turned its back on the world. As a result it will be 2000's most needlessly miserable country.  1999 When the Queen of England visits Australia in March, she will find that the ex-- colony's recent vote to keep her on as head of state, and not to declare a republic, has left the nation republican in spirit but monarchist in form. The failed vote for a republic was the result of political division (extraordinarily, Prime Minister John Howard advocated a ""no"" vote) and a high level of public disdain for politicians, rather than enthusiasm for the British monarchy. It leaves Australia with a 19th-century constitution. The big debate for the future will be whether, when the matter eventually comes back on to the agenda, Australians should be considering a much more radical model in which the public would directly elect the head of state. 
This political matter aside-and many Australians clearly do dismiss it as mere politics-Australia is in a confident mood. The economy is strong, its recent reforms have cleared the decks for a prosperous few years as Asia's economies recover. And the advent of the Olympic games gives most Australians the feeling that anything the world can do, they can do as well, if not better. 
The general mood of confidence has its shadows, and these come mostly from abroad. The chaos of nearby Indonesia and the Australian intervention in East Timor have caused immediate concern to Mr Howard. Suddenly defence policy, on which spending had fallen to well below 2% of GDP, has become an issue. A bigger defence spend will mean less money for other priorities if the coalition wants to preserve the healthy budget surpluses that have been the pride of the government, elected in 1996. 
Australia's relationship with Indonesia, the cornerstone for decades of foreign policy, has deteriorated sharply, as both the government and the Labor opposition elevated East Timor from the bottom to the top of their international priorities. Bipartisan pragmatism had dominated relations with Indonesia; suddenly policy is getting a ""moral"" base. This new foreign policy will be dramatically and possibly dangerously tested if the fears of the pessimists are realised and Indonesia starts to break up, with parts such as Irian Jaya pressing for their independence. 
Australia enters the next century economically prosperous and confident. Despite dire predictions, it survived the Asian economic crisis with scarcely a scar. Economic restructuring in the 1980s and early 1990s-financial-sector reform, reducing tariffs and privatisation-will stand the country in good stead for 2000 and beyond. It is now inclined to lecture the Asia region on economic and financial rectitude. Growth continues to be strong; unemployment remains around 7%: only a few years ago it was 11%. 
In mid-2000 a new goods and services tax will begin operating. If the government wins the 2001 election it will have made dramatic tax history, having won an election (1998) on the promise of a new tax and then survived to tell the tale of implementing one. Now decisions are being made on a major overhaul of the business tax system-including reducing capital-gains tax and the company tax rate-to attract extra international capital, especially venture funds. 
There is a mood of optimism in the nation. Sydney's 2000 Olympic Games and the 2001 centenary of the six states joining in a federation will make for two years of world attention and local partying. The only other time Australia hosted the games was the 1956 Melbourne Olympics. Then, too, Australia was on a high, enjoying post-war prosperity and building a booming economy on a wave of migration. Now migration is at a low level, but Australia has become a truly multicultural nation, with the ""White Australia"" policy long abandoned, and with Sydney and Melbourne having large Asian communities. 
The raucous and racist One Nation Party, which signified the deep discontent of regional Australia in 1998, will have faded to a minor group by 2000. But the rural areas still feel squeezed and politically alienated, as population and services have drained away from the bush. Primary production, traditionally a big slice of Australia's wealth (especially export wealth) has become riskier. Australia has a touch of the two classes about it, based on geography. 
And on race. The plight of many Aborigines is the national shame, with blacks having high levels of infant mortality and shorter longevity than the general population. Too many Aborigines live on welfare. There are some bright spots: the increasing number of Aboriginal graduates; the election of Aden Ridgeway, an Aboriginal senator; and at the games, the nation's heart will be with Aboriginal athlete Cathy Freeman. 
Michelle Grattan: chief political correspondent, Sydney Morning Herald.  1999 After the corruption scandal that surrounded Salt Lake City's bid for the 2002 Winter Olympics, the Olympic movement can count itself lucky that the sports-mad Australians will do everything in their power to ensure that the Sydney 2000 Olympic Games (September 15th-October 1st) will be a success. One million Australians have already bought tickets. They can expect the 2000 Games to be a superbly organised, highly photogenic event, which will draw a worldwide television audience of 3.5 billion. 
By Olympic standards, the completion of Stadium Australia in the Sydney suburb of Homebush, over a year before the opening ceremony, was unprecedented. Once the Olympic flame finally gets to Sydney after its travels around the Pacific region, the stadium will be packed to its 110,000 capacity. In Atlanta 1996, the gold medal count was, United States: 101, Germany: 65, Russia: 63, China: 50, Australia: 41. As hosts, Australia will again excel, conforming to the formula for home success that is one part inspiration, two parts state injection of finances into sport. Australia is the most successful sporting nation in the world, if you measure its results against its 19m population. Sydney 2000 will act as the stage for established stars such as the women's 400m gold prospect Cathy Freeman and newcomers like the 16year-old wonderboy Ian Thorpe, who has a chance of three swimming medals. Watch out for the triathlon, though the swimming leg may be less exciting now that the authorities have guaranteed that there are no sharks in Sydney Harbour. 
Expect stirring performances from the Greeks where athletics has improved greatly since they won the Olympic bid for Athens in 2004. In the javelin, Mirela Manjani-Tzelili and Kostas Gatsioudis are stars in the making. Conversely, China has scaled down its athletic efforts since its rejection as host for 2000, but should at least achieve one ""track"" gold in the 50km walk. 
American sprinters and African distance runners will provide the classic excitement. The United States sprint trio of Michael Johnson, Maurice Greene and Marion Jones in five events (100m, 200m, long jump, and the 100m and 400m relays) will peak in Sydney. Ms Jones intends to go for a record five to better Karl Lewis's record of four sprint golds at Los Angeles 1984. She has already endeared herself to crowds everywhere and will be the face of the games. 
In the men's middle and distance events, the North and East Africans will carve up the medals between them. Classy Kenyan runners are plentiful and would win any long-distance relay race, but don't bet against the constantly improving Hicham El Gurrouj of Morocco in the 1,500m and the peerless Ethiopian Haile Gebrselassie in the 10,000m. For students of Olympic history, however, the place to be is at the rowing regatta, where the British oarsman Steve Redgrave, this time in the coxless fours, will be vying for his fifth gold medal in consecutive games, an unmatched achievement in any Olympic sport. 
Sydney's best advertisement is in the number of athletes who will decide to seek residence in the country. Already, four young Romanian wrestlers in Sydney for an Olympic test event have claimed asylum. Olympic officials say they are powerless to prevent athletes from trying to stay in Australia: ""The security fence at the Olympic Village is to keep people outnot to keep athletes in."" 
Matthew Glendinning: freelance sports and business writer.  1999 The Middle East enters the new century with the mould of the past generation cracking, if not yet breaking. Long years of Arab-Israeli conflict, involving five major wars since the foundation of the state of Israel in 1948, may now be drawing to an end, following the election in Israel of Ehud Barak and the relaunch of the regional peace process. A generation of Arab rulers-autocrats to a man even if their despotism has occasionally been benign-has started giving way to a new one, more susceptible to change and less burdened by the failures of their fathers. 
So why is there so little optimism to be found in the region? Mainly because no Arab country has lost its fear of, and innate hostility towards, Israel. This includes Egypt and Jordan, which have peace treaties with the Jewish state that emerged in their midst just over half a century ago. Paradoxically, only among the Palestinians-the people with most reason to resent Israel-can one find significant numbers of people who react with equanimity towards the Israelis. But Israelis themselves are in the main still deeply suspicious of Arabs in general and their Palestinian neighbours in particular. 
All this will be held mercilessly under the spotlight in the coming year. During that time, Israel and the Palestine Liberation Organisation (PLO) have undertaken to reach a ""final status"" treaty. Mr Barak also aims to reach peace with Syria by withdrawing from the Golan Heights-captured in the 1967 Arab-Israeli war and held against fierce counterattack in the 1973 war-and thereby allow Israeli troops to pull out of south Lebanon, where Israel has been trying to hold a buffer since 1978. 
Mr Barak, a former army chief-of-- staff at the head of a revamped Labour-- led alliance, plays the role of the thinking man's thug-tough on security, but thoughtful about the causes of Israel's insecurity. He believes, for instance, that Israel is weakened by its continuing occupation of Arab land. 
However, he did oppose the 1995 Oslo agreement on interim autonomy for the Palestinians; he is no peacenik. The PLO wants all of the West Bank and the Gaza strip-only 22% of Mandate Palestine-for an independent Palestinian state with occupied Arab east Jerusalem as its capital. Mr Barak has signalled he intends to hand over about 60% of the West Bank-little more than a tenth of historic Palestine. He has declared that none of Arab Jerusalem will be handed back, and no Palestinian refugees-3.6m registered by the urr in the occupied territories, Jordan, Syria and Lebanon, and 4.5m worldwide-can return. 
Scepticism about an enduring settlement with the Palestinians-- the heart of the Arab-Israeli conflict-is therefore amply justified. Doubly so, when the Syria-- Lebanon ""track"" of the peace process is likely to overtake the Palestinian ""track"". Negotiations with Damascus and its client in Beirut are essentially about security; Israel has no ideological claims on the Golan and south Lebanon, whereas religious Jews regard the West Bank as part of the Land of Israel given to them by God. Once the deal is done with the Syrian president, Hafez Assad, Yasser Arafat and his PLo will be isolated. Except in one explosive respect: the truly millennial issue of Jerusalem. 
Mr Barak wants this off the negotiating table, as though Arabs and Muslims could acquiesce in Israel's continuing occupation of the third holiest site in Islam, the Haram ash-Sharif in the Old City, with the Dome of the Rock and the ancient al-Aqsa mosque, a stone's throw from the Wailing Wall. Mr Arafat, great survivor though he is, could not give away Jerusalem-nor could any Arab or Muslim leader. 
Israel's initial plan was to make three Arab monarchs custodians of the holy sites, while retaining sovereignty: King Hussein of Jordan and King Hassan of Morocco, both of whom claimed descent from the Prophet Mohammed, and King Fahd of Saudi Arabia, protector of the holy cities of Mecca and Medina. King Hussein and King Hassan died in 1999, while King Fahd like many of his Arab peers is seriously ill. There was, in any event, no indication that the three would have co-operated. To have done so would have undermined their legitimacy. 
Legitimacy is, in any case, in short supply, highlighted by Arab leaders' seeming need to reassure themselves with 90-99% majorities in spurious plebiscites in countries that include Syria, Iraq, Egypt, Tunisia and Yemen. Republican regimes in the region, paradoxically, appear to have worse dynastic problems than the absolute monarchies most of them replaced. The successions in Jordan, Morocco and Bahrain, and the incipient succession in Saudi Arabia, appear to be going fairly smoothly. By contrast, there are doubts about who will succeed the republican masters of Syria and Iraq. President Assad appears to be grooming his young and untried son, Bashar. Saddam Hussein has long given free rein to his murderous and racketeering sons, Uday and Qusay. Even if there were a peace settlement with Israel, these problems of legitimacy in the Arab world would remain. 
David Gardner: Middle East editor For the Financial Times.  1999 With the aged King Fahd so obviously ill and incapacitated, the transfer of power to the elderly, but less frail, Crown Prince Abdullah will be eagerly watched. He will take over a kingdom not yet in crisis but facing serious economic and social problems that oil earnings-greatly reduced from a decade ago-can no longer disguise. He will need to respond to the discontent of a generation of young people which has grown up amid oil wealth and for which the prospect of unemployment or low-paid work comes as a shock. The Kingdom's young will grow steadily more vocal. 
But those hoping for bold reforms will be disappointed. Fear of popular anger will ensure that the authorities delay the reforms needed to place the economy and state finances on a sustainable footing, and reduce the kingdom's overwhelming dependence on oil. The strength of oil prices in 2000 will provide some, albeit temporary, financial leeway, curbing the current-account deficit and boosting growth. Rather than liberalising the economy and wooing foreign investment, the government will concentrate on mobilising private Saudi capital to invest in new projects. 
Such caution will stem from the royal family's concern that cuts in state welfare could prompt disaffected Saudis to rally behind calls for a brand of Islamist nationalism that blames the country's ills on its political system. This potential will be accentuated by Saudi's increasing access to information on the Internet, and to the controversial talk shows broadcast by Qatar's uncensored Al-Jazeera satellite television channel. On this channel contentious issues, such as the foreign military presence and the state of the economy, get freely aired. The social liberalisation that is so apparent in the Gulf states will put serious pressure on the kingdom's moral rectitude. Yesterday's threat was Islamic extremism, tomorrow's will be a burgeoning young population that wants western-style reforms.  1999 For much of Latin America it will be a year of economic recovery. Growth for the region as a whole should reach 3-4%. This marks an improvement on 1999's sharp recession, which saw output fall by perhaps 1%, the worst performance in a decade. In South America, recovery will be steady rather than swift. Mexico escaped the recession because of its links with the United States' economy, but that in turn makes it vulnerable to any sharp slowdown north of the border. 
The region's economic performance will not be strong enough to sweep away the creeping political disillusion with market economics. But neither will the broad liberal reforms of the past decade be abandoned wholesale: some, such as privatisation, will continue, as will (Venezuela perhaps excepted) openness to foreign trade and investment. And as fiscal constraints ease somewhat, governments will pay more attention to social spending. 
The pace of recovery depends partly on outside factors, such as renewed growth in Europe and Asia offsetting a slowdown in the United States, and thus helping to boost prices for Latin America's commodity exports. Any sharp rise in American interest rates would hurt South America, too. But the key to recovery lies with Brazil (which accounts for two-fifths of Latin American cnr). President Fernando Henrique Cardoso faces the challenge of holding his fractious coalition together despite his own deep unpopularity (prompted by the January 1999 devaluation) and the distraction of October's municipal elections. 
That means the government will make little progress with structural reform in taxes, pensions and public finances. But a strong rival to Mr Cardoso is unlikely to emerge. Instead, Brazil will muddle through (as it has done for much of the 500 years since the Portuguese arrived there, an anniversary it will commemorate in April). The government should manage to keep reasonably tight control over public spending. That, together with improvised revenue-raising measures, will allow it to meet, more or less, the fiscal targets agreed with the iMF, and its own target of 4% growth, helped by an increase, at last, in exports, as they respond to devaluation. 
Recovery in Brazil will help its neighbours in the Mercosur trade block. Presidential elections in Argentina, Chile and Uruguay in the final months of 1999 were likely to usher in presidents of the centre-left in each country. Of the three, Argentina's Fernando de la Rua, a cautious radical, inherits the trickiest challenge. Argentina's rigid exchange-rate peg to the dollar was the cause of its rollercoaster economic progress during the 1990s under Carlos Menem. But if the arrangement is to survive (Brazil and Chile abandoned their less rigid currency pegs during 1999), Mr de la Rua will have to move quickly to lower business costs through fiscal, labour and anti-monopoly reforms. For these, he will need Mr Menem's support, since he will lack a congressional majority. Even if he fails, a weaker dollar might still let Argentina off its self-imposed hook. Otherwise it will face an unpalatable choice: adopting the dollar outright, or a devaluation that would be more traumatic than Brazil's. Each would constrain growth. 
The main threat to Latin American democracy will remain in the northern Andes. Colombia's civil wars will escalate. The army's new anti-drugs battalion, trained and financed by the United States, will enter combat against the leftwing guerrillas (but not the right-wing paramilitaries, even though both groups have links with the drug trade). America will pump money and, perhaps, military advisers, into helping President Andres Pastrana's government, but will not send in its own troops. The guerrillas may respond by using missiles against government aircraft. Peace talks will not be formally broken off, but will get nowhere. Slowly the guerrillas will start losing the war. 
In Venezuela, President Hugo Chavez will win a referendum approving his new constitution, and go on to get himself reelected in a fresh presidential election, in the sixth national vote in 18 months. Higher oil prices mean the economy may temporarily recover, prolonging Mr Chavez's popularity. But his regime will be marked by populist gestures and creeping militarism. In Ecuador, general political chaos could see President Jamil Mahuad not only unable to nail down the iMF's support but overthrown by Congress, with a subsequent search for a strongman in the Chavez mould. Yet even so, constitutional appearances would probably be preserved. That is the fashion pioneered by another elected authoritarian, Peru's Alberto Fujimori, who since 1990 has successfully reformed his country's economy in a way Mr Chavez seems unlikely to do. Having brushed off legal objections to his candidacy, Mr Fujimori will try for a third term as president in April. Renewed economic growth, his government's influence over the media and the opposition's weakness ought to guarantee Mr Fujimori victory. But Peruvian voters, often unpredictable, may suddenly decide they have tired of him, and turn to Luis Castaneda Lossio, a canny centrist. 
In Cuba, Fidel Castro does not allow such uncertainties. His dictatorship will survive yet another year. The United States will relax its 40-year trade embargo against Cuba, allowing food and medicine sales into the country. But do not expect any liberalising gestures from Mr Castro in return. 
Michael Reid: Americas editor, The Economist.  1999 Chile's reborn democracy is limbering up for its tenth birthday in March 2000, battered and bruised from hefty blows in the previous two years. The extradition proceedings against General Augusto Pinochet, a former dictator, have reopened old political wounds. And the economy is still suffering from the effects of the emerging markets' crisis and the adverse weather that accompanied El Nino. In an attempt to revive output and employment, the government has allowed the fiscal accounts to slip into the red for the first time in 13 years. 
There is work to be done if Chile is to shake off its recent grogginess. The new government, which takes office in March, following an election in December, will have little time to enjoy the anniversary celebrations. Continued co-operation between the right and left will be crucial to maintain the consensus which has formed the cornerstone of Chile's economic success during the 1990s. Whatever the outcome of the Pinochet extradition saga, complete national reconciliation will be achieved only once the past is revisited without fear of recrimination. 
On the economic front, the first set of challenges for the new government appears straightforward. Given an improving external environment, relaxed monetary conditions and a low basis of comparison, GDr growth could reach 5% in 2000, while moderate import prices and spare capacity will restrain inflation. 
But to convince investors that it has truly returned to winning ways, Chile will need to overcome two stronger challenges: rebalancing the fiscal accounts; and restraining consumption to keep the currentaccount deficit at a sustainable level over the medium term. Success in both these areas would pave the way in 2000 for faster growth and development, and confirm Chile's (unofficial) status as Latin America's top-rank performer.  1999 Africa will amble through 2000 with an uneven gait. Its athletes will sweep up plenty of medals at the Olympic Games, again showing their world calibre. African footballers will score many goals in the Euro 2000 football championship. But many African economies will barely hobble past the starting line, compared with their competitors in Asia and Latin America. The brave hopes for an African economic revival have foundered as several regions' conflicts-in Ethiopia-Eritrea, Sudan, the giant Democratic Republic of Congo and Angola-have drawn in many of their neighbours. 
A tough triumvirate of African leaders will try to end the chaos. South Africa's Thabo Mbeki, Nigeria's Olusegun Obasanjo and Algeria's Abdelaziz Bouteflika will cajole Africa's warring states into negotiations and peace deals. They will dominate Africa's continental club, the Organisation of African Unity (oAU). With their good political and diplomatic track-records, the three will be taken seriously in Africa and in the West. 
Their priority in 2000 is to consolidate a tentative peace in Congo. Closely related to this is the need to put new pressure on Jose dos Santos's government and Jonas Savimbi's UNITa rebels to end the latest round of Angola's 25year civil war. But progress here requires them to convince the uN Security Council to send international troops to Angola alongside local African peacekeepers. Angola and Congo will be the weariest of the world's warring states by 2000, and therein lies hope. 
Apart from diplomacy, Mr Bouteflika and Mr Obasanjo will be busy at home. Both are veterans of their countries' Byzantine politics; both returned to power in 1999, inheriting deeply fractured societies and weakened states. Algeria and Nigeria have enough gas and oil to finance much of their own economic recovery and to bring in foreign capital for the rest. They will be helped by the upswing in oil prices. Along with South Africa, they will be the key countries to watch for signs of any genuine African revival. 
Another prominent African, the urr secretary-general, Kofi Annan, will spend much of 2000 thinking about his troubled continent. The scheduled referendum on Western Sahara's independence in July will be a major test. Can the urr prevent a re-run of East Timor in North Africa? Certainly Morocco's new King Mohammed VI is no more eager to countenance losing the referendum than was Indonesia's General Wiranto in East Timor. The most likely outcome in Western Sahara is, therefore, continued Moroccan obstructionism. Perhaps the Libyan leader, Colonel Muammar Gadaffi, who talks to both Morocco and the pro-independence Polisario Front, will offer to mediate. Either way, expect to hear plenty about Western Sahara in 2000. It will be on every foreign editor's list. 
Egypt, Africa's fourth heavyweight, will grow at some 5% and its stockmarket even faster. A parliamentary election must be held in Egypt by November 2000. But do not expect much change as a result. To little surprise, President Hosni Mubarak was elected to a fourth six-year term by a familiar huge majority in September 1999. Exuding a pharaonic interest in the rest of Africa, President Mubarak will host a grand Europe-Africa summit in Cairo in April which promises to go beyond the usual pious hopes. Britain and France will make much of their new entente cordiale in Africa. 
Mr Mubarak is also keeping a close watch on Sudan and Somalia. Much as he distrusts the Islamist regime in Khartoum, which backed an attempt to kill him in 1995, Mr Mubarak does not want to see it forced to concede an independent Southern Sudan. That would challenge Cairo's control of the Nile. But the Khartoum regime will face a new wave of regional and international pressure to end its war with the south that has claimed more than 2m lives in 30 years. In Somalia, there will be almost no outside pressure, except from regional predators such as Egypt and Ethiopia. The rest of the world is still faintly embarrassed by the failure of the multi-billion-dollar efforts to intervene in the country. Somalia will show the world one thing in 2000: that it is quite possible to have a nation without any semblance of a government to run it. Across the continent, Charles Taylor's regime in Liberia is also a proponent of small government and big militias. Mr Taylor and his ally Blaise Compaore of Burkina Faso will show that gangster politics is still pervasive in Africa. 
Democracy spreads 
A trio of more constitutionally minded governments along West Africa's coast-Cote d'Ivoire, Ghana and Senegal-face elections in 2000. Incumbents Henri Konan-Bedie and Abdou Diouf are odds-on favourites to win in Cote d'Ivoire and Senegal. Ghana's poll is harder to read. Jerry Rawlings, an ex-military leader and elected president, may confound the sceptics and step down after his statutory two terms. If he does such an unAfrican thing, he will set an example to the continent and his well-resourced National Democratic Congress Party should win. 
Successions will also dominate politics in Kenya and Zimbabwe where presidents Daniel arap Moi and Robert Mugabe must leave by 2002. Neither leader seems inclined to go. Neither has yet indicated successors. Both have aged badly. For the first time since independence in 1980, Mr Mugabe will face a serious opposition party, the Movement for Democratic Change, in parliamentary elections in mid2000. Most hopefully, both countries have a bright new generation of African entrepreneurs-working in information technology and telecommunicadons-who are launching companies on western stock exchanges. 
Both Tanzania and Namibia are on the up. They go to the polls in 2000 and will probably re-elect the incumbent parties of presidents Benjamin Mkapa and Sam Nujoma (even though Mr Nujoma had to change his country's liberal constitution to squeeze in a third term for himself). Promised elections in GuineaBissau are more problematic. The regime came to power after a coup. But elections in nearby Niger, which has a similar history, passed off in 1999 without trouble. 
Africa's coup-makers will find life tougher in 2000. Under Algerian President Bouteflika's chairmanship, the onu is to expel all regimes which come to power through force of arms, discreetly casting a veil over the political history of most of the continent's governments. 
Patrick Smith: editor, Africa Confidential.  1999 On July 2nd Mexico will hold a presidential election that will be the most hotly contested-and fairest-in its history. For the past 70 years, under the rule of the Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI), power has changed hands through backroom deals; before that, it was often by the passage of arms. Now, the voters will be the arbiters. And they will probably choose to keep the PRi in power for another six years. 
Such an outcome is far from automatic. Thanks to the setting up of an independent electoral authority, and Mexico's slow but steady democratisation, the opposition has its bestever chance of winning. But the opposition is divided, between the socially conservative freemarketeers of the National Action Party (rAN) and the left-of-centre Party of the Democratic Revolution (PRD). Efforts to unite them behind a single candidate will fail. 
Even without an opposition coalition, the PAN's Vicente Fox, a charismatic campaigner and former manager for Coca-Cola, could still mount a powerful challenge. Even so, provided the ruling party avoids splits, a narrow PRI victory is the likeliest outcome, not least because the party's influence over the media and its scope for making handouts to poorer voters still give it a residual advantage. 
But assuming it does win, which Par will it be? Certainly not the party of old, in which the outgoing president named his successor, whose victory was then assured. In November 1999, the PRi chose its candidate in its first-ever open primary election. 
The intense power battle within the rai could spark violence (as in 1994, when its presidential candidate and general-secretary were both murdered). The election will strain the stability of Mexico's still-evolving democracy and market economy. The defences look stronger than in 1994 (when for the fifth time in a row, presidential succession was accompanied by devaluation), but talk of Mexico gaining an investment-grade credit rating sounds premature until the next presidency is well settled. 
The economy will be hurt by any slowdown in the United States. It could still be badly shaken by political turmoil. But for all these caveats, Mexico in 2000 will start to look (not before time) like a modern, democratic country, driven by a powerful (and even fairly free) economy. In a country whose capacity for cruelty and chaos is greater than most, there is every reason to believe that 2000 will be a cathartic year of change. 
Students of Mexico quickly learn to enjoy paradox. There will be plenty about. A party that was often hated when it ruthlessly clung to power may now be popularly and freely returned to office. Mr Zedillo, who came to office as a colourless technocrat by the chance of a bullet, will have delivered far more radical reform than his macho predecessors. And a country that for many years relied on a folkloric hatred of America for its social cohesion will discover that it has surreptitiously learnt the gringo's tricks of capitalism and democracy, to its own considerable advantage. 
Whoever he may be, Mexico's next president will be weaker than his predecessors, forced to deal (as Mr Zedillo has been for the second half of his mandate) with a Congress in which no party has a majority. He will have to grapple, too, with intractable social inequalities. 
After a decade of warmth, Mexico's relations with the United States could become decidedly cooler, if economic problems north of the border were to spill over into trade disputes, adding to the rising tensions over the illegal drug trade. But NAFTa will survive. Indeed, it is steadily changing Mexico in ways that are already bordering on irreversible.  1999 As with human health, so with national conflict: prevention is better and cheaper than intervention, argues Kofi Annan, secretary-general of the United Nations. 
In the past 20 years we have understood the need for military intervention where governments grossly violate human rights and the international order. In the next 20 years we must learn how to prevent conflicts as well as how to intervene in them. Even the costliest policy of prevention is far cheaper, in lives and in resources, than the least expensive intervention. 
This is why we have been pressing the international community to take prevention more seriously. In cost-benefit terms the case for doing this is compelling. A recent study by the Carnegie Commission on Preventing Deadly Conflict estimated that the cost to the international community of the seven major wars in the 1990s, not including Kosovo and East Timor, was $199 billion. Add in these two conflicts and $230 billion seems a likely figure. 
Effective prevention could have saved most of this huge sum. More important, it could have saved hundreds of thousands of lives. 
Time and again, differences are allowed to develop into disputes and disputes allowed to develop into deadly conflicts. Time and again, warning signs are ignored and pleas for help overlooked. Only after the deaths and the destruction do we intervene at a far higher human and material cost, by which time there are fewer lives left to save. Only when it is too late, it seems, do we value prevention. 
There are, in my view, three main reasons for the failure of prevention when prevention so clearly is possible. First, the reluctance of one or more of the parties to a conflict to accept external intervention of any kind. Second, the lack of political will at the highest levels of the international community. Third, a lack of integrated conflict-prevention strategies within the uN system and the international community. Of all these, the will to act is the most important. Without the political will to act when action is needed, no amount of improved coordination or early warning will translate awareness into action. 
The founders of the uN drew up its charter with a sober view of human nature. They had witnessed the ability of humanity to wage a war of unparalleled brutality and unprecedented cruelty. They had witnessed, above all, the failure of prevention, when prevention was, throughout the 1930s, still possible and every signal pointed to war. 
Of course, as realists we must also recognise that in some cases the sheer intractability of conflicts and the obduracy of the warring parties will make intervention unlikely to succeed. But even wars that cannot be stopped once started might well have been avoided with effective preventive policies. 
We are under no illusion that preventive strategies will be easy to implement. For a start, the costs of prevention have to be paid in the present, while its benefits lie in the distant future. And the benefits are not tangible-when prevention succeeds, nothing happens. Taking such a political risk when there are few obvious rewards requires conviction and considerable vision. 
Second, there are real institutional barriers to the institutional co-operation that prevention requires. In national governments and international agencies, departments responsible for security tend to know little about development or governance; those responsible for the latter rarely think of them in security terms. Identifying such constraints is not a counsel of despair. It is a necessary, if not sufficient, condition for progress. 
The UN has long argued that good governance, democratisation, respect for human rights and policies for equitable and sustainable development are the best form of long-term conflict prevention. The changing patterns of global conflict and governance in recent years, particularly with respect to democratisation, provide ample evidence to support our conviction. 
More votes, less war 
During the 1990s there has been a remarkable and little-noticed reduction in global warfare. More old wars have ended than new ones begun. Between 1989 and 1992 on average eight new ethnic wars began each year; today the average is two a year. Between 1992 and 1998 the scope and intensity of armed conflict around the world declined by about a third. The number of democratically elected governments increased by about the same proportion. 
We cannot leap to the conclusion that the increase in the number of democracies has caused the decrease in warfare. Other factors, such as the end of the cold war, surely also played a role (although the two are obviously related). 
But the evidence is in line with the well-established, if little publicised, finding that democracies have far lower levels of internal violence than nondemocracies. This is not really surprising. The non-violent management of conflict is the very essence of democracy. In an era when more than 90% of wars take place within, not between, states, the import of this finding far conflict prevention should be obvious. 
Prevention is no panacea. It requires that governments act in good faith and place the welfare of citizens above narrow sectional interests. But we know that some conflict-prone governments see prevention policies, particularly those which stress democratisation and good governance, as a threat to their own power and privilege. For that reason, they are likely to reject them. 
The fact that prevention will not work everywhere is an argument against naive optimism, but not against actively supporting democratisation, good governance and other preventive policies. These are not only important goods in their own right. They are also among the most potent and costeffective antidotes to the scourge of war.  1999 Water shortages will grow ever more serious; the stuff of future wars. Levels in aquifers, the underground layers of porous rock which hold most of the world's supply of fresh water, are dropping. By 2025, there will not be enough water to supply the basic needs of 18 nations, including Iran, Iraq, Afghanistan, Israel, Jordan and the Palestine area. Look out for tension between Turkey, Syria and Iraq over the Euphrates and between Egypt, Sudan and Ethiopia over the Nile. With 3.5 billion people affected by water shortages by 2050, conditions are ripe for a century of water conflicts. Curiously, these may well begin in the rich world. Canada is getting upset about losing its water to America. And within America quarrels between the states will grow more acute.  1999 Five main issues will dominate European Union business in 2000. The first will be trade. A new millennium round of world trade talks, launched in Seattle in November 1999, will mean a fierce and deserved assault on the Eu's protectionist farm policies. America, Australia and New Zealand will lead the attack. 
The Eu has no good arguments left to justify its farm subsidies, which cost taxpayers about $50 billion each year (half the Eu budget). They survive mainly because governments fear to offend riotprone Mediterranean farmers. All eyes will be on the defensive tactics devised by the Eu's newly appointed trade commissioner, Pascal Lamy, a Frenchman. France is the most instinctively protectionist country in the Eu. It is the staunchest defender (and, not coincidentally, the largest recipient) of farm subsidies. But Mr Lamy may yet surprise. Some say the new president of the European Commission, Romano Prodi, gave him the trade job because it will take a Frenchman to persuade France to accept a farm deal that includes the necessary cuts in subsidies. 
Second on the agenda is the need for administrative reform. The owlish Mr Prodi has promised to purge the European Commission of sleaze and waste, following the shamefaced resignation in March 1999 of the previous commission led by Jacques Santer. Reform is also necessary to cope with new members, mostly from Central and Eastern Europe. The Eu institutions-mainly, the European Commission and the Council of Ministers-were designed for six member states. A few tweaks have helped them accommodate a current membership of 15. But with the prospect of at least a dozen more countries joining the Union in the coming ten years, changes of substance will be needed. 
This will mean a new au treaty. To prepare it, governments will send ministers or ambassadors to a constitutional conference that will begin in the first half of the year, when Portugal holds the Eu presidency, and which will end in the second half of the year, when France is in charge. The talks must agree to cap the number of European commissioners at the present 20 (or less), however many more countries join the Union. The commission is the Eu's civil service. The commissioners who head it also have a strong policymaking role. At present, big countries send two commissioners each to Brussels and small countries send one. The big countries are resigned to losing their second commissioners as part of the effort to cut numbers. The question is how to persuade the small countries to accept a new system in which at least some of them may have no commissioners at all. 
A way must also be found to allocate voting power more fairly in the Council of Ministers. This body (and not the European Parliament, despite its name) is the Eu's legislature. Big countries have more votes in the council than small ones: the minister representing France has ten votes, his counterpart from Luxembourg has two. But additions to the council down the years have been dealt with ad hoc, and inequalities have accumulated. Governments need to agree on general rules for voting power when any new country joins. 
A new treaty must also widen qualified majority voting in the Council of Ministers. The more countries join the Eu, the more national vetoes may be wielded. That argues for taking more big decisions by qualified majority voting. (Qualified means that more than a simple majority is needed to pass a law. The present formula demands 62 votes out of a possible 85.) But opinions differ sharply as to the areas where more majority voting should be used. 
The Eu must keep sight of its third big bit of business in 2000: the enlargement process itself. Of the 12 countries recognised as possible new members (13 if Turkey is added), the six most promising will complete a first phase of negotiations with the European Commission by the summer. Each will have measured its national legislation minutely against all Eu legislation, and will have drawn up a plan for dealing with shortfalls. But each will have a few last points on which it wants special treatment-a waiver to run a heavily polluting power station, or permission to bar foreigners from buying farmland. These differences are meant to be settled in the second half of the year. 
The closer the first candidates edge towards readiness (Estonia, Poland and Hungary will probably be the leaders), the greater the pressure on Eu governments to give firm dates for entry. Even the most polite countries in the queue are losing their patience. They say that the longer entry dates are withheld, the harder it becomes for them to keep up the momentum of reforms needed to deliver on their side of the bargain. 
The fourth big Eu project for 2000 will be a charter of fundamental rights for all Eu citizens. This will be drafted by a diverse committee of worthies and reviewed by national leaders at a summit in December 2000. It is hard to say in advance how much impact this document will have. It may be just flimflam. It may have all sorts of practical consequences if the rights it enshrines are enforceable directly in law. In Brussels jargon, the charter of rights is meant to bring the Eu closer to the citizen. And too bad for the citizen who craves only the right to keep his distance. 
The final theme for 2000 will be that of European defence, a theme so important that it is dealt with separately in the article that follows. 
Robert Cottrell: EU correspondent for The Economist.  1999 In the coming year, the European Union will move decisively on to new terrain: it will adopt a common and assertive defence policy. In December 2000, at the Eu's Paris summit, heads of government will endorse a plan to give the Eu a military organisation. The Western European Union, a defence club of ten states that is currently semi-detached from the Eu, will be merged with it. The Eu will then be able to undertake small-scale military missions in its own name. 
The rationale of these plans is that Eu diplomacy would carry more weight if underpinned by the ability to deploy force. The initiative is not only about new European institutions, but also more capable armed forces. The Kosovo war reminded Eu governments that they cannot do a great deal without American support. They lack sophisticated command, control and communication systems; enough ships and aircraft for transporting men and equipment; precision-guided weaponry; and the airborne surveillance systems which can monitor events on the ground. 
Thus in the autumn of 1999, when the British government proposed that the Eu should adopt ""defence performance goals"" as a means of improving military capabilities, most other Eu governments welcomed the idea. The point of these performance goals would not be to get Eu states to increase defence budgets, since that is not politically feasible. It would rather be to encourage governments to spend their defence budgets more wisely. 
At present, for example, the combined defence budgets of the Eu governments amount to about half of the $290 billion that the United States spends on defence. But their ability to project force, away from home, is perhaps 10% that of the United States. Too many European governments spend their budgets on large conscript armies, rather than modern equipment and training. Governments need to keep their soldiers at a higher state of readiness; to provide them with the means to be mobile; and to be able to sustain them at a distance. 
Thus Eu defence ministers will agree to set goals (both for the Eu as a whole and for individual countries) on, for example, the numbers of soldiers they could deploy outside the NaTO area, and the length of time for which the force could be sustained. The Eu will not attempt to enforce these targets through centrally set rules. But there will be a process of peer review and exchange of best practice, perhaps supervised by the Eu's new high representative for foreign and defence policy, Javier Solana. 
Britain and France (which is introducing a professional army) already perform quite well; many other Eu countries do not. The Germans have a particular problem, with a large, ill-equipped conscript army that is geared to territorial defence. The leading role of Britain's prime minister, Tony Blair, in this defence initiative is crucial, for the British will have to convince the Americans that European defence is good for the Atlantic alliance. The British must point out to the Americans that the initiative is not designed to weaken NATO. For the Eu is unlikely to act on its own, unless the Americans do not wish to take part in a military enterprise. For example, if the Europeans wished to rescue Eu nationals from a civil war in North Africa, or to deploy peacekeepers in part of the Balkans, Americans might easily decline to take part. The Eu would then take political responsibility for such a mission, while using some of NATO's assets and command structures. 
The French like to talk about the Eu acting ""autonomously"" (a word that annoys the Americans), but even they do not want the Eu to build military organisations that duplicate what NATO does; they know the Europeans do not have the money. Many American policymakers admit to being in two minds about European defence. On the one hand, they would welcome a Europe that could do more militarily, and thus be of more help to the United States when it tries to sort out world crises. On the other, they worry that a more effective European foreign and security policy would sometimes oppose American interests. 
In practice the United States has little choice but to support this European defence initiative, while asking that its particular concerns be addressed (for example, that Turkey, in NaTO but not the Eu, should not be excluded from the new European defence arrangements). For if it opposed European defence in general, or vetoed the use of NATO assets to support the Eu on a particular occasion, this would prompt the Europeans to build military structures that were independent of NaTO, rather than closely linked to it. The United States will almost certainly bless the new European defence arrangements, when they are unveiled in Paris in December 2000. 
The role of individual politicians in making a success of this initiative will be crucial. George Robertson, NATO's secretary-general, Mr Solana, the Eu's high representative, and Chris Patten, the European commissioner for foreign policy, are all pro-European and committed Atlanticists. They will have to make the ""Common Foreign and Security Policy"" effective. And they must convince European governments, as well as Washington, that a strong European security policy is compatible with a solid Atlantic alliance and could even strengthen it. 
Charles Grant: director of the Centre for European Reform.  1999 France will enter a new century as convinced as ever of ""the French exception"", that blend of history and revolutionary culture which the French believe makes them unique-or, as foreigners sometimes reckon, simply awkward. The result will be a year of frequent irritation between France and its allies: there will be rows with America over the ""millennium round"" agenda of the World Trade Organisation; and with the European Commission and fellow members of the European Union over state aids, market access, institutional reform and the pace of the Eu's expansion eastwards. 
Indeed, when France assumes the Eu's rotating presidency in the second half of the year, its central role may increase rather than lessen the frictions. Yet it would be wrong to exaggerate France's awkwardness. On defence, for example, France is well aware, especially after the wars in the Gulf and in Kosovo, of its deficiencies, and so will lead the drive for a co-ordinated European capability. In this, it will build on the agreement reached with Britain at St Malo in December 1998. 
Moreover, many of the irritants in France's outward behaviour will stem from the histrionic nature of its domestic politics, in particular the campaign for the presidential election due in May 2002. President Jacques Chirac, a conservative, is determined to win a second seven-year term; the Socialist prime minister, Lionel Jospin, is determined to thwart Mr Chirac by winning the election for himself and his left-wing coalition. 
This ""cohabitation"" of a president and prime minister in opposition to each other is something French voters have seemingly grown fond of. A charitable explanation is that it forces politics to seek a middle ground; a cynical explanation is that it forestalls much needed reforms-of the tax system, for example, or education or trade union powersthat voters might individually find uncomfortable. 
Whatever the explanation, one of the big tests for Mr Jospin in the coming few months will be the implementation, from January 1st 2000, of a programme that helped win the left's surprise victory in 1997: the 35-hour week for firms employing 20 or more people (smaller firms will have to implement it from 2002). Rather than taking on new workers-the purpose of the programme-employers have tended to react by investing in productivity-raising technology. The consequence is that unemployment has stubbornly remained at over a tenth of the workforce. 
Mr Jospin claims this will change as robust economic growth (forecast at perhaps 3% in 2000) continues. If he is wrong, however there is likely to be a severe backlash from disappointed workers-and damage to several political reputations, especially that of the left-wing labour minister, Martine Aubry. By contrast, the influence of France's employers would increase. In any event, more follies of this kind are unlikely from the Jospin government. 
The debate, however, somewhat misses the point. France remains one of the most state-dominated nations in the Eu, with a costly welfare state (obligatory social charges are around 45% of GDP, compared with about 35% in America), a large public sector and a generous provision of public services. It is this structure, with its rhetoric of ""solidarity"" between social classes, that helps identify the ""French exception"". 
Yet the truth is that France is becoming less exceptional. The nationalisations of the early Mitterrand years have been transformed into a sustained programme of privatisation from which few state firms-not even France Telecom-have been exempted. Indeed Renault, once an emblem of the state sector, has become a private-sector leader confident enough not just to take control of Japan's Nissan but to cut a swathe through its workforce. Meanwhile, hostile takeover bids are no longer inconceivable. French companies, such as Vivendi, seize markets overseas; and stock-options are the required reward of a new generation of senior managers. 
In other words, for all the strikes-by the left, by the students, by the farmers, and by other interest groups-that are a commonplace of French politics, and for all the populist rhetoric against business, France, it seems, is stealthily adopting some Anglo-Saxon habits.  1999 The Germans are in a paradoxical mood. They say they want reforms, but then rebel against the measures needed to achieve them. Most of them understand that public spending is too high. They have been told over and over again that the public debt has tripled since the fall of the Berlin Wall, and is now above the limit imposed by membership of the European currency union. But presented with a tax-and-spending reform package designed to take DM30 billion ($16.5 billion) off the budget for 2000, they have demonstrated their distaste at the ballot box. In a string of regional and local elections in the autumn of 1999, they have given a mighty drubbing to the ruling Social Democrats and their coalition partners, the Greens. Worse could be to come if the voters in North Rhine-Westphalia abandon their long-standing support for the Social Democrats in key regional elections in May 2000. With nearly 18m people, this state has nearly a quarter of Germany's population. Cassandras are already muttering that if North Rhine-Westphalia goes, then so must the chancellor, Gerhard Schroder. 
It all looked very different in September 1998 when Mr Schroder won a famous victory over the Christian Democrat Chancellor Helmut Kohl, a veteran heavyweight who had lasted 16 years in office. True, in order to get a working majority Mr Schroder had to enter a coalition with the small Green Party, a combination that had never before been tried at federal level, and was clearly going to involve some compromises. Fortunately, the Greens' star turn, Joschka Fischer, who demanded and got the foreign ministry, turned out to be both more reasonable and more capable than many of his new colleagues had feared. He also proved a hit with the public: he is now well ahead of the chancellor himself in opinion polls. Unfortunately his party's popularity with the public is on the wane, casting doubt on the coalition's long-term viability. 
The main problem for Mr Schroder so far, however, has come not from the Greens but from the ranks of his own party. In March 1999, only six months into the new government's term of office, Oskar Lafontaine, the finance minister and Social Democratic Party chairman, resigned from his post after a series of stormy disagreements with the chancellor. But out of office has not meant out of sight or mind: Mr Lafontaine has styled himself as the defender of his party's traditional left-wing values, and continues to snipe at the chancellor from the sidelines. His successor as finance minister, Hans Eichel, is a less mercurial character, and much closer to Mr Schroder. He is widely thought to have made a good start in his job, but his detractors maintain he has the charisma of a paper clip. 
Mr Schroder came to office on the promise of delivering a ""new centre"", a somewhat vague concept apparently similar to the ""third way"" successfully pursued by Britain's prime minister, Tony Blair. The two leaders seem to enjoy slapping each other's backs in public, but many of their similarities are only skin-deep. Mr Blair took over as leader of the Labour Party well ahead of the election that brought him to power in May 1997, which gave him time to shape it in his image. Mr Schroder, by contrast, was chosen as the Social Democrats' candidate for the chancellorship only a few months before the 1998 election, so his party remained unreformed and his relationship with the trade unions unresolved. Large chunks of his party are uncomfortable with his attempts to get closer to business, and disapprove of his reform plans. 
For good measure, Mr Schroder is also having more trouble with the Christian Democratic opposition than his majority in the lower house of parliament, the Bundestag, seemed to indicate. The regional-election defeats the Social Democrats suffered during 1999 have lost them the majority they held in the upper house, the Bundesrat, which matters because Bundesrat approval is required for all major financial legislation, including the proposed budget-reform package. 
So will the Christian Democrats play hard to get? They must be tempted. After all, in their last few years in power they themselves were trying to introduce similar reforms, and were thwarted by the Social Democrat opposition which at that time had a majority in the Bundesrat. In blocking these reforms, the Social Democrats introduced a new word into the German vocabulary: Reformstau (reform logjam). The Christian Democrats, having publicly acknowledged the need for reforms, may not want to cast themselves in such an obstructionist role, so the chances are that they will allow through at least some of the budget reforms (but extract concessions in return). 
If he can get his budget through, Mr Schroder's fortunes may yet improve. The German economy, after growing by less than 1.5% in 1999, looks set for 2.5% or more in 2000, thanks partly to strong exports. Despite Germany's image as an economic tortoise-slow to abandon excessive regulation and introduce market reform-a great deal of restructuring has been going on behind the scenes that is beginning to make industry leaner and fitter. Investment looks set to pick up. Inflation has almost disappeared from the radar screen, but private consumption will remain hesitant, because unemployment-which today's Germans care more deeply about than any other economic issue-is likely to remain above 10%. And that figure is an average for Germany as a whole. In former East Germany, which remains stubbornly poorer and less productive than former West Germany, unemployment is double that in the west, at over 17%. 
There is more cheer to be had from contemplating Germany's place in the wider world. During NaTO's intervention in Kosovo in the spring of 1999, Mr Schroder reassured his partners by his clear commitment to the cause and by his ability to keep his pacifist-minded Green coalition partner on board. Looking ahead, Germany is expected to play a prominent part in the negotiations for enlarging the European Union to the east that are now getting under way. More broadly, the Germans> after decades of trying to live down their recent history, are becoming more self-confident: twothirds of them think that the past is becoming less important and that their country, with 82m people and much the biggest economy of any Eu member, should play a leading European role. With the government's move from Bonn to Berlin now more or less complete, 2000 will be the first year in half a century when a German government has operated from a ""permanent"" rather than a ""provisional"" capital. 
If there were to be an election next Sunday, the Social Democrats would probably see their share of the vote plummet well below that of the Christian Democrats, and their coalition partners, the Greens, might be consigned to electoral oblivion. But the next federal election is not due until the autumn of 2002. Mr Schroder clearly cannot afford to be complacent but nor, as yet, should he allow himself to become unduly depressed. When his predecessor, Mr Kohl, first became chancellor, he slipped on so many banana skins that critics doubted he could last his full term. He went on to become Germany's longest-serving chancellor since Bismarck. 
Barbara Beck: surveys editor, The Economist.  1999 The biggest single happening in 2000 will be the World Exposition that opens in Hanover Germany, on June 1st. Some 40m people will visit it before it shuts at the end of October, over 250,000 a day. The World Exposition movement-now shortened to Expo-was started in London in 1851. Then it was held in the Crystal Palace which was erected by Prince Albert, Queen Victoria's German husband, in Hyde Park. When it came to Paris, the Eiffel Tower was built. In Hanover there will be nothing so spectacular, except the statistics: Expo 2000 will generate $1.7 billion; 191 countries will display their wares, mostly in their own pavilions. This will be the first major international event held in Germany since unification. You can be sure that will be worth the visit: a better bet than London's Dome.  1999 Many people have come to see the Netherlands as a model country. It is the most successful of the core Eu countries. Its economy, which combines market liberalisation with social fairness, remained buoyant when several of its Eu partners struggled in the face of the world's economic troubles. But for how much longer can this social and economic ""bed of roses"", to use a popular Dutch expression, stay in full bloom? 
Paradoxically, flourishing economic conditions seem to present the greatest danger. The Netherlands owes much of its success to its tradition of effective negotiation and consensus between the government, the employer federations and the trade unions. This has produced some excellent policies in recent years, such as restraints on public spending, reforms of the labour market and the social-security system, and wage moderation. But these measures were taken in less rosy economic times. Now the 15-year-old consensus is eroding. 
In boom times corporate profits have risen strongly and trade unions are increasingly unwilling to accept wage restraint for the sake of the international competitiveness of Dutch firms, when executives are rewarding themselves with huge pay rises. Unbridled consumer spending and spiralling house prices have cast further doubts on the sustainability of the Dutch model. 
A period of economic belttightening may be just what is needed. Employment growth, which has been a source of envy for the country's Eu partners, will come to a halt in 2000, weakening consumer confidence and dampening the economy. Meanwhile, spirits could be raised if, as many expect, the Dutch national team wins the European soccer championship, which it is co-hosting with Belgium. The Orange feel-good factor tends to work wonders for Dutch morale and community spirit.  1999 Although they live in a divided country, Belgians have a talent for showing solidarity in times of crisis. When faced with an emergency (not a rare occurrence: a string of scandals has entangled the country in recent years) feuds between the Dutchspeaking Flemish and French-speaking Walloon communities are put on hold and people unite. When an outrage involving an outbreak of food contamination through the mixing of dioxin with animal feed erupted in May 1999, Belgians of all kinds responded by being uncharacteristically decisive. They showed their discontent through the ballot box by throwing out the government and putting an end to 40 years of political domination by the Christian Democrats. 
The question now will be: can the new government, an untried combination of Liberals, Socialists and Greens, pull the country out of its doldrums? It is helped by the fact that the previous government did bring public finances under control. After the setback from the food scare, Belgium is back on track to benefit from a general au-wide and global economic recovery. cnr growth will accelerate to a respectable 2.6%. Inflation will pick up slightly but remain safely below the price stability target set by the European Central Bank. 
But the danger is that, once the initial enthusiasm for change has faded along with the latest scandal, the country's underlying divisions will resurface. The new coalition could split not only as a result of the reemergence of linguistic divisions but also over important policy issues such as privatisation, working time, taxation or social benefits. Above all it will want to avoid another major setback and to improve the international image of Belgium in a year when Brussels will be a European city of culture and Ghent will celebrate the 500th anniversary of Charles V's birth.  1999 Several million pilgrims will pour into Rome during the course of 2000 for the Jubilee of the Catholic Church. Catholic parishes around the world are independently preparing their own groups of pilgrims to St Peter's, making the numbers that will come difficult to predict. No other city, except perhaps London, is taking the millennium so seriously, with many museums being renovated and events planned by no means only at the Vatican. Rome's ability to cope with the crowds will be tested well beyond its limit. So, if you have no religious motives to visit Italy's capital, wait for 2001. 
Waiting may prove difficult, though, for Massimo D'Alema, whose centre-left government does not have to face a general election until 2001. His parliamentary majority is a rowdy bunch which includes Catholic militants and greens, free-marketeers and hard-line communists, former socialists and disgruntled faithfuls of Romano Prodi, the current president of the European Commission, who consider Mr D'Alema responsible for Mr Prodi's abrupt dismissal from Palazzo Chigi (the prime minister's residence) in 1998. This is not new, of course, in a country that has had 56 governments since the second world war. 
Yet Italians are growing impatient with short-lived administrations; they want stability. If the current centre-left majority dissolves because of internal squabbles-and it might-the centreright, led by tycoon-cum-politician Silvio Berlusconi, will easily win the next election, despite its leader's legal tangles (three convictions, appeals pending, more trials coming up). 
Youth unemployment and crime will be the most heated political topics. A short-sighted immigration policy and an uncomfortable geographical position-- the Balkans are just a few miles across the Adriatic-have allowed many illegal immigrants to sneak into the country. Unlike the law-abiding million-odd immigrants, many of these clandestine have set up criminal rings that compete or cooperate with the local mob. 
The economy will grow rather slowly but will become more competitive and transparent. Within the European Monetary Union, export-oriented Italy does not have the advantage of a weak currency; and Mario Monti, the commissioner for competition in Brussels, watches severely over his own country. Some will moan as more of Italy's top brands are snapped up by foreign companies. As outgoing investments are five times higher than incoming ones, nobody should care. The complaints of foreign investors will help to cut down the forest of red tape, still the primary problem for Italy's economy. A guess: Fiat, Italy's largest private group, will find the global partner it is looking for. 
Reform in Italy cannot be delayed, despite years of successful resistance. The list of things needing attention is almost universally agreed: 
Justice. The average time between indictment and a court judgment is ten years; eight out of ten convictions that involve prison terms never take effect. 
Defence. The armed forces are outdated, apart from a few elite corps. 
Transport. There are too many strikes in the public-transport system; the motorway system has become obsolete. 
The health service. Hospitals in big cities are run down; there are too many doctors everywhere. 
Welfare. Pensions eat up too much of Italy's public finances and will bankrupt the government unless there are further reductions. 
Each of these will provide plenty of scandals and general unhappiness in 2000. But ferocious lobbying will prevent much from happening. A small piece of legislation, a magistrate, a political party, a street rally: weapons are not hard to find in Italy if you want to stop something from happening. 
The improvements needed in Italy's civic society are also universally acknowledged; and they will also be slow in coming. Too many Italians will avoid paying taxes in 2000. According to one estimate, 30% of all incomes are hidden from the taxman, and up to 50% in the south of the country. Too few will wear seat belts. On average, according to Automobil Club Italiano, only 20% do, compared with 80% in the rest of the Eu. Stopping at zebra crossings will still be considered bizarre behaviour. 
Nonetheless, a generation of professional people, which travelled and studied abroad in the 1980s, is coming of age, and will leave its mark. English will be more widely spoken. And although several north European countries fear creeping ""Italianisation"", Italy will pick up some northern habits. Some good (a less emotional attitude; more attention to the environment; a desire for more stable government). Some less so (more television-watching, more heavy drinking and violence among young people). 
An easy prediction: il calcio (football) will dominate 2000. The amount of money spent by the teams, the television time and newspaper space devoted to the sport will be staggering-even those Vatican pilgrims will notice that Italy has at least another, more mundane, faith. 
Beppe Severgnini: columnist for Corriere della Sera and Italy correspondent for The Economist. His latest book is ""Italiani si diventa"" (Rizzoli).  1999 Adjourn nowadays to one of the Dublin pubs immortalised by James Joyce for some of that famous chat and Guinness, and there is a fair chance that your barperson will be from Brisbane or Barcelona, unskilled in the great art of pulling a good pint of the black stuff. Ireland's prolonged boom is bringing the world to its doorstep. 
The republic is about to enter the sixth year of a cycle in which Irish economic growth rates have outstripped all Eu and oECD states. In 1999 the economy grew by 6-7%, compared with a eurozone average of 2% and an oECD average of about 2.4%. In 2000, Irish growth will probably be around 6%, with unemployment between 4% and 5%, and a surplus of perhaps IRL2 billion ($1.4 billion) for the exchequer. 
The visitor will hear of Monte Carlo-scale prices for houses in the south Dublin suburbs and sonorous tales of delivery delays for new luxury cars. Friday's Irish Times will come weighted with pages of,job offers for computer engineers, investment analysts and financial-services specialists. And, invariably, the visitor will hear the question posed, ""How long will it last?"" 
The answer in terms of living standards is probably indefinitely, although future growth is not going to be maintained at near double-digit figures and the staggering rise in house prices will tail off. The industries that sustain the Irish economic wonder-computers, electronics, pharmaceuticals and financial services-are well-embedded. Membership of the euro will ensure tight fiscal controls, low interest rates and modest inflation. The biggest threat may be the shortage of skilled employees. Ireland's wealth per head may have edged ahead of the United Kingdom but it still lags behind that of France, Germany, the Benelux and the Scandinavian countries. There should be nothing too remarkable about a small state of 3.5m people, by and large well-educated, achieving mainstream European levels of earnings more than a quarter-century after joining the EEC. But there are more searching questions to be asked. 
Dublin is not Ireland. And the elegant villas of Killiney and Howth are not Dublin. Serious problems of regional imbalance remain, with the midlands and the Atlantic seaboard counties trailing well behind the capital and the eastern towns. There are evident problems. The rail system is poor and unreliable. Modern motorways peter off into two-lane country roads. Dublin's daily traffic tangles are the stuff of urban legend. Under pressure from increasingly impatient business and industry sectors, the Fianna Fail-led government of Bertie Ahern will start a IR33 billion programme of infrastructural investment in 2000 to stretch over seven years. 
The republic's middle classes are doing better but the poor, according to the latest OECD figures, are faring proportionately less well. Almost half a million investors made paper profits-at least in the short term-out of the privatisation of the national telecom company in 1999 and something similar is likely to happen, probably towards the end of 2000, with the flotation of Aer Lingus, the state airline. Notwithstanding the emergence of this new shareowning class and the huge increase in jobs, a core of almost 100,000 long-term unemployed will remain in 2000. In certain bleak suburban wastelands the recurring cycle of poor education, crime, drugs and poverty has yet to be broken. 
The priority for the government in 2000 will be to renew the successful national pay partnerships which have set the framework for economic growth. The unions will probably agree if the government can find ways in which to reduce, rather than exacerbate, social and economic inequity and to even out the growing imbalances in regional development. Efforts to date have not been notably successful. Runaway house prices and speculative investment will see many young couples-even those with good jobs-still unable to buy a home in Dublin. 
Mr Ahern's government depends on the support of the Progressive Democrats and a number of independents in the Dail. Two judicial tribunals, sitting at Dublin Castle to investigate (among other things) the allegations of corruption against a former prime minister, Charles Haughey, will be reporting within the next year. So too will be a special committee of the Dail, investigating the role of the banks and the revenue authorities in tax-evasion. The political and business establishments, many of whose leading lights have been in and out of the witness box, await the tribunals' reports with trepidation. So far, Mr Ahern has remained largely untouched by the tide of sleaze but if this were to change it is certain that his coalition partners would insist on a switch of leadership. In that event, watch for the rise of Charles McCreevey, the finance minister, or the clean-cut, not-yet-40, education minister, Micheal Martin. 
There is also something new in the Irish air. The country's once-undiluted enthusiasm for Europe is on the wane. Ireland will shortly become a net contributor to the Eu coffers, bringing the gravy train, which has undoubtedly contributed greatly to the recent years of prosperity, to a halt. Simultaneously, the government's decision to make a military commitment to NATO's Partnership for Peace initiative will provide a focus to the debate over the increase in these international links, and their threat to Ireland's longstanding and sacrosanct tradition of neutrality. 
The slow, painstaking search for a settlement in Northern Ireland will continue. Few expect a breakdown in the form of a return to full-scale violence. The IRA's political wing, Sinn Fein, has discovered that not all power grows from the barrel of a gun-and will be busy during the year, seeking to build its future electoral base, north and south. A working settlement in Northern Ireland would greatly enhance Mr Ahern's political prestige. As ever, in 2000, the Irish both north and south will recognise that they are obliged to share life on a very small island. With peace confirmed in one part and prosperity in the other, 2000 will be a year of promise. 
Conor Brady: editor, Irish Times.  1999 Outside observers tend to imagine that the Nordic countries share common ""Nordic values"" and have the same attitudes towards most issues. But neighbourliness does not mean uniformity. Take the crucial issue of Economic and Monetary Union (EMU), which reveals striking differences between the countries. 
Sweden and Denmark, which have so far opted out of the single currency, will grapple with the issue of joining. Goran Persson, the pro-EMU Swedish prime minister, faces powerful opposition to participation from within and outside his party, making a Swedish move towards membership unlikely. Mr Persson will hope that a party congress in early 2000 will at least lead his party to back his policy wholeheartedly. So much euroscepticism in Sweden makes Denmark, which nearly derailed the Maastricht treaty with its infamous ""no"" vote in 1992, look positively pro-European. Its prime minister, Poul Nyrup Rasmussen, can expect a majority in favour of EMU membership in a referendum, which could be held in late 2000. 
Finland, by far the most proEuropean Nordic country, was a founder-member of EMU. Finns can therefore worry about other issues, such as electing a new president in early 2000. Elisabeth Rehn looks set to become the first female Finnish president. By contrast, Norway is not even an Eu member (and with oil revenue recovering nicely in 2000 after the 1998 price collapse, Norwegians will be in no hurry to change their minds on Eu membership). That rules out the EMU possibility altogether. 
Whatever the stance on EMU, and despite varying growth prospects (1.8% in Denmark, 4.5% in Iceland), there will be one common Nordic theme in 2000: budgetary virtue. Iceland's budget will be close to balance. And the other four will be able to report a surplus on the general government balance.  1999 An uncanny silence, punctuated by the occasional roar, will fall over Europe for two hours in the early evening of Sunday July 2nd. The continent's lOOm football fans will be glued to their television sets watching the final of the European Championship being fought out in Rotterdam. 
This championship, second only to football's once-every-four-years World Cup, is being hosted by two nations: the Netherlands and Belgium. Ironically, these neighbouring countries have a particular enmity towards each other on the football field; recent matches between them have seen players on both sides sent off, as well as an onpitch brawl. 
For stylish play look to Italy, which boasts the world's costliest player, the 90 billion lire ($50m) Christian Vieri. France, which in a typically centralised French way has a well-financed and well-subsidised development programme for young players, will do well. Not well enough though to beat the Dutch, whose big-name players such as Edgar Davids (Juventus), Japp Stam (Manchester United) and Patrick Kluivert (Barcelona) play in foreign leagues. They have the look of favourites.  1999 The year 2000 will mark the 25th anniversary of the death of General Franco, the autocrat who governed the country for nearly four decades, after scoring a cruel and bloody victory in the Spanish civil war (1936-39). A quarter of a century after the death of the man who dubbed himself ""Caudillo"" (""Fuhrer""), the Spain governed by the children and grandchildren of the civil war bears few signs of the Franco legacy. More than 20 years of parliamentary democracy and a growing openness to the rest of the world have changed the face of Spain. 
Spain in 2000 will be curiously certain as to the role it wants to play: there will be none of the European doubts that there are in Britain> none of the tentativeness about foreign policy still to be found in Germany. Since June 1985, when Felipe Gonzalez, the socialist prime minister, signed the Spanish accession to the Eu, through to its current participation in monetary union, as ratified by the right-wing Jose Maria Aznar, each government has followed the same policy. All political parties have worked for a nation with a capitalist economy, firmly integrated into the institutions of the western world, and all want Spain to be an enthusiastic partner with Europe and with Latin America. The few remaining doubts about the inevitability of these policies have been raised, paradoxically, by more conservative thinkers, the heirs to Franco's power, rather than by Social Democrats. Indeed, the current ruling right-wing party abstained in Mr Gonzalez's referendum on entry into NaTO. Only a few months before coming into power, Mr Aznar had no qualms about declaring his opposition to the euro. Yet today he has emerged as one of its greatest supporters. 
Spaniards seem to feel that international alliances are the best antidote to the devils at home. Spain is anxious to anchor itself in other people's liberalism, lest the ghosts of 25 years ago return. The 20th century started badly for Spain with the loss of the remnants of its colonial empire and its defeat at the hands of the United States. A dogged introspection came into vogue, and Spain distanced itself from Europe. This exaggerated gloom of the past is the intellectual precursor of the equally exaggerated exuberance and internationalism of 2000. 
The enthusiasm shown by some Spanish business executives for globalisation has at times reached ridiculous extremes, with near neo-imperialist overtones. Spain, for example, has become one of the major international investors in Latin America. This has led to considerable resentment from the ruling classes in the so-called sister republics. They welcome the investment, but resent the arrogance of companies such as Telefonica and Endesa. Spain might be their mother country but mother is often best kept 3,000 miles away. 
Spaniards have exploited the unquestionable power of Castilian as the unifying language of more than 20 countries. The cultural unity of Latin America rests largely in the power of Spanish as a common language, in which there are none of the differences or divergences which, for example, separate American from British English. The growth of the Spanish-speaking population north of the Rio Grande gives rise to the hope that Spanish business people and intellectuals may now have an opportunity to flourish in the United States. A number of Spanish media companies are firmly ensconced on the other side of the Atlantic. Seeing this move, many companies from the Eu are now coming to Spain in order to gain a foothold there before leaping across the Atlantic to Latin America. Publishers provide a good example: Bertelsmann, Pearson, Havas and Hachette have all invested in Spain with an eye to the new world. 
The new Spain's global spirit has strange facets. While, for instance, it is considered a sign of modernity to admit to being a Basque, Catalan or Galician nationalist, the old Spanish nationalism hardly dares lift its head at home. It only shows its face, with the arrogance of old, in the American subcontinent. 
Juan Luis Cehrian: founder and publisher of El Pais  1999 After the natural disaster of 1999, a man-made recovery in 2000? Turkey will begin to get its inflationridden economy in order, helped by its first formal iMF agreement since the previous one collapsed in 1995. It cannot afford to do otherwise. 
The 1999 fiscal deficit ballooned into double digits as the economy went into recession and spending ran ahead of plan-first because of government largesse before early parliamentary elections, then as reconstruction got under way in the aftermath of the devastating August earthquake. Spending will have to be checked, but not at the expense of rebuilding the 60,000 homes that were destroyed or damaged in the earthquake. 
Only with speedy reconstruction can the government hope to take the edge off public anger over the authorities' ineptitude revealed by the earthquake. If this does not appear to be working, the government will not hesitate to resort to old-fashioned censorship. With many journalists, politicians and intellectuals already behind bars for no more than voicing their differences with the state, Turks are likely to get on with rebuilding their lives and leave politics to the same tired leaders who have been running the country for years. 
The justice system will come under further scrutiny as Abdullah Ocalan, the head of the Kurdish guerrilla movement, the Kurdistan Workers' Party, faces execution following his June 1999 conviction in a Turkish court. Before the death sentence can be carried out, parliament must approve it. The Turks have not executed anyone for 15 years. Mr Ocalan is, therefore, more likely to rot in jail. Not least, this would help Turkey's relations with the Eu to improve over the coming year. Formal accession talks will not start until human-rights problems are solved. Greece's long-time animosity will fade, but will not disappear altogether.  1999 In 2000, the countries that once loyally orbited the Soviet Union will have much to celebrate. A decade on from communism's demise across Central and Eastern Europe, they have firmly locked on to a new orbit around Brussels. Although hardly paragons of democracy and transparency, they have steered clear of the virulent crony capitalism that has infected Russia and most other former Soviet states. And, for the most part, their economies have proved resilient enough to pull through the Russian crisis and the war in Kosovo relatively unscathed. 
There is still far to go. Even among the frontrunners, such as Poland, Slovenia and Hungary, economic reforms are half finished at best and it is the most socially sensitive of these that have been postponed. Meanwhile, hopes for early entry to the Eu will be dashed again in 2000 despite renewed efforts to speed up the process. As a result, anti-western voices will grow louder. 
The economic picture is mixed, but generally positive. The Czech Republic, the region's fallen star, will start to grow again after two years of painful recession. Now that some of the past governments' sillier plans have been overhauled-including a botched privatisation programme that left insiders, or worse, no one, in control of companies-the economy should emerge more competitive and less prone to currency crashes than before. Still, it will be years before the Czechs can again claim star status in the eastern part of the continent. Overdue corporate restructuring may yet push unemployment over 10%. 
Poland will once again put in an impressive performance. After years of tigerish growth, the economy slowed in 1999, weighed down by the emergingmarkets' crisis. The pick-up it will experience in 2000, registering growth of 5%, will be a testament to its success in moving its trade towards the eurozone, where growth is once again reviving; one-third of Poland's exports now go to Germany alone. 
There is no call for smugness, however. Not even Poland is close to hitting the sort of growth rates that might bring living standards up to European Union levels within another 20 years. Moreover, 2000 will be the year that those countries at the front of the pack have to start grappling in earnest with the second stage of post-communist reform. 
Selling thousands of stateowned companies, cleaning up financial regulation and bringing inflation down to single digits are no mean feats, to be sure. However, the next stage will be even tougher. The region is still full of very big companies in heavy industries that make no profit but absorb plenty of public money. Now that political heads are finally emerging from the sand, the task will be to restructure these, at great cost to jobs, leaving smaller but more competitive industries in their wake. The list stretches from mining (a particular worry in Poland and Romania) to steel and defence. Such restructuring will strain some national budgets to breaking point: for all its economic dynamism, Poland cannot rule out a currency wobble in 2000. 
As governments tackle the most sodaily sensitive areas of economic reform, and jobs disappear in their thousands, public resentment will grow. This will manifest itself in increased scepticism towards integration with western clubs that are seen as driving those reforms, in particular the Eu. For ministers in Prague, Warsaw and Budapest, Eu membership remains the main foreign-policy objective. However, ordinary Central and East Europeans increasingly see the Eu as a protectionist clique that wants to prise open its applicants' markets but is prepared to concede little in return. 
Their distrust of Brussels will spread in 2000, as opponents of membership or those who want it delayed persuade voters that quick accession amounts to economic prostitution. Unease will also grow as it becomes clear that accession talks will get thornier as they advance. Although much ground has been covered, the rockiest areas-in particular agriculture-are yet to be properly discussed. The talks may not founder on farm trade, but they are certain to get heavily bogged down: one reason, perhaps, why the Eu remains reluctant to set firm admission dates for any of the six leading applicants (five from Eastern Europe, plus Cyprus). 
Economic nationalism will grow loudest in Poland. Support among Poles for joining the Eu is dwindling fast, down from 80% in 1996 to 55%. During 2000 that figure will keep falling, to below 50%, as parties that oppose Eu membership, such as the Christian Nationalists in the ruling coalition, strike a chord with the growing number of voters who worry that their country is rushing into a bad deal. The debate over whether Poland has let in too much foreign capital sparked by the sale of most big banks to foreigners, will also intensify. Foreign supermarket chains will come under fire for undermining small local shops. Politicians may be forced to listen. 
Anti-EU sentiment will not be limited to Poland. In Hungary too, there is strong opposition to selling land to foreigners, largely based on fears of German money flooding the market. In the Czech Republic, a kind of cultural nationalism is taking root as intellectuals increasingly criticise the ""mindless"" western films and television programmes that now dominate. Nor is the frustration directed solely at Brussels: in 2000, Eastern Europe's main stockmarkets will lose much of their best business to Frankfurt. 
Some good may come of this. In the mid-1990s, governments in Central and Eastern Europe were able to push through painful economic reforms by blaming them on the iMF. (""Not our fault. Either we do this or we don't get the money,"" and so on.) With the Eu becoming something of a bogeyman in Eastern Europe, the same governments might now be able to use it as a scapegoat for the latest bout of reforms. Take that too far, however, and the reward is entry to a club that your electorate is loth to join. 
Matthew Valencia: Eastern Europe correspondent, The Economist.  1999 Russia will look different next year, but not where it matters. By the end of 2000 Russia will have a new president, a new government, a new parliament and a new image. Its problems, however, will be much the same as before. (This will not bother the stockmarket-at least at first. Expect Russian asset prices to surge in the second half of the year, as outside investors start convincing themselves that the new political leadership makes this vast and cheap emerging market irresistible value.) 
It is true that Russia will sound and feel more consistently governed. The new lower house of parliament, elected (war and bombs permitting) on December 19th 1999, will prove less cantankerous and silly than the one elected four years ago. It will almost certainly get on better with the country's new president, due to be elected on July 3rd. That will avoid some of the crassest squabbles and confrontations of recent years. It will make it easier, for example, to adopt a more rational tax code (the current one offers a bleak choice between insolvency, if followed, and bribes to the tax inspector, if not). Other laws on, say, corporate governance, bankruptcy, or even private ownership of land could all go through. 
There will be other bits of good news. Foreign creditor countries, always willing to give Russia one last chance, will probably negotiate new terms (even a write-off) of the $42 billion state-to-state debt inherited from the Soviet Union. Coupled with a continued high oil price, and perhaps even a new Eurobond issue, that could make Russia's finances look misleadingly rosy. Foreign direct investors, in industries ranging from consumer goods to forestry, will reckon that Russia's 140m population and wealth of raw materials are worth a punt-especially if their investments are underwritten by western governments. 
But the boomlet will be deceptive. Although international goodwill, solvency and sensible laws may be necessary conditions for Russia to prosper, they are certainly not sufficient ones. The biggest problem, of ingrained lawlessness, is the result of centuries of bad government (first feudal, then communist) and will take a generation or more to change. 
This will continue to hit Russia at three levels. First, an alarming overlap between corrupt officials, gangsters and industrialists will remain the central feature of political and economic life. The growth-killing idea that a guaranteed big slice of a small pie is much better than a possible small slice of a much larger one is deeply rooted-and in Russia's dismal condition quite reasonably so. Russia's market will remain oligopolistic-meaning that there is competition of a sort, but only among the limited number of companies willing to bribe their way in. 
Second, Russian banking will remain stunted, unable to channel the country's savings into its industry. A legal system in which a bank can reliably collect the collateral on a bad loan, regardless of the debtor's location or political clout, is still many years away. Timid, underpaid judges inevitably favour powerful local interests. While that continues no sane bank is going to lend much long term. 
Third, everyday life in Russia will remain miserably backward and inefficient. You want a passport? Then go and queue for a couple of days (or slip someone a bribe). You want a driving licence? The same. Or to register your car, pass an exam, avoid military service, start a business? The same. In both the public and private sectors, promises and deadlines are for the most part unenforceable. Every minor inefficiency is somebody's livelihood. In happier coun tries, the public complains by writing to lawmakers or the newspapers-or there may even be an ombudsman, free legal advice or easily accessible courts. Not much sign of that starting in Russia. 
It was these problems that wrecked Russia's economy in 1998. This time the cycle of illusion and disillusion will be shorter. The new authorities will certainly proclaim that a new law-abiding era has begun. There will probably be some show-trials for those figures from the past who have failed to make the necessary arrangements (emigration or switching sides being the two most obvious). But soon enough-by 2001 at the latest-it will be clear that the changes are superficial, and that Russia remains, at heart, as morally and financially bankrupt as before. Investors, remembering how badly they were caught out in 1998, will stampede for the exit. 
Does it matter? Yes. Another crash will underline Russia's isolation from the rest of the world and highlight the gulf opening up, seemingly inexorably, between the eastern and western halves of the post-communist world. 
Edward Lucas: Russia correspondent, 
The Economist.  1999 Like Russia's economy, foreign policy will be deceptive. Under a new president, whether it is the portly Yevgeny Primakov or the steely Vladimir Putin (the latter was President Boris Yeltsin's favourite in late 1999), or some other candidate, the style will be more vigorous and assertive. Alcohol, illness and old age made every public appearance by Mr Yeltsin risky, and sometimes outright humiliating. 
President X will have foreign policy ideas of his own, and will take to the world stage to promote them. This will be something of a shock for western policymakers, used to Russia's role in recent years as a grumpy, unreliable but largely untroublesome force in world affairs. Where Russia still has a few cards to play-with nuclear weapons, or against its even weaker neighboursexpect tough bargaining. The biggest tussle will be over the future of the former captive nations, especially in Central Asia and the Caucasus, and possibly the Baltic states. 
Bad news? Not really. Although some alarmists will talk of a new cold war whenever a row flares up, Russia is so weak that it can advance its interests only if the West loses its nerve. Money matters most to Russia's rulers. Sound and fury are all very well (and so is friendship, although there are few takers on the western side for that now) but making sure that the country stays integrated into the world economy, so as to sell oil, gas, gold and diamonds, to borrow and launder money, and to pay for imports of consumer goods, is most important of all. 
Look beyond the central authorities' stroppiness, and another trend-the decentralisation of foreign policy-will become more visible in 2000. GovernorsRussia's powerful regional barons-are often unsavoury or incompetent (or both). But the brighter ones have already begun to realise the benefits of foreign investment. 
The scores of regional commercial representatives already based abroad will grow in importance. If you want to deal with the men who matter in a country, you end up talking to their representatives. The regions have no nuclear weapons, but on most other questions, the governors' words will count for more, and the central government's for a lot less.  1999 Decommissioning of Ulster's terrorist weapons should be completed by May. Completed? The question is whether the IRA will have started. 
Tony Blair in 2000 will preside over the final destruction of the traditional British constitution. Neither he nor anyone else knows what will emerge in its place. 
The old constitution was highly centralised. In contrast to most democratic countries, there were no autonomous centres of political power. The prime minister and cabinet controlled the legislature. The absence of a written constitution and a bill of rights meant that the courts lacked the power to strike down acts of parliament. Local government was a creature of central government. There was no regional or provincial tier of government at all. 
Centralisation on this scale exhibited all the usual vices: delay, rigidity, excessive uniformity and a tendency towards ""the universalisation of error"", but it had one virtue. Centralisation of power meant centralisation of responsibility. The buck stopped at Westminster. When things went wrong, the British people knew who to blame. If they wanted to throw the rascals out, they knew precisely who the rascals were-as John Major discovered the hard way in 1997. 
No longer. National governments will still come and go, but they now have rivals. The last year of the old millennium saw the setting up of a largely autonomous Scottish parliament and a less autonomous-but still potentially pesky-Welsh assembly. The first year of the new millennium will see the process taken further. 
In early May, London-which has not had a metropolis-wide political authority since Margaret Thatcher abolished the Greater London Council in 1986-will elect for the first time its own executive mayor as well as a representative city council. The new authority's powers are limited; education, for example, will remain in the hands of the capital's 32 boroughs. But from May 2000 onwards London, like Paris, Berlin and Brussels, will have a highly visible presence in national politics. 
The practice of electing executive mayors, new to Britain, will begin to take hold in 2000 as big cities start to hold referendums to decide whether to adopt a mayoral system. Several will conclude that they should elect prominent local boys and girls whom non-locals, especially in Whitehall, will take seriously. The effect will be the rise of a new class of subnational politicians with large budgets and, more important, ample street cred. Britain will soon have its own Brandts, Chiracs, Daleys and Giulianis. 
The missing tier of regional government is already being partially filled in by Scotland and Wales. In 2000 the English regions will move, cautiously at first, in the same direction. All the regions now have development agencies and indirectly elected regional chambers or assemblies, representing local authorities, business and the trade unions. Some of them will be content for now to remain talking shops, but at least three-those in the north-east, north-west and southwest-will press for direct elections and substantial powers. 
At Westminster, the House of Commons, never one of the world's more powerful legislatures, will continue to dwindle in importance. Prime minister's question time-always more highly regarded by viewers of America's C-Span than by the folks back home-will continue to provide light entertainment on Wednesday afternoons. (Both the prime minister and the leader of the opposition, if no one else, will continue to take it seriously.) Elsewhere in the Palace of Westminster life will ebb away, with Mrs spending longer and longer weekends in their constituencies, the chamber itself mostly empty and Commons committees influential, if at all, only at the margins. 
The House of Lords, a charming but normally sleepy body, is going to provide Mr Blair and his colleagues with their one serious in-house headache. The Lords, already shorn in 1999 of most of their 600-strong hereditary element, will require in 2000 to be ""reformed"". The government is committed to reform and by January 2000 will have received a royal commission report detailing proposals for change. How the government deals with the commission's report will constitute a major test of its modernising credentials. 
But the biggest single constitutional change of 2000 will occur on Monday October 2nd. On that day, the Human Rights Act, effectively incorporating the European Convention on Human Rights into Britain's domestic law, will come into force. The immediate effect will be to enable British citizens who believe their rights have been violated to litigate in the United Kingdom instead of Strasbourg; but the more significant longterm effect will be to tilt the balance of power in the British system towards the courts. Much litigation under the new act will be aimed directly at the government itself. Moreover, although the courts will not, strictly speaking, be able to strike down acts of parliament, they will have the power to embarrass ministers by pointing to discrepancies between the new act and all existing and future legislation. 
Mr Blair thus sees power slipping away from Whitehall to Scotland, Wales, the courts and the various new regional and local institutions. The House of Lords in its new guise-whatever that turns out to be-is bound to become more assertive. The Eu already acts as an effective check on British ministers. 
Unsurprisingly under the circumstances, Mr Blair will use 2000 to consolidate his hold on what remains-quite a lot-of British central power. Ministers will have to take even more notice than they already do of the views of the Cabinet Office and the Downing Street policy unit, which, taken together, already constitute a prime minister's department in all but name. 
The British constitution used to look like an elegant pyramid, with power supported at the base but exercised at the top. By the end of 2000 it will look more like an unfinished building designed by a slightly dotty architect. 
Anthony King: professor of government at Essex University: election commentator for the eec and regular contributor to the Daily Telegraph.  1999 The British economy is looking more invincible with each month that goes by. Britain used to stagger like a drunken sailor from crisis to crisis, but now it has by far the strongest public finances in Europe. Its monetary arrangements are singled out by the tMF as a model for other European countries. The financial markets apparently share the IMF's confidence in Britain's macroeconomic stability. Sterling has been the world's second strongest currency since 1995 and 30-year interest rates are now lower in Britain than they are in Germany or the United States. 
At first sight this all seems too good to be true. Most people in Britain are natural sceptics. As they survey the state of the British economy, the natural inclination is to wonder whether things can really be as good as they seem. After all, Britain has an unemployment rate second only to America's among the G7 countries. Inflation has been within 0.5% of the government's chosen target throughout the past two years. There ic a cast-iron fiscal position and a universally admired monetary framework. 
All this means that the British economy will continue to do well in the next few years. What is more doubtful is whether it will continue to outperform almost all other oEcD countries as impressively as it has done since 1994. For Britain is now entering the phase of the economic cycle in which performance depends less on the skilful management of monetary and fiscal policy than on the economy's underlying structural strengths. And contrary to widespread belief, it is in macroeconomic management that the British economy has lately been particularly successful, whereas Britain's underlying competitive structure still leaves a lot to be desired. 
Let us begin with the good news. Britain has done extremely well since 1993 by the standard criteria of economic analysis. And, just as it was possible to predict that Britain would cope in 1998 and 1999 with the challenges of the strong pound and the emerging markets' crisis, it can now be said with reasonable confidence that Britain will remain one of the healthiest economies in the world in 2000 and beyond. 
The economy will grow by at least 3% in 2000, pushing it even further up the league of industrialised nations to a position very close to that of France. Interest rates will doubtless rise in the year ahead-perhaps to a level somewhat higher than the 7% currently discounted in financial markets. Inflation will remain very subdued because of a structural upsurge of price competition in many British markets which have been cartelised for decades. 
In the second half of 2000 the pound may retreat a bit against the euro as a result of the widening deficit in the balance of payments and the accelerating recovery in Europe. But any such move should be modest, since the deficit itself is likely to stabilise at around 2% of cDr and then shrink gradually as domestic demand in Europe expands. Moreover, the pound's retreat will probably come after a period of even greater strength. In fact, before the upswing that began in 1996 is over, the pound should test its 1988 high point of DM3.25, equivalent to =L0.60. 
Sitting pretty on a fence 
The strength of the pound, along with the public's ambivalence towards Europe, will ensure that Tony Blair will continue to sit on the fence with regard to European Monetary Union (EMU) as he prepares for the next general election in early 2001. Thus a decision on abolishing the pound and joining the single currency is unlikely to be made in the period immediately after the 2001 election. More probably, the whole question of EMU membership will be put off again until Mr Blair's third parliamentary term, from around 2005 to 2009. Given the time required for a referendum and then to make practical monetary arrangements, Britain seems very unlikely to join the single currency for at least another seven years. For practical purposes, therefore, EMU should probably be ignored as an operative factor. Interestrate decisions in Europe will not have much influence on monetary policies in Britain. Speculation about an entry rate for the pound in ENtu will have less and less impact on currency investors. And prudent businesses should make their decisions on investment and trade with Britain on the assumption that the pound will continue to float. 
This freedom from arbitrary constraints on economic policy should be helpful to Britain. Since there is no reason to believe that the Bank of England and the Treasury will suddenly lose the skills in demand management which they have developed since the mid1990s, Britain should outperform its more constrained European neighbours-especially Germany-when it comes to keeping both unemployment and inflation under good control. 
Having said all this, however, there must now be some serious questions about how long Britain can keep its economic lead, especially as other European countries learn from Britain's successes and start to adopt more active monetary and fiscal policies to manage demand. Once this begins to happen the great irony of the British economic miracle may start to be understood. Britain's economic success is usually attributed to its flexible labour markets, its competitive markets, its strong entrepreneurship and its dynamic, liberal financial sector. But this image of humming efficiency in the supply-side engine room of the British economy does not accord with the country's relatively poor statistics on productivity growth. The truth is that the transformation of Britain's economic performance has so far been due mainly to skilful demand management. The widely discussed improvements in Britain's supply side have been less apparent. 
Productivity growth has hardly accelerated in Britain since the mid-1980s and has continued to lag far behind the rates achieved in Germany and France. That this is not just a statistical illusion is suggested by anecdotal comparisons of market structures and corporate performance in Britain and other countries. Far from being a free-market entrepreneurial paradise, Britain actually seems to suffer from more cartelised markets with much higher prices than the rest of Europe. It has fewer small businesses than other European countries; and the City of London, even though it remains the world's leading centre for international finance, is notably weak in supporting financial innovation within Britain. British-owned companies, in sectors ranging from engineering, chemicals and computer services to retailing, entertainment, banking and insurance, have generally proved weak competitors in global markets. More and more have succumbed to foreign takeovers. The undoubted strength of the economy in 2000 will not disguise the many weaknesses that remain. 
Anatole Kaletsky: columnist on The Times and director of Kaletsky Economic Consulting.  1999 There will be a great effusion of what passes for British warmth and emotion on August 4th 2000, when Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth the Queen Mother turns 100. Unlike the media hype that will go with it, this warmth will be genuine. The Queen Mother is Britain's ""favourite royal"". She has served her country well, most notably standing by her notoriously shy and uncertain husband, King George VI, during the second world war. More recently she has developed the image, with a bright smile and flowery hat, of being everybody's perfect grandmother, or rather, great grandmother. She will be one of about 8,800 Britons to be 100 or over; a reminder of today's longevity. Like all of them she will receive a message of congratulations from her daughter at Buckingham Palace.  1999 Rising crime, hopeless transport, declining services, agricultural crisis-why would anyone want to live in the English countryside? And yet people do: in such large numbers that house-building has become another in the litany of woes afflicting rural areas. According to government calculations, 3.8m new homes must be built in England by 2021 to keep pace with the changing pattern of domestic life. Fine. But nobody has yet solved the question of where to put them. 
On the face of it, it may seem strange that this demand should exist when the British population is more or less stable at 59m. But government demographers base their calculations on changes to the way we live. More and more young people pursue higher education, choosing, in the curious British tradition, universities that are often far away from the parental home. When they finish their studies, they do not return to the nest. Later in life, a third of them will marry and divorce, forcing one partner to set up in a new home. Even the otherwise happy fact that people are living longer has its downside: fewer properties are being released back on to the market through death. Added to these internal changes in demography is the potentially explosive issue of immigration. Official statisticians used to assume that net immigration would fall to zero. Recent figures allow for immigration to rise to an annual net level of 65,000, remaining at that figure until 2036. This alone would create the need for half a million new homes by 2016. Though ministers are loth to discuss such a sensitive matter, and it has generally escaped public attention, the newcomers put extra pressure on the stock of available housing. 
For most of the 1990s, the British domestic property market has been in the doldrums. This has allowed successive governments to put the issue of building new homes from their minds. Building companies were more likely to go bankrupt than embark on ambitious new projects. But in 1999 low interest rates set house prices in southern England fizzing. Soon, no doubt, the chancellor of the exchequer will want to put the cork back into the champagne bottle, but he will find the task even more difficult than did his predecessors if interest rates decline towards European levels. In 2000 prices will probably continue to gush higher, particularly in and around millennium-mad London. House-builders will push hard to be allowed to provide the new homes that are said to be needed, because of the big money to be made from them. The controversial Crow report supports plans to build 1.1m homes in the south-east by 2016. Ashford, Crawley, Milton Keynes and Stansted are targeted for expansion. Councils have vowed opposition. What has been done to ready the planning system for the onslaught? 
The last housing boom came in the early 1980s, when the then Tory government mistakenly believed that the free market would solve the problem. There is not, however, a free market in housing. As a mature country, England and Wales have been subject to planning restrictions since the Middle Ages. By selectively relaxing certain planning controls, the To
ries permitted a rash of low-quality developments, crammed into or around the edges of villages, left floating as detached blobs in the countryside or scrambled into the urban chaos of London's Docklands. 
Margaret Thatcher, when prime minister, had a faith in the motor car as an expression of personal freedom, which meant that many of these 1980s 
developments were inadequately served by public transport. Some ministers of the environment encouraged developers to create new settlements that would provide a large number of dwellings, but they met such public 
resistance that no significant example was actually built. In planning, Thatcherism was a disaster. 
Now, John Prescott, as Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions, is attempting to promote a new vision. Ironically, given that he is a Labour minister and Old Labour at that, many of his ideas were pioneered by the Prince of Wales, who persuaded the Duchy of Cornwall to create the model settlement of Poundbury Farm, on the edge of Dorchester. Poundbury Farm is an attempt to rediscover the pleasure of urban living, with a far higher density of people per acre than the suburban norm. Residential, commercial and public buildings are mixed together, so that nothing should be more than a stroll away. These blessings could be conferred on some of our existing towns, Mr Prescott and his team believe, if more of the derelict land that makes them disfunction could be developed. On coming into office, he boldly announced that two-thirds of the 3.8m new homes would be built on these brown sites. 
Enter Richard Rogers, newly ennobled architect of the Pompidou Centre, the Lloyd's building and other monumenu to a whizzy technological future. Made chairman of an ""Urban Task Force"", he was charged with quantifying the amount of brown land that exists and has not found enough of it. He judges that it could not accommodate more than half the required homes. Furthermore, it is often in the wrong place-plentiful in Sunderland and the other post-industrial towns of the north, scarce in popular and scenic retirement counties such as Devon. The Rogers solution is to promote a vision of urban renaissance, strikingly similar to that of the Prince of Wales's guru, Leon Krier. It may be no coincidence that Lord Rogers is partly Italian and Mr Krier comes from Luxembourg. Both want to persuade the British public to behave more like continentals, for whom vibrant city culture is more fulfiling than rural isolation. The key to it is forcing motor traffic-particularly commuter cars-out of towns. Unfortunately for the urban idealists, Tony Blair gives every sign of being unimpressed. Voters like cars. Middle England is not yet ready to exchange its invincible green suburbs for a Barcelona-style existence. The pressure for house-building exists in the traditionally Tory and Liberal heartlands of the home counties and the south-west. Labour finds the instincts of the people who live in these areas difficult to fathom. In the year ahead, however, it will hear their complaints mounting in volume and anger.  1999 Dogs and cats from Europe will finally be allowed to walk straight through immigration into Britain-passport in paw. 
Will Britons be healthier, wealthier, wiser or happier in 2000? Patterns of social and economic change are rarely obvious to the anecdotal observer from one year to the next. Yet statistics constantly remind us how much we differ from our former selves in family life, work, leisure and the issues that concern us. Rising prosperity, technological progress, the breakdown of traditional social structures and the influence of (often Americanised) media are stealthily turning many of us into new people. But they are also creating new divides, between those who are changing and those who are left behind. 
Take health, for example: awareness of the health implications of diet and exercise rose steadily through the 1990s, and will continue to grow. More hours will be spent in the gym by both men and women, and health club chains will remain a fast-expanding business sector. With concerns about the safety of beef lingering in the consumer's mind (even after most scientists have withdrawn their reservations) we will eat more chicken and less red meat; more fruit and less dairy produce. Food retailers will compete to emphasise the ""naturalness"" of their produce, and the absence of anything genetically modified. Yet obesity-an indication both of rising affluence and of dietary ignorance-will also continue to rise, afflicting more than 20% of adults: more than four women in five will admit to a wish to lose 10kg. 
Smoking will continue to decline among the middle classes, and will become almost universally unacceptable in offices, restaurants and public buildings. Political correctness will rule on this and many other matters (even extending to the suppression of the word ""British"" by the sBC in favour of ""UK diversity""). Yet incorrectness will manifest itself in just as many ways. Smoking will remain prevalent among young working-class women, who will also drink more alcohol than they used to. Influenced by ""laddish"" role models such as radio presenter Zoe Ball (whom 86% of teenage girls in a recent poll identified as the person they would most like to be, even though Ms Ball herself may be taking time off in 2000 to be a wife and mother), young women will increasingly see it as their right to behave as badly as young men. And incidences of ""road rage"" and other forms of in-your-face aggression-perpetrated by both men and women-will continue to rise. 
As for family life, there will be less than half as many first marriages in 2000 as there were a generation ago, and two marriages out of five will be remarriages. More than a quarter of adult women under 50 will be cohabiting. More than a third of all children will be born out of wedlock (four times the number of a generation ago) and in some ethnic minorities more than half; more than six births in a hundred will be to teenage mothers. Perhaps reflected in those statistics are some other measurable trends: more women will be ""economically active"" in 2000 (though many will be working only part-time) but the number of men in any form of work will be in long-term decline. People in all forms of office work will tend to work longer hours (and take shorter lunch breaks) and more people in all kinds of work will be subject to the pressures of being selfemployed, rather than collecting a company wage. 
As a result of all these factors, more than 50% of men will consider themselves, at some time in their lives, to be suffering from stress or depression. Meanwhile, more than half of the population will go through the year without any participation in religious activity. By choice or otherwise, modern Britons will have to fend for themselves with much less in the way of family, corporate or spiritual support. 
Will children suffer from this disintegration of traditional structures? The statistics do not tell us directly, but they do show that the children of 2000 will spend ten times as much time watching television as reading books, and that 15% of them will leave primary school unable to read or write. Yet school test results will almost certainly continue to improve, and 2 1/2 times as many of the youngsters of 2000 as in their parents' generation will go on to university. 
Britons will abide by at least some of their old faiths in 2000. One is football, for which it will be ever more fashionable for the professional classes to display an enthusiasm. The other is bricks and mortar: relatively low mortgage rates combined with rising earnings will fuel a property boom, and ""equity withdrawal"" will continue to fund other kinds of consumer spending-on foreign holidays, electronic gadgetry, exotic eating out and Manchester United season tickets, for example. Reflecting rising wealth, there will be more second homes-many of them in France. The success of socalled ""makeover television"", in programmes such as ""Changing Rooms"" and ""Ground Force"" will fuel a continuing obsession with home improvement. 
In summary, Britain in 2000 will be richer, fitter and more sophisticated in its technology and tastes. In many fields, women will be in the ascendant. But it will also be a lonelier, more atomistic society, in which traditional pillars of support are atrophying away. And it will be divided: the gulf of incomprehension will widen between the wired and the unwired, the made-over and the unreconstructed, the young and the old. Most significantly in political terms, a gulf will widen between rural and urban Britain. Economically disadvantaged farming and village communities, devoted to the old-fashioned pursuits of fox-hunting, church-going and family life, will see themselves as threatened and shunned by self-confident, second-home-owning, mobile-phone-equipped, politically correct townies. That division, stridently expressed, will be the clearest of all illustrations of the changing nature of the Britons of 2000. 
Martin Vander Weyer: associate editor of The Week.  1999 Chris Patten, Europe's new commissioner for external relations, reflects on the lasting strength of liberal ideas. 
The countdown to the millennium has been accompanied by list-making on an heroic scale-best of these, worst of those. Who, for example, have been the greatest thinkers of the century, or the full thousand years? Who has shaped the world, or rather who has shaped it for better, not worse? 
Most of the lists try to balance the political philosophers, economists and leaders of the left against those of the right. Ideas, apparently, have to be served up on the basis of ""on one hand, on the other"". But if we are concerned about ideas that have survived and prospered, why include Marx and his progeny of Socialist divines? 
The totalitarianism of the left, so frequently investing the mad wickedness of tyrants with a spurious intellectualism, has earned its place in the history books by the death, misery and poverty it caused. Modern scholarship has shredded what were once argued to be the modest triumphs of Leninism. 
So who from the left deserves to be garlanded on the grounds of continuing relevance? The Marxist empire whether of ideas or of military occupation-has collapsed in Europe. 
Socialism in Asia has transmuted into the robber-baron capitalism of China. Those British prophets of socialism, Tawney and the Webbs, are no longer the intellectual godparents of Africa's development economists. Where guerrillas and terrorists still breed in jungles and slums, they are more likely to be motivated by ethnic hatred, nasty populism and the ideals of the Mafia than by the ideas of the old left. 
Even the contribution of social democracy-Dick Crosland, Willy Brandt and all those who sought to civilise rather than overthrow capitalism-is today a questionable commodity. In Britain, the Labour Party's makeover signals the death of any attempt to justify a programme of public ownership and redistribution. New Labour and its Third Way (in one American critic's phrase, ""opportunism with a human face""), recognises that policies and ideas that once promoted social solidarity now help produce social alienation. The challenge in a Europe where the jobless queues stretch around the block is how to strip away the regulation and limit the state intervention that have helped to gum up our economies. 
My own chance progress from Hong Kong to Brussels has strengthened my sense that the intellectual survivors of this century are the champions of the liberal order that was born in the last, those who understood the strong and comprehensive relationship between political pluralism and open markets. 
I lived through a time, when governor of Hong Kong, in which some Asian leaders and many of those who invested in their myth, claimed that the liberal order was not universally valid. It was, they asserted, a western cultural import, rendered irrelevant and out of date by the rediscovery of a value system that drew allegedly on Confucius and justified crony capitalism and authoritarian government. 
The Asian miracle was the cocky answer to the democratic activists and the advocates of transparency and clean government. Question the so-called Asian values and you were pointed towards the cranes, the towering office blocks and the marbled hotel lobbies. 
I was lucky to sail away from Hong Kong the day before the Thai baht crashed, the Asian economies tumbled, and the vanities of authoritarians and their business buddies were deflated. One conventional wisdom arrived as rapidly as its predecessor departed. From Seoul to Bangkok, governments and others understood the relationship between political and economic reform. 
Clean financial regulation, openness and the rule of law became Asia's watchwords. The Asian crash and subsequent recovery have reasserted the validity of classical liberal ideas everywhere. 
Europe can't boast 
That is not a bit of western bragging, less still a European crow. Europe's miserable history for too much of the past century has been the story of liberal values trampled in the mud. No European politician can claim that a belief in markets and moderation is distinctively and uniquely associated with our own conduct of political and economic affairs. 
But despite our own apostasy, liberal values did survive in our continentthanks in part to the generous and visionary leadership of the United States, and to the huge success of Europe's evolving Union. When I left Asia, it seemed to me that a main challenge to the Eu would be how much we would be prepared to stand up for and support proponents of the market economy and democracy in Asia. But now I wonder whether our main challenges may not be rather closer to home. 
How are we to respond to the Europe beyond the Union's boundaries, where many nations desire to join the Brussels club precisely because it best exemplifies the liberal order? How are we to rescue the Balkans from irreversible descent into ancient hatreds and future miseries? How can we assist Russia, Ukraine and the other new independent states to build open societies under democratic government. How do we associate the poor countries to our south, along the Mediterranean's shore, with our economic success and political stability? 
What is plain is that we will not be guided philosophically in any of these tasks by the gurus of the left. If we want to know who are likely to be the most influential thinkers of the 21st century, we need look no further than the writers of this century who did most to defend and promote the liberal agenda of the recent past. They have been vindicated. Hayek and Popper, for example, will be of more use during the adventures ahead than any of Socialism's advocates, who will lie forgotten as the millennium turns.  1999 Britain in 2000 will again play host to the world's most exuberant non-stop classical musical festival. The festival has no headquarters, no organisation and no name, but it also has no rivals. Musicloving Brits take it for granted. But foreigners are amazed by it-and increasingly book their tickets from Berlin and Bergamo. 
Pick a date in 2000: say, February 2nd. There is nothing at all special about that date (which happens to be a Wednesday). But that is the whole point. 
On February 2nd the London Philharmonic Orchestra and Emanuel Ax will perform the Brahms D minor piano concerto in London's Royal Festival Hall, followed by a suite from William Walton's score for Laurence Olivier's wartime classic, ""Henry V"". Meanwhile, across the Thames in the Barbican Hall, the London Symphony Orchestra under Pierre Boulez will be playing Boulez's own music together with Stravinsky's Petrushka,the Schoenberg piano concerto (with Daniel Barenboim as soloist) and the world premiere of a new work by the British composer George Benjamin. Anyone not in the mood for orchestral music that night can opt instead for Mitsuko Uchida's piano recital at the Wigmore Hall. 
Opera-lovers are also spoilt for choice on February 2nd. At the newly reopened Royal Opera House, Gianluigi Gelmetti conducts a performance of Otello-no, not the one by Verdi, the much more rarely performed version by Rossini. Less than a mile to the west, at the London Coliseum, the English National Opera that evening will perform another Italian opera-Puccini's La Bohemebut this time in English translation. 
Needless to say, no one planned February 2nd's lush musical offerings. No higher authority decreed which works should be performed or where. Autonomous opera companies, orchestras and impresarios took autonomous decisions. The result will be, as usual, a joyous-and unrivalled-cacophony. An equally wide range of offerings will be available on every evening save one in 2000. Only on December 25th will the national score read tacet. 
Moreover, Britain's year-long festival without a name is not confined to London. Despite Sir Simon Rattle's move to Berlin, the City of Birmingham Symphony Orchestra will continue to flourish in 2000 under its new Finnish conductor, Sakari Oramo. Birmingham's six-yearold Symphony Hall boasts acoustics as fine as any in Europe. 
Further north, Manchester's Bridgewater Hall is home to the city's Halle Orchestra, which fell on hard times during the 1990s but will enjoy a revival in 2000 under its new music director, Mark Elder. Mr Elder is the most experienced of a generation of able British conductors that includes Mark Wigglesworth, Paul Daniel and the young Daniel Harding as well as Sir Simon. 
Opera in the English north will be served in 2000 by the Leeds-based company Opera North, Scotland by Scottish Opera, Wales by the Welsh National Opera, the whole of Britain by Glyndebourne Touring Opera. The ssc maintams orchestras in the north of England, Scotland and Wales as well as the ssc Symphony Orchestra in London. One of the ornaments of Glasgow's cultural life is the Royal Scottish National Orchestra with its Russian conductor, Alexander Lazarev. Another Russian, the violinist Dmitry Sitkovetsky, leads the Ulster Orchestra in Belfast. 
England was once famously dismissed as ""the land without music"", Das Land ohne Musik. England-Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland-will all in 2000 be alive to the sound of music.  1999 In May, on the south side of the Thames, the Tate Gallery will open in the transformed Bankside Power Station. A dramatic home for the Tate's collection of 20th-century art. 
Linking the new Tate with St Paul's Cathedral and the Globe Theatre in Southwark will be the first pedestrian bridge to span the Thames in central London for over a century. It will feel the weight of 4m pairs of feet a year. The British Museum, which attracts some 6m visitors a year, completes a startling renovation with its entire inner courtyard under glass. London's museums have long looked tattier and less loved than their American counterparts. Here, at last, is an improvement. 
Watch out for the arrival of the Gilbert Silver Collection to the newly restored Somerset House (itself a marvel). The gift of Sir Arthur Gilbert, born in London in 1913, the collection, which until recently was on loan to the Los Angeles County Museum of Art, comprises some 800 works. It will be permanently on view as of May. 
The world's largest observation whee and the city's fourth-tallest structure will open; it will sweep the skyline at 135 metres, allowing visitors unrivalled bird's eye views of London and beyond. 
Oh yes, the Millennium Dome. It will open amid much hullabaloo. Some of its displays will be intriguing, some tawdry. But this is not something that will swell Londoners' pride. 
There will be a newly elected mayor. Less expensive than the dome but perhaps as big an eyesore.  1999 The 2000th anniversary of Christianity should give ample opportunity for Catholics and Protestants to be encouraged to renew their faith, as church attendance levels around the world continue to fall. Moreover, the year is also the 26th Holy Year, or Jubilee, for Roman Catholics. Holy Years have been announced every 25 years since 1300. 
Many of the religious plans to celebrate the millennium are overt in their commercialism. Some of the projects endorsed by religious leaders have been unorthodox to say the least. Take, for example, the ""Clean the Slate"" campaign in the United Kingdom, endorsed by the Chief Rabbi and the Bishop of London among others, which aims to have a million sins confessed by the end of the millennium. People of all faiths are asked to send details of their transgressions to a post office box in Oxford, or confess them on radio chat-shows. 
In the Vatican the plans are more high-tech. Catholic organisers hope that 13m credit-card devices will be sold to millennium visitors, which will store credit for a wide range of uses from entry to events to phone calls. But then arrangements in the Vatican need to be very slick to cope with the 30m pilgrims expected to visit the holy city. L5 billion ($8 billion) has been spent on preparations for the millennium. 
For Protestants around the world, June will see the millennial version of the annual ""March for Jesus"". Expect 30m Christians on the streets but little media coverage. They will be happy celebrants, in contrast to the thousands of pilgrims suffering ""messianic madness"" in Israel. The year is so significant that many pilgrims will be expecting the Battle of Gog and Magog, and even the second coming of Jesus. A security unit to deal with such problems has been set up and includes agents from Shin Bet and Mossad. 
Health permitting, the pope plans to visit the Holy Land. This will be the first papal visit since 1964. However, it is likely to stir up old conflicts about the status of the cities in the Holy Land. The Vatican believes that Jerusalem should have special status as a religious centre under international guarantee, a proposition which offends Israelis, who see Jerusalem as the country's eternal and undivided capital. The pope will probably visit Nazareth, also an Israeli city, and Bethlehem, part of the Palestinian self-rule territories. 
The problems of the Church of England-worrying about where to find 35,000 bell-ringers for January 1st and the wording of the service in the Millennium Dome-pale in comparison.  1999 It is always dangerous to proclaim that companies from one particular country are on top. In 1989 a Japanese member of parliament, Shintaro Ishihara, bragged ""There is no hope for the United States."" At the same time, various American academics lauded Japan's tradition of industrial planning. The Harvard Business Review hailed the country's ""unsurpassed"" financial regulators. And a rash of books seemed to imply that most of California would end up as a subsidiary of Matsushita. Since then, Japan's share of the world's stockmarket capitalisation has shrunk from 40% to around a tenth. 
Nowadays the same air of invincibility surrounds American companies. ""Dot.com"" books with pictures of T-skirted geeks have taken the place of all those worthy tributes to kaizen. Flexibility, speed, inventiveness, ruthlessness are just a few of the virtues that are deemed to be innately American. In Fortune's annual list of the world's most admired companies, the top ten firms in 1999 all came from the United States; and there were only three non-Americans-Sony, Toyota and DaimlerChrysler-in the top 25. 
Has everybody got it wrong again? The broad answer is no. Even if you think that the American stockmarket is overvalued, even if you are sceptical about the ""new economy"", American firms are still, by most measures of competitiveness, beating the Bejesus out of their peers. Yet there are a few signs in Europe (and to a lesser extent in Japan) that firms are beginning to learn how to fight back. To paraphrase Winston Churchill, the coming year may not be the beginning of the end of American domination; but it might just be the end of the beginning. 
Start with the presumption that in business, even more than politics, the only constant thing is change. One method by which American firms caught up with their Japanese peers (assuming that they were ever behind in the first place, which is another debate) was by copying them. All those books about total quality management and lean production had an effect. Can the Europeans and Japanese catch up too? Today, the superiority of the Americans is evident but it is not universal. There are a few industries (luxury goods, for instance, in the case of Europe; consumer electronics for Japan) where the Americans are still behind. And in some ""neutral"" geographic territories, non-Americans are also doing pretty well. Japanese firms have a strong position in developing Asia, European ones in Latin America. 
The Americans are ahead overall because, first, they are leaner than their peers; and, second, they have embraced new technology. Buoyed by fads like re-engineering, American firms spent much of the early 1990s slimming not just their blue-collar workforce but also their managerial ranks; and they have kept on slimming and outsourcing jobs to other places. By contrast, in Europe and Japan, companies have, depending on your point of view, been kinder, lazier, unfairly restrained by their governments or simply true to their stakeholder principles. Although sales growth in Europe has broadly kept pace with America, profit margins in continental Europe are roughly half those in America. 
But there are signs of change. Already investment bankers are talking about European firms taking a much more aggressive, ""American"" approach to mergers and acquisitions. Certainly, European giants such as Daimler-Benz (now DaimlerChrysler) and Fiat that might once have considered themselves invulnerable, have begun to lop off ""noncore"" operations. Shareholder activism is on the rise in Europe; so is performancerelated pay. 
American firms have always been able to sell to 250m people on their doorstep. Now, thanks to the single market and the single currency, European firms should be able to reap similar economies of scale. Compared with America, Europe has twice as many car makers, eight times as many rail-engine manufacturers and ten times as many tractor and battery makers. 
Ten years ago there was much talk about how Japanese firms had a technological edge over the West. That now seems laughable. Not only do American firms dominate most of the well-known high-tech industries like computers, biotechnology and software, but even in more humdrum industries, like plastics and construction, American companies have been quicker to embrace both the Internet and e-commerce. 
But Europe in particular is not without hope. In pharmaceuticals, the continent is America's equal. There are a few parts of the continent-Finland for instance-that are actually more wired than America. And in one increasingly crucial technology, wireless telephony, Europe enjoys a sizable lead, thanks to firms like Nokia, Ericsson and VodafoneAirtouch, and the pervasiveness of the GsM standard. Europe and Japan, which is also ahead of America, will be the first two markets to introduce a common global standard. As the Internet migrates to ""smart"" hand-held devices, that could give the non-Americans a spur. 
Continental Europe is a morass of interfering regulators, high taxes and inflexible rules. Even were a French business leader to emerge who had the technological brain of Bill Gates and the restructuring zeal of Jack Welch, what could he or she do to get round the country's new 35-hour week? Or the Eu's social charter? 
These rules have long been the American businessman's best friend. European leaders like to insist that the shackles are coming off-even in Paris ""regulation"" has become something of a dirty word-but there is a need to hurry. The consultants at McKinsey reckon that only a fifth of world output, or $6 trillion out of $28 trillion, is at present globally contestable-that is, open to global competition in products, service or ownership. But within 30 years, as various economies (for example, China and India) and industries (retail and financial services) open up, four-fifths of the world economy will be global. That is the prize that the rest of the world's business leaders need to try and wrest away from American companies. But they had better get a move on. 
John Micklethwait: New York bureau chief, The Economist. Co-author, ""A Future Perfect: The Essentials of Globalisation"". published in 2000.  1999 It will be a bruising year for car companies, which are still the mainstay of manufacturing industry in most countries: a time of profitless prosperity. And as car companies go, so may go many others. They will have to cope both with a normal cyclical downturn in the market in most countries, and with the need to reinvent themselves. Expect more mergers to mop up excess capacity: the merger of Daimler and Chrysler has already triggered Renault's fusion with Nissan and Ford's purchase of Volvo. The ways in which cars are made, distributed and sold will also change. New forms of propulsion are being developed that might one day replace the internal combustion engine. And the vehicles themselves are becoming more complex, with more niche products, cars that no longer fit into simple categories. 
The long boom in America, which will see record sales of more than 17m cars and light trucks in 1999 (up from the previous 1986 record of 16.2m), is coming to an end. The huge market in minivans (an odd name for vehicles that look like bungalows on wheels), beloved by Americans, is weakening. Europe's record sales of 16m surprised the industry in 1999. Most companies think the market will fall in 2000, putting further pressure on their slim profit margins. In Japan there is no end to the stagnation that has hurt all the manufacturers. And Brazil is going from bad to worse, racking up losses for the global car companies that have piled billions into new factories there, in the hope of riding the surge in car sales that goes with rapid economic development. Tight credit and high interest rates have wrecked the car market as the government struggles to stabilise the economy after the crisis that began in 1998. 
Outside the special case of Brazil, the market problems are most acute in Europe. There is a basic 30% over-capacity in the European market. Features such as air conditioning, electronic brakes and suspension control are now becoming standard even in small, inexpensive cars, whereas ten years ago they were confined to executive models. European prices have been slipping by about 2.5% a year, enough to swallow improvements in productivity. 
Only DaimlerChrysler and Volkswagen are making decent profits. General Motors and Ford are barely making money on their huge European sales. Fiat is actually losing money. All this will get worse in 2000. Growing consumer resistance to high prices in Britain (estimated to be about a fifth higher than continental markets) is spurring the European Commission to scrutinise ""block exemption"", the system that permits car makers to restrict sales to exclusive dealer networks, thus enabling them to keep prices high. When the exemption expires in 2002, it is unlikely to be renewed. So expect car prices in Europe to edge down, especially as the euro promotes transparency and makes for a regional single market. In Britain both Volkswagen and Ford, faced with customers waiting for prices to fall, have had to promise to reimburse customers for any cuts that take place after their purchase. 
The consolidation that started with DaimlerChrysler will continue in Europe and in Asia. General Motors gets ever closer to absorbing Daewoo, a bankrupt South Korean manufacturer. Fiat and Psn Peugeot Citroen are the two European companies most likely to be absorbed by bigger groups before the end of 2000. Car companies need to have sales of around 4m-5m a year to benefit from economies of scale. This is the strategy that has made Volkswagen so successful in recent years: it is now twice the size of Fiat or Peugeot. In a sense, being global does not matter in itself; it just happens to be the best way to reach the right size. 
As for the predators, both Ford and DaimlerChrysler are on the prowl again. Daimler will probably snap up Peugeot. Ford is renewing its interest in Fiat as a way out of losses in its medium and small cars in Europe. General Motors has been studying a proposal to buy a stake in Fiat's car division and pool its operations with GM Europe. Neither of these American giants can sustain the slim pickings they earn in the European market these days. 
After dithering about it for some time, car companies-especially in America-are waking up to the fact that the Internet will have a big impact on retailing. That is why they are rushing to shorten the order-to-delivery time as customers increasingly want to specify the options and colour from information on a website (after taking a virtual test drive) and then nip round to a local showroom to pick up the keys in a couple of weeks. If car companies can master this, each vehicle on an assembly line will be customised for the buyer; rather in the way Dell Computers does with personal computers. 
Another change comes from manufacturing: Audi is launching a new small car built on a sort of ""space frame"", which amounts to clipping together stressed lengths of aluminium, giving the car its strength, rather than relying on a body shell. The impact of this technology is to permit small production runs. 
Watch out for new types of vehicles in 2000 that are impossible to categorise. For example, Ford's biggest minivan, the Lincoln Navigator, is also a luxury vehicle; likewise the startling rT Cruiser that DaimlerChrysler launches in the spring can either be seen as one of those old ""woody"" American station wagons or as a roomy saloon car that converts into a multi-purpose vehicle. Toyota's revolutionary hybrid Prius model, already selling well in Japan and coming to America and Europe in the summer, is also a new type of vehicle. It runs off a battery electric motor in town to cut pollution and uses a small petrol engine on the open road or to charge the battery. Fewer fumes and fewer companies-the future of the car industry becomes a little less foggy in 2000. 
Iain Carson: industry editor, The Economist.  1999 What exactly do sexy technologies like Internet links and solar-energy panels have to do with petrol stations, the grimy watering holes of the Industrial Age? At face value, nothing. Yet you will see both technologies spread like wildfire across the retail petrol outlets of some of the world's biggest oil companies in 2000. The reasons behind this explain why Big Oil is in big trouble, and suggest an early, if still hazy, outline of the energy industry of the next century. 
The upheaval that traumatised the oil industry in 1999 will continue in 2000, though not for the reason that some suspect. Many have pointed to the roller-coaster ride that oil prices have taken of late, bouncing between $10 and $25 a barrel, as the reason for the merger frenzy that produced the marriages of Exxon with Mobil, Br with Amoco and Arco, and TotalFina with Elf. Yet the price of oil is less important than it seems. 
This is because two forces much more powerful than the fickle oil price are driving the restructuring: the rise of markets, and growing public alarm over global warming. These twin forces are already beginning to transform petroleum from the world's most strategic asset into just another commodity; in time, they may even make it yesterday's fuel. 
To see why, consider an experiment with the first of those two sexy technologies. In America, sr intends to offer some customers who pump their own petrol Internet information, such as weather, road conditions and area maps. The reason companies want to do this is to control costs. Such technology will make pumps so smart that they can re-order petrol as they are about to run out or e-mail for help as things go wrong. 
The pressure to cut costs in the oil industry will only increase as institutional shareholders clamour for better returns: oil shares have had the worst total returns on investor capital of any major industrial sector in the 1990s. It is precisely such pressure that is making the dinosaurs of Big Oil dance so nimbly. While no new colossus the size of Exxon Mobil can emerge, look for the consolidation to continue in 2000 among the mid-sized players like Chevron, Texaco and Eni. 
Get ready too for a fire sale. In addition to merging like mad, firms of all sizes will shed peripheral assets in a desire to convince investors that they will stick to their knitting. Others will sell assets under orders from anti-trust authorities. The big winners will be the nimble entrepreneurs and businesses who could become serious competitive threats to the oil majors. For example, look for firms such as PetroPlus in Europe to expand in refining (ar is one to watch for big disposals in that area), and expect Dow Chemical in America to gobble up speciality chemicals units (as Shell and TotalFina-Elf hive off petrochemicals). The few oil companies that still have some coal assets, such as Exxon Mobil, are also likely to dump these soon. 
Green Giants? Another factor that will transform the oil business in 2000 is growing concern over the environment. At one level, environmental concern is propelled by the Kyoto protocol on global warming, a treaty signed in 1997 that commits the developed economies to make cuts in carbon emissions. This treaty is not just un fluff: it might prove to be the death knell for those oil and coal producers that do not change their ways. 
Government negotiators are due to meet in late 2000 at a follow-up summit to Kyoto in order to hammer out details. It is likely that the Clinton administration, preoccupied with the presidential election in November and fearful of the anti-Kyoto Republican Senate, will push for a postponement of the gathering. But, even if America succeeds, public concern will ensure that global warming stays on the minds of oil bosses. 
That is why they will make big investments in 2000 in cleaner technologies. Natural gas, which is much cleaner than coal or oil, will attract the lion's share of investment. Demand for gas is forecast to grow twice as fast as that for oil over the next decade. A big spur to this dash for gas will be the progressive liberalisation of the gas and electricity markets in Europe and America in 2000. Indeed, the two markets are fast converging in America and in Britain; this will accelerate through ever freer international trading of power. This coming liberalisation will drive some oil companies, in particular Shell and Texaco, to build a bigger presence in power generation. One may even gobble up a big power company during 2000. Watch too for the more adventurous oil giants to venture into the thorny retail gas and electricity game. The European Commission has ordered Eu countries to allow their biggest electricity customers free choice of supplier. In 2000, gas markets will be thrown open. 
The Kyoto treaty is changing the rules of oil in a broader sense too. Markets are already beginning to accept that the aims of Kyoto, if not the terms of the treaty itself, are inevitable. The result has been a flurry of voluntary schemes by companies and national governments to reduce emissions and encourage carbon trading. The result could be that the aims of the Kyoto treaty may well be achieved by a more market-friendly means, than if the politicians forge ahead with a heavy-handed accord. 
Some energy companies will even begin investing heavily in renewable technologies like fuel cells. DaimlerChrysler, Ford and Toyota promise to bring zero-emission fuel-cell cars to market as soon as 2004. As fantasy fast approaches market reality, look for oil companies to invest in rival fuel infrastructure, ranging from methanol to hydrogen to ""clean"" petrol. Oil companies will also increase investments in forestry for biomass energy, and wind power. One scenario that Shell is contemplating is that half of the firm's revenues will come from renewable energy by 2050. 
If that sounds implausible, consider the curious sight of solar panels popping up on top of BP and Shell petrol stations. Why in the world are the biggest purveyors of petrol exposing exactly how filthy their fuel is by installing clean, green solar panels? The reason is that they have already figured out what the rest of Big Oil will begin to realise in 2000: that the rise of greenery, Kyoto or not, spells bad news for those who refuse to embrace cleaner technologies. Small wonder, then, that sr has become the world's biggest solar-power company. 
Vijay Vaitheeswaran: environment and energy correspondent, The Economist.  1999 Still in swaddling clothes at the start of the century, the telecoms industry now feels itself prepared to dominate our lives in the next. Yet 2000 will see the industry's confidence sorely tested. In particular, the telecoms industry's ability to buy its way out of trouble or into new markets is increasingly in doubt: this despite the fact that the stockmarket capitalisation of the industry worldwide is in excess of $1 trillion. 
The primary issue-half opportunity, half threat-is ""convergence"". The term refers to the elision between once-distinct telecoms technologies-the conventional fixed telephone and the newer mobile variety or the public switched telephone network (PSTN) and the Internet. But it also applies to the industrial meshing of the telecoms sector with the worlds of IT, media and entertainment. 
The phrase most commonly used to describe the convergence process to date is ""a blurring of distinctions"" between technologies and industries. Those likely to prosper in 2000 will be those who are able to see things with pin-sharp clarity. 
On paper, the traditional telephone companies are well-placed to operate on all three fronts. Building on their traditional dominance of fixed telephony, they were among the pioneers of mobile services and were only slightly late in arriving on the Internet scene. For most old-style operators, the growth in mobile-telephone and Internet revenues has obscured the rapid decline in traditional telephone revenues, which followed the introduction of competition in developed markets in the second half of the 1990s. These companies were able to buy into the Internet and mobile-phone markets thanks only to the streams of profits from standard wired-phone networks. 
As these funds dry up or disappear, a question mark hangs over the ability of these companies to sustain their assaults on newer markets. Their war chests are not yet empty, but it is becoming increasingly difficult to see how they will replenish them the next time around. 
Events in 2000 will show the way. Far from attempting to create converged companies capable of satisfying custourer requirements in telephony, mobiles and the Internet as a ""one-stop shop"", many major players will seek to spin off their mobile and Internet arms as separate entities. This would enable these operating divisions to raise muchneeded investment capital and to prune costs to levels nearer the ""leaner and meaner"" upstarts they face. 
Although sound, this strategy raises two questions. First, what becomes of the ancient parent, left only with a dwindling share of a fixed telephony market whose profitability is in steady decline? Second, what if the world's tech-obsessed bourses lose their appetites for telecoms and Internet shares before separate subsidiaries can be floated? 
The second question concerns new and old carriers alike. Outside the United States, there are still billions of dollars to be released in government-held equity in the old national telephone companies. Added to this, 2000 will see repeated calls on the world's markets for cash-raising bonds, capital enlargements and loans. Much of the planned expansion in fields such as mobile phones and the Internet has been predicated on the ready access to such funding. 
These cash calls are not getting any lighter. Take mobile phones: the nextgeneration wireless networks are set to be licensed in 2000 in most big countries. Whether or not we witness a stampede for these so-called ""3G"" licences-for a technology supporting mobile access to voice, data, the Internet and video-will depend on whether would-be bidders believe capital will be available to build these new networks. 
This is an important point. Ahead of the commercial launch of 3G networks-- due in 2002-existing cellular networks will become more and more able to support the needs of an information-hungry population. Expect routine e-mail access and the ability of mobile users to ""surf' stripped-down versions of web pages from their handsets to gain prominence in 2000. Given the current growth in the cellular market-which should see a staggering 70% of the populations in the Nordic region owning a cellphone in 2000-there is a risk that 3G systems will be obsolete before they are off the ground. 
Jim Chalmers: editor, Public Network Europe.  1999 The gadget of choice for children of all ages-especially well-heeled ones in their 30s and up-is going to be Sony's new video-game machine. With a graphics engine capable of generating 75m polygons (the basic unit of 3D models) per second, PlayStation2 has five times the power of today's most powerful graphics workstations. But what makes PlayStation2 a natural winner is that it is not simply a videogame console. Apart from being able to play video games on discs with frighteningly realistic graphics and even download new games from the Internet, it can double as a DVD movie and CD audio player. Expect to see PlayStation2 being used as much for downloading and playing movies as for zapping aliens. When? The new Sony game machine hits the Japanese market on March 4th with a price tag of Y39,800 ($370). The rest of Asia will see it during the summer, while America and Europe will have to wait until the autumn. And fast on its heels will come the new Nintendo console, to be called Dolphin. 
The portable video phone will finally be coming to a shop near you. Kyocera has been selling its tiny VisualPhone VP-210 in Japan since May 1999. With its built-in video camera and screen, the portable phone allows a person to see who he or she is talking to, while being seen as well as heard in return. Kyocera's handset weighs a mere 165 grams and has a recommended price of 40,000. Orange, a. British cell-phone company, plans to go one better when it launches its as-yet unnamed wireless video phone-cum-pocket organiser this summer. Its touch-screen can recognise and transmit handwriting as well as let the user download e-mail and surf the Internet. The pocket-sized gizmo can send and receive video phone calls as well. 
The most politically correct form of private transport is going to be the hybrid car. Since launching its little Prius model in December 1997, Toyota has surprised everyone (including itself by selling 30,000 of these part-petrol, part-electric cars that get nearly 80 miles to the metric gallon. Honda has now gone one better with a hybrid called Insight that does 100 miles per gallon-and will soon be coming down your road soon. 
Pocket-sized digital cameras have been around since Casio shook the photographic world with its nifty little QV10 five years ago. But it had only 350,000 pixels (picture elements) per frame against photographic film's millions. Now Japan's digital camera makers are introducing ""mega-pixel"" models. These produce images with a lifelike 2m-3m pixels. Canon's PowerShot SlO costs Y89,900. 
Nicholas Valery: Tokyo bureau chief, 
The Economist.  1999 Chief executives of America's top 200 companies will take home 400 times the wage of the average factory worker, if share options hold up. 
More and more large corporations will get into the venture-capital business in the years ahead. Is this an oxymoron? Can an established company take the risks and spare the management to invest in start-ups? Unequivocally the answer is yes. In an era when many large firms are questioning the productivity of their investments in traditional R&D laboratories, venture organisations represent an intriguing alternative. 
Much of this interest is being stimulated by the recent success of independent venture-capitalism: for example, the rapid growth of capital under management and the spectacular returns of many funds in recent years. Although total disbursements from the venture industry over the past two decades have been far less than the R&D spending of either isNt or General Motors, the economic successes of venture-backed firms-such as Intel, Microsoft, Yahoo, Genentech and Cisco Systems-have been profound. As a result, several hundred corporate-venture programmes have been established over the past three years to invest in entrepreneurial ventures, whether in spin-outs of internal concerns or in entities outside the firm. Although American and Japanese corporations have taken the lead, European companies-including France Telecom, Reuters and Siemens-are becoming increasingly active as well. 
In the excitement about the current surge of corporate venture-capital activity, it is easy to lose sight of the fact that similar programmes have existed in the past. The first corporate funds began in the mid-1960s. These corporate efforts were spurred by the successes of the first private venture-capital funds, which had backed such firms as Digital Equipment, Memorex, Raychem and Scientific Data Systems. Intrigued by this success, large companies began establishing divisions that emulated venture capitalists. But in 1973, the market for new public offerings-the primary avenue through which venture capitalists exit successful investments-abruptly declined. 
A relaxation of the rules allowing pension funds to invest and an increase in the number and strength of independent venture capitalists attracted big corporations back into the business in the 1980s. By 1986 corporate funds managed $2 billion, or nearly 12% of the total pool of venture capital. After the stockmarket crash of 1987, however, corporations scaled back: by 1992 the number of corporate venture programmes had fallen by one-third and their capital represented only 51 of the venture pool. 
These patterns have led many to conclude that corporate venture-capital is inherently unstable, and unlikely to be successful. In order to test this criticism, we examined over 30,000 investments in entrepreneurial firms by venture-capital organisations in the VentureOne database of private equity financings. Far from being outright failures, corporateventure investments in entrepreneurial firms appear to be at least as successful (using such measures as the probability of a portfolio firm going public) as those backed by independent venture organisations. 
But success is not uniform. The success of the corporate programmes is particularly pronounced for investments in which there is strategic overlap between the corporate parent and the portfolio firm. The success of investments when there is no overlap is much lower. Similar patterns emerge when the duration of the corporate programmes themselves is examined: the empirical evidence suggests that corporate programmes without a strategic focus are less stable than those of independent funds. The programmes frequently cease operations after only a few investments. Corporations with a strong strategic focus are almost as stable as independent funds. These insights are corroborated by field-based research. Corporate-venture managers can select higher quality firms in related industries, and then more effectively add value to these firms afterwards. This is more difficult when the portfolio company is in an industry far removed from that of the parent corporation. 
Why did corporations invest in areas that they did not know well in the first place? The diffuse nature of unsuccessful programmes appears to have reflected internal dissension about the programmes' goals. In many cases, important segments of the corporation, such as the legal department or R&D personnel, were uncomfortable with the programme and sought to restrict it to investing in areas where the corporation had few competing operations. In other instances, senior executives had inflated expectations about how rapidly widely dispersed investments could affect corporate profitability. 
Corporations will come under growing pressure to rethink their innovation plans. The enormous surge in venture-financing, the success of these firms in creating market value, will make corporate venture-capital programmes part of the tool kit for major corporations around the world.  1999 The need for management development has never been more pressing. The world is awash with money but short on the talent needed to meet the combined challenges of globalisation, new technologies and an increasingly entrepreneurial culture. If capitalism is to be democratised through more and more small and medium enterprises, the engines of employment growth, then we can no longer afford good-quality management education to be accessible only to a privileged few. This is a matter of national competitiveness. 
But to serve the boardroom of the multinational, management education must also change. The profile of the successful corporate leader grows ever more complex. The ideal chief executive in 2000 has to be global in perspective yet willing to sweat over the details. He or she must be entrepreneurial yet also be a team player; able to articulate a vision, yet flexible enough to change the strategy whenever necessary. 
Can the businessschool industry, invented in the United States around 100 years ago, foster such new and diverse talents? The robust new insights to guide and frame management practice still flow primarily from academics at the leading schools. But corporate leaders in future will be more likely to cherrypick the ideas of individual academic gurus than adopt the overall intellectual leadership of a particular academic brand. In addition, many good ideas are flowing from the very consultants whom the top business schools trained. Independent-minded academics are not always as inclined as consultants to team up and tackle the really big problems. 
A second strength of business schools is that fast-growing knowledge businesses, including consulting firms, investment banks and high-tech companies, remain heavy recruiters of MBAs. The business schools have done the screening for them. But, increasingly, industrial firms are being priced out of the MBA market at the top schools. In future more companies will turn to talented BA graduates and put them through in-house training programmes. At Motorola, British Aerospace and many other leading multinationals, training can lead to MBA degrees in their own corporate universities. This is the fastest-growing segment of the management development market. 
To retain their premium status, the top business schools will have to attract top faculty talent. A continuous flow of new ideas and a community that fosters creativity are the lifeblood of any academic institution. As in any other industry, business schools need a clear positioning in the marketplace. 
Most business schools do not develop important new ideas but, acting as metoo competitors, repackage the ideas of others at lower prices. Most are in fact training and thinly veiled consulting organisations. The barriers to entry are minimal; a warm body and a chalkboard and you have a business school. There are well over 100 MBA programmes in the United Kingdom and the accreditation process to provide some modest quality control cannot keep pace. However, the demand for management education is burgeoning and, although some of the MBAs granted may not be worth much, not everyone can go to one of the top schools. 
Internet delivery of management training promises to expand the market further. The virtual University of Phoenix has more MBAs enrolled than any other university in the United States. For basic skills training in subjects such as accounting, finance and quantitative methods, distance learning may be feasible. 
But for those softer skills in human resources management, leadership and team-building, face-to-face interaction among students and faculty will remain essential to the learning process. 
The top business schools will use Internet delivery and study groups connected by email to supplement on-site coursework in their part-time or executive MBA programmes. However, there will always be a market for the full-time MBA among bright twenty-somethings who want to take time out to take stock of their career path, brush up on the latest thinking, perhaps develop a business plan for a start-up, and become a member of a global alumni network. But, if Internetdelivered management education develops further, will the quality gap close to the point that the higher prices charged by the traditional business schools are no longer sustainable? 
Recalling the famous case-study on Japanese Honda's entry into the United States motorcycle market, the relative indifference of the top business schools to the virtual MBA is reminiscent of HarleyDavidson's unfortunate smugness. Could the virtual University of Phoenix be today's academic equivalent of the Honda motorcycle of 1965?

For today's bosses there is nothing more shaming than appearing not ""to get"" the Internet. When Oracle's Larry Ellison proclaims that ""the Internet changes everything"" or Intel's Andy Grove warns that in five years' time ""all companies will be Internet companies or they won't be companies at all"", few dare to disagree. But what is it that they are agreeing with? What kind of industrial revolution are they suddenly so desperate to embrace? 
Between 1995 and 1997, when the World Wide Web began emerging as a mass market platform, interest in the Internet as a business opportunity was focused on its potential as a marketing tool and an additional, low-cost distribution channel. Pioneers, such as Dell Computer, also showed that for some companies it could offer a more direct way of reaching customers, cutting out middlemen and resellers who didn't add much value. But if that was interesting for many (and alarming for a few), it was not yet truly compelling. While most media attention was on the glamorous consumer side of the web-content and shopping-and on the gravity-defying share prices of upstart Internet firms such as Amazon.com and Yahoo!, serious, grown-up businesses appeared to be biding their time. 
But no longer. The Internet is beginning to turn mainstream business upside down and inside out. It is fundamentally changing the way many companies operate, most obviously in high-tech, but even in metal-bashing industries. And web-based transactions-buying and selling over the Internet-are only the tip of a massive and expanding iceberg. While some companies are indeed using the Internet to deal directly with their customers for the first time, others are using the Internet's reach and ubiquity to intensify relationships with trading partners, request quotes or liquidate surplus inventory by auction. 
The Internet is making it possible for companies to lower costs dramatically across their supply-and-demand chains, take customer service to undreamed-of new levels, enter markets from which they were previously excluded by geography, create new revenue streams and ultimately redefine the very nature of their business. Entirely new companies are appearing in industries ranging from advertising to road haulage to chemicals. Using the connectivity of the Internet, these ""infomediaries"" create super-efficient electronic marketplaces, bringing together buyers and sellers who previously could not find each other. 
Although limelight-hogging consumer e-commerce is growing fast, it is as nothing compared with both the speed and the absolute amount of intercompany trade in goods over the Internet. Forrester Research, a technology consultancy, reckons that whereas business-to-consumer e-commerce in America (still the most ""wired"" country by some way) will go from $8 billion last year to $108 billion in 2003, business-tobusiness e-commerce will surge from $43 billion to $1.3 trillion in the same period. Forrester expects Britain and Germany to go into the same ""hypergrowth"" stage of e-business about two years after America, with Japan, Italy and France a further two years behind. 
And just as countries are moving towards e-business hyper-growth at slightly different paces, so too are industries. Unsurprisingly, computing and electronics adopted and evangelised the Internet first and are therefore already well on the way to achieving critical mass. But aerospace, telecoms and the car industry are also undergoing massive Internetdriven change and are not far behind. The same is true of other industries, such as financial services, that have appropriate systems-integration skills and have invested heavily in the right kind of iT infrastructure. 
While nimble Internet start-ups are a ceaseless source of business model innovation and have been responsible for giving established giants a nerve-jangling wake-up call (one that rang worryingly late in some boardrooms), it is big companies with real financial and market heft that are now providing the main traction for e-business. Lou Gerstner, the head of IBm, likes to describe the new ""dot.com"" firms as ""fireflies before the storm-all stirred up, throwing off sparks."" According to Mr Gerstner, the storm that is now arriving is ""when the thousands and thousands of institutions that exist today seize the power of this global computing and communications infrastructure and use it to transform themselves. That's the real revolution."" 
Mr Gerstner may have a prejudice in favour of big companies. After all, he runs one of the biggest in the world. But he is right. When a Ford, a Wal-Mart, a BancOne or General Electric (GE) turns itself into an e-business, it is an event that reverberates. Traditionally, IT investments have been inward-looking, concentrated on making each enterprise more efficient in isolation. By contrast, the Internet is all about communicating, connecting and transacting with the outside world. With e-business, the benefits should come not just from speeding up and automating one's own internal processes, but from extending those efficiency gains to suppliers and customers. 
When a really large company, at considerable cost in terms of both money and upheaval, moves some or all of its operations to the web, it puts its trading partners under intense pressure to do the same. Suppliers, and even some customers, who insist on continuing to trade the old-fashioned way will get frozen out, while those that make the effort will win more of the available business. 
And that effort involves more than just iT spending: it is cultural too. No longer can any business see itself as a more or less free-standing entity. It must become part of an e-business ecosystem in which firms that trade with each other use the Internet to allow their partners and customers to enter deep into their internal systems and processes. To reap the rewards of a truly integrated value chain requires a degree of openness and flexibility that comes naturally to few firms. As an executive at Cisco Systems, the dominant supplier of networking gear that many regard as the ultimate ebusiness, puts it, ""You have to be ready to open the kimono."" 
That in turn may mean radically reappraising what your company does or even is. Jack Welch has put ""dyb.com""destroyyourbusiness-teams into every one of GE's operating units to force the Internet revolution through the huge firm. Ford is giving serious consideration to outsourcing all its manufacturing, stripping the company down to its essentials of product development, brand management and customer service. Others will follow. software as a service to be paid for. Another booming sector will be industry portals and hubs. For more than a decade, multinationals have been investing billions of dollars in complex systems designed to automate their internal inventory, sales and supply-chain operations. The hardest part has been bringing their business partners-suppliers, customers, service providersinto the loop: the cacophony of different technologies and data formats is too much for most to bear. The Internet has become the great mediator: the largest single barrier-connectivity-disappears; hubs will emerge in industry clusters to provide a lingua franca for sharing data, from product and price lists to shipping information. 
The aim of this is not so much to help companies sell more goods, but to lower the cost of doing so. This will change the economic shape of the industry. From a race between speedy start-ups to capture new consumer markets, it will become a battle of titans as large, established firms in everything from manufacturing to accounting try to use the Internet to gain advantage over their competitors. The new companies that arise will be those that help companies do this best, whether by providing software, services or a marketplace. A slowing stockmarket will leave scars, but the amount of money available for Internet ventures will remain huge: this is an industrial revolution, not a tulip bubble, and good investors always knew that supernormal capitalisations could not last. 
The other technology trends of the year will all stem from the Internet. Mobile phones using the Wireless Application Protocol will hit the streets of Europe, Asia and America, bringing web access, e-mail, even banking to pocket-sized devices. This is the first big step towards the emergence of handheld devices, from personal digital assistants to smart phones, as a rival to the rc for the Internet throne. Sony's PlayStation2 will mark the rise of the consumer-electronics industry as the rc's other competitor. While the rc will improve and become more popular, this is no longer a one-box game. 2000 will be the year when the seeds of something bigger begin to sprout.

Matthew Symonds: IT and communications editor, The Economist.  1999 Peter Drucker, the grand old man of management science, predicts an unlikely twist that e-commerce will give to every business. 
Traditional multinationals will, in time, be killed by e-commerce. The ecommerce delivery of goods, of services, of repairs, spare parts and maintenance, will require a different organisation from that of any multinational today. It will also require a different mindset, a different top management and, in the end, different definitions of performance. Indeed, the very way performance is measured will change. 
In most businesses today delivery is considered a ""support"" function, a routine to be taken care of by clerks. It is taken for granted unless something goes 
dramatically wrong. But under e-commerce delivery will become the one area in which a business can truly distinguish itself. It will become the critical ""core competence"". Its speed, quality and responsiveness may well become the decisive competitive factor even where brands seem to be entrenched. And there is no existing multinational and altogether very few businesses which are organised for it. Very few yet even think that way. 
The railway, invented in 1829, mastered distance. This explains why, more than any other of the inventions of the industrial revolution, the railway changed every nation's economy and workforce. It changed humanity's mindset, its horizon, its ""mental geography"". 
E-commerce does not merely master distance, it eliminates it. There is no reason why, under e-commerce, the vendor has to be in any particular place. In fact, the customer as a rule does not know and does not care where the ecommerce vendor is located. And the ecommerce vendor in turn, for example Amazon.com, today the world's biggest book seller, neither knows nor cares where the purchase order comes from. 
If the purchase is itself electronic information-a software program or a trade on a stockmarket-there is no delivery problem. The ""product"" itself is, after all, only an entry in a computer memory. It has a legal but no physical existence. (There is, however, a considerable tax problem with this type of trade in electronically delivered goods, which will give the world's tax authorities a headache in 2000. The intelligent ones will drop such taxes, the unintelligent ones will devise nonsense rules of control.) 
If the purchase is a book, there is still not much of a delivery problem. Books ship easily, have high value-toweight ratios and pass without much trouble across national boundaries and through customs. But a tractor has to be delivered to where the customer is and it can neither be delivered electronically nor by parcel post. 
Delivery also seems to be needed for newspapers and magazines, that is, for the carriers of printed information. At least, none of the attempts made so far to sell an ""on-line"" edition to be read on the subscriber's computer or ""downloaded"" from it, has been a great success. Subscribers want their paper delivered to the doorstep. 
Medical diagnosis and test results are increasingly being put on the Internet. But practically everything to do with sickness care-from the physician's examination to surgery, medication and physical rehabilitation-has to be delivered where the patient is. And so does all after-purchase service, whether it is servicing a physical product, for example, a machine or a bicycle, or something as non-physical as a bank loan. 
Cars by e-mail 
But at the same time any business, and indeed any institution, that can organise delivery can operate in any market anywhere, without having any physical presence there. 
One example: one of the fastestgrowing businesses in the United States today is an e-mail seller of new passenger automobiles: CarsDirect.com. Based in a Los Angeles suburb, it was founded as recently as January 1999. CarsDirect.com became in July 1999 one of the 20 largest car dealers in the country, operating in 40 of the 50 states of the Union, and selling 1,000 vehicles a month. It does not owe its success to cheaper prices or to particular prowess in selling cars; in fact in these areas it still lags well behind such older and bigger e-commerce automobile dealers as Autobytel.com or CarPoint.com, a Microsoft subsidiary. But CarsDirect, unlike its competitors, has organised a unique delivery system. It has signed up 1,100 traditional dealers throughout the country to deliver CarsDirect's sales to the local purchaser, with a guaranteed delivery date and with quality-controlled service. 
Delivery is equally important-it may indeed be more important-in e-commerce between businesses. And by all indications e-commerce between businesses is growing even faster than e-retail commerce and is becoming transnational even faster. 
But e-commerce separates, for the first time in business history, selling and purchase. Selling is completed when the order has been received and paid for. Purchasing is completed only when the purchase has been delivered and actually not until it satisfies the purchaser's want. And whereas ecommerce demands centralisation, delivery has to be totally decentralised. It needs ultimately to be local, detailed and accurate. 
Just as e-commerce separates selling and purchasing, it separates making and selling. Under e-commerce, what we now know as ""production"" becomes procurement. There is absolutely no reason at all why any e-commerce facility should limit itself to marketing and selling one maker's products or brands. 
In fact, as both Amazon.com and CarsDirect.com show, the great strength of e-commerce is precisely that it provides the customer with a whole range of products, no matter who makes them. But in traditional business structures, selling is still seen and organised as a servant to production, or as the cost centre that ""sells what we make"". In the future e-commerce companies will ""sell what we can deliver"".  1999 By February the Y2K bug will already be fading into memory, having left a lot less damage than many had feared, but having cost a lot more to eliminate than anyone predicted. Companies that had frozen new IT projects for most of 1999 will now be free to invest in the future, not the past. And for them the future is business-to-business e-commerce. This e-business boom will shift the centre of gravity of the Internet industry towards, well, more gravity. Whereas the Internet stock boom of early 1999 was fuelled by fun consumer companies-Amazon, Yahoo!, AOL-many of the rags-to-riches stories of 2000 will be cast from far more serious stuff: industrial trading communities, web-based outsourcing services, business software providers. Although a new crop of e-business darlings will capture the headlines, most of the real ""start-ups"" will not be new companies, but entrepreneurial efforts within big companies, helping each to shift internally in time with the outside revolution. The best firms will find clever ways to encourage this, by creating in-house incubators, corporate venture-capital funds, even stock-option programmes linked to e-business results. 
Why this shift from consumers to companies? Because that is where the infrastructure is, to say nothing of the money. Assume a ""web lifestyle""-having near-constant access to computers with high-speed Internet connectionsand suddenly all sorts of services, from television to finance, naturally move to the web, where they are cheaper, faster, more efficient and far more flexible than the systems they replace. No big population is closer to a web lifestyle than America's office workers, who are sitting on a decade's investment in rcs, software and corporate networks that has never quite paid the dividends promised. The Internet brings it all together, triggering a second wave of corporate automation and the emergence of a host of business-to-business e-commerce companies and services. 
""Application hosting""-paying outside companies to run your huge databases and supply-chain software-will be one such booming e-business market. Its boosters may pitch it as ""free"" software, but in reality it is the shift from software as a product to be bought to software as a service to be paid for. Another booming sector will be industry portals and hubs. For more than a decade, multinationals have been investing billions of dollars in complex systems designed to automate their internal inventory, sales and supply-chain operations. The hardest part has been bringing their business partners-suppliers, customers, service providersinto the loop: the cacophony of different technologies and data formats is too much for most to bear. The Internet has become the great mediator: the largest single barrier-connectivity-disappears; hubs will emerge in industry clusters to provide a lingua franca for sharing data, from product and price lists to shipping information. 
The aim of this is not so much to help companies sell more goods, but to lower the cost of doing so. This will change the economic shape of the industry. From a race between speedy start-ups to capture new consumer markets, it will become a battle of titans as large, established firms in everything from manufacturing to accounting try to use the Internet to gain advantage over their competitors. The new companies that arise will be those that help companies do this best, whether by providing software, services or a marketplace. A slowing stockmarket will leave scars, but the amount of money available for Internet ventures will remain huge: this is an industrial revolution, not a tulip bubble, and good investors always knew that supernormal capitalisations could not last.

Mobile phones using the Wireless Application Protocol will hit the streets of Europe, Asia and America, bringing web access, e-mail, even banking to pocket-sized devices. This is the first big step towards the emergence of handheld devices, from personal digital assistants to smart phones, as a rival to the rc for the Internet throne.

Chris Anderson: Asia business correspondent, The Economist.  1999 The future of advertising? Seemingly, an enviable one. For the past five years, growth rates have consistently outpaced the general growth of SDP in all developed economies. And forecasters predict another decade of expansion, at an average of 8% annually. This is more than respectable for a business that saw global advertising expenditures top out last year at over $400 billion. 
Yet the compelling issues surrounding marketing and communications do not concern the size or long-term viability of our industry. The key questions grow out of the fact that mass marketing, though still the mainstay of our business, will be on the wane. Our future will involve direct interactions linking producers of goods and services to their customers. This is being mandated by digital technology and the Internet, which are driving the convergence of every form of media. And-in our almost overwhelmingly complex landscape of consumer choice and technological changethere will be an increasingly prominent role for brands and for communications initiatives with measurable results. 
So much for the short answers. To understand and unravel their implications, however, it becomes necessary to take a broader look at major developments in the recent history of consumer marketing. 
For some years now, technological innovation has been shifting the balance of power in all areas of marketing. By leading the way in the capture and manipulation of consumer data, retailers wrested a great deal of marketing clout from manufacturers. This, in turn, gave retailers a major influence on a product's success or failure, as well as an important voice in shaping new product development. 
More significant still were the shifts which empowered consumers. Overcapacity has become the rule in industry after industry, creating a glut of goods in most every product category. An increasingly outdated approach to brand management has leaned too heavily on incremental marketing strategies, such as an over-reliance on online extensions and rudimentary demographic targeting. True product differentiation-the critical ingredient of brand building-has become increasingly rare. As if those challenges were not enough, the proliferation of media has created hundreds of channels through which to reach consumers, all but sealing the fate of mass marketing. 
And yet, these changes pale in comparison to the online tsunami we are just beginning to experience. The size of today's Internet economy has been estimated at over $500 billion, and growing fast. Analysts in our business expect American online advertising revenue to grow from under $3 billion this year to more than $30 billion in five years. That is a conservative estimate, because new media, once they pick up steam, tend towards explosive growth. In 1950, Procter & Gamble spent less than 5% of its advertising dollars on a new medium called television; five years later, it was committing 80% of its budget to television. 
But the Internet is more than a medium in the traditional sense. For the first time ever, message delivery has been linked to distribution, as well as to a consumer who can make purchase decisions-at the click of a mouse. 
This explains why consumers are flocking to the web in greater numbers than anyone expected. Online purchases are accelerating, particularly in the business-to-business area. As a result, marketers are being forced to shift their priorities and come to grips with this new reality. It's not hard to see why the opportunities, and the potential pitfalls, of e-commerce are immense. 
From our point of view, what distinguishes the Internet are a number of unique and sustainable attributes. It is available whenever and wherever you want it. It is incredibly affordable. And it is interactive, That is a combination that cannot be found anywhere else in the marketing universe-which is why the Internet will fundamentally change how companies take their products and services to market in the 21st century. 
The web's combination of attributes also gives consumers unprecedented access to information, as well as leverage in shopping for price and demanding specifically customised products and services. Everyone seems to agree, for once and forever more, the customer is king. 
But the provider is also gaining an important new foothold with the customer. Because in the online world, sellers can identify individual consumers and amass considerable data regarding each and every one of them. Soon, the web will also provide even more sophisticated tools with which to discern and analyse a person's purchase patterns and behaviour. 
Those are the areas in which marketing communications will have the most to offer. As the customer perspective increasingly becomes the key driver of a company's overall business strategy, the role of marketing professionals will become more significant. After all, our key talent is in understanding and motivating consumer purchasing behaviour. We are best equipped to build relevant differentiation for brands. And people will increasingly rely on brands as qualifiers and guarantors in a world in which there is too much information and not enough time. 
Clients, also faced with an increasingly complex marketing environment and tremendous constraints on their resources, will look to us as the conductors of their marketing symphonies-choosing the optimal mix from among the persuasive disciplines, for dozens of product lines, in scores of geographies. 
So, while we still need to draw on advertising, direct marketing, public relations and design, the new campaigns we create will increasingly have to incorporate two important new online components: database marketing services and e-commerce solutions. The Internet makes knowing your customer more important than ever. 
Tom Bell, president of Young & Rubicam, sees the advertising Indus try changing beyond recognition.  1999 The first year of the new millennium will set a new and more cautious tone in financial markets-even if it starts with a Y2K bump. The party of the 1990s had been a wonderful one for most markets: in the developed world Japanese equities were the only serious casualty of the decade. But by the final months of 1999 there was already an awareness that no party lasts for ever and that at some stage it would be time to step out into the night and head for home. 
Looked at globally the great monetary achievement of the 1990s had been the conquest of inflation, the scourge of the second half of the 20th century. Markets celebrated that. They also tried to find a way of celebrating-or at least coming to terms with-the burst of innovation in communications of the past five years. Yes, the new technologies will change the performance of the world economy, lifting it a notch or two, just as other bursts of technical advance have done in the past. But how do you price such innovation? And finally the 1990s saw the world economy become steadily more global, a shift in which markets themselves played a crucial part, but which sometimes brought uncomfortable surprises when one bit of the world did not play by the global rules. 
So 2000 will set the markets three tasks. The first will be to judge the broad levels of inflation that will rule during the first part of the century. Are we talking about the present range of central-bank targets of 0-2.5%? Or will inflation reach the 3-5% region? Or will global prices decline? The second task is to price innovation. Financial markets have a lot of experience of coping with technical change, but have found it tough to price the Internet-related technologies: the volatility of prices during 1998 and 1999 represents a market failure. Markets need to do better in 2000. And the third task, most obviously for the currency markets, will be to figure out how global the world really has become. One obvious question is, ""Do current accounts still matter?"" At the beginning of 1999 they thought they didn't; by the end of the year they had reconsidered that view, particularly with regard to the dollar. 
Expect then for 2000 to see markets the world over stumble towards the view that global deflation in the next half century is as likely as global inflation. Sure, there will be peaks and troughs, and the short-term concern about rising inflation will push up short-term interest rates: first for the dollar, then the euro and by the end of 2000, the yen. But global bond yields need not rise and by the end of 2000 the long-term downward trend in yields should be evident again. 
Falling bond yields will underpin equities, which may well have a rough first half of the year. Bear markets happen, bubbles burst, and American equities in particular spent much of 1999 at stretched valuations. The key to ensuring that a bear market does not damage the real economy is to give share prices an anchor. The obvious anchor will be the prospect of continued price stability. So provided the central banks retain the confidence of the markets, share prices will put in an adequate performance. If they fail, expect a difficult year for all major equity markets. 
As for the second test, expect by the end of 2000 markets to be able to price high-technology stocks with much more confidence. The shake-out will render some of the go-go valuations of mid1999 absurd, but the markets will also realise that the new technologies will lift the productivity of the entire business sector. As markets appreciate that profits will come more from clever application than from cutting-edge development, they will begin to look for the substance rather than the hype. So expect a more mature approach to valuing technology: investors will start to look for profits rather than growth. Maybe they will not demand jam today, but they will want jam tomorrow, rather than jam at some indeterminate date in the future. 
Third, assessing global pressures on currencies: in the dim and distant past (like ten years ago) markets thought a current-account deficit was a sign of economic weakness. Recently they came to see it almost as a sign of strength-a current-account deficit equals strong growth and a capital inflow, which in turn indicates confidence both at home and abroad in the economy. If markets are now becoming more cautious they will want to see deficits start to be corrected, and if the United States does not pull back its current-account deficit, expect the dollar to be hit. If that happens, the other ""Anglo"" currencies, including sterling, will be hit with it. The euro, after its sickly birth, will become a healthier but more troublesome two-year-old. It will be healthier because the European recovery will appear more secure. It will be troublesome because the ""one-size-fitsall"" interest rate will mean that twothirds of Europe has the wrong rate. Tensions between the slower growing core and the fizzing fringe will grow. Elsewhere, expect the yen to have unexpected stability and the gradual recovery of confidence in most emerging markets to continue. 
So 2000 will be a more thoughtful, more mature year in the financial markets than 1999 turned out to be. Expect bond yields globally to end the year lower than they were at the beginning; expect share prices to be steady and recovering, whatever happens in the meantime. Expect technology companies to be rated by a cool assessment as to how soon they are going to be profitable rather than how big they might become. And expect currency stability if, and only if, current-account imbalances start to shrink. As for the wild card of Y2K-the great news will be that by the end of 2000 it will have become a distant memory. But so too will the 1990s party: welcome to a more sober decade. 
Hamish McRae: author of ""The World in 2020"" and associate editor of The Independent.  1999 In most countries central banks now have more power and independence than ever before. Alan Greenspan, chairman of America's Federal Reserve, is probably the most revered central banker in world history. However, as a result of some serious monetary policy mistakes, central banks will face an uncomfortable year in 2000; some are likely to come under fierce political attack. Their prominence will start to decline. 
Central banking as we know it today is in fact a relatively recent invention. At the start of this century there were only 18 central banks; today there are 173. (When economies were on the gold standard or a dollar standard, they did not need a central bank to set interest rates.) Not only have they increased in number, but central banks have also gained independence from governments. Ten years ago, most central banks (the Fed and the Bundesbank being two main exceptions) were still firmly under the thumb of finance ministers, who told them when to change interest rates. But shortsighted politicians were often tempted to engineer a pre-election boom, which pushed up inflation. So today most central banks have been given independence and full control of the monetary reins. The new European Central Bank (ECa) has been set up as the most independent and powerful central bank in the world. Even the Bank of Japan, which has been widely blamed for Japan's prolonged slump after the bursting of its bubble, now has independence in setting interest rates. 
As well as power, many central banks have also won increased respect. This is partly due to their success in crushing inflation-now at its lowest level for almost half a century in the rich economies. But it is also partly thanks to the stunning success of Mr Greenspan in steering the American economy through almost nine years of uninterrupted, low inflationary growth-the longest peacetime expansion in American history. Mr Greenspan is worshipped almost like a god by investors who believe that he has eliminated the business cycle and so ensured ever-rising share prices. 
What might go wrong? Financial markets and the general public have excessive faith in what central banks can achieve. Their ability to steer economies with precision is much more limited than commonly realised. The immediate danger is not that inflation will return to its double-digit levels of the 1970s, for central bankers will be quick to raise interest rates if consumer prices accelerate. Instead there are new hazards to which central bankers, brought up on the idea that their sole job was to defeat inflation, have not yet woken up. Their new enemies are asset-price inflation and deflation. 
Judged by the test of low inflation, both the Fed and the Bank of Japan might be seen to have done a good job. But look closer and America's economy shows alarming signs of excess. By most standard measures, share prices look overvalued; firms and households have been on a borrowing binge; the broad M3 measure of money has been growing at its fastest rate in real terms for a quarter century; and the current-account deficit is nearing record levels. These are all classic symptoms of a bubble. The Fed has made a big mistake in ignoring share prices and these other imbalances. For history suggests that rapid increases in the prices of assets, such as shares or property, can be just as dangerous as consumer-price inflation. 
This does not mean that central banks should abandon the long-term goal of price stability, or try to target share prices. However, they should remember that price stability is not an end in itself, but only a means to the real objective of steady growth. In 2000-as America's bubble goes ""pop""-central banks will come to accept that they must widen their vision to take account of other signs of excess in setting monetary policy, such as asset prices, excessive growth in money and credit, and widening external deficits. 
The Bank of Japan's error lies at the other extreme. It has failed to realise that deflation can be even more dangerous than inflation. Since Japan's bubble of the late 1980s burst, the bank has consistently ignored the economic lessons of the 1930s and been too slow to ease monetary policy to support the economy. Although output has started to recover, Japan still shows many signs of deflation. Prices and wages are declining and output remains well below productive capacity. It is true that Japanese interest rates are close to zero, but when prices are falling, that still leaves real rates painfully high. The recent surge in the yen, which threatens to choke off Japan's fragile recovery and to worsen deflationary pressures, confirms that monetary policy is too tight. Even if the bank cannot push interest rates any lower, it can still push down the yen by, in effect, printing money. Yet the Bank of Japan has stubbornly refused to ease policy to halt the yen's rise. Its official reason is that it believes that policy is loose enough. What really holds it back, however, is that it wants to preserve its newly won independence and is therefore loth to cave in to politicians calling for monetary easing-even if they may be right. 
It may be too late for both the Fed and the Bank of Japan to escape blame. If America's stockmarket bubble bursts painfully, fickle investors, consumers and businessmen will quickly see Mr Greenspan in a rather less favourable light. Expect Congress to try to curb the Fed's powers. If the Bank of Japan continues stubbornly to refuse to ease monetary policy and thereby chokes the economy's nascent recovery, it too will face a political backlash. The problem with increased power is that you get all the blame when things go wrong. 
expected the share behaving ethically to double, to 47%. 
Such changes are thanks partly to investors. Those who want an easy conscience have plenty of choice. A survey of ""ethical"" investment in America, by Wiesenberger, a firm that tracks mutual funds, includes no fewer than 183 such funds in equities and bonds, domestic and foreign equities, small-cap and midcap, you name it. But will the investors see a decent return? The idea that virtue can be consistently more profitable than vice sounds too good to be true. Yet there is some evidence to support the claim. The Wiesenberger study, for example, found that what it calls ""socially screened funds"" had, on average, done consistently better than other funds (although they tended to be more risky and slightly more expensive). 
In the autumn of 1999 Dow Jones published a new index, the Dow Jones Sustainability Index (nasi), which it had drawn up with Sustainability Group, a Swiss firm that specialises in ethical financial services. ""Sustainability"" is defined according to a range of criteria measuring a firm's performance in economic, environmental and social terms. The index is composed of 229 firms, with a market value of $4.3 trillion, that are the 10% most sustainable companies in 68 industries across the world. 
At first sight, the strikingly good financial performance of the index is evidence that the ethical crowd are on to something. The companies in the index, which includes names such as Honeywell, Unilever, Skandia and Fujitsu, had on average produced higher shareholder returns over five years than other firms in their part of the world; on the whole, they also did better than the rest of their particular industry. 
Yet if lousy firms conclude that they can solve their problems simply by being nicer to their workers, they may be in for a shock. Which comes first, sustainability, profits or good management? Remember the old maxim that a clean factory is an efficient factory. Able managers tend to avoid waste, prevent accidents and motivate their staff, whether they are setting out to be sustainable or not. Few of the firms contained in the n,rsi satisfy the enthusiasts' call for a ""triple bottom line"" that would elevate social and environmental reporting to the status of financial reporting. 
Arguably, business ethics is as much about protection as opportunism. After damaging scandals, firms such as Nike and Mattel have felt obliged to pay closer attention to, say, working conditions in their suppliers' factories. Yet poor old Shell, which had spent a lot of money on trying to be a good corporate citizen, encountered a storm after it said it would dump the Brent Spar oil-platform in an ocean trench-even though the idea eventually proved reasonable. Similarly, Monsanto, an American firm that has shown a keen interest in the triple bottom line, is now a bogeyman in Europe because it makes genetically modified organisms. Ethical behaviour offers some insurance against public-relations disasters, but it is by no means a guarantee. 
sions, and without a bid-offer spread, will be launched in the second half of 2000. Smaller broker-dealers will find it particularly hard to cope in this new environment. They may have to slim down services, such as research, which is traditionally paid for through trading commission, in order to trim costs. Posit, a similar system, which allows institutional investors to deal with each other blindly-thus lessening the risk that the market will move away from them when they place a large order-will further develop and expand its young business. Other electronic networks, such as Island, one of the best-known American ECNS, will consider expanding into Europe. 
European exchanges will struggle to establish a viable alternative to America's NASDAQ, where Microsoft is listed, for young European high-tech companies. NASDAQ's listings of European equities have stalled since the launch of Frankfurt's Neuer Markt in March 1997. The Neuer Markt faces new competition from techMARK, the London Stock Exchange's new market for technology stocks, and reinvigorated rivalry from its four fellow euro-zone partners in Euro NM, an alliance of markets for young high-tech companies from EASDAQ, which was also set up as a direct copy of NASDAQ. 
Europe's 31 depositories will come under pressure to consolidate from Europe's banks, which are irate at being asked to pay for overlapping and incompatible systems. Smaller depositories will be encouraged to sign up for one of three models of integration on offer. Euroclear, the international bond clearing house, while it has the support of the big international banks for its ""hub and spokes"" model, will struggle to gain the co-operation of other European clearing houses, until its ties with operator J.P. Morgan are finally severed in 2002. That may give its rival, Cedel, time to make progress in its establishment of a ""European Clearing House"". London's Crest will also tie up a few more countries' clearing systems, along with Ireland's and Switzerland's, into its network. By the end of 2000, Europe will not have a single market for European equities, but the shape of the new market will become clearer. 
Goodbye to Glass-Steagall, the law that kept American 
financial services apart. Now banking-braking-insuring conglomerates will form rapidly. 
More strength to Wall Street. 
Pam Woodall: economics editor, The Economist.  1999 ""Goodness is greed."" Such would be the text of Gordon Gekko, the beastly broker from Wall Street, were he today to preach how firms should conduct themselves in 2000. Companies increasingly seem to think that being ""ethical"" will make them rich. Groups as different as Electrolux, a Swedish white-goods firm, and DuPont, an American chemicals giant, have taken to the idea that the best way to be nice to your shareholders is to be nice to your workers and your environment too. 
The ethics of self interest is not a new philosophy, but it is moving inexorably from the campaigners' den to the boardroom. Firms that once attracted the fury of non-governmental organisations (NGOS) have crossed the barricades. Rio Tinto and Placer Dome, two mining companies, are part of a consortium that is setting out to advise firms on how to provide health care for the people living around their mines. Similar guidelines are being drawn up by a body that sets standards for a group of oil companies, including Royal Dutch/Shell and BP. The World Health Organisation, under its new head, Gro Harlem Brundtland, a former prime minister of Norway, has for the first time begun to work closely with private companies. In 1999 De Beers, another mining firm, paid $2.7m to help eradicate polio in Angola. 
Such collaboration is becoming almost fashionable. A survey of 133 NGOS, published by PricewaterhouseCoopers, an accountancy firm, found that their attitudes to business are rapidly changing. NGOS currently take a dim view of multinational companies, with 41% describing relations as ""antagonistic"" and 62% believing that capitalists do not much care about ethics. But the same NGOS thought that in the future (the survey did not specify when) the share of multinational companies that want to co-operate with NGOS will increase fivefold, to 61%; they expected the share behaving ethically to double, to 47%. 
Such changes are thanks partly to investors. Those who want an easy conscience have plenty of choice. A survey of ""ethical"" investment in America, by Wiesenberger, a firm that tracks mutual funds, includes no fewer than 183 such funds in equities and bonds, domestic and foreign equities, small-cap and midcap, you name it.

Edward Carr: business editor, The Economist.  1999 Emerging markets are back on line. Net private inflows of capital into the emerging economies will total around $120 billion in 2000, a 75% increase on 1999 levels. Latin America will receive the major share, the result of having rich old Uncle Sam next door and a relatively well-established rule of law. Although flows into Asia are looking healthier, the region will suffer a net outflow as loans are repaid. A return to the 1996 inflow of $100 billion is unlikely for at least the next three years. Problems in Indonesia and China will get worse before they get better. And investors know it.  1999 In a few years' time our e-wise grandchildren will wonder how on earth a market worked without the Internet. Such is the sublime ease with which it brings buyers and sellers together, transfers information-everyone's favourite commodity-and allows you to buy and sell any time, any place, that real markets seem hopelessly clumsy in comparison. 
You may well want to disabuse these youngsters over their cyber-naivety, but when it comes to trading shares on the Internet they will definitely be on to something. The trick with equity trading is simple: the Internet allows far more people into the market, settlement can be made just by switching a few digits around in cyberspace and you can trade when you want, where you want. The Internet and share-trading are, in short, what the word synergy was invented for. 
So prediction number one: massive growth. Jupiter Communications, an IT consultancy, estimates that by 2003 online brokerages will be managing assets worth $3 trillion. That is roughly equivalent to what the top three investment banks held in 1998, a sizable slice of the international asset pie. Forrester, another IT consultancy, predicts that the number of households with online accounts will more than quadruple over the next three years from 5m in 1999. In Japan, investors will use their games consoles to trade. 
For many, the obvious winners of the current trend are the big discounters such as E*Trade (the largest Internet-only broker), Datek and Ameritrade, which stack trades high and sell them low. These are the brokers of choice for America's 5,000 day-traders. 
Yet, for all the radical new dynamics at the core of the e-brokerage business model lies an old-fashioned economic conundrum-the pay-off between price and value. Low prices are not everything-many people would prefer some advice too. That is why even after 20 years of deregulated commission rates, American discounters have cornered only 25% of the retail market. With ""free trades"" probably arriving in 2000 (paid for by those guys in advertising), revenues will undoubtedly fall. Thus prediction number two: price wars will lead to largely pyrrhic victories for a few discounters. 
In reaction, many companies will attempt to add value to lowish prices. Traditional discounters are moving upstream to become ""mid-tier"" firms. Charles Schwab and Fidelity will seek to sell advice, portfolio management and even banking services to their clients. Forrester estimates that assets managed by the mid-tiers will grow tenfold by 2003 to $1.5 trillion. 
Prediction three is cataclysmic: the end of fullservice brokering as we know it. Many analysts believe that the current 20% of all the retail trade done on the Internet will rise to 50% by 2001. And the Internet, already awash with financial information, is quickly undermining the rationale for paying high prices-$100300 per transaction compared with $15 from a discounter-for informed trades. This means pain for the full-service brokers such as Merrill Lynch over the next five years. Until now they have remained confident that the quality of their research would keep customers loyal. They also feared that by going online they would cannibalise their traditional business. Led by Prudential, many took their first steps online in 1999. Yet 2000 will be the year when they begin successfully to evolve, or have their fates sealed as financial dinosaurs. Watch them travel downstream with Internet operations, lower prices and brand-based advertising campaigns to do battle with the mid-tier firms. 
And now the bad news 
So prediction four appears obvious: cheaper prices, better information and wealthier individual investors. Only that it is not. Share prices go up and down even in cyberspace. The problem is that someone somewhere has to lose money; it does not matter whether the information you have bought is good-it has to be better than your competitors'. That might encourage you to pay a premium for top-notch research. Or, if you know about the efficient-market hypothesis, it might cause you to despair. 
The hypothesis, a basic plank of finance theory, dirties an otherwise rosy picture. It holds that you cannot beat the market since all the information available to you is already reflected in the share price. And with a thousand other online investors better informed and a few seconds quicker than you are, what hope is there of consistently making a buck? 
Research in America shows that three in every four daytraders make a loss. And that is in a bull market. Calls to provide new regulations for a newish industry will only get stronger with any future sustained market fall. Those instant-riches advertisements look naive now-with a big fall they may appear criminally irresponsible. And in America, you know what that means. 
Thus to cater for the more cautious investment generation who prefer mutual funds, the Internet will provide two key services: ease of transaction and price transparency. Internet buying of mutuals will boom. Financial planning sites will proliferate. Fund companies who present their products in the best possible statistical light will have their products compared using common standards. This transparency is a good thing and will lead, the fifth prediction, to better-value funds. A help, no doubt, in paying for educating those e-wise descendants.  1999 Europe's stock exchanges will have to fight three battles in 2000. First, their strategy to consolidate trading across borders to create one pool of liquidity will be countered by the emergence of electronic communications networks (ECNS); these will offer cheaper, and often anonymous, ways of doing business. Second, the new European markets for high-growth companies will each vie to be seen as the NASDAQ of Europe, as will NASDAQ itself. Third, Europe's clearing houses, the Cinderellas of the trading world, will fight it out to see which becomes the leader. All of this will take place against a shift towards equities across Europe as governments make clear that individuals must provide for most of their own retirement costs. 
The failure of the London Stock Exchange (LSE) and the Deutsche Borse to produce the truly unified trading platform that they promised when they unveiled an alliance in July 1998 has left a void in European trading. Paul Roy, head of equities at Merrill Lynch, an American investment bank, says the substitute proposal, to link brokerages to a number of exchanges electronically, is not enough. However, others argue that modern technology makes this the obvious shortterm solution. Bengt Ryden, head of Stockholm's stock exchange, which itself is a listed company, boycotted the eightcountry alliance headed by London and Frankfurt, preferring instead to let foreign brokerages connect electronically to Stockholm. 
Europe's exchanges will realise that their main competition is no longer from each other. New scNS will make an attractive bid for trading volume, promising what London-Frankfurt failed to deliver: a single platform for pan-European stock trading. Tradepoint, which failed to make an impression against London when first launched, looks better positioned following a refinancing which has included most of the big investment banks. True, its owners will continue to gain more from trading through traditional exchanges, but they know that their own clients, the ""buy-side"" asset managers and pension funds, may bypass them altogether if they do not move with the times. E-Crossnet, a mechanism for fund managers to buy and sell shares without having to pay broker commissions, and without a bid-offer spread, will be launched in the second half of 2000. Smaller broker-dealers will find it particularly hard to cope in this new environment. They may have to slim down services, such as research, which is traditionally paid for through trading commission, in order to trim costs. Posit, a similar system, which allows institutional investors to deal with each other blindly-thus lessening the risk that the market will move away from them when they place a large order-will further develop and expand its young business. Other electronic networks, such as Island, one of the best-known American sots, will consider expanding into Europe. 
European exchanges will struggle to establish a viable alternative to America's NASDAQ, where Microsoft is listed, for young European high-tech companies. NASDAQ's listings of European equities have stalled since the launch of Frankfurt's Neuer Markt in March 1997. The Neuer Markt faces new competition from techniK, the London Stock Exchange's new market for technology stocks, and reinvigorated rivalry from its four fellow euro-zone partners in Euro NM, an alliance of markets for young high-tech companies from EASDAQ, which was also set up as a direct copy of NASDAQ. 
Europe's 31 depositories will come under pressure to consolidate from Europe's banks, which are irate at being asked to pay for overlapping and incompatible systems. Smaller depositories will be encouraged to sign up for one of three models of integration on offer. Euroclear, the international bond clearing house, while it has the support of the big international banks for its ""hub and spokes"" model, will struggle to gain the co-operation of other European clearing houses, until its ties with operator J.P. Morgan are finally severed in 2002. That may give its rival, Cedel, time to make progress in its establishment of a ""European Clearing House"". London's Crest will also tie up a few more countries' clearing systems, along with Ireland's and Switzerland's, into its network. By the end of 2000, Europe will not have a single market for European equities, but the shape of the new market will become clearer. 
Margaret Doyle: financial correspondent, The Economist.  1999 Will the dramatic expansion of global stockmarket capitalisation from $9.3 trillion in 1990 to about $25 trillion hold? As a result of the bull market on Wall Street, the United States now accounts for about half the world's stockmarket capitalisation compared with only about 30% in 1990. Japan, by contrast, has shrunk from 40% to only about 11%, its lowest share since the early 1950s. The growth of America's stockmarket capitalisation has played a decisive role in powering the growth of both consumer spending and capital investment. But with stockmarket capitalisation at 150% of cDr compared with an average of 49% over the previous 60 years, there is a risk that a correction will have a more depressing impact on domestic spending than previous bear markets. This inflation of asset values-and the knock-on effect that a correction of, say, 25% would have on the real economy-will be Alan Greenspan's greatest single preoccupation in 2000. 
The driving force in the expansion of the American equity market has been the spectacular performance of the technology sector. It has expanded to a market capitalisation of over $2.7 trillion. It now accounts for about a quarter of America's overall stockmarket capitalisation compared with 10% in 1990. The changing composition of the equity market reflects the fact that information technology now accounts for about 20% of American capital stock compared with 18% in Britain, 14% in Sweden, 11% in Germany and 8% in Japan. The leader in this process has been Microsoft, which enjoys a market capitalisation of some $500 billion. If Microsoft can sustain the growth performance of 1998 and early 1999 for another year, it will soon qualify to join the Group of Seven rich countries by boasting a market capitalisation larger than Canada's GDr. But whereas technology has boomed, the value of traditional sectors such as mining and heavy industry has slumped. In mid1999, the total market capitalisation of the global metals industry, including steel mills, gold mines, copper mines and other mineral companies, was only about $320 billion, or just over 60% of the market capitalisation of Microsoft. Watch for the ability of high-tech stocks to deliver profits in 2000. But note how this huge change will likewise change society in the years ahead. Nowhere will change more in 2000 than Japan. In the modern era, Japan has had a system of stakeholder capitalism in which profits played a less decisive role in corporate decision-making than concerns about sales, asset size and employment. The result is that Japanese firms have a return on equity of only 2%, compared with 20% in the United States and 15% in Western Europe. But the collapse of profitability has triggered a stockmarket decline which is setting the stage for a revolution in the relationship between management and shareholders. As a result of depressed equity-market returns, Japanese firms have an unfunded pension Liability of 80 trillion ($730 billion). They will probably correct it by injecting into the pension pot a large share of the corporate crossshareholdings, which have been the financial counterpart of stakeholder capitalism. When this adjustment occurs, Japan will have a powerful constituency demanding that firms focus more attention on profitability for the first time in its modern history. Ironically, the ageing of Japanese society will compel the private sector to introduce a more dynamic form of capitalism in order to satisfy the income needs of the growing population of retired people. 
Look for dramatic change in Europe. Take Germany's rapidly growing marketplace, called the Neuer Markt, with over 125 small technology companies and an aggregate market capitalisation of about $40 billion. Software companies account for 22% of the market while Internet service providers and other Internet companies make up another 20%. The rise of the new market represents the most dramatic breakthrough in the development of a popular equity culture in Germany since the second world war. This is not just a new market, it is a new mind-set. It bodes well for Frankfurt and ill for the City of London. Indeed, whereas the German stockmarket once experienced trading pauses on Jewish holidays, volume now slumps when student holidays occur. 
2000 will see large chunks of the world with new-and much improvedbanking systems. Latin America has opened up its financial system to foreign investment so much that over half of all bank assets now belong to foreigncontrolled institutions. Argentina has gone the furthest because its use of a currency board means that its central bank can no longer be the lender of last resort. And as a result of the ownership changes since 1995, Argentina's banks now depend upon lenders of last resort in London, Madrid, Hong Kong and Washington, not just Buenos Aires. Due to the recent financial crisis, Asia is also opening up to foreign investment in the financial system. In another 12 months, foreign institutions will probably control at least 40% of the banking systems of Thailand, South Korea and Indonesia compared with nothing five years ago. In Eastern Europe the story is the same. German, Dutch, Irish and Austrian banks now control over half of all bank assets in Poland, and in Hungary foreigners have almost a 90% market share. Estonia, another currency-board country, has sold about 80% of its banking system to the Swedes. Future banking crises will be lesser, more controllable, phenomena as a result. 
Will emerging markets upset the apple cart? Their stockmarket capitalisation declined by several hundred million dollars during 1998 after expanding from $488 billion to $2.2 trillion between 1988 and 1996. The developing countries' share of global stockmarket capitalisation is now only 8% compared with 14% in 1996. But the contraction has created the potential for a tremendous catch-up. After all, these same countries will account for 45% of world output, 70% of the world's land area, 85% of the world's population and 99% of the projected growth in the global labour force during the early decades of the 21st century. 
Popular share ownership has grown dramatically in many countries as a result of the 1990s stockmarket boom. The United States mutual-funds industry now has assets larger than the banking system. It is estimated that 45% of Americans are in the market either directly or through mutual funds, compared with 5% in the 1950s. Australia now has more shareholders than trade-union members. The collapse of interest rates which resulted from monetary union in Europe has also encouraged a dramatic growth of the mutual-fund sector in countries such as Italy and Spain. During 1998 Italian mutual funds attracted over 35 billion ($37 billion) of retail-savings flows while Spain's mutual funds received nearly 10 billion. Many developing countries are introducing pension funds in order to promote wider share ownership and help finance privatisation of state enterprises. Singapore began the process during the 1960s. Chile went further during the 1980s. Today, there are several Latin American countries with pension funds which have an aggregate market value of over $150 billion. When the cold war ended, there were probably only 100m people on the planet who owned a share or had a pension plan. By 2000 there will be over one billion shareholders in both the industrial and developing countries. The resultant change in world politics is palpable-and wholly for the good. 
China is now so anxious to stimulate consumer spending that its government has begun to talk up the stockmarket. There were editorials in the People's Daily during the summer of 1999 calling upon investors to buy equities. The government is liberalising its rules for bank lending to brokerage firms. Officials also say that private firms, not just former state enterprises, will be able to list on the market. But policy will have to remain supportive of the market for some time if rising equity prices are to buoy the economy. China's market capitalisation is only about 25% of GDP there are only 35m shareholders. 
The growth of retail-share ownership has not reduced the role of institutional investors in the market. In the case of the United States, the expansion of mutual funds to $6 billion of assets has increased the power of large institutions. Firms with more than $100m under management now control equities worth about 51% of America's market capitalisation, compared with 27.6% in 1980. The result of this increasing concentration in market share has been to produce an institutional bias in favour of large companies, which has caused them significantly to outperform smaller companies during the 1990s. This is an unhealthy development. Watch for the start of a correction in 2000. 
The new role of stockmarkets as storehouses of personal wealth and engines of capital formation suggests that they will play a far more important role in the formulation of public policy than ever before. Governments everywhere are being compelled to give their citizens more options for their retirement savings than just government debt. Central banks are increasingly being forced to make judgments about equity markets when determining whether monetary policy should be adjusted. 
There is little doubt, for example, that the Federal Reserve would welcome a modest stockmarket correction in the United States in order to slow the growth rate of domestic consumption. Every January, the Wall Street Journal conducts a survey of United States forecasters to find out their predictions for the year ahead. Since 1994, the consensus has been a projection of only 2.3% output growth compared with an actual outcome of 3.5% a year. 
The task confronting the Federal Reserve in 2000 is to engineer a soft landing in which equity prices do not fall too far. The challenge is unique because the United States has a huge currentaccount deficit. America's households have been on a buying spree that has kept the rest of the world from recession. But this deficit has been financed only by foreigners buying American equity. If the stockmarket were to fall sharply, there is a risk that the dollar could also collapse, with destabilising consequences for bond prices and all financial assets. As a result, both the United States economy and the global economy are now more dependent upon the performance of the New York equity market than at any other time in history. 
David Hale: chief investment analyst, Zurich Financial Services, Chicago.  1999 After a run of several thousand years, it is entirely fitting that 2000 will be marked as the year the tide turned against taxation. Clay tablets recall the taxes of Hammurabi in the Babylon of 2000BC, but the practice is certainly older. People in power have always tried to divert some of the proceeds of economic activity in their own direction. Lords took feudal dues from their vassals; landowners took tolls from merchants; gangsters took protection money from small businesses; governments took taxes from their citizens. Despite the different names, the principle has remained constant: those who do not produce take resources from those who do, and spend it on altogether different things. 
The tide is turning because of the convergence of several factors. In the first place, taxes are becoming harder to collect. Capital is more mobile than ever, and inclined to fly from places that tax to places that do not. Governments do not move their boundaries and jurisdictions as rapidly as companies can change locations. Attempts to establish trans-national tax powers are almost certainly doomed by international competition to attract economic activity. Many businesses will choose to stay out of reach. 
The global economy and the Internet mean that purchases can now cross frontiers. People buy books, clothes and cars from abroad, and any finance minister who likes to tax these items finds his tax base diminishing. It is not only capital and goods which are harder to pin down. Even wages are crossing frontiers. The rise of the service sector means that many income-generating activities can take place across frontiers, causing yet more headaches for overstretched public treasuries. Furthermore, the pace of electronic, hard-to-trace activity is accelerating. 
No less important has been the rise of political resistance. The past quarter century has been marked by a movement led in Britain and America towards tax limitation. It announced itself in California's famous tax-cutting referendum Proposition 13, but saw its fullest expression in the Thatcher and Reagan tax cuts of the 1980s. Britain's Tories entered office in 1979 with the top rate of income tax at 98%, and left office 18 years later with a top rate of 40%. Indeed, their Labour opponents became electable only after a firm promise not to raise it again. In the United States, George W Bush would not make his father's mistake of increasing taxes despite a ""read my lips"" pledge. The plain fact is that electorates these days will not stand for it. They recognise, correctly, that governments spend their money less carefully and less efficiently than they can spend it themselves. 
One of the greatest uses of tax money is to provide pensions. And here a revolution-as important and pervasive as privatisation-is sweeping the world. Fully funded personal pension plans, based on an individual's savings, are sweeping away the poorly funded public pensions promised by governments. The latter take taxes from the young to support the old. The former invest savings from the young to support themselves when old. 
A lead all will follow 
Singapore blazed the trail in the 1950s with individual provident accounts, but it was when Chile pioneered the replacement of state pensions with private funds in 1981 that the world took notice. Their lead set a pattern which has increasingly been followed in South America and, more recently, Poland. Britain itself has largely converted to private 
personal funds, whose total value, well in excess of $1 trillion, exceeds that of all of its EU partners combined. Britain's vestigial state pensions are of ever-diminishing significance. 
Tax-transfer schemes are vulnerable to demographic changes. If the numbers of old people increase, if they require support for more years, or if the numbers in work decrease, the adverse balance can impose unacceptable tax burdens on the young. Belgium, France, Italy and Germany most of all, have yet to face the tax consequences of their profligate promissory notes. Their expensive attempts to do so will provide one of the main economic dramas of the next decade. It is also the case that funded pensions give better value. The fund grows with the economy, aiding it in turn with investment, and achieving better returns than can be relied on from governments. 
Taxes are thus being squeezed from three directions: the increased mobility brought by globalisation, electoral resistance to taxation, and a movement away from tax-funded schemes. All of this will make life difficult for finance ministers. The solution in Britain has been to opt for ""stealth"" taxes which do not show, but few suppose this will be more than a temporary expedient. A more permanent solution will be for finance ministers to recognise their limitations and for governments to live within their means. Money-laundering becomes easy in Brazil with the arrival of 250m plastic banknotes in April.  1999 Uncle Sam's commercial domination is only in its infant stage, asserts Martin Sorrell, chief executive of WPP, an advertising giant. 
Theodore Levitt may have got it wrong. In 1983 he wrote an article in the Harvard Business Review saying that we were all going to market global products and services in the same way everywhere. Twenty years on, the thesis seems wrong in one particular respect: there is not a global way of marketing, rather there is an American way. America's business methods have become the world's. 
If you are going to run or develop a business of global significance, domination of the American market is critical. In almost every category of industry or services, the real winners will be those companies that have strong franchises rooted in the United States. In advertising and marketing services, for example, approximately 45% of the expenditure in this $1 trillion industry originates in the United States. About two-- thirds of this expenditure is controlled or, to be more politically correct, is ""influenced"" from there. 
The same is true of many other industries, particularly for those companies that seek to share information efficiently around the world. Chief executives may devolve power to regional or brand-based business units, but they also want to ensure that wheels are not being needlessly reinvented in international organisations. The controls they put in place are usually rooted in America. 
This economic power and the relative homogeneity of the American market are being exploited ruthlessly as American corporations push their products and services around the world. Thus there is not a global standard, in the Levitt sense, but an American one. It is a standard driven by the need to hit financial targets demanded by shareholders. 
If you tell the Street or the City that you intend to increase your profits or earnings per share or return on capital, by 5% to 15% a year, you can do it only by taking share from a competitor or expanding globally. Expansion is probably easier and more profitable. 
But a decision to expand internationally faces every chief executive with three problems. And the answer to each of these reinforces the conclusion that to be global it is necessary to be American. 
The first is brand. To gain marketshare companies need to brand products ever more strongly; and many of the most powerful brands, of course, are American. 
The second is the web, which threatens to shake up every product and service without exception. The web may be global but its culture and driving force is American. 
The third is the need that every business has to communicate its strategic changes internally as well as externally; if the people within the organisation don't understand policy, then external communication will obviously suffer. This internal communication often follows, or reinforces, an American mind-set. 
If you thought this trend was welldeveloped, just reflect on the fact that the average American-based multinational still derives only 20% of its sales or profits from outside the United States. The average corporation is more like Pepsi-Cola, which still has 80% of its business inside the United States, rather than Coca-Cola, which has 80% outside. So there is still a long way to go. 
If all this were not enough, the dominant position of a strong American market is being reinforced by a strong capital market. Despite a narrowing recently, stockmarket valuations on the American side of the Atlantic are still generally higher. In almost every category this gives American-quoted companies a lower cost of equity capital and hence a lower average cost of capital. As a result, stronger organic growth is being reinforced by stronger growth through acquisitions. Again, this trend will have a long way to go in 2000 and beyond. European-only mergers do not solve the problem. They are purely defensive. If Deutsche Telekom and Telecom Italia had been brought together, what would this have done in the United States, the largest telecoms market in the world? Nothing. 
Similarly, what does the marriage of Carrefour and Promodes do offensively? Defensively, it may be a way of dealing with the arrival in Europe of America's Wal-Mart, the world's largest retailer, but for it to succeed it must exploit the advantages afforded it in Latin America and China. 
Europe isn't global 
A more cohesive European market will risk encouraging European-based multinationals to focus too much on Europe and too little on the United States and beyond. Despite a market of 350m people, 100m greater than the United States, Europe's union lacks the homogeneity of the American market. 
What is the answer? The development of global businesses which are rooted in the strongest and most vibrant market in the world-the United States. You only have to review the car industry, any packaged-goods sector, the computer industry, the new technologies and web companies, high-tech and telecommunications, entertainment, media, and health care. Nor is this confined to making things. It also applies to services. Look at the consultancy industry, investment or commercial banking. 
There are companies that understand. sr Amoco and Vodafone lead the way in the United Kingdom. Vivendi leads the French invasion of the United States as does DaimlerChrysler from Germany. Telefonica looks like it will do the same from Spain although it is focusing on Latin America initially. 
The only reason for caution is that we were talking about Japan in the same terms only a decade ago, and look where Japan is now. Trends such as these can go the other way. Historically, they usually do so. Economic and political domination by one state does not usually last long. 
Reading on paper is so much a part of our lives that it is hard to imagine anything could ever replace inky marks on shredded trees. Since Johannes Gutenberg invented an economical way to make movable metal type in the 15th century, making it possible to produce reading matter quickly, comparatively cheaply and in large quantities, the printed word has proved amazingly resilient. So how could anyone believe that sales of electronic books will equal those of paper books within a decade or so? 
First, it is worth remembering that paper is only the latest in a long line 
of reading ""technologies"" that were made obsolete each time an improved solution emerged. Pictures drawn on rock gave way to clay tablets with cuneiform characters pressed into the clay before it dried. Clay gave way to animal skin scrolls marked with text, and then to papyrus scrolls. By 100An the codex had arrived, but it was not until the ninth century that the first real paper book was produced. In Europe, paper was rare until after Gutenberg's breakthrough. 
It took a few more centuries for ebooks to emerge. They were first envisioned in 1945 by Vannevar Bush, director of the United States Office of Scientific Research and Development. In his classic essay, ""As We May Think"", Bush described a gadget he called a ""memex""=`a device in which an individual stores all his books, records, and communications... Most of the memex contents are purchased on microfilm ready for insertion. Books of all sorts, pictures, current periodicals, newspapers, are thus obtained and dropped into place... Wholly new forms of encyclopedias will appear, ready-made with a mesh of associative trails running through them..."" 
Although science-fiction writers eagerly adopted Bush's ideas-notably on the television show ""Star Trek"", where portable electronic books featured regularly-the real world has remained loyal to paper. Only in the encyclopedia market, which was transformed by CD-ROMS in the mid-1980s, has the e-book made real progress. Far more encyclopedias, from Microsoft's Encarta to Encyclopedia Britannica, are sold on cn-ROM than were ever sold on paper, because they cost a fraction of the price and are easier to search. But attempts to broaden the appeal of e-book technology to ""ludic"" (or pleasure) readers have been unsuccessful. Since the late 1980s the electronic publishing world has seen several failed e-book ventures. 
Why? Most of them used devices that were either too bulky to carry around, or forced users to ""stock up"" their electronic library in inconvenient ways. (One required visits to a ""book bank"", an ATM-- like machine that was to be located in bookstores.) Before widespread adoption of the Internet, there was no universal way to download new reading material. But the most fundamental problem was the lack of a display technology that could compete with paper when it came to ludic reading. 
For paper books, readability depends on many factors: typeface and size, line length and spacing, page and margin size, and the colour of print and paper. But for e-books there are even more factors, including resolution, flicker, luminance, contrast and glare. Most typefaces were not designed for screens and, thanks to a limited number of pixels, are just fuzzy reproductions of the originals. The result is that reading onscreen is hard on the eyes and takes a lot more effort. People do it only for short documents. The longer the read, the more irritating and distracting are all the faults in display, layout and rendering. 
Most of these problems are now being solved. The World Wide Web offers an amazingly flexible way to deliver books in bits-and as investments in broadband infrastructure increase, it will get even easier to stock an e-library. And dozens of companies-including e-book pioneers and established publishing firms such as R.R. Donnelly, Penguin Putnam, Nokia, Barnes & Noble and Microsoft-have joined to create an open e-book standard, so that book-lovers will be able to read any title on any e-book. 
There have also been some incredible technological breakthroughs that will make it much easier to read long texts on a screen. Microsoft has developed a font display technology called ClearType that, by manipulating the red, green and blue sub-pixels that make up the pixels on an Lcn screen, improves resolution by up to a factor of three. Coupled with the latest e-book reading software and hardware, this provides an on-screen reading experience that begins to rival paper. 
But why would anyone prefer an e-- book to a p-book, regardless of improved readability? Because e-books have many other advantages. You will get instant delivery from your web bookshop to your e-book, and be able to store hundreds of novels on a device the size of a paperback. E-book technology enables you to have an entire library in your pocket. Or you can keep it on your PC-a modern laptop can hold more than 30,000 books. You won't have to wait for out-of-stock books to be ordered, and books will never go out of ""print"". Your children will be able to listen to unfamiliar words pronounced for them as they read. You will have unabridged audio synchronised to the text, so you can continue the story in situations where you are unable to read-for example, while driving. 
In addition, e-books promise to revolutionise the way the world reads. Whereas paper books are stand-alone entities, e-books can include hypertext links to additional content, whether it is in other books, databases or web sites. So e-books will not be restricted to a linear structure that is the same for everyone-every reader will be free to make use of the links, images and sounds dif ferently. You will also be able to customise e-books by adding your own notes, links and images. In a paper book, content is fixed; with e-book technology it is flexible. Finally, you will be able to get sound and moving images to support the text, creating an entirely new multimedium. 
The e-book will also revolutionise the economics of the industry. The cost of publishing books will fall dramatically, the result of savings on materials, labour, manufacturing and distribution. In the process, a lot of trees will also be saved and even the most obscure author will be able to self-publish, which means more choice for readers. The retail price of books will fall; sales will explode. 
It is hard to imagine today, but one of the greatest contributions of e-books may eventually be in improving literacy and education in less-developed countries. Today people in poor countries cannot afford to buy books and rarely have access to a library. But in a few years, as the cost of hardware continues to decline, it will be possible to set up ""virtual"" public libraries which will have access to the same content as the Library of Congress.

the dinosaurs. Do humans have a 
similar fate? NASA's Near Earth Asteroid Rendezvous spacecraft will start orbiting Asteroid ""433 Eros"", the first of our efforts to know the enemy.  1999 European corporate finance is mid-way through a vast change. The past few years have brought what seemed like a wave of Americanisation. In fact, it was a trickle. The tidal wave arrives in 2000. In the coming years, Europe's biggest companies will swap their equity for debt, changing the whole profile of European finance. 
As with much else in modern economics, the root cause is disinflation. Over the past 30 inflationary years, investors have been interested in little besides equity, because dividends, being variable, can be adapted to rising prices. But equity is risky. Holders are the last to benefit in the event of a liquidation. It is a post-tax cost. It is therefore an expensive form of finance. Debt, by contrast, is less risky and a fixed, pre-tax cost. So the supply of equity is drying up. Companies are either taking themselves off the stockmarket or buying in their equity. 
What about demand? The demographic bulge created by the baby boom after the second world war has generally had a prosperous and satisfying life. It is now approaching the age of retirement. If you wanted to swap a lump sum in savings for a regular cash income, how would you do it? 
The stockmarket? Lucent Technologies, a key supplier of hardware to the Internet and a darling of the stockmarket, produced a capital return of nearly 80% in the 12 months to September 1999. That's a sweet profit. But Lucent's yield-the amount it returns in dividend income per dollar investedis currently a tenth of a cent in the dollar, 0.1%. Microsoft, an even better known success story, yields nothing. 
These cases are exceptional, of course. But they illustrate the lie of markets as a whole. The average British equity yields 2.5%. In the United States it is 1.3% and in Japan 0.7%. Moreover, average equity yields are falling. High-yield stocks are the ones switching to debt. In the United Kingdom in 1999, with few exceptions, new equity was issued exclusively by low-yield, highly valued, new technology companies, the Lucents and Microsofts of the future. 
What about government bonds? They still carry a yield and in many leading markets they are near enough to riskfree. True, but with the end of inflation government yields are increasingly reflecting that lack of risk. The difference in yield between a three-month American dollar deposit and a 30-year Treasury bond is scarcely more than one percentage point. In the United Kingdom, the yield on a 30-year government bond is, crazily, 0.5% lower than the interest rate on a three-month deposit. Meanwhile, a 30-year Japanese government bond currently yields 2.7% in total. 
Over the medium to longer term the yield on government stock is likely to continue to decline. This is because the supply is drying up. With the Republican bill to cut taxes having run into the presidential veto, it seems all but certain that the federal surplus that is currently accumulating in the United States will be used to pay down public debt. More important, the word on the campaign trail is that this is what voters want. The resuit will be a reduction in the Treasury market of nearly a third over the next ten years. Excepting Japan, a similar story can be told of most other rich countries, even including Italy. 
Compare the following. A bond issued by the Halifax, a British mortgage lender, paying interest at 9.4% and with 21 years to run, now yields 6.3%. This is 1.3 percentage points higher than the equivalent government bond and three percentage points above the Halifax's own dividend yield. The Halifax has a double-A credit rating, not much below that of a government. Rupert Murdoch's BSkyB, with a triple-B rating, yields 8.1% on its ten-year bondnearly three percentage points more than the equivalent government bond and 7.6 points above BSkyB's dividend yield. 
The spreads in the United States are equally attractive. A ten-year bond issued by Ford yields 7.3%, compared with less than 6% for the comparable Treasury. A 20-year bond issued by Sprint, a successful telephone company with a credit rating equivalent to BSkyB, yields 9.3%, against the 6% current yield on the 30-year Treasury. But buy Sprint's equity on the stockmarket and you will only get a dividend of about 1%. 
In the first nine months of 1999 some $30 billion went out of the British equity market by way of share buybacks, while about $45 billion was raised in new capital through issues of sterling corporate bonds. This is but a pointer for 2000. The figures for the United States are in similar proportion, but it is in Europe as a whole that there is the potential for enormous growth. Corporate gearing in the United States is above 60%, three-quarters of which is obtained through the bond markets. In Europe, gearing is below 30%, with less than a third of debt sourced through the bond markets. So expect changes in 2000. Less equity. More debt.  1999 Reading on paper is so much a part of our lives that it is hard to imagine anything could ever replace inky marks on shredded trees.

Bill Gates: chairman of Microsoft.  1999 If you take the game of life seriously, if you take your nervous system seriously, if you take your sense organs seriously, then, over the course of this coming year, you must turn on, tune in and drop out. And buy up too, if you are one of millions of patients now heeding Timothy Leary's advice and turning to complementary medicine. Over two-fifths of Americans will use some sort of unconventional therapy, according to David Eisenberg, at Boston's Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Centre. Almost half of all Germans and perhaps a third of Britons will also try acupuncture, chiropracty, herbal remedies or some other complementary treatment for relief. 
Leary, who knew a thing or two about drugs, would have been pleased. So too are the growing ranks of complementary practitioners and firms producing dietary supplements and herbal compounds. Dr Eisenberg's surveys estimate that Americans paid 629m visits to complementary therapists in 1997, a 46% increase since 1990 and almost two-thirds more consultations than mainstream primary care doctors performed. Americans will spend some $30 billion on complementary treatments, much of it out of their own pockets. In Britain, France and Germany, there will be a similar boom. 
This hardly surprises William Haskell of Stanford University's Complementary and Alternative Medicine Research Programme. Although the popularity of complementary treatments differs from country to country (the French, for example, are keener on homeopathy than Americans, who favour chiropracty), their general success is driven by much the same forces. Patients are increasingly frustrated with the limitations of mainstream, western medicine to deal with their complaints. Conventional medicine is only starting to come to grips with ill-defined chronic ailments, such as memory loss, and lifestyle complaints, among them impotence, which will increasingly plague the world's ageing population. 
Much of complementary medicine, however, from spinal alignment to traditional Chinese herbs, is pitched at just these long-term imbalances; users see them not only as a means of relieving disease in the sick, but of promoting health in the worried well. As America's private medical providers, the health maintenance organisations, try to live up to their name and reduce their costs, Dr Haskell believes they will start to include complementary medicine in their basic coverage, further enhancing its popularity. Although fiscal pressures are forcing some countries, such as France, to question the state's subsidy of complementary therapies, consumer demand is likely to increase government reimbursement in the coming years. 
Of course, the appeal of complementary medicine lies not only in the counter-culture, but in the over-thecounter-culture as well. Many patients, better informed about health and keen for a greater say in their medical treatment, choose complementary therapies precisely because they have the freedom to do so without prescription. In America, almost half of all complementary medicine is do-it-yourself care. When patients do visit a complementary practitioner, many find the interaction far more rewarding than a trip to the general practitioner. Since much of complementary medicine focuses on broad holistic factors, such as diet or emotional state, consultations are usually longer and wider-ranging than a busy primary care physician can afford. 
Western medicine, however, is very nimble in adopting tricks from other disciplines and from different cultures. In America, mainstream multinational prescription-drug companies, such as American Home Products and Bayer, have launched brands of herbal supplements to take advantage of the $2.6 billion market, which is expected to more than double by 2003. Almost two-thirds of American medical schools now teach courses in complementary medicine and older practising physicians, while perhaps not embracing complementary medicine, at least no longer dismiss it. Even in China where traditional and western medical practice have existed side-by-side for years, Dr Eisenberg notes growing moves among practitioners to combine the best elements of both. Indeed, where once complementary medicine was known as ""alternative"" (or worse), watch for the spread of ""integrative"" medical clinics in the coming year. 
Science will drive many complementary therapies into mainstream clinical practice, and others into the bin. At the moment, there are few authoritative clinical trials or laboratory tests to assess the claims of such treatments. That is set to change as a number of large clinical trials, co-ordinated by America's National Centre for Complementary and Alternative Medicine, take place in 2000. They will establish whether, say, St John's Wort is better at relieving mild depression than Prozac or if shark's cartilage is any good for lung cancer. 
Such proof will come in handy as complementary remedies confront the regulators. Unlike conventional drugs, dietary supplements can be sold in America without prior approval from the federal Food and Drug Administration, which strikes many critics as an unsound, unsafe arrangement. 
Some firms, among them Britain's Phytopharm, are trying to rescue herbal mixtures from the hinterland of dietary supplements and establish them as a new class of drug with full regulatory approval. As the ancient Chinese proverb says, ""Real gold is not afraid of the hottest fire."" In 2000, complementary medicine will have to prove its mettle. 
Britain's University for Industry begins full operations. It will run a nationwide network of 1,000 learning centres. 
Shereen El Feki: health care correspondent, The Economist.  1999 And you thought there was only one Internet? Internet2 (I2) is an American university-led venture, which is being used to create the Internet infrastructure of the future. In 2000, campus networks will gain access to a vastly improved form of multicasting and the revolutionary Quality of Service (Qos). What is more, companies will soon begin to enjoy the fruits of these high-tech endeavours. 
The 12 network is named ""Abilene"", after the railhead that opened America's west. It is based on a new protocol, IPv6-you currently use IPv4-and currently wires up 150 universities. This protocol has massive capacity, is super-reliable and is much, much faster than today's congested info-highway. Abilene can transfer data at 2.4 gigabits a second, 45,000 times faster than a typical modem; imagine ten encyclopedias sent around the world in less than a second. 
Multicast technology allows the same packet of information to be sent to multiple locations. It is already used by 3,000 radio stations, which multicast their audio over the Internet. The magic of IPv6 is that it guarantees image and audio transmission without delay, jerkiness or the odd frame getting lost. It opens the way for web-based television. 
IPv6 also lifts the curtain on Qos. This solves an important part of the net congestion problem by guaranteeing reliable broadband width. Crucially, traffic can be prioritised and delivered almost instantly. Abilene may also soon be transmitting holographic images and its creators are working on a sense of touch. 
In 2000, multicasting will be rolled out on to the campus for further testing. Of course, keeping America's big corporations off the systeman Internet purist's dream-is impossible, not least because they are partially funding the experiment. AT&T, Microsoft, isM, Cisco, MCI WorldCom/Sprint and others are contributing around $50m to the project in the hope that they can use the technology in building company intranets. This will ensure America's decisive lead in Internet technology for another decade.  1999 The first ""working draft"" of the human genome-the digital recipe of our genes -is scheduled to be published early in 2000. It represents a critical milestone in the mammoth international project to decode the entire genetic sequence of man. It will also mark the beginning of a new era in personalised medicine in which a patient's genetic make-up is used to predict and treat illnesses with drugs tailor-made for an individual's inherited predispositions. 
Competing organisations are racing to be the first to sequence and decipher the three billion letters that make up the complete genetic code of human DNA. On one side is the combined might of the American government and the Wellcome Trust, the world's largest medical research charity, which are stumping up most of the $3 billion being spent on the Human Genome Project. On the other is a small, select band of privateers who, with highly specialised equipment and computers, are able to carry out ""fast and dirty"" decoding, which they hope to protect with patents and so reap vast sums from pharmaceutical companies that will need the data for the development of new drugs and medicines. 
One such private operation is run by Craig Venter, a maverick scientist who became disillusioned with the official genome project and so established his own operation with the help of venture capital. His company, Celera Genomics, and its sister operation, the Institute of Genomic Research, in Rockville, Maryland, are the most serious competitors to the publicly funded sequencing project. 
Dr Venter has pioneered a quick method of decoding the genome that was famously derided by James Watson-the co-discoverer of the nrra helix and founding father of the Human Genome Project-as work that ""any monkey"" could do. Celera, however, has already sequenced the entire genetic code of several micro-organisms and has promised a full sequence of the human genome by 2001, two years ahead of the final completion date fixed by the Human Genome Project. In order to recoup the investment in the vast number-crunching operation, Dr Venter intends to charge a fee for organisations to access his genetic database of DNA sequences. 
However, in a deft move aimed at undermining the threat posed by Dr Venter and others, the Human Genome Project has established a consortium which over the next couple of years will throw enormous effort into finding the crucial bits of the human genome that are set to become vital elements of the medicine of the 21st century. The Wellcome Trust is spearheading the consortium along with four of America's most prestigious genetics centres- the Whitehead Institute for Biomedical Research, Washington University School of Medicine, Stanford Human Genome Center and the Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory. The backers that will finance the project's initial $45m include the leading pharmaceutical businesses. 
The main goal of the consortium is to find the genetic signposts of disease and to publish them on the Internet as soon as they are decoded, thereby preventing others like Dr Venter from patenting the same information. These particular signposts are known as single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPS, pronounced ""snips""). They represent the smallest change possible in a gene and as such the genetic difference between one person and another is in effect the result of the differences in their stirs. For every 1,000 ""letters"" in the code of a human gene, there is typically one stir. This means that two unrelated people have, very roughly, a million stirs to distinguish between them. 
SNPS are the ultimate genetic landmarks and will enable scientists to navigate the vast open spaces of the human genome. They are the fine-grained physical features that enable the genetic mapmakers to locate their precise position and, in doing so, to decide whether that particular region of human DNa is medically useful or important. 
SNPS have the advantage of being highly stable. They don't change from one generation to another like some other genetic markers. They are evenly and frequently spaced through the genome (a prerequisite of any good signpost), and they are simple (representing the smallest form of genetic change possible). The consortium believes that building up a map of sNPs will be at the heart of personalised medicine, shifting the focus of treatment from what works best for the majority to what works best for each individual, based on their unique genetic inheritance. 
Conventional genetic tests are used on disorders caused by defects in single genes-such as cystic fibrosis or Huntington's disease. New tests based on patterns of stirs will enable doctors to estimate a person's predispositions to a range of other disorders, from asthma and cancer to diabetes and senile dementia, where a number of predisposition genes are thought to be influential. If heart disease tends to run in your family, there should be a set of SNPS that could be used to estimate your risk of heart attack. 
Another, more intriguing, function of an SNP map is in the design, development and use of new drugs. It is well established that some people, for no apparent reason but probably related to their genes, suffer serious side-effects to drugs. sNPS might prove useful in helping to identify those people who will respond best to a certain drug. The new science of pharmacogenomics should make drug prescription less of a hit-or-miss affair. It opens the way for doctors to prescribe more tailor-made medicines that recognise our unique genetic individuality. 
Research under way promises a revolution in medicine. The race between the competitors should, by the end of 2000, decide who picks up the glittering prizes. 
Steve Connor: science editor of The Independent.  1999 Astronomers are currently enjoying a construction boom. The white and silver domes of new telescopes have been popping up like giant mushrooms on otherwise barren mountain-tops in Hawaii and Chile. Many of these will open for business in 2000, causing astronomers' productivity to rise sharply. In the southern hemisphere, in particular, the new observatories will increase the amount of light that astronomers can study by a factor of five. 
It might seem ill-advised, then, to predict that the most surprising (and therefore important) advances in astronomy in 2000 will not be made by studying light. Nevertheless, it is a safe bet. The headline discoveries will belong to those astronomers who study light's shorter-wavelength cousins: x-rays. 
This is not to belittle the new Hawaiian and Chilean telescopes-they are huge. The bigger a telescope's mirror, the dimmer the objects it can see. Each of the new observatories has a primary mirror eight metres in diameter. This makes the previous generation of four-- metre telescopes look puny. 
They are also equipped with the very latest stargazing gadgetry, including the ability to deform their mirrors under computer control, to cancel the blurring and twinkling effects of the atmosphere. This combination of bigness and sharpness makes the new 8-metre class wellsuited to study the remotest objects visible from Earth-the universe's oldest galaxies. By revealing the differences between these ancient galaxies and present-day ones, the new telescopes will help astronomers learn how galaxies change over billions of years, and how galaxies were formed in the first place. 
Impressive as that may be, the new machines are simply bigger and more numerous versions of instruments that already exist. They do not even break any size records-the twin Keck telescopes already sitting on Mauna Kea in Hawaii each measure 10 metres across. 
The real surprises in 2000 will come from celestial x-rays, since two new xray telescopes are about to enter terrain that is almost completely unexplored. An x-ray telescope must be perched in space, rather than on an arid mountaintop, because the atmosphere does not merely blur x-rays; it devours them. This is lucky for humans, who would otherwise be zapped by the sun's x-rays, but it means that x-ray astronomy lags behind that of ordinary light. Each x-ray mission is risky and expensive, but potentially very significant. 
The Chandra X-ray Observatory was launched in July 1999 into a high, lazy orbit taking it one-third of the way to the Moon and back. Throughout 2000 (and for five or ten years more) it will be taking x-ray pictures of the universe with unprecedented clarity. In that sense, Chandra is the x-ray equivalent of the Hubble Space Telescope (and also in the sense that it was paid for by NASA, America's space agency, to the tune of $1.4 billion). Not to be outdone, in early 2000 the European Space Agency will launch the X-ray Multi-Mirror (xMM) telescope, which will have even bigger mirrors than Chandra. 
Many different things in the universe emit x-rays, but they all share one common attribute: they are outrageously hot. Well past red-hot and blue-hot, to be x-- hot requires a temperature of tens or hundreds of millions of degrees. X-rays are produced, for example, when a particularly large star runs out of fuel and explodes. Or, if a black hole is close enough to a star to suck away the star's outer layers, the ripped material gets hot enough to emit x-rays. In short, x-rays mark the spots of celestial violence. 
Chandra and XMM will provide much sharper images of all these phenomena. What appear presently to be nebulous blobs of emission might turn out to contain filaments or spots that will reveal what is really going on. 
Joshua Winn: doctoral student in astronomy at hnr.  1999 Global warming will preoccupy the next generation, predicts Sir John Houghton, of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. 
One hundred years ago Claude Monet painted scenes of London through its smoggy atmosphere. That was local pollution. What is relatively new and more worrying is global pollution-that is pollution emitted by people locally that has global effects. The first example to emerge was damage to the earth's ozone layer. International action was promptly taken through the Montreal Protocol to phase out the use of the chemicals responsible. Although full recovery of the ozone layer will now happen, it will take at least a century. 
Another example is pollution that leads to global warming and climate change. Carbon dioxide and other ""greenhouse"" gases such as methane are released into the atmosphere through the burning of fossil fuels (coal, oil and gas) and also through deforestation. These gases absorb ""heat"" radiation emitted by the earth's surface that would otherwise be lost to space, so maintaining the surface and the lower atmosphere at a warmer level than normal. 
The amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere has already increased by over 30% since 1750 and, if no action is taken to stem the increase, it will reach double its preindustrial value during the second half of the 21st century. As a result, the average rate of warming of the climate is expected to be greater than at any time during the past 10,000 years. This is not of itself necessarily bad; some communities will experience a net benefit. But many ecosystems as well as humans will find it difficult, if not impossible, to adapt. 
Although there is a lot of uncertainty concerning the detail, the basic science underlying global warming and climate change is well understood. It is not in question. Hundreds of scientists from over 50 countries have contributed as authors or reviewers to the assessments of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (trcc). Because of the uncertainties it is easy either to exaggerate the possible impacts to calamitous proportions or to suggest that too little is known to justify any action. What the iPCC has done is explain clearly what is known together with the major uncertainties. Then, taking account of all relevant scientific data, best estimates have been provided of climate change and its impact over the next century. Here are a few of the ipcc's main findings and an outline of the agenda for the years ahead. 
First, largely because of the thermal expansion of ocean water and the accelerated melting of glaciers, sea levels are likely to rise by approximately half a metre by 2100. Therefore, sea defences in many coastal regions will need to be improved, albeit at considerable cost. However, adaptation is just not possible for countries with large river deltas such as Bangladesh, Southern China and Egypt, and for many island states in the Pacific. 
A second major result of global warming will be, on average, a more intense hydrological cycle leading to impacts on water distribution and availability. In many areas heavy rainfall will tend to become heavier while some semi-arid areas will receive less rainfall. There will be more frequent and more intense floods or droughts, especially in sub-tropical areas. Since, in many places, water is rapidly becoming a critical resource and since floods and droughts are the natural disasters that already cause most deaths, misery and economic damage, these could represent the most damaging impacts of global warming. When combined with the rise in sea levels, a recent study has estimated that this could lead to 150m environmental refugees by 2050. 
Three widely accepted principles will govern the international agreements needed to meet this threat. The first is the ""Precautionary Principle"", already clearly imbedded in the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change agreed at the Earth Summit in Rio in 1992. This states that the existence of uncertainty should not preclude the taking of appropriate action. The reason for such action is simply stated as the stabilisation of the concentrations of greenhouse gases (such as carbon dioxide) in the atmosphere in ways that allow also for necessary economic development. The second principle is the ""Polluter Pays Principle"", which implies the imposition of measures such as carbon taxes or carbon trading arrangements. The third is the ""Principle of Equity (both Intergenerational and International)"" which is the most difficult to apply. However, a proposal of the Global Commons Institute that is being widely discussed applies the second and third principles by allowing eventually for the allocation of carbon emissions to nations on an equal per capita basis while also allowing for emissions trading. 
The action agreed at Kyoto in 1997 is a first step. Necessary post-Kyoto action, however, will be more demanding. The rate of increase of global emissions must first be substantially slowed; then there must be reductions in these emissions to well below 1990 levels before the end of the next century. Many of the required technologies to bring about these reductions are already available, but they require adequate resources for investment and development. Studies show that the necessary action may cost around 1% of the total world product, much less than the likely cost of damage and adaptation if there is no action. 
If human communities are to be fulfilled and creative, they not only need goals related to their economic performance but also moral and spiritual goals. Care for the overall health of the planet is such a goal. It demands action by scientists to provide better information about likely climate change, by governments to set the necessary frameworks for change, by business and industry to seize the opportunities for innovation and the introduction of new technologies, and by all world citizens to support the action being taken and contribute to it.  1999 President Clinton was impeached by the House of Representatives on two counts-perjury before a grand jury and obstruction ol justice-arising from his concealment of his affair with Monica Lewinsky. Yet the public continued to support the president: in November's elections, his party, the Democrats, gained House seats midway through a Democratic term for the first time since the 1930s. 
Governor George Bush of Texas won thunderous reelection to position himself for the Republican nomination for president in 2ooo. The worst natural disaster in modern history hit Central America when Hurricane Mitch swept through the region, killing thousands and shattering the economies of Nicaragua, Honduras and Guatemala. 
General Augusto Pinochet, Chile's ex-dictator, was arrested in London at the request of a Spanish magistrate, who is seeking to put him on trial for murder, torture and genocide. The general's arrest made legal history, dividing Chileans and provoking protests from their government. 
In Brazil, President Fernando Henrique Cardoso comfortably won a second term in an election in October despite, or because of, a financial crisis which threatened to undermine the country's new-found price and currency stability. Six years after staging a bloody but failed military coup in Venezuela, Hugo Chavez won his country's presidency through the ballot box, on a populist platform. The separatist Parti Quebecois retained power in provincial elections in Quebec But a lower share of the vote reduced the prospects of a third referendum on independence. 
Bloody street riots caused Indonesia's President Suharto to step down after 32 years. He was replaced by his protege, BJ. Habibie; unrest soon returned. 
A veteran opposition leader, Kim Dae Jung, became president of South Korea and freed 2,300 prisoners. Malaysia's prime minister, Mahathir Mohamad, sacked his deputy, Anwar Ibrahim, and had him tried for corruption and sexual crimes. Mr Anwar claimed it was all a conspiracy. 
A Hindu-nationalist party, the BJP, formed a new government in India. Soon after, both India and Pakistan conducted nuclear tests and tension in Kashmir grew. John Howard was re-elected in Australia with a mandate to introduce a new goodsand-services tax. 
Pol Pot, leader of the Khmers Rouges, died in Cambodia. Devastating floods in China, Bangladesh and South Korea displaced millions. A tidal wave in Papua New Guinea killed 2,ooo people. 
Little change 
After an i8-month IsraeliPalestinian impasse, Bill Clinton stage-managed an interim deal between Binyamin Netanyahu and Yasser Arafat at an American summit in October. Mr Clinton then visited Mr Arafat in Gaza. But opposition to the deal in Israel's cabinet led Mr Netanyahu to decide on an early election next May. 
Two crises between Iraq and the UN arms inspectors were resolved just ahead of American bombing raids. A third one, in December, was not, and the Americans and British carried out a four-day air attack. Saddam Hussein said the inspectors would not be allowed back. 
Congolese rebels, backed by Uganda and Rwanda, set out from eastern Congo to overthrow Laurent Kabila. Angola, Zimbabwe and Namibia sent troops to protect the president. Peace efforts failed and the war became a stalemate. 
The American embassies in Nairobi and Dar es Salaam were bombed, killing 250 people, nearly all African. America blamed Osama bin Laden, a Saudi dissident, and bombed his camps in Afghanistan and a pharmaceuticals factory in Sudan. 
Sani Abacha, Nigeria's military dictator, died of a heart attack. His successor, Abdulsalam Abubakar, released political prisoners and announced elections next February at which new political parties would compete. 
Leftward bent 
By the end of 1998 left-ofcentre parties were in power, usually in coalitions, in 13 out of the European Union's 15 countries. Right-of-centre governments ruled the roost only in Spain and Ireland. 
In Germany Helmut Kohl and his Christian Democrats were beaten in a general election by Gerhard Schroder and the Social Democrats, who formed a coalition government with the Greens. 
Politics and the economy in Russia became ever more chaotic. An ailing Boris Yeltsin sacked two prime ministers and said he would stay as president until mid-2000. Voters north and south of the Irish border approved an agreement intended to bring peace to Northern Ireland But rows continued. 
A fragile peace survived in Bosnia, but its people continued to vote for leaders along largely ethnic lines. Civil war broke out in the south Serbian province of Kosovo, where the ethnic-AIbanian majority demanded independence. 
The Greek-Cypriot government of Cyprus decided not to deploy Russian surface-toair missiles, which Turkey had threatened to blitz. The Basque separatist guerrilla group ETA declared peace in Spain.  1999 To the brink 
Global GDP growth fell by half to less than 2% and the world teetered on the edge of the worst financial crisis since the 193os. Russia defaulted on its domestic debts in August; Long-Term Capital Management, a big hedge fund, nearly collapsed. Fears of a global credit crunch were eased only after America's Federal Reserve cut interest rates three times. 
Deflation surfaced. In dollar terms, commodity and oil prices sank to levels not seen since 1986. In real terms, The Economist industrials commodity price index fell to its lowest since the 193os and oil prices to their lowest in 25 years. Even the prices of finished goods fell in several countries, squeezing the average inflation rate in the G7 economies to a 4o-year low. 
As international capital flows dried up, the emerging economies submerged. Much of East Asia plunged into deep recession; Russia's economy imploded; and, by the end of the year, Brazil's economy was shrinking, after $30 billion had been spent defending its currency. Such was the demand for financial rescues that the IMF almost ran out of money; but at the last minute America's Congress approved new funds. 
Japan's economy went from bad to dreadful. By October, it had contracted for four quarters in a row, despite umpteen fiscal-stimulus packages. The Nikkei average tumbled to 12,880 in October, its lowest level for 13 years. 
Most of the other rich economies flourished. America's economy expanded by an estimated 3.5%, driven by falling import prices and rampant consumer spending on the back of stockmarket gains. Wall Street plunged by 20% during the summer, but it then recovered, to leave the Dow up 17% over the year. 
Asian banks wobbled. In Japan, the passage of a Y60 trillion ($500 billion) bank-aid package allowed the government to nationalise LongTerm Credit Bank and Nippon Credit Bank, two of the duffest lenders. The two insolvent banks had assets equal to 7% of Japan's GDP. In China GITIC, a big investment group, collapsed. 
The urge to merge 
It was the world's biggest ever year for mergers and acquisitions: they surpassed $2.4 trillion, 50% above 1997's total. American companies made two-thirds of the deals. Biggest of all in value terms was the union of two oil giants, Exxon and Mobil, announced in December: it will create the world's biggest company in revenue terms. 
About a quarter of deals by volume were cross-border. Daimler-Benz, a German car maker, joined Chrysler in the largest foreign takeover of an American firm. In drugs, parts of the biggest French and German firms, RhonePoulenc and Hoechst, merged; as did Britain's Zeneca with Sweden's Astra. 
Big banks got even bigger. Citicorp joined Travelers in the largest ever financial-services merger. A week later came news of another whopper: the merger of BankAmerica and NationsBank to form America's second biggest bank. Germany's Deutsche Bank paid $io billion for Bankers Trust, America's ninth biggest, which had been driven into loss by the emerging-markets crisis. 
In the digital world, convergence continued Compaq, a hungry Pc-maker, gobbled Digital Equipment Corporation; and America Online, the best-known Internet service provider, paid $4.2 billion for Netscape, populariser of the web-browser. In telecoms, WorldCom merged with MCI, a long-distance company. A re-energised AT&T bought TCI, America's leading cable operator, and linked with Britain's BT. 
Media mergers went transatlantic. Canada's Seagram, which owns Universal Studios, bought PolyGram, Philips's music-and-films arm, for $10.6 billion. In doing so it destroyed the nearest thing Europe had to a film studio. Bertelsmann, Germany's media giant, bought Random House for a rumoured $1.5 billion, thus becoming the world's largest Englishlanguage publisher. 
Europe came closer to having a single stockmarket when the Frankfurt and London stock exchanges decided to trade jointly Europe's top blue-chip shares. Other European exchanges said they were keen to join. 
Sic transit 
Robert Crandall, tough boss of American Airlines for three decades, stepped down. Alex Trotman, boss of Ford (and now a lord), quit earlier than expected. So did Anna Murdoch, who left her husband Rupert and the board of News Corp. 
Pfizer launched Viagra, a cure for impotence, but later had to attach a warning about side-effects. Gillette launched a sharp new razor, but later had to cut jobs. America's tobacco companies fought suits from state governments in court, but then settled their legal rows and took large charges. 
America's Department of Justice launched an epic antitrust case against Microsoft. Whatever the verdict, an appeal is certain, and the case is doubtless destined for the Supreme Court. 
Switzerland's two largest banks, UBs and Credit Suisse, buckled under a mounting pile of class-action suits and agreed to pay Holocaust survivon $1.25 billion. 
Hong Kong and Malaysia opened new airports, among the world's largest, just as the region's economic crisis cut back air travel. Both suffered expensive teething troubles.  1999 The Economist, 25 St James's Street, London swi iec FAx : 0171 839 2968 E-MAIL : [email protected] 
No apology necessary 
SIR-I have never been able to accept what many Japanese opinion makers never tire of telling us to do: to ""apologise"" to the Chinese for ""crimes"" our fathers and grandfathers committed in China (""Japan in the right"", December 5th). Conveniently they forget to tell us that China's communist leadership far outdid the Japanese imperial army in the killing of their people. They did so to stay in power and, in my view, would not hesitate to do so again. 
Also, they do not discuss how the present Japanese army, just 150,000 strong, could become an aggressive threat to our neighhours, China included. Your point that the Chinese leadership, by seeming outraged at the non-apology of Japan's leaders, is putting Japan on the defensive and extracting a financial concession is clear to see. But again, our opinion makers seem not to see such a simple truth. 
Osaka NAOMI HAGA 
SIR-I disagree strongly with your support of Japan in its refusal to apologise to China for colonial atrocities. Your main argument is that China's rulers are a nasty bunch with no right to lecture anyone about abusing the Chinese people. In some cases it can be hard to separate attitudes towards a government from feelings about the people it represents. But surely this is not such a case. The issue pre-dates the governments and indeed governmental systems of both countries, and is one on which the Chinese leaders do speak for many of their people. 
Japan does recognise and deal with the Chinese regime, in no way regarding it as a pariah state incapable of normal relations. So if we say the Chinese get no apology because we dislike their leaders, we might as well say no one anywhere gets recognition of past wrongs unless we like their government. 
Cambridge CHRIS BAMFORD 
Family values 
SIR-Your article on the sale of Icelandic family data (December 5th) clearly summarises the ethical problems. However, some matters need clarifying. Iceland is not inbred: inbreeding occurs when individuals preferentially marry known relatives. The effect is to lose genes, especially rare ones. This makes the remaining genes easier to find but it has little effect on common genes, whose collaborative efforts influence the risk of common disorders. Rather than its depth of ancestral documentation, the value of Iceland in these disorders is that its environment is unusually homogeneous, as are standards of living and standards of medical provision. 
In relatively rare disorders due to single genes, such as cystic fibrosis and the inherited form of breast cancer, deep ancestral studies allow a single common ancestor to be found and the position of genes to be defined through nearby genes. In common disorders many genes are usually involved and these genes may be derived from as many ancestors. 
It is difficult to see how defining more ancestors can provide much information on the common disorders whose decipherment is the main commercial attraction. It was largely the impossibility of making pedigrees both confidential and informative that led the Ethical Committee of the Icelandic Medical Council to state that it was ""completely opposed to the present bill and will advise Icelandic physicians not to participate in the setting up of the data base.""

SIR-Bagehot (December 5th) states that Salvador Allende was murdered. It is a well known fact, even recognised by Chile's left, that Allende committed suicide. 
Santiago RAUL WARD 
In the pipeline 
SIR-Your article on Caspian energy (November 28th) asserts that prospects for building a main export pipeline from Baku to Ceyhan in Turkey have rarely looked so doubtful. In fact, prospects for this project have never looked better. 
In the past, many observers thought a pipeline between Baku and Supsa in Georgia could provide the optimal route for exports from offshore Azerbaijan. But during the past 12 months, companies and regional governments have realised the importance of some broader considerations. These include long-term energy security, the viability of shipping large volumes of oil through the Bosporus, and the attractiveness of a large-diameter pipeline to a port like Ceyhan, which is able to handle exports from both sides of the Caspian. 
The contention that the bulk of output from eastern Caspian producers will flow to a Russian terminal on the Black Sea may be true, but only for a limited time. Significant potential exists for boosting the proven oil reserves of Kazakhstan, both offshore and onshore. If fully realised, these additions could exceed the capacity of the Caspian Pipeline Consortium's first- and secondphase pipelines to the Russian Black Sea coast. 
In early December, Kazakhstan and three companiesChevron, Mobil and Shellagreed to study the feasibility of creating a unified system of oil and gas pipelines from western Kazakhstan to Turkey. This will be an important step towards aggregating Caspian output and enhancing the viability of the Ceyhan export route. The Azerbaijan International Operating Company, meanwhile, has said negotiations are continuing with potential transit countries. These developments, plus the likelihood of incentives from regional governments, will ultimately make Baku-Ceyhan the optimal route for Caspian oil exports.

Case for the defence 
SIR-Your special on defence (December 12th) confuses cause and effect. You say that ""the chances of aerial dogfights or naval battles"" are declining and, therefore, large industrial war machines such as ships, submarines and tanks are not worth purchasing. But why are the chances of mechanised land wars, dogfights and sea battles receding? Is it because of a fundamental change in the nature of warfare or because the overwhelming superiority of western militaries makes confrontation impractical? 
It is arguable that there is overinvestment in traditional areas but equally arguable that it is crucial to maintain an overwhelming advantage in these areas, to deter the most destructive forms of warfare. The situation is analogous to the maintenance of a nuclear deterrent to make nuclear attack uneconomical. Tacoma

The Economist, Ill West 57th Street, New York, NY 10019-2211.  1999 WITH every day that passes, matters get worse. The country is drifting along in a state of neglect. Legislative programmes are unheard of. Reformist debate has stopped. The political atmosphere is as poisonous as it has been since the 196os. Iraq is bombed, and half America-as well as much of the worldwonders at the president's motives. When Russia collapses, when markets stumble, when China gets aggressive, when the next terrorist atrocity occurs, the world still hopes America will take the lead. But how can it, when Bill Clinton is about to go on trial before the Senate? 
Everyone wants this horror-and horror is not too strong a word-to end. Had Mr Clinton resigned in August, when he was forced to admit that he had lied to his family, his colleagues and the American people, he could have finished it there. He could still do so; and would do so, if he were capable of shame or had any sense of honour. But Mr Clinton is even less inclined to resign today than he was before his impeachment. The vote to impeach was so partisan that it has rallied even wavering Democrats behind him, and has hitched the polls a few points higher in his favour. Where even the intimation of impeachment shattered Nixon, it has strengthened Bill Clinton. He will cling on to the last. 
How then can the paralysis be broken? At this point, only in two ways. The first would be a quick trial in the Senate which would probably end in acquittal but would not rule out criminal proceedings once Mr Clinton had left office. The second would be a motion of censure: constitutionally doubtful, but not objectionable, as long as it did not include immunity from future prosecution. Two things are vital here. The first is speed, to get America back to work. But more important is the second: that the president should be made to face the consequences of his perjury before the grand jury. He must be made to feel the weight of the damage he has done. 
Penance all round 
To be fair, blame for the damage should also be laid at other doors. America has been so convulsed by this scandal, and the public so revolted, because the process of bringing Mr Clinton to book has been tainted at every stage. The president was dogged by an independent counsel whose powers were excessive and whose tactics were sometimes suspect. The Supreme Court caused much of the paralysis by ruling that the Paula Jones suit against a sitting president should proceed. That suit itself was encouraged by the president's political enemies. The press-including The Economist-leapt into the Monica story with both feet. As a result, although the machinery of impeachment was gleefully cranked up, it soon felt wrong. The sense of shame and sadness that now engulfs many thoughtful Americans comes not so much from sympathy with this particular president-whose lying defiance deserves noneas from worry at the precedents that have been set for political vendettas against elected presidents in future. 
As the newyear dawns, there is some hope that the damage done will not be lasting. In the Senate, at least, there is a desperate urge for civility to undo the grandstanding rudeness shown by Republicans in the House. If the Senate performs its duties with dispatch, and above all with bipartisanship, some of the wounds may start to heal; though it may take months, and even a trouncing in next year's elections, before the Republican zealots in Congress start to grasp the havoc they have caused. 
On a point of detail (though a large one) Congress should review, and consider abolishing in its present form, the office of the independent counsel when the statute comes up for renewal this year. At present, an attorney-general has little choice but to appoint such a counsel when there seems to be evidence of executive-branch wrongdoing. But his brief is open-ended, his funding and his subpoena powers almost limitless. The present statute, a reaction against the powerless prosecutors of the Watergate era, did not envisage a Ken Starr figure let loose on the White House. The office has diminished the importance of Congress (as was seen most clearly in Watergate) in checking the excesses of the president and his men. 
The Supreme Court, too, has not emerged without bruising. As soon as a pretext arises (though America might well hope one would not arise soon), the court should revisit its ruling that sitting presidents are liable to prosecution in civil suits. The justices, like the House Republicans in turn, have sometimes seemed blustered into hardline positions by their distaste for the president's stonewalling. If calmer tempers can prevail, the three main branches of government may be able to deal with each other reasonably again. 
Yet that may take years. Although every arm of government, not merely the president, has behaved in ways they are now beginning to regret, dangerous precedents have been set. The presidency is a weakened and unattractive office, impeachment has become a purely partisan instrument, and marginal groups in Congress will now feel they have the power to overturn the mandate of the people. It is high time everyone drew back, reviewed the damage, and began to restore some of the rules and conventions that have kept America free of such traumas in the past. But the first essential is the brisk, fair and appropriate punishment of the man who, many months ago, might have spared his country all this agony by behaving as an honourable president really should.  1999 Historians may well count January 4th 1999 as an epic moment 
IT WILL happen over a holiday weekend, and in a way which leaves ordinary citizens more or less unaffected, as new notes and coins will not replace old national currencies for a further three years. But the nature of its launch on January 4th should not let anyone underestimate the importance of the creation of the euro, the new single currency for ii European Union members, nor miss its genuinely historic nature. It is the biggest risk the Eu has ever taken, but also an adventure that could transform the economic and political landscape of the continent. It is the first time that countries of anything like this number, size or global economic weight have gathered together to share a currency, and thus to pool their monetary sovereignty. It is arguably the most momentous currency innovation since the establishment of the United States dollar in 1792. 
The superlatives could go on. But is the euro to be welcomed? Yes, it is, and all should hope that it will be a success. The European Union is an imperfect creature, with some of its actions based on fine principles of political economy and some on poor ones. The intentions behind the euro fall clearly into the first category. The EU was founded in 1957 on the desire to avoid war, and many of its best achievements have also been based on another sort of disarmament: policy disarmament. For external trade, for state aids, for the singlemarket rules and others, countries have handed over powers that seemed (though generally weren't) individually desirable but were in practice mutually harmful. A similar transfer is happening now with monetary policy. The ii euro members' rights to inflate, to finance budget deficits by printing money, to boost exports temporarily by currency devaluation are being handed over to the new European Central Bank (ECB) in the most powerful way possible, by treaty. 
As with the other forms of policy disarmament, the transfer of powers to a supra-national body does not guarantee they will be used well. In trade, national protectionism has too often merely been replaced by pan-European protectionism. But the Treaty of Maastricht, which in 1991 paved the way for the ECB and the euro, gives cause for hope. The ECB has a strict and simple task: price stability. It is forbidden by treaty from bailing out a profligate government. Its independence from political interference is well entrenched. 
That said, the risks associated with the euro also begin with the treaty. To paraphrase Keynes's criticisms of the Treaty of Versailles after the first world war, treaties often solve one problem but cause the next. In the case of Maastricht, one risk is that the ECB's task will be carried out too strictly and inflexibly. But the most worrying legacy lies in the treaty's strictures about national budget deficits and in the cementing of those concerns in the later Stability and Growth Pact. As our article argues on pages 19-zz, this deprives governments of the one power which, under a monetary union, they most need: the ability to use national fiscal policy to counteract recessions which affect one member state more than the others. They have not lost this ability altogether, but it will be severely constrained. 
The danger that this raises is that in the event of a sharp recession in one or more countries, there will then be a political reaction against the EU itself The Union as a whole, and other euro members, will be blamed for the victim's inability to moderate its recession. Given that public support for the euro has been thin, to say the least, in most of the member countries (and is unlikely to grow much during the absurdly long, three-year period before people actually get hold of euro notes and coin), this is one helluva hostage to fortune. 
A United States of Europe? 
Such an outcome, if it happens, could cause a political bustup; or it could lead to more power being transferred to the EU in the worst possible circumstances, namely when the Union is deeply unpopular. But there is also a happier way to think about things. Perhaps this nasty outcome will not occur, either because no such ""asymmetric"" recession takes place or because governments, meanwhile, have dismantled the stability pact. In that event, the euro will have proved a success: its members will have achieved low inflation, and the currency will have ridden out the ups and downs of the economic cycle without itself becoming politically unpopular. That is the outcome for which everyone should be hoping during the next decade. 
What then? The answer, most probably, is that a successful euro would give a big impulse to political union between the constituent countries, something close to the founding fathers'-and Winston Churchill's-original dream. The policy disarmament of monetary union would have been shown to have worked, would by then be justifiably popular, and would have encouraged governments to seek new ways to transfer their powers to common institutions. Such a union is not inevitable. And on a decade or two's timetable it would be unlikely to be as full a union as today's United States of America. To those who hate federalism, the very thought of political unity will anyway be anathema. But this would be the right way to arrive at a closer union: after a positive experience, and with popular support. 
Even this Elysian vision must, however, take account of other likely changes. By then the EU will be bigger, with 20-3o members rather than the current 15. That fact, let alone the current division between the ii euro countries and the four, led by Britain, that have not joined, is likely to mean that the Union should become a multi-system entity, with some countries signing up to everything and others opting for a different blend. It may well prove perfectly rational, in the long term, for some EU countries to stay out of even a successful euro. But that, too, is a happy thought: a Europe that is broad as well as deep, that takes account of national differences and is not thought of as a federalising bully. If the euro succeeds in creating such a Europe, its launch on January 4th 1999 will be looked back on as really quite a moment.  1999 Not even Tony Blair can put a positive gloss on the scandal that has just claimed two of his senior ministers 
TONY BLAIR is one of the world's most admired politicians. In Britain, too, his personal popularity has remained unusually high well into the second year of his New Labour administration. But even Mr Blair will find it difficult to emerge unscathed from the scandal that led over Christmas to the abrupt resignation from the cabinet of Peter Mandelson, one of his closest political friends, along with the resignation of Geoffrey Robinson, the paymaster general, who had secretly lent Mr Mandelson 373,ooo ($630,ooo) on easy terms to buy a swanky home in London's Notting Hill. Mr Blair seems genuinely to have been kept in ignorance of this arrangement between his friends. But he has connived in letting Mr Mandelson make light of what he did. 
A letter of resignation is often the last chance politicians have to put a favourable spin on an unfavourable turn of events. If their careers are finished, it does no great harm to let them get away with it. But Mr Blair has told Mr Mandelson that his career is far from over, that he will achieve ""much, much more with us"". To drive the message home, the undisgraced former minister has been consoled by an overnight stay with the Blairs at Chequers. He is to retain various special responsibilities, such as strengthening Britain's relations with Germany. In short, his career is still very much alive. That is why he and Mr Blair cannot be allowed to get away with a truly breathtaking bit of resignation spin. 
To judge by his letter to Mr Blair, Mr Mandelson is a victim of fate, a loyal lieutenant who did nothing seriously wrong in borrowing some money from a friend, but who would sooner fall on his sword than allow the faintest hint of impropriety to taint the high ethical standards which supposedly sets New Labour apart from its Tory predecessor (see page 49). Tojudge byhis letter to Mr Mandelson, Mr Blair sees his former trade and industry secretary as a loyal chum who made a ""misjudgment"" but insisted on doing the honourable thing, paid a heavy price, and so forth. This is not just the usual humbug politicians are expected to spoon out when they get into this sort of fix. It is hypocritical nonsense. 
Far from being a willing martyr, sacrificing a glittering career for a higher cause, Mr Mandelson resigned only after the failure of an energetic attempt to brazen things out, and in the light of further disclosures that he may have been economical with the truth when applying for a mortgage. Above all, it is nonsense to portray Mr Robinson's loan as if it were only something that might look wrong to suspicious minds. It really was wrong-which is why Mr Mandelson strove so hard to keep it secret. 
Consider the sequence of events. Mr Robinson made the loan, on favourable terms, when Labour was in opposition and Mr Mandelson was at the centre of Mr Blair's inner circle. In these circumstances, Mr Mandelson must surely have wondered whether Mr Robinson's generosity was an attempt to buy position in the new government. And yet he said nothing about the loan to Mr Blair. He said nothing after the election, either, when he was made responsible for presenting government policy and Mr Robinson was made paymaster general. He said nothing when Mr Robinson's business affairs later became the stuff of controversy and the subject of scrutiny by Parliament. And, amazingly, he continued to say nothing when, as trade and industry secretary, his own department started an investigation into Mr Robinson's affairs. Not at all holier than thou 
Many people will look at this affair and wonder whether Mr Mandelson's belief that the pursuit of greatness requires a flashy house will set back the modernisers in the Labour Party. That is another story (see Bagehot, page 52). What is already clear is that the party that entered office promising to set higher standards in public life has let itself off far too lightly. Mr Mandelson pretends to see nothing wrong in failing to tell Mr Blair about his personal indebtedness to the beleaguered Mr Robinson. Mr Blair pretends to believe him. As for Mr Robinson himself, Mr Blair says that a blameless minister has been ""hounded out"". But if Mr Robinson is blameless, why did Mr Blair let him go? And if Mr Mandelson had to go, why is he promised a glittering future? It is almost enough to make you nostalgic for John Major.  1999 Taking part, it is said, is just as important as winning. This rule apparently applies as much to economic statistics as to sports 
WHEN a country competes for the first time in the Olympic games or the World Cup, it unleashes a wave of national pride-even if its athletes come last. A less well known mark of national esteem is whether a country is included in The Economists economic indicator pages (see pages 88-90). Our power to delete countries at the mere click of a mouse can, it seems, provoke international disputes. 
Disgruntled government officials and businessmen often demand to know why their country is left out. The answer is simple. New Zealand's economic policies have been more exciting (and more commendable) than Belgium's, but (given our space constraint) the criterion for inclusion in our pages on developed countries is size: Belgium may be uneventful, but its GDP is almost four times that of New Zealand's. 
Some governments wince if their country is listed among the emerging economies. Portuguese officials were cross to see their country in our emerging-markets table. Their yelps, and the fact that Portugal is now part of Europe's single-currency area, persuaded us to move it into the developed world. The unfortunate result is that Portugal has now completely disappeared from our tables. ""Why?"" demands the country's foreign minister. Because although Portugal was important in the emerging-market league (its stockmarket is relatively developed) its economy is too small to include in our league of developed countries for which we publish much more detailed economic statistics. 
Let that be a warning to Greece, which also claims that it is no longer an emerging economy. Better, perhaps, to be a big fish in a pond than a tiddler in an ocean. In the real world, promotion can sometimes lead to an even more serious fate. The IMF promoted South Korea, Hong Kong, Singapore and Taiwan from developing to advanced economy status in May 1997-only months before East Asia's financial collapse. 
Behind such disputes lies a deeper issue: the labels given to countries are out-of-date. So ""industrial economies"" are misnamed now that industrial production accounts for only one-quarter of their output-much less than in the emerging economies. And the ""emerging market"" label-itself created to provide a more positive image for the ""third world""-also looks tarnished. It once conjured up the image of dynamic economies and stockmarkets; now, with countries from Thailand, to Russia, to Brazil in deep recession, cynics have renamed them ""submerging"" markets. 
Name dropping 
Four years ago, The Economist suggested a new set of labels for country groupings: the ""paralysed"" (poor economies, such as those in Africa, that have been standing still); the ""progressing"" (emerging markets); and the ""paranoid"" (the rich countries that are terrified of competition from the progressives). But since then many progressives have become paralysed, and some, such as Malaysia, risk becoming paranoid too as they shelter their economies from global forces. 
Perhaps we should group countries according to their chances of gaining entry to our indicator pages: the puny (too small, no hope) the persistent (governments which pen the most letters of complaints and the persuasive (those with good arguments, of course, not frenetic phrases). But the only sure winners will be the patient: economies that expand by following sound policies.  1999 Only poets can now save mankind from millennium buggery 
SCARCELY a year to go, and still no one can be confident that the stroke of midnight next December 31st will not release a plague of little green bugs to usher in the new millennium. Panic is rising. Every household in Britain has been told to stock up with two weeks' supplies, presumably of spam, margarine and vindaloo curry, the national dish. Some people foresee the lights going out all over the world, as power stations crash. Others say aircraft will go demented, along with cars, trains, traffic lights, hospital equipment and the numberless other bits of high-techery that make modern life worth living (all those computer games of Christmas past). Launch-on-warning missiles will be released, nuclear weapons will start spontaneously to fizz and, if any life at all continues, stockmarkets will go into sullen decline, as a bug-induced recession of apocalyptic proportions takes hold. 
Admittedly, the bugs are not going to have it all their own way. A working-group of ""informatics"" experts, known as Y2K chiefs, has just been convened at the United Nations in New York. They have been instructed to ""address the difficulties, and facilitate a useful exchange of experiences."" 
Reassured? Of course not. It is nerds and geeks and informatics experts who got us into this fix in the first place. With the clock ticking, it is no good looking to them to get us out of it. Bring on the people who really get things done-""the trumpets which sing to battle and feel not what they inspire . . . the unacknowledged legislators of the world."" Yes, Shelley's poets are now the only ones likely to be able to make the world safe for computerised civilisation as we know it. 
And how? Well, by stopping the ticking of the damned clock. Smart-Alicks have come up with their silly ideas, such as telling your computer or microchip that 2ooo is really 1972, the most recent year to have matching dates and days of the week. If it worked, that would buy 28 years in which to solve the problem, or at least address the difficulties, and facilitate a useful exchange of experiences. An alternative would be to say, ""All right, computers, listen up: the calendar has been wrong from the start. Jesus Christ was actually born around 6Bc, so we've really passed the dreaded 2ooo mark and you didn't even notice. It wasn't so bad after all."" Or you could do a Pope Gregory, or at least a variation of his trick, which was to skip the ten days after October 4th 1582 in order to tidy up the Julian calendar, which had been losing a day a century. But whether you go forward or back, you meet this difficulty: why should computers respond any more readily to being fooled about the date than to being told the truth? 
So over to the poets, those unacknowledged legislators of the world and, of course, to those they write about: 
Your face would stop a clock, For it's so passing fair That time itself would like to stop And linger there. 
Forget other proposals, the stopped clock is the only solution to the millennium-bug problem. A pause will do everybody good: the world has been in a dreadful rush for far too long, and in many respects people are really getting ahead of themselves. Properly equipped, the poets can avert something that might be quite unpleasant. Only one thing is missing: the face they need to arrest the ticking. Let the search begin. The world has just 12 months (no little green gremlins need apply.)  1999 Europe's monetary union is neither bound to succeed nor doomed to fail. Leadership, circumstances and luck will combine to decide its fate 
THE architects of the euro, looking back this weekend on what they have achieved, are entitled to feel pleased with themselves. As recently as ten years ago, the idea of merging the European Union's national monetary systems seemed fantastic. A plan for doing it was drawn up nonetheless. Then, with the ink on this blueprint hardly dry, the forerunner of the single currency (the exchange-rate mechanism of the European Monetary System) collapsed, casting new doubt on the whole enterprise. No matter. The prime movers, Helmut Kohl in Germany and Francois Mitterrand in France, carried on regardless. On January 4th their remarkable vision becomes a reality: the currencies of the it participating members of Europe's Economic and Monetary Union will be ""irrevocably"" fused. 
To have come this far is in itself an amazing political feat. Nobody can claim that EMU was forced upon Europe's governments by force of events, still less by popular demand. Events have, if anything, conspired to wreck the plan. Europe's voters, perhaps reflecting the weight of official pro-euro propaganda, are by and large in favour, and opinion has moved further in this direction of late (see table i) However, the balance in Germany, which could prove decisive, is still quite narrow. And it is disturbing that so few voters anywhere consider themselves ""well-informed"" about the project. 
This is an initiative of extraordinary ambition, given that it is to be carried through despite quite shallow support in popular opinion. EMU is an elite project. Europe's governments are saying: Our people may not be convinced of the euro's benefits just yet, but once it is in place and they come to understand it, they will change their minds. Europe's leaders had better be right. Otherwise, when the system comes under strain, its political foundations may prove too weak to sustain it. 
Even before construction of the euro is complete, governments can point to one notable success. The past year has seen extraordinary turmoil in global financial markets. Rich-country stockmarkets and currencies have not been spared. Yet Europe has been, comparatively speaking, a safe haven. Intra-European movements in exchange rates have been tiny. This is something that the euro-ii governments had committed themselves to, but their success could not have been taken for granted a year ago. The fact is, at a time of unprecedented financial turbulence, the foreign-exchange markets regarded the promise to stabilise intra-European exchange rates as credible. Currencies have held steady and interest rates have converged: it augurs well for the transition to the new system. 
The next few years are, after all, transitional. National currencies will continue to circulate until the end of zool, albeit at permanently fixed parities. In the meantime, the European System of Central Banks undertakes to defend those parities. In principle this means that if, say, Italians decide to switch all their lire into D-marks, the supply of D-marks will be expanded without limit to accommodate them. Even now there must be some small doubt as to whether, if push comes to shove, this will happen. But if the markets continue to regard the parities as credible-as they did throughout the exceptionally severe test of the past year-then Germany's offer to finance the early retirement of Italy's currency is unlikely to be called upon. 
That danger aside, and for the moment considering EMU only in its economic aspect, two principal risks remain. The first, which will be most acute during the project's early years, is that economic policy in the euro area as a whole will be ill-judged, leading to a recession that discredits the whole venture. The other, which will remain a threat into the medium term, is that the system will prove too inflexible to cope with local (in the jargon, ""asymmetric"") economic shocks. Consider each in turn. 
Independent to a fault 
In designing EMU, the architects laid great emphasis both on the independence of the European Central Bank (ECB) and on the simplicity and severity of its anti-inflation objective. In statutory terms, at least, the ECB may well be the most independent, and most single-minded, central bank in the world. America's Federal Reserve, for instance, is required by law to take output and employment into account alongside inflation, for which no numerical target is set. In addition, the Fed is accountable to Congress, which periodically questions its top officials and sometimes tries to influence their views. The restraint that Congress and the White House show in this regard is a matter of custom, reflecting the standing which the Fed has won for itself in financial markets over many years, and not a matter of law. 
The position of the ECB is quite different. The Maastricht treaty allows for no clear accountability to any other arm of national or European government. In fact the treaty explicitly forbids the ECB and its decision-making bodies to ""seek or take instructions from Community institutions or bodies, from any government of a member state or from any other body"". It also stipulates that the proceedings of the ECB council's meetings will remain confidential. If he chose, Wim Duisenberg, the first chief of the ECB, could nonetheless announce the outcome of its deliberations, together with a commentary and forecasts justifying it. Mr Duisenberg says he is not against this sort of openness. Time will tell. The point is, everything is left for the ECB to decide: this is independence with a vengeance. 
As to aims, the treaty further stipulates that the ECB'S goal is ""price stability"", leaving the bank to decide what that means. In many other countries with ""independent"" central banks-in Britain, for instance-the government sets a target for inflation and reserves the right to change it as circumstances, in its judgment, dictate. EMU has no such escape-clause. Moreover, the bank is forbidden to balance the goal of price stability against other aims. The treaty directs the ECB to ""support the general economic policies of the Community"" but, crucially, it is to do this ""without prejudice to the objective of price stability"". 
The ECB has now defined ""price stability"" to mean inflation of less than 2% a year. In modern times, no major economy has hit such a target consistently over a run of years. America's inflation rate has averaged 3.3% over the past ten years; Germany's, despite the mighty Bundesbank, has averaged 2.8%. In short, a radically undemocratic institution has been charged to achieve, without compromise, an exceptionally demanding goal of virtually zero inflation. 
Strong evidence suggests that centralbank independence is indeed a good idea: any given level of inflation can be achieved more cheaply, in terms of forgone output and employment, if firms and workers believe that monetary policy is free from undue political pressure. The danger is that En,cu'S architects have gone too far. The European Union, with its weak parliament, is acknowledged in any case to have a ""democratic deficit"" at its centre; the powers of the new central bank will make that deficit all the greater. In economic terms, the danger is simply that the ECB will take its instructions literally-and will try to screw inflation down to nothing regardless of wider economic repercussions. 
As it happens, the circumstances seem likely to prove favourable. Forecasters at the OECD expect that output in the euro zone will grow by 212% in the coming year, with inflation remaining at about its present 12% (see table 2). This assumes that short-term interest rates in the euro area will average 3% in 1999, their current level, a full percentage point lower than the average for 1998. All that would presumably suit the ECB pretty well. But more awkward eventualities cannot be ruled out. 
One is that governments, after years of post-Maastricht squeezing and fudging of budget deficits, will ease fiscal policy too much (despite the rule forbidding it, of which more in a moment). That could put upward pressure on inflation and lead the ECB, with little headroom beneath its inflation target, to assert itself at once and raise interest rates (or delay cutting them). An early conflict of this kind between loose fiscal policy and tight monetary policy would be an extremely discouraging start. 
Another even more awkward possibility for monetary policy in EMu'S first year or two is that the OECD'S forecasts for output may prove too optimistic. This is not implausible. The health of the world economy is far from robust. With Wall Street overvalued on every historical measure, the danger of sharp falls in global equity prices in 1999 needs to be taken seriously. That in turn might prompt a worse slowdown in demand than is allowed for in the OECD's central-case forecasts. The question would then be whether the ECB would cut interest rates soon enough and far enough to avoid recession in Europe. 
If the bank waited for inflation to fall before acting, that would be too late. Yet the bank might be reluctant to act more promptly, responding to forecasts of lower inflation rather than to out-turns, as it should, for fear of undermining its credibility with the markets. 
Mr Duisenberg will prefer to err on the side of caution (that is, on the side of lower inflation and higher short-term unemployment) in any case; he will want to be judged by the euro zone's inflation record, maintaining that unemployment is none of his concern. Adding to his desire to establish a tough reputation at the outset will be his memory of the fiasco surrounding his appointment. France wanted to appoint its own candidate to the job; the other countries resisted. The absurd compromise that was settled upon allowed France to say that Mr Duisenberg will step down early in favour of its man, while Mr Duisenberg says that no such promise was made. When Mr Duisenberg comes to be tested, the price of that squabble may well be higher interest rates and fewer jobs. 
A shocking possibility 
In principle, however, a recession that threatens the euro-ii as a group is not the most difficult scenario for the ECB. Once its reputation is established and any teething troubles overcome, a system-wide problem of that kind can be dealt with perfectly well by the system-wide response of a change in interest rates. Indeed, a single central bank is arguably better equipped to deal with such a case than would be ii separate national banks, acting in an unco-ordinated way. That is why, beyond the transitional period, the larger challenge for the new system will be to deal with fluctuations that are not system-wide. 
The euro zone is not what economists call an ""optimum currency area""-that is, it is not a region whose constituent parts are affected in broadly the same way by typical economic disturbances, or among whose constituent parts labour moves freely. If it were, then no economic purpose would be served by retaining sub-European currencies. Admittedly, few if any national economies meet that ideal standard: regions within the United States often suffer asymmetric shocks because of local concentrations of particular industries, and although American labour migrates comparatively smoothly from one state to another, these shifts are by no means costless. 
The point, though, is that the euro zone is very much further from being an optimum currency area than is the United States. Disparities in relative prices (after allowing for exchange-rate fluctuations) are greater among the euro-ii than among American states; and the mobility of labour within Europe is, according to one study, only one-third of the mobility of labour within America. 
Advocates of monetary union argue that the euro will itself narrow the gap, by encouraging closer economic integration. This is quite true. However, even with the euro, the barriers of culture and language are likely to remain stronger in Europe. One perverse consequence of the euro may be that, precisely because it encourages closer integration, it will also promote greater local specialisation-increasing the chance of asymmetric shocks from that source. In sum, for many years to come, persistent national divergences in growth and unemployment are likely to recur from time to time. 
Europe's governments all acknowledge that one way to reduce the costs of these divergences is to improve the supply-side flexibility of their economies. The price of European over-regulation is a both a higher unemployment rate over time, and a greater susceptibility to a further upward ratcheting of this average or equilibrium rate of unemployment with each serious recession. The trouble is, governments have so far proved better at paying lip-service to the need for deregulation than they have at dealing with the problem. The recent shift to the left in European politics makes this remedy all the less likely to be adopted. 
That leaves macroeconomic policy. When a country with its own currency suffers a recession, it is free to cut interest rates. This stimulates demand twice over: first by lowering the cost of credit, and second by causing the currency to depreciate (which spurs exports). Countries in the euro zone will not have this option. Emigration cannot help much (as it would in the case of Michigan, say). And since Europe has only a tiny central budget, net assistance from faster-growing countries (in the form of bigget inflows of public spending and smaller outflows of taxes) will also play a far smaller part than the equivalent fiscal transactions in the United States. 
All that remains is national fiscal policy. The recession-struck economy is still free to borrow on its own behalf, thus stimulating demand and speeding its recovery. Or it would be, except for EMU'S ""Stability and Growth Pact"". This is a rule that governments agreed to at Germany's insistence, requiring budget deficits to be held to 3% of GDP or less. Violators will be fined, subject to a vote of governments, unless output has fallen by 2% or more in the year in question. 
Despite this purported flexibility, the regime (like the rules defining the ECB's aims and freedoms) is exceptionally severe. Falls in output of 2% or more are extremely unusual; far smaller downturns would cause unemployment to rise quickly and be universally regarded as ""recessions"". And the restriction is too tight in another way: governments that tried to anticipate a downturn by relaxing fiscal policy early, thereby breaching the 3% limit before output fell by 2%, would also face fines. The German doubts that led to the adoption of this procedure were exaggerated, albeit not entirely groundless. The concern was that chronic overborrowers would become even more fiscally irresponsible once they had adopted the euro, because they would no longer face the financial-market sanction of higher interest rates and (in the end) a depreciating currency. Moreover, this overborrowing would henceforth be at least partly at the expense of Germany and the other euro countries, because they would bear some of the cost of default, if it came to that. 
The fear is exaggerated because the Maastricht treaty rightly insists that the central bank cannot bail out national governments. Provided that promise is believed, and so long as the no-bail-out rule applies to other finance ministries as well as to the ECB, the markets would attach a risk premium (in the form of a higher interest rate) to borrowing by heavily indebted governments. That is as it should be-and no further discipline should be necessary. As it is, the stability pact calls that promise into doubt, by making budgets a collective responsibility. Worse, in the meantime it rules out counter-cyclical fiscal policy of the sort that will often be necessary, and for which there is no longer any plausible national substitute. 
The crucial question regarding the stability pact, therefore, is the same as for the ECB: given that the design is so bad, how might it work in practice? Today, budget deficits in many euro economies (including the three biggest) stand at more than 2% of GDP (see table 3). If demand in Europe grows more slowly in 1999 than the forecasters expect, those deficits may rise. (In some cases they will tend to rise regardless, as assorted post-Maastricht fudges are unwound.) Governments may soon be faced with the stability-pact requirement to raise taxes and/or cut public spending-even as their economies slide toward recession. Again, therefore, the hope must be that the rules will be bent, or scrapped. If this does not happen, and one or more countries encounter a downturn that the ECB cannot remedy by means of system-wide monetary policy, there are only two alternatives. 
One is that the countries concerned endure a deeper and longer recession than they are used to, or is necessary. This plainly runs the risk of calling forth mounting protests against EMU itself The other is that the fiscal powers available to the centre-the money gathered and spent by Brusselsmust be greatly enlarged. This would allow automatic fiscal stabilisers to work within Europe as they do within the United States of America. Many in Europe would regard this second alternative as desirable in any case, which (if the stability pact survives) makes it the more probable outcome. In any event, this seems likely to be the issue on which Europe's political future turns. 
Ever closer union 
Judged strictly as an economic venture, EMU will be a success if, over the coming years, the participating countries benefit from closer integration (measured by growing trade and investment in the euro area), satisfactory growth, declining unemployment and low inflation. If the single-currency project had been better designed, the chances of achieving this would have been good. Closer economic integration seems assured in any case. A plan that created a properly directed, properly accountable central bank and provided for adequate freedom in national fiscal policy would have done as much as macroeconomic policy can do to take care of the rest. To be sure, that would still have left governments to carry a heavy burden of supply-side reform-without which Europe cannot expect to cut its unemployment to the levels seen in America. Still, the outlook would have been promising. 
As it is, the chances of success are no better than fair. The central bank will have to rise above its flawed design-winning the popular regard it will one day need both by explaining what it is up to, and by balancing the short-term demands of low inflation, on the one hand, and growth in output and employment, on the other, more intelligently than its statutes require. And governments will have to find a way to make fiscal policy respond far more flexibly to economic circumstances than the Maastricht rules allow. 
Ideally this will be done by changing the rules-perhaps to require that budgets are balanced over the course of the economic cycle, but leaving them free to run further into deficit at times of slowing demand than the 3% of GDP allowed by the stability pact. Needless to say, in this case too, efforts to liberalise Europe's markets for goods, services and labour far more determined than governments have made so far will also be required. 
If EMU can overcome the flaws of its design and prove an economic success after all, Europe's governments (and, preferably, their citizens as well) will be able to weigh the coming political choices on their merits. If it fails in economic terms, those political choices may be severely constrainedand, as a result, far more divisive. Closer political integration built on the solid foundation of an EMU that worked would be one thing. The same course adopted in distress to save EMU from failure, or even outright collapse, would be an entirely different, and much more dangerous, enterprise.  1999 PERHAPS the biggest omission in the Maastricht treaty was the failure to clarify the status of the ""outs""-the countries that decline to take part. (Britain, Denmark and Sweden have chosen to stay out; Greece would love to join but is nowhere near satisfying the Maastricht criteria for membership.) This was not an oversight but a deliberate gap, much in accord with the way Europe's architects have tended to proceed. 
The EU'S members are pledged to move towards ""ever closer union"". Implicitly, the idea is that they will approach this goal (as yet undefined) at about the same speed-so the four countries not taking part in Emu at the outset are expected to join as soon as they can. To have designed a durable relationship between the ins and outs might have encouraged further delay. 
It often happens in European politics that if you do not want a contingency to arise, you ignore it, hoping it goes away. Sometimes it does-and this time-honoured approach may also work in the case of EMU'S outs. If monetary union is a success, the qualifying outsiders will warm to the idea. But the collapse of the ERM in 1992-93 showed that the head-in-the-sand method is not infallible. If EMU works badly, outsiders such as Britain are likely to become even more reluctant. 
There is also the question of EU enlargement. Prospective new members in Eastern Europe may not be ready, or may not choose, to join EMu at the beginning. Indeed, they would be wise to be cautious. Their economies are still struggling with the legacy of socialism. For many years yet they are likely to remain structurally different from their western neighbours, leaving them more exposed to the danger of asymmetric economic shocks. This only adds to the case for lasting arrangements allowing Eu countries to opt out of EMU indefinitely. 
The main economic problem posed by a permanent division of the EU into EMU and non-EMu countries is that the outs will be seen by the others as cheats. It is easy to imagine circumstances in which the euro will strengthen against other European currencies, putting euro countries at a competitive disadvantage in trade. If this happens (as well it might) at a time of slowing growth in the euro zone and briskly expanding output elsewhere in the EU, the euro-zone governments will be obliged to object. 
In due course, therefore, some form of monetary co-operation"" will probably be required of the outs, if only as a mark of good faith. One possibility would be a revived ERM, albeit a looser arrangement than the one that collapsed. (For instance, governments might promise to limit variations in their real, as opposed to nominal, exchange rates: this would preserve a measure of monetary discretion while ensuring that governments did not use it to pursue a policy of competitive devaluation.) Failing some such accord, the discussion may move to other ways of correcting the ""unfair"" advantage of the noneuro countries' depreciated currenciesand that is a discussion that could endanger the EU itself 
A permanent union of ins and outs would also raise a host of day-to-day political difficulties. The outs' great fearand what eventually may force them into EMU-is that the centre of decision-making for the EU as a whole will move to the committee of euro-zone finance ministers. This seems certain to happen if EMU runs into trouble, and the euro-zone countries adopt remedies such as collective fiscal policy and/or increased harmonisation of taxes and economic regulations. Even if all goes well, though, a diminution of the outs' political sway seems likely. The ins will surely want to punish the outs, with or without a show of regret. How better to encourage the laggards to change their minds?  1999 Europe's single currency is here, and out goes the ecu. The euro will operate in tandem with local currencies in ii EU countries (four don't want to know), and the new European Central Bank will begin to flex its muscles-but national central banks will still play their parts. Germany takes on the rotating presidencies of not only the European Council and the Western European Union but also the Group of Seven, and New Zealand takes the chair of the Asia-Pacific Economic Co-operation (APEC) forum.

Compiled with help from Future Events News Service, London. http://www.hubcom.com/fens Tel: +44(o)181 672 3191  1999 THE accused has a seemingly simple choice: to fight it out, or to accept his punishment. But is anything in the world of Bill Clinton, the only elected president in America's history to have been impeached by the House of Representatives, truly straightforward? The president's advisers study every nuance of the opinion polls; his lawyers, like grandmasters with a chess board, plot the consequences of this admission or that; fellow Democrats cringe at his sexual shenanigans, but bask in the glow of his impeachment-defying popularity. Meanwhile, the country prays for an end to the saga. 
At some point the Senate will oblige. Just when is still an open question. The momentum that led to the president's impeachment on December 19th remains remorseless. When the new House meets on January 6th, it must first confirm in office Henry Hyde and the 12 other Republican members chosen to manage Mr Clinton's trial before the Senate. When these worthies present themselves and the articles of impeachment to the Senate, the Senate must meet at 1 pm the next day to consider them. Assume that no witnesses are called, and in theory Bill Clinton's (and the country's) ordeal will be over in a matter of days. 
Maybe so. This week the Republican leader of the Senate, Trent Lott, siad he and Tom Daschle, the Democrats' leader, were agreed that there is no need to hear witnesses. Mr Lott's argument is that ""the record is there to be reviewed, read, presented"" in any way the House prosecutors choose, ""and I think that would be sufficient."" Follow Mr Lott's schedule, and the articles of impeachment will be read in the Senate on January 7th; the trial will begin the following Monday, January ith, and last ""a week or two"". 
Will practice be quite so neat? Perhaps not. After all, most of the House Republicans are gung-ho to see the president squirm; their managers are said to be preparing themselves in the ""expectation"" that witnesses will be called; and in the end many senators may not want to snub the House quite so obviously. 
Moreover, if Mr Clinton chooses to fight, Mr Lott's schedule looks otherworldly. True, the president's team seem to have dropped the idea of a time-consuming challenge against the legality of the incoming House being bound by the decisions of its predecessor. But to accept the trial and plead innocence could likewise exhaust the calendar and the nation's patience: the president could reasonably ask the Senate to grant him time to prepare his defence, and this defence-and Henry Hyde's prosecution-would surely involve the calling of witnesses. 
But what if Mr Clinton does not fight? The president may have struck a defiant tone immediately after his impeachment, but he also talked of ""a reasonable, bipartisan, and proportionate response"" that could be ""embraced in the Senate"" as a ""constitutional and fair means of resolving this matter in a prompt manner"". In other words, the president, having expressed contrition ad nauseam, is willing to accept the public censure of Congress, a solution advocated in various forms over the months by senior members of both parties. 
The attractions of censure are many. For Democrats, it provides an escape from the embarrassment of a trial. For Republicans, given the arithmetic of the Senate, it offers a measure of retribution that a trial would in the end deny (a guilty verdict would need the approval of 67 of the loo senators, an unlikely outcome given that the Senate has 55 Republicans and 45 Democrats). 
But censure on whose terms? Robert Byrd, the Senate's senior Democrat and its leading historian, is adamant that-censure or no censure-a trial must be started. It is commonly agreed that it could be ended at any point on a vote by 51 senators, and the Senate could then vote to censure. Indeed, Daniel Patrick Moynihan, the senior Democratic senator from New York, suggests a subtle refinement: let the continuation of the trial be kept in reserve, ready to be invoked if Mr Clinton suddenly decides not to play ball on censure-and let Mr Clinton give censure the force of law, by signing a censure bill sent to him by both House and Senate. Mitch McConnell, a Republican from Kentucky, believes the Senate has a duty to carry a trial to its end and only then, assuming neither article of impeachment garners the support of 67 senators, do ""you sit down and you negotiate the censure alternative."" 
All of which is probably more easily said than achieved. The Republicans and a great many Democrats are adamant that the president must admit that he committed perjury, lying under oath to a grandjury. The president is so far unwilling to admit anything of the sort, mostly for fear of legal consequences (the talk persists of indictments awaiting both him and the First I adv once he has left the White House). From the president's perspective, censure must surely be accompanied by a binding forgiveness, however reluctantly given. 
Is such a bargain impossible? For some idealists, perhaps. But Mr Clinton may well assume that Congress has at least as many pragmatists and that they, like him, can read opinion polls that show his ratings rising as the Republican Party's fall. Meanwhile, it does no harm to gently remind voters and Congress alike that his state-ofthe-union message is due on January 19th; and that, despite Kenneth Starr and the impeachment votes in the House, the state is still looking pretty good.  1999 THE accused has a seemingly simple choice: to fight it out, or to accept his punishment.

IN A sealed room in sprawling Camp Pendleton, a Marine Corps base in California, a young corporal is mastering the use of the most formidable weapon in his arsenal: his brain. A CD-RoM-based simulator takes him through a variety of crises in which he must make split-second decisions and issue instant orders to cope with anything from a sudden burst of enemy gunfire to the approach of a band of thirsty refugees or a roving CNN crew. 
The Camp Pendleton programme is one example of how America is changing the way it trains its armed forces, so that they can handle a post-cold-war world in which charging tank divisions are less common than the chaos of ""low-intensity conflicts"", the jargon for peace-making and peace-enforcement operations. In this new world, the decisions taken by a lg-year-old crouching behind a bush with his finger on the trigger of an M-16 rifle or a laser-aimed missile can have enormous consequences for the foreign policy of the West. 
The Marine Corps, smaller in size and less bureaucratic than its larger cousins of the army, the navy and the air force, is help ing to shape these new training techniques. The 12-day, still-experimental course, of which the CD-ROM simulator is one component, aims to give the young leaders of 12-man sections the decision-making skills and killing authority previously reserved for company or even battalion commanders. Some of the things the marines learn, such as how to stay under cover, are standard military fare. Others, including the counselling skills taught by psychologists, seem to come straight from the world of New Age management gurus; but the young section leaders seem to relish it. 
One aim of the new training system is to enable American soldiers of the 21st century to handle the ""three-block war"". The phrase describes an operation in which they would simultaneously be distributing food and medicine to frantic civilians in one part of a city, quelling rioters and maintaining order in another, and fighting guerrillas in a third. 
Americans have already seen variations of the three-block war in Haiti, Somalia and Bosnia. Memories of the ill-fated rescue operation in Somalia in 1993 still haunt the military planners, especially the ""Ranger ambush"" in which a combined force of Rangers and Delta Force commandos was trapped by Somali gunmen for 18 hours; 18 men were killed and 73 wounded. Although the marines were not involved in that debacle, it is with an eye on the lessons of Somalia that the corps is now putting new emphasis on urban-warfare tactics and the need for first-class leadership of small units. 
The new training goes hand-in-hand with the use of new military instruments, such as the ""non-lethal munitions"" that will help to give American troops a wider range of options when dealing with an adversary than just trying to kill him. At one demonstration held for Camp Pendleton's senior officers, the arsenal of weapons on show included bean-bag projectiles fired from shotguns and grenade-launchers, blinding pepper sprayed from devices the size of fire-extinguishers, ultra-powerful flashlights that can find and dazzle potential snipers, and grenades which explode into a mess of adhesive foam that can block a doorway or goo up a suspected guerrilla. 
But what Americans peering into the future of warfare call the Revolution in Military Affairs, the RMA, also employs sterner weapons than these. In future wars of the Bosnia sort, for instance, small numbers of highly trained men with sophisticated weapons under their control will be ableit is hoped-to defeat much bigger armies of the conventional sort with little or no loss to themselves. Hidden on a hillside miles from the enemy, their fingers on precision-aiming devices, and helped by eyein-the-sky satellites and reconnaissance aircraft, they will be able to steer long-range missiles on to the enemy's tanks or guns; and the enemy will not be able to fire back, because he cannot see them and, even if he could, they are probably out of range. 
In such a fight, the weapons used by the warriors of the RMA will by no means be confined to bean-bags and gluey foam. A look at the equipment on display in Camp Pendleton makes the point. Most of them have two barrels and two triggers: one for firing non-lethal projectiles, the other for delivering the old-fashioned, deadly kind. A switch of the trigger and the kinder, gentler marines of the 21st century instantly become lethal. The advocates of the xn,tR are determined to make sure that America and its allies remain ahead of the rest of the world not only in the military technology they possess but also in the skills needed to use these weapons. 
And what happens when an adversary manages to manufacture, buy or steal a collection of similar weapons, as he doubtless will? Why, by then, say the confident optimists of the RA, America and its trusted allies will be deploying even newer devices that can be fired with equal accuracy from still farther away. 
Some American officers, especially older ones, have their misgivings. They say that a system of war built upon a wish to destroy the enemy without yourself suffering any significant number of casualties is inherently dangerous. Remember that 1993 disaster in Somalia. New kinds of weapons, instructed by satellites and computers, may be able to win future firefights of this sort more swiftly and at less cost to your own men; but the men will still need to be there, to occupy some vital hilltop or essential building, and they will have to be prepared to take the consequences. 
In the end, your soldiers must face the risk of being wounded or killed. Clever and brave guerrillas, fighting in places where they are hard to detect-forests or mountains or city side-streets-have to be pursued by soldiers who are not only expertly trained for such warfare but are also willing to engage the enemy at close quarters. Any adversary, when defeated, leaves behind a region which has to be occupied by your own side, to make sure he does not start the war all over again; and your occupying force is bound to suffer casualties. 
An army that believes it can avoid standing in harm's way is, say the sceptics, liable to prove perilously fragile. The coming century is going to provide plenty of crises in which deadly force, working in both directions, cannot be avoided.  1999 NATURE abhors a vacuum. So do American entrepreneurs. Consider a firm called Autopsy/Post Services (1-800-AUTOPSY), founded in 1988 by Vidal Herrera. The frequency with which autopsies are performed in America has been falling steadily for over three decades, and Mr Herrera has made his mark by leaping in to fill the void. 
Mr Herrera charges $2,000 for a complete autopsy, more if the body has been exhumed or if extra tests are ordered. Many of his customers suspect foul play or malpractice. Others have medical questions that a hospital or insurance company would not pay to have answered. Mr Herrera expects to perform roughly 800 autopsies this year; he has turned away thousands of others across the United States, and in other countries, because he could not handle them from his Los Angeles base. That problem will soon be over; in January, Autopsy/Post Services will begin selling franchises in 72 American cities and 16 countries. 
The success of 1-800-AuTOPSY aside, public-health experts are alarmed by the falling number of conventional autopsies. In 196o, roughly one in two deaths in Chicago area hospitals was followed up with an autopsy; that rate is now about one in ten. Federal data collected since 1972 show the same trend. Indeed, experts note that autopsy rates are falling around the world. 
Autopsies can be used to determine the effectiveness of surgical procedures and drug treatments. They provide accurate vital statistics, teach medical students, uncover new diseases and spot old ones that may be spreading. All the while, they sniff out incompetent medical care and the odd murder that might have passed for a slip in the bathtub. George Lundberg, editor of the Journal of the American Medical Association (AMA), points out that medical conditions such as toxic shock syndrome and congenital heart disease (as well as many others) were discovered by autopsy. Toxic shock has now been pretty much stamped out; congenital heart disease can be treated successfully with surgery. 
An autopsy is perhaps the onlyway for the dead to speak to the living. Why are Americans listening less? One reason is cost. An autopsy can run up a bill from several hundred dollars to several thousand, depending on the methodology. In the days before the health-care system began slimming down, most insurance policies covered the procedure. If not, hospitals politely picked up the tab. No longer. As Hmos, insurance companies and hospitals struggle to distribute scarce resources, they tend to favour the living over the dead. (State and local governments have the right to demand an autopsy in any case where foul play is suspected or the cause of death is unknown.) 
Autopsy, like organ donation, is a difficult subject to broach with grieving families (though the public good associated with both can help the grieving process The attending physician is the logical person to suggest a post-mortem exam; yet all too often a doctor's primary concern is covering his own gluteus maximus. An autopsy may prove a doctor wrong, or even negligent. 
Doctors with better intentions may simply believe that more sophisticated laboratory tests and imaging technology have made the autopsy redundant. Alas, they have not. A study by researchers at Louisiana State University Medical Centre used autopsies to determine that doctors missed 44% of cancerous tumours while patients were alive. Another study at the University of Pittsburgh found a 45% discordance between what clinical doctors diagnosed as the cause of death and what an autopsy later showed it to be. 
In 1988, the JAMA ran an issue round the theme: ""Declaring war on the non-autopsy"". So far, it has been more of a slow retreat. Last month, the Journal took up the torch once again. An editorial proposed a minimum autopsy rate as a condition for hospital accreditation and/or Medicare reimbursement. Meanwhile Mr Herrera, looking ahead to a bulge of dying babyboomers, foresees endless opportunities.  1999 ON AUGUST 15th, Timothy Boomer fell out of his canoe. Naturally, he cursed, using ""loudly and repeatedly . . . a most offensive vulgarity"" together with ""various derivatives"". He was in the middle of nowhere at the time, in a wilderness area of the Rifle River near the Jack Pine Trail in Michigan. Imagine his surprise, therefore, when a deputy sheriff from Arenac County promptly issued him with a ticket for swearing. 
Mr Boomer had failed to note that besides the sheriff, Kenneth Socia, and his buddies sitting on the bank, there were also a woman and two children enjoying the rustic scene within earshot of his oaths. He had therefore infringed a Michigan obscene-speech law, more than a century old, which reads: 
Sec. 337: Indecent, etc, language in presence of women-Any person who shall use any indecent, immoral, obscene, vulgar or insulting language in the presence or hearing of any woman or child shall be guilty of a misdemeanour. 
And being guilty of a misdemeanour, he faces a 90-day jail term or a $100 fine if convicted. Mr Boomer argued for dismissal of the charges, but failed, and now he is about to stand trial. 
The American Civil Liberties Union has leapt in to support him. It argues that cursing is a form of free speech, and that what was unacceptable to delicate 19thcentury ears is now commonplace; so commonplace that, Mr Boomer argues, the four women canoeing with him didn't turn a hair. The prosecutors are less forgiving. Cursing, they say, does not express an idea or a thought. What? Not even the thought that Hell! This water's cold!? Or Damn! The girls are watching!?  1999 THE scholar warms almost instantly to his theme: ""We have been so stable, apart from the Civil War, that we think it natural. Britain and the us are the only countries since 18oo not to have had their form of government changed by violence. You take stability as a given, when in fact it's a rarity."" In other words, let the Senate be wary when it sets about the trial of Bill Clinton. 
It is a good point, seldom heard in the impeachment blather that has filled America's airwaves for the past year. But the scholar is Daniel Patrick Moynihan, the senior Democratic senator for New York, and perhaps his voice, his manner, his lateral leaps of creative reasoning are a shade too eccentric to make him a talk-show regular. True, he has made more than two dozen appearances on NBC's ""Meet the Press""-but over 31 years. Most recently, just after Christmas, he managed to quote off-the-cuff not just from Shakespeare's ""Troilus and Cressida"" (""Lechery, lechery; still, wars and lechery: nothing else holds fashion"") but also from Dr Johnson. These are not the sound-bites of normal television. 
But Mr Moynihan is not a normal politician. Michael Barone, one of America's finest political pundits, describes him as ""the nation's best thinker among politicians since Lincoln and its best politician among thinkers since Jefferson."" Of the thinking, there is no doubt. Most senators stuff their offices with photos of themselves meeting other important people. This senator stuffs his with books-not just his own (18 at the latest count) but also the Encyclopaedia Judaica, the International Encyclopaedia of the Social Sciences, bound volumes of the Public Interest, back issues of Political Science Quarterly, and so on. On the mantlepiece is a lunch invitation from the Maharajah of Jodhpur(Mr Moynihan is, after all, a former ambassador to India, as well as to the UN). In short, the office is a don's delight, and Mr Moynihan-large sherry glass in hand, jaunty bow-tie not quite matching the breast-pocket handkerchief-suits it perfectly. 
But what of the politics? In the age of the professional politician, can the Barone superlative really fit a man whose working life has been spent flitting back and forth between academia (Tufts, Harvard, Oxford, the London School of Economics) and public service (posts under Presidents Kennedy,Johnson, Nixon and Ford)? Is Mr Moynihan not just a clever, witty Jack-of-alltrades, with all that the cliche implies? 
Actually, no. One simple reason is that the best politicians are those who get re-elected, and Mr Moynihan, even though he ""hates"" raising campaign money and presses to reform the system, is now in his fourth term in the Senate. They are also those who get things done, which in Mr Moynihan's case means not just some solid environmental and social legislation but also what is now known as ""Ice-Tea"", the 1991 Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act, which-not by coincidence-has channelled billions of dollars of public spending to New York's road and rail systems. 
But the best justification for the Barone superlative is that, despite appearances, there is an unbroken thread running through the Moynihan career: an interest in governance. The senator is a policy wonk with the political skills, regularly applied across party lines, to put ideas into practice. Witness his far-sighted study of 1965, ""The Negro Family"", in which he emphasised the connection between fatherless families and increased welfare rolls. Although it was largely ignored at the time, that study led to the 1988 Welfare Reform Act, which for the first time recognised a father's duty to support his children (and a mother's responsibility to find a job). 
What, then, does he think of the 1996 ""welfare-to-work"" reforms, which limit federal handouts to a lifetime total of five years? Not a lot, is the short answer: no one knows what will happen when people fall off the ""five-year cliff"". Perhaps his fears of social distress-he points out that 97% of births to teenage mothers in Washington, Dc, are out of wedlock-will prove groundless. But perhaps not. After all, the reason the eccentric Mr Moynihan is so respected is that he has so often been right. He was, for example, the first to mock CIA assessments of the strength of the Soviet Union, arguing that it was bound to disintegrate under the pressure of its ethnic differences. He was possibly the first to apply epidemiological theory to drugs policy (noting that their illegality promotes crime, he coined the phrase ""iatrogenic government"", comparing government to a doctor whose intrusion only makes a patient worse). And he was an early critic of the Clintons' abortive 1993 effort to reform health care, arguing that with five out of six Americans covered by health insurance, and with free or subsidised care provided for the poor and elderly, the true crisis was not in the health system but the welfare system. 
So is he right in his warnings about impeachment? Is it true, as he told ""Meet the Press"", that ""we could so easily mutate into a president of the month"", with a congressional majority ""routinely removing presidents"" and House speakers therefore becoming presidents? He admits the prospect is hard to imagine, but it is still wise to assure institutional stability. The voice rises in volume and, with an exaggerated roll of the ""r"", the senator points out that the founding fathers talked of ""treason"" as a reason to remove a president from office, not the sins of Mr Clinton. 
But it is getting late; the tutorial must end; the second tumbler of sherry must be regretfully declined. Outside, Pennsylvania Avenue-beautified at the senator's initiative-is almost deserted. What a pity, thinks the student, that the professor, risen from a fatherless childhood in New York's Hell's Kitchen to become a seemingly permanent star of the Senate, should be intent on retiring in 2000. Mr Moynihan roars with laughter: ""Good God, man. It's my teeth, my lower back, and it was understood with my wife at the last election that I wouldn't stand again."" But what a pity, all the same.  1999 Forty years of revolutionary fervour have left Cuba's economy in ruins and its future uncertain. But Fidel Castro remains unchallenged 
ON JANUARY 1st, Cubans celebrated not only the beginning of 1999, but the 40th anniversary of Fidel Castro's revolution. There does not seem much to celebrate. The economy is in a mess. Corruption is rife. Prostitution is rampant. Despite police or neighbourhood watchdogs on every street corner, crime is rising. The country's infrastructure is crumbling. The grand promises of the past 40 years are in tatters. In some ways, Cuba seems worse off in 1999 than it was in 1959. And yet, curiously, the chief author of these misfortunes, Mr Castro himself, still retains a place in the heart of most Cubans. 
Mr Castro claims he has no power, only great authority. This is bogus. Outspoken critics end up in jail or exile. And yet Fidelas he is almost universally known-is not loathed as are most other dictators. There are no statues to him, no buildings named after him, no Saddam-style posters. Instead, Fidel's monuments are six-hour speeches and television and radio coverage of his every public word, thought and deed. Most Cubans are inured to this constant stream of bombast, tolerating it with a shrug. Many feel affection for the man who has stood up for so long to the United States. In the countryside, he is even loved by some, especially by older Cubans, despite their country's impoverishment, which can at least be partly blamed on the Yanqui blockade. 
Most people know that Fidel's original socialist dream has long been dead, and they want changes. But they are also wary of what full-blooded western capitalism might bring. They do not want to lose the ""gains of the revolution""-a welfare state, free education and health care. These are real achievements for such a relatively poor country, although the country's dismal economy has now crippled all three. Many would like to see Fidel retire gracefully. Few are keen on a violent overthrow. 
Intelligent, capable, capricious, Mr Castro retains almost total control over every aspect of government-which is the biggest reason why the country is in such a mess. In the words of one restaurant owner: ""As soon as something begins to work, it is halted. As soon as anything becomes profitable, it is stopped."" 
After a series of crackdowns on private sector activity, Cubans have become wary and secretive. Most do not keep bank accounts (because the government would then know how much money they have). The black economy is huge, and more efficient than the state sector. But it corrodes certain values and is undermining the public sector itself. Doctors steal drugs from hospitals to sell for dollars. State stores and markets are surrounded by people selling pilfered goods. 
The sugar harvest in 1998, beset by a series of weather disasters, was 3.zm tonnes: the smallest crop in 50 years. Hit by low prices for sugar and nickel, Cuba's main products, the country's overall exports fell by ii% while imports grew by 6%. Its trade deficit was over $2 billion in 1997. Once the final figures are calculated for 1998, the total trade deficit is likely to be far worse. 
When Mr Castro took power, he based development on the ""three pillars of the Cuban revolution"": health, education and industrialisation. The Cuban economy now rests on just two pillars: tourism-Cuba's biggest hard-currency earner-and Miami. Money sent by Cuban exiles to relations in Cuba is now estimated to bring the island over $1 billion a year in cash alone, more than Cuba earns from sugar exports. 
As the 40th-anniversary speeches drone on, two questions will be on most Cubans' minds: how will the reign of Fidel come to an end, and what will happen when he goes? Of course, most people want a peaceful change of power. This is most likely if Mr Castro hands it over willingly. The ""Pinochet scenario"" is often discussed sotto voce, but it is unlikely to happen largely because Mr Castro is not the kind of man to stand aside. Moreover, General Pinochet's detention in Britain shows that it may no longer be safe to be a former dictator, at least a travelling one. 
It is more likely that Mr Castro, now aged 72, will die in harness, ranting and speechifying to his last breath. Unfortunately for Cuba's future, he is in good health, despite rumours to the contrary. If he does die in office, with no effort at a transition to democratic rule, Cubans could face the violence and political chaos they fear the most. The designated heir is General Raul Castro, Fidel's brother and head of the armed forces. But he is not popular, and is only five years younger than Fidel. Few think he would be able to hold on to power for long. A small group of technocrats who have occasionally succeeded in persuading a reluctant Mr Castro to loosen economic controls might gain power and then ease Cuba towards democracy. But the chances ofthis happening do not look high. With Fidel's passing, such technocrats are likely to lose all authority. 
However Mr Castro departs, his successors will immediately face not only pentup demands at home, but also demands for the return of property seized by the Castro government, or for compensation. Ownership of oil refineries, hotels, farmland, nickel mines-all currently run by foreign investors-is claimed by American citizens or Cuban exiles. Many houses, now occupied by several families, and many buildings that have been turned into schools or hospitals, once belonged to people who are now living in Miami. For this reason alone, the return of the exiles from Miami is dreaded by many Cubans. Their anxiety has been ruthlessly exploited by the regime, but it is real nonetheless. 
Forty years of being dominated by one loquacious, erratic man has left Cubans with a ruined economy, disintegrating public services and an uncertain future. With no plausible political heirs in sight, no credible opposition and an exile community itching not only for return, but revenge, Cubans are right to fear chaos or even civil war after Mr Castro goes. Not much of a legacy, nor much to celebrate.  1999 IT WAS not supposed to be like this. When Fernando Henrique Cardoso persuaded his country's Congress to overturn a constitutional ban on incumbents seeking reelection, he seemed to have the credentials to enter history not just as the man who had vanquished his country's chronic inflation, but as a great modernising leader of a kind Brazil had not seen for three decades. 
He may yet achieve such stature But, as he starts his second term on January 1st, Brazil's prospects are gloomy, and fraught with risk. Mr Cardoso had once hoped that his second term would be devoted to social and political reform-the president is, after all, a social democrat in an unequal and unjust country. Instead, Mr Cardoso must grapple with the pressing unfinished business of his first term: shoring up the country's precarious economic and financial stability. 
That involves swiftly completing the task of getting Congress to approve a huge fiscal squeeze, involving tax increases and spending cuts amounting to 28 billion reais ($23.5 billion) and aimed at cutting the fiscal deficit from 8% of GDP in 1998 to around 4.7% in 1999. That is the main condition of the $41.5 billion rescue package which the IMF agreed to in November, and which the government hopes will restore confidence in Brazil's economic policies. 
Success would mean that in a year's time Brazil might emerge from recession with its economy fundamentally strengthened. Failure would mean not just a forced devaluation of Brazil's currency, but would also damage Mr Cardoso's credibility, perhaps irreparably. Since August, his government has spent over $30 billion in reserves defending the real, and its defence was the platform on which he won the presidential election in October. But even if Mr Cardoso succeeds in making fiscal austerity stick, Brazil is clearly facing a hard year in 1999. 
As expected, Mr Cardoso's team has not radically changed. Of 31 ministers and secretaries, 23 served in the first administration. The dozen front-line ministers to keep their jobs include Pedro Malan, the finance minister and architect of the IMF agreement, whose position has grown steadily stronger as the economy has weakened. 
A sign of this is Mr Cardoso's choice of Celso Lafer to head a new Ministry of Development, which will handle industrial policy. The creation of this ministry is intended to make fiscal austerity more politically palatable. It is seen as a potential source of alternative policies by those, such as FIESP, the Sao Paulo industrialists' federation, who dislike Mr Malan's orthodoxies and would prefer devaluation, lower interest rates and higher tariffs. Yet Mr Lafer is unlikely to oblige them. Though once a director of a family metal-bashing firm, and the cousin of FIESP'S energetic new chairman, Mr Lafer is an academic whose last job was as Brazil's ambassador to the World Trade Organisation. He lacks the political clout, and probably the inclination, to challenge Mr Malan. 
Mr Cardoso has left the main social ministries in the hands of his own Social Democratic Party. Paulo Renato de Souza stays as education minister, a job he has held for four years-a rare and effective example of continuity in a crucial area that is often poorly administered in Latin America. Like Jose Serra, the health minister, his task is now to make a smaller budget go further. A dozen other ministers owe theirjobs to Mr Cardoso's need to satisfy his allies in his four-party, centre-right coalition. The president has made it plain that to keep their jobs they have to deliver votes in Congress for the austerity measures. 
Marshalling its broad but unreliable majority in Congress remains the government's biggest challenge. According to David Fleischer,a political scientist at the University of Brasilia, the big winner in the new team (apart from Mr Malan) is Clovis Carvalho, the presidents chief of staff. A plan to set up a new Ministry of Government, which would have handled political liaison and encroached on Mr Carvalho's turf, has come to nothing. 
But Mr Carvalho is widely disliked in Congress. Already, the government's failings in this area have cost it dearly. Poor liaison with Congress was the main reason for two setbacks in the implementation of the fiscal package. The first was the defeat last month of a law increasing civil servants' pension contributions, an unpopular but essential measure. The second was the government's delay in presenting a bill to extend and increase a tax on bank cheques. These setbacks could cost the government up to to billion reais in 1999, and they have already set off a new round of jitters in the financial markets. 
All is not yet lost. On December 3oth, the government announced emergency tax rises and spending cuts aimed at raising 6.7 billion reais. The new Congress elected in October, which starts work in February, may be more tractable. Mr Fleischer points out that about 50 of the more notorious backsliders in the ruling coalition will not be returning. In due course, the government will try again to get approval for higher pension contributions. 
But time is short. At the end of February, the In.iF will make its first check on Brazil's progress. The financial markets will make their own, and probably more rigorous, judgment. By then, the government must take credible steps to make austerity stick. Otherwise, Mr Cardoso risks going into history as the leader who, by failing to give firm fiscal underpinning to the real, squandered Brazil's best development opportunity in more than a generation.  1999 Facing a strengthened opposition, India's ruling party confronts progress 
MOTHER TERESA was no saint but a Christian zealot who terrorised those who refused to convert. Amartya Sen was slightly more deserving of his Nobel prize (for economics), but the mass literacy he champions would seduce Hindus away from their religion. These startling views come from Ashok Singhal, president of the Vishwa Hindu Parishad (World Hindu Council). That Christians make up a tiny (2.3%) share of India's population makes the remarks even more bizarre. But they count for something. At virtually the same time Mr Singhal was sounding off, Hindu militants were attacking Christians and their churches in the western state of Gujarat. Mr Singhal's group is an influential associate of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS), which leads a family of Hindunationalist groups to which the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), India's ruling party, also belongs. 
The sJP seems embarrassed. It governs Gujarat and the attacks are continuing. On December 3oth mobs set fire to two Roman Catholic prayer halls. Though far from communal violence at its worst, the attacks undermine the party's boast that minorities are secure where it rules and feed the claim of a resurgent opposition that the sJP is the party of intolerance. The sJP-led government has sent officials to Gujarat to investigate. 
All great political parties have wings and fringes, sJs-men point out. Look at New and Old Labour in Britain and America's Republican Party, which encompasses flat-taxers and fundamentalists, internationalists and isolationists. But there is a difference. Most successful parties suborn ideology to the achievement of power. The BJP, on the other hand, is the creation of an ideological brotherhood that regards politics as the handmaiden of culture and religion. It is as if the Republican Party were the political wing of a less benign version of the Christian Coalition. That deformity is hobbling India's government. 
So far, mostly in economic policy. Following the BJP's humiliation in three state elections in November, it briefly looked as if the party's pragmatists would tame the ideologues of the RSS. The prime minister, Atal Behari Vajpayee, shuffled his cabinet and appointed allies not beloved ofthe Rss. The winter session of Parliament was supposed to show that the BJP could govern in spite of tensions within the Rss and among the 18 parties in the ruling coalition. 
It proved no such thing. The government had wanted to pass some 40 bills; in the event just 17 were introduced to the lower house of Parliament and just 14 were passed. Among the casualties were two much-touted economic reform bills, one to open insurance to competition and foreign investment, the other to curb piracy of patented products. Both measures attracted opposition, some of it from trade unionists, who regard competition as a threat to jobs, some of it from left-wing parties allergic to liberalisation. But the opposition that mattered most came from the BjP's own swadeshi (buy Indian) lobby, which takes its cue from the Rss rather than from Mr Vajpayee. Both bills stalled. Though the government now talks of starting the next session of Parliament early to get them passed, it remains to be seen whether the swadeshi lobby will allow this. 
The BJP has had more luck keeping the blandishments of Mr Singhal and people like him from becoming national policy. The large number of parties in the coalition, in most respects a hindrance to good government, have supplied Mr Vajpayee with an excuse. The coalition's governing manifesto drops significant portions of the Hindu-nationalist wish-list, such as the call to end the autonomy granted under the constitution to Jammu & Kashmir, India's only Muslim-majority state. Proximity to power has mellowed even the home minister, LK. Advani, the ideologues' most powerful friend in government. On December 6th, six years after the Babri mosque in Ayodhya was demolished by Hindu militants, he called its destruction ""singularly unfortunate"". His regret is an affront to the RSS'S saffron brigades, whose dearest wish is to build a temple on what they believe to be the birthplace of the god Ram. 
To Christians such sentiments ring hollow. Yet the BJP must at least pretend to disavow the ideologues to retain power. It is not that Hindus reject Hindutva, the notion that India is defined by its Hindu way of life. According to a recent poll in India Today, most Indians support Hindutva nostrums, such as the compulsory singing in schools of ""Vande Mataram"", a patriotic song offensive to some Muslims. But not fervently enough to overlook the BJP's failings in government. Indians fault the BJP for the blundering of the hydraheaded coalition it leads and a rise in the price of onions and other staples. They think the opposition Congress party would provide more stable and competent government. The poll suggested that if an election were called now, Congress would trounce the BJP. 
The BJP cannot recoup by fanning communal tensions. One reason Congress did well in November's state elections was that minorities, especially Muslims, returned to their traditional support of the party after a period of disenchantment. A BJP-inspired outbreak of communal violence would drive many Hindus in the same direction. Most of the party's leaders, though not Rss die-hards, realise that it would confirm the B's inability to govern. 
Achieving such enlightenment on economic reform is harder. There are few votes in promoting the interests of foreign insurers and pharmaceutical firms, the most ob vious beneficiaries of insurance and patent legislation. When the executive committee of the BJP meets in Bangalore on January 2nd and 3rd, Mr Vajpayee will try to persuade his colleagues that such reforms also belong to the compulsions of power. The Hindu-nationalist family is being made to swallow a show of tolerance in Delhi, if not in Gujarat. Can it be forced to swallow progress as well?  1999 YET another government has collapsed in the Himalayan kingdom of Nepal. The latest political crisis arose when the prime minister, Girija Prasad Koirala, resigned after one of his partners pulled out of the ruling coalition. Though Mr Koirala has put together a new coalition and was reappointed to the prime ministership by King Birendra on December 23rd, the new government-the sixth since the last general election in 1994-will not last long either: Mr Koirala hopes to win approval from parliament on January 14th for an election in April. 
Nepal has been struggling to establish a stable form of multi-party government since April 199o, when a pro-democracy movement obliged King Birendra to end his almost absolute rule and become a constitutional monarch. Since no single party has been able to count on a majority, all sorts of ideologically incompatible coalitions have been formed. In order to encompass a wide range of parties, they have often been burdened with huge cabinets (one had 48 ministers). 
Mr Koirala's latest coalition includes one of Nepal's two main communist parties, the United Marxist Leninist Party (which is not really much to the left of the prime minister's centrist Nepali Congress Party). The outgoing partner in the previous coalition was the other main communist group which, confusingly, also calls itself the Marxist Leninists. The coalition also includes the Nepal Sadbhavana, a regional party. The prime minister has managed to keep his cabinet to just ni members-one of them, for the first time in eight years, a nominee of the king. 
Since Nepal has seen so much political paralysis, the euphoria that accompanied the end of the king's rule in one of the world's poorest countries has long faded. ""We are just muddling through,"" says Sridhar Khatri, a professor of political science at Tribhuvan University in Katmandu. ""There is no political architecture emerging."" Some blame a Supreme Court ruling that has prevented several prime ministers from dissolving parliament and holding an election. That has obliged politicians to stay in power on the basis of opportunistic agreements. 
Will the new poll produce a clear winner? Opinion differs. Some people argue that the Nepali Congress Party has a good chance ofwinning a majority because it is now more united. Others foresee yet another hung parliament. 
The result may well depend on how Nepal's communists divide their votes among the various parties. A Maoist group could also disrupt the election. It is involved in an increasingly bloody insurgency, which has claimed over 400 lives since it began in February 1996.  1999 SENIOR Khmer Rouge leaders have apologised, for the first time, for the suffering they caused between 1975 and 1979 when some 1.7m people are reckoned to have died during the movement's reign of terror. Speaking to reporters in Phnom Penh, Khieu Samphan, aged 67, the former nominal leader of the Khmers Rouges, was asked if he had regrets about what they had done. He replied, ""Yes, sorry, very sorry."" Sitting alongside him, looking uneasy, was Nuon Chea, aged 71, the movement's chief ideologue, and Brother Number Two to Pol Pot, who died in the jungle in 1998. Silent for most of the 3o-minute press conference, he offered a rather bizarre apology: for the deaths of animals as well as people. ""They all died because we wanted to win the war,"" he said. 
Suggestions that the pair should stand trial before an international tribunal for crimes against humanity were brushed aside. Mr Samphan said the outside world should let Cambodia solve its own problems. ""Let bygones be bygones,"" he said, repeating the dismissivewords used byprevious Khmer Rouge defectors. He did, however, acknowledge the bitterness felt by many Cambodians whose families had been murdered. He had experienced their anger at first hand in 1991 when he narrowly escaped lynching after returning to Phnom Penh from a meeting in Paris to bring a formal end to the civil war. 
This time there was no lynch mob. The casual observer might have been forgiven for thinking the two men were diplomats enjoying vip treatment. They were warmly welcomed by the prime minister, Hun Sen, on December 29th at his residence on the outskirts of the Cambodian capital, and treated to lunch. They have been staying at a luxury hotel, equipped with a swimming pool, tennis courts and golf range. 
Mr Hun Sen indicated that it was unlikely that the pair would have to face trial for crimes against humanity. He said such a trial would be divisive and might mean a return to civil war. His argument has not been well received by many Cambodians. Allowing rank-and-file former Khmers Rouges to make new lives without punishment is mainly accepted. But there is opposition to such tolerance being extended to Pol Pot's henchmen. Many Cambodians say they are not concerned so much about retribution. But they believe a trial might throw light on why the Khmers Rouges sought to bring such misery to the country. 
King Sihanouk, sensing growing public anger over the soft treatment of the pair, has now said that he would not be willing to grant an amnesty to the two men. In part, that is academic. Neither man has yet been charged with anything. For his part, King Sihanouk has said he believes any international court would have the ""perfect right"" to take up the case of genocide in Cambodia. Two years ago, the king, under pressure from the Cambodian government, pardoned leng Sary, who had once been Pol Pofs foreign minister, but had more recently become a useful go-between in arranging defections. In 1979 he had been sentenced to death, in his absence, for genocide. Prince Sihanouk, as he was, briefly held the office of head of state under the Khmers Rouges. He was virtually a prisoner in his palace but may be embarrassed by the connection to the regime. 
Human-rights groups also believe that Mr Samphan and Mr Nuon Chea should be brought to trial. They bear responsibility for many of the Khmers Rouges' misdeeds, and the groups say it is important to break Cambodia's ""culture of impunity"", where killers go free while petty thieves without protection from powerful people are jailed.  1999 China was supposed to be growing more tolerant of dissent. It isn't 
THE authorities dithered for months, then showed their mailed fist. Orga-, nisers of the first, open opposition to Communist rule, the Chinese Democratic Party, which declared itself last summer by attempting to register in 14 provinces and big cities, were rounded up in late November. On December 21st, Xu Wenli, a veteran of the Democracy Wall movement of 1978-79, began a 13-year sentence for ""attempting to overthrow the state"". At least he was allowed a lawyer, through whom he smuggled out a note declaring that his ""so-called open trial was in truth nothing more than a means for political persecution"". 
Qin Yongmin and Wang Youcai were denied legal defence. Mr Qin, another Democracy Wall veteran, was jailed for 12 years and Mr Wang, a student leader at the time of the Tiananmen protests in 1989, got ii years. In case the message of Communist intolerance was still not clear, on December 27th, Zhang Shanguang was sent to prison for ten years for giving Radio Free Asia, financed by America, details of farmers' protests in central Hunan province. 
Western governments have delivered unusually forceful protests. But anger is overlaid with embarrassment. After all, the same Chinese leaders who decided upon the stiff sentences are those whose backs are slapped at international gatherings for their economic sophistication. And much has been made by Bill Clinton's administration of the new policy of engagement rather than confrontation with China over human rights. For a time, success appeared to be at hand. China's two most prominent jailed dissidents were released into American care, Wei Jingsheng in 1997 and Wang Dan in April 1998. A third, Liu Nianchun, was released on medical grounds to America on December 22th. 
Mr Clinton's state visit last June seemed to coincide with a new air of tolerance in China, a thaw warm enough to be termed a ""Beijing spring"". Just last October China signed (but did not ratify) the United Nations covenant on civil and political rights. Now the engagement scorecard looks less impressive: three dissidents released, but four others newly sent to prison. Though China may well see these as future chips (their exile in return for western concessions in other fields), America will find it harder to justify such Faustian bargains. 
Some in western governments hope a rod can be held to China's back with the annual UN review of its human-rights record. In the past China has dissuaded the Geneva panel from passing judgment. Success this time cannot be assured. But China either thinks that a damning at the UN can be avoided as usual, as western criticism gives way to commercial self-interest, or that a rebuke is worth bearing. 
Either way, China's leaders will not put international outrage above any internal threats to their iron rule. The proletariat and peasantry, whom they claim to represent, pose a restive threat to ""stability"", as iron-rice-bowl jobs are lost and new jobs are hard to find. Some western analysts think that China's economy is through the worst of its troubles. Indeed, on December 3oth the government announced the economy had grown by a remarkable 7.8% in 1998-not far short of the 8% target that China's leaders had ""guaranteed"". But Chinese statistics are not reliable, and the growth figures have been hugely inflated. 
Moreover, the coming year is full of events whose political symbolism the party alone must define, among them the 5oth anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic and the return of Macau, a Portuguese enclave, to the ""motherland"". The jailing of dissidents is just one way the Chinese government is setting the tone. 
President Jiang Zemin has recently given stern speeches promising to nip dissent ""in the bud"". Fresh threats have been issued to workers thinking of organising independently. New rules threaten film directors, singers and software developers with life imprisonment if they ""endanger national security"". And on the edges of China's empire, the rhetoric has been turned up. In the western province of Xinjiang, the party secretary declares that the situation there is getting ""acute and complicated"", justification for hardline vigilance. 
The combination of a new political chill together with evidence of delay in some of China's most pressing economic reforms has shaken the assumptions of many western observers. Some have even begun to wonder aloud whether China's ""reform period"" is drawing to a close. But nothing has really changed. Since the Tiananmen threat to one-party rule, the Communists' determination ought not to have been in doubt: reforms and greater openness of expression, though welcome in principle, will not willingly be allowed at the expense of Communist authority.  1999 More bombast than policy on both sides as America and Britain confront Iraq 
IT IS easier to start a fight with Iraq than to end one. So America and Britain discovered when they called off their four-day bombing campaign against Iraq on December 19th, only to find the Iraqis taking repeated pot-shots at their pilots ten days later amid a row over the ""no-fly zones"" that cover half the country. So, indeed, the past eight years have shown, as successive American and British governments have enforced the sanctions imposed on Iraq after it invaded Kuwait in 199o. Has the latest episode brought a conclusion any closer? 
The bombing did put an end, at least for the time being, to the work of Unscom, the United Nations body charged with disposing of Iraq's deadliest weapons. In the wake of the American and British attack, Iraq announced that the arms inspectors, who had fled the country hours before the bombing began, would not be allowed back. 
Never fear, insisted American officials, their bombs had made a significant dent in Saddam Hussein's weapons programmes. General Henry Shelton, America's top soldier, announced that nine Iraqi missile factories had been put out of operation ""for at least a year"", while his British counterpart proudly described the destruction of special aircraft designed to spray biological and chemical stuff. The two powers also claimed to have blitzed barracks, ministries, presidential palaces and various factories that might otherwise, they said, have been put to nefarious purposes. 
But the Iraqis are dab hands at hiding their assets, as Unscom's inspectors have long complained. They shrugged off the attacks, insisting, quite credibly, that most of the destroyed buildings had already been emptied of men and machinery. One serving Unscom inspector questioned the usefulness of the bombing; he might also have asked why, if America and Britain knew where to find Mr Hussein's secret weapons, they had not let the inspectors know. 
Much of the rest of the world was equally unimpressed. Russia's President Boris Yeltsin called the strikes ""illegal and senseless"" and briefly recalled his ambassadors from America and Britain. France protested by pulling its aircraft out of the force that has been patrolling the no-fly zone over southern Iraq (it had earlier withdrawn from the northern patrol) Arabs took to the streets throughout the Middle East, storming the American embassy in Damascus and demonstrating in Rabat. Their embarrassed governments protested more mutedly, but did complain that the bombing had undermined any hope of persuading Iraq to co-operate with the UN and thus be rehabilitated into the world. 
America and Britain retort that they are as keen as everyone else to sort out the whole mess. After they called off their bombers, they produced a new five-point strategy for dealing with Iraq. They will keep up their threat of force, encourage the Iraqi opposition, try to get inspections under way again, step up patrols of the Gulf against sanctions-busting smugglers and launch a diplomatic offensive to bring the world round to their point of view. 
As energetic as all this sounds, it amounts to almost nothing. Mr Hussein has weathered many bombings, and doubtless thinks he can survive a few more. The Iraqi opposition is laughable, and the $97m earmarked for it by America even more so (each of the 325 cruise missiles fired at Iraq during the bombing campaign cost $1.2m) America's only plan to get the inspectors back into Iraq is to refuse to lift sanctions until they have finished their work. Although smugglers do get round the sanctions, they do so chiefly through Iran and Syria, where America has little influence, or through Turkey, where it winks at the infractions. And America is already trying to persuade the rest of the world to swallow its Iraqi policy, with ever-dwindling success. Essentially, America and Britain plan to let Iraq stew. 
The Iraqis complain that they have been left to stew painfully for eight years under the most all-encompassing sanctions in history, with no hope of a reprieve. All along Mr Hussein has tried to protest and prod until the international consensus on sanctions falls apart. Although frustrating Unscom was his favourite means of attracting attention, he is already testing new methods of challenging America's stranglehold. The current spate of attacks on aircraft in the no-fly zone, or his renewed threat to end the UN's humanitarian programme, could both bring about a new crisis. 
So far, no country has broken ranks and openly defied the sanctions, although several-especially the Arab states-have called for their lifting. But with Unscom out of action, it will become ever harder for the Americans to argue that the unending embargo is designed to enforce the internationally accepted aim of arms control, rather than to serve America's and Britain's interest in keeping Mr Hussein (together with the unfortunate Iraqi people) contained in a cage. Iraq has complained that Arab foreign ministers delayed a meeting to discuss the situation at the behest of such good American allies as Saudi Arabia. They are unlikely to delay for ever.  1999 ISRAEL'S parliament, the Knesset, having deposed Binyamin Netanyahu and dissolved itself, has now decided on a ludicrously long election campaign of nearly five months. The vote will take place on May 17th, with the likely run-off vote for prime minister to be held on June ist. 
The decision to drag it out-the law allows for an election within two monthscame in consultations this week between Mr Netanyahu's Likud and the opposition Labour Party, led by Ehud Barak. Both are seriously rattled by the meteoric rise to the top of the opinion polls of Amnon LipkinShahak, the recently retired army chief of staff. Mr Shahak, blue-eyed and soft-spoken, has yet formally to declare his candidacy for prime minister, at the head of a new centrist party. But he is already attracting defectors from both the big parties, as well as promises of support from businessmen. Mr Netanyahu and Mr Barak both hope that Mr Shahak has peaked too soon and that a long and costly campaign will exhaust his appeal. 
Some in the peace camp, including Israel's convention-flouting president, Ezer Weizman, fear that Mr Barak (also a former chief of staff) and Mr Shahak will exhaust each other, with Mr Netanyahu reaping the benefit. But others argue that Mr Shahak's candidacy could help draw those traditionally opposed to Labour away from the Likud candidate in the first round. Then, if Mr Netanyahu and Mr Barak made it to the run-off, Mr Shahak would urge his supporters to back Mr Barak. If Mr Shahak got through, Mr Barak would obviously support him against Mr Netanyahu. And a strong showing by the centrist party in the vote for the Knesset, say the optimists, might give Mr Barak or Mr Shahak, if either won the prime ministership, the chance to set up a broad coalition without the Likud. 
Mr Barak's need to break down the old voting patterns has prompted him to offer a haven to Mr Netanyahu's former foreign minister, David Levy, one of the many politicians to have become unmoored in the storm.A month ago, Mr Netanyahu suggested that Mr Levy should return to the Likud, and to the cabinet, as minister of finance. But they argued, both over policy and over the reabsorption of Mr Levy's breakaway Gesher faction into the mother-party. Now Mr Levy, once a bricklayer and always a champion of the have-nots, has turned to Labour, saying that Mr Barak is ""the only candidate speaking clearly"" on social issues. 
Mr Barak hopes that Mr Levy's advent will persuade others in the Labour Party not to bolt for the centre-though the Labour air is thick with restless threats. In the Likud, the bolting has begun. Dan Meridor, whom Mr Netanyahu forced out of his cabinet a year ago, has left the party and announced his candidacy for prime minister as a centrist (he and Mr Shahak will eventually decide between them who will be the candidate and who the number two). And Benny Begin, also once a minister under Mr Netanyahu, has proclaimed a new party of the right, loyal to the Likud's nowcompromised belief in Greater Israel, with himself as its leader and candidate for prime minister. 
Mr Netanyahu is now desperately trying to dissuade the popular minister of defence, Yitzhak Mordechai, and the lone woman in his cabinet, Limor Livnat, from joining the centrists. He is also troubled by hints from the foreign minister, Ariel Sharon, his staunchest ally in recent months, that ""in special circumstances"" he would consider standing for prime minister. 
Mr Netanyahu is not done for yet. He surged from behind to defeat Shimon Peres in 1996, and this time he is both the underdog and the incumbent. His brand of raw rhetoric on the hustings and his manipulative skills should thrive in these conditions. 
But his failure to keep Mr Meridor and Mr Begin inside his depleted tent could prove fatal. These two, both princes of the Likud blood (Mr Meridor's father was a comrade-in-arms of Menachem Begin, the party's founder), and both widely respected for their honesty, will be pounding away throughout the campaign at Mr Netanyahu's weakest spot: his credibility. His way of winning power, and then holding together a creaky coalition for 30 months, has been to tell people, all people, whatever they wanted to hear. Now, with elections approaching, they are comparing notes.  1999 ISRAEL'S parliament, the Knesset, having deposed Binyamin Netanyahu and dissolved itself, has now decided on a ludicrously long election campaign of nearly five months.

His way of winning power, and then holding together a creaky coalition for 30 months, has been to tell people, all people, whatever they wanted to hear. Now, with elections approaching, they are comparing notes.  1999 HELL and heaven are separated by a 20minute drive along clogged streets. The centre of Angola's capital, Luanda, is a wasteland of piled-up rubbish, broken pavements and broken people; amputees from the war and its landmines beg at every corner. At the United Nations base on the outskirts of Luanda, freshly watered herbaceous borders run between rows of mobile homes. To keep the UN bureaucrats healthy and happy there are tennis courts and a swimming pool plus an all-American bar where beer can be bought only with dollars. 
The government blames this haven of peace for the resurgence of the country's civil war in early December, venomously attacking the UN Observer Mission in Angola for incompetence. It claims that, if the UN had been doing its job properly, Jonas Savimbi, the UNITA rebel leader, would not have been able to stockpile weapons when, under the terms of the 1994 Lusaka protocol, he should have been handing them in. 
They have a point. The UN's strategy was to make the most of the peace process in order to keep it going. UN officials regularly announced how many weapons had been handed in and how many soldiers and rebels were being demobilised at UN assembly points. No matter that many of the weapons were rusty and many ofthe UNITA ""soldiers"" at the centres were mere boys recruited a few weeks before. 
But if the UN failed to spot Mr Savimbi's shopping habits in the world's arms markets, it also failed to draw attention to the government's crude lack of interest in a true peace. In territory abandoned by UNITA, where people were desperate for food and medicine, the government instead sent in thuggish policemen who, without supplies of their own, stole the last local food stocks. 
On December 5th, the Angolan army attacked UNITA'S strongholds at Andulo and Bailundo in the central highlands. At the same time, the ruling MPLA party, holding its annual congress in Luanda, replaced many veteran members with more military-minded men. The shuffle clearly signalled all-out war: the party bosses were hoping to plant the government flag in the heart of the territory that Mr Savimbi once held. 
Most thought that would be easy. The rebels have no outside allies left. They are supposedly cut off by UN sanctions from both weapons suppliers and diamond buyers, and they have been weakened by attacks on their rear bases in Congo. But Mr Savimbi's forces proved stronger than expected and, by December 9th, UNITA was announcing that the government forces were in retreat ""having been beaten at their own game"". They were sent reeling as far as Kuito, which UNITA seemed on the point of seizing. Except that, at that point, the rebels ran out of petrol. 
Angola makes $2 billion-3 billion a year from oil, and UNITA usually has no difficulty finding supplies. This time, however, the rebels did not expect to find themselves advancing so fast. Like everyone else, they had overestimated government strength, and underestimated their own. 
This gave the government a chance to regroup. The rebels set about shelling Kuito and fierce fighting is reported in Bie and Huambo provinces. On December 26th a uN-chartered flight with four crew and ten UN officials crashed near Huambo. Both sides accuse the other of shooting it down. 
Four days after the crash, the UN'S special representative, Issa Diallo, was still trying to get a local ceasefire to allow a search mission to look for survivors. The government said the aircraft had come down in UNITA-held territory and so it was not their business. The rebels denied having received any request from Mr Diallo until late on December 28th. UNITA also says that the government is carrying out air strikes on its headquarters, making communication impossible. 
In short, neither side has shown the slightest interest in helping Mr Diallo look for the missing 14 people, let alone agreeing to a ceasefire or trying to work out a way of ending the war.  1999 The AIDS virus had infected 47m people, and shows no signs of slowing. It cannot be cured. Can it be curbed? 
IN RICH countries AIDS is no longer a death sentence. Expensive drugs keep Hv-positive patients alive and healthy, perhaps indefinitely. Loud public-awareness campaigns keep the number of infected Americans,Japanese and West Europeans to relatively low levels. The sense of crisis is past. 
In developing countries, by contrast, the disease is spreading like nerve gas in a gentle breeze. The poor cannot afford to spend $lo,ooo a year on wonder-pills. Millions of Africans are dying. In the longer term, even greater numbers of Asians are at risk. For many poor countries, there is no greater or more immediate threat to public health and economic growth. Yet few political leaders treat it as a priority. 
Since HIV was first identified in the 1970s, over 47m people have been infected, of whom 14m have died. Last year saw the biggest annual death toll yet: 2.5m. The disease now ranks fourth among the world's big killers, after respiratory infections, diarrhoeal disorders and tuberculosis. It now claims many more lives each year than malaria, a growing menace, and is still nowhere near its peak. If India, China and other Asian countries do not take it seriously, the number of infections could reach ""a new order of magnitude"", says Peter Piot, head of the UN'S AIDS programme. 
The human immuno-deficiency virus (HiV), which causes acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDs) is thought to have crossed from chimpanzees to humans in the late 19q.os or early 1950s in Congo. It took several years for the virus to break out of Congo's dense and sparsely populated jungles but, once it did, it marched with rebel armies through the continent's numerous war zones, rode with truckers from one rest-stop brothel to the next, and eventually flew, perhaps with an air steward, to America, where it was discovered in the early 1980s. As American homosexuals and drug injectors started to wake up to the dangers of bath-houses and needle-sharing, AIDS was already devastating Africa. 
So far, the worst-hit areas are east and southern Africa. In Botswana, Namibia, Swaziland and Zimbabwe, between a fifth and a quarter of people aged 15-49 are afflicted with HIV or AIDS. In Botswana, children born early in the next decade will have a life expectancy of 40; without AIDS, it would have been nearer 7o. Of the 25 monitoring sites in Zimbabwe where pregnant women are tested for HIV, only two in 1997 showed prevalence below lO%. At the remaining 23 sites, 20-5o% of women were infected. About a third of these women will pass the virus on to their babies. 
The region's giant, South Africa, was largely protected by its isolation from the rest of the world during the apartheid years. Now it is host to one in ten of the world's new infections-more than any other country. In the country's most populous province, KwaZulu-Natal, perhaps a third of sexually active adults are HIV-positive. 
Asia is the next disaster-in-waiting. Already, 7m Asians are infected. India's 930m people look increasingly vulnerable. The Indian countryside, which most people imagined relatively AIDs-free, turns out not to be. A recent study in Tamil Nadu found over 2% of rural people to be Hiv-positive: 500,ooo people in one of India's smallest states. Since lO% had other sexually transmitted diseases (STDS), the avenue for further infections is clearly open. A survey of female STD patients in Poona, in Maharashtra, found that over 9o% had never had sex with anyone but their husband; and yet 13.6% had HIv. China is not far behind. 
No one knows what AIDS will do to poor countries' economies, for nowhere has the epidemic run its course. An optimistic assessment, by Alan Whiteside of the University of Natal, suggests that the effect of AIDS on measurable GDP will be slight Even at high prevalence, Mr Whiteside thinks it will slow growth by no more than o.6% a year. This is because so many people in poor countries do not contribute much to the formal economy. To put it even more crudely, where there is a huge oversupply of unskilled labour, the dead can easily be replaced. Some people argue that those who survive the epidemic will benefit from a tighter job market. After the Black Death killed a third of the population of medieval Europe, labour scarcity forced landowners to pay their workers better. 
Other researchers are more pessimistic. AIDS takes longer to kill than did the plague, so the cost of caring for the sick will be more crippling. Modern governments, unlike medieval ones, tax the healthy to help look after the ailing, so the burden will fall on everyone. And AIDS, because it is sexually transmitted, tends to hit the most energetic and productive members of society. A recent study in Namibia estimated that AIDS cost the country almost 8% of GNP in 6. Another analysis predicts that Kenya's GDP will be 14.5% smaller in zoos than it would have been without AIDS, and that income per person will be lo% lower. 
The cost of the disease 
In general, the more advanced the economy, the worse it will be affected by a large number of AIDS deaths. South Africa, with its advanced industries, already suffers a shortage of skilled manpower, and cannot afford to lose more. In better-off developing countries, people have more savings to fall back on when they need to pay medical bills. Where people have health and life insurance, those industries will be hit by bigger claims. Insurers protect themselves by charging more or refusing policies to HIVpositive customers. In Zimbabwe, life-insurance premiums quadrupled in two years because of AIDS. Higher premiums force more people to seek treatment in public hospitals: in South Africa, HIV and AIDS could account for between 35% and 84% of public-health expenditure by zoos, according to one projection. 
Little research has been done into the effects of AIDS on private business, but the anecdotal evidence is scary. In some countries, firms have had to limit the number of days employees may take off to attend funerals. Zambia is suffering power shortages because so many engineers have died. Farmers in Zimbabwe are finding it hard to irrigate their fields because the brass fittings on their water pipes are stolen for coffin handles. In South Africa, where employers above a certain size are obliged to offer generous benefits and paid sick leave, companies will find many of their staff, as they sicken, becoming more expensive and less productive. Yet few firms are trying to raise awareness of AIDS among their workers, or considering how they will cope. 
In the public sector, where pensions and health benefits are often more generOUS, AIDS could break budgets and hobble the provision of services. In South Africa, an estimated 15% of civil servants are HIVpositive, but government departments have made little effort to plan for the coming surge in sickness. Education, too, will suffer. In Botswana, 2-5% of teachers die each year from AIDS. Many more take extended sick leave. 
At a macro level, the impact of AIDS is felt gradually. But at a household level, the blow is sudden and catastrophic. When a breadwinner develops AIDS, his (or her) family is impoverished twice over: his income vanishes, and his relations must devote time and money to nursing him. Daughters are often forced to drop out of school to help. Worse, HIV tends not to strike just one member of a family. Husbands give it to wives, mothers to babies. This correspondent's driver in Kampala lost his mother, his father, two brothers and their wives to AIDS. His story is not rare. 
Obstacles to prevention 
The best hope for halting the epidemic is a cheap vaccine. Efforts are under way, but a vaccine for a virus that mutates as rapidly as HIV will be hugely difficult and expensive to invent. For poor countries, the only practical course is to concentrate on prevention. But this, too, will be hard, for a plethora of reasons. 
Sex is fun . . . Many feel that condoms make it less so. Zimbabweans ask: ""Would you eat a sweet with its wrapper on?"" e.. . and discussion of it often taboo. In Kenya, Christian and Islamic groups have publicly burned anti-AIDS leaflets and condoms, as a protest against what they see as the encouragement of promiscuity. A study in Thailand found that infected women were only a fifth as likely to have discussed sex openly with their partners as were uninfected women. 
Myths abound. Some young African women believe that without regular infusions of sperm, they will not grow up to be beautiful. Ugandan men use this myth to seduce schoolgirls. In much of southern Africa, HIV-infected men believe that they can rid themselves of the virus by passing it on to a virgin. 
Poverty. Those who cannot afford television find other ways of passing the evening. People cannot afford antibiotics, so the untreated sores from STDS provide easy openings for HIV. 
Migrant labour. Since wages are much higher in South Africa than in the surrounding region, outsiders flock in to find work. Migrant miners (including South Africans forced to live far from their homes) spend most of the year in single-sex dormitories surrounded by prostitutes. Living with a one-in-4o chance of being killed by a rockfall, they are inured to risk. When they go home, they often infect their wives. 
War. Refugees, whether from genocide in Rwanda or state persecution in Myanmar, spread Hiv as they flee. Soldiers, with their regular pay and disdain for risk, are more likely than civilians to contract HIV from prostitutes. When they go to war, they infect others. In Africa the problem is dire. In Congo, where no fewer than seven armies are embroiled, the government has accused Ugandan troops (which are helping the Congolese rebels) of deliberately spreading AIDS. Unlikely, but with estimated HIV prevalence in the seven armies ranging from so% for the Angolans to an incredible 80% for the Zimbabweans, the effect is much the same. 
Sexism. In most poor countries, it is hard for a woman to ask her partner to use a condom. Wives who insist risk being beaten up. Rape is common, especially where wars rage. Forced sex is a particularly effective means of Hiv transmission, because of the extra blood. 
Drinking. Asia and Africa make many excellent beers. They are also home to a lot of people for whom alcohol is the quickest escape from the stresses of acute poverty. Drunken lovers are less likely to remember to use condoms. 
How to fight the virus 
Pessimists look at that list and despair. But three success stories show that the hurdles to prevention are not impossibly high. 
First, Thailand. One secret of Thailand's success has been timely, accurate information-gathering. HIV was first detected in Thailand in the mid-198os, among male homosexuals. The health ministry immediately began to monitor other high-risk groups, particularly the country's many heroin addicts and prostitutes. In the first half of 1988, HIV prevalence among drug injectors tested at one Bangkok hospital leapt from 1% to 30%. Shortly afterwards, infections soared among prostitutes. 
The response was swift. A survey of Thai sexual behaviour was conducted. The results, which showed men indulging in a phenomenal amount of unprotected commercial sex, were publicised. Thais were warned that a major epidemic would strike if their habits did not change. A ""100% condom use"" campaign persuaded prostitutes to insist on protection 90% of the time with non-regular customers. 
By the mid-199os, the government was spending $8om a year on AIDs education and palliative care. In 1990-93, the proportion of adult men reporting non-marital sex was halved, from 28% to 15%; for women, it fell from 1.7% to 0.4%. Brothel visits slumped. Only lO% of men reported seeing a prostitute in 1993, down from 22% in 199o. Among army conscripts in northern Thailand, a group both highly sexed and well-monitored, the proportion admitting to paying for sex fell from 57% in 1991 to 24% in 1995. The proportion claiming to have used condoms at their last commercial entanglement rose from 61% in 1991 to 93% in 1995. 
People lie about sex, so reported good behaviour does not necessarily mean actual good behaviour. But tumbling infections suggest that not everyone was fibbing. The number of sexually transmitted diseases reported from government clinics fell from over 4oo,ooo in 1986 to under 50,ooo in 1995. Among northern conscripts, Hrv prevalence fell by half between 1993 and 1995, from over 7% to under 3.5%. 
Most striking was the government's success in persuading people that they were at risk long before they started to see acquaintances die from AIDS. There was no attempt to play down the spread of HIV to avoid scaring off tourists, as happened in Kenya. Thais were repeatedly warned of the dangers, told how to avoid them, and left to make their own choices. Most decided that a long life was preferable to a fast one. 
Second, Uganda Thailand shows what is possible in a well-educated, fairly prosperous country. Uganda shows that there is hope even for countries that are poor and barely literate. President Yoweri Museveni recognised the threat shortly after becoming president in 1986, and deluged the country with anti-AIDs warnings. 
The key to Uganda's success is twofold. First, Mr Museveni made every government department take the problem seriously, and implement its own plan to fight the virus. Accurate surveys of sexual behaviour were done for only $20,ooo-30,ooo each. Second, he recognised that his government could do only a limited amount, so he gave free rein to scores of non-governmental organisations (NGos), usually foreign-financed, to do whatever it took to educate people about risky sex. 
The Straight Talk Foundation, for example, goes beyond simple warnings about AIDS and deals with the confusing complexities of sex. Its staff run role-playing exercises in Uganda's schools to teach adolescents how to deal with romantic situations. Its newsletter, distributed free, covers everything from nocturnal emissions to what to do if raped. Visiting AIDS workers from South Africa and Zimbabwe asked the foundation's director, Catharine Watson, how she won government permission to hand out such explicit material, and were astonished to hear that she had not felt the need to ask. 
The climate of free debate has led Ugandans to delay their sexual activity, to have fewer partners, and to use more condoms. Between 1991 and 1996, HIV prevalence among women in urban ante-natal clinics fell by half, from roughly 30% to 15%. 
Third, Senegal. If Uganda shows how a poor country can reverse the track of an epidemic, Senegal shows how to stop it from taking off in the first place. This West African country was fortunate to be several thousand miles from HIS origin. In the mid-i98os, when other parts of Africa were already blighted, Senegal was still relatively AIDs-free. In concert with non-governmental organisations and the press and broadcasters, the government set up a national AIDs-control programme to keep it that way. 
In Senegal's brothels, which had been regulated since the early 1970s, condom use was firmly encouraged. The country's blood supply was screened early and effectively. Vigorous education resulted in 95% of Senegalese adults knowing how to avoid the virus. Condom sales soared from 800,000 in 1988 to 7m in 1997. Senegalese levels of infection have remained stable and low for a decade-at around 1.2% among pregnant women. 
Contrast these three with South Africa. On December ist, World AIDS Day, President Nelson Mandela told the people of KwaZulu-Natal that HIV would devastate their communities if not checked. The speech was remarkable not for its qualityMr Mandela is always able to move audiences-but for its rarity. Unlike Mr Museveni, South Africa's leader seldom uses his authority to encourage safer sex It is a tragic omission. Whereas the potholed streets of Kampala are lined with signs promoting fidelity and condoms, this correspondent has, in eight months in South Africa, seen only two anti-AIDs posters, both in the UN'S AIDS office in Pretoria. 
How to dither and die 
South Africa has resources and skills on a scale that Uganda can only marvel at. It even has an excellent AIDs prevention plan, accepted by the new cabinet in 1994. But the plan was never implemented. The government likes to consult every conceivable ""stakeholder"", so new plans are eternally drafted and redrafted. Local authorities cannot act without orders from the central government. NGOS, many of them dependent on the powers-that-be for their finance, waste months making sure that enough of their senior management posts are filled with blacks to satisfy the ruling African National Congress. And they have minimal freedom to experiment. 
""There's an idea that if you disagree with the government, you are betraying the liberation struggle,"" says Mary Crewe, head of the Greater Johannesburg AIDS project. As a result, soldiers in the South African army are so ignorant that they snip the tips off their free condoms, and HIV has spread through South Africa as fast, according to Dr Neil McKerrow of Grey's Hospital in Pietermaritzburg, as if no preventive measures at all had been taken. 
Such bungling is not unique to South Africa. Most governments have been slow to recognise the threat from AIDS. From Bulawayo to Beijing, apathy and embarrassment have hamstrung preventive efforts. 
In anarchic countries, such as Congo and Angola, there have been almost no preventive efforts. Many people believe that the cause-a bid to restrain one of the most basic human instincts-is hopeless. As a Zimbabwean novelist, Chenjerai Hove, puts it with disturbing fatalism: ""Since our women dress to kill, we are all going to die."" But if the sexual drive is basic, so is the desire to live. If governments in poor countries wake up to the need to persuade their citizens that unprotected sex is Russian roulette, Mr Hove could be proved wrong. 
This article is indebted to a number of UNAIDS reports, including AIDS epidemic update (December i998, AIDS in Africa (November i9981 and ""A measure of success in Uganda (May 1998).  1999 1999 will not be just the year the euro was born. With Germany presiding for the next six months, the European Union has a host of other challenges 
JUST as well that the current crop of European Union leaders managed to rub along easily enough at their pre-Christmas summit in Vienna. They will be seeing a great deal more of one another in the year ahead, and in more trying circumstances. Vienna was a holding operation. Difficult questions were left for tackling at further summits in the course of 1999. Now several crunches are coming. 
The main event written into European diplomatic diaries for the first half of 1999 is a special summit in Brussels on March 24th and 25th. Here the 15 national leaders, and the European Commission as their servant, will try to reach agreement on new rules to limit EU spending from 2000 to 2006. All agree that budget reforms are essential, if the EU is to start admitting poorer countries from Central and Eastern Europe within that period. Without reforms, expansion will entail huge new spending obligations. But there are fierce differences of opinion over exactly what changes to make. 
Nobody is quite satisfied with ""Agenda 2000"", the package of tweaks and trims proposed by the commission as the basis for argument. France wants to keep farm subsidies high: it claims they are part of the Eu's ""spirit and heritage"", though the real point is that France happens to be their main beneficiary. Spain opposes cuts in regional subsidies with much the same logic. Germany wants its net contribution of $13 billion to the EU budget to be cut by at least a third. Britain wants to protect the special rebate mechanism won 15 years ago by Margaret Thatcher. Eight countries think that EU spending, roughly $100 billion in 1998, should be frozen in real terms for the foreseeable future, whereas seven are opposed or undecided. 
The main work of finding a compromise in all this will bear on Germany, which holds the Union's presidency during the first half of 1999. The timing is awkward: Germany's new Social DemocraticGreen government is still unsteady on its feet, and prone to send out erratic signals. Some countries doubt that the March deadline for a budget deal can be met, however diligent the presidency's work. 
But Germany's top diplomat in Brussels, Dietrich von Kyaw, refuses even to contemplate a postponement. He fears that failure to reach agreement in March would further set back the already much-delayed business of enlargement. He thinks the impression of a serious row among governments might rock the EU's new-born currency, the euro. And he doubts that they would be more accommodating if given more time. All countries, he says, ""will have to give up certain things to which we have become accustomed, things we feel entitled to get"" And lest finance ministers and foreign ministers appear unequal to the sacrifice, there were mutterings in Vienna about holding yet another meeting of heads of government in Bonn in February, before the Brussels summit, though Germany hopes this ""mini-summit"" will not be necessary. 
If a deal on Agenda 2000 can be reached in March, EU leaders will be spared one another's company until June. That is when they assemble in Cologne for a summit rounding off the German presidency. The agenda is likely to include the adoption of a largely symbolic ""employment pact"" for Europe, an idea pushed hard by France. The Union's leaders may well choose a new president for the European Commission and a new ""high representative"" for foreign policy(see page 48). 
But another item pencilled in for the Cologne agenda may give rise to yet another special summit-to convene a new and certainly gruelling ""inter-governmental conference"" for tidying up the EU'S constitutional arrangements. Finland, which assumes the Union's presidency on July ist, has indicated its readiness to play host to the launch of such a conference in the second half of 1999-hoping, no doubt, that a new constitutional shindig might proceed with more gusto than the one that dragged ineffectually along in the run-up to the Amsterdam summit of 1997. 
As with the financial reforms proposed in Agenda 2000,the constitutional reforms would prepare the way for enlarging the Union. If and when more countries join, for example, a new formula will be needed to fix the number of European commissioners (whose job it is to propose legislation and to run the Eu bureaucracy). The present system, whereby big countries send two commissioners to Brussels and small countries one, means an over-generous 20 commissioners already. Another area for reform concerns the Council of Ministers: countries will have to accept the wider use of majority voting there, if legislation is not to be blocked wholesale by a proliferation of national vetoes. New rules are also needed to make the voting power of each country in the council more proportionate to its size: the present system gives small countries a disproportionately big say. 
All this is delicate business. Other potential sources of tension ahead include a worsening trade row with America (sparked by an argument about bananas); the possibility of renewed fighting in Kosovo; and the pursuit, at Germany's insistence, of more effective tax ""harmonisation"" across Europe. Add to this the arrival of the euro, and elections for the European Parliament in mid-June: the implication is that EU issues will dominate national agendas in 1999 in a way not seen since the signing of the Maastricht treaty almost eight years earlier. So when the Union's leaders assemble yet again, in December in Helsinki to mark the end of the Finnish presidency, do not be surprised if their smiles look just a little strained.  1999 ARUSSIAN'S mental map of the world paints America large and everywhere else small. The United States counts for most in high matters-diplomacy and finance-as well as practical ones: the dollar, for example, is Russians' best-trusted currency for saving and commerce. Though Germany counts for a lot, Western Europe as an entity has never engaged Russian attention. 
Could this be changing? Certainly the European Union has never mattered more to Russian policymakers. The hottest topic is trade. The EU is already Russia's biggest single trading partner, with about 40% of the total. Now Russian exporters want to use the rouble's collapse (by more than two-thirds since August) to sell as much cheap steel, textiles, paper and so on to Western Europe as possible. But they are intimidated by the bureaucracy and protectionism of Brussels. So the government is lobbying on their behalf, with mixed success. ""It would be easier to push the Russians' case on steel if they had fully taken up their existing quota,"" sniffs a sympathetic Eurocrat. 
Russians also fear that EU protectionism may squeeze them out of markets in those bits of the former Soviet empire, such as Poland, now bent on joining the EU. ""There will be direct or indirect pressure for big contracts to go to western suppliers, not eastern ones,"" worries a Russian involved in trade finance. 
The Eu's expansion also has a political price. Central European countries are toughening visa regimes and customs services, making it harder for Russians to go and do business there. If Slovakia, Lithuania and Latvia also join the EU, Russia's remaining influence in the region would be pushed back still farther. 
But there are compensations. Russia sees the Eu as more sympathetic than America: just as rich, but less driven by superpower thinking. ""Europe is a better partner for us, less demanding,"" says Vladimir Ryzhkov, a rising young politician. European socialists' carping at the supposedly heartless policies inflicted on Russia by American neo-liberals strikes a melodious chord in Russian ruling circles. 
Still, for all their talk of a ""missing social dimension"", European governments are still likely to take their cue from Washington when it comes to another bail-out for Russia-of which there is currently no sign. The EU'S own efforts have been mostly unimpressive. The most recent idea, $5oom in food aid, has been a blatantly self-interested move by Europe's farm lobby. Most other EU aid so far has been technical advice, often not followed, and valuable chiefly to the well-paid western consulting firms that deliver it. 
But even this may be changing a bit. The European Parliament is reviewing the technical-aid budget. Lobbying by Germany and Finland, among others, has delayed the food-aid package. There are signs of a new emphasis on dealing with the Russian regions, especially those closest to Western Europe, such as Smolensk. When Finland takes over the EU'S presidency in mid-1999, it will launch a ""northern dimension"", aimed at giving greater oomph to Eu engagement in the Baltic states and north-western Russia. 
For most Russians, the biggest practical change will be the euro. Russian importers and exporters are waking up to the need to keep accounts in euros. When they become available in physical form, Russian savers may start hedging their currency exposure, by stuffing their mattresses with euros as well as greenbacks. Those who move cash in suitcases are especially pleased: the 50o note (worth around $425), they note with approval, will be much handier than four or five of those rather inadequate $too notes.  1999 Gerhard Schroder, the new chancellor, has profited from a row with a colleague to start asserting his authority 
WHEN Gerhard Schroder lets slip a beam of quiet triumph these days, the chances are someone has mentioned Jurgen Trittin. How so? Isn't Mr Trittin the Green environment minister at the centre of a row over atomic power that some pundits claim might even split the coalition with Mr Schroder's Social Democrats? 
So he is. But Mr Trittin has also, more or less unwittingly, given the chancellor an ideal chance to show who is boss. And Mr Schroder, widely deemed indecisive since he took over two months ago, has seized it with relish. Hitherto most of his problems have been with his own party and its powerful chairman, Oskar Lafontaine, who is also finance minister. The Greens are much easier to use as a whipping-boy. 
At first glance, the coalition's nuclear scrap may seem odd. After all, both partners, unlike the previous centre-right government under Helmut Kohl, are pledged to shut down all 19 of Germany's atomic plants, which generate about a third of the country's electricity. But, crucially, they differ on timing and tactics. The Social Democrats have said that, given the political will, Germany could be nuclear-free in ten years; the Greens say five years, and threaten footdraggers with penalties. 
Not so Mr Schroder and the economics minister, Werner Muller, a non-party energy expert. They want the phasing-out to be done with the consent of industry. It would then take much longer than the hardliners believe. Otherwise the government might be hit by demands for vast compensation, not just from the domestic nuclear industry but also from French and British firms with long-term contracts to reprocess German atomic waste. A messy confrontation in the courts could delay plant closures indefinitely. 
Hence a hush-hush meeting between Messrs Schroder and Muller with energy company supremos in Bonn on December 14th, when a long-term deal's outline was sketched. Under it, the utilities would close all nuclear plants by 2019, starting in the next year or two with some of the oldest, provided the government did not flood them with regulations in the meantime. 
The pow-wow not only further upset Social Democratic zealots who have long snarled that Mr Schroder, a former member of Volkswagen's supervisory board, is too close to the bosses. It also infuriated Mr Trittin, who was neither invited nor officially informed of the result, though he is directly responsible for nuclear matters. In an apparent tit for tat, he announced he was sacking the members of two committees responsible for reactor safety and radiation protection on the ground that they were too friendly to the nuclear industry. 
Now it was Mr Schroder's turn to be livid, or at least to seem to be. Out came a statement stressing that Mr Trittin had acted without consulting the chancellery, and that this was no time for ""pompous posturing and party political symbolism"". Old Bonn hands recalled no comparable public dressing-down of a minister since the last days of the centre-left coalition under Helmut Schmidt in 1982. Hence speculation that the Schroder coalition too might be almost on the rocks. 
Probably not. True, ridding Germany of atomic power is even more of a core issue for the Greens than it is for the Social Democrats; but that is exactly why they cannot afford to stomp out of the coalition. So after more huffing and puffing a compromise will probably be hammered out at coalition talks set for January 13th. 
At any rate, Mr Trittin's relations with Mr Schroder can hardly be ""damaged beyond repair"", as some claim. Soon after the chancellor's ""pompous posturing"" charge, the pair were spotted tucking into lunch together at a Hanover restaurant They are, after all, old allies as well as sparring partners, dating back to the early 199os when Mr Schroder was in his first term as premier of Lower Saxony and Mr Trittin was in his red-Green cabinet. 
What the row does show is how Mr Schroder is step by step trying to widen his room for manoeuvre, constrained since September by two events. The first was the election result itself, which gave an unexpectedly clear parliamentary majority of21 seats to a red-Green combination and boosted the influence of the Social Democratic left under Mr Lafontaine. The second was the coalition negotiation, which was too hastily rushed through and which Mr Schroder rashly left too heavily in Mr Lafontaine's acquisitive hands. 
Since then, to jeers of ""Where is Schroder?"" even from newspapers which had been hostile to Mr Kohl, he has been seeking to claw more influence. After a skirmish with Mr Lafontaine, he took away from the finance ministry responsibility for preparing the German position at the G8 rich countries' meetings and gave it to his own economic adviser in the chancellery. Responsibility for planning economic reconstruction in ex-communist eastern Germany has been centred on the chancellery too. And Mr Schroder's chief of staff, Bodo Hombach, has been co-ordinating the ""alliance for work"" talks between government, employers and trade unions to find jobs for Germany's 4m jobless. 
Like Mr Schmidt, Mr Schroder is trying to turn his chancellery into a combination of power-house and think-tank. Like Mr Schmidt, he is running into plenty of opposition from his own party, as well as from his coalition partner. But he is beginning to get his way.  1999 DOUBLE tragedy continues to unfold in Transylvania, the northwestern chunk of Romania that has been a haven for ethnic Germans for some eight centuries. First is the fast disappearance of an extraordinary cultural heritage, expressed partly by the medieval architecture that Germans (known in Romanian as ""Saxons"", though in fact they came from far and wide across the German-speaking world) brought to Transylvania and preserved for centuries against staggering odds. Second, the Germans are withdrawing from the mess that is today's Romania. This means the villages and small towns, which have been a mainstay of Transylvania's rural economy, are themselves falling into ever deeper penury and degradation. 
Some 250,000-strong in 1939, a good tenth of the Germans who survived the second world war were carted off-once the communists took over-to Russian labour camps: almost none returned. Around 180,000 Germans sat tight until the mid-1970s, when Nicolae Ceausescu, Romania's communist dictator, began to let a steady trickle go-at a hefty price in D-marks. Communism's fall in 1989 prompted a huge outward spurt. From 110,000, the number of Germans plummeted to 41,000 in less than two years. Now the figure has shrivelled again-to less than 17,000. The Saxon heritage could vanish. 
What is to be done? Take a little village like Viscri (which Germans still call Weisskirch)Once an almost entirely German hamlet of some 450 people, its population has stayed quite stable. But only 30-odd Germans are left-and the economy, based on farming in the lovely rolling plains around, barely exists. 
The squalor is striking. The village stands seven kilometres (four miles) from the nearest tarmac road. There is no longer a shop, bakery, clinic or garage. Rickety horse-drawn wagons far outnumber cars. There is no modern sewage system or running water. A filthy stream bubbles through the village's wide, rutted, muddy street. A telephone line was fixed up two years ago, but most of the skilled Germans (bakers, butchers, teachers, mechanics) who once kept things ticking over have gone. Fields of hops, once the village's main earner, have been abandoned. Gypsies-the butt of discrimination throughout Romania, and usually ill-educated people with scant farming skills-now count for more than half the population. Ethnic Romanians and a handful of Hungarians make up most of the rest. 
Viscri's glory is its stunning white medieval church (which gives the place its name) within a high-walled 12th-century citadel which-like 100 or so other such German fortifications in Transylvaniafended off Turks and Tatars as well as occasionally warring locals. The village's dynamic mayor, Caroline Femolend, an ethnic German, is trying to prod wellwishers outside Romania, including in the World Bank, to dip into their pockets. Otherwise, the village simply cannot survive-in human or architectural terms.  1999 DOUBLE tragedy continues to unfold in Transylvania, the northwestern chunk of Romania that has been a haven for ethnic Germans for some eight centuries.

Otherwise, the village simply cannot survive-in human or architectural terms.  1999 WHEN the European Union's accounts for any given year have been drawn up by the European Commission, and picked apart at length by the European Court of Auditors, they go to the European Parliament for final approval. Each year the auditors discover all manner of horrors in the accounts. Each year the parliament rubber-stamps them just the same. 
Hence the astonishment when on December 17th the parliament, angered by some ill-conceived prodding from the commission, voted to reject the accounts for 1996. The Socialists who dominate the chamber are arguing now for a vote of censure which, if carried, will oblige the entire commission to resign. 
Probably this vote will fail, as others have done before. But it is the first one to count as something more than a hopelessly empty threat. The parliament is growing in stature, thanks mainly to the powers given and promised it by the Maastricht and Amsterdam treaties. These include the power to approve (or not) the appointment of a new commission, and a de facto veto over the choice of president. And, decidedly, the parliament does not like Jacques Santer, the incumbent. The budget fiasco has probably been enough to end any hopes he might have had for reappointment when his term expires at the end of 1999. 
Not that Eu heads of government were likely to make Mr Santer, a former prime minister of Luxembourg, their first choice anyway. They want someone both tougher and (ideally) more taciturn. They will try to choose someone by June, when they meet for a summit in Cologne. The frontrunner is probably still Romano Prodi, a former Italian prime minister. Felipe Gonzalez, a former Spanish one, was once much-fancied but now looks over-embroiled in controversies back home. A more plausible Spanish contender might be Javier Solana, whose term as NATO'S secretary-general ends in 1999. 
A flurry of gossip in the autumn suggested that Germany might propose its finance minister, Oskar Lafontaine. This ranks as an improbable but thought-provoking idea. The first German to head the commission, Walter Hallstein, retired in 1967. A second German presidency is long overdue. If not Mr Lafontaine, another German could carry the day. 
One early piece of horse-trading already seems to have taken place. A Frenchman, Jean Lemierre, is about to be confirmed as the new president of the EU'S Economic and Financial Committee. This group of top officials from central banks, national treasuries and the European Commission, previously known as the ""monetary committee"", is one of the most powerful behind-thescenes bodies in the Union. Until recently, an Italian, Mario Draghi, was favourite to take over its presidency. Mr Lemierre's upset victory suggests a quid pro quo for Italy, in the form of an understanding that France will not oppose Mr Prodi's candidacy for the commission's presidency. 
But whoever takes over at the commission will have to gird himself (no she is in sight) for a tricky few years. It is an increasingly awkward outfit to run; power is drifting away from it. One practical inconvenience is a top-heavy structure brought about by the EU'S growth from six to 15 members. This already means an unwieldy ""college"" of 20 commissioners jostling for portfolios. A dozen more countries want to join the EU in the next few years. 
Any worthwhile reform will probably mean creating a hierarchy with a few ""super-commissioners"" on top and the rest as deputies or department heads beneath them. But how does one sell that idea to the countries that fail to get a super-commissioner of their own? How does one arrange for the top tier to be chosen on merit, and not by a lottery or quota system? Such internal issues will dog and may even consume the next presidential term. 
The next president will also find other institutions eroding the commission's power and influence. The parliament is one. National governments are another: politicians have mastered the possibilities of European integration to the point at which they, and not the commission, have become the real agenda-setters. Mr Lafontaine has shown as much in the case of tax harmonisation. The launch of the euro has also changed the balance of power profoundly. The Union's economic centre has become the new European Central Bank, which owes the commission no obedience whatsoever. 
The commission is about to be left on the margins of another new project: the development of a common foreign and security policy. The main role here will be played by a new ""high representative"", likely also to be named at the Cologne summit. (Delays on the part of France and others in ratifying the Amsterdam treaty, which provides the legal basis for an Eu foreign-policy apparatus, prevented a high representative from being chosen at the Vienna summit in December.) 
The new high representative will be accountable not to the commission, but to national governments grouped together in the Eu's Council of Ministers. Dick Spring, a former Irish foreign minister, is one plausible candidate. So too is Carlos Westendorp, a Spaniard who has been representing the West in Bosnia. 
It sounds an attractive job. When the world wants to know what ""Europe"" thinks about the latest crisis, the high rep will pop up on television to explain. If the European Parliament has its way, he will be the Union's champion of human rights. One day he may even have some real muscle at his disposal, if governments agree to give the Union more of a say in Europe's defence. 
Contrast that with the lot of Mr Santer's successor, who will have parliament breathing down his neck, the central bank refusing to catch his eye, and the foreign-policy figure treading all over his toes. As the heads of government deliberate over which grandee might be juggled into the commission, anyone whose name is being tossed into the air would be wise to wonder whether that prize is really the one worth having.  1999 Tony Blair insists that there is no comparison between the rows that forced Peter Mandelson and Geoffrey Robinson to resign and the ""sleaze"" scandals that bedevilled the Major government. Is he right? 
FROM the moment that Peter Mandelson resigned from his job as trade and industry secretary on December 23rd, the Labour government has been engaged in a frenzied exercise in damage limitation. The Mandelsonian misjudgment was to accept a 373,ooo ($630,ooo) loan from Geoffrey Robinson, a rich colleague, and then to keep it secret-even when his department was investigating Mr Robinson's business affairs. According to the Blairites, this is quite, quite different from the sleaze that engulfed the Tories. 
Does Labour protest too much? The various scandals that have so far beset Labour combine many of the elements that damaged the Tories (see box) But Labour argue that Tory scandals contained an extra ingredient-outright corruption. The most famous of these was the ""cash-for-questions"" scandal, in which some Tory Mps accepted money in return for asking questions in Parliament. This was certainly blatant misconduct, but Mr Mandelson's sin, too, was a huge conflict of interest. And Mr Mandelson is a much more central figure in the Labour government than any of the Tories caught up in the cash-for-questions affair-who had heard of Tim Smith, or Sir Michael Grylls or Neil Hamilton (who still denies the charges)? 
The sheer quantity of Tory scandal was also impressive. Twelve ministers were forced to resign over various misdeeds; and there were numerous indiscretions from backbench MPs, ranging from affairs with night-club hostesses to dubious business dealings. But even here Labour is doing its best. In the five years of the Major government, two cabinet ministers were forced to resign-the Blair administration has equalled that in a year and a half 
SEX Of the 12 ministerial resignations under the Major government, five were related to sexual behaviour. David Mellor (right) was the first of two cabinet ministers to go. Although the allegations that finally finished him off related to his acceptance of ""foreign hospitality"", it was lurid headlines about an affair (toe-sucking with an actress) that first put him on the ropes. A rash of other stories about Tories with mistresses or strange sexual tastes was especially damaging since Mr Major had championed traditional morality. Tony Blair's first cabinet casualty, Ron Davies (left), who resigned as Welsh secretary in October, was also brought down by sex. He was mugged after apparently cruising for gay sex in a London park. In the subsequent row two other cabinet ministers including Peter Mandelson were revealed to be homosexual. 
COVER-UP The other cabinet minister to resign during the Major years was Jonathan Aitken (right) He resigned to sue the Guardian newspaper after it alleged that he had allowed Saudi businessmen to pay for him to stay at the Ritz Hotel in Paris, whilst he was minister for defence procurement. Mr Aitken lost his libel action and now faces charges of perjury: Mr Mandelson's conflict of interest was initially much less obvious; he accepted a loan from Geoffrey Robinson when both men were still in opposition. It was only when his department began to investigate Mr Robinson's business affairs that trouble loomed. But while Mr Mandelson may not have lied, he did dissemble. He failed to tell the senior civil servant at the Department of Trade and Industry of his obligation to Mr Robinson; he fobbed off journalists who asked him how he could afford to buy his house; and he seems to have failed to tell the Britannia Building Society, from which he obtained a mortgage, about the loan from Mr Robinson. 
AND INFLUENCE PEDDLING Much of the aura of sleaze that surrounded the Tory party arose from its habit of accepting large, often secret, donations from dubious characters and foreigners. Asil Nadir (right), a businessman who subsequently fled Britain to avoid prosecution, donated f440,000 to the Tories; and the family of Ma Sikchun, who fled Hong Kong to avoid drug-running charges, also stumped up f im. But neither of these men bought immunity; Mr Nadir is still a fugitive and the Ma family accused the Tories of ""swindling"" them because charges against the senior Ma were not dropped. Labour's biggest funding scandal has centred on a respectable businessmanBernie Ecclestone (left), who runs Formula One motor racing. Unlike Messrs Ma and Nadir, Mr Ecclestone arguably got something for his Im donation. Shortly after the election the Blair government deferred plans to ban tobacco-advertising in motor racing.  1999 The economy 
Why are British interest rates so much higher than Europe's and America's? 
THREE cuts in interest rates, totalling 1.25 percentage points, brought some cheer to British borrowers in the last three months of 1998. But not all that much. Britain's official interest rates, at 6.25%, remain the highest of any large rich country (see chart on next page). America's Federal Funds rate is 4.75% and the eleven European countries adopting the euro will share a common official rate of a mere 3%. 
Yet Britain begins 1999 with the weakest economy in this group, except Japan's, according to the panel of forecasters polled monthly by The Economist. Indeed, a growing number of economists expect a recession. So why are British interest rates so much higher than those in America and euroland? The simplest answer is that the goal of central bankers is to achieve price stability, and that despite the relative weakness of the economy the Bank of England is still more worried than monetary authorities in other countries about inflation. 
The Bank's monetary-policy committee (MPC), which sets interest rates, has the explicit task of keeping ""RPIX"" inflation (ie, excluding mortgage-interest payments) at 2.5%. Throughout 1998, it fretted that Britain's labour market was tight. There is also the risk that sharper cuts in interest rates would weaken sterling, raising the inflation rate through higher import prices. The pound's 9% drop against the D-mark from its peak in March in effect eased monetary policy a little-the reverse of the role played before then by an appreciating pound. 
Indeed, inflation in Britain has remained higher than elsewhere. It is certainly remarkably low by the country's past standards, the more so after a long economic expansion. Currently RPIX inflation is 2.5%, on target. But American inflation, despite seven years of strong economic growth, is only 1.5%. In Germany, inflation is o.7% and in France a mere o.3%. 
International differences in current inflation rates, however, explain less than you might think. Even by the standards of economic data, they are imprecise, thanks to differences in the measurement of inflation. America's inflation rate has been trimmed by statistical refinements in recent years far more than has Britain's. And on the Eu-wide harmonised index of consumer prices, the gap between British inflation and those of France and Germany is smaller than on national measures. The British rate is 1.4%, compared with 0.2% in France, o.6% in Germany and an average of o.9% in the euro-11. 
More important, however, current inflation rates matter far less to monetarypolicy makers than does expected inflation. The MPC, for example, sets rates with an eye to hitting its target two years ahead. So the nz PC must believe that deeper cuts in interest rates would have risked pushing inflation above target in two years' time. 
There is, however, another possible reason why the Bank has not gone further in cutting rates: inertia. Financial markets see few inflationary dangers in Britain: tenyear government-bond yields are within a point of France's and Germany's, and below America's. In effect, the Mpc has already revised its expectation of inflation, and reduced rates accordingly, three times in the past three months. Most economists expect more revisions in the months ahead. 
In a recent lecture Charles Goodhart, a member of the MPC, argued that central banks were slow to react to changes in economic events, preferring to cut rates in small steps. They were also, he said, sometimes loth to move rates for fear of having to change their minds later. Yet in 1998 America's Federal Reserve cut rates as the global economic weather darkened, even though the domestic economy was still growing healthily. Europe's central bankers surprised the markets by cutting rates last month. Either or both may turn out to have been too eager. Should Britain's central bankers also have been bolder? 
Perhaps; and they might yet be. Most economists expect more rate cuts soon (even if not at the MPC'S next meeting on January 6th-7th). And there is an intriguing discussion in the minutes of last month's gathering, published on December 23rd. Some committee members thought it ""useful"" to consider a ""neutral"" interest rate, which would neither slow the economy nor expand it. Such a rate, they suggested, could lie anywhere between 4.5% and 6.5%-ie, the sum of expected inflation of about 2.5% and a real interest rate of between 2% and 4%. 
Others on the committee think the idea bunk, or at any rate too imprecise to be much use. How should the neutral rate vary with the exchange rate, say? Nonetheless it is noteworthy that British rates are still near the top of this ""neutral"" range with the economy on the edge of recession. Time to draw closer to both Europe and America?  1999 John Prescott needs to sharpen the financial incentives of Britain's privatised rail companies to stop passengers being taken for a ride 
THE ultimatum given to passenger-railway operators to improve their services or face the loss or curtailment of their franchises expires next month. Despite such threats made by the deputy prime minister, John Prescott, there are few signs of improvement. 
Extensive engineering works by Railtrack made travel over the Christmas and new year holiday period a nightmare. With punctuality declining and overcrowding worsening, passenger complaints continue to rise. 
All this poses a problem for Mr Prescott. He began a recent meeting with train operators by pointing out that for the past 18 months he had been able to blame the Tories. The next scapegoats were the train companies, good for perhaps another six months. But after that, he bellowed, ""the shit falls on me."" 
The deputy prime ministers dilemma can be summed up briefly. Does he return to a centrally run railway by imposing much tougher regulation on Railtrack and the train-operating companies? Or is he prepared to allow high profits in return for high levels of investment? The rail structure he inherited means that this choice cannot be delayed much longer. The appointment of the chairman of a new strategic railway authority, to be announced later this month, may provide a clue. Among those shortlisted is Sir Alastair Morton, whose record as Eurotunnel co-chairman shows that he can both knock heads and oversee high-risk operations. 
The Conservatives privatised the railways hurriedly and on the cheap. Though there was nominally a quality threshold, the successful train operators were those submitting the lowest bids for subsidy. As a result, Treasury support for the railways by 2oo4 will be about half the level prior to privatisation. That imposes a squeeze which requires rapid growth in passenger revenues as well as stringent cost cutting. The consequence has been overcrowding and declining punctuality. The task of delivering a satisfactory service is complicated by the split between track and train operations with both sides blaming one another for poor performance. 
The train operators claim that privatising the rail network as a monopoly has given disproportionate power to Railtrack. Shareholders' interests, they complain, have taken precedence over levels of investment, noting that the company's share price has quadrupled since privatisation. 
Railtrack, for its part, points out that it has improved its punctuality and reliability by 45% over the past four years while that of the train operators has deteriorated. Its chief executive, Gerald Corbett, argues persuasively that blame for poor performance is at least in part due to the misalignment of financial incentives. Railtrack, he points out, gains only marginally from increased fare revenues, thus minimising its incentive to invest. The train operators, on the other hand, have benefited so much from passenger growth that financial penalties for poor running have become insignificant. 
The first serious shot in this war was fired by the acting rail regulator, Chris Bolt, last month. Supporting complaints that Railtrack was investing insufficiently to justify its current high rates of return, he threatened to cap the fees it charges train operators for the use of its track. Railtrack immediately retaliated, saying that, if its profits were capped, this would have an immediate impact on its ability to raise capital. ""The key is getting new equity,"" says Mr Corbett. ""Our share price should be regarded as an asset rather than a problem."" 
Railtrack has some strong cards to play in what will be a lengthy negotiation. It has a key role in building the Channel Tunnel fast rail link and it is also a leading contender to take over the infrastructure contract for London Underground. ""Railtrack is Prescott's white knight,"" commented an industry observer. ""He knows he won't get any money out of the Treasury."" 
The government, however, cannot afford to allow a privatised monopoly a soft ride. With passenger numbers growing at around 6% a year to nearly 85om, the need to accelerate investment in track and rolling stock is urgent. Many commuter and peak-hour inter-city routes are now so crowded that passengers are having to stand for long periods, blocking any movement along the train. 
Railtrack says there are at least 30 serious congestion points in the network. This squeeze on capacity explains why punctuality and overcrowding are getting worse. But so far the company has been reluctant to commit itself to dealing with these bottlenecks, blaming the lack of incentives in its regulatory regime. 
In part, current problems are the problems of success. Train operators are running 1,ooo extra services a day while the number of passenger journeys has increased by nearly 100m in the past two years. Railtrack and the train operators are winning back custom from the roads. The question is: will they continue to do so, or will their squabbling bring Britain's rail revival to a screeching halt?  1999 MANY a marriage has come to grief even before the wedding day, as the happy couple and their families squabble over who to invite to the ceremony and the reception; over who will sit where; and over the choice and the cost of dresses, flowers, limousines, food, drinks and photographers. No wonder that increasing numbers of couples choose to get hitched in an exotic place far, far away from their relatives. 
No official figures are kept on the numbers marrying abroad. But Mintel, a market-research firm, estimates that in 1997 around 17,ooo couples went abroad to tie the knot. If so, that is one in 20 of all marriages of British residents. 
Exotic wedding-cum-honeymoon trips have become big earners for the travel trade: the Association of British Travel Agents' website lists 54 firms which claim expertise in arranging weddings abroad. Marrying at a Caribbean beach-side hotel is the most popular choice, though the weddings brochure of Airtours, Britain's second-largest tour operator, also offers the chance to exchange vows on a Canadian ski slope or in an underground cavern in Barbados. 
Whereas a traditional wedding back home typically costs at least L100,000 ($16,900) an exotic wedding abroad can be had for a supplement of a few hundred pounds on top of the cost of the honeymoon package tour. Often, the travel firm throws in many of the usual trimmings, such as a wedding cake and a bottle of bubbly, as well as some unusual ones: couples booking Airtours' wedding package in Jamaica get a massage and a ""commemorative T-shirt""; those choosing to wed at Disney World in Florida get their marriage certificate signed by Mickey and Minnie Mouse. 
To Richard Lampard, a sociologist at Warwick University who studies marriage, it is all part of a trend over several decades in which marriage has ceased to be a ""public institution"" and is now seen as simply a private contract between two people. The wedding ceremony itself is no longer regarded as the ""property"" of the local community in whose midst it is carried out. Increasingly, couples are marrying in their late twenties and paying for the wedding themselves, which means they are more likely to withstand family pressure to do things the traditional way-or to invite Auntie Maude.  1999 IT IS hard to sum up pithily the complex mixture of emotions generated by the dramatic Christmas resignation of Peter Mandelson, one of the chief architects of New Labour, secretary of state for trade and industry, and probably the most interesting (""exotic"" is his own word) man in Tony Blair's cabinet. It is hard, but it is not impossible. Bagehot's impression is that the reaction of many people-and certainly of most of political London-to the rude interruption of this gifted man's sparkling career can be broadly summarised as hahahahah. 
There is seldom a good reason to find pleasure in the misfortune of others. But there can be better reasons and worse reasons. In the case of Mr Mandelson's secret L373,000 ($630,000) loan from Geoffrey Robinson, the paymaster general, people need to sort out exactly what it is that they find so funny. The list is not comprehensive, but here, in descending order of acceptability, are four different flavours of hahahahah. 
It would be consoling to think that the most prevalent sort of hahahahah was the most highminded one, the one that says: ""This is a man who behaved dishonourably and was caught out."" Surely nobody can believe that anything other than self-preservation prevented Mr Blair's most intimate counsellor from telling the prime minister about his vast personal debt to Mr Robinson, once the paymaster general had become the subject of an investigation by Mr Mandelson's own department? Well, the peculiar thing is that some people-Mr Blair included-say not only that they believe him but have chosen to shower him with praise for having reluctantly resigned. And the depressing thing is that most of the people who do not believe him seem to be saying hahahahah for a different reason. 
This second sort of hahahahah has something to do with Greek tragedy. It is a not especially admirable human reaction to a tale of human frailty. Every so often it becomes the fate of a politician to prove all over again the adage that pride comes before a fall. Mr Mandelson was the perfect candidate. If, still knowing nothing about the secret loan he took from Mr Robinson, you had been asked in some pre-Christmas quiz to nominate a prominent member of the present government as a great man ripe for laying low, you would probably have selected Mr Mandelson. Famous for the exquisite sensitivity of his political antennae, he nonetheless made the elementary mistake of letting it be known that he considered himself very great indeed. Here was a man who made friends with Elisabeth Murdoch and Prince Charles but also made the nursing of grievances, the intimidation of journalists and the snubbing of the lowly into something akin to an art form. It is hardly high-minded, but perhaps not so terrible-and (be generous to yourself) maybe even healthy for democracy-to feel, instinctively: ""Hahahahah. He puffed himself up and was overdue for a comeuppance."" 
The third flavour of hahahahah holds some danger for British politics. This is the one that says: ""We knew all along that nothing good would come of this New Labour malarkey."""" Tories say this because Labour mounted a high horse and exaggerated the sleaze of John Major's government. But many traditional Labour people are saying it too, because they dislike many of the aspects of New Labour that Mr Mandelson came to symbolise. How delicious, they say, and how apt, that Mr Mandelson's fatal flaw was a craving to live beyond his means in a posh house at a fashionable address in London. This was the smart cosmopolitan who folded up the red flag and put a red rose in its place, who saw nothing wrong in people becoming ""filthy rich"", and who poked fun last summer at the idea that Labour owed a special debt to ""horny-handed, dirty-overalled people"". Well, just as Mr Mandelson did himself no good by putting himself in hock to the (filthy-rich) Mr Robinson, sohahahahah-no good will come from New Labour continuing to snub the trade unions and cosy up to big business. 
But this reaction has a fatal flaw of its own. It is at the very least based on a non-sequitur. In the matter of his house and loan, Mr Mandelson undoubtedly made a serious mistake. The man may be discredited, his style may be objectionable. But the policies with which he became associated-an end to class war, support for competition and flexible labour markets-have not been discredited at all. On the contrary. New Labour would not have won the last election if it had not ditched the discredited Old Labour ideas which those who rejoice in the exit of Mr Mandelson now see a chance to promote all over again. There are few such people within the government itself, but there are some. In his first interview after Mr Mandelson's resignation, Mr Blair made a point of warning potential revisionists that New Labour was bigger than any individual, and would resist any return to old policies. 
The Tories would love Labour to reopen these battles. One Tory spokesman claimed reports of a new alliance of pro-spending Keynesians between John Prescott, the deputy prime minister, and Gordon Brown, the chancellor, as evidence of the return of ideology to what had so far just been ""intense personal loathing"" between Mr Brown and Mr Blair. But this is wishful thinking on the Tories' part. Both Mr Brown and Mr Prescott see themselves as signed-up members of New Labour. Pardon the understatement, but they just don't like Mr Mandelson. 
And that, by the way, is the fourth flavour of hahahahah. It is the reaction of a handful of ministers and their spin doctors who continue to snipe at one another for no better reason than personal rivalry, and who say: ""Hahahahah, our enemy has fallen."" It is the unfunniest hahahahah of all.  1999 Northem Italy is studded with thriving clusters of manufacturing businesses. Why are they so vigorous? 
BEAUTIFULLY made goods from northern Italy are a part of la dolce vita from Hollywood to Hong Kong. Silk from Como, wool from Biella and gold from Vicenza adorn the fashionable, while on their noses perch glasses shaped and polished in the Dolomites. Ferrari, Ducati and Alfa Romeo are northern Italian names to quicken a motorist's heart. Tiles from Modena grace the grandest kitchens, and in those kitchens the famous cheese of Parma is grated on pasta prepared in the city's factories. 
These glamorous consumer industries are sustained by a second, less visible layer of activity. It consists of the firms that make the machines that make the famous products. Italy's group of machine-tool manufacturers, the bottom layer of the manufacturing pyramid, is the fourth-largest in the world after Japan's, Germany's and America's, with sales of $3.45 billion in 1997. Individual Italian machine makers tend to be small. The average size of the workforce in Italy's 450 machine-tool firms is 70, compared with 200 in Germany's 320 firms. According to Mario Fochi, of Sperotto Rimar, which makes textile-finishing machines, machinery makers spring up around the manufacturing firms like mushrooms amid the roots of big trees. 
Such delicacies are much sought-after among business theorists these days. Excited by the crackling commercial energy of Silicon Valley in California, governments around the world have tried to create their own Silicon Glens, Fens and Parks, Bio Valleys and Villes. They offer cheap buildings, infrastructure and tax breaks as a lure to entrepreneurs. The aim is to boost the productivity and creativity of everyone in the cluster by fostering opportunities for collaboration and the exchange of information, and a critical mass of expertise. 
Something in the air 
Northern Italy's long-standing clusters are proof of the value of collaboration. Elena Ferraro of IECO, which makes machines for melting and electroforming gold, underlines the importance of exchanging information with her customers. Of the firm's sales, 60% are within Italy. Most of those are of customised machines, rather than the off-the-shelf models and complete turn-key factories that IECO sells abroad. The need to keep up with the demands of the more sophisticated Italian goldsmiths has enabled Italian suppliers such as IECO, and nearby Sisma, to dominate their business, supplying about 80% of the total world market for machinery for making gold jewellery. 
Yet northern Italian clusters also contain a more surprising ingredient: the collaborators increasingly compete as well. Easier communications and trade mean that both manufacturers and machinery suppliers can more easily deal with each other's rivals across the world. 
The great fear among Italian industrialists is that this will weaken the country's clusters. Rather than use machines that might be sold to their competitors, some bigger firms prefer to rely on equipment from in-house workshops. Barilla, the world's largest pasta maker, has a 100strong engineering division. Proprietary machines propel every stage of its new lasagne line in Parma, from the floppy curtains of fresh dough dropping on to conveyors to the dealer that stacks the cut, dried sheets like so many playing cards. More important is the computer system the company has designed to control the line. Necessity has been the mother of some of this invention, for Barilla's dominance of its home market-it has 32%, compared with 4.8% for its nearest rival-means it operates on a larger scale than others, giving it needs that cannot be met with standard equipment. 
Other large firms are all too aware that their secrets would be at risk if the machines they use were widely available. Safilo, the second-biggest manufacturer of spectacles in the Veneto, with a turnover of 566 billion lire ($345m) in 1997, also has a research division. Fifty engineers design and build the machines that are humming away in the factory next door. Some of the systems developed within Safilo's workshop are patented-machinery to construct a particularly flexible hinge, for example. More often, the engineers modify standard machines that Safilo buys from outside. Vittorio Tabacchi, the chairman, laughs at the idea of asking the company's suppliers to modify the machines they sell him: that would reveal his firm's secrets and allow them to fall into the hands of competitors. 
Smaller firms do not have the luxury of using machines that are not sold to foreign competitors. Sperotto Rimar, Mr Fochi's firm, sprouted originally because of the sustaining presence in the region of Marzotto and Lanerossi, two textile firms that some 150 years ago found in the steep hills north of Vicenza fast-flowing streams to drive their looms, and sheep to provide wool. 
Today these two firms are one, which gets its wool from Australia and its power from the national grid, and its boss chafes at the restrictions a narrow valley places on floor space in his factory. The machinery in that factory comes from suppliers in other countries as well as its neighbourslooms from Switzerland, bobbin-winders from Germany, washing machines from Britain. Equally, 9o% of Mr Fochi's steam presses and shrinking machines go abroad-up from 6o% in 1985. Many go to Marzotto's growing number of rivals in Asia. Nuovo Pignone, a nearby loom maker that also supplies Marzotto, sold 7o% of its output in 1997 in Asia (and itself is being bought by a Swiss competitors 
Yet the increasing foreign trade also provides things that are good for clusters. Sisma, the world's largest producer of machines used to make gold chains, received 80% of its 30 billion lire ($18m) turnover from exports in 1997. ""Some Italian jewellery firms are unhappy that we sell machinery to their foreign competitors. But if we didn't, others would,"" reasons Fiorenzo Sbabo, Sisma's chairman. 
In this way, international sales prevent would-be foreign competitors from emerging. At the same time, the threat is a stimulus for innovation and the desire to move constantly upmarket. Italy has an edge in quality even in industries where other countries have obvious advantages. Its tile industry is one example (see box). Another is cashmere, which comes from China. Firms there have installed numerous Italian looms, as well as developing equipment of their own, but the finest cashmere clothes still come from Biella. The gap is narrowing, but Italy remains ahead. 
Similarly, South-East Asia dominates the mass market for spectacles, but Italy retains a lock on the top end of the market (where the profit margins are much greater: cheap glasses cost $4 to make and may sell for $15; designer glasses cost $12 and sell for $150). In gold jewellery, leather and tiles, likewise, Italy has hung on to the most lucrative part of the market, even as others have conquered its lower end. 
New technology has permitted the intimacy that used to be possible only within a cluster to take place over long distances. As a result, foreign customers have become a source of feedback in their own right. Flavio Radice, the boss of Pietro Carnaghi, a tool maker in Busto Arsizio, north of Milan, says he and his designers regularly use their video-telephone link to pore over plans with customers for the huge vertical-milling machines his firm makes for turbine builders. Some of these customers are to be found just up the road, part of the dense engineering conglomeration of this most industrious of towns, but others, such as Boeing Aerospace, for which Pietro Carnaghi has built a machine to shape the top of Delta-4 rockets, are in America. 
Nonetheless, there is an advantage in being local. Mr Radice's firm has built a suite of offices complete with a shower alongside its workshop. Customers like to come and spend several weeks consulting with the firm's engineers as their machines take shape. Being there still matters.  1999 TORTELLINI and Lambrusco pushed aside the usual machines and cutting oil last November when LB Officine Meccaniche celebrated 25 years of building machinery for making ceramic tiles at its factory on the outskirts of Sassuolo. There was every excuse for a blow-out: the firm's fortunes have risen with those of the Italian tile industry, which produced 572m square metres in 1997, compared with only 200m square metres in 1973. Over the same period exports have risen too, from 30% to 70% of total production. By egging each other on, both the tile makers and the machinery makers such as LB Officine Meccaniche that cluster together in Sassuo(o's ""tile valley"" have given themselves much to celebrate. 
Success has depended on innovation. LB Officine Meccaniche, for example, has developed systems for handling and mixing materials to make porcelain tiles that look like marble and granite, but are lighter and cheaper than the real thing. Tile makers elsewhere are catching up with the Italians. Ten years ago Spain's production was only one half that of Italy; now it is almost as large. Turkey's production is growing rapidly, and China's is already as large as Italy's. To stay ahead, the Italians must continue to innovatethe pressing concerns today are to reduce fragility and to make elaborate shapes in large quantities-in order to add more value to what is at bottom nothing more than cooked mud. 
Whether Italian tile makers can keep innovating is another matter. After the party, the strains of cluster life soon resurface. Angelo Bore]li, chairman of Assopiastrelle, the tile makers' trade association, says that his members and the machinery makers have a love-hate relationship. He complains that machinery makers sell foreign clients expertise that they acquired through their work in Italy. ""[We] would be much better off if the machines were not sold abroad,"" he grumbles. 
Nearly three-quarters of the machinery makers' 1997 turnover came from exports, with almost one-third going to Asia. But tile makers are getting their own back: problems in Asia have brought harder times for the machinery makers and, according to Filippo Marazzi, chairman of the Marazzi Group, Italy's top tile maker, a chance for their customers to buy cheaply by playing off suppliers against each other. 
Ivanno Ligabue, one of the founders of LB Officine Meccaniche, is uneasy for the region's future. He doubts that tile makers are doing enough to create new products and market them. But out of such insecurity the next wave of innovation is born.  1999 WITH a record like his, there is every reason to think that Lord Simpson, the managing director of Britain's General Electric Company(GEc, will play a big role in the reshaping of Europe's defence industry. Not that he entertains many grand designs himself he wants to pair off his Marconi defence arm with one of four potential partners, two of them in Europe, and two in America. 
When Lord Simpson was boss of Rover, the last big car company in British hands was clinging to life with the help of Japan's Honda, which owned a zoo% stake in the ailing but venerable firm. With a refreshing lack of sentimentality, he sold it to a German firm, BMW, before going on to run Lucas, a British car-parts company. Ere long that too went-to America's Varity. 
True to form, just before Christmas, Lord Simpson confirmed, in effect, that he was proceeding with the dismemberment of GEC, another British industrial institution, which had been built lovingly over 30 years by Lord Weinstock, who was one of the country's most respected industrialists. Lord Simpson had already floated the group's power-engineering joint venture, Alstom. His next move will be to split the civil and military sides of Marconi, its electronics and communications subsidiary, the better to sell or merge Marconi's main defence business. 
At the last count, Lockheed Martin and Northrop Grumman in America, and British Aerospace (sae) and Thomson-csF (French despite the name), were all in discussion with GEC The company confirmed just before the end of 1998 that a deal should be announced in January. 
Lord Simpson is lucky to be in a sellers market. Americans are interested because GEC is respected as a supplier to the Pentagon, and recently snapped up a smallish American company, Tracor, to strengthen its American business. Meanwhile, the European defence industry is poised for rationalisation, so that it can compete better with American giants such as Boeing and Lockheed Martin. Closest to tying the knot are sAe and DASA, the aerospace part of DaimlerChrysler. 
In many ways Lord Simpson might find a merger with Lockheed easiest, building on GEC'S good reputation in America. Or he could seek to become the third leg in the sae/DAsA group, but this would probably have to wait some time until the first two arranged their own deal and worked out a way for GEC to join without turning DASA into the junior partner. A third option would be to join Thomson, which the French government wants to strengthen and privatise. A Marconi-Thomson link-up would create a new powerful defence-electronics company every bit as prestigious as the sAe/DAsA group (which makes the aeroplane platforms that carry the military electronics). 
Whichever Lord Simpson chooses, he will be left with the rump of the industrial and consumer businesses of GEc-which includes such things as weighing machines, telecoms equipment, domestic appliances and medical devices. He would be unlikely to use them as a base for building a GEC Mark Two. So expect rather more disposals and handing back of cash to shareholders. Would the last person to leave GEC please turn out the lights.  1999 South Korean restructuring 
EVEN those who are leery of politicians meddling in industry sense a certain justice in the dressing down that South Korea's government is giving its giant conglomerates, or chaebol. Kim Dae Jung, South Korea's president, is not alone when he blames the chaebol's huge debts and overweening expansion for his country's eceonomic crisis. Yet, however much the chaebol need reining in, President Kim's row with the LG Group appears to be a miscalculation. On December 28th the government cancelled new loans to LG. If it were to go further and call in debts worth $5.6 billion, as it has threatened, it would destroy the firm. And to what end? 
The fight is over the government's plan for LG to merge its semiconductor operations with those of Hyundai. There is an arbitrary, almost numerological, dimension to this-as there is to Mr Kim's other industrial designs. Instead of three main chaebol in most big industries, the government wants two, with the weakest handing its operations to one of the stronger two. 
Ultimately, Mr Kim's aim is to lower the chaebol's soaring debts and to reduce overcapacity. The top five chaebol have already agreed to lower their average ratio of debt to equity to 200% by the end of 1999, from nearly 400% today. Not content for the chaebol to do this in their own fashion, the government is directing the restructuring with enforced swaps, which have come to be known as ""big deals"". With LG refusing to do Mr Kim's bidding, the president is using the state-controlled banking system to starve the chaebol of money. 
Sometimes, as with Samsung's car plant, born ofthe company's mis-timed entry into the car industry in 1998, the rationale for restructuring seems justified, even if the method is heavy-handed. (Samsung agreed to hand the plant to Daewoo in exchange for some second-rate consumerelectronics operations.) But the deal between LG and Hyundai does not even have the advantage of industrial logic 
The argument for the merger rests on the current overcapacity in memory-chip making-the plunging price of which in 6 caused the losses that first harmed the chaebol. Memory-chip making is a cyclical industry. Those that can afford to invest in new technology through the down cycles stand to make huge profits when prices rise. To prosper, therefore, all three South Korean chipmakers (including Samsung, the leader) need to invest huge amounts in 1999 (see chart), which will mean borrowing billions of dollars just when they are supposed to be lowering their debt. The government thinks one big firm formed out of the two smallest (together, iG and Hyundai would be the world's largest memory-chip producer) would enjoy economies of scale. The government hopes that it may also attract a foreign investor, which could take up to a 50% stake and help finance the new investment. 
When the government first dreamed up this scheme in September, LG and Hyundai unenthusiastically agreed, hoping they could find a way to scotch it. But the government pressed on, proposing a 70-30 jointly owned firm, with Hyundai holding the controlling share. When LG demurred, the government asked Arthur D. Little to study the question. After the consultancy confirmed the governments view, LG threatened to sue it. 
Arthur D. Little argues that, because the memory industry is so capital intensive, only the richest firms can survive. ""Secondtier companies like LG and Hyundai are very vulnerable to downturns,"" the firm says; ""Put LG and Hyundai together and they become top-tier almost overnight."" 
In fact the deal makes little sense. It is anyone's guess whether a merger will really do much to make investment more affordable. Bigger, financially sound companies do have access to cheaper capital, which is indeed a competitive advantage in memory-chip making. Yet the combined company would still have far heavier debts than chipmakers elsewhere. The government may force the banks to forgive much of this debt (swapping it for equity, for instance), but it could just as easily do this for the two firms separately. In any case, neither LG nor Hyundai is a tiddler even now, with 12-13% ofthe world memory-chip market each-more than their Taiwanese rivals. 
There may be modest savings in research spending, but the two firms specialise in different types of memory chip. The combined firm would presumably continue to invest in both. Their factories also use different technologies that cannot easily be integrated. And, as ING Barings, an investment bank, points out, a firm the size of the combined LG-Hyundai may be less likely to attract a large foreign investor. Buying a half-share of such a giant would be too expensive for most of the firms that are likley to be interested (Intel, the obvious exception, has already joined Micron, an American memory maker). 
The pity is that South Korea already has rules that could sort out chip making and most other industries without Mr Kim's good offices. The government has banned the sort of loans between subsidiaries that LG and Hyundai used to help get through rough patches in the past. Under the new restrictions, the credit market could determine which operations should merge or close. Could it be that Mr Kim is unwilling to see the lay-offs that would result from such spontaneous restructuring?  1999 BY ADDING an inch to every Chinese shirt-tail, Britain hoped to keep its t9th-century textile mills running. It failed, but the promise of 1.2 billion consumers still lures traders to China. Most are disappointed: China is still largely rural and achingly poor-the average income is just $360 per head a year. 
Yet the rise of an urban economic elite, mobile telephones in hand, proves that there are two Chinas: the huge nation of poor peasants who may never buy a Coke, and a thin layer of free-spending officials, managers and entrepreneurs who are only too keen to splash out. Affluent China today probably amounts to a small nation, barely significant in the global consumer market-but growing too quickly to be ignored. 
It is easy to overestimate the buying power of China's elite consumers. Together they represent no more than 3om people in cities such as Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou and Shenzhen. And for the most part, they are not rich by world standards: according to the latest official government survey, the top lo% of city dwellers have an average annual disposable income of just $1,24o a person. 
On the other hand, if GDP per head is adjusted for purchasing power, the incomes of the top io% of city dwellers is probably closer to $io,ooo a year. The prevalence of wide-screen televisions, fancy stereos and home-karaoke machines in Shanghai apartments suggests that this new upper-middle class has more money than it admits to. Supposing that the real wealth of affluent Chinese lies somewhere between the two estimates, China's potential market must be somewhere between those of Belgium and Australia. 
Put like that, China looks hefty, but not gigantic. But compare China today with China in 1985 (the first year the country conducted comprehensive consumer surveys) and it is clear that China's growth has been rapid. 
Among urban households, fewer than one in five households had a colour television in 1985; today the average such home has more than one. Then, 7% had a refrigerator; now 73% do. Cameras are four times more common. Among richer urban households, more than a half now have a VCR or video CD machine, a pager, air-conditioner and shower, and nearly a third of homes also own a mobile telephone. Every year, millions more Chinese join the ranks of this high-spending elite. 
After three years of declining growth rates (from an unsustainable peak of 4o% a year in 1995), consumer spending started picking up again in 1998 and should come close to matching the country's 7.8% growth in GDP for the year. China is already one of the largest markets for mobile telephones and pagers, personal computers and antibiotics, and accounts for about one-third of global cigarette consumption. All of these industries make lots of money for foreign firms. In boom towns such as Shenzhen and Shanghai, BMWS and Mercedes are now commonplace: after decades of deprivation, the urge to splurge is strong.  1999 SLOVAKIA has not had much to boast of in recent years, but it may produce the biggest corporate default in Central Europe since the collapse of communism. Creditor banks have spent the past few weeks shuffling the management of vsz, Central Europe's largest steelworks, and trying to reach a deal to restructure its debts. The company defaulted in November on a $35m loan arranged by Merrill Lynch, and it is reckoned to have further debts of around $45om that it cannot service. If there is no progress within the coming months, it will go under. 
This mess need not have come about. vsz, which accounts for 8% of Slovak GDP and 14% of Slovak exports, enjoys strong local demand from the booming Central European car industry. Daewoo and Volkswagen, whose Czech Skoda subsidiary is vsz's largest customer, need a range of specialist steels which vsz could be supplying. Although vsz is being undercut in western markets by producers in Asia and the former Soviet Union, in Central Europe it has geography on its side. 
But politics has undermined vsz's business. The usual post-communist problems of overmanning and slack management were exacerbated in 1995 when the company was sold for a fifth of its market value to supporters of the thuggish Vladimir Meciar, who was ousted as prime minister in October 1998. The largest shareholder is now Alexander Rezes, who handed management control to his son in order to run Mr Meciar's re-election campaign. Jan Smerek, head of the supervisory board, is a member of parliament in Mr Meciar's leftwing populist party. He led attempts to put together another Meciar government. 
Instead of investing in vsz's run-down plant, Mr Rezes decided that it needed to diversify away from steel. He bought a heap of companies including a financial newspaper, a football club and some holiday homes in Spain. Fortunately, his attempts to buy Slovakia's largest insurer and thirdlargest bank came to nothing. 
vsz is nowa large political constituency as well as a huge chunk of the economy. It directly employs 25,ooo people, and supports three times that number through its supply chain. Sean Murphy, a steel analyst at Nomura, an investment bank, reckons that the company needs only a quarter of its present workforce. But, he says, ""the company is being run for the benefit of its employees, not its shareholders."" 
When the new government came to power in October, it offered to rescue vsz if the management and supervisory board resigned. They refused. But now that the company faces bankruptcy, they have accepted some changes. Just before Christmas the creditors kicked out Rezesfils and put in two American managers, including Thomas Graham, the ""smiling barracuda"" who has a record of turning around steel mills. What next? Simplest would be to sell the plant to a western firm with plenty of cash and no political agenda.  1999 SLOVAKIA has not had much to boast of in recent years, but it may produce the biggest corporate default in Central Europe since the collapse of communism.

Now it is proving to be its undoing 
BRITAIN'S textile industry is in a mess. Like many of the country's basic manufacturing industries, the textiles business is suffering from falling demand, volatile input prices and the strength of sterling. Much more startling is that a sweatshop industry should matter at all to Britain, one of the world's most developed economies. 
With a workforce of some 354,ooo, textiles and clothing is the sixth-largest employer in British manufacturing-just behind mechanical engineering. Britain and Italy are by far Europe's biggest employers in clothing manufacturing. Though many of its ii,ooo or so textile firms are small and family-run, Britain is also home to some of the publicly traded clothing manufacturers with the largest sales in Europe. 
All of them are having a miserable time. Share prices in the textiles sector have underperformed the -rsE 100 share index by some gn% in the past five years, let down by thinning margins and, in many cases, declining profits. In 1994 Coats Viyella, the largest, was one of the 1oo biggest quoted companies in Britain. On December 21st it suffered the indignity of being demoted from Britain's top 350 companies to its SmallCap Index. Today, the values of Britain's 3o-odd quoted textile firms combined would be less than half that needed to enter the ranking of the top too. 
And things are deteriorating. Clothing sales in Britain are flat and retailers fear that worse lies ahead. Britain's largest and most profitable retailer, Marks and Spencer, recently spoke of a ""bloodbath"" on the high streets. 
The plight of Britain's textile companies has much to do with nM&Ss. In most countries, clothing manufacturers are branded companies in their own right. Many have their own retail outlets-Benetton and Stefanel in Italy, Hugo Boss in Germany, Donna Karan and Tommy Hilfiger in America. In Britain, it is the clothing retailers-MeAS particularly-that enjoy brand status. Consumers shop for and trust in Mas clothes, whereas manufacturers remain faceless. To keep the British public loyal to its ""St Michael"" brand, Mas has tied its main suppliers to its apron strings, encouraging them to keep factories in Britain and to concentrate on supplying M&S. 
There was a time when both Mtas and its suppliers benefited. M&S'S ""Buy British"" policy not only protected local jobs; it also helped boost sales. With short lines of communication to suppliers, the retailer could keep a better check on quality and was more flexible. It could change ranges more quickly than rivals who imported, and was the first to bring innovative materials such as wrinkle-free fabric to the British public. 
Companies that became Me^S's preferred suppliers grew rapidly on the back of its success. Investors rated the big fourCoats Viyella, Courtaulds Textiles, Dewhirst and William Baird, which together supply 60% of nMs,s's clothing-more highly than the rest of the sector. 
Unfortunately, such dependence on one customer has left these companies vulnerable. Some 90% of Dewhirst's business is with M&s, while even William Baird, the least exposed, still sells more than 40% of its output to the retailer. Because the strong pound has made imports cheap, their domestic factories now carry hefty costs. For m&s, too, a British supply base has fewer advantages: quite apart from their higher costs, British suppliers have no particular advantage in servicing the retailer's growing number of overseas stores more efficiently. Faced with falling demand, M&s is suddenly asking its suppliers to shift production abroad. 
Although some are obediently doing so, M&S suppliers are still suffering. Worries that M&s may have too much stock have caused their shares to perform even worse than those of the rest of the British textile industry. In the past two months, M&S clothing suppliers have cut almost 2,300 British jobs. Even so, the industry in Britain may still have 30% too much capacity. 
Mergers could help to reduce capacity in the industry, but few have occurred. In September Courtaulds Textiles bought Claremont Garments for a paltry fom ($17m) plus debt-a mere 5% of Claremont's annual sales. William Baird is trying to persuade a reluctant Coats Viyella to sell its textiles and branded-clothes business for a probable om, including debt. 
Depressed share prices are one reason for inaction: there are few wealthy predators around. Though Baird's plans make sense (not least because Coats has mismanaged its crown jewel,Jaeger women's wear), Coats is unwilling to demerge clothes from its thread business. Though Baird is one of the better-run groups, its market capitalisation of E7m is too small for it to make a bid for the whole of Coats, worth 192m. David Suddens, Baird's chief executive, is frustrated: ""What's the point in being a quoted company? I can't use our paper. Even banks are saying `Christ no-not the retail sector, not the textile sector.' No one wants to know."" 
Anyway, being bigger may not be the answer. Ron McDerment, a textiles analyst at HSBC Securities, a stockbroking firm, argues that good old-fashioned management matters much more. ""[This business] needs managers who can be two things at oncedisciplined cost cutters who can run a tight supply chain and creatives who can get designs and fabrics right."" Sadly, the textiles business finds it hard to attract and retain talent. Like the clothes at M&S, British textiles have lost their appeal.  1999 Economic liberalism is surviving trial by recession, according to the latest worldwide opinion poll by Angus Reid and The Economist 
HISTORICALLY, recession is the midwife of protectionism. In good times, peoples and nations are happy to enjoy the benefits of open trade. Come bad times, they are tempted to minimise short-run pain through protection. 
The great question now is whether the liberal policies that have taken hold in many countries around the world in the 198os and 199os can survive an economic setback. During 1998, such a setback threatened to grow from being merely regional into one that, in 1999, could be more or less global. The Asian ""tigers"" had suddenly turned pussycats in 1997, and in 1998 their recessions proved deep. The Russian economy stubbornly refused to reform itself, and the country defaulted on its debts. Long Term Capital Management, a hedge fund, went dramatically belly-up, prompting a private-sector rescue costing an estimated $4 billion. World stockmarkets turned sharply bearish in the early autumn. Forecasts for 1999 were for little or no growth, worldwide. 
Predictably, the voices ofthe protectionists were raised again. There were those who thought the blame lay in excessively free currency markets. George Soros, who had made his multi-billion-dollar fortune from such markets, published a book, ""The Crisis of Global Capitalism"" (Little, Brown L$17.99; Perseus Books $26, making this case. And there were those who wanted to guard domestic jobs against foreign competition or the pressures of foreign slumps. In both America and Asia, politicians began to raise the protectionist banner. 
Yet as far as public opinion is concerned, they have got nowhere. Amazing as it may seem, there has been no increase in popular support for protectionism worldwide over the last year (see chart on this page). An opinion poll carried out among more than 12,000 adults in 22 countries worldwide by the Angus Reid Group, a Canadian pollster, for The Economist shows that the proportion favouring protection did not change: at 48% last year to 47% this year, the fall is insignificant statistically. The conspicuous point is that the proportion of protectionists has failed to rise. 
The question asked was: ""Which of the following two broad approaches do you think would be the best way to improve the economic and employment situation in this country-protecting our local industries by restricting imports, or removing import restrictions to increase our international trade?"" This was designed to flush out true free traders. To count as one, a respondent had actually to favour lower barriers against imports and not merely to oppose the building of new barriers. It might therefore have been expected to understate the number of anti-protectionists. 
True, on this measure, protectionists do just outnumber free traders (47% to 42% worldwide) In particular, some Asian countries such as Malaysia remain strongly protectionist. Even in traditionally freetrading Asian countries, such as Taiwan, support for free trade has fallen. In 1997, free traders outnumbered protectionists in Taiwan by more than three to one. Now the ratio is two-to-one. 
But protectionism seems to be a lagging indicator rather than a leading one: in other words, bad times must come before it rises, rather than merely being expected to come. For support for free trade amongst the large, and still economically robust European Union economies-Britain, alas, excepted-has grown sharply. Even in Colbertist France, free traders are now only slightly outnumbered by protectionists. 
Nor has America begun to flinch. Not that the American dream of freedom has ever quite extended to international trade. A clear majority of Americans (56% to 37%) are protectionists even today. Yet over the past year, support for protectionism in America has hardly increased. 
The poll also sought to measure support for economic liberalism in a second way, by looking at countries' internal economic policies. Respondents here were asked: ""Which of the following would you prefer? More free and open competition between suppliers of goods and services, or more controls, subsidies and regulations from your government?"" 
Arguably, this question tends to encourage the liberal answer, just as the one on trade tends to encourage the protectionist answer. Even so, the support for competition-within living memory a dirty word to many-is impressive. 
Globally, economic liberals are in a two-to-one majority on this question. In North America, the majority is nearer to four-to-one. In Asia the liberals outnumber their opponents by more than two-to-one. They are now in a clear majority in Western Europe, and a majority, albeit not statistically significant, in Latin America. Globally the majority favouring competition over government control is down slightly compared with last year, by five percentage points. But it remains solid. 
Furthermore, the poll sought to explore a third dimension of economic liberalism: support for the free movement of capital. The question was: ""There's been some discussion recently about whether or not there should be tighter restrictions on the movement of money from country to country. Some say there should be tighter restrictions on this. Others say that is not necessary. What do you think?"" 
Risky capital 
Unlike the other two measures, we were not able to compare views on this with views last year. The question was only devised this year in response to emerging criticism of the workings of free capital markets. However, the results for 1998 are less encouraging for liberals than the results of our questions on trade. 
Worldwide, there is a clear preference for tighter controls. 49% favour them with 37% against. Some 14% don't know. 
Only in Spain and Italy of the 22 countries surveyed do a clear majority of people favour free capital movements. In Asia, liberal Hong Kong now produces only a fivepercentage-point margin against restrictions, and Japan only a two percentagepoint-margin. Public opinion in Indonesia, South Korea, Thailand, and to a lesser extent in Taiwan and China is heavily against free capital movements. 
How might liberals react to these findings? There is a clear majority preferring competition to planning and regulations as a way of running an economy. Opinion on protectionism is divided but it remains stable; resisting it is no harder than it has ever been. Opinion is, however, hostile to free currency movements if not overwhelmingly so. So one way of assuaging public opinion would be to act to curb free currency and capital markets, preserving free markets in goods and services. 
Quite apart from its potential economic costs, however, this would be a risky strategy. Protectionist sentiment has a habit of starting with specific plausible cases and then extending to the general. Once the case is conceded in one area, capital movements, there is no guarantee that a new line could be held. 
A more promising avenue might be to tackle instead what public opinion worldwide seems to see as a major weakness of the international economic order: the weakness of its principal international institutions. The worldwide standing of those institutions is deplorably low. 
Take first the International Monetary Fund (IMF) Its policy of forcing budgetary discipline and market-based reform on member-countries has had the broad support of most pro-capitalist economists, though the developing world has been less enthusiastic. But that support is not mirrored in public opinion. Only one respondent in 20 worldwide says that they have ""a lot of confidence"" in the IMF. Only in India and the Philippines did more than one person in ten have a lot of confidence in the IMF. Internationally, four times as many respondents do not have much confidence at all in it, and those with little confidence outnumber those with confidence by nearly two to one. 
Nor does the IMF's sister organisation for development, the World Bank, fare any better. Again, four people think not much at all of its efforts for every one who has a lot of confidence in it. In only four countries of the 22 surveyed-India, Indonesia, Italy and the Philippines-do those favourable to the World Bank outnumber those unfavourable. Indeed, those questioned by our pollsters have more confidence in the United States to do something about world economic problems than they do for the work of either of the organisations specifically charged with dealing with such problems. For policymakers in 1999, that could prove powerful food for thought. 
The full poll results can be found on our website at www.economist.com  1999 IF THE most urgent question for Republicans in 1998 was why there was so little outrage about Bill Clinton's morals, the most urgent question for protectionists was why there was so little outrage about the surge in foreign takeovers of American companies. 
In the late 198os, when Japanese companies pocketed such American landmarks as the Rockefeller Centre and Columbia Pictures, the country went into a collective funk. A Newsweek cover declared that Japan was ""buying the soul of America""-and Michael Crichton wrote a best-seller, ""Rising Sun"", that was supposed to expose just how dreadful this prospect could be. In 1998, when foreign companies took over Random House, Chrysler, Bankers Trust and Amoco, there was scarcely a murmur of complaint. 
Why? Quite simply, because Americans are now convinced that theirs is the strongest economy in the world. In the 198os Americans hung their heads as the Japanese seized world-leadership in everything from cars to electronics. In the 199os they stood tall again as American companies dominated all the most exciting new industries, from computers to media to finance, and the American economy enjoyed its longest inflation-free expansion since 1945. 
Moreover, American firms are as likely to be the buyers as the bought. In 1989, American investment abroad was about half as much as foreign direct investment in the United States; in 1997, it was more than 25% bigger. Besides, a growing number of Americans-particularly in Silicon Valley and Hollywoodnow see foreign investors less as barbarians at the gates than as cash-rich country cousins who want nothing more than a chance to invest in American success. 
Still, for all their newfound self-confidence Americans remain surprisingly sceptical about free trade: far more sceptical than crisis-battered South Koreans or risk-averse Germans. Despite the booming economy, Bill Clinton has repeatedly failed to win renewal of his ""fast track"" authority to negotiate trade deals, blocking his desires to extend free trade to the whole of Latin America. 
Most of Mr Clinton's fellow Democrats in Congress don't share his enthusiasm for free trade, advocating all sorts of restrictions to do with labour and the environment; and a noisy group of Republican populists is intent on pushing their party in a more protectionist direction. An unholy alliance of these two factions succeeded in holding up the administration's request for $18 billion for the IMF for months, linking the grant to all sorts of time-wasting issues such as dolphin conservation. 
The fact that the IMF got its money in the end suggests that the initiative still lies with the internationalists. But the fact that, eight years into an economic boom, only 37% of Americans claim to support free trade also suggests that economic liberalism would have a harder time surviving trial by recession there than it has in much of the rest of the world.  1999 IF THE most urgent question for Republicans in 1998 was why there was so little outrage about Bill Clinton's morals, the most urgent question for protectionists was why there was so little outrage about the surge in foreign takeovers of American companies.

Americans are delighted with their own economy. Some 85% of Americans say it is performing well to only 14% who say it is performing poorly. By a majority of more than three to one, Americans say their own standard of living has improved. But they are not so confident about next year. More think that their economy will get worse than think it will get better. This is probably because a plurality of them are pretty pessimistic about the prospects for the world economy. 
By contrast, the Russians beat the Japanese by a short head for the title of the world's most despairing country. Of Russians, 98% think that the country is doing badly, compared with 91% of Japanese. By a four-to-one margin, the Russians expect things to get worse compared with a margin amongst the Japanese of just over three-to-one on the side of pessimism. 
Dissatisfaction with their government's performance is expressed by 87% of Russians; but an eccentric (nay, extraordinary) 9% think that it is doing well. Similarly, 86% of Japanese are dissatisfied with their government's performance, again with a loyalist 9% applauding their rulers' performance. 
Eighteen Russians think their living standard has got worse over the last year for every one who thinks it has improved. Eleven Japanese feel they are worse off for every one who feels better off. But the Japanese are much more pessimistic about the world economy than are the Russians. Barely more Russians expect the world economy to deteriorate than expect it to improve, but 39% of Japanese think it will deteriorate, while only 4% that it will improve. 
In Asia, gloom is not confined to Japan. South Korea is at the bottom of the pessimists' pack with 88% of her people thinking her economy is in poor shape. Indonesia and Thailand are not reckoned by their people to be doing much better, and Hong Kong is not far behind them. But in all four countries most people expect 1999 to be better economically than 1998. Can this be ascribed to an ""Asian value"" of optimism about the future? Well, in Japan the expectation is of a further deterioration. 
In Europe, outside Britain, the mood ahead of the launch of the single currency on January ist is quite buoyant. In France, Germany and Spain, pluralities think their economies are doing well. In Italy, however, slightly more people think it is doing poorly than think it is doing well. People in all four of these European countries think that their countries will do well in 1999 too. 
The United Kingdom is a bit of a European oddity. Britons are quite cheerful about the state of their economy and a higher proportion (58%) is satisfied with the performance of its government than is true in any other country surveyed outside Asia. But when it comes to prospects for next year, Britons are in pessimistic mood. Some 48% of them expect the world economy to deteriorate, with only 14% expecting it to improve. This is the most negative assessment in any country surveyed except Japan. 
While most of the European Union countries have become much keener on free trade and open markets, Britons have become more protectionist. Of those questioned in Britain, 53% now say they favour protection to 37% opposing it. This represents a net increase of IZ percentage points in protectionist sentiment between 1997 and 1998. 
Latin America is particularly gloomy. Amongst Mexicans, 85% think their economy is performing poorly, as do 75% of Brazilians. Only 29% of Latin Americans think their economy will improve next year, while 41% think it will get worse. The rest either don't know, or think it will stay the same. 
Comparing China and India, both think their economies are doing poorly, but the Indians are the more dissatisfied. Both think they will do better next year, with the Chinese much more optimistic Both also think the world economy will recover next year, again with the Chinese rather more optimistic  1999 Financial institutions are rushing to be ready for the euro's launch. The mood is confident, but there is no guarantee that things will follow the script 
THE dress rehearsals are over, the curtain is rising, and the leading players are scurrying to ensure that the performance begins on time-and wins plaudits. At lunchtime on December 31st, European finance ministers announced the rates at which ii national currencies would convert to Europe's single currency, the euro. By the time financial markets reopen on January 4th, banks must be ready to trade in euros. Between those dates lies a ""changeover weekend"", during which bankers, fund managers, securities dealers and regulators will be working around the clock, slurping not champagne but unseasonally sobering coffee. 
This frantic activity follows months of testing and retesting of banks' computer systems and their links to domestic stock exchanges and clearing houses. Some big banks have undergone five separate dry runs, and most claim they are ready. Still, there are plenty of butterflies. ""It's been like a play in which everyone has been rehearsing in separate dressing rooms,"" says Paul Cantwell of Andersen Consulting. ""When they all take the stage together, no one can be sure how the performance will go."" 
Still, there will be no shortage of action. Over the weekend, on top of doing their normal end-of-year accounts, financial firms must also plug the euro conversion rates into all of their software programs, reroute much of their foreign-exchange trading and redenominate bonds, shares, derivatives portfolios and bank accounts previously held in separate euro-zone currencies. Small wonder that, as well as booking up local hotel rooms, Goldman Sachs has taken the precaution of designating special ""rest areas"" for weary staff 
Although Britain is not adopting the euro, the City, as Europe's largest financial centre, has a feverish air of expectation. After three years of military-style planning, some 30,ooo financial folk will work over the new year weekend to guarantee a smooth transition. Fearful for London's financial-centre status, the City of London Corporation, a wealthy local authority run as a benevolent dictatorship, is doing its bit. It is paying to keep open the ""drain"", a short but key commuter line; making all of its 3,500 parking spaces free; and banning noisy construction work over the weekend. 
Regulators too will be missing lots of new year parties. The Bank of England is bringing in 300 staff to oversee internal changes and monitor the banking system. However, in a sign of public-sector austerity, hungry staff will have to pay for their own take-away food outside normal hours (contrast this with one French bank, which for some weeks has had a member of staff testing possible menus for the right balance of nourishment for the overwrought brain). All of Europe's national central banks will be in regular contact with the European Central Bank's changeover committee, which will be on hand to take emergency action. Members of the ECB'S governing council have been asked to stay within reach of a secure telephone. 
Judging by the mood in Frankfurt, they won't be needed. German bankers ooze confidence, scoffing at talk of last-minute panics. Deutsche Borse, which runs the Frankfurt Stock Exchange, has spent six months fine-tuning its trading and settlement systems for the euro, and does not expect its 9o-strong conversion team to be particularly busy at the weekend. So confident is it that it has set up a special web site (www.eurostatus.exchange.de) so the curious can check on its progress hour by hour. 
Not that the Germans are leaving much to chance. At Commerzbank, where 400 employees will be at work or on stand-by, all calls into the bank will be routed directly to mobile telephones, so that everyone can be reached within seconds. Deutsche Bank has conducted 59 separate trial runs, linking its computers with clearing systems around Europe. During the conversion weekend, 2,ooo employees in 40 offices worldwide will be reporting to a ""global control centre"" in Eschborn, just outside Frankfurt. Deutsche claims it will be the only bank able to offer its full range of products in euros from January 4th. 
After a year in which it lost ground in the race to establish itself as a financial centre for Europe, Paris has no intention of missing any tricks over the conversion to the euro. Two years of preparation, and three rehearsals, culminating in a full dry run in November, have left the city's too-odd financial institutions quietly confident that the traditional French mastery of logistics will ensure a smooth meshing of gears over the long weekend. In all, lo,ooo people will play some part in the 9oo steps into which the exercise has been broken down. Banque Nationale de Paris has hung a 4,ooo-piece jigsaw puzzle in its euro control room, to remind the 6o0 people who will be toiling there that every little bit must fit into the bigger picture. 
Technical efficiency is one thing, but no preparations would be complete without making allowance for that other great French tradition-the strike. The French Bankers Association and the unions have duly negotiated special exemptions from the usual limits on working hours and requirements for Sunday rest. 
Attitudes in Italy seem altogether more laid back. Italian banks say they are ready for the euro, but have much smaller changeover teams on hand than their French and German counterparts. And compared with the Germans, the Italians do not seem to mind if everything does not go like clockwork. A senior official from the Bank of Italy, the central bank, says languidly, ""It will not be the end of the world if things go wrong on Monday. Systems will be working fine on Tuesday or Wednesday."" 
For all the confident talk, there are legitimate fears that the conversion process could still be derailed. Never before has so much depended on so many financial institutions doing so many things simultaneously. Michael Foot, the director in charge of euro planning at the Financial Services Authority, Britain's financial regulator, acknowledges three concerns for the weekend: that banks will run out of time; that data will be corrupted; and that some markets will not be able to reopen first thing Monday morning. Moreover, custodians might ""lose"" assets, and thus be unable to release them. 
Beyond the weekend lies much more work, including tests for settlement systems. Mistakes by one bank in paying another-for example by paying into the wrong account-could prevent the payee from settling its own debts, leading to financial gridlock. SHIFT, which runs a network through which many interbank payments are made, has assembled a 150strong team to help banks deal with payments problems. To avoid bottlenecks, it has warned banks against paying in very large batches. ""Like everyone else we are hoping for the best, but planning for the worst,"" says a spokesman. 
For all the gloomy scenarios, no one is much concerned about the big institutions. At least, not directly. All the big banks in Europe are convinced that they have done enough tinkering-or will have done by Monday-to greet the euro with confidence. Merrill Lynch, for example, has set aside around $8om for the total cost of conversion. More worrying are small and middie-sized banks, which are generally much less well prepared, and the knock-on effect their lack of foresight may have on others. As one apparently well-prepared banker from Salomon Smith Barney puts it: ""You can be driving carefully, but if someone comes around the corner and smashes into you, there isn't much you can do.""  1999 HOWEVER much of a challenge the birth of the euro may seem to bankers in Milan, Italy's financial centre, in the Sicilian capital of Palermo it is being seen as a disaster. The Sicilian regional government is gripped by a financial crisis. Its problem is simple: the regional government has run out of cash (it needs 1.7 trillion lire-$i billion-to balance this year's books) and can't persuade anyone to give it more. Franco Piro, Sicily's head of finance, complains that Sicily is owed 3 trillion lire by the central government. ""We are being punished by the criteria of the Maastricht treaty,"" he moans: the central government has been squeezing spending to fit the country's budget deficit into the 3% corset needed to qualify for euro membership. 
The regional government had previously been able to get loans from domestic and foreign banks to plug the hole; but on December 23rd, the 45 banks that it had approached refused to help. Although Mr Piro ascribes bankers' reluctance to the distractions of Christmas and preparations for the euro, there were weightier reasons for it. Some 30% of bank loans in Sicily are non-performing; the regional government itself has run up some 6 trillion lire in unpaid bills. Nasty experiences in Asia and Russia have made banks more wary of such borrowers. 
Above all, Sicily suffers a huge credibility problem, says Pietro Busetta, head of Fon-dazione Curella, a Palermo thinktank. Local politicians have squandered Sicily's annual budget; many have sought office only for personal gain. ""The solution is to pull down the shutters on the regional government, he suggests. Responsibility could be shifted to Sicily's city councils, which in recent years have been strikingly more efficient than the regional tier. 
But this is unlikely to happen soon. In any case, after changes in central and regional governments in November, both the governing coalition and the Sicilian regional government are now of a similar political complexion. Mr Busetta thinks that makes a rescue from Rome more likely. And there's a bonus: having slipped the lira into the euro, the Italian government is now unlikely to give financial rigour a high priority.  1999 HOWEVER much of a challenge the birth of the euro may seem to bankers in Milan, Italy's financial centre, in the Sicilian capital of Palermo it is being seen as a disaster.

China, where few ordinary citizens have a credit card (indeed, where credit-cardstyle revolving consumer lending is illegal), is MasterCard's second-largest market after America. In 1997, the latest year for which figures are available, its turnover in China was an astounding $73 billion. 
How is the circle squared? As in some other countries, MasterCards in China are more debit than credit cards: cardholders must deposit money into their accounts. Purchases are deducted from these funds. MasterCard's success in China is thus more an indictment of the country's dreadful banks than a capitalist celebration of plastic. Almost all transactions are between businesses for big-ticket items such as tractors and trainloads of raw materials. Chinese companies often use credit cards-rather than cheques or wire transfers-to buy goods and services from each other. 
In the mid-198os, when MasterCard entered the market, the clearing system between banks in different cities was (and is) almost non-existent: a cheque could take up to a month to clear, and many sellers would not release goods until it did. The country did not have the nationwide telecommunications networks necessary for an electronic clearing system. Company executives were forced to carry suitcases of cash if they wanted to seal a deal on the spot. MasterCard uses people at the end of a telephone to approve a purchase rather than computerised links, thus making do with what is available. 
But the company's best days in China may be over. In 1999 the government plans a nationwide electronic clearing and settlement system to connect financial institutions. Still, MasterCard may not be too worried. These, after all, are Chinese banks: expect delays.  1999 SHARE prices in much of the world ended 1998 higher than they started it. Oddly, at the same time, the profitability of companies is shrinking, even in the world's leading economies. This begs the question of whether equity prices in rich countries now make any sense at all-but it also gives ominous warning of disappointing economic growth to come in 1999 
Share prices rose, on average, by more than 15% in 1998 in six of the rich world's biggest economies. But in the third quarter, the latest period for which there is data, company profits were 12% lower than a year earlier in those economies (see chart). Much of this is due to the continued sufferings of Japanese firms. But corporate profitability has fallen compared with the previous year in the other big economies as well. 
Continued economic strife in Asia is one cause of slimmer profit margins elsewhere. The devaluation of Asian currencies, and a huge amount of excess productive capacity, have intensified global price competition, especially in homogeneous, tradable goods such as textiles, chemicals and commodities. But in America and Britain, several years of decent economic growth have driven down unemployment to such an extent that labour costs are starting to rise-although the impact of this has been cushioned by higher productivity. 
These factors are unlikely to go away in 1999. And in continental Europe, the launch of the euro may increase price competition by making differences in pricing between countries in the euro-zone more transparent to consumers. 
In the case of corporate profits, the main uncertainty is how fast, if at all, the world's big economies will grow. The frenzied cutting of short-term interest rates by central bankers since the autumn's brief financial-market crisis seems to have averted the worst for now. But yields on corporate bonds, especially American ones, are typically higher now than six months ago, because investors are more worried about the riskiness of these securities. 
Worse, the recent decline in corporate profitability may itself point to slower growth ahead. In the past, changing profitability has been a useful lead indicator of economic trends. One reason is that, when firms earn lower profits, they generally become less optimistic about their future profitability, and vice versa-and so cut (or boost) their investment spending accordingly. Capital spending by companies is an important contributor to economic growth. If there is less of it, growth suffers. In continental Europe, most of the economic growth during the 199os was due to higher spending by companies. 
America's economy is now especially vulnerable to a sharp reduction in investment by firms. Much attention has been lavished on American consumers' alarming recent habit of spending more than they earn. But American companies also have a ""negative savings ratio"", points out David Mackie, an economist at J.P. Morgan, because they have been borrowing so much to invest. British and continental European companies, in contrast, have not paid for capital spending in the 199os by getting deeper into debt. 
Running up debts to finance investment may make sense in conditions of rapid economic growth. But, when growth slows and profitability tumbles, heavy indebtedness will force companies to make ferocious cuts in capital spending. Mr Mackie thinks this could be severe enough to push the American economy into deep recession. A similar thing happened in Japan, that other ""miracle economy"", in the early i99os. Companies had been borrowing and investing as though the economy would grow for ever. Its economy is still paying the price. Japan's problems have mired Asia in recession; if America's economy went down the plughole, the rest of the world would probably follow suit.  1999 Profits of doom

CAR makers have long used sex to peddle their wares. Recently, however, a new twist to this old idea has developed. Or, rather, two twists-the double helix of DNA. For both BMW and Renault have based their latest European marketing campaigns around this icon of modem biology. Their advertising agents, it seems, have decided that genetics is metaphorically, as well as literally, sexy. 
Advertising agents, of course, are paid to be sensitive to subtle shifts in the Zeitgeist, so the two campaigns might be seen as an indication of how the public actually perceives genetics and the related subject of evolutionary theory. Not surprisingly, a few outdated myths are perpetuated. Both advertisements, for instance, play on the popular conception of evolution not just as change, but as progress-something which many biologists would dispute. But the gist of the advertising shows just how much the central concerns of modern biology have indeed entered the popular consciousness. (There is also a surprising popular appetite for mathematics-see box on next page.) 
BMW'S campaign, which launches its new 3-series sports saloon in Britain and Ireland, shows the new creation and four of its earlier incarnations zigzagging around a landscape made up of giant DNA sequences, with a brief explanation that DNA is the molecule responsible for the inheritance of such features as strength, power and intelligence. The Renault offering, which promotes its existing Laguna model, employs evolutionary theory even more explicitly. The company's television commercials intersperse clips of the car with scenes from a lecture by Steve Jones, a professor of genetics at University College London. Besides Dr Jones, who is one of Britain's most media-friendly scientists, the lecture features pictures of fossils of extinct animals called trilobites, and also the cliched ascent of man from ape to human. 
According to Jeremy Hemmings, who heads BMW's campaign at wcRs, a London advertising firm, the advertisement is intended to convey the idea of development allied to heritage. The latest product, in other words, should be viewed as the new and improved scion of a long line of good cars-with the implication that what is true of the car is also true of the driver. 
The advertisement is stark and highly stylised. To the untutored eye, the DNA sequences look like enormous black-runged ladders (they are actually enlargements of the electrophoretic gels used to tease out the individual genetic ""letters"" of which DNA is composed). But the eyes of BMW drivers are not, of course, untutored. The car is a status symbol in a society where success depends on knowledge, and the ad panders to the presumption that its viewers will have the knowledge to understand it. According to Mr Hemmings, they do. It has had one of BMW'S highest awareness ratings-a measure of how well people remember the product, and the message conveyed. 
Renault's message, according to Jonathan Wignall, the head of the Laguna campaign at the company's British subsidiary, is more subtle. It is that evolution works by gradual improvements rather than sudden leaps (in this, Renault is aligning itself with biological orthodoxy). So, although the new car in the advertisement may look like the old one, the external form conceals a number of significant changes to the engine. While these alterations are almost invisible to the average driver, Renault hopes they will improve the car's performance, and ultimately its survival in the marketplace. 
Whether they actually do so will depend, in part, on whether marketeers have read the public mood correctly. For, even if genetics really does offer a useful metaphor for automobiles, employing it in advertising is not without its dangers. 
That is because DNA'S public image is ambiguous. In one context, people may see it as the cornerstone of modern medical progress. In another, it will bring to mind such controversial issues as abortion, genetically modified foodstuffs, and the sinister subject of eugenics. 
In some countries, such as Germany (where the BMW campaign has not run, even though the company is German), people are particularly sensitive to these issues. And when genetics is not merely a metaphor, but the actual product, things can go horribly wrong-as Monsanto, an American biotechnology company, found when it spent L1m ($1.68m) attempting to persuade the British ofthe merits of genetically engineered foodstuffs. The actual effect of the campaign, unluckily for Monsanto, was to alert sceptical consumers to the fact that something they may have thought would be happening in the indeterminate future was about to hit their supermarket shelves. Few liked the idea. 
Car makers are probably standing on safer ground than biotechnology firms. But even they can make mistakes. Though it would not be obvious to the casual observer, some of the DNA which features in BMW'S ads for its nice, new car once belonged to a woolly mammoth-a beast that has been extinct for 10,000 years. Not, presumably, quite the message that the marketing department was trying to convey.  1999 IF AN old rule of thumb from the publishing industry is to believed, every equation included in a book halves the number sold. Yet in recent months several mathematical treatises have become bestsellers. Slim volumes have told the stories of the numbers e, n (which has also had a film named after it) and i (the square root of-1), while other books have explored the nature of infinity, the workings of calculus and, most successfully of all, how Fermat's last theorem was eventually proved after centuries of effort. Given how much schoolchildren hate maths, this is all rather surprising. 
The secret, it turns out, is to stick to the old rule and leave out the dreaded equations-and, indeed, any other scary-looking squiggles likely to remind readers of their school days. Instead, mathematical blockbusters take the form of biographies (often, admittedly, of numbers, not people), histories (of the calendar, for exampie), quests (to prove or disprove things), or coming-of-age tales such as ""Good Will Hunting"", a film in which a young prodigy redeems himself through mathematics. In other words, standard story-telling devices are used to sugar the mathematical pill. 
The resulting books and films are appealing for two reasons, according to Peter Tallack of Weidenfeld & Nicolson, a British publisher. First, they are aspirational: they offer readers the illusion of grappling with mathematical concepts, without having to do the hard work of actually understanding them. A classic example is Simon Singh's book on Fermat's last theorem, which wafts such abstruse ideas as modular forms, elliptic curves, and Galois theory under the reader's nose. 
The second reason is that these mathematical blockbusters provide an attractive and convenient excuse for people who hated maths at school. ""Look,"" they can say, ""I liked this book, so I must simply have had useless teachers."" (Do not ask someone who offers this excuse after reading Dr Singh's book to prove Fermat's last theorem over dinner.) 
Publishers may not understand much maths either, but they know how to add up the profits from a winning formula. More maths books are heading for the printing presses. Three tomes about zero alone are currently in production. Just wait for the numbers from sales of the film rights. 
pattern of the liquid crystals is designed to produce the same effect on the passing light that a real P2000 would have. The two subbeams are then recombined in the normal way and the result shone on to a 2mm-wide square on a piece of photosensitive plastic to create a hogel. 
In practice, three lasers-one for each of the primary colours red, green and blueare shone through the screen simultaneously to produce a full-colour hogel. The process is then repeated for a neighbouring hogel using a neighbouring ray trace. 
Making the master image is a time-consuming process. The ray trace for each hogel must be computed separately; even using the latest Silicon Graphics supercomputers, that takes over a second. The whole image, therefore, requires about 3oo hours to generate. (It contains around three terabytes of data, which is more than a copy of the film ""Titanic"".) Making subsequent copies should, however, be a lot faster. Zebra reckons that, once the number-crunching has been done, it will be possible to turn them out at the rate of 12 an hour. 
The Detroit display is, of course, a publicity stunt. It is unlikely that customers will be content to inspect a mere hologram before they buy. But the Zebra system has several serious purposes. When perfected, it will speed up the design process by giving engineers a real sense of what their brainchildren look like, without the need for the clay models they currently employ. And, when a design is completed, the senior executives who make the decision about whether to put it into production will have a much better idea of what it is that they are approving or rejecting. 
If mass produced, Zebra's system could also add a new dimension to poster advertising-and not just in the car industry. The company is planning to market the invention to a wide range of advertising and entertainment firms. So, although the holodeck of the starship Enterprise may still be some way off, the ads for Star Trek movies may soon have their own dimensions of virtual reality.  1999 JOURNALISTS attending the Detroit Motor Show-the American automobile industry's top annual shindig-are used to seeing concept cars. These are vehicles that incorporate the sort of technological wizardry which manufacturers hope to put into their production models a year or two hence. This year, however, Ford will go one better. The star of its stand is the P2000, a car that is not so much conceptual as non-existent. And yet visitors to the stand will be able to walk around it, look inside and underneath it, and do almost everything to it that motoring journalists normally do except kick its tyres and drive off in it. For the P2000 is a hologram. 
Holography, of course, is nothing new. But the technology that has produced the P2ooo is a significant step forward for several reasons. First, it allows holograms to be big (currently, the largest are about a metre, or three feet, across; the P2000 image is printed on ten 6ocm-square panels, making it three metres by two). Second, it abolishes the weird distortions of parallax which normal holograms suffer when examined from the wrong direction. Third, it produces accurate colours. And fourth, you don't actually have to have a real object to photograph. 
This holographic paragon was invented by Michael Klug and his colleagues at Zebra Imaging, in Austin, Texas, when they were students at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology's Media Laboratory. It works by building on a surprising holographic principle-that each bit of the film carrying a hologram actually contains a whole image. (In other words, if you cut a piece of holographic film in two, and look at one half, you will still see a complete picture, albeit with a more restricted view.) 
Zebra's process makes this explicit. Its holograms are, like a television image, composed of numerous elements (called ""hogels"", in imitation of a television screen's ""pixels""), each of which is a complete hologram in its own right, but is taken from a slightly different angle to its neighbours. 
""Taken"" is, perhaps, not quite the right word. Since the P2000 doesn't exist, there is no object to take even a single image of, let alone the 9oo,ooo images that go to make up the Zebra hologram. This deficiency is made up for by the computers in Ford's design department, on which the P200 has been conceived. These machines are able to ""view"" the new car from any angle they like, under any lighting conditions that are programmed into them, and it is these individual views, known as ray traces, that are used to generate the hogels. 
A hologram of a real object is made by splitting a laser beam in two, reflecting one of the two resulting sub-beams off the object of interest, recombining the sub-beams, and exposing a photographic plate or film to the result. The interference between the subbeam that has been reflected off the object and the unaffected (or ""reference"") sub-beam produces a pattern on the plate which, when developed and illuminated, reveals a three-dimensional picture of the original object. 
In the case of the P2,ooo, the object sub-beam is directed through a liquid-crystal screen rather than on to a real object. The screen is under computer control, and the pattern of the liquid crystals is designed to produce the same effect on the passing light that a real P2000 would have. The two subbeams are then recombined in the normal way and the result shone on to a 2mm-wide square on a piece of photosensitive plastic to create a hogel.

It is 8.3 metres (326 inches) across, and although it sits on a mountain top on the island of Hawaii rather than in Japan itself, it is the pride and joy of Japanese astronomy. It is the heart of the National Astronomical Observatory of Japan's latest toy, the Subaru telescope-a device named after the star cluster known to westerners as the Pleiades. 
National pride was, indeed, an important motive for building the new telescope. That its mirror is 10cm wider than any other telescope's gives Japan's bureaucrats a warm glow that probably makes up for their having to change the law to grant diplomatic privileges to the civil-service astronomers travelling to Hawaii to operate it That it is 6.42 metres wider than the mirror of the country's largest existing instrument-a tiddler located near Okayama, in western Honshugives an even warmer glow to the astronomers themselves. Now they will be able to make some serious observations in the visible and infra-red frequencies, and thus hold up their heads at conferences. 
Such size, however, can bring problems of its own. Big mirrors are expensive, so the modern trend is towards computer-controlled arrays of smaller, cheaper mirrors that can be co-ordinated to mimic the behaviour of a single large one. Big mirrors also tend to sag under their own weight, distorting as they move around to look at different parts of the sky. 
In Subaru's case the sagging is dealt with by making the mirror thin-a mere 20cm from back to front. Though that also makes it more flexible (and makes the ability to grind and polish the glass to create a light-capturing parabolic surface without actually breaking the thing all the more impressive), this flexibility can be exploited to keep the reflective surface in shape. 
That is done by 261 ""actuator"" arms, which push on the mirror from behind to preserve the curvature so precisely that it can distinguish two objects 1/18,000th of a degree apart-the equivalent of being able to spot a tennis ball on the neighbouring island of Maui, 100km away. 
This, combined with a new digital camera developed for it by Mitsubishi Electric, will make it the most powerful groundbased optical telescope around. And when its aluminium coating is replaced with silver in a year or two's time (a huge vacuumchamber housed at the telescope's base will be used to deposit metallic vapour on to the mirror's reflecting surface), it will be able to see into the infra-red with equal clarity, opening up a much neglected area of astronomy. Indeed, at some wavelengths it should out-perform the Hubble space telescope, which does not even have the handicap of looking through the atmosphere. 
But what will it search for? One bothersome thing astronomers have discovered, as they have peered ever deeper into space, has been unexpected regions of sheer emptiness. Like huge bubbles, these so-called ""great voids"", which are hundreds of millions of light-years across, seem to be surrounded by thin films. In this case the films are composed of billions of individual galaxies. The universe, in other words, appears to be made of foam. 
The most likely explanation for this is that gravitational forces from invisible socalled ""dark matter""-perhaps lOO times more abundant than the observable matter in the universe-are tugging that observable matter into odd shapes. By measuring some of these large bubbles, Norio Kaifu, the head of the project in Hawaii, hopes that Subaru will provide astronomers with a clearer idea of what, if it actually exists, the dark matter really is. 
Further out into space, beyond lo billion light-years, Subaru will be able to see the universe in its infancy-not long after the primordial fireball cooled enough to become transparent. While still unable to observe the actual beginning of the universe (signs of which are reckoned to be 15 billion light-years away), the telescope will be able to detect some of the earliest objects to condense from the primordial gas. 
These objects are predicted to be galaxies in their initial star-forming phase, with giant black holes at their centres. Dr Kaifu hopes to find them by using naturally occurring ""gravitational lenses"" to boost Subaru's magnification still further. 
A gravitational lens is a galaxy that lies exactly between a more distant object and the earth. Its gravitational field thus bends and focuses the light from the distant object, making it appear closer than it really is. Such lenses have already been used successfully by the Hubble telescope but, with its longer reach, Subaru ought to be able to employ them to look still further afield. Size, it appears, does matter after all.  1999 The war against drugs is either not working or succeeding at too high a cost, several recent books agree. What should replace it is harder to be certain of

THE Fix By Michael Massing. Simon and Schuster; 335 pages; $25 
WAR is a dirty business, and the war Won drugs involves plenty of filth: deceit, corruption and damage to civil liberties, not to mention outright violence-and that's just from the good guys. Every struggle has to have heroes, and America's antidrugs campaign makes its casting billboard-clear. The white hats are enforcement agents stamping out narcotics at home and abroad, police sweeping dealers and users off the streets,judges jailing drug offenders, not to mention plucky little civilians who ""just say no"". The black hats are shadowy figures: greedy drug barons, mostly foreign, who exploit their own countrymen and corrupt America's children. Congress and Hollywood, spurred on by alarmed parents, have created such a drugs mythology that the good and evil of narcotics is now as distinct, to many, as Mother Teresa and Saddam Hussein. 
Yet today's highly militarised drugs campaign originated in more than medicine and morality. From the start the war has involved political interest and financial gain, as well as frequent misunderstanding-not to mention downright misrepresentation-of the best evidence about drugs' medical and social effects. 
If these were novel or incidental mistakes, the war might be more understandable. But, along with social concern and good sense, modern drug policy has from the start involved fear and unreason, often directed against foreigners or outsiders. It is almost 125 years since authorities in San Francisco launched an early salvo in the western war on drugs by clamping down on opium use among the growing population of Chinese labourers. In the years leading up to the Harrison Act of 1914, which amounted to the first federal ban on nonmedical narcotics, its drafters played on fears of drug-crazed, sex-mad negroes to win support in the South. 
Then 20 years later, the spectre of the sky-high, violent Mexican immigrant was played up to sell the public on the criminalising of marijuana. At several times since the 1930s, governments have used the drug card, whether to lean on dispensible foreign dictators or to brush back homegrown countercultures. 
One thing that has changed, though, are the high stakes that America is willing to play. In 198o, the federal government spent around $1 billion on drug control; federal, state and local spending last year exceeded $30 billion, which includes much expanded programmes of crop eradication, border patrolling and sting operations. Only a third of the federal government's drug-control spending goes on drugs education or drugs treatment. 
How much success this money buys depends on your definition. According to United Nations estimates, Americans are spending almost $60 billion on illegal drugs a year, mainly on the ""soft"" drug, marijuana, and its ""hard"" counterparts, cocaine and heroin. These are, unavoidably, guesstimates. But nobody seriously contests that drugs continue to pour into America and that prices have fallen. Cocaine costs half or less what it did in the early 198os and heroin sells for just under $1,ooo a gram, three-fifths of its price a decade ago. Purity has also increased. In the 198os, street heroin was so adulterated that injecting straight into the blood was the surest way to achieve a high. Now fixes are commonly more than 5o% pure, which means that users who might be deterred by needles can smoke or snort the drug instead. 
A third of all Americans admit to having tried drugs and at least 13m are occasional users. Drug arrests were i.im in 1995, double the 198o figure. There are 400,ooo Americans behind bars for drug offences, eight times the number 19 years ago. 
Those who fight the war on drugs, with its strict penalties at home and sharp punishment abroad, point to seizures of both drugs and their users as victories. In their terms, they are. And if slowing the spread of hard drugs is a sensible goal, which it seems to be, there is indeed good news. Nationwide studies of drug use, such as the University of Michigan survey of high-school students, suggest that although teenage marijuana use has risen in recent years, experimentation with cocaine or heroin among young, first-time users has stayed fairly steady. Those who question or oppose the drugs war, however, reckon that this is the wrong body count. Although casual hard-drug consumption may be dropping, the number of hard-core hard drug users-those most directly associated with the private and collective misery of drugshas scarcely budged since the war began. 
Instead the war's critics propose an entirely new approach that drops or downplays military means and abandons unconditional surrender as the goal. The antiwar doves, as will be seen, form a growing and disputatious camp. Yet whether they favour disapproval or toleration, continued prohibition or legalisation, most doves accept that core drug abuse is not going to be eradicated at an acceptable price, that crusading moralism is counterproductive and that drugs policy should be refocused on education for the young and ""harm reduction"" for habitual users-for example, methadone programmes, needle-exchange centres or prescription heroin. 
It sounds like common sense. But good sense alone will not end the war on drugs. Both the law makers and law breakers have too much invested in the conflict for either to lay down arms easily. Even amid falling prices, drug producers continue to profit from the risk premium that prohibition puts on their multi-billion dollar industry. The anti-drug warriors' jobs and budgets depend on expensive enforcement and lucrative asset seizures. Having demonised their foes, they can only with great difficulty now make peace with the devil. 
Back to the future 
Neither side is above massaging the drugs statistics. But anyone who suspects that the critics of the drugs war are toying with the facts should read ""Drug Crazy"". This book describes the origins and consequences of America's present narcotics policy. It moves from gangland drug busts to Colombian coca plantations to Mexican border patrols. This is reportage from the front line, told with all the verve of an action film, a style which no doubt owes much to the fact that its author, Mike Gray, is a Hollywood screenwriter and producer. 
Mr Gray does not shrink from describing the violence of the drugs war, from shoot-outs in the ghettoes of Chicago to explosions on the streets of Bogota. But the legal burden of America's current drug policy comes through most clearly in his description of how drug dealers are brought to justice. Chicago's county court, which has seen its caseload quadruple in the last 20 years largely because of continued tightening of policy on drugs, now runs round the clock. 
Although most people who take crack cocaine are white, 96% of the crack defendants in federal courts are black or Hispanic. This is largely because white people, being richer, do their deals behind closed doors, while blacks and Hispanics tend to trade on the streets, where they are more easily watched and arrested. 
The night shift at Cook County court catches only the foot soldiers of such drug armies as Chicago's Gangster Disciples. The officers stay out of sight and, generally, out of jail. Justice is summary, and baffling: ten-minute trials lead to five-year sentences for possession of a fifth of an ounce of crack, while the same amount of powdered cocaine lands its owner a few weeks in prison. Crack is cocaine mixed with baking soda to make it smokable and stronger. But concentrating the drug also concentrates the penalty, introduced during the crack scare of the 198os. As blacks use more crack than powdered cocaine, the punishment falls disproportionately on them. Arrest and imprisonment are scarcely deterrents. A young lawyer at the county court is quoted as saying, ""We're not producing justice here. We're manufacturing revolutionaries."" 
On a continent once famous for revolutionaries-Latin America-the tough position of the United States has had mixed effects. The Bush administration spent $2 billion on crop eradication and substitution, spraying the jungle and bribing peasants to plant passion fruit rather than coca plants-with little success. By 1992, cocaine production had grown by 15% and the business had spread across an area the size of the continental United States. It had also become frighteningly efficient, first dominated by Pablo Escobar (a ""ruthless killer"", as Mr Gray describes him, with ""a pleasant side"") in Medellin and then the Rodriguez Orejuela brothers in Cali. The high-tech barriers America erected along its borders have succeeded in diverting entry of South American cocaine from Florida to California and Texas via Mexico, thereby drawing another country into the violence and corruption which has plagued Colombia. And the high premium that the criminalisation of drugs places on them means that South America has turned its eye to heroin, a far more profitable drug than cocaine. 
None of this, as Mr Gray stresses, should come as a surprise. America's last concerted effort at substance control, prohibition of alcohol in the 192os, had similar effects. It inflated prices, drove bootleg suppliers to organise, encouraged the spread of guns and crime, corrupted a quarter of the federal enforcement agents-and doubled the consumption of hard liquor, all within a decade. Nor does ""Drug Crazy"" neglect the influence of stubborn or strong-minded individuals. It is full of outsize characters from the past: Hamilton Wright, for example, an American doctor turned diplomat, who tried to bully the world into drug prohibition, crafted the Harrison Narcotics Act and was later sacked for drinking on the job. Or Harry Anslinger, head of drug enforcement from 1930 to to i962, who perfected the sledge hammer school of narcotics control and invoked every menace from axemen to communism. 
Drugs in history 
Because the drugs war is so noisy and so visible, it is often easy to forget that drugs are not just an American issue. Martin Booth's ""Opium: A History"" charts the rise of heroin from its ancient origins in the poppies of Eastern Europe to modern-day trade on the streets of America. The book's wealth of detail is remarkable: all aspects botanical, political, economic, cultural and pharmacological are discussed (including the unexpected etymology of such slang as ""hip"", ""hype"" and ""junkie""). Unlike ""Drug Crazy"" which is mainly focused on the Americas, much of ""Opium"" is set in Europe and Asia, giving the book a more international perspective and more comprehensive feel. 
Although Mr Booth's accounts of famous addicts, from Clive of India to John Pemberton, the inventor of Coca-Cola, make for interesting reading, the real fascination of ""Opium"" is in its account of the common man's habit through history. Until the Harrison Act, morphine and opium-mainly in the tincture laudanum or as patent medicine-were freely available in America, as they were in Europe. Opium was a sovereign cure in Victorian England for afflictions ranging from diarrhoea to depression. Babies were fed the drug in soothing syrups such as Godfrey's Cordial, leading to claims of physical and mental retardation, exactly the same concerns voiced about today's ""crack babies"". 
In 1868, British public health authorities took most opiates out of the hands of grocers and put them into those of dispensing doctors and pharmacists (as, in America, did the Harrison Act). Starting with the International Opium Commission of 1909, American efforts to curtail world manufacture, sale and distribution of opium and its derivatives met with lively resistance from Europe, India and other countries with a stake in the international trade. Yet from the 1920s to the 198os, a series of international treaties forced countries to clamp down on the production, trade and consumption of opiates, whether for ritual, for fun or as self-administered medicine. In that time, the penalties for peddling and possession tended to climb, especially in America. 
One clear historical lesson that emerges from ""Opium"" is that people will take drugs whether or not they are proscribed, and they will do so for all sorts of reasonsto escape life's burdens, for adventure, for straightforward fun. In 19th-century Britain, Mr Booth tells us, the Fens of East Anglia were awash in opium. Agricultural labourers took their pennyworth of ""elevation"" along with a nightly beer as a lift out of working drudgery. This is not so far from the plight of crack addicts in America's inner cities, boxed in by poverty, deadend jobs and broken families. 
What does vary widely with history, however, are official attitudes towards the drug trade. As Britain followed America's line in the 198os and got ""tough on drugs"", complaints were regularly fired against heroin-producing nations, such as Pakistan. Supply-side control was seen as the solution to the drug problem; if only these people would pull up their poppies, then Western drug use would plummet. Ironically, exactly the same argument was used against the British in the early 19th century, when they foisted opium from India on the Chinese in exchange for tea. When China's then drug czar, Lin Ts-hsu, complained to the British that they were breaking imperial edicts banning opium import and possession, the prime minister, Lord Palmerston, replied that the opium trade was a Chinese problem and that it should be dealt with by controlling consumption. His logic sounds familiar today. 
Such shifts are common in drug debates, according to Richard Rudgley, a University of Oxford anthropologist. Which intoxicants are forbidden and which tolerated has never added up to a very coherent story. How many exasperated parents have lectured teenagers about drugs while pouring themselves a third drink or lighting another fag? Some of the most debilitating and addictive compounds, such as alcohol and tobacco, are permitted while less obviously damaging drugs such as marijuana are widely proscribed. 
In ""The Encyclopedia of Psychoactive Substances"", Mr Rudgley offers a quick history of almost lOO drugs, sacred and profane, from the hallucinogenic mushroom amanita to the zombie mixtures of Haitian folklore. Though dutiful on ordinary drugs, he is gripped when it comes to the exotic or obscure. There are intriguing entries on socalled psychoactive animals. Apparently members of the Humr tribe in south-west Sudan dream vividly of giraffes after taking giraffe liver extract or bone marrow. What heroin taker would swap its orgasmic rush for a giraffe dream? As Mr Rudgley sweeps from soma of the ancient Indo-Iranians to Ecstasy in the British rave scene, he is careful always to put his psychoactive substances into a wider cultural or even ritual context, an aspect that has been largely lost in Western drug use. 
A quick fix 
Common to many of these books is the charge that American administrations have tended to neglect solid evidence which might ease their drug bind. This is most obvious with marijuana, which 7om Americans over the age of 12 have tried, some for medical reasons, but most for fun. Since the 193os, blue-ribbon panels of scientists and doctors have urged its decriminalisation, only to meet rebuttal from influential voices, like Anslinger, that marijuana was a ""gateway"" substance leading users to more damaging drugs such as heroin. Yet the evidence to support marijuana's ""gateway"" status is remarkably thin. Marijuana is not benign. There are legitimate concerns about its effect on memory and on the lungs, among other organs. But by most clinical (and personal) accounts, the drug is no more dangerous than alcohol, a freely-flowing intoxicant. 
Yet marijuana policy in America does appear to be softening. Half a dozen states have voted to legalise the drug for medical purposes. By contrast, the tough official policy on hard drugs shows little sign of change. Nor do the anti-drug-war doves air pear to be making much headway in winning converts where it counts-among elected politicians and in the criminal-justice system. Part of the trouble is that the anti-war camp is divided, not least on something seemingly as basic as the medical effects of hard drugs. This is not their fault: the issues are complex and the evidence is often disputable. Yet given the sheer weight of belief that hard drugs are very dangerous indeed, the burden of disproof rests, politically, on the doves. 
To take a glaring example of where wellinformed, fair-minded people can differ on what you might expect was observable fact: Mr Rudgley describes the bleak prospects of America's 375,ooo crack babies, born to addicted mothers, who face a life of mental and physical retardation. But Mr Gray claims that this figure is grossly exaggerated and that most crack babies grow up to be quite normal and not ""brain-damaged, unteachable monsters"". 
Any sensible approach to hard drugs ought to start with an understanding of addiction. But addiction, too, appears to be a bendable notion. Do drugs give addicts a habit or do addicts make a habit of drugs? Not everyone who takes a hard drug spirals into dependence. How destructive it is to be hooked depends a lot on your circumstances. Cocaine is most certainly addictive for some, but many users manage to limit their intake to the occasional snort. Heroin is much harder to take or leave. But addicts can regularise consumption and do jobs, as heroin-prescription programmes in Switzerland and Britain have shown. 
The best research seems to confirm most people's intuition that addiction depends on a damaging mix of biochemistry and bad social conditions. Much of this research is discussed in ""Buzzed"", a guide to the effects of legal and illicit drugs from coffee to cocaine. The authors wrote it out of concern for what they take to be a growing ""disconnect"" between advances in understanding of the physiology of addiction and public perceptions of drug abuse. ""Buzzed"" describes complex neurochemistry with admirable clarity and its glossary of drug terms will raise smiles. Roche may be a respectable Swiss pharmaceutical company. But ""Roche"" in street slang is Rohypnol, the notorious date-rape drug. ""Prudential"" has nothing to do with insurance but means a crack-user. ""Buzzed"" is less clear about how much cocaine or heroin you can take without risking addiction. This is not its fault. Even the best evidence on this has an elusive, it-depends quality: instant, one-off addiction is rare even with heroin, it seems, but repeated use over a few weeks or less can create dependence. Yes, but what is the connection between that first use and those few repeats? 
Denouncing the war on drugs is the easy part. Finding a different approach is trickier. The more radical anti-war doves believe in sweeping legalisation. Dirk Chase Eldredge is one such and he makes a fact-packed case in ""Ending the War on Drugs"". Unlike ""Drug Crazy"", which views the war from the trenches, this book reads more like a conference report from a chateau general. 
Yet the author is not what you might expect. Mr Eldredge is a life-long Republican and former campaign manager for President Reagan, whose wife, Nancy, sponsored ""Just Say No"". Within the party his is very much a minority view: most Republicans in Congress who speak out on the issue are unblinkingly pro-war and would like to see users and pushers off the streets for good. 
Undaunted, Mr Eldredge spells out how legalisation could be accomplished. His preferred system would include staterun sales, quality-and-price control and a ban on advertising. Revenue from drug sales and a ""peace dividend"" (fewer prisoners and crop eradications to pay for)would, he believes, provide money for anti-drug education, drug treatment and research. 
As a virgin-lands policy, this has strong appeal. Unfortunately, America is not virgin soil and Mr Eldredge's proposal is beset by several layers of difficulty. He himselfacknowledges the problem faced by the constitutional primacyof the states in criminal matters: repealing federal drug laws would do little good if states did not follow in concert. He imagines the black market that would persist if for example one state legalised while its neighbour continued to proscribe. 
A similar difficulty exists at the international level. America has signed several drug treaties that prohibit trade in narcotics and oblige countries to police its use. Either America must persuade much of the world to decriminalise, having spent decades cajoling or coercing other nations into adopting an opposite line. Or America must abrogate treaties and legalise unilaterally, a step which could turn it into a black-market drugs exporter. Politically, neither course looks appetising. 
A third problem is uncertainty about the use- and addiction-effects if cocaine and heroin were decriminalised. It may well be that some people will take drugs whatever the law says. Just as Mr Booth cites history, Mr Eldredge cites recent opinion polls in support of the view that drug laws have little visible effect on drug conduct. There are strict drug laws and most people do not take drugs. But to treat the second as a consequence of the first, he believes, is a mistake. The reasons people give for why they do not take drugs include all sorts of things-health effects, moral scruples, personal dislikes-but the law seldom figures highly among them. 
This is persuasive as far as it goes. But it skirts the main issue: how many people would try hard drugs if they were legally available, and how many new addicts would there be? Prohibitionists point to the Dutch experience. The partial decriminalisation of cannabis there was followed, they point out, by a sharp rise in use by teenagers. Increased availability, in other words, inevitably means some increased consumption. But the marijuana parallel is not relevant, many doves insist, since soft and hard drugs are so different. Cocaine and heroin, they seem to be saying, are their own best deterrent. 
The truth is nobody can say with any confidence what would happen if hard drugs were legalised. No country has yet dared to try and addiction research has not yet given firm enough answers. 
A middle way 
Not surprisingly, many people are looking for a middle way between the diehard warriors and the out-and-out legalisers. Last year, Foreign Affairs published an instructive exchange between Ethan Nadelmann, who favours harm-reduction for illegal hard drugs in a context of marijuana decriminalisation (""Commonsense Drug Policy"";January-February 1998 issue) and Herbert Kleber and Mitchell Rosenthal, who favour continued proscription but think money should also be invested in education, treatment and research on the home front (""Drug Myths from Abroad""; September-October 1998). 
In ""The Fix"", Michael Massing describes in detail one of America's few sustained attempts to relieve or cure addicts rather than punish them. Early in the 197os an estimated 600,ooo Americans regularly used heroin, a number swollen by addicted soldiers returning from Vietnam. President Nixon asked Jerome Jaffe, a psychiatrist from Chicago, to set up methadone centres and abstinence programmes across the country. At their height, such ""demandside"" initiatives received two-thirds of the federal drug budget, and made considerable gains: crime rates fell and fewer addicts died of overdoses. 
But as the heroin crisis abated, so did government interest in the Jaffe programmes. Subsequent administrations, Republican and Democratic, turned to ""sup ply-side"" controls abroad and to locking up users and pushers in America. Mr Massing is particularly critical of a shift in resources under Presidents Reagan and Bush from the dark heart of drug use-hard-core cocaine and heroin addiction-to teenage marijuana use. 
A few methadone treatment centres carry on Dr Jaffe's tradition, but they have room for only 15% of America's 800,ooo heroin addicts. ""The Fix"" takes to the street with one service, New York's Hot Line Cares, as it lives hand-to-mouth trying to get the city's crack addicts into precious treatment slots. The reward is found, not only in Mr Massing's accounts of wasted lives rescued through treatment, but also in hard economics. According to a 1992 study conducted by California's Rand Corporation, treatment is seven times better at reducing cocaine consumption in America than domestic law enforcement and an astonishing 23 times more effective than blasting foreign drug sources. Mr Massing advocates a rebalancing of the nation's drug budget, with half of its resources allocated to treatment and education, out of the pocket of supply-side control. Drug warriors certainly challenge this balance of power. An increased investment in treatment or harm reduction will not singlehandedly solve the drug problem. But at least they will not make matters worse, which the war on drugs very arguably has.  1999 FOR more than five years William Gaddis worked on his first novel, ""The Recognitions"", hoping for, and half expecting, instant success. He would not, he said later, have been ""terribly surprised"" to get the Nobel. Quick fame came to Scott Fitzgerald and Ernest Hemingway. Why not to him? Young writers know the feeling. But ""The Recognitions"" did not even receive the kindness usually accorded to first novels. Those critics that cared to review the book said it was a dud. ""Sprawling, squalling, overwritten,"" wrote one sadist. 
Twenty years later, in 1975, Mr Gaddis ventured to publish a second novel, ""J.R"". It received ecstatic reviews. It was ""inventive and subtle"", ""wildly satiric"", ""dazzling"". Swift himself would have been happy with it. Mr Gaddis became the recipient of numerous literary prizes. ""The Recognitions"" was judged, on rereading, to be one of the most important American novels of the past 50 years. 
How can critics make such a misjudgment? Quite easily, especially if, as in the case of Mr Gaddis's writing, there are a few problems. For one thing, his books are very long. ""The Recognitions"" runs to nearly 1,000 pages, a time-consuming read for a critic whose review has to be in by tomorrow. Then, much of the narrative is in the form of conversation, but without much punctuation to help it along. It is nearer in style to James Joyce than to Jackie Collins. But with a little effort you get used to it. Mr Gaddis was a gentle innovator and against what he called the ""originality of incompetent idiots"" who ""could not do a thing the right way"". He strove to get the right words in every sentence of his mammoth novels. ""There is an obligation not to bore or to be bored yourself,"" he said. 
In the years after Mr Gaddis's appalling start, those who take an interest in new writing had time to read his work and become ""dazzled"". By the time his second book came along, he had acquired, by word of mouth in America and Europe, a reputation as a writer worth watching. The critics, suitably forewarned, read ""J.R"" more carefully. 
The wizard of Wall Street 
""JR"" is about an ii-year-old boy who goes on a school trip to Wall Street and is given a single share in order to experience the charm of ""investing in America"". He invests so astutely that he takes control of a company and makes a fortune. ""The Recognitions"" is about a clergyman's son who becomes a painter. ""Carpenter's Gothic"" is about an evangelical clergyman with an interest in helping exploited people. ""A Frolic of His Own"", is about a motorist who figures out whom to sue after arranging his own car accident. They sound the sort of tales that might be turned into films about American life. But that depends on how you see America. The Disney-sounding financial prodigy is deemed, at ii, to have the mental age of the average American adult. He is without scruples and is motivated solely by greed. The painter becomes a forger and takes the view that everything in life is a fraud. The concerned clergyman epitomises human stupidity. The motorist finds himself caught in the absurdities of American law. 
Mr Gaddis gained a view of the practical world during the years when he was unable to make a living from literature. After leaving Harvard, where he edited the Harvard Lampoon, he had a number of casual jobs, among them checking facts for the New Yorker magazine and working on a lock in the Panama canal; later, more permanently, he was doing publicity for a pharmaceutical company, working on training films for the army and writing speeches for company executives. His speeches were admired for their wit and their elegant exposition of the aims of capitalism, a feature notably absent from ""J.R"", although Mr Gaddis once said that free enterprise, for all its doubtful morality, was the least-dangerous economic system yet devised. 
William Gaddis avoided personal publicity. He gave interviews only to literary magazines that few people read. The experiences of his varied life went into his books, not on to television. An acquaintance recalled seeing him at a writers' conference which was attended by Allen Ginsberg, a selfpublicising poet who declaimed his verse accompanied by an accordion he usually carried. Mr Gaddis, by contrast, ""spoke in measured tones of the small sales that the serious novelist might expect."" It was an austere view, a rejection of the general philosophy of the book trade, which is unconcerned about whether books are read as long as they are bought. 
Even after his critical acclaim, his sales remained modest. He could never be a Hemingway, who happily advertised his colourful life. He never wrote sentimentally about being an American in Paris. He had lived there for a time and dismissed it: ""Age cannot wither, nor custom stale, her infinite vulgarity."" William Gaddis published only four books. He left a fifth, called ""Agape Agape"". Its publication date has yet to be set. There is no hurry. His admirers are a patient lot.  1999 PRICES AND WAGES In November, 12-month consumer-price inflation in the euro-il countries fell slightly, to 0.9%. Danish inflation stayed at 1.7%. Canada's inflation rate edged up to 1.2%, and Japan's to 0.8%. Denmark's producer prices fell by 2.2% in the year to November. Italian workers received a 2.3% pay rise in the year to November, a real rise of 0.8%.  1999 COMMODITY PRICE INDEX 
Our all-items dollar index slumped by 16.5% in 1998 and is now at its lowest level for five years. Both industrial and food prices have been hit by falling demand in the wake of the Asian and Russian financial crises. The metals index has fallen by 45% from its peak in January 1995. A sustained recovery in metal prices is unlikely without cuts in output. Copper is at a lZ-year low, and nickel at an ii-year low.

BEFORE leaving on January 6th to meet European leaders, Keizo Obuchi, Japan's stolid prime minister, once again managed to confound his critics with a surprising display of political tight-rope walking. Not only has he quelled dissenters within the ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP), but he has assembled a bundle of measures to beat the economy back into motion, nationalised two of the country's sickest banks, provided relief loans to cash-starved employers, refused to be bullied by a hectoring China, and helped to bring Ichiro Ozawa's renegade Liberal Party back within the fold. The coalition government that is now being patched together with the Liberals will make the LDP stronger than it has been at any time since it fell from power when Mr Ozawa and his followers stormed off in a huff to form their own party in 1993. 
Most surprising of all is the way the mild-mannered prime minister has dealt with the blustering Mr Ozawa. The price the leader of the Liberal Party had expected to extract for throwing his weight in with the LDP was presumptuous for a party facing annihilation at the next election. In return for his co-operation, Mr Ozawa wanted the LDP to accept a reduction in the size of both houses of the Diet (parliament), a more streamlined cabinet, an end to the practice of letting bureaucrats answer parliamentary questions for ministers and, above all, a reinterpretation of Japan's pacifist constitution so the country's soldiers could take part more actively in UN peacekeeping operations abroad. To top it all, Mr Ozawa also wanted to be made deputy prime minister. 
Mr Ozawa's views may be a blast of fresh air along the fusty corridors of the LDP's headquarters, but he should have known his former party better. His proposals have been gradually watered down by a series of study groups, one of which, for instance, wants to restrict Japan's armed forces to UN missions that do not involve force. And, as a calculated insult, Mr Ozawa has now been offered no more than the junior post of home-affairs minister. Uncharitable folk suggest that the LDP is out to gobble up the Liberal Party whole while spitting out its leader. 
Mr Obuchi will shuffle his cabinet on January 14th as a precursor to forming the coalition with Mr Ozawa's party. Then, on January 19th, a new 15o-day Diet session will open. One of Mr Ozawa's most trusted lieutenants, Takeshi Noda, is widely tipped for the trade and industry post. And to stifle dissent among the LDP faithful, who blame Mr Ozawa for nearly all their woes, the prime minister is expected to hand a plum portfolio to Koichi Kato, the party secretarygeneral during the previous administration and doyen of the LDP's moderates. Mr Kato, who could well become the next prime minister, abhors Mr Ozawa. 
Despite the possibility of a high post being offered to Mr Kato, the coalition cabinet is almost certain to reflect a shift in power from the moderates to the conservatives. The prospect of having Mr Ozawa and his hard-right conservatives on board-ostensibly to help get two bills through the Diet to allow Japan to play a larger role within its defence agreement with America-has given a new lease of life to the party's neanderthals. 
This week there were rantings against America by Shozaburo Nakamura, the justice minister. Known for his loose grip on reality and looser control still over his tongue, Mr Nakamura told his staff that ""the Japanese are writhing because they cannot revise the constitution, which was made by the allied forces to prevent Japan from waging war."" The chief cabinet secretary, Hiromu Nonaka, quickly jerked Mr Nakamura back into line. 
Indeed, amending the 52year-old constitution is fast becoming more than a vague dream for many of Japan's conservative politicians. Chief among those seeking to rewrite the war-renouncing Article 9 is an inter-party group headed by Taro Nakayama, a veteran LDP politician and former foreign minister. Mr Nakayama aims to establish a standing Diet committee that would stage-manage a review of the constitution. Once it had concluded that a revision was necessary, the group would press for the amendment procedure to get under way at once. To do so would require a two-thirds majority in both chambers of the Diet and approval in a public referendum. It is, though, doubtful whether the right-wingers could muster that kind of support for even a minor constitutional change. 
The review of Japan's constitutional right to collective self-defence, on top of the debate to enlarge the security alliance with the United States and Mr Ozawa's insistence on reinterpreting the rules for sending Japanese troops abroad, is guaranteed to incense the opposition. Both the socialists and the Communists are set against any form of constitutional tinkering. Moreover, Naoto Kan, the leader of the Democratic Party, is expected to use the uproar to mount a personal comeback-having seen his popularity wane after an extramarital affair and the Liberal Party's sudden defection to the government benches. 
As the leader of the largest opposition party, Mr Kan knows that, with the country mired in its worst recession since the second world war and with unemployment at a record high, there is no point in attacking the government's (yen)82 trillion ($730 billion) budget, which has to be approved before the new financial year starts in April. The prime minister has vowed to get the economy, which is officially expected to shrink by 2.2% during this financial year, growing again during the year ahead. Though independent economists expect GDP to shrink yet again, Mr Obuchi has staked his reputation on achieving growth of at least o.5%. 
With the economy off-limits politically, that leaves only the defence and constitutional reforms for Mr Kan's camp to try to use to topple the government. The trouble for the ruling LDP is that, though it has a majority in the lower house without the Liberal Party's help, it is ii seats short of a majority in the upper chamber, even with its coalition partner's support. 
All of which sets the stage for a long battle over defence and constitutional issues. And this will happen just as politicians gear up for a huge number of local elections in April. There will be polls to pick governors in 12 prefectures as well as members for 44 (out of 47) prefectural governments, along with mayoral and local-assembly elections in over 2,000 towns and cities. Among these will be the assembly election for Tokyo, the traditional dress-rehearsal for a general election. Since the miserable state of the economy will give him no help, Mr Obuchi will have to hope that he will get a lift from a successful showing by the LDP in the local elections-and from his continuing death-defying balancing act.

""NERVES"", announces the sign outside Takashi Sumioka's psychiatric clinic. Visiting a shrink is something few Japanese would admit to, but Mr Sumioka's practice has become especially busy. He specialises in treating what he calls ""restructuring syndrome"". The sufferers are mostly men and mostly middle-aged. Some have been sacked, others say they are under pressure to resign. They complain of tiredness, insomnia and depression. Japan's nerves, it seems, are shot to pieces. 
Whereas most countries would welcome an unemployment rate as low as 4.4%, Japan is finding the experience profoundly shocking. The Japanese have long been used to nearly full employment (see chart). Now more and more people are out of work-even more, probably, than the official figures suggest. Just as unsettling are changes in the way the Japanese work. In most big companies, employees thought they had jobs for life, and expected to be kept on till retirement even if they had nothing useful to do. Estimates of these surplus workers-the ""in-house unemployed""-range up to 4.5m. Even where real jobs can be found, they are being filled by temporary and part-time staff 
Japan's big exporters, the kaisha, among them Sony, Toyota and Mitsubishi, have long been reluctant to let workers go. During Japan's explosive growth, big companies did everything they could to hamper job-hopping. They paid staff strictly according to their length of service. Those who stayed until retirement got a fat cheque as a bonus, typically worth more than two years' wages. 
The government did its bit, too. Until recently, it banned temporary workers from most industries and tightly regulated any agency providing temporary staff Except for management positions, full-time jobs can only be filled through the government's own service, cheerily called Hard Waku (Hallo Work). As pensions are not portable, older workers can expect to lose up to half their benefits if they move to another company. The Japanese employers' federation reckons that, because they create such an inflexible labour market, such barriers to changing jobs account for almost three-quarters of Japan's unemployment. 
On top of that, companies could apply for ""employment-adjustment"" subsidies to avoid shedding labour. In the 198os, steel makers used these to diversify into unrelated industries, including mushroom farming and travel agencies. These subsidies are still available. In the four years to the end of 1997, they were doled out to the tune of Y176 billion ($1.6 billion). 
They have acted only to slow change. In past recessions, companies started by cutting back graduate recruitment and laying off part-time workers. As the current downturn has bitten deeper into profits, the pattern has been reversed. Cheaper part-time workers are replacing full-time sararimen (see box on next page). Once the laid-off workers could expect to land a job at small companies, which hired people during slowdowns because the labour market was otherwise too tight. Now, small companies are desperately shedding labour themselves, as record numbers of them go bust. 
None of this is doing much good to Japan's sick economy. The government expects it to shrink by z.z% this year, but even that looks too rosy. While workers fret about the future, spending in the shops continues to disappoint. The car and housing markets have collapsed. As the Diet, Japan's parliament, met this week, the prime minister, Keizo Obuchi, promised to get the economy moving again. His government has pledged to create im new jobs by March 2000. But the task is bewildering, involving deregulation, a revamp of the tax and pensions systems and strengthening the social safety net. In all, it amounts to a complete overhaul of the Japanese labour market. 
A job to deregulate 
This leaves Mr Obuchi with much to do. After a long struggle, the labour ministry has at last caved in to demands to deregulate the temporary-employment agencies. The government is also thinking of extending unemployment insurance. At present, payments stop after 90-300days, depending on age and length of employment. Because of this, less than half the unemployed get any help. Proposals for a system of portable pensions are due by June. The more nebulous prospect of tax reform may slide off the government's agenda entirely. 
Then there is Mr Obuchi's plan to create im jobs, for which he is setting aside Yi trillion. So far, the government has given no details. Its record suggests it will once again pour money into the building industry through a lavish public-works programme. But jobs created this way vanish as quickly as they appear. Of the1m jobs created in the building industry between 199o and 1997, nearly half were lost when the government later cut public spending. 
Together with Rengo, a big tradesunion association, Nikkeiren has proposed some alternative ways to create jobs. These include getting the unemployed to tidy up Japan's cities and putting sacked staff into schools to teach about the world outside the classroom. More interestingly, Nikkeiren is calling for more money to be spent on Japan's housing stock; subsidies to refit houses for the elderly would, it thinks, be particularly useful, given Japan's rapidly greying population. Perhaps most promising of all is a proposal to deregulate medical care, allowing private companies for the first time into the business. America has been particularly good at creating privatesector jobs in its health-care industry. America's business services are also seen as a model. These have blossomed as big companies have contracted out everything from accounting to catering. 
With the right measures, Japan might be able to replicate some of America's successes. But an earlier plan by Ryutaro Hashimoto, a former prime minister, to create 7.4m new jobs by 2010 has already been derailed, because vested interests and bureaucratic infighting blocked deregulation. Yet the alternative is bleak. Japan's companies, even its best exporters, will not keep their in-house unemployed for ever. They face competition from leaner foreign rivals, and several industries, such as finance and telecoms, are less protected than they were. If nerves are fraying now, imagine the angst if unemployment tripled. ","With ever more people jobless , Japan is rethinking the nature of employment

The more nebulous prospect of tax reform may slide off the government 's agenda entirely . 
 Then there is Keizo Obuchi's plan to create i m jobs , for which Keizo Obuchi is setting aside Yi trillion . So far , the government has given no details . Its record suggests it will once again pour money into the building industry through a lavish public - works programme . But jobs created this way vanish as quickly as they appear . Of the1 m jobs created in the building industry between 199o and 1997 , nearly half were lost when the government later cut public spending . 
 Together with Rengo , a big tradesunion association , Nikkeiren has proposed some alternative ways to create jobs . These include getting the unemployed to tidy up Japan 's cities and putting sacked staff into schools to teach about the world outside the classroom . More interestingly , Nikkeiren is calling for more money to be spent on Japan 's housing stock ; subsidies to refit houses for the elderly would , it thinks , be particularly useful , given Japan 's rapidly greying population . Perhaps most promising of all is a proposal to deregulate medical care , allowing private companies for the first time into the business . America has been particularly good at creating privatesector jobs in its health - care industry . America 's business services are also seen as a model . These have blossomed as big companies have contracted out everything from accounting to catering . 
 With the right measures , Japan might be able to replicate some of America 's successes . But an earlier plan by Ryutaro Hashimoto , a former prime minister , to create 7.4 m new jobs by 2010 has already been derailed , because vested interests and bureaucratic infighting blocked deregulation . Yet the alternative is bleak . Japan 's companies , even its best exporters , will not keep their in - house unemployed for ever . They face competition from leaner foreign rivals , and several industries , such as finance and telecoms , are less protected than they were . If nerves are fraying now , imagine the angst if unemployment tripled .",740,Japan,A29-8200,IN TERM,True,"the prime minister , Keizo Obuchi",5,True

Cut taxes, he is told, so that the Japanese will spend more money stoking up the economy and importing goods. Mr Obuchi knows all that. But his Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) does not have a majority in the upper house of the Diet parliament) Without more political friends, it has little hope, on its own, of pasing the necessary legislation. 
In desperation, Mr Obuchi has turned to Ichiro Ozawa, who stormed out of the LDP six years ago and now runs the dwindling Liberal Party. He and his renegades have agreed to join the government in a coalition, but only after two months of wrangling. Mr Ozawa wanted the government to suspend Japan's 5% consumption tax until the economy recovered. The tax will stay, but to appease Mr Ozawa that revenue will be used strictly for welfare. Mr Obuchi also agreed to fresh tax breaks for home-owners and will give ground on security matters, another of Mr Ozawa's concerns. 
In return, the Liberal Party has agreed to back Mr Obuchi's proposed 9.3 trillion ($82 billion) package of tax cuts. Yet the LDP is still ten seats short of a majority in the upper house. Who else can Mr Obuchi look to for support for his tax plans and, indeed, for his longer-term survival as prime minister? With Naoto Kan's Democratic Party out to topple the government at the earliest opportunity and the Communists and Social Democrats unapproachable, the only group left with which to do a deal is the Komeito-Kaikaku, the second-largest voting block on the opposition side. 
The LDP proposes to cut the top individual tax rate from 65% to 5o%. Extra tax breaks will be made available for buying land, housing and cars, as well as child care. To help the lower paid, the lowest taxable income for a family with two children will be raised from Y3.6m a year to Y4.gm. 
The trouble is that the Komeito-Kaikaku believes some 80% of Japanese households will not benefit enough from these changes to start spending more. This is despite Japan's minimum tax threshold remaining considerably higher than in other rich countries (see chart). Direct taxation in Japan accounts for 70% of all tax revenue. 
The LDP is nervous about shifting the burden more to indirect taxation. It bungled the introduction of a 3% consumption tax a decade ago, causing it to lose its upperhouse majority for the first time. When it raised the tax to go% in 1997, the economy slipped back into recession and it took another electoral pasting. The last thing the LDP leaders want to hear now is any suggestion of raising the consumption tax again. 
Enter Akiko Yamanaka, a Kaikaku member and a former professor of international affairs. She is a keen supporter of indirect taxes and wants (as Mr Ozawa did) the consumption tax suspended for up to two years, but then reintroduced at 5% with exemptions for food, medicine, health care and spending on children. The net effect, says Mrs Yamanaka, would be a Y15 trillion boost for the economy. She would pay for it by adopting a less wasteful system of government budgeting. The coalition's need to court the Komeito-Kaikaku is such that, even though Mrs Yamanaka is a firsttermer from a minor opposition group, her ideas are getting a surprising amount of attention from the LDP'S leadership.

1999-02-27,https://www-proquest-com.proxy.uchicago.edu/abicomplete/docview/224077665/fulltext/BD5C9B35475D4244PQ/10?accountid=14657,"Urged on by America, Japan is planning a broader role for its self-defence forces both in Asia and in trouble-spots elsewhere 
THE North Korean submarine, sent to land saboteurs south of the demilitarised zone, flees as South Korean helicop ters and warships race towards it. Afraid to shoot his own crew, scuttle the vessel and then commit suicide, the North Korean commander does the next best thing to avoid capture: he heads south into Japanese waters. Officers of Japan's Self-Defence Forces (SDF) watch the submarine and its hunters approach on their radar screens. The hot-line buzzes between Tokyo and Seoul. Eventually, the South Korean warships are told to call off the chase. 
This sequence of events was played out recently by think-tanks in Tokyo and Seoul. It revealed the glaring inadequacies in Japan's existing security arrangements, which are based on how it interprets its war-renouncing constitution: although Japan is allowed to defend its own territory, the SDF is barred from engaging in the collective use of force to settle international disputes. The war game's conclusion: since Japan lacked the military wherewithal to capture the intruding submarine, the government would have had to call Washington for help. But using American warships assigned to assist South Korea under a mutual defence treaty between those two countries had to be rejected. Further consultation was needed to mobilise American forces stationed in Japan under its own defence pact with the United States. As the talking continued, the North Korean sub marine slipped away. 
With the end of the cold war, Japan finds itself in a region that contains many of the world's most dangerous flashpoints. As a result, the war games are becoming increasingly real. Indeed, on December 18th the South Korean navy gave chase to a North Korean submarine and sank it just 50 kilometres (3o miles) outside Japanese waters. The government in Tokyo breathed a sigh of relief Yet japan is now having to consider how its forces should take a more active part in the security of the region. 
At the heart of the debate is the country's unique constitution. It has been both a blessing and a curse. In an effort to head off the Japanese government's timid reworking of the old Meiji constitution from 1890 that vested supreme power in a divine emperor, the allied occupation rushed out a version of its own during a hectic week in 1946. It placed sovereign power squarely with the people and relegated the emperor to a purely symbolic role. The parliamentary democracy it helped to create laid the foundations for Japan to emerge as a modern economic superpower. 
Article 9 of the constitution (see below) renounces war, though does not rule out japan defending its homeland from attack. Though this has done much to reassure Japan's neighbours, who suffered terribly under past Japanese militarism, the future role of Japan's forces will depend on how the constitution is reinterpreted or changed. Some argue that under the present interpretation even the SDF is illegal. Yet a 1959 Supreme Court ruling refused to find the sDF unconstitutional because it contributes to the self-defence,of the country. Other guidelines put in place since Japan signed a joint security treaty with the United States in 1960 prescribe how both countries should respond to defend Japan from an attack Defence remains the cornerstone of the policy. As a result, Japan has no bombers, long-range missiles, aircraft carriers or other means of projecting power beyond its own territory. 
Under the treaty, Japan relies on the American air force, navy and marine units to which it plays host to protect Japanese interests in the surrounding region. Precise legal conditions to allow Japanese sDF units to provide certain types of support to American forces in times of emergency were spelt out in a set of operational guidelines in 1978. 
Two years ago, the Americans began to encourage the Japanese to do more for stability in the region. This followed growing concern about regional dangers: a starving North Korea, which could be a military threat, or an increasingly assertive China, which has territorial disputes with other countries and a long struggle with Taiwan, which it considers a renegade province. 
In 1997, Japan agreed to broaden the role the SDF could play in supporting American troops in emergencies in unspecified ""areas surrounding Japan"". The official line in Tokyo is that the ""surrounding areas"" will depend on the situation and are not predetermined geographically. But such calculated ambiguity fools no one. The region referred to includes the Korean peninsula, Taiwan and areas south to the Philippines. This set alarm bells ringing.Whereas the South Koreans are merely wary of any military role for Japan in their affairs, the Chinese have been distinctly unhappy, claiming the new guidelines represent ""cold-war thinking"" designed to contain China. 
The issue has also caused controversy in Japan, where many believe that allowing the sDF to play a bigger part in regional emergencies is unconstitutional. This has so far inhibited the ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) from pushing the necessary legislation through the Japanese Diet (parliament). The required bills have been pending since last April. They would allow the SDF to provide American forces with back-up, such as logistical support (including helping to move American ammunition) outside a combat zone, search-and-rescue and the inspection of foreign ships suspected of aiding an enemy. 
Some Japanese believe the only way to enact the new guidelines would be to reinterpret or amend the constitution. This is where Japan splits. In one corner are the nationalists, who still bristle that the constitution was imposed on Japan by foreigners, and welcome what they see as an opportunity for Japan to gain a wholly new constitution of its own. In another corner are the conservatives who argue mostly that the constitution is fine, but may need tweaking in a few places so that Japan can do its share of the dirty work when the UN calls for help. Then there are the liberals. Apart from holding the country's hot-heads in check, they argue that the American-inspired constitution has given the Japanese people an inalienable set of human rights that officials would never have surrendered had they been left to their own devices. To accommodate the new security guidelines, Japanese liberals may grudgingly allow a slight reinterpretation of the constitution's existing wording. 
All this raises the spectre of Japanese rearmament among the neighbouring countries, many of which have their own bitter memories of japan's rampaging imperial army. Nevertheless, Japan does have interests beyond its own coastal waters. Some go% of Japan's oil crosses through the South China Sea. If China ever sought to choke off these vital sea lanes,Japan would feel compelled to seek American help with the surveillance and mine-sweeping needed to ensure the safety of its shipping. 
The original defence guidelines were designed to counter the Soviet threat. With that no longer credible, the new ones have been devised with two principal regional conflicts in mind-one between China and Taiwan, and the other on the Korean peninsula. Other potential flashpoints between China and its neighbours include the disputed Senkaku islands (called Diaoyu in China) off Taiwan and the Spratly islands near the Philippines. For now, however, the main headache is a hostile and unstable North Korea. 
America would like the new guidelines in place quickly and without being watered down, so there can be no lingering questions about Japanese resolve to help a bit more should North Korea launch suicidal attacks. Now that the new budget has cleared the lower house, Keizo Obuchi, the Japanese prime minister, wants the Diet to debate the guidelines as swiftly as possible. Mr Obuchi is under pressure to have something to show President Clinton when he visits Washington in May. 
Not so fast 
Yet the necessary legislation will not be passed smoothly. Even with the support of a new coalition partner, Mr Obuchi is still ten seats short of a majority in the 252seat upper chamber. The ruling party will have to do a deal with the New Komeito, the second-largest opposition party, if not Naoto Kan's bigger Democratic Party. But with a flurry of local elections scheduled for April, the opposition does not want to be seen to be in cahoots with what many voters would regard as a bunch of right-wingers. Once the local elections are out of the way, however, the debate on constitutional reform will gather pace. 
Several things have increased the hubbub in Japan about revising the constitution. One has been the way the end of the cold war and the collapse of the Soviet empire has rendered the old Socialist Party of Japan (now known as the Social Democratic Party) irrelevant. Until a few years ago, the ruling LDP could not hint at even a reinterpretation of Article 9 for fear of uproar from the Socialists-then a larger party and a member of the governing coalition.Today the Socialists have little influence. 
Another change has been the rise of the ultra-conservatives within the LDP and its new coalition partner, the small right-wing Liberal Party headed by Ichiro Ozawa. This has given renewed impetus to the right's cherished ambition to rewrite Article 9. The third factor fanning the flames for constitutional reform has been an increasing sense of danger. Leaked extracts of a Pentagon report suggest the Chinese intend to increase substantially the number of their missiles that are permanently aimed at Taiwan. But it is the belligerent regime in Pyongyang, suspected of restarting its programme to develop nuclear weapons, that is causing most concern. Fears came to a head last August when North Korea fired a three-stage rocket over Japan. America's Central Intelligence Agency believes the regime is preparing to test-fire a second one that could carry heavier payloads, such as biological or nuclear warheads. 
North Korea's provocation stung Japan into joining America's new Theatre Missile Defence (TMD) programme-which aims to track and shoot down incoming ballistic missiles within a 3,000-kilometre radius. The Japanese government is stumping up money to get TMD studies underway in April, and has revealed plans to spend up to Y30 billion ($25om) researching the new defence system over the next five years. If it could be made to work (at present a big if), the TMD would be able to reach out across China to the borders of Mongolia and Tibet and over the South China Sea to Thailand, Malaysia, Indonesia and the Philippines. It would be difficult for Japan to accommodate such a system within the existing phrasing of its constitution. 
The heightened tensions in East Asia have been grist to the mill for Mr Ozawa and the ultra-conservatives who want Japan to discard its inhibitions about sending troops abroad. Mr Ozawa has been a strong advocate of allowing sDF units to take part in UN peacekeeping operations ever since the Gulf war eight years ago. As number two in the LDP at the time, Mr Ozawa bullied the government into stump ing up $13 billion to help the coalition forces. But Japan got little thanks for its cheque-book diplomacy. 
The coalition partners have agreed that Japanese forces should be allowed to ""take part aggressively"" (though precisely what that means has been left vague) in UN peacekeeping operations around the world-provided two conditions are satisfied. There should be a resolution by the UN General Assembly or Security Council along with a request for Japan to join the peacekeeping operation. And the operation should not involve any direct use of force. That the second requirement would seem to conflict with the first is a measure of how delicate the phrasing has to be to appease constitutional nitpickers. 
Given the way the constitution is interpreted today, Japanese forces could not take part as combat units in a uN-sanctioned shooting war. Nor could they even supply-let alone transport-weapons, ammunition and other supplies. Any other form of participation would have to be agreed to by the Japanese government on a case-by-case basis. The Liberal Party's neonationalists interpret this to mean that, the two forbidden actions aside, everything else is admissible under the constitution. And as far as Mr Ozawa is concerned, even those are only temporary restrictions-imposed by the SDF'S own operational limitations. Others see it all quite differently. To them, the decades-old interpretation of Article 9 still stands. Thus the stage is set for a long and noisy clash over the future of the Japanese constitution, and not just over the role of the SDF (see box). 
So, what are the chances of Japanese troops leaving their shores once again? Although the new UN role may be tricky to get through the Diet, most expect the legislation for the updated guidelines governing co-operation with American forces to squeak through, even if in a slightly modified form. The consensus view is that these rules will rely on a reinterpretation of an unamended Article 9. The hardest issue will be whether the Diet's approval is needed before or after sDF units are deployed outside Japanese territory. 
The ruling party and its coalition partner agree that it would be nonsense to try to seek approval before sending Japanese soldiers on such missions. The two main opposition parties want prior approval, but would probably accept that, in an emergency, the Diet's permission could be sought afterwards. The process will be messy, but the day is approaching when Japanese forces will be dispatched for a modest role on multinational peacekeeping operations. Though there are concerns among some of Japan's neighbours about where this might lead, engaging Japan in a more active way in support of Asia's stability should make the region a safer place.

""THIS is not an auto show,"" said Bob Rewey, head of marketing at Ford Motor Company, surveying the stands at the Geneva Motor Show this week. ""It's a bazaar. These guys are all trying to buy and sell each other."" Within 24 hours, the haggling over the latest prize, Nissan, broke out into the open. DaimlerChrysler announced on March 10th that it had walked away from negotiations to buy a big stake in the Japanese car maker, which is struggling under Y4.3 trillion ($36 billion) of debt, while Renault made it publicly clear that it was keener than ever. 
The DaimlerChrysler deal fell through mostly because due diligence revealed the full horror of the debts that had been ""floated off"" to subsidiaries' subsidiaries. This is an old trick for cleaning up a company's balance sheet in Japan, where the law does not require full consolidation of profits and losses made by subsidiaries that are less than 50% owned. 
Industry gossip suggests that the nastiest surprises were at Nissan Diesel Motor Sales (NDMS), the sales arm of Nissan Diesel, the lorry company which was DaimlerChrysler's original target. Earlier this week, Nissan announced that it was boosting the capital of NDMs-a desperate measure, observers believe, to keep it afloat. 
The day before DaimlerChrysler withdrew, Renault's chairman, Louis Schweitzer, briefed journalists on his enthusiasm for a Nissan deal. He admitted that he had been to Tokyo frequently since November, hinted that the Japanese government might help fix Nissan's debt problems, and then ostentatiously started his tour of the show with a visit to the humble Nissan stand in the shadow of the magnificent Renault spread. When news of the withdrawal came through, he confirmed that Renault was still keen. 
Even though Renault has transformed its fortunes with jazzy models, rising market share and improving profits, it is still a small regional company, over-dependent on Europe. Merging with Nissan would give it 5% of the American market, which it abandoned in the 1980s, plus 17% of the Japanese market. In Europe a merger would boost its 11% share to 14%, without much overlap, since the Japanese car maker is stronger in the northern European markets where the French group is relatively weak. 
Although Nissan people had tremendous respect for DaimlerChrysler, they do not have the same feeling for Renault. ""Renault [is] in some ways no better off than Nissan in terms of future viability and survival,"" acknowledges a management assessment that has been widely circulated at Nissan-candid about Renault's weaknesses, but apparently in denial about the threats to Nissan. But Renault has its attractions: while DaimlerChrysler wanted control, Nissan executives believe that the French would make do with a big stake, leaving Nissan bosses in their jobs. 
If a deal is to be done, it is likely to be a shotgun wedding before Nissan spreads further gloom by reporting a 3o billion ($25om) loss at the end of the month. The government may well help. It faces an election within the next i8 months, and the prime minister, Keizo Obuchi, wants no more big bankruptices. 
As for DaimlerChrysler, many observers believe the company still longs to do a deal in Japan. ""At the end of the day,"" says Nick Lobaccaro, an analyst at Merrill Lynch investment bank in New York, ""Schrempp [DaimlerChrysler's chief executive] will get an Asian carmaker, and it could be Mitsubishi, with which Chrysler has long had a relationship."" In the early 198os, Mitsubishi's assistance, in the form of products, parts and technical know-how, helped a near-bankrupt Chrysler survive. Now, with Mitsubishi struggling, it could be the other way round. ","Nissan's suitors

The economy is fixed, says the Japanese government. But do consumers buy it? 
IN POLITICS, goes a Japanese saying, darkness begins just in front of you. Yet suddenly the view ahead seems clear and bright for Japan's leaders. Last week, the finance minister, Kiichi Miyazawa, discovered that the economy would grow again in May, to coincide conveniently with a planned trip to America by the prime minister, Keizo Obuchi. Mr Obuchi has also spied recovery. After the longest recession since the second world war, ""the economy has hit bottom,"" he declared. 
Mr Obuchi is probably right. The latest economic figures are still miserable (see chart), but the government is now spending so freely that the months ahead do promise better. Even the perennially optimistic Economic Planning Agency, which has been feeling the ""fetal stirrings of recovery"" for some months (a phantom pregnancy, say the cynics), is commanding some attention. Its cheery boss, Taichi Sakaiya, takes heart from higher sales of small cars and white goods (such as fridges and micro wave ovens) and increases in the price of golf-club memberships. Mr Sakaiya even foresees a minor housing boom. The sales are not yet registered, he says, but recent housing exhibitions have pulled big crowds. 
After last summers policy drift, the ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) deserves a bit of the credit. Mr Obuchi has brought in a huge programme of financial support for small companies, trillions more yen more for public works for the building industry, tax breaks and other goodies for house-buyers and, this month, a politically awkward bank bail-out. Yet for all the politicians' talk of growth, those with the biggest say will be Japanese consumers, whose spending makes up threefifths of the economy. Their worries will ensure that, even if growth resumes, the recovery will be fragile. 
Some things are undeniably cheering the shoppers. The government now seems to have got on top of the banks' troubles, so savers' worries that their hard-earned deposits could vanish with the next collapse of a financial company are fading. Thanks to a programme of cheaper loans for small businesses, bankruptcies among such companies are becoming rarer too. Last year, 1,600 companies went bust each month, but the numbers have been falling steeply recently and should continue to do so. Meanwhile government lenders, like the Japan Development Bank, are handing out cheap money to car makers, steel companies and supermarket chains, further easing fears about jobs. 
Yet no matter how much money the government dishes out, it cannot halt a sharp rise in unemployment, already at record levels. Japanese companies probably employ 4m-5m too many people. Until now, managerial timidity, a lingering belief in providing jobs for life and fear of bad publicity have kept these workers in jobs. But as the recession has bitten deeper, attitudes have begun to change. Everyone expects global giants like Sony to copy ruthless American rivals-and the firm did not disappoint this month by announcing plans for 17,000 job losses. News that other big companies are planning to do the same, including high-tech NEC, which wants to cut its payroll by 15,000, is far more unsettling. That 15 of Japan's biggest banks, all of them friends of the LDP and managerial backwaters, are losing 20,000 jobs is deeply skocking. If Japanese companies rid themselves of only half of their ""in-house unemployed"", the jobless rate will double, to nearly 9%. 
There is another big worry besides jobs. So far, it is the government that has been doing most of the spending. So, what happens when it stops? Companies, as well as shoppers, have been pinching the pennies, reversing years of over-investment fuelled by cheap debt; everywhere plans for new factories and machinery have been abandoned, though Japanese firms still invest far more in recession than their rivals in booming America. 
Mr Miyazawa now says the government has done all it can for the economy and that it is up to the private sector to provide growth. This is largely nonsense. The government has yet to embark on most of the economic deregulation it has long promised. But it is true that the government's debts are now so mountainous that extra spending, if it pushed up interest rates, would do more harm than good. The recent sharp rise in interest rates may well have been caused by the government's latest spending boost: investors reckoned inflation would surely follow. One way to keep rates low might be for the central bank to start printing more money. But the bank is reluctant. Better that Japan should feel pain and reform its ways, reckons the bank, than that it should prop up a failed system. 
All of which, surprisingly, is good news both for the economy and for Mr Obuchi. Painful restructuring soothed by the balm of public spending is about the best Japan can hope for at the moment. Eventually, as Japanese companies get back into shape, a proper recovery should follow. Perversely, a dramatic improvement could lead to trouble: strong growth, and the easing of pain that would come with it, might well cause companies to put off reform yet again. Mr Obuchi, meanwhile, will go into the LDP'S leadership contest this autumn with public money enlivening the economy and a rather impressive policy record. Not long ago he was given no hope of re-election. Now, the talk is that he will be unopposed. ","TOKYO

In poll after poll for prefectural and municipal assemblies, the winners were independent candidates who shunned any backing from the major parties or else played down their own affiliations. Unquestionably, the biggest disaster for the LDP was the trouncing of its candidate in the important race for governor of Tokyo. Shintaro Ishihara, the author of ""A Japan That Can Say No"", running as an independent, walked off with that. He was backed not only by the bulk of Tokyo's large floating vote but also by nearly half of the LDP'S own supporters. 
Even though local elections focus more on personalities, the extent to which Japanese voters have been shunning the mainstream political parties of late has made both the LDP and its two biggest rivals, the Democratic Party of Japan and the New Komeito, equally nervous. 
While the independents gained 12% more seats, the LDP'S share of seats slipped by 2%-even though the party fielded more candidates than ever. The message the party's barons have taken home is that now is not a time to do anything rash. Keizo Obuchi, the prime minister, and his LDP handlers were beginning to lay the ground work for an early general election. The government has to go to the country before October 2000. Mr Obuchi was counting on his modest but steady increase in popularityalong with the glimmer of economic recovery that officials swear they can detect-to call a snap election before the unemployment rate turns really nasty. Whether the spark of recovery catches hold or not, the current level of joblessness (already a record 4.6%) is set to soar as Japanese firms prepare for new accounting rules and finally get down to restructuring in earnest. 
But without a successful snap election to prolong his term as prime minister, Mr Obuchi will have to get himself re-elected as party president in September. The party elected Mr Obuchi last July to serve out the balance of Ryutaro Hashimoto's two-year term after he had resigned. With a number of senior LDP members, including the former secretary-general, Koichi Kato, now itching to have their turn as prime minister, a September election for the party leadership could prove to be a bloody affair. 
Hence all the talk emanating from the prime minister's office this week about either getting Mr Obuchi an automatic oneyear extension to his present term of office, or bringing the party election forward to July. While an extension is probably out of the question, an earlier party election would make a world of difference to the amount of support Mr Obuchi could muster. 
With its 93 members, Mr Obuchi's own faction is still the largest block within the LDP. But ranged against him would be the 7o members in Mr Kato's group plus allies from the 62-strong faction led by Yoshiro Mori and the 31 members loyal to Taku Yamasaki. However, were he to move smartly, Mr Obuchi could wrap up support from a new right-wing grouping that came together in February when two senior LDP conservatives, Masakuni Murakami and Shizuka Kamei, pooled their factional interests. Getting the new Murakami-Kamei faction's 70 members to throw their weight behind the prime minister could even up the odds. The price could be a handful of senior posts. 
If Mr Obuchi does succeed in getting himself re-elected as party president in July, the LDP'S majority in the lower house means he will automatically get a second term as prime minister. His problem then will be when to call a general election. With nearly half the electorate now demonstrating its total disillusionment with mainstream politics, the prime minister will have to pull a very special rabbit out of the hat when he finally goes to the country in, say, a year's time. The one bit of magic capable of winning back the LDP'S errant voters would be solid evidence that the economy was on the mend. But that might require yet another big splurge of public spending.

IT WAS just plain bad luck that attention was elsewhere when Keizo Obuchi, Japan's prime minister, arrived in Washington for his carefully planned summit with Bill Clinton on May 3rd. This was supposed to have been the highlight of Mr Obuchi's six-day tour of America-the first official visit by a Japanese prime minister in 12 years. But three American soldiers held captive in Yugoslavia had just been released and Russia's Balkan envoy, Viktor Chernomyrdin, was about to brief Mr Clinton, so Mr Obuchi had to stand idly by as impatient reporters quizzed the president about Kosovo. Judging from America's evening news programmes, the summit meeting between the leaders of the world's two largest economies passed almost unnoticed. 
Mr Obuchi, hoping to use his trip to America to bolster his chances of a second term in office, may also have been disappointed at the similarly poor coverage of his visit on Japanese television. Nevertheless, he returned to Tokyo with one valuable piece of political ammunition. In much friendlier tones than expected, Mr Clinton had praised the Japanese prime minister for making great efforts to revive Japan's economy from its longest recession since the second world war. The American president then urged Japan to continue its pump-priming measures using ""all available tools"" until there were signs of sustained growth. The Japanese government believes the economy has hit bottom, but any such recovery will remain fragile unless Japanese consumers are confident enough to start spending again. 
In public, the prime minister's entourage was quick to point out that the White House was not actually calling on Japan to do anything more than it had already. But in the world of international financeamong the finance ministers of the G7 (the rich countries' club), the IMF and the American Treasury-""all available tools"" means only one thing: ""Throw the kitchen sink at it,"" if that is what is needed to get Japan's economy back on its feet. 
Ajob on the line 
Mr Obuchi has staked his career on turning the economy round within a year. His time is limited because he is serving out the balance of his predecessor's term (Ryutaro Hashimoto was forced to stand down after the hammering the ruling Liberal Democratic Party, the LDP, received in an upperhouse election last July). After seeing Japan's economy shrink for two years in a row, Mr Obuchi promised to deliver real growth of 0.5% in the financial year to March 2000. To achieve that, he introduced tax cuts and public-works programmes worth Y24 trillion ($198 billion) last November, and provided a further Y60 trillion to bail out Japan's debt-ridden banks. He then pushed through a record Y82 trillion budget in March. As a result, the economy's deflationary descent has been arrested-at least for the time being. 
But not much more than that has been achieved. Most economists in Japan expect the effects of the measures to fizzle out by late summer. Without any further stimulus, the economy may then begin to shrink again. That would be disastrous for the Japanese prime minister. Under party rules, Mr Obuchi's term in office expires in September. In the absence of an early general election, his only chance of keeping his job is to get himself re-elected as party president. But the LDP has many rival factions and others believe it is now their turn to lead the party, and thus have the prime minister's job. 
Another economic collapse would be especially disastrous for the LDP itself, which has to call a general election sometime before October 20oo. Few give the ruling party much of a chance if the economy has failed to pick up by then and official unemployment, already at a record 4.8%, has continued to soar. Taichi Sakaiya, head of the governments Economic Planning Agency, has been quietly warning his cabinet colleagues that unemployment could hit 5.2% later this year as companies, unable to rely on hard-pressed banks for loans, are obliged to ""restructure"" frantically to stay alive. With more than 4m surplus workers, corporate Japan could easily put 2m people on to the street by this time next year, sending the unemployment figure to an unimaginable 7%. 
That is why Mr Clinton's words were music to the prime minister's ears. Mr Obuchi now has a legitimate excuse to fling more money at the economy-and to do so before the end of the summer. No one in Mr Obuchi's inner circle will admit publicly that there is even a need for it. The official line remains that the Japanese economy is on course for recovery. Besides, even to suggest that the government was working on a fresh set of tax cuts and public-works programmes would send long-term interest rates skyward again. The bond market is still trying to digest the glut of government bonds issued to pay for last November's measures, let alone the bumper budget in March. 
That has not stopped Mr Obuchi's rivals from airing their own views on what needs to be done. Koichi Kato, who heads a rival faction within the LDP and is Mr Obuchi's main challenger for the party leadership, has been telling anyone who will listen that the government will have to inject a further Y15 trillion if the economy is to grow by 0.5% this year. But, given Japan's ballooning national debt, most agree with Shizuka Kamei, a conservative power-broker in the LDP, that io trillion is all the government can afford. 
So Mr Obuchi can be expected to start hinting about a new splurge after the G7 summit in Germany in June. An extraordinary parliamentary session will then be called for September, ostensibly to pass a bunch of job-creation and companyrestructuring proposals that the Ministry of International Trade and Industry is beavering away on. The session's main purpose, however, will be to pass a new supplementary budget with another io trillion to shove Japan's economy a bit farther along the road to recovery. With that, Mr Obuchi might get his chance to stay in office for another year.

RUMOUR mills in Japan have been working overtime, claiming that the most powerful man in Japanese politics is dead or dying. Noboru Takeshita, a former prime minister and the ageing don of the ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP), has not been seen for six weeks. Aides refuse to divulge which hospital he was admitted to in early April, ostensibly for a spinal complaint, saying only that he refuses to see visitors because of the trouble it would cause. Even Ryutaro Hashimoto, another ex-prime minister and a close associate, has been turned away. 
The popular press has jumped to the conclusion that, like several senior contemporaries in the LDP who spent their final months in hospital while being treated for ""minor"" complaints, Mr Takeshita is probably dying. Even if his illness is not so serious, his long absence from the political scene and the increasing likelihood that he will never fully regain his powers are sending shivers through the office of the prime minister, Keizo Obuchi. He was banking on Mr Takeshita's support to get the ruling party to appoint him to another term as prime minister when his present one expires in September. The questions now being asked are who among the LDP's gerontocracy will step into Mr Takeshita's shoes, and what therefore are Mr Obuchi's chances for a second term. 
The LDP has always had a shadowy figure who wields real power from behind the scenes-giving the nod to appointments, buying off the opposition, dealing with the underworld and pulling the strings of the prime minister. The job is usually claimed by a senior member of the party's largest faction. When the late Kakuei Tanaka-the most effective ""Shogun in the dark"" in recent times-began to lose his grip in 1987, the scary Shin Kanemaru assumed the role, anointing his protege, Mr Takeshita, as prime minister and arranging for him to take over the Tanaka faction. In turn, when Kanemaru fell from grace in 1992, Mr Takeshita became the party's kingmaker, handing the largest faction over to one of his own disciples, Mr Obuchi, and ensuring that he subsequently became prime minister. 
Mr Obuchi has been at pains to point out that his 75-year-old mentor still has all his wits about him and will be up and about again shortly. The prime minister told reporters recently that, before he left for his summit with Bill Clinton on May 3rd, Mr Takeshita called him from his hospital bed to dispense advice. 
Yet Mr Takeshita has already missed several crucial events that his aides were confident he would attend. If he fails to turn up for the emperor's garden party on May 19th, where he is supposed to be one of the guests of honour, then the prime minister really could find himself in trouble. He already has a number of rivals in the LDP who think it is their turn to be prime minister. Meanwhile, it has not escaped the notice of some that the followers of Takeda Shingen, a wily 16th-century warlord of what is now Yamanashi prefecture who was also Japan's greatest strategist, managed to keep their master's death a secret for three years while they consolidated power.

THE deal was supposed to have been done. The New Komeito, Japan's second largest opposition party, would join forces with the ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) to provide Keizo Obuchi's governing alliance with the majority it lacks in the upper house of the Diet (parliament). The Buddhist-affiliated New Komeito was expected to join the prime minister's coalition government, though not his cabinet. However, events of the past week have shown just how dangerous it can be for opposition parties to flirt with the LDP. 
Worried about its chances should a snap election be called later this year, the New Komeito had been hoping to influence plans for altering the way constituencies are drawn up. To gain favour, it threw its weight behind the government's controversial bills for beefing up Japan's security pact with America, ensuring that they passed the upper house. But carefully laid plans for a grand alliance have started to come apart. Conservatives in the coalition took it for granted that, with the New Komeito in their pocket, they could press on with getting one of their pet hobbyhorses into law: having the Hinomaru (""Rising Sun"") flag and the Kimigayo (""His Majesty's Reign"") anthem adopted legally as national symbols. The aim is to make their use mandatory at all official occasions-especially in schools. But each time they try, the powerful national teachers' union says it infringes students' rights as guaranteed by the post-war constitution. 
Although both the flag and the anthem go back a century or more, neither was adopted officially as a national symbol after the second world war because of the embarrassing part they played in bolstering fascism during the 193os and because of the atrocities committed in their name. 
Each year at graduation ceremonies, an almighty row breaks out between the education authorities, who insist that the flag be flown and the anthem sung, and a hard core of teachers who refuse to do so. Last February this led one headmaster, caught in the middle, to commit suicide. It allowed Mr Obuchi to be persuaded that a law was needed to resolve the ambiguous nature of the flag and anthem. Eager to please, the New Komeito's leadership agreed to back the legislation. 
But that was before Takenori Kanzaki, the New Komeito's boss, talked to his own rank and file-not to mention his party's main financial backers, the deep-pocketed Soka Gakkai. Many of this gm-strong lay Buddhist support group hold Japan's postwar pacifist constitution as sacred, and refuse to have the Kimigayo as their national anthem. Ten of the New Komeito's younger Diet members also dropped heavy hints that they would defect. 
Chastened, the New Komeito has begun to back away from its embrace of the LDP. To all intents and purposes, the bill to make the flag and anthem official is now dead. More significantly, however, few of the New Komeito's members now have any illusions about the LDP helping them in an election.

TOKYO 
WHISPER it quietly, or better still, not at all: Japan is planning yet more emergency spending to revive its sickly economy. Since late last year, when yields on Japanese government bonds tripled, Keizo Obuchi, the prime minister, and his economic advisers have at times seemed in the shadow of a volcano. Miserable tax revenues and a huge public-works programme have saddled Japan with monstrous debts-so monstrous, in fact, that this winter's interest-rate rise inspired fears in Tokyo of a government-debt crisis. For a time, soothing words and looser money helped to massage rates lower. But now there is talk of another fiscal boost-- maybe in September, maybe worth as much as Y15 trillion ($124 billion)-and they are rising again. Despite the government's careful pussyfooting around its spending plans, the yield on the benchmark ten-year government bond rose to nearly 1.7% on June 2nd, a two-month high. 
Foreign nerves are fraying, too. The fear is that the government may soon lose command of its finances, or worse, that borrowing is already out of control. This is a potentially nightmarish view: a sudden loss of confidence, capital flight, soaring interest rates and a run on the yen. Just how much damage this would do to America, Europe and the rest of the world is anybody's guess. But the resulting shock could surely dwarf recent financial crises. As a result, the country is drawing harsh words from top economists. ""Japanese bonds deserve a junk rating,"" wrote Rudi Dombusch, of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, in the Wall Street Journal recently. ""The problem is out of control."" 
Why the feverish doomsaying? The numbers are undeniably awe-inspiring. This year, according to the finance ministry, gross public debt should hit 108.5% of GDP. Next year, by this measure, Japan will probably pip Italy as the most indebted economy in the G7 group of rich countries. The budget deficit rose to 6% of GDP last year and will probably surpass 8% this year if Mr Obuchi goes ahead with more public works this autumn. Finances as troubled as this cannot be repaired easily and the debt will grow for several years to come. By 2001, thinks the IMF, gross debt will be close to 140% of GDP. 
The scale of the government's gross debts is not in dispute. But opinions are, predictably enough, sharply divided about how much they matter. Some economists argue that the government's true indebtedness is much smaller, around 35% of GDP, because its assets should be offset against its liabilities. Most notably, the assets include the social-security funds that have piled up over many years of public-pension-fund surpluses. Others say the government's position is actually far worse than the gross figures suggest. By 2010, Japan's rapidly greying population will have pushed its pension system into the red; and, unless the system is reformed, it will stay there. The present value of these future unfunded obligations is more than 100% of GDP. 
In a report produced last October, the IMF sensibly argued that the truth lies somewhere between these extremes. The speed with which Japan's population is ageing and the size of its unfunded pension liabilities (they are similar to those in Germany and France) suggest that it is imprudent to treat social-security funds as if they can be diverted into servicing the national debt. On the other hand, Japan could reduce its future pension obligations by reforming the system. Indeed, the government has already floated several ways of doing this, including raising contributions, cutting benefits and raising the eligibility age from 60 to 65. 
But the net debt figure of around 70% of GDP (if social-security funds are excluded from the government's assets) may still be a serious underestimate. It omits hidden debts, the largest of which are buried in the books of the finance ministry's fiscal investment and loan programme, or zaito. This institution sucks up the nation's postal savings and pension funds, and lends the money to public-sector financial institutions, such as the Japan Development Bank and the Housing Loan Corporation, a mortgage lender, and to infrastructure projects. 
Just how savagely zaito's Y395 trillionworth of assets need writing down is impossible to judge from the skimpy information provided by the finance ministry. But two clues point to something pretty smelly. First, some of zaito's biggest clients, like the Housing Loan Corporation, require big annual operating subsidies to balance their books, suggesting less than rude health. Second, zaito has recently had to transfer Y28 trillionworth of its loans (mainly to the Japan National Railway Settlement Corporation, a company set up ten years ago to assume the debts of the privatised rail network) on to the government's books. As the true financial position of other zaito clients becomes clear, plenty more ""assets"" are sure to follow, perhaps adding up to 10-15% of GDP. 
The road less travelled 
Compared with other countries, this burden does not appear crushing. Five years ago, both Italy and Sweden had run up similar debts. Yet those investors, such as Skandia, a big Swedish insurance company, which sensed impending crisis and refused to buy the government's debt, missed out on a big bond-market rally as deficits and debts were brought under control. In 1946, debt-to-GDP ratios hit 120% in America and 260% in Britain without disaster striking. 
Ultimately, of course, it is up to bond investors to decide whether Japan's burden is bearable. If they begin to charge sharply higher interest rates, the government's debts will quickly spiraL But several factors make this unlikely. This year, the current-account surplus (which equals the surplus of domestic savings over investments) should be 3.4% of GDP, according to The Economist's poll of forecasters. High savings should ensure a healthy demand for bonds, which will also be snaffled up by Japan's distressed banks, as they cut their loan-books in the struggle to meet capital-adequacy requirements. 
At the same time, the expectation of deflation is taking root among Japanese firms, which are unwinding their debts and building up cash piles. According to the Bank of Japan, the flow of credit to the private sector shrank by Y44 trillion last year-an extraordinary 9% of GDP. So long as the flow of funds to private borrowers is weak, the government should easily find buyers for its debt. 
Also, most of the government's debts are owed to domestic institutions and to individuals. Unlike flighty foreign investors, they would naturally prefer to stay put. And foreign-currency debts, the proximate cause of the recent financial crises in most emerging markets, are negligible. (It is, however, rather far-fetched to claim, as the government sometimes does, that Japan's $1.1 trillionworth of net foreign assets, mostly owned by the private sector, should somehow be set against its public debts.) 
But however faithful its bond-buyers, the government will soon have to rein in the growth of its debts. The temptation in Japan is always to achieve this by giving in to the traditionally strong appetite for tight fiscal policy. That proved disastrous in 1997, when a premature tightening tipped the economy into its present recession. But, undaunted, the finance ministry, which opposes further stimulus this autumn, is threatening to make the same mistake again. 
If its economy was growing, Japan, where tax revenues are lower as a proportion of GDP than in any other of the G7 countries, would have scope for tax rises. In the current recession, however, a better approach might be thorough fiscal reform. This would start with the abolition of zaito, making the public lenders self-financing and combining zaito's myriad special accounts and corporations with the government's general account. Transparency would soothe those Japanese who fear that something really nasty lurks in zaito's books. It would also expose the allocation of public funds to a public-interest test (instead of the prevalent one, based on bureaucratic self-interest). 
Reform would be painful for the finance ministry, revealing years of mismanagement and concealed losses. Unless it is undertaken, however, good money will follow bad into the system, and zaito's hidden debts will continue to swell. That might not matter if the economy recovers strongly. In the early 1980s, Japan was able to repair the damage inflicted on its finances by the previous decade's two oil shocks without fundamental reform to its system of public finances. With the economy barrelling along, the finance ministry could simply cap spending and enjoy the swelling tax revenues. This time, however, few expect growth, when it resumes, to be nearly so robust. That argues for reform now, before it is too late.

 TOKYO 
 WHISPER it quietly , or better still , not at all : Japan is planning yet more emergency spending to revive its sickly economy . Since late last year , when yields on Japanese government bonds tripled , Keizo Obuchi and Keizo Obuchi's economic advisers have at times seemed in the shadow of a volcano . Miserable tax revenues and a huge public - works programme have saddled Japan with monstrous debts - so monstrous , in fact , that this winter 's interest - rate rise inspired fears in Tokyo of a government - debt crisis . For a time , soothing words and looser money helped to massage rates lower . But now there is talk of another fiscal boost-- maybe in September , maybe worth as much as Y15 trillion ( $ 124 billion)-and they are rising again . Despite the government 's careful pussyfooting around its spending plans , the yield on the benchmark ten - year government bond rose to nearly 1.7 % on June 2nd , a two - month high . 
 Foreign nerves are fraying , too . The fear is that the government may soon lose command of its finances , or worse , that borrowing is already out of control . This is a potentially nightmarish view : a sudden loss of confidence , capital flight , soaring interest rates and a run on the yen . Just how much damage this would do to America , Europe and the rest of the world is anybody 's guess . But the resulting shock could surely dwarf recent financial crises . As a result , the country is drawing harsh words from top economists . "" Japanese bonds deserve a junk rating , "" wrote Rudi Dombusch , of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology , in the Wall Street Journal recently . "" The problem is out of control . "" 
 Why the feverish doomsaying ? The numbers are undeniably awe - inspiring . This year , according to the finance ministry , gross public debt should hit 108.5 % of GDP . Next year , by this measure , Japan will probably pip Italy as the most indebted economy in the G7 group of rich countries . The budget deficit rose to 6 % of GDP last year and will probably surpass 8 % this year if Keizo Obuchi goes ahead with more public works this autumn . Finances as troubled as this can not be repaired easily and the debt will grow for several years to come . By 2001 , thinks the IMF , gross debt will be close to 140 % of GDP . 
 The scale of the government 's gross debts is not in dispute . But opinions are , predictably enough , sharply divided about how much they matter . Some economists argue that the government 's true indebtedness is much smaller , around 35 % of GDP , because its assets should be offset against its liabilities . Most notably , the assets include the social - security funds that have piled up over many years of public - pension - fund surpluses . Others say the government 's position is actually far worse than the gross figures suggest . By 2010 , Japan 's rapidly greying population will have pushed its pension system into the red ; and , unless the system is reformed , it will stay there . The present value of these future unfunded obligations is more than 100 % of GDP . 
 In a report produced last October , the IMF sensibly argued that the truth lies somewhere between these extremes . The speed with which Japan 's population is ageing and the size of its unfunded pension liabilities ( they are similar to those in Germany and France ) suggest that it is imprudent to treat social - security funds as if they can be diverted into servicing the national debt . On the other hand , Japan could reduce its future pension obligations by reforming the system . Indeed , the government has already floated several ways of doing this , including raising contributions , cutting benefits and raising the eligibility age from 60 to 65 . 
 But the net debt figure of around 70 % of GDP ( if social - security funds are excluded from the government 's assets ) may still be a serious underestimate . It omits hidden debts , the largest of which are buried in the books of the finance ministry 's fiscal investment and loan programme , or zaito . This institution sucks up the nation 's postal savings and pension funds , and lends the money to public - sector financial institutions , such as the Japan Development Bank and the Housing Loan Corporation , a mortgage lender , and to infrastructure projects . 
 Just how savagely zaito 's Y395 trillionworth of assets need writing down is impossible to judge from the skimpy information provided by the finance ministry . But two clues point to something pretty smelly . First , some of zaito 's biggest clients , like the Housing Loan Corporation , require big annual operating subsidies to balance their books , suggesting less than rude health . Second , zaito has recently had to transfer Y28 trillionworth of its loans ( mainly to the Japan National Railway Settlement Corporation , a company set up ten years ago to assume the debts of the privatised rail network ) on to the government 's books . As the true financial position of other zaito clients becomes clear , plenty more "" assets "" are sure to follow , perhaps adding up to 10 - 15 % of GDP .

A backlash begins against Japan's big public-spending plans 
PUBLIC works, runs the theory, are what holds Japan's loose polity together. The gravy from Tokyo keeps impoverished local governments servile, the bloated building industry sweet, the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) in office, and the bureaucrats who ladle out the stuff in power. Perhaps neglectfully for a parliamentary democracy, however, this theory omits the voter. That oversight helps explain the recent mass protests against unwanted dams, airports, roads and bridges that have suddenly broken out all over the country. 
In Shiga prefecture, which borders the Kansai city of Kyoto, residents want a referendum on plans for a new airport near Lake Biwa, a popular tourist haunt. The citizens of Kobe want to junk their city's plans for an intemational airport, too. They reason that, since there are already two other international airports within 40km (25 miles) of Kobe, the city does not need one of its own. Last November, Kobe's municipal assembly rejected calls for a referendum, but anti-airport groups have fought on, capturing a handful of assembly seats in local elections in April. Now they plan to collect signatures for a second petition and an appeal directly to the airport's most powerful sponsor, the transport ministry in Tokyo. 
In Yoshinagacho, in Okayama prefecture, residents have been battling to prevent the building of an industrial-waste disposal plant near their town. Last year, the prefectural government put the project on hold, infuriating the companies involved. They appealed to the health and welfare ministry, but on June 8th the ministry ruled in favour of the Okayama government's decision. 
Voters in Tokushima, on the island of Shikoku, are fighting construction-ministry bureaucrats over a new dam for the nearby Yoshino river. They may even have secured enough new anti-dam assembly members after the April elections to force a referendum. That would overturn a vote by the assembly in February against a referendum that was passed despite a supporting petition signed by loo,ooo residents, about half of the city's electorate. The battle has sparked some fiery words, at least by the standards of consensus-loving Japan. The construction ministry's man in Tokushima says that a referendum would be ""poisonous medicine"". Masayoshi Himeno, the leader of the antidam lobby, retorts with some sarcasm that, after the assembly's earlier rejection of a referendum, ""we came to realise that public works are not for the public."" 
One reason why these various projects have the locals up in arms is that they may harm the environment. Kobe wants to build its airport on a man-made island in the bay, which some worry would hurt marine wildlife. Opponents of the Tokushima dam argue that dams of similar design elsewhere have destroyed river habitats, blocking the flow of water and leading to an accumulation of sludge on the river bed. They also say that the dam threatens the wetlands at the river's mouth, which are home to migratory birds and the rare shiomaneki crab. 
More intriguingly, people worry about the drain that big projects have put on public finances. The Kobe city government wants to finance the building of its airport by issuing Y310 billion ($2.6 billion) of high-interest bonds. Anti-airport campaigners say that these bonds would land the city in deep financial trouble. Tokushima's dam will cost 03 billion to build, 60% of which must be found by the prefectural government. 
This touches a raw nerve in Japan as voters ponder the cost of the govemment's efforts to spend its way out of a recession, which ended (for now) in the three months to March when the economy grew by 1.9% compared with the previous quarter. Between 1992 and 1998, according to Nomura Securities, a stockbroker, Japan blew a staggering $750 billion on roads, bridges, dams and the like (see chart) to keep its economy ticking over. By next year,Japan will have replaced Italy as the most indebted nation in the Group of Seven rich countries. With the population both ageing and shrinking (the number of Japanese is due to fall by half by the end of the next century, according to the government), people are worrying about who is going to pay all of this money back. 
The prime minister, Keizo Obuchi, seems to have caught the public mood. Eschewing the LDP's traditional public-works remedies, he claims a new enthusiasm for ""supply-side"" reforms and was due to unveil new measures on June lth. These include labour-market measures and incentives for firms to shed excess capacity and debt. Cabinet ministers are suggesting there will be no big emergency budget for extra public works this autumn, despite earlier hints to the contrary. Instead, said the chief cabinet secretary, Hiromu Nonaka, the autumn budget would concentrate on creating new jobs. 
Perhaps also with his nose to the wind, Katsutsugu Sekiya, the construction minister, said in April that he would scrap plans for Tokushima's dam if residents voted against it, reversing his ministry's earlier position. Campaigners in Tokushima, Kobe, Yoshinagacho and in Shiga prefecture were delighted, but their celebrations did not last long. Under fire from Tokushima's mayor (a construction-ministry bureaucrat) and his own horrified officials, Mr Sekiya quickly withdrew his remarks. 
All is not quite lost, however. Last year, under the guiding hand of Mr Obuchi and to giggles elsewhere, the government introduced a new ""cost-benefit reassessment system"" to check public-works projects for ""transparency and efficiency"". Under this system, spending ministries must reassess their projects if construction work has not started within five years of their inception, and every five years thereafter. According to one official, by March this year the govemment had reassessed more than 8,000 projects. Of these, it had cancelled just 35. ","TOKUSHIMA

Daisaku Ikeda is the spiritual leader of the Soka Gakkai, a lay Buddhist group that can muster nearly 7m votes-a tenth of Japan's voting population (and a fifth of those who turn out in most elections). The Soka Gakkai's political arm, the New Komeito, is the second-largest opposition party in the Diet (parliament) and is notably influential in the upper house. That is a measure of Mr Ikeda's power. 
Now he is about to have more. On June 28th, the prime minister, Keizo Obuchi, took the first steps to get the New Komeito to join his coalition government. Since January, the ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) has governed with the help of Ichiro Ozawa's small right-wing group, the Liberals. But though the coalition has a majority in the lower house of the Diet, it is nine seats short in the upper house, making it difficult to pass controversial legislation. With its 52 members in the lower house and z4 in the upper house, the New Komeito would give Mr Obuchi a comfortable margin in both chambers-and, in the process, allow him to ignore Mr Ozawa's hectoring demands. 
On paper, the deal makes sense for the LDP. But many within his party are queasy about Mr Obuchi's willingness to team up with the Buddhists. The last time the Komeito tasted power-during a brief (non-LDP) coalition government headed by Morihiro Hosokawa in 1993-it was quick to block efforts to enforce the separation of church and state, as required by the constitution. 
Set up in 1930 by teachers who believed in ""value creation"" (soka) theories of education, much is made of the society's record of protecting minorities against oppression. The group's founder, Tsunesaburo Makiguchi, died in prison during the second world war after being persecuted for his opposition to state shintoism. 
After the war, the group transformed itself into a lay religious organisation, adopting the name Soka Gakkai (Value-Creation Society), and embracing the faith of the 700year-old Nichiren Shoshu sect. It won a wide following for offering practical and moral help to people who were coming off the land and out of the armed forces and trying to find work, food and a place to sleep in Japan's bombed-out cities. In 1952, the society was adopted by Nichiren Shoshu, with the job of propagating the religion and converting people to the faith. The Soka Gakkai was then little more than a Buddhist-equivalent of the Salvation Army. 
Nowadays, however, the Soka Gakkai realises that it went too far in 1991 when it allowed 300 of its young zealots to storm a temple in Fukuoka and beat up a worshipper and a priest who had criticised the group. That was the start of a war between the Soka Gakkai and Nichiren Shoshu, which later severed its ties with the Soka Gakkai and excommunicated Mr Ikeda. 
Having lost its main purpose, the Soka Gakkai now stresses its good works around the world. It gives generously to charities and campaigns for ""peace, culture and education"". Mr Ikeda took over the leadership in 1960 and soon formed the Komeito (Clean Government Party). He built the Soka Gakkai into the power it is today. Few demands, other than pecuniary ones, are made on Soka Gakkai's followers, who are taught to attain enlightenment and prosperity through chanting sacred phrases handed down from a 13th-century monk called Nichiren. A popular pastime is watching videos of Mr Ikeda mingling with the good, the great and the occasionally despotic, such as Cuba's Fidel Castro. 
Clearly, the society provides an attractive support system for people in need. It has around 9m members (mostly housewives), almost 1.3m of whom are abroad. It is particularly strong in Osaka and Tokyo. Well-informed outsiders put the group's wealth at more than Y10 trillion ($82 billion). The money comes from donations, the sale of burial plots, rent from property, and its newspaper, Seikyo Shimbun, whose circulation is 5.5m. 
But, like many organisations that have grown fat and lost sight of their original purpose, the Soka Gakkai protects its interests with a ruthlessness that has frightened off critics and cowed the Japanese mainstream media into silence. It tolerates no criticism whatsoever of Mr Ikeda, who elevated himself to honorary chairman after a series of scandals in the 1970s. Detractors claim that the organisation acts like a cult, threatening people with hell and damnation if they try to leave. In inviting the New Komeito into the coalition, Mr Obuchi may find he has more on his hands than the couple of dozen upper-house votes he bargained for.

THOSE who argue that Japanese business is mending its ways often point to such men as Yoshihiko Miyauchi. As chief executive of Orix, a youthful and successful financial-services company, Mr Miyauchi has turned heads in the stuffy world of Japanese banking. Recently he has shown interest in buying Long-Term Credit Bank, an insolvent lender that the government was forced to nationalise and now wishes to sell. Most eyecatching, however, is the way Mr Miyauchi manages his firm. Orix, he declares, is in business to make a profit-a bold assertion in a country where capitalist attitudes are muddied by a sense that a company has wider responsibilities to society and to the state. 
Mr Miyauchi is well placed to make his reforming voice heard. He is vice-chairman of the Keizai Doyukai, Japan's association of company directors, and a councillor of the Keidanren, the big-business association. He chairs a cabinet committee charged with finding ways to deregulate the economy. He helped to found a lobby for boardroom reform. He fights for smaller government, competitive markets and international standards of management. 
From his message and his ubiquity, you might conclude that Mr Miyauchi is a firebrand, fed up with Japan's corporate and political establishment. His thinking is refreshingly clear-headed. He has no time for the empty nationalist rhetoric of such people as Eisuke Sakakibara, a recently retired bureaucrat once known as Mr Yen, who tended to echo the Meiji-era slogan ""Japanese spirit, Western knowledge"" with its emphasis on everything that sets Japan apart. 
Yet Mr Miyauchi is hardly an ardent revolutionary. He is modest and soft-spoken. He reserves a warm smile for Japan's prime minister, Keizo Obuchi, who shares some of his qualities. And like Mr Obuchi, his grand project seems to lack vitality. Nobody doubts what Mr Miyauchi wants for his company and for the Japanese economy. The worry is over how urgently he wants it. 
Mr Miyauchi's entire career has unfolded at a dignified pace. He trained in America, where he studied for an MBA. Shortly afterwards, in i964, he joined Orix (then called Orient Leasing). The economy grew quickly, and so did demand for the leased officeequipment in which Orient specialised. By the time Mr Miyauchi took control in 198o, however, the economy had slowed, and with it the leasing market. Mr Miyauchi chose to diversify-not haphazardly, as so many Japanese companies did, but into finance, most recently into discount broking, direct banking and life insurance. Deregulation is stimulating competition to manage Japan's vast savings, he reasons. As long as traditional finance firms offer only undifferentiated products at standard prices, an inventive niche firm such as Orix can do well. 
Meanwhile, Mr Miyauchi has been revamping Orix's management, introducing share options for executives and promoting staff on merit, rather than length of service. In April he said that his board of 17 directors would shrink by more than half, with three of the remaining seats reserved for outsiders, a rare and controversial mixture in Japan. All this has gone down well with foreign investors, who now own more than a third of the company. As they have built up their stakes, Orix shares have comfortably outperformed the Tokyo market: they recently hit an all-time high (see chart). 
Slow coach 
Japan has too few thinkers like Mr Miyauchi. Yet even he has failed to get his company far in its 15-year quest to diversify out of Japan's mature leasing business. Leasing still accounts for around 65% of group revenues, and probably more than go% of profits, according to Paul Heaton of Deutsche Bank. Some of the newer lines of business, such as life insurance, look promising. Others, such as stockbroking, have gone nowhere. In 1986, Mr Miyauchi bought Akane Securities, a tiny stockbroker with two branches in Tokyo and Osaka. It still has two branches. 
That lack of daring may eventually cost the company dear. With Japanese finance in turmoil, other companies are making bolder bets. America's GE Capital is one example. It is buying leasing assets, distressed debt and has also shown an interest in LongTerm Credit Bank. Mr Miyauchi could make money for Orix if he were ready to buy the bank, break it up and sell bits of it on. But as it is, Orix is hesitating and risks being trampled underfoot.Japan's financial deregulation will happen only once: a firm that is too timid will miss some of the best prizes. 
Mr Miyauchi's views on wider reform prompt similar criticism. When he joined the deregulation committee ten years ago, he says, he thought it a waste of time, with Japan's famously powerful bureaucracy too entrenched for much to change. Now, he seems satisfied with the speed of reform. The pace of boardroom change pleases Mr Miyauchi, too. Sony, a consumer-electronics company, began the trend in 1997, by cutting its board by half. Since then, around 200 companies have begun reform: about half have sincere intentions, thinks Mr Miyauchi. Although Japan is not running towards its future, he says, it is at least walking there. 
Surprisingly, Japan's economy grew in the first quarter of this year, at least temporarily interrupting the deepest recession since the war. But its big companies continue to suffer. Huge amounts of surplus labour and spare capacity threaten to entrench deflation. Despite its efforts to deregulate, the government cannot seem to relinquish its role in the economy. Public debts are vast and growing vaster each year. All of this, surely, calls for something a bit more urgent than the stately walk that Japan has adopted so far. As for Mr Miyauchi, he should go at full tilt. ","Yoshihiko Miyauchi is in the vanguard of corporate reform in Japan . But is he moving fast enough ?

She had some problem with her bicycle, she says. She does not look like the scourge of Osaka's bureaucrats, but they know otherwise.

Stories of officials' fictitious expense claims and illegal overtime payments to staff have brought shame and a touch of humility to the local authority. At Mihariban's annual meeting this month, Mrs Matsuura declared a victory, of sorts. After a seven-year battle, the local authority had agreed to make a settlement out of court, and Osaka's taxpayers will get some money back. 
Traditional deference to authority in Japan has encouraged officials to believe that they alone can decide what is in the public interest. But their grip is being weakened, partly because of people like Mrs Matsuura and the flowering of Japan's civic movement. 
The movement has its origins in what a newspaper columnist, Shin'ichi Yoshida, calls a ""crisis in the legitimacy of government"". Recession is weakening the claim that the bureaucracy is the best guarantor of economic growth. Scandal has also played a part. Tokyo's public prosecutors have made well-publicised raids on govemment ministries, as a result of which some officials have been forced to resign. 
Then there is the 5,ooo-member ombudsman movement. A Tokyo lawyer in the movement, Toshiaki Takahashi, noted that a number of local authorities in Japan were beginning to allow some ventilation of official activities. Mr Takahashi and his colleagues delved though records of expenses for entertaining, business trips and ""study tours"". National newspapers happily printed their reports, one of which told of a meeting at which officials had spent $500 per person discussing how to repair their city's finances. 
There are growing calls for referendums on matters of public interest. In August I996, a referendum was held in Maki, in Niigata prefecture, about a nuclear power plant. Since then referendums have been held, or are being sought, on such varied topics as waste disposal methods, publicworks projects and American military bases. Each seeks to challenge the notion that only the country's officials know what is best for Japan. 
The earthquake that hit Kobe in 1995 demonstrated in a practical way the shortcomings of officialdom. More than 1.3m ordinary citizens flocked to the city to help after it became clear that the official response to the chaos was inadequate. Since then, civic-minded groups have sprung up to provide care for the elderly and support for immigrant workers, two tasks neglected by officials. 
Not surprisingly, some bureaucrats have reacted with hostility to this awkward turn of events. But not all. Referendums have prompted public hearings on controversial decisions, a procedure that the construction ministry this week made mandatory for land-reclamation projects, which may have an effect on the wider environment. The entwined interests of bureaucrats and politicians have begun to unravel.

But his boots were muddied earlier this year when he agreed to accept a proposal to cut the number of seats in the 500-member lower house of the Diet (parliament) by 50 as the price for getting Ichiro Ozawa's Liberal Party to join his ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) in a coalition. 
This coalition, formed in January, has worked well, and has contributed mightily to Mr Obuchi's personal success. But the LDP has not yet carried out its promise to Mr Ozawa to get rid of the 50 seats, and is hesitating over whether to do so. If it does not, he is threatening to leave the coalition. 
If Mr Obuchi proceeds with the bill that would cull the seats, then the opposition party he really wants in the coalition, the larger and richer New Komeito, will shun his advances. On the other hand, an ultimatum by Mr Ozawa would bring Japan's coalition government into question. Mr Obuchi's rivals within the LDP would see an opportunity to undermine him just when he would be seeking re-election as party leader. 
Though Mr Obuchi's party has a handy majority in the lower house, the LDP is an embarrassing 22 seats short in the upper chamber. The Buddhist-backed New Komeito's 24 upper-house seats would give Mr Obuchi the majority he needs. The New Komeito's backer, the Soka Gakkai, a religious group with some 8m members, was attacked in 1995 by the LDP, and forgiveness has been slow. But the New Komeito has been alarmed that the 50 seats that Mr Ozawa wants to get rid of would be from the 200 in the lower house that are allocated by proportional representation. Critics of these PR seats say their allocation is open to abuse. 
The New Komeito, which received 32 of its current 52 lower-house seats thanks to the PR distribution, fears it would be badly hit. Consequently, the party has been cosying up to the LDP for months, helping it steer tricky legislation through the upper house and dropping hints about joining the coalition. In July, the New Komeito agreed to do just that, provided, of course, the LDP dumped its junior partner's plan to cut 50 lower-house seats. 
Will Mr Ozawa really leave the coalition as a consequence? The Liberal Party's single member in the cabinet, the home-affairs minister,Takeshi Noda, may well resign in protest. But Mr Ozawa's decision to pull out of the coalition is likely to be left as an ultimatum on the table while the LDP decides what precisely to do with the electoralreform bill. And that does not need to be until the Diet reconvenes in January. 
What the Liberal Party really wants from the LDP is help in getting its members reelected at the next general election. As part of the deal to join the coalition, the LDP offered to co-operate with the Liberal Party in selecting candidates, giving preference to incumbents from both parties. But Mr Obuchi's party is now saying that, if it has to sacrifice some of its own single-seat incumbents to make room for Liberal candidates, it will have to find seats for those displaced on the proportional-representation list. And that will be impossible if the list is cut by 50. So, sorry, no deal. That is why Mr Ozawa is in a huff this week, and why, ultimately, he will have to cave in on electoral reform and grudgingly make room for the New Komeito as well.

But Mr Ozawa 's decision to pull out of the coalition is likely to be left as an ultimatum on the table while the LDP decides what precisely to do with the electoralreform bill .

 What the Liberal Party really wants from the LDP is help in getting its members reelected at the next general election . As part of the deal to join the coalition , the LDP offered to co - operate with the Liberal Party in selecting candidates , giving preference to incumbents from both parties . But Keizo Obuchi's party is now saying that , if it has to sacrifice some of its own single - seat incumbents to make room for Liberal candidates , it will have to find seats for those displaced on the proportional - representation list . And that will be impossible if the list is cut by 50 . So , sorry , no deal . That is why Mr Ozawa is in a huff this week , and why , ultimately , he will have to cave in on electoral reform and grudgingly make room for the New Komeito as well .",740,Japan,A29-8200,IN TERM,True,"Keizo Obuchi , Japan 's unexpectedly adept prime minister",17,True

Japanese manufacturers and retailers, heavily dependent upon computerised just-intime delivery systems, are beginning to fear the worst.

Hospitals across Japan have started training staff on how to use manually operated equipment such as artificial respirators. 
Less than five months before computers confront the millennium bug, officialdom in Japan has suddenly realised that the country is horribly ill-prepared. The world's secondbiggest industrial economy comes below countries such as Hungary, Chile and Thailand in the ""preparedness index"" put out by Warburg Dillon Read, an investment bank, on the basis of research by Gartner Group, a consultancy. The government has flipped from confidence to panic. The prime minister, Keizo Obuchi, is chairing a crisis-management group, and officials are appealing to the public to take their own precautions. 
Since Japan computerised its banks, businesses, hospitals, schools and government offices much later than did America, more of the software in use in the country today is ""Year 200-compliant"" and can be expected to roll the millennium over correctly. Even so, recent studies suggest that a disturbing number of)apanese companies are woefully behind in their efforts to fix what faulty software they have. 
As elsewhere, the biggest laggards are small firms. In Fukushima in northern Japan, the prefectural government asked 15,000 local firms about progress.Only one in seven bothered to reply, and half of those thought they were immune to the bug. Of those that realised they were at risk, little more than a third had amended their software, a quarter were working on the problem, and the rest had yet to get round to it. 
But it is the lack of urgency among large firms and public services in Japan that has horrified the central government. Only a fifth ot the 2,000-or-so hospitals designated as crucial by the prefectural authorities have debugged the software for computerised medical equipment and records. 
Fewer than a tenth have put together contingency plans in case things go wrong. 
The Tokyo Stock Exchange (TSE) and the Japan Institute of Certified Public Accountants have been trying to bully Japanese companies into revealing what they have done to protect themselves against the millennium bug. For the first time, listed companies in japan had to report details of their Year 2000 remedial work in the shortform annual reports that they published in late May. Garry Evans of HSBC Securities in Tokyo has analysed disclosures by some 298 large firms listed on the TSE, and found that most had started late and provided only scanty details of their progress. Around 8% of the firms had completed their Year 2000 work when the reporting period ended in March; 46% said they expected to have done so by this month. 
Many of the companies did not start work until late last year. The most disturbing case was Nippon Steel, Japan's biggest steel maker, whose top managers had not heard of the Year 2000 problem until a year ago. And the most embarrassing was Nintendo, a videogame maker and one of Japan's highest-profile high-tech companies, which Mr Evans judges to be in danger. On the basis of their own reports, Mr Evans concludes that 30% of the companies examined are behind in their efforts to purge the millennium bug from their computers. 
If the rest of corporate Japan is no better, what might this do to the country's struggling economy? It should provide a boost in the fourth quarter, says Mr Evans, as firms stock components before the end of the year.

THE nine members of the Bank of Japan's policy board can be a stubborn bunch. On September 21st they refused to bow to behind-the-scenes pressure to relax the Bank's monetary policy. Such an easing was seen as a prerequisite to joint intervention by the Japanese and American authorities to curb the rise in the yen against the dollar. But the board, headed by the Bank's governor, Masaru Hayami, voted not to inject more liquidity into the banking system. Instead it decided simply to maintain its seven-month-- old policy of steering overnight interest rates down to zero. 
The decision went down badly in the financial markets, which had expected the central bank to relax its grip on the money supply. The yen promptly surged from 1o7 to 04 to the dollar (see chart on next page), a 4o% rise since August 1998; and the Nikkei average of 25 selected shares plunged by 607 points to 17,326 on September 22nd-the largest fall it has suffered this year. 
The markets should not have been surprised. The Bank had refused to ease the money supply seven months ago, and that was when the economy had only just bottomed out. As Richard Jerram of INc Barings, a Dutch bank, says, ""It was never realistic to expect a dramatic move now a clear recovery is under way."" 
In April last year, the Bank was given formal independence in the setting of monetary policy. But in recent weeks the finance ministry-aided by the prime minister, Keizo Obuchi-had tried to strong-arm it into a change of policy. At present, the Bank ""sterilises"" its foreign-currency intervention by mopping up the yen it issues to buy dollars through sales of its holdings of government bonds and other securities. Now the Bank is being urged to undertake ""unsterilised"" intervention-in effect, to print money by dumping the yen in the market. This week, the IMF made the same suggestion. 
Following the latest policy-board meeting, the Bank of Japan took the rare step of convening a press conference to explain itself, with a prepared paper. It stressed that it was already supplying enough money to the market by maintaining a daily level of surplus funds at i trillion. It pointed out that much of the liquidity injected each day ends up overnight in accounts held at the Bank by non-bank short-term money brokers called tanshi whose job is to mediate between lenders and borrowers. The amounts in these accounts have lately been increasing-- to around 75% of the daily injection. This is ""sufficient evidence"", says Kazuo Ueda, a policy-board member, ""that the banks do not need any more liquidity."" 
Nevertheless, many observers think the Bank has blundered badly in so boldly asserting its own independence. Certainly Mr Hayami's job is now on the line. And the Bank will take much of the blame if the rising yen now chokes off the Japanese economy's fragile recovery. The more charitable view is that the Bank does not think the time has yet arrived for it to make a u-turn, and that it might delay easing its policy for a month or so while it demonstrates to the world that it is not going to be shoved around by a bunch of panicky politicians. The trouble is that, by then, the yen could have climbed to Yen 80 to the dollar-and Mr Hayami could be looking for a new job. ","TOKYO

ON THE day Japan experienced the world's worst nuclear accident since the Chemobyl disaster in Ukraine, the prime minister, Keizo Obuchi, was engaged in planning a cabinet shuffle. He was busy constantly on the telephone discussing his new team with party heavyweights and having last-minute negotiations with his coalition partners over the legislative programme for the coming parliamentary session. 
It was not until mid-afternoon on September 3oth, some five hours after the explosion in Tokaimura, known as japan's atom city, that the head of the country's Nuclear Safety Commission, Kaoru Mamiya, told the chief cabinet secretary, Hiromu Nonaka, that he suspected that the radiation leak posed a health hazard to residents in the area. At six that evening an ""anti-disaster headquarters and liaison office"" was set up in the prime minister's official residence. But the anti-disaster team, chaired by Mr Obuchi, did not hold its first meeting until nine o'clock, more than ten hours after the Tokaimura plant had gone critical. 
The experts briefing the prime minister's team infuriated everyone by merely insisting that the accident should never have happened. The rules in force at the plant made criticality impossible, they insisted. But the plant continued to disobey the rules. The chain reaction, instead of dying down, got a second wind. Mr Obuchi feared he would be tom to pieces by the opposition as well as the press if he tried to manage such a crisis with a government in transition, and put off his cabinet shuffle. 
But what of his government's sluggish response to the disaster? Mr Obuchi seems to have had some luck, a virtue much coveted by all prime ministers. The fall-out could have been much worse had it not poured with rain in Tokaimura, a town of 33,ooo people. The rain diluted the contamination and prevented it from drifting as a cloud across the surrounding countryside. 
As it was, the radiation level outside the uraniumprocessing plant soared 4,ooo-fold. About 80 local residents fled their homes and a further 310,ooo in neighbouring communities were told to remain indoors until the allclear was given the following morning. Some 49 people were confirmed as having been exposed to the radiation that spewed out of the unshielded plant after three workers had accidentally tipped more than six times the required amount of uranium oxide into a processing tank-triggering a nuclear chain reaction that the plant's owners swore could never happen (see page 101). 
Mr Obuchi had some more luck with the eventual response of Japan's vast nuclear industry. Once it became clear that Tokaimura was in deep trouble, the electrical utilities rushed supplies of borate compounds from their nuclear power stations to Tokaimura to mop up the neutrons being emitted by the uranium oxide that had gone critical. Around six in the morning of October ist, the radioactivity surrounding the site began to drop, indicating that the chain reaction had at last been arrested. 
Nevertheless, the Japanese people are far from reassured that the nuclear industry, which provides about a third of their power, is in safe hands. They believe that, despite its passion for rules and regulations, Japanese officialdom is woefully inadequate at providing emergency measures and acting expeditiously when things go seriously awry. There have been several accidents at nuclear plants in the past few years (see map) none of them as serious as that at Tokaimura, but worrying just the same. Now it is claimed that the company which ran the stricken plant, JCO, a subsidiary of Sumitomo Metal Mining, one of the country's oldest companies, has broken the laws on nuclear safety for a decade to save money. 
Public pressure will doubtless mount for measures to rein in the country's nuclear industry. Mr Obuchi understands this. To save Japan's nuclear industry from the kind of dismemberment that happened in America after the Three Mile Island accident in 1979, he has decided to throw the book at JCO. A noisy show trial of the one company actually caught breaking the law may divert criticism from the suspect practices of others in the industry, and at the same time encourage them to mend their ways. On cue, JCO had its nuclear licence revoked on October 6th and police raided its offices, looking for evidence that it had behaved illegally. 
Meanwhile, the prime minister has ordered safety checks to be undertaken at all plants in Japan that handle nuclear fuel. After finding time to shuffle his cabinet on October 5th, the prime minister promptly instructed the relevant ministers to draft fresh legislation to cover nuclear disasters and to strengthen existing laws on safety standards for nuclear reactors and related plants. His main purpose is to give the central government the authority to issue evacuation orders and take prompt action when a nuclear emergency occurs, instead of having to sit around while an inadequately prepared prefectural governor's office fumbles, as apparently happened in Tokaimura. 
Parliament reopens in early November. Given the large majority the new coalition has in both houses, the necessary legislation could be passed by the end of the year. ","How Japan muddled through its latest nuclear accident

The fall - out could have been much worse had it not poured with rain in Tokaimura , a town of 33,ooo people . The rain diluted the contamination and prevented it from drifting as a cloud across the surrounding countryside . 
 As it was , the radiation level outside the uraniumprocessing plant soared 4,ooo - fold . About 80 local residents fled their homes and a further 310,ooo in neighbouring communities were told to remain indoors until the allclear was given the following morning . Some 49 people were confirmed as having been exposed to the radiation that spewed out of the unshielded plant after three workers had accidentally tipped more than six times the required amount of uranium oxide into a processing tank - triggering a nuclear chain reaction that the plant 's owners swore could never happen ( see page 101 ) . 
 Keizo Obuchi had some more luck with the eventual response of Japan 's vast nuclear industry . Once it became clear that Tokaimura was in deep trouble , the electrical utilities rushed supplies of borate compounds from their nuclear power stations to Tokaimura to mop up the neutrons being emitted by the uranium oxide that had gone critical . Around six in the morning of October ist , the radioactivity surrounding the site began to drop , indicating that the chain reaction had at last been arrested . 
 Nevertheless , the Japanese people are far from reassured that the nuclear industry , which provides about a third of their power , is in safe hands . They believe that , despite its passion for rules and regulations , Japanese officialdom is woefully inadequate at providing emergency measures and acting expeditiously when things go seriously awry . There have been several accidents at nuclear plants in the past few years ( see map ) none of them as serious as that at Tokaimura , but worrying just the same . Now it is claimed that the company which ran the stricken plant , JCO , a subsidiary of Sumitomo Metal Mining , one of the country 's oldest companies , has broken the laws on nuclear safety for a decade to save money . 
 Public pressure will doubtless mount for measures to rein in the country 's nuclear industry . Keizo Obuchi understands this . To save Japan 's nuclear industry from the kind of dismemberment that happened in America after the Three Mile Island accident in 1979 , Keizo Obuchi has decided to throw the book at JCO . A noisy show trial of the one company actually caught breaking the law may divert criticism from the suspect practices of others in the industry , and at the same time encourage them to mend their ways . On cue , JCO had its nuclear licence revoked on October 6th and police raided its offices , looking for evidence that it had behaved illegally . 
 Meanwhile , Keizo Obuchi has ordered safety checks to be undertaken at all plants in Japan that handle nuclear fuel . After finding time to shuffle Keizo Obuchi's cabinet on October 5th , Keizo Obuchi promptly instructed the relevant ministers to draft fresh legislation to cover nuclear disasters and to strengthen existing laws on safety standards for nuclear reactors and related plants . Keizo Obuchi's main purpose is to give the central government the authority to issue evacuation orders and take prompt action when a nuclear emergency occurs , instead of having to sit around while an inadequately prepared prefectural governor 's office fumbles , as apparently happened in Tokaimura . 
 Parliament reopens in early November . Given the large majority the new coalition has in both houses , the necessary legislation could be passed by the end of the year .",740,Japan,A29-8200,IN TERM,True,"the prime minister , Keizo Obuchi",20,True

The friendly German waiter pointed out that the paper bauble was made in Japan. For Mr Morita it was a disheartening experience: that the world associated ""made in Japan"" with trinkets and cheap imitations. For the rest of his working life he sought to prove to foreigners that ""made in Japan"" meant originality, quality and value for money. Keizo Obuchi, the Japanese prime minister, got it right when he said this week that Mr Morita was ""the engine that pulled the Japanese economy"". 
At heart, the man who made Sony a worldwide name was a tinkerer. He retained a childlike curiosity in pulling things apart to see how they worked. Even back in the 1930s his wealthy parents had many of the trappings of western life: a car plus all the electrical appliances of the day. The teenage Akio spent hours dismantling the family record-player and rebuilding it. His other passions were physics and mathematics. In the second world war, while serving in the Japanese navy, he met a fellow enthusiast for technology, Masaru Ibuka. In 1946, the two started a telecommunications company called Tokyo Tsushin Kogyo, with zo employees, the precursor of Sony. 
As things tumed out, Mr Ibuka looked after research and product development while Mr Morita went out to raise the money and sell the goods. Mr Morita's great early coup was to persuade America's giant Western Electric to license its transistor know-how to his tiny firm (a move that infuriated Japan's powerful trade ministry, which was by-passed). After his chastening experience in Dusseldorf, Mr Morita journeyed on to Eindhoven in the Netherlands where the great Dutch electrical group, Philips, had its headquarters. Here was a company in a small country that had created a global brand. ""If Philips can do it,"" he wrote home to Mr Ibuka, ""perhaps we can also manage."" 
A star is born 
Clearly, the tongue-twister, Tokyo Tsushin Kogyo, had to go. Mr Morita combined the Latin word for sound, sonus, with the English expression ""sonny-boy"" to give an impression of a company that was full of energy and youthful exuberance. Keeping things to essentials underlay many of Mr Morita's creative decisions. In the late 197os he asked the engineers at Sony to build a miniature stereo sound system. People could listen to music while exercising, he said. The Walkman has become synonymous with Sony, and immensely profitable. Sony charges a hefty premium for the creative content its brand name implies. 
There were disasters too. The Betamax video recorder was one. Though considered marginally better than the VHs recorder launched a year later in 1975 by the Japan Victor Company (both were based on an American design), the Sony version left little room for future improvement. Worse, Mr Morita upset manufacturers who wanted to make the Betamax recorder by driving too hard a bargain. The vHs design prospered and Mr Morita's Betamax lay dead in the water. A foray into Hollywood in 1989 also turned out to be an ill-judged, costly adventure. With that, the man who built up Sony as a global enterprise almost brought it to its knees. 
Mr Morita gave the impression of being a contradiction. Those close to him speak of the two sides to his personality. There was the strict Japanese traditionalist, the eldest son of a 300-yearold sake-brewing family in Nagoya who disinherited his own eldest son, Hideo Morita, for marrying without his consent. To the outside world he was a jovial, talkative and incandescent personality who illuminated a room and fired imaginations. It was an act Mr Morita worked hard to perfect. With his tanned skin from skiing and tennis, bluish eyes, rare among Japanese, and mane of white hair parted in the middle, he looked the dandy. Hideo Morita called his father a ""consummate performer"" whom no one outside the inner family ever saw unmasked. ""He had to act as the most international-understanding businessman in Japan,"" was how the son described him to John Nathan for his book, ""Sony: The Private Life"", published in September. Like Soichiro Honda and other entrepreneurs of his generation, Mr Morita embraced the outside world, America especially, because there was so little to be exploited in post-war Japan. The domestic market was sewn up by pre-war giants such as Toshiba, Hitachi, Mitsubishi and relative newcomers like Matsushita. But embracing the outside world did not mean that Mr Morita enjoyed it. 
He had to subjugate his traditional sense of decorum; he had to learn not only to speak English but also to think English; he had to learn to say yes or no when the weight of a dozen generations of family tradition pressed him to be ambivalent. On occasion, he misread foreign sensitivities. He tried to prevent the English translation of a book, ""A Japan That Can Say No"", of which he was coauthor with a right-wing politician, Shintaro Ishihara, and subsequently distanced himself from it. Mr Morita's lifelong campaign to embed Sony in the hearts and minds of foreigners seems to have been a painful struggle. He bore the pain well.

MITSUBISHI Motors is shedding 10,000 jobs and Nippon Telegraph and Telephone some 20,000 workers. After a summer lull, big Japanese firms are knuckling down to restructuring once more. With dole queues lengthening again, the thoughts of Keizo Obuchi, the prime minister, are turning to the jobs market. The parliamentary session which began on October 29th will be devoted to helping small companies and the venture capitalists that nourish them. Until now, policy has been unusually intelligent. That, alas, is about to change. 
Japan's small firms are losing both their youth and their vigour. Fewer young people are setting up their own businesses. In the years following the second world war, says the Ministry of International Trade and Industry (MITI), most company founders were under 40 years old. Now, most founders are over 40. The number of small firms is shrinking. Since 1991, more small firms have closed than opened, the opposite of what is happening in America. MITI officials blame Japan's backward venture-capital industry. The thrust of this autumn's legislation aims to improve matters. 
Until now, MITI has been leading by example. Last year, it hired foreign consultants to set up a new investment model for the industry. This is sorely needed. Japanese venture capitalists use a mechanical approach. They find their ""ventures"" by cold-calling from chamber-of-commerce lists. The idea is to invest small amounts of money in a large number of companies. Since investors require no seats on the board, they have little influence over managers. But that is not the idea: they are not in the business of supplying technical or financial advice. 
All of the large venture-capital firms are affiliated to big stockbrokers. They pick established companies so as to tie these in to underwriters before they list on Japan's over-the-counter (OTC) stockmarket. On flotation,the venture-capital subsidiary cashes in its equity and the stockbroker trousers the underwriting fee. Since the stockbroker is in the driving seat, more attention is paid to marketing than to the quality of the original investments. So Japan's growth companies are of middling quality and its venture capitalists hostage to the vicious boom-and-bust cycle of the OTC new-issues market. They are still recovering from the mid-1990s boomlet and their books are filled with ""living dead"": companies that failed to make it to market before the boom turned to bust. 
MITI has modelled itself on America's venture-capital industry. It invests only in equity and only in young companies, which it also hopes to encourage by introducing tax breaks for business angels. It invests using limited partnerships, a vehicle made possible by legislation passed last year. But it makes only token investments. So far MITI has spent only Y1 billion ($10m) of the Y10 billion it has procured from the finance ministry, mostly on information technology and e-commerce firms. It picks its companies with the help of a panel of private-sector experts, who also provide advice and management support to firms. 
Unfortunately, MITI is now getting bolder. Its analysis of Japan's shortage of startups is beguilingly simple. Despite the government's efforts, Japan still invests only about one-sixteenth of the money that America does in venture capital. So MITI wants to invest more itself. To do so, it has begun to warm up its old industrial policy. 
Ominously, MITI wants more money from the finance ministry for equity investing. It also wants to combine this with soft loans from government lenders. At the moment, government lenders demand physical collateral, such as property, when making loans. But MITI wants public money to be lent against business plans and other intellectual property. Moreover, although government lenders usually charge about 2% on their loans, policy loans qualify for a discount and MITI wants its chosen firms to get this discounted rate. 
As other countries have found, government subsidies are a poor way of encouraging venture businesses.But in Japan there is a particular danger that MITI's scheme could turn a temporary, macroeconomic policy measure into a enduring, microeconomic one. The temporary policy is an emergency measure introduced last year, under which the government increased by 20 trillion the loan guarantees for small firms handed out by Japan's regional credit-guarantee associations. outstanding loan guarantees are now near Y60 trillion, or 12% of total bank lending-and are set to grow by io trillion more. The government expanded the scheme by raising the amount of money small firms can borrow without pledging physical collateral-the exact method MITI now proposes for Japanese venture businesses. 
These soft loans already make the work of serious venture capitalists hard enough. Foreign firms looking for Japanese deals say government money keeps duff companies in business and deters good ones from taking their offers seriously. But then the real problems in Japan cannot be solved with a wad of cheap money. What small firms lack is opportunity, desire and willingness to take risks. That message, unfortunately, is not one that the politicians want to hear. ","TOKYO

IT HAD seemed such a good idea. To commemorate both the new millennium and the Group of Eight summit meeting in Okinawa next July, the prime minister, Keizo Obuchi, wanted to issue a Y2,000 ($19) note, the first new denomination in 42 years. And what a note. On its front would be a picture of the famous Shureimon gate of the Shurijo castle in Naha, the home of the former rulers of the Ryukyu kingdom before it was annexed by Japan in the 17th century and renamed Okinawa. On its back would be a scene from the classic novel, ""The Tale of Genji"", written by Murasaki Shikibu at the dawn of the millennium that will have just ended. Magnificent. 
Unfortunately, the public has been distinctly cool to the idea. In one opinion poll, two out of three respondents said they thought it a silly distraction and a waste of taxpayers' money. In a country that embraced the decimal system earlier and more enthusiastically than many western ones, anything containing a numeral like two just seems odd. The prime minister's office has spent the past month explaining that banknotes containing the numeral two are fairly common overseas. The Americans, for instance, are perfectly happy with their $20 bills and the British with their L20 notes. 
To no purpose, it seems. For a subcommittee of Mr Obuchi's own Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) now proposes to redenominate the whole Japanese currency anyway. By striking two noughts off all banknotes and coins, this would put the new yen on a par with the dollar and the euro. ""That would be good for internationalising and regaining trust in the yen,"" says the panel's Hideyuki Aizawa. 
There have been half-hearted attempts in the past to redenominate the yen. But this time something could actually happen. The LDP'S two coalition partners are enthusiastic. And given its big majority in both houses of the Diet (parliament), the coalition can now push through any legislation it chooses. A decision to redenominate could be made within months. 
Nationalism plays its part in the coalition's keenness. But so does the economy. Redenominating the currency would boost Japan's struggling GDP by a healthy 0.80, says Wako Research Institute. There are, for a start, all those new banknotes and coins to issue. Then there are hundreds of thousands of vending machines and ATmS to adjust, at a cost of around 50,000 old yen a go. And nearly as much work would have to be put into rewriting computer software as was required to save Japan from the millennium bug. By all accounts it would take two years to introduce the new yen. By then the Y2,000 banknote will have served its celebratory purpose. Perhaps people could then hang it on their walls? ","TOKYO

FINANCIAL engineering trails far behind the mechanical sort in Japan, but that is not for want of a good education. American business schools were once popular places to send promising young sararimen, and hundreds enrolled from big Japanese firms every year. Unfortunately, the idea was that they should devote more effort to keeping an eye on competitors than absorbing the West's peculiar way of doing things. And, as it turned out, the sararimen repaid their employers by joining foreign banks and consultancies. Understandably, the craze for foreign MBAs came to a prompt end. 
Now business schools are becoming popular once again-this time inside Japan, and for better reasons. Restructuring at big firms is shaking loose workers who thought they had jobs for life. Those that cling on are told they must specialise, in finance, marketing and so on. Small firms used to be looked down on. Suddenly, becoming an entrepreneur is in vogue. Foreigners used to fight over candidates whom Japanese firms had turned away. Now they have their pick of graduates-and they like nothing better than an MBA qualification. 
Japan had only a handful of business schools until recently, but this is creating new demand for business studies. Private universities such as Waseda and Nihon have started MBA courses. others, such as Aoyama Gakuin, plan to launch courses next year. Foreign universities are also entering the market. Canada's McGill, for example, will open a parttime MBA course in Tokyo next year. The education ministry, meanwhile, has been encouraging graduate studies at Japan's public universities, with the promise of funding for a new type of professional graduate school. The first of these new graduate business schools will open as soon as next year, at the prestigious Hitotsubashi University. 
Hirotaka Takeuchi, the dean of Hitotsubashi's new school, complains that the MBA courses taught in Japan tend to be dry and academic. His curriculum will be skewed towards practical education. More than half of Mr Takeuchi's staff have worked in private companies. The MBA course, which will be taught in English, will include project work with foreign and Japanese companies. A separate evening course on financial engineering is being pitched at Japanese bankers, who could do with a bit more Wall Street nous. Hitotsubashi will start small, with about 40 graduates. But it has big ambitions, hoping to turn itself into a pan-Asian centre for business studies and to lure those Asians who now go to America to study. Because it is a public university, says Mr Takeuchi, fees will be a fraction of those in America. 
Even Keizo Obuchi, the prime minister, has given the business schools his blessing. Mr Obuchi has been taking a keen interest in the mysteries of the MBA curriculum, suggesting in August that the creation of an MBA school at one of Japan's two top public universities (Tokyo and Kyoto) should become a manifesto pledge. 
In fact, Tokyo University (called Todai in Japan) has already been working on such a scheme. Unfortunately, there are factions in the senior common room that fear a grubby commercial course might cheapen their university's academic reputation. The MBA's supporters still plan to present the education ministry with a proposal for money from next year's budget. Without a consensus on campus, however, the education ministry may not oblige. Some old habits not even Mr Obuchi can change. ","Business studies in Japan

 Now business schools are becoming popular once again - this time inside Japan , and for better reasons . Restructuring at big firms is shaking loose workers who thought they had jobs for life . Those that cling on are told they must specialise , in finance , marketing and so on . Small firms used to be looked down on . Suddenly , becoming an entrepreneur is in vogue . Foreigners used to fight over candidates whom Japanese firms had turned away . Now they have their pick of graduates - and they like nothing better than an MBA qualification . 
 Japan had only a handful of business schools until recently , but this is creating new demand for business studies . Private universities such as Waseda and Nihon have started MBA courses . others , such as Aoyama Gakuin , plan to launch courses next year . Foreign universities are also entering the market . Canada 's McGill , for example , will open a parttime MBA course in Tokyo next year . The education ministry , meanwhile , has been encouraging graduate studies at Japan 's public universities , with the promise of funding for a new type of professional graduate school . The first of these new graduate business schools will open as soon as next year , at the prestigious Hitotsubashi University . 
 Hirotaka Takeuchi , the dean of Hitotsubashi 's new school , complains that the MBA courses taught in Japan tend to be dry and academic . His curriculum will be skewed towards practical education . More than half of Mr Takeuchi 's staff have worked in private companies . The MBA course , which will be taught in English , will include project work with foreign and Japanese companies . A separate evening course on financial engineering is being pitched at Japanese bankers , who could do with a bit more Wall Street nous . Hitotsubashi will start small , with about 40 graduates . But it has big ambitions , hoping to turn itself into a pan - Asian centre for business studies and to lure those Asians who now go to America to study . Because it is a public university , says Mr Takeuchi , fees will be a fraction of those in America . 
 Keizo Obuchi , has given the business schools Keizo Obuchi's blessing . Keizo Obuchi has been taking a keen interest in the mysteries of the MBA curriculum , suggesting in August that the creation of an MBA school at one of Japan 's two top public universities ( Tokyo and Kyoto ) should become a manifesto pledge . 
 In fact , Tokyo University ( called Todai in Japan ) has already been working on such a scheme . Unfortunately , there are factions in the senior common room that fear a grubby commercial course might cheapen their university 's academic reputation . The MBA 's supporters still plan to present the education ministry with a proposal for money from next year 's budget . Without a consensus on campus , however , the education ministry may not oblige .

WHEN Keizo Obuchi became prime minister of Japan in mid-1998, he was seen by his countrymen as quite the most improbable occupant of the top job in decades. He was dismissed as ""cold pizza""--a party hack. But the Japanese have a soft spot for ordinary folk who, thrust into demanding tasks, struggle to do their best. So they embraced the 62-year-old Mr Obuchi; he was no longer a cold pizza but their favourite uncle. And because he had no grand plans for reshaping Japanese society but was simply setting out to repair the economy, Mr Obuchi saw his approval ratings soar. They have now crashed. 
The latest poll suggests that support for Mr Obuchi's cabinet has plunged over the past month from 48% to 32%, while its disapproval rating has rocketed from 24% to 39%. Such a reversal in the mood of the people is almost unheard of in Japan. Coming as it does less than a year before the general election-which must be held before next October-the ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) is showing signs of panic. 
The reasons for the government's sudden unpopularity are not hard to discern. The Japanese people object to the LDP'S cynical bid to consolidate power through an alliance with one of its political enemies, the New Komeito, so it can exert unchallenged authority in the upper house of the Diet (parliament) as well as the lower house. it was bad enough when Mr Obuchi did a deal in January to form a coalition with Ichiro Ozawa's small right-wing Liberal Party. But at least the Liberals came out of the same mould as the LDP, having broken away in 1993. However, Mr Obuchi's deal in October with the New Komeito, an opposition party backed by a formidable lay-Buddhist organisation called Soka Gakkai, is far less acceptable. Although he has ensured a majority for the government in the upper house, it is at a price of public support. Apart from constitutional niceties about needing to keep government and religion separate, many Japanese are worried about letting the Soka Gakkai get its hands so close to the levers of power. Mr Obuchi is now feeling the effects of the public's understandable concern. 
He has upset the voters in other ways. Mr Obuchi's avuncular reputation was damaged in October when he punished Koichi Kato, the leader of the LDP'S second-largest faction, for daring to challenge his bid for a second tenn as party president, and thus prime minister. Mr Kato caused further offence by getting an unexpectedly large number of votes. By excluding Mr Kato's main followers from the new cabinet, Mr Obuchi got his revenge. But he also revealed a sense of mean-spiritedness that has dismayed the party faithful. 
The incident has served to remind people that, far from learning any lasting lessons from its fall from grace six years ago, the LDP is up to its old tricks again. only an arrogant disregard for the public's feelings could explain the prime minister's choice of Shingo Nishimura for the sensitive post of deputy minister of defence in parliament. Mr Nishimura, known for his loose tongue and even looser grip on reality, lasted only two weeks in the job before a public outcry forced him to resign over his remarks in Playboy about Japan needing its own nuclear weapons to prevent it from being raped. 
Then there is the question of political donations. According to a law passed in 1995 after the Recruit ""shares for votes"" scandal, corporate donations to individual politicians were to be banned within five yearsthat is, by January 1st 2000. To wean politicians off corporate handouts, the government has been financing Japan's political parties directly from taxation. But, with the deadline for an end to donations fast approaching, the LDP leadership, under pressure from its rank and file, decided it could ignore the public's previous outrage over influence-peddling and let the backhanders continue. The prime minister has now had to change his mind, declaring that the government will abide by the 1995 law after all. 
That, however, did not save Mr Obuchi from a roasting from Yukio Hatoyama, the leader of the opposition Democratic Party, during the Diet's first British-style question-- time on November 10th. The introduction of these weekly sessions, along with an end to the practice of allowing bureaucrats instead of ministers to answer tricky questions during Diet proceedings, was supposed to reveal the LDP as a modem political party capable of governing the country fairly and efficiently in the full gaze of the public. it has not worked out like that. Events so far have tended to show Mr Obuchi as a bumbling amateur, especially when grilled by consummate professionals such as Tetsuzo Fuwa, of the Communist Party. 
Mr Obuchi's woes do not end even there. The ruling coalition may be on the point of disintegrating. Mr Ozawa is threatening to pull his Liberal Party out of the alliance if the LDP fails to start serious discussions about merging the two parties before the present Diet session ends on December 15th. Mr Ozawa, one of the brightest stars in Japanese politics, is aware that, unless something is done quickly, his small party will be slaughtered in the coming general election. Mr Ozawa had hoped to get the LDP to co-operate in constituencies where his party has incumbents seeking re-election. The LDP promised to do just that when it was courting the Liberal Party last January. But it has changed its mind, saying it will have enough difficulty hanging on to its own seats. Hence Mr Ozawa's push for a full-blooded merger. 
But over half the LDP'S members are firmly against allowing the hectoring Mr Ozawa back. Besides, a reabsorption of the Liberal Party would make the LDP a far more conservative body. That might precipitate an exodus of Mr Kato and his more liberal-minded followers. Were that to happen, the LDP Could wind up smaller, rather than bigger, as a result of the merger with Mr Ozawa's people. 
As well as worrying about the waning support for Mr Obuchi, the LDP is now wondering whether to risk a split in its own ranks and welcome Mr Ozawa back, or reject his demand and go for an early election, possibly on January 12th. Whatever is decided, the prime minister's days are beginning to look numbered, as the party barons sharpen their swords ready for a slip-up at the polls.

CHATEAU MERCIAN may not have the cachet of a Saint Emilion grand cru, but Tadao Suzuki is proud of his wine. The president of Mercian Corporation, a Japanese drinks company, has even taken his best vintage to America. The Americans told him it might sell in restaurants for $50 a bottle. ""I took this as a compliment,"" says Mr Suzuki, ""but the truth is, in a Japanese supermarket it sells for $100."" 
Mr Suzuki's wine is expensive partly because it is made from Japanese grapes which, he explains, sell at five times the world price. A wine made wholly in Japan appeals to his richer customers. For the mass market, Mr Suzuki does the sensible thing and imports the grape juice, blending it with a little of the home-grown variety. His best-selling, wines which, to appeal to health-conscious Japanese, come with added polyphenols (to prevent heart disease) or blueberry juice (to sharpen eyesight), cost a more reasonable Y500 ($4.75). 
Not all Japanese businessmen are able to respond to high costs as flexibly as Mr Suzuki. Sake brewers must use Japanese rice, which sells at five or six times the world price. Transport is five times as expensive as in America. The average rent on a warehouse is ten times that in Britain. Steel, paper, cement, glass, construction, financial services, electricity, telecommunications, gas and land all cost far more in Japan than in Europe or America. 
These burdensome prices are the product of Japan's dual economy. Big exporters such as Sony, Honda and Matsushita make up one, competitive, tier of companies-the Japan that foreign firms come up against. The quality of its engineering and the efficiency of this Japan's mass-production techniques are still second to none. But these exporters cluster in just a handful of industries: cars and car parts, industrial machinery and consumer electronics. Much of the rest of the economy is grossly inefficient. According to the OECD, only three manufacturing sectors exceed or match the productivity of their American equivalents (see chart 1). Europe is also far behind America; what is different about Japan is that the laggards are so many, and so very far behind. 
The list of industries that are, in effect, welfare recipients is far too long. Government protection keeps too many workers in labour-intensive businesses that would otherwise have shrivelled with the rapid growth in wages in the 1960s. Japan's foodprocessing industry, for instance, is only one-third as productive as America's, and falling further behind. Yet food processing employs 2M Japanese workers, more than cars, car parts, steel and metalworking combined. Price fixing, bid-rigging and other sorts of anti-competitive behaviour lock too much capital and labour in smokestack industries, such as shipbuilding, chemicals and aluminium smelting, that should have shrunk long ago. 
The rot has spread to mass manufacturing, where Asian rivals such as South Korea and Malaysia are threatening Japanese industries such as semiconductors and consumer electronics. According to Richard Katz of the Oriental Economist, a newsletter, at least half of manufacturing output and onethird of factory workers are in troubled industries. 
Less of a good thing 
Meanwhile the competitive tier of the dual economy is shrinking. The Japanese car makers and consumer-electronics companies, which pioneered techniques such as just-in-time stock management, now find that everybody has adopted them, and that foreign rivals have introduced new methods of mass manufacturing. Some of the best Japanese firms are going abroad to get away from Japan's high costs. Matsushita, for example, has doubled its overseas workforce in the past eight years to 134,Ooo, but taken on only 6,000 new people in Japan, making the domestic total 148,000. Over the same period, Hitachi has also nearly doubled its number of overseas employees, but has reduced its workforce in Japan by 3% to 267,000. 
In Europe and America, service industries such as information technology and finance have become engines of growth as manufacturing has moved offshore. in Japan, they have been hobbled by restrictive regulations. Small, entrepreneurial companies have a hard time of it. Instead, capital and labour stay locked up in big companies, which try to diversify into new, ""growth"" industries, but rarely succeed. Nippon Steel came unstuck making laptop computers. Komatsu, which makes dumper trucks, and Minebea, a ball-bearings company, tried and failed in semiconductors. Some of the big consumer-electronics companies now say they want to get into providing nursing care. 
The system has seized up. Resources fail to flow to the most promising, fastest-growing, most productive bits of the economy. The Japanese call the disease kochoku, or rigidity. How to prevent it turning into shigo kochoku, or rigor mortis? 
Ichizo Ohara, a grandee of the ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) and economic adviser to the prime minister, Keizo Obuchi, claims to have the cure for this creeping disease. As agriculture minister three years ago, Mr Ohara took the flak for the deeply unpopular bail-out of Japan's jusen (mortgage lenders) which rescued many farmers-core LDP voters-who had put their savings into these dodgy home-loan companies. But now Mr Ohara is helping to mastermind Mr Obuchi's new reformist economic policy. On his wall hangs a photograph of Margaret Thatcher, whose leadership and radical reforming spirit were much admired in Japan. 
Mr Ohara talks of his country's supply-side revolution which, like its model in America and Britain in the 1980s, will expose sectors with low productivity to privatisation, deregulation, competition and restructuring. His impressive sweep encompasses the deregulation of health care, electricity and gas; the proper privatisation Of NTT, Japan's giant telecoms company; the removal of the remaining barriers to competition in finance; land reform; and a recasting of the tax system. 
Good fighting talk; the trouble is that the Japanese have heard it all before. When Ryutaro Hashimoto took office as prime minister in 1996, for instance, he promised to ""fight like a ball of fire"" for economic reform. Barely a year later, his flames had been doused by LDP reactionaries who forced him to abandon the privatisation of the post office. indeed, Japanese politicians have been making grand promises-even by the standards of their profession-and delivering little ever since the early ig8os. 
Take the price of electricity, which is by far the highest in the OECD. This has been bothering officials at the Ministry of International Trade and industry (MITI) for some time. In March 1998, a committee set up by the prime minister himself called for full deregulation and the break-up of Japan's ten local electricity monopolies. But in December that year the government decided to deregulate only the wholesale sector, which makes Up 28% of the market, and to keep the electricity companies intact. Another review is not due until 2003. An OECD report on deregulation* finds that this pattern repeats itself again and again in Japan. The liberalisation of air travel, transport, telecoms and land use have all been disappointingly slow and incomplete. 
One reason for the slow progress, says Heizo Takenaka of Keio University, is that the political economy is ""very well organised"". This means interest groups are locked tightly together, so that changing one part of the system means changing it all. For example, construction companies donate money to politicians, politicians get them work from the construction ministry, whose officials then take jobs in construction companies when they retire. These ""iron triangles"" of producer groups, politicians and bureaucrats obstruct reform across the economy and at all levels of government. 
Besides, deregulation alone is no longer enough. The government has mostly withdrawn from the protectionist industrial policies of the 1950s and 1960s, and from the anti-recession cartels of the 1970s and 1980s; but this earlier protection stifled competition among most Japanese companies, and even though the protection has now gone, the competition-has-still not returned. Even in the-most dynamic sectors, such as consumer electronics, few companies come or go. in the worst-affected industries, such as glass, construction, cement and steel, industry associations share out the market among a handful of big companies year after year. These cartels need to be broken apart, but the Fair Trade Commission (FTC), Japan's antitrust authority, lacks the muscle. its political base is weak, and key managerial positions are controlled by ministries. 
All this means, says NIT Takenaka, that the gradualist approach to economic reform gets nowhere in Japan. But no matter: gradualism has already given way to shock therapy.

A cross-bench political mission headed by a former Socialist prime minister,Tomiichi Murayama,which visited Pyongyang at the start of the month intencled merely to test the waters. it came back instead with an agreement from North Korea's ruling Workers' Party to restart talks on normalising diplomatic relations between the two countries. These have been frosty since the end of the second world war. 
Of Japan's two big diplomatic issues left over from 1945, normalising diplomatic relations with a missile-brandishing North Korea ranks higher these days even than settling the long-festering dispute with Russia over the return of four islands off Hokkaido that the Soviet army grabbed in the closing days of the war. Though Japan's 550,000 ethnic Koreans do not have a vote, pundits expect Keizo Obuchi's coalition government to win far more public support in next year's general election from getting the recalcitrant North Koreans to the table than it ever could from prising more territorial promises from the Russians. 
The ice between North Korea and Japan was broken by Kim Yong Sun, a senior party official, who spoke with uncharacteristic compassion about Japan's request for information on ten of its nationals who, it claims, had been abducted to North Korea many years ago. I sympathise"", said Mr Kim, ""with the pain that the [Japanese] families must be feeling after being concerned about the safety of their loved ones for so long."" The Japanese have never heard such words of commiseration from any North Korean official before. 
Intelligence reports since the 197os have suggested that the missing people were kidnapped by North Korean agents to act as language instructors in espionage camps. The Japanese authorities seethe quietly over the North Korean agents who roam around Japan, collecting hard currency as well as intelligence from sympathisers among the ethnic-Korean community. The abduction issue, which Japan has made a precondition to any discussions on easing tensions between the two countries, was a main reason for the collapse in 1992 of the previous normalisation talks. 
Apart from the sympathy handed round with the tea, Mr Kim also surprised his guests by saying that North Korea would appreciate a quick resumption of Japanese food aid. Though broke and hungry, North Korea has never asked the Japanese for food aid nor thanked them for it when it came. The North Korean regime has treated such aid instead as part of a standing demand for an apology and reparations from the Japanese government for the atrocities committed between 191o and 1945, when Korea was a Japanese colony. Mr Kim attached no preconditions to reopening talks, asking only that Japan should supply agricultural products until his poverty-stricken country became ""self-sufficient"" in food. 
Unfortunately, though this year's grain crop was up 5% over last year's, North Korea is now more dependent on foreign (mostly American, Chinese and South Korean) food aid than ever. Such aid this year provided more than 10%. of its total grain supply, almost twice as much as four years ago. 
An outraged Japan had cancelled its food aid, along with direct charter flights between the two countries, after North Korea fired a ballistic missile over Japanese territory in August 1998. At the same time, Japan suspended its financial contribution to the Korean Peninsula Energy Development Organisation. This outfit is part of the scheme hatched by America, South Korea and Japan five years ago to wean North Korea off producing plutonium, with which nuclear weapons can be made, by offering to replace its plutonium-rich nuclear reactor with a pair of less proliferation-prone westem-designed light-water reactors. 
Japan subsequently ended its ban on charter flights after America had persuaded North Korea to shelve its plans to test-fire another long-range missile. The Japanese government is expected to lift its remaining sanctions shortly. But first the Red Cross societies in the two countries have to arrange a meeting in Beijing to work out ways of dealing with the ""humanitarian issues"" raised during the Murayama mission last week; these are mainly home visits to Japan for the Japanese-born wives of North Koreans and the alleged abductions of Japanese nationals. only then will aid begin to flow. just what is needed from Japan to bring North Korea in from the cold?

But the UN has broad worries about Cambodia's ability to meet international standards of justice. its judicial system is said to be weak, corrupt and subject to political pressure. Safeguards are needed to ensure that the proceedings are beyond reproach, and that former Khmers Rouges now allied to the prime minister, Hun Sen, and his Cambodian People's Party are not immune from prosecution.

During this week's visit to Cambodia of the Japanese prime minister, Keizo Obuchi, Mr Hun Sen said Japan could appoint a judge. He also had a ""gift"" for Mr Obuchi to mark the breakthrough in the negotiations over the trial. it was that the UN could appoint a joint investigating judge.

ONCE again, Japan seems to be facing paralysis. Just as Keizo Obuchi, the prime minister, appeared to be rescuing the world's second-biggest economy from its worst post-war slump, everything seems to be going to the dogs. Mr Obuchi's popularity is sinking ever lower, the opposition benches in the Diet (parliament) are deserted because of a boycott, the fate of a crucial budget hangs in the balance and all the talk is of a snap election, possibly as early as April 16th or 23rd, in which Mr Obuchi's ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) could take a battering. To cap it all, if election politics prevents urgent issues from being dealt with, the fragile recovery could be in jeopardy. 
An election may be averted, but Mr Obuchi's coalition government is nevertheless preparing for one. The lower house's four-year term expires on October 19th, so a poll must be called before then. The prime minister has apparently pencilled in possible dates in late July and early September. August is out of the question because of holidays. Since late last year LDP members worried about winning re-election have been trying to ditch legislation that would make either their constituents or their corporate benefactors unhappy. As a result, reforms in retailing, banking, health care, pensions, telecoms and company taxes have already been watered down, reversed or suspended. 
A late-summer election would suit the prime minister best. The main reason is the economy. When he came to office 18 months ago, Mr Obuchi staked his reputation on achieving growth of at least 0.5% (later changed to 0.6%) in the 1999 financial year. There is little doubt he will succeed (see chart), thanks to his enormous publicspending measures, which in aggregate are worth V35 trillion ($325 billion). Since they pump money directly into the economy through schemes such as building projects, they should have an effect on growth. But Mr Obuchi will not be able to prove Japan is growing again until the GDP figures for fiscal 1999 are published in June. 
Apart from waiting until then to claim his glory, Mr Obuchi has another reason to hang on. Japan is playing host to the summit meeting of the G7 plus Russia in Okinawa in July. The prime minister intends to be in the chair. After scurrying around other East Asian countries offering to be the spokesman for the region, Mr Obuchi believes his opportunity to play the global statesman will go down well with voters. If he opted for an early election and fared badly, as well he might, either the voters or the LDP's backroom leadership could make him step down as prime minister. 
However, an early election might be unavoidable, especially if Mr Obuchi's coalition were to split. A split had appeared likely because of conflicting promises he had made to his two coalition partners, whose support he needs to retain his control over both houses of parliament. One of his partners is the Liberal Party. Mr obuchi has promised the Liberal leader, Ichiro Ozawa, that as a reward for his party throwing its lot in with the LDP the number of seats in the 5oo-strong lower house should be reduced by 50. The crucial part of the deal was that all 50 seats to be abolished would be among the 200 seats allocated by proportional representation (PR). 
Mr Ozawa, a radical conservative and former LDP rebel who hopes to return to the fold, probably as the ruling party's leader, wants to reduce the number of seats in the lower house in this way because he believes itwill help to create a two-party system in Japan much like America's or Britain's. Reducing the number of seats awarded by PR would reduce the chances of smaller parties seeing their candidates elected, thus forcing many of them to merge. 
The other party Mr Obuchi needs to woo if he is to keep his grip on power is the New Komeito, which he lured into his ruling alliance last October. The New Komeito, however, would be badly hurt by a reduction in the number Of PR seats; two-thirds of the party's members of the lower house owe their election to PR. So it wanted the plan scrapped. 
The result was a compromise: to trim only 20 seats. This satisfied the Liberals and New Komeito, but miffed the Democratic ","Paradoxically , Keizo Obuchi's could benefit from all Keizo Obuchi's troubles 
 ONCE again , Japan seems to be facing paralysis . Just as Keizo Obuchi appeared to be rescuing the world 's second - biggest economy from its worst post - war slump , everything seems to be going to the dogs . Keizo Obuchi's popularity is sinking ever lower , the opposition benches in the Diet ( parliament ) are deserted because of a boycott , the fate of a crucial budget hangs in the balance and all the talk is of a snap election , possibly as early as April 16th or 23rd , in which Keizo Obuchi's ruling Liberal Democratic Party ( LDP ) could take a battering . To cap it all , if election politics prevents urgent issues from being dealt with , the fragile recovery could be in jeopardy . 
 An election may be averted , but Keizo Obuchi's coalition government is nevertheless preparing for one . The lower house 's four - year term expires on October 19th , so a poll must be called before then . Keizo Obuchi has apparently pencilled in possible dates in late July and early September . August is out of the question because of holidays . Since late last year LDP members worried about winning re - election have been trying to ditch legislation that would make either their constituents or their corporate benefactors unhappy . As a result , reforms in retailing , banking , health care , pensions , telecoms and company taxes have already been watered down , reversed or suspended . 
 A late - summer election would suit Keizo Obuchi best . The main reason is the economy . When Keizo Obuchi came to office 18 months ago , Keizo Obuchi staked Keizo Obuchi's reputation on achieving growth of at least 0.5 % ( later changed to 0.6 % ) in the 1999 financial year . There is little doubt Keizo Obuchi will succeed ( see chart ) , thanks to Keizo Obuchi's enormous publicspending measures , which in aggregate are worth V35 trillion ( $ 325 billion ) . Since they pump money directly into the economy through schemes such as building projects , they should have an effect on growth . But Keizo Obuchi will not be able to prove Japan is growing again until the GDP figures for fiscal 1999 are published in June . 
 Apart from waiting until then to claim Keizo Obuchi's glory , Keizo Obuchi has another reason to hang on . Japan is playing host to the summit meeting of the G7 plus Russia in Okinawa in July . Keizo Obuchi intends to be in the chair . After scurrying around other East Asian countries offering to be the spokesman for the region , Keizo Obuchi believes Keizo Obuchi's opportunity to play the global statesman will go down well with voters . If Keizo Obuchi opted for an early election and fared badly , as well Keizo Obuchi might , either the voters or the LDP 's backroom leadership could make Keizo Obuchi step down as prime minister . 
 However , an early election might be unavoidable , especially if Keizo Obuchi's coalition were to split . A split had appeared likely because of conflicting promises Keizo Obuchi had made to Keizo Obuchi's two coalition partners , whose support Keizo Obuchi needs to retain Keizo Obuchi's control over both houses of parliament . One of Keizo Obuchi's partners is the Liberal Party . Keizo Obuchi has promised the Liberal leader , Ichiro Ozawa , that as a reward for his party throwing its lot in with the LDP the number of seats in the 5oo - strong lower house should be reduced by 50 . The crucial part of the deal was that all 50 seats to be abolished would be among the 200 seats allocated by proportional representation ( PR ) .

THE flight from Bangkok to Yangon, the capital of myanmar, takes only about an hour, but you need to turn your watch back because the local time is 30 minutes behind Bangkok. it might as well be 30 years. Once upon a time, when Bangkok was a quiet backwater, rich Thais would travel to Yangon to go shopping. in the late 1950s the city was one of the commercial capitals of Asia. That was when the World Bank reckoned that Burma, as the country was then called, was destined to become one of the most prosperous places in South-East Asia. But now its people are oppressed by a brutal military regime, the economy is a shambles, and only the black market, with its nasty whiff of drug-money, enables the country to get by. 
Myanmar has long been ruled by military govemments, the latest of which seized power in a coup in 1988. Every morning the regime's hysterical mouthpiece, the New Light of Myanmar, urges the nation of 45m to be on its guard against all manner of evils. A recent issue reporting a speech by Majorgeneral Kyi Aung, the minister for information, provides a fair sample: 
In their attempt to interfere in the internal affairs of small and developing nations by means of the media, big nations destabilise target nations, spreading rumours, concoctions, disinformation and false news, which aims at creating confusion and chaos and riots to topple the government concerned and install their favoured elements as government. 
Now they know. And no one in Myanmar is in any doubt who those ""favoured elements"" are: the opposition National League for Democracy (NLD), led by Yangon's best-known resident, Aung San Suu Kyi. in 1990, in an extraordinary demonstration of their remoteness from real life, the generals decided to hold an election, convinced that their popularity would ensure an easy victory for them. When Miss Suu Kyi, already under house arrest, led her party to an overwhelming victory, they refused to accept the result. Since then they have relentlessly harassed and persecuted Miss Suu Kyi and her supporters. They have kept the main universities closed for fear that students might cause trouble (although some courses are now re-opening). And they have brushed off international pressure for a dialogue with the NLD, and in particular with Miss Suu Kyi. 
The generals are drawing up a new constitution that seems likely to entrench the role of the armed forces in political life permanently. Their plan seems to be to call another election once the NLD has been sufficiently dismembered. This time, thanks to their new constitution, they think they will be able to get the result they want. That will allow them to claim the legitimacy to govern, which in turn will cause foreign aid and investment to resume. 
An outdated blueprint 
The big flaw in all this is that it is based on an out-ofdate version of the Indonesian model. in that country the armed forces long held power, with a big role in political life and a block of seats in parliament guaranteed by the constitution. Indonesia, too, held elections, and President Suharto and his ruling party always won. if Indonesia could do this, the thinking went, so could Myanmar. But when the economic crisis came, President Suharto was forced from office. Now the armed forces are coming under civilian control. After a reasonably clean election, a civilian president, in the shape of Abdurrahman Wahid, took over. When he was asked about Myanmar, he said: ""Personally, my sympathy goes to Suu Kyi."" 
When Mr Wahid visited Yangon, however, he was more Circumspect. He stayed away from miss Suu Kyi, even though he had said earlier that he would visit her. Even so, the message remained clear: with Indonesia now on the road to democracy, a substantial part of South-East Asia was hoping Myanmar would mend its ways. When five student exiles from Myanmar took over their country's embassy in Bangkok last October, Thailand agreed to fly them to the border with a rebel-held area of Myanmar in return for the release of their hostages. Explaining the action, a Thai minister called the gunmen ""student activists"" fighting for democracy, rather than terrorists. Most Thais applauded. Myanmar grumbled and temporarily closed its long land border with Thailand. But the incident invited more trouble: some of the students were among ten members of a more radical group who took over a Thai provincial hospital in January. All of them were killed when Thai commandos rescued their 700 hostages. 
For now, Myanmar remains in a stalemate. Both the generals and Miss Suu Kyi are as stubborn as one another. They have all the guns, but she has the moral high ground. That presents its own problems. Miss Suu Kyi is an icon of democratic struggle who has won a Nobel peace prize and commands international support. She is not the sort of person whom western governments can easily chivvy into reaching an accommodation with a military regime she detests. There is no reason why she should budge. 
All the same, there is now a glimmer of hope. A confidential World Bank report, based on a study of Myanmar's economy and delivered to Yangon late last year, gave warning that the country was caught in a sharp downward spiral and that urgent reforms were needed. Myanmar seemed prepared at least to discuss the report, even though it also urged political change. Earlier the UN and the World Bank had offered $1 billion in development aid if the government were to begin talks with the opposition. 
Usefully, the pressure on Myanmar is now coming from the East as well as the West. Following a meeting between the Japanese prime minister, Keizo Obuchi, and the chairman of Myanmar's ruling council of generals, General Than Shwe, on the sidelines Of the ASEAN summit last November, Japan indicated that it might resume some aid if there were signs that Myanmar was ready to undertake political and economic reform. Myanmar welcomed the Japanese initiative, but tried to make it look as though Japan was breaking ranks with the West. Yet the Japanese said much the same as the World Bank, albeit delivered in a more polite tone. ""It's a bit like throwing a hard ball and then a soft ball,"" said a spokesman for Mr Obuchi. ""What is important is that they get the message."" 
If the generals do not get the message, then Myanmar may remain a decaying pariah state, with a rich elite plundering a grindingly poor country. Discontent will fester and spread, perhaps even among some in the armed forces-which, although the biggest item in the government's budget, are already facing cutbacks. The generals may be aware of that. if they are not, change in Myanmar, when it comes, could be bloody. 
Along with Myanmar, Vietnam, Cambodia and Laos are the newest members Of ASEAN. The three countries along the Mekong have already shed a river of blood in the many conflicts that have raged through their lands, and although peace has now returned, the past continues to haunt them. Some 2M Cambodians-about a fifth of the population-- were killed or starved to death by the Khmers Rouges between 1975 and 1979, when collectivist terror reigned. 
After suffering incursions on its own border, Vietnam invaded Cambodia in 1978 and installed a government made up mainly of defectors from the Khmers Rouges. But it was not until the 199os, after Vietnam had withdrawn its troops, that Cambodia seemed to return to some semblance of normality. The Khmers Rouges mostly disappeared into the jungle, where their dreaded leader, Pol Pot, died (or was assassinated, according to some) in 1998. After a UN-sponsored election in 1993, a coalition government was formed. in July 1997, the leader of one of the coalition partners, Hun Sen, a former Khmer Rouge commander, led a coup against his co-prime minister, Prince Norodom Ranariddh. Following a peace deal and a second UN-backed election, the prince is back as a member of Mr Hun Sen's new coalition government. Whether this alliance can last is another question, but at least both sides know that the stability conferred by accountable government is essential to improving business confidence, keeping aid flowing and boosting the economy. 
By comparison, poor landlocked Laos seems almost sleepy. Although it seemed to be largely forgotten by the Asian boom, it was hit by the regional downturn and continued to suffer last year, with its currency rapidly depreciating. Economic reform appears to be continuing, but political reform, in a oneparty state basically run by generals and communists, seems more uncertain. Some say that despite a security clampdown in the capital, Vientiane, there have been anti-government protests. According to diplomats, a number of Christians and democratic activists have been jailed. 
Uncle Ho's legacy 
Among the countries along the Mekong river, it was Vietnam where ambitions were highest. Yet Ho Chi Minh, the father of the nation, still lies in his vast mausoleum in Hanoi, and his Vietnamese Communist Party is still running the country. Some of the hardliners in the party think the region's financial crisis justifies everything they have not done. 
""Come back in five years,"" says Ai Quoc (not his real name, because giving it would get him into trouble). ""The old men running the country will be gone, we will no longer need to disguise our company from the attention of the state, and we might list it when there's a stockmarket."" Like many young Vietnamese, Ai Quoc is remarkably entrepreneurial. Unfortunately most of his energy has to go into ducking and diving around the system, fending off bureaucrats in Ho Chi Minh City and hustling permits in Hanoi. if only the government would get out of the way of people like Ai Quoc, Vietnam might have turned into the economic tiger which not so long ago many people believed it was destined to become. 
Instead, Vietnam is either a country of lost opportunity or a lucky escapee from the forces of globalisation. it depends who you are. Those who take the bleak view see economic reforms slowed down to a crawl or stalled altogether. Many foreign investors who rushed to set up shop in Vietnam during the Asian boom have gone home or are now out of pocket. Some had their hopes pinned to a big trade deal with the United States that was meant to give Vietnam normal trading relations with America, to round off the restoration of diplomatic ties in 1995. it would have required America to reduce its high import tariffs to give Vietnamese exporters a clear shot at the world's richest market. By one estimate, in the first year alone, it would have doubled Vietnam's exports to America to $1 billion. But just when everything was ready to be signed last July, Vietnam's leaders suddenly got cold feet. 
The doubters, it appears, were mainly members of the powerful politburo-and in Vietnam the party still has the upper hand. The party bosses were worried about what Vietnam would have to offer America in return, such as opening up its own market to American companies and aligning the country's rules and regulations more closely with those of the World Trade Organisation. Alarm bells rang. Some thought that opening up too quickly could land the country in much the same sort of trouble that had recently befallen the capitalists in South-East Asia. Vietnam had seemed to escape the crisis, with its economy still growing by 5% last year, simply by not rushing ahead with the reforms the West had been calling for. 
It was another sign of Vietnam's leadership looking increasingly inwards. A campaign to root out corruption was already in full swing, and a number of senior heads had rolled. The leadership was so preoccupied with clearing out putative bad apples that it had little interest in other issues. An anti-corruption drive in itself is no bad thing, but there are fears that it could make the more liberal members of the government even less willing to speak out in future. 
""Things will probably have to get a lot worse before anything much happens,"" says a western diplomat in Hanoi. ""Then they will wake up, worry and do something. Perhaps we might see a doi moi two."" Doi moi was the policy of ""economic renovation"" launched over a decade ago. It raised hopes that Vietnam, with almost 8om mostly young and largely literate people, had the potential to become a big new market. That did not happen. An annual growth rate Of 5%, although not to be sniffed at, is only modest in South-East Asian terms, especially as Vietnam needs to grow rapidly to provide jobs for all the young people who will be entering the workforce, as well as those who will have to be laid off by floundering state-owned industries. With other parts of South-East Asia recovering strongly, Vietnam risks becoming even less attractive to foreign investors than it is now. Growth could slow further and provoke the very crisis its leaders thought they had managed to duck. 
What that might mean politically is hard to forecast. A number of senior Vietnamese leaders are due to retire over the next five years, which would leave room for a younger and more reform-minded generation to move up. They might be prepared to take bold measures. But as ever with a communist system, much will depend on how secure the party feels. At present its grip on power is still strong. Although there have been some uprisings, particular in Thai Binh province, these were mostly against local corruption rather than against the party itself. 
Apart from the party, the only other organised movement in Vietnam is religion. Buddhist monks have often led protests in the past. Some 8-10% of the population are Roman Catholics. Sometimes religious groups are tolerated or benefit from the authorities' benign neglect, but there have also been times when they were seen as a rival centre of power and cracked down upon, just as the Falun Gong sect has been hounded in China. 
The shadow cast by China looms large. For Vietnam, China is a far older enemy than the colonial French or Americans, in 1975, the evacuation of the last Americans from the roof of the American embassy in Saigon (later renamed Ho Chi Minh City) brought to an end more than a decade of military involvement in Vietnam by the United States. Yet the battles with China go back over 2,000 years. The most recent was in 1979, when Chinese forces briefly invaded their neighbour. However, Vietnam is worried not only about the military threat from China, but about its economic fall-out as well. The way the communist government in Beijing manages China's evolution to a market economy is likely to make a big difference to the way Vietnam conducts its own transition. Nor does this go only for Vietnam. China's growing economic and political clout increasingly shapes the whole region. ","Myanmar and Indochina remain the laggards

ASKED about the prospects for a common East kAsian currency, Rodolfo Severino, the secretary-general of the Association of South-East Asian Nations (ASEAN), looks around the room for the youngest person present. ""Perhaps in her lifetime,"" he says. A giant trading block that comprises SouthEast Asia, Japan, China and South Korea may be 30 years off, but it seems to be on its way. it would bring together one-third of the world's population with a combined GDP of almost $7 trillion at present. That would make it a considerable counterweight to the world's two existing economic powerhouses, the United States and the European Union. In time it might outweigh them. 
With so many historical animosities to overcome, progress will be slow. But as Edgardo Espiritu, until last month the Philippines' finance minister, points out, it took divided Europe many decades to move towards a common currency. ""Perhaps it will also take us that time."" Paradoxically, the economic crisis may have given the region a push towards greater unity. ""The East Asian financial crisis should bring the East Asian nations closer together,"" says Daim Zainuddin, Malaysia's finance minister. Even countries that once saw themselves as somewhat apart from the rest have become more clubby. Kim Dae Jung, South Korea's president and its most democratic leader to date, now talks of the ""mutual interests and concerns"" that his country has discovered with others in the region. 
The strongest evidence of this new enthusiasm for unity is that East Asia's leaders are planning to get together more often. When the ten members of ASEAN met in Manila last November, they were joined not only by Mr Kim but also by Zhu Rongji, China's prime minister, and Keizo Obuchi, Japan's prime minister. All of them agreed that meetings of this group, awkwardly named ""ASEAN-plus-three"", would become a regular event. 
South-East Asia's three powerful neighbours have a strong commercial reason for looking south: they know that a bigger pie will be good for everybody. At the Manila meeting, the ASEAN members agreed to speed up the elimination of tariffs as part of their plan to form a free-trade area among themselves. The entry of China into the World Trade Organisation will make that country's economy more competitive and more open to investment from the region, not least from the many overseas Chinese. Japan and South Korea, which are among the biggest foreign investors in South-Fast Asia, will benefit from a single ASEAN market which their factories in the region can supply. 
But not everything about such a single market is straightforward. Take the question of a financial liferaft. During the crisis Japan launched a temporary $3o billion fund to help Asian countries overcome their problems. The South-East Asians would like Japan to turn this into a permanent facility, a sort of lender of last resort should anyone get into trouble again. Although Japanese officials deny it, such a fund sounds remarkably like the ""Asian Monetary Fund"" that Japan and Malaysia proposed during the worst of the region's troubles, only to have the idea quickly shot down by America. The fear then was that any bail-out fund led by Asia would not impose sufficiently tough conditions to ensure that the recipients of the money would carry out the necessary restructuring. indeed, Japan's own sickly economy, caused by failure to reform its financial industry, bears witness to that. 
Even so, America seems to be less bothered by the scheme in its latest guise. But what does Japan get out of it? Easy: the more finance Japan provides in the region, the better it will be for its campaign to internationalise the yen, which seems to have lost ground against the dollar and the euro of late. And at the same time as doling out money at the Manila meeting, Japanese officials were trying to elicit pledges of support from ASEAN leaders for their candidate for the vacant post of managing director of the IMF, Eisuke Sakakibara, a former top financial official. 
The Japanese were pushing at open doors. The IMF had been the chief bogeyman during the financial crisis, mainly because it was seen to be too westem-influenced and uncaring. All the same, some South-East Asian countries swallowed its medicine and got better. one refused, but still got better. ""We have resorted to different ways to overcome our economic problems,"" says Malaysia's Mr Daim, referring to the imposition of selective capital controls against the advice of many financial commentators. ""The results have been positive. The speed and extent of our recovery is comparable to any other crisis-hit economy in the region.. But what makes our recovery outstanding is the fact that it was achieved without the painful social and political upheaval."" 
Really? Political life in Malaysia certainly seems to have its painful moments. As for the economy, it does look in better shape, and perhaps the capital controls really were a help. But if they have delayed corporate and financial restructuring, they may have been less helpful than they seemed. 
Looking at the region as a whole, it is too early to say who has done the best job of putting his house in order. When the crisis struck, different countries were at different economic stages and consequently suffered different degrees of damage. For instance, whereas Thailand is concerned mainly about the effect of its high level of non-performing loans on the financial sector, the Philippines' Jose Pardo, who took over from Mr Espiritu as finance minister last month, says his top priority is to curb a ballooning budget deficit. 
When South-East Asia's bounce-back starts to peter out, more problems may emerge. And although the renewed growth looks impressive in local-currency terms, it seems less wonderful when measured in dollars (for the effect on exports, see chart 6, previous page). ""The crisis really has not changed the sort of things we have to look at,"" says Bruce Gale, of Political & Economic Risk Consultancy in Singapore. As the recovery continues, he will be watching two main indicators: how well countries are carrying out their economic reconstruction, and how strong their national institutions are. At present, few countries in South-East Asia can claim good marks for both. 
The main political impetus behind a more united East Asia is the hope that it would provide greater security. The area contains some of the world's most dangerous flashpoints. A real war between nuclear-armed India and Pakistan over the disputed territory of Kashmir would greatly unsettle all of Asia. China has threatened to invade Taiwan should it ever declare independence from the motherland. And no one really knows what will happen to dangerously unstable North Korea. 
China has long been suspected of wanting to increase its political hegemony in the region. Meanwhile, America's direct influence may decline, although Japan could increasingly pick up that role through a new defence pact with the Americans. For South-East Asian countries that have been variously colonised, invaded or pushed around by China or Japan in the past, the prospect of either country extending its influence in the region is a highly sensitive issue. 
Trouble specks 
The Spratly islands are a case in point. China lays claim over all of the South China Sea (see map), which includes many of the world's busiest shipping lanes and is the main highway for Japan's trade. The Spratlys are no more than a collection of reefs, although the area may yet prove to be rich in oil and other minerals. But the islands are also claimed, in whole or in part, by Taiwan, the Philippines, Brunei, Malaysia and Vietnam. During the past year the Chinese have erected a building on one of the reefs which they claim is a shelter for fishermen, but which to all the world looks like a fort. This has increased tensions, and provoked several tussles with the Philippine navy. 
Now that all the countries involved are pals in ASEAN-plus-three, the Philippines has tried to broker a peace plan. Unhelpfully, the Philippine navy is so ill-equipped that it can hardly put to sea, let alone defend a territorial claim. The Chinese have noted, but not gone along with, the Philippines' idea for a code of conduct for countries with competing claims over the Spratlys. However, Chinese officials have been reported as saying that although they would not drop claims of sovereignty, they might consider joint development of the islands. That could mean one less flashpoint, but others could still pop up. That is why South-East Asia's leaders have decided to form a troika of (yet-to-be-named) ministers who would respond to regional emergencies. Joseph Estrada, the president of the Philippines, says the team will be ""more proactive"" in dealing with urgent problems. in the past, ASEAN has maintained a policy of ""non-interference"" in members' internal affairs. That policy has not been scrapped, but the new troika points that way. 
What triggered the latest move was the crisis in East Timor. The lack of a regional response to the killings and destruction unleashed when the East Timorese voted for independence from Indonesia left a vacuum which had to be filled by Australia and the West. Many East Timorese leaders are suspicious of their South-East Asian neighbours, viewing them as supporters of Indonesia's brutality against them, if only by omission. Many do not want an independent East Timor to join ASEAN. They see their country as a Pacific nation and consider Australia as one of their best friends. 
Yet some in South-East Asia saw the events in East Timor almost as an attempt by the West to recolonise part of the region. The UN transitional authority on the island is keen to dispel that impression: the military forces there will soon pass from the command of an Australian to a Filipino. if an ASEAN troika had been in place at the time, would it have moved swiftly enough to end the violence, even if backed by the UN? No one will know unless something like East Timor happens again. it might do, perhaps in the shape of Aceh in Indonesia breaking away, or of an uprising against the regime in Myanmar. Although many in South-East Asia would doubt it, western nations-with plenty of other trouble spots nearer home to worry about-would probably Welcome ASEAN trying to take care of problems in the region on its own. 
As for Asian values... 
if it does, the last thing on its mind will be ""Asian values""* When the tiger economies were going strong, those values were praised to the skies by leaders such as Malaysia's Dr Mahathir, though rather less is heard of them now. Thailand and the Philippines never really believed that there were some features of life in Asia, such as supportive families and greater levels of trust, that somehow set it apart from the West. Asian values are now widely seen as an invention to find common ground for countries with widely differing ethnic, religious and political backgrounds. ""The campaign for Asian values will come to be seen in the years ahead as a pragmatic interlude during which Asian leaders briefly sought to justify authoritarian rule before losing power to the middle class they themselves had helped to create by managing their economies for so long with such success,"" says Victor Mallet in his book ""The Trouble with Tigers"". 
But the issue has not disappeared. ""It now goes under another name: 'western interference',"" says Zaitun Kasim, a parliamentary candidate for a grassroots women's initiative in Malaysia. it still echoes in South-East Asian criticism-some of it legitimate-of the West's dominance of international organisations such as the IMF and the wTo. it is also heard when some of the regional leaders inveigh against the forces of globalisation. it is least credible when it takes the form of accusations that greater democratic ambitions, too, are a western-influenced evil. After all, the world's biggest democracy, India, is an Asian country. The world's third-biggest may well be emerging in the east too, in the battered and bloodied shape of Indonesia. Democratic values, just like Asian values, are universal. 
Different countries may have different ways of getting there. ""We want to develop home-grown democracies,"" says Charles Santiago, a Malaysian economist at Stamford College in Kuala Lumpur. Some things may be the same, he says: greater financial transparency, free media and the fight of assembly. Other things may be different: for example, many South-East Asians see the lobby system in the United States as a type Of KKN. ""The exact form of the political systems that evolve will be different,"" says Abhisit Vejjajiva, the young Thai minister. But ""greater democracy will happen all over the region. Even the new members Of ASEAN have seen it coming. To be part of the international community, at least economically, they will have to adapt."" 
There is a risk that the speed of the region's recovery may delay the necessary tasks of fixing broken financial systems, restructuring companies and reforming economics. But the financial crisis has helped with something that will make such reforms more likely to succeed: the move towards more plural, more democratic societies. The faster South-East Asia can get on with that, the better.

IT ALL started during Gerhard Schroder's visit to Japan last November. The Gen man chancellor mischievously mentioned to Keizo Obuchi, the Japanese prime minister, that it might be a nice idea to invite China to this year's summit meeting of leaders from the Group of Seven (G7) industrial countries plus Russia, which is to be held on theJapanese island of Okinawa in July. Why not, indeed, mused Mr Obuchi, worried about his dwindling popularity in the polls and the general election he must call before October. Getting Jiang Zemin, the Chinese president, to the summit table would be a diplomatic coup. And such a demonstration of Japanese statesmanship could go down well with the voters. 
But few at the top of Mr Obuchi's ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) thought the implications through before trumpeting the prime minister's intentions. Off went a high-level (but officially unofficial) delegation to Beijing, headed by Takenori Kanzaki, the boss of New Komeito, the only other party in Mr Obuchi's coalition that counts. Fortunately for Mr Obuchi, his envoy got no further than the Chinese vice-president, Hu Jintao. Aghast, Mr Hu declared his reservations about China attending the Okinawa summit, even as an observer. 
Had Mr Kanzaki got President jiang's ear instead, he would have finished up with a far more embarrassing rebuff. The Chinese have made it clear that since NATo bombed their embassy in Belgrade last year the only international outfit they will deal with is the United Nations. As for the G7 countries, their concern for democratic principles and the protection of human rights are anathema to China. 
The Americans, meanwhile, have been cagey. Aware that the Chinese have little to gain and possibly something to lose by attending the summit, the State Department has said it has no objections to China's participation at the meeting as an observer, but that Japan alone has to decide. 
In Tokyo, the government's spin-doctors have been trying to gloss over the prime minister's gaffe. The new line is that Mr Obuchi is only responding to calls from members of the Diet (parliament) to invite President Jiang to the Okinawa gathering. But probably more Diet members are against such an invitation than for it. To get Mr Obuchi off the hook, the Japanese foreign ministry has been trying to persuade at least the Chinese prime minister, Zhu Rongji, to visit Japan before the July summit rather than three months afterwards, as originally intended. So far, the Chinese have limited themselves in public to saying that an early visit ""will be difficult"". Mr Zhu has let itbe known that he intends to stick to his plan to visit Japan immediately before or after an AsiaEurope meeting due to be held in South Korea in October. 
Poor Mr Obuchi. He had hoped to play the part of the Voice of Asia at the coming summit, with well-wishers, including President Jiang, looking on. But China is only one of several Asian countries that are not all that keen to see Japan behave as if it were their representative. Mr Obuchi is now paying the price for trying to drag such delicate issues of diplomacy into crass election politics. All of which, pundits say, was predictable stuff. Mr Schroder, a relative newcomer to serious world politics, will have to curb his sense of mischief. ","TOKYO

Or is it beginning to boom, as the Internet takes hold and consumers start to spend again? The figures are more confusing than ever, but the underlying picture does appear to be getting a bit brighter 
IS THERE no end to the bad news about the japanese economy? This week's announcement that, after a brief recovery in the first half of 1999, the country had slipped back into recession in the second half, makes one wonder. The economy shrank by 1.4% in the fourth quarter of the year, a horrible 5.5% at an annual rate. And this came after a 1% contraction in the third quarter, fitting the technical definition of a recession as two quarters of negative growth (see chart 1). 
it is not just the GDP figures that look sickly. Banks, still burdened with bad debts, are continuing to shrink their loans, especially to small firms that employ four in five of the country's workers. And the long-overdue efforts of big businesses to restructure, meaning to rid themselves of surplus staff, pare debt and cut idle capacity, are also causing short-term pain. After a lull, bankruptcies are on the increase again: in February, the number of companies going bust rose by over 50% on a year earlier. Last month's threat by Moody's, a credit-rating agency, to lower Japan (still the world's biggest creditor country) a notch on its scale has merely put a finishing pall on this gloomy picture. 
Yet it does not take a doctorate in the dismal science to detect that the government's claims about the economy's behaviour have been pretty erratic. After shrinking in 1998, the economy is now supposed to have grown in the first half of last year, only to plunge back into recession in the second six months. Supertankers the size of the world's second-biggest economy should not be able to turn on the spot like this, let alone to perform the trick twice in a year. And it might even be three times: the talk now is that, in the first three months of this year, Japan may clock the fastest growth since the 1970s. 
There are, in any case, several technical reasons for being sceptical about the official figures. Seasonal adjustment seems to have been applied in a crude and archaic fashion. The GDP data have often been hugely revised. Figures for capital investment do not take account of all IT spending, which is growing fast in Japan as elsewhere. And the government seems especially hopeless at measuring personal consumption, which accounts for three-fifths of GDP. 
According to the official figures, after loosening their purse strings early last year, households are now scrimping again, which is why the economy has tipped back into recession. But the government bases its data for household spending on a tiny sample of fewer than 8,ooo households, which it also changes far too often. And the household survey's questions take no account at all of spending in such new, fast-growing areas as mobile telephones. 
Small gleams of hope 
Numbers for retail sales also look weak. But these too are untrustworthy; they are heavily based on old-fashioned retail outlets, which are fast being outflanked by discounters and other innovative chains. Moreover, the GDP figures are disputed by other parts of the government: figures from the Ministry of international Trade and Industry, which seek to measure supply rather than demand, claim that in the third quarter of last year GDP actually grew by 1.1%, and that it remained unchanged in the fourth quarter. 
Confused? You should be. one thing at least is clear: the GDP figures, whether they are right or wrong, measure the past rather than the present. Japan is now almost three months beyond the period reported upon this week, and there are three reasons to think that 2000 is looking better than 1999: 
* A restocking cycle is under way. By last summer, warehouses were looking so bare that firms had to start cranking out more goods simply to refill them. With everybody making more, though, demand rose yet again, because most producers are also consumers. Such a restocking, or inventory, cycle usually lasts about 18 months, suggesting that there is plenty more to come. And, sure enough, the government expects industrial production to rise by 2.3% in the first three months of this year. That would mean the third quarter-on-quarter rise in a row. 
* Business investment is on the rise. The pick-up in industrial production is combining with business restructuring to increase profits. Among 1,8oo listed firms surveyed last month by the Nihon Keizai Shimbun, Japan's top business daily, profits were expected to have grown by 11% in the fiscal year that ends on March 31st. Unlisted firms have been doing better still. in the fourth quarter of 1999, recurring profits at all non-financial firms soared by 42% over the same period in 1998, the fastest growth for 20 years. 
Now that Japanese companies are making more money, they will spend more as well, especially on the sorts of information technologies that have been so popular in America. In the fourth quarter of 1999, capital investment was up by 4.6% over the previous quarter. And it is continuing to rise. Overcapacity at big, listed firms had led to some speculation that investment would keep on falling. But Japan's capital stock has aged and its investment needs are changing (especially towards more IT). Besides, looking only at big firms ignores the growing demands of smaller, unlisted companies. 
*Consumer spending, too, may be picking up. With good statistics so rare, it is hard to be sure about this; and future trends will anyway depend on confidence. in 1998, Japanese households increased the share of their (declining) incomes that they put into savings from an average rate Of 127. in 1990-96 to 15-16%. Now, tentatively, they have begun to save a little less. The rate dropped below 15% in 1999. Once the government brought in a more-or-less credible safety-net, people seemed to become less afraid that Japan's financial system was about to collapse. 
This means that there is plenty of scope for a rapid rise in consumption, if only households can become confident enough to lower their saving rate to the 127. level of the early 1990s and use up some of their past savings. This boost could outweigh the much-touted negative effect of a shake-out of labour as companies restructure-and, in any case, that shake-out might not happen to any great extent if the economy as a whole is recovering, taking incomes and profits up with it. 
Can Japan's timid consumers be convinced that all is well? There is probably little the government can do, since it has already put in the main fixes that it has available: massive fiscal boosts, public money for the banks and emergency loan guarantees for small companies. The Bank of Japan, now formally independent of the government, could also help by loosening monetary policy further (ie, by printing money) in order to oil the wheels of commerce and to seek to reverse the price deflation which is itself restraining consumption. There is no sign of the Bank doing this, however. 
More probably, the government's most immediate role will be a negative one-and the big debate is over whether it will be merely slightly negative or strongly so. The reason is that the governing coalition, dominated by the Liberal Democratic Party and its prime minister, Keizo Obuchi, looks decidedly wobbly. it has to hold a general election by October. Japanese politics is highly unpredictable and, although there are no polls to go by and little sign of pressure for an early election, Mr Obuchi's team might well lose whenever one is held. A new government, if it were a fairly stable, reformist one (a big if), might boost confidence. But meanwhile many deregulatory reforms have been put on ice and even into doubt, as the LDP and its partners seek to avoid annoying any interest groups. Since most Japanese are cynical about politics and feel that it is somewhat detached from real life, this uncertainty will probably be only mildly negative. But a very unstable result in the election could make things more worrying. 
Red tape and other ills 
Beyond that immediate hurdle, and beyond the ever-present worry that a new external shock such as an American recession could harm Japan, the real question is no longer whether recovery is possible but rather whether it can be sustained and even reinforced in the longer term. The short-term picture is, to repeat, looking brighter: at 4.7%, the headline rate of unemployment is still close to a post-war record, but total employment has risen by o.6% in the past six months. overtime and the number of jobs on offer are both up strongly. And the general mood in Japan seems far more positive than it did a year ago. 
In the longer term, the biggest issues-- barriers to turning 2% annual GDP growth, say, into 4% or better-are microeconomic in nature. On this front Japan's usual afflictions of bureaucracy, wasteful investment and a dearth of new businesses hardly inspire cheer. But the latest slump has brought with it new hope of change in Japan's famously hidebound business practices. 
Some economists are drawing parallels with America in the early 19gos. As in America, they hope, a surge in IT investment may be about to deliver many years of productivity-rich growth in Japan. Others see a parallel with America in the 197os and 1980s, as Japan becomes more serious about deregulation, financial reform and opening up to more foreign competition. The most optimistic souls-who must include many share investors, since the Tokyo stockmarket has nearly doubled in value since October 1998-are expecting a restructuring revolution, a supplyside revolution, a shareholder revolution and an Internet revolution, all wrapped up in one. 
Yet the pessimists refuse to be persuaded. Many ofthem stand in awe of America, whose eight-year expansion seems, for now at least, to have left behind boom-andbust economics altogether. So, they argue, has Japan, but for the opposite reason. America keeps booming, but Japan stays bust: both outcomes invite ""structural"" explanations. What is more, Japan's inherent vices become all the more glaring when set beside American virtues. American businesses invest wisely; Japanese ones squander their money. American markets are open and competitive; Japanese ones are closed and cartelised. American businesses face the discipline of competitors and shareholders. Japanese firms hide from both. 
There are certainly grounds for microeconomic concern. Having flirted with deregulation in the mid-1990s, Japan seems to be wavering a bit. Deregulation of the retail industry is threatened by a new law, to be administered by local governments, that may allow small shop owners to block the expansion of big retailers in their neighbourhoods. A year ago, the posts and telecoms ministry was threatening Nippon Telegraph and Telephone (NTT), the incumbent monopoly, with sharp cuts in the interconnection charges it levies on competitors who want to use its network. Thanks to pressure from the ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP), the bureaucrats are now siding with NTT, which is naturally planning a gentler future for itself. 
The banking clean-up has also run into the sands. it was given a firm deadline: April 2001, when the government's full protection of bank deposits was to be replaced with a partial-protection scheme. That would have exposed the weakest lenders to market forces. But the deadline has now been shoved back by at least a year, perhaps more. Ending the emergency programme of loan guarantees has also been delayed by a year. in the middle of recession and financial crisis, such stop-gap measures may have made some sense. But if they are left in place after the economy recovers, they will serve simply to impede structural reform. 
None of this would be quite so worrying if it were not for the government's debts. With gross public debt nearing 150% of national output on some measures, the starting-point is already fairly scary. Equally chilling, though, are the debts that might yet fall due. These include the liabilities of the banks; the small-business loan guarantees (nearing Y60 trillion ($570 billion), or 12% of GDP, at the last count); and money owed by the fiscal investment and loan programme, an off-budget public-spending scheme. Its loans (equal to about 90% Of GDP), which are financed from post-office deposits and administered by the finance ministry, have been bailing out supermarkets, car makers, trading houses and other failing companies. Unless it is promptly withdrawn again, all this extra welfare could become another big drain on the public purse. 
This need not spell disaster, however; there are other ways of cutting public spending. Moreover, as the economy grows, tax revenues will rise and the budget deficit will shrink. On top of this, there is room to raise extra money by increasing taxes or broadening Japan's narrow tax base. Tax revenues amount to just 29% of GDP in Japan, well below the European Union's 42%. 
Simple? Far from it. These emergency budgets, guarantees, loans and other sops have been channelled to core supporters of the LDP year after year, keeping it in power long after its sell-by date. Weaning Japan off deficit spending means taking a knife to the swollen construction industry, whose 570,000 member firms, employing 10% of the workforce (a normal figure among rich countries is 6-7%), offer unswerving loyalty to their generous patron. 
Withdrawing complete insurance of bank deposits similarly threatens the many thousands of shaky credit associations, credit unions, and small regional lenders whose employees turn out regularly to vote for their favourite party. Ending the loan guarantees means exposing firms that shelter under them, such as Japan's 400,000 tiny, inefficient wholesalers. As urban taxpayers have grown ever more disillusioned with the LDP'S money politics, these specialinterest votes have become critical to the party's survival. Despite the efforts of younger LDP reformers to change things, Japan is still ruled by a party for losers, and it is embracing the new ones that the economy has been throwing up with barely concealed glee. It is this political worry that was the real justification for Moody's recent credit warning, despite the economy's improving health. 
Not all Japan's reforms have been derailed, though. And this list includes the most important reform of all: deregulation of the finance industry. Financial deregulation holds the potential to pull apart the keiretsu system of corporate groups, which bind banks and businesses together in big, semi-feudal families. These groups restrict domestic competition, keep foreigners out and stifle the growth of new businesses. With financial deregulation happening late in Japan, banks still control the flow of household savings to industry. This money, however, is allocated by keiretsu relationships, which are cemented with cross-shareholdings. That has meant far too much going to big, mature companies that have largely squandered it. 
Shaking the keiretsu 
However, the ""big bang"" package of financial reforms introduced in 1998 has begun to rot the keiretsu from the inside. As the biggest owners of cross-holdings of shares, the banks sit at the centre of most keiretsu. But more competition and new accounting rules could be encouraging a less sentimental attitude to their cross-shareholdings. Slowly, they are unwinding them. That is one reason why, despite the sharp stockmarket rally, the share price of almost one in two Japanese companies has actually fallen since October 1998. If the banks forsake their role as owner-- lenders, they may make less muddled decisions about their customers, many of whom ought to be put out of business. 
Financial deregulation is also creating new outlets for household savings, such as the fast-growing mutual-fund industry. Since these bypass keiretsu channels, they are free to invest in new, fast-growing industries. Savers are voting with their feet. Three of Japan's ten biggest mutual funds specialise in putting money into small businesses or high-tech industries. Despite all the recent talk of backsliding, it is government deregulation that has provided the opportunities for this new generation of Japanese entrepreneurs, especially in the finance, IT, telecoms and retail industries where most young firms cluster. 
Other forces for change lie beyond the government's grasp altogether. Each of the big six keiretsu has a full set of industrial and financial interests. In the bits of Japan's economy that have opened to trade, however, keiretsu members face a growing dilemma. Bigger, lower-cost foreign competitors are putting pressure on car makers, banks and oil firms to consolidate with others in their industry. But that means stepping outside the warmth of the keiretsu and merging with competitors. Some are braving the cold. Others are dithering. Last year, Mitsui Marine & Fire, an insurance company belonging to the Mitsui group of companies, announced plans to abandon its keiretsu and merge with two other non-life insurers. This year, Mitsui returned to the fold, throwing its lot back in with Sakura Bank, in the Mitsui group. 
The Internet threatens other ancient and malodorous business practices. In Japan's vertically ordered economy, manufacturers have sought to control high-street prices by restricting distribution to their own costly wholesalers and retailers. But the Internet empowers the customer. Recently, Japanese price-discovery websites (which post comparative prices) have begun to combine with powerful new discount retailers to undermine the old, costly ways of distributing goods. 
Something equally invigorating could be taking place among Japanese suppliers in general. These, too, have often been tied to particular manufacturers through cross-shareholdings. Business-to-business e-commerce, with its promise of open, transparent and competitive markets for suppliers and manufacturers, cuts right across the Japanese way of doing things. Already, the consumer-electronics industry's trade association is working on a common data standard that could form the basis of a free-for-all Internet-based market for parts makers and the big manufacturers. 
Deregulation, globalisation and the spread of information technology: the problems facing Japanese companies are no longer as unique as they were. There is no reason to think that the answers they find will be all that different, either. Nor is the government's backward behaviour much at odds with some of Japan's rich-country peers. As in Germany, this may mean only mild expansion, which will also mean that Japan's economy will not soon turn the rest of the world green with envy. But for a country that is only just emerging from its longest-- ever recession, even relatively weak growth is still something to sing about. ","Japan is back in a slump .

In the bits of Japan 's economy that have opened to trade , however , keiretsu members face a growing dilemma . Bigger , lower - cost foreign competitors are putting pressure on car makers , banks and oil firms to consolidate with others in their industry . But that means stepping outside the warmth of the keiretsu and merging with competitors . Some are braving the cold . Others are dithering . Last year , Mitsui Marine & Fire , an insurance company belonging to the Mitsui group of companies , announced plans to abandon its keiretsu and merge with two other non - life insurers . This year , Mitsui returned to the fold , throwing its lot back in with Sakura Bank , in the Mitsui group . 
 The Internet threatens other ancient and malodorous business practices . In Japan 's vertically ordered economy , manufacturers have sought to control high - street prices by restricting distribution to their own costly wholesalers and retailers . But the Internet empowers the customer . Recently , Japanese price - discovery websites ( which post comparative prices ) have begun to combine with powerful new discount retailers to undermine the old , costly ways of distributing goods . 
 Something equally invigorating could be taking place among Japanese suppliers in general . These , too , have often been tied to particular manufacturers through cross - shareholdings . Business - to - business e - commerce , with its promise of open , transparent and competitive markets for suppliers and manufacturers , cuts right across the Japanese way of doing things . Already , the consumer - electronics industry 's trade association is working on a common data standard that could form the basis of a free - for - all Internet - based market for parts makers and the big manufacturers . 
 Deregulation , globalisation and the spread of information technology : the problems facing Japanese companies are no longer as unique as they were . There is no reason to think that the answers they find will be all that different , either . Nor is the government 's backward behaviour much at odds with some of Japan 's rich - country peers . As in Germany , this may mean only mild expansion , which will also mean that Japan 's economy will not soon turn the rest of the world green with envy . But for a country that is only just emerging from its longest-- ever recession , even relatively weak growth is still something to sing about .",740,Japan,A29-8200,IN TERM,True,"the governing coalition , dominated by the Liberal Democratic Party and its prime minister , Keizo Obuchi ,",2,True

SHE departure of the head of government in most countries is quite an event: it raises the possibility of change. Not in Japan, though. After Keizo Obuchi's stroke last weekend, Japan has had to find a new prime minister. No one, however, seems to be looking for any other change; that, most Japanese seem to think, can wait until after the general election, due sometime before the autumn. Indeed, the new man may only serve as a stop-gap. Then a permanent replacement for Mr Obuchi can be found, it is said, and he can ponder some changes. Alas, Japan cannot afford to be so relaxed. 
Not that Mr Obuchi has been a failure. On the contrary, although he once described himself as ""very, very ordinary"", he has done much to end Japan's worst post-war recession. He had staked his reputation on delivering economic growth of at least o.6% for the financial year that ended in March and it looks as though the official figures, when they are published in the summer, will show he has achieved it. Growth of o.6% may seem modest, but Japan is often like a supertanker with the tiller locked. A change of course can be achieved only with immense effort: indeed, if Mr Obuchi has got any growth at all, it will have taken a staggering 35 trillion ($325 billion) in public spending to achieve it. 
Unfortunately, Japan cannot afford to go on running its economy this way. A new leader is required, who could act to unleash the country's enterprise and restore the confidence of its consumers. And he should waste no time in securing a mandate from the voters for the changes that are needed. But that does not seem to be the way that minds have been working in the upper echelons of the ruling Liberal Democratic Party. Mr Obuchi's successor is to be Yoshiro Mori, the LDP's secretary-general, an archetypal politician of the old school (see page 39). No one expects him to last beyond the election. 
The good news is that some people in the LDP may be thinking of bringing the election forward. Mr Obuchi wanted it in the early autumn, because it would then follow better economic news and all the publicity that will attend the prime minister's role at the G8 meeting of the rich world's leaders, plus Russia, in Okinawa in July. But some LDP leaders, worried about the party's dwindling support and hoping no doubt for a sympathy vote, want the election earlier. They are right, albeit for the wrong reasons. An early poll would be good for Japan. Whatever the result, it would provide a new government with a new term of office, instead of an interim one muddling along for six months of uncertainty. 
Muddling along is often the way of consensus-style government in Japan. It may not always lead to disaster, but at present there is work to be done. Urgent economic issues and preparations for the summit are high on the agenda. Mount Usu, a volcano on the island of Hokkaido, is rumbling. And then there is the aftermath of the political eruption caused by Mr Obuchi's rejection of the latest in a series of demands from one of his coalition partners, Ichiro Ozawa, the Liberal leader. Mr Ozawa was forced out as a result, although some members of his party have remained in the ruling coalition. 
In most other countries such events in a leaderless vacuum might amount to a crisis. Not in Japan: the stockmarket hit its highest level of the year this week and the yen rose. That was because Japan is so insulated against change that everyone knows things will go on as expected: the legislative agenda is already in place for the rest of the current session of the Diet (parliament) and the important budget and taxreform bills have already been passed. 
Thief of time 
The trouble is that not much is likely to happen about Japan's long-postponed reforms either. With an election looming, there is already pressure to ease off anything that might upset voters. Several advisory commissions appointed by Mr Obuchi may never report. They have been looking into new ideas about how to reform all sorts of things, from the Diet to education, welfare and the police. 
All of which adds up to one word: delay. The politicians will keep up their factional infighting while the bureaucracy continues to set policy. The real transition from such feudal ways may have to await another generation. Unfortunately, that may also be the generation that inherits all the problems being dodged today: the consequences of a greying society, banks burdened with debts, companies unrestructured and a public sector deep in deficit. Fixing Japan then will not be a job for a Mr Ordinary. The time to get on with it is now. ","It needs a new prime minister with a mandate , soon

WITH Keizo Obuchi incapacitated by a stroke and lying in a coma, the ]apanese cabinet resigned this week so that a new prime minister could be installed. On April 5th, once the barons of the ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) had done their backroom deals, the leadership was handed to Yoshiro Mori, the party's secretary-general. This is what most people had expected. Mr Mori, a burly man who is fond of rugby, is a politician in the traditional mould: a safe party man not known to instigate policy who can be relied upon to continue Mr Obuchi's legislative agenda. Once again, political life goes on much as before in Japan. Except that Mr Mori is, at best, merely a temporary stand-in. 
At 62, the new prime minister is the same age as his predecessor and like him a product of Waseda University, which has produced many of Japan's leading politicians. His career is exactly what is expected of a future leader: a former journalist with a right-wing tabloid newspaper, he has successfully defended his seat in Komatsu nine times and served as minister of education, international trade and industry and, most importantly in Japan, construction. In late 1998, he inherited the leadership of the LDP's third-largest faction. 
There is also the whiff of scandal. Along with several of his LDr colleagues, Mr Mori was found to have made a financial killing during the Recruit ""shares-for-favours"" affair in 1989. Later, during the ""money-and-mob"" scandal of 1992, prosecutors alleged that Mr Mori had offered a gang of right-wing thugs Y2m ($19,ooo) to end a smear campaign that was being waged against his boss, Noboru Takeshita, a former prime minister. An oil trader facing charges of tax evasion, bribery and fraud also claimed in 1997 to have given Mr Mori and several other LDr politicians large payments. Mr Mori denies these allegations strenuously. 
In his first act on taking office, Mr Mori reappointed exactly the same cabinet that had served Mr Obuchi. Into his old job he promoted Hiromu Nonaka, who held a minor post in the LDr. Mr Nonaka, an influential figure, was the power behind the throne in Mr Obuchi's first cabinet in 1998. He was forced into the shadows after a shuffle in October, primarily because of his unremitting hatred of Ichiro Ozawa, the leader of the Liberal Party. Mr Ozawa and his supporters had joined the LDP-led coalition earlier last year. But Mr Obuchi's last act as prime minister was to eject Mr Ozawa from the coalition, rather skilfully. So the LDP no longer has to be nice to him. 
Before being rushed to hospital in the early hours of April znd, Mr Obuchi had met the Liberal leader and called his bluff over his many threats to leave the coalition if his demands were not met. Mr Ozawa had no option but to go. However, 26 of the 5o members of his party refused to follow him into the political wilderness. They formed a new group called the Conservative Party and have been welcomed into the ruling alliance by the cnP and its other coalition partner, the Buddhist-backed New Komeito. Mr Ozawa is now a spent force, which will certainly make life easier for the new prime minister. 
The confrontation with Mr Ozawa is seen by some as hardly helping Mr Obuchi's long-standing heart illness. Whether or not the row played a role in inducing his stroke, the government delayed revealing the seriousness of Mr Obuchi's illness. 
Mr Mori will try to finish off the task his predecessor set: getting japans fragile economy back on its feet. To save the country from financial meltdown, Mr Obuchi introduced public-spending measures worth more than Y35 trillion, much of which was designed to benefit the building industry. He also cut taxes by Y6 trillion and set aside Y60 trillion to bail out Japan's deeply indebted banks. Mr Obuchi had staked his career on getting the economy growing again, by at least 0.6%0 of GDP during the fiscal year that ended in March. 
On the up again 
The enormous amount of public spending has had its effect. Over the past year, the Japanese economy has slowly ceased its downward spiral. Overall, the economy was still in recession during the first three quarters of the past financial year. But, from January to March, growth has been strong. Few people now doubt that Mr Obuchi's o.6%o target will be easily achieved. The trouble is that the seasonally-adjusted figures that will prove it will not be available until early June. So, any bragging about economic revival by the LDP will have to wait until then. 
That raises a tricky issue for Mr Mori: when to call the general election that must be held before October t9th, when the present four-year term of the lower house of the Diet (parliament) ends. His predecessor was planning to call the election after the summit meeting of the G7 leaders of the rich world, plus Russia, which is to be held this year in Okinawa in late July. Apart from hoping to boost his waning popularity by being seen on television hobnobbing with other world leaders, Mr Obuchi viewed the Okinawa summit as a feather in his cap. 
It was, of course, Japan's turn to hold the summit this year, but it was Mr Obuchi's idea to hold it in the congenial surroundings of Japan's most southerly prefecture. By doing so he hoped to buy off local residents who have been objecting to the decision to build a new American helicopter base in Okinawa. The summit would bring Okinawa some useful publicity and, more tangibly, a huge building boom. 
Mr Obuchi was also intending to use the summit to present himself as the spokesman for Asia, a role he has tried to shape for himself during overseas visits. Mr Mori, however, is a man with his feet firmly planted in his own prefecture's rural mud and someone who has never acquired much of a taste for global statesmanship. Many Asian leaders therefore fear that Japan will now be less generous with the aid that Mr Obuchi had been doling out in the region. 
Of more immediate concern to Mr Mori's colleagues is the coming election. Some have badgered the new prime minister to call a snap poll. The idea is that this would capitalise on the public outpouring of sorrow at seeing Mr Obuchi struck down so tragically. The new prime minister, however, is not expected to do that. He will probably go to the polls in early June, earlier than Mr Obuchi had planned, but safely after the cnr figures are published. 
Mr Mori is nothing if not a pragmatist. He knows he is merely a stop-gap prime minister whose main job is to steer the party through a general election without losing too many seats. Japan will then need a heavyweight leader who can get on with the serious tasks that still confront the country. Above all, that person will have to start to deal with the painful process of reducing the country's woeful level of long-term debt. Thanks to Mr Obuchi's generous spending, Japan now has the largest public-sector debt in the developed world: it stands at 174% of GDr, according to some measures. 
The man being groomed to take over is Koichi Kato, a former diplomat who leads the second-largest faction of the LDP. He got on the wrong side of Mr Obuchi by daring to oppose him when he was making a bid for a second term as party president, and thus prime minister. Once the election is over, Mr Kato is likely, however, to emerge on top. ","Yoshiro Mori has taken over as Japan 's prime minister , although few people think he will be in the job for long

Apart from hoping to boost Keizo Obuchi's waning popularity by being seen on television hobnobbing with other world leaders , Keizo Obuchi viewed the Okinawa summit as a feather in Keizo Obuchi's cap . 
 It was , of course , Japan 's turn to hold the summit this year , but it was Keizo Obuchi's idea to hold it in the congenial surroundings of Japan 's most southerly prefecture . By doing so Keizo Obuchi hoped to buy off local residents who have been objecting to the decision to build a new American helicopter base in Okinawa . The summit would bring Okinawa some useful publicity and , more tangibly , a huge building boom . 
 Keizo Obuchi was also intending to use the summit to present Keizo Obuchi as the spokesman for Asia , a role Keizo Obuchi has tried to shape for Keizo Obuchi during overseas visits . Mr Mori , however , is a man with his feet firmly planted in his own prefecture 's rural mud and someone who has never acquired much of a taste for global statesmanship . Many Asian leaders therefore fear that Japan will now be less generous with the aid that Keizo Obuchi had been doling out in the region . 
 Of more immediate concern to Mr Mori 's colleagues is the coming election . Some have badgered the new prime minister to call a snap poll . The idea is that this would capitalise on the public outpouring of sorrow at seeing Keizo Obuchi struck down so tragically . The new prime minister , however , is not expected to do that . He will probably go to the polls in early June , earlier than Keizo Obuchi had planned , but safely after the cnr figures are published . 
 Mr Mori is nothing if not a pragmatist . He knows he is merely a stop - gap prime minister whose main job is to steer the party through a general election without losing too many seats . Japan will then need a heavyweight leader who can get on with the serious tasks that still confront the country . Above all , that person will have to start to deal with the painful process of reducing the country 's woeful level of long - term debt . Thanks to Keizo Obuchi's generous spending , Japan now has the largest public - sector debt in the developed world : it stands at 174 % of GDr , according to some measures . 
 The man being groomed to take over is Koichi Kato , a former diplomat who leads the second - largest faction of the LDP . He got on the wrong side of Keizo Obuchi by daring to oppose Keizo Obuchi when Keizo Obuchi was making a bid for a second term as party president , and thus prime minister . Once the election is over , Mr Kato is likely , however , to emerge on top .",740,Japan,A29-8200,IN TERM,True,Keizo Obuchi,35,True

BY ANY measure but volume, Japan is already a big noise in Asia. Its economy is second only to America's in the world. It is the region's most generous financial supporter of less well-off countries both near and far. And it has the bestequipped soldiers and sailors in East Asia after America's. Until now Japan has deliberately understated its weight, not only to allay fears that it would again throw it about militarily, as it did in the i93os and i94os, but also because, protected comfortably by America, it has had little need for a distinctive regional voice. That has changed. Today's Japan wants, and deserves, more credit for all that it does to uphold Asia's stability and prosperity. And the role Japan needs to play is itself also changing. 
Japan's ambitions do not stop at Asia. It makes no secret of its longing for a permanent seat on the United Nations Security Council. It has supported UN peacekeeping and reconstruction efforts, not just in Cambodia and East Timor, but also in the Middle East, Bosnia and Kosovo. It has its own ideas for reforming the big international financial institutions, the IMF and the World Bank, which its new prime minister, if he survives the general election likely next month (see page 41), will press at the c8 summit of rich nations plus Russia, to be held off Okinawa in July. Japan's is a respected voice in the world's top clubs. But it is in Asia where Japan finds it hardest to strike the right tone. 
Earlier this year, its since-stricken prime minister, Keizo Obuchi, toured the region, offering, as this year's c8 host, to be the voice of Asia at the world's top tables. In some places, he got an encouraging hearing. Although history still makes some people reluctant to see Japan take a more prominent role, more suspicion these days attaches to China, the other potential voice of Asia. The inflexibility of its Communist-led government, its bullying of smaller fry over claims in the South China Sea, and its warlike threats against Taiwan all make Asia's most populous power seem a growing challenge to, rather than a steadying support for, regional stability. 
Only recently, things looked different. When Asia's financial crisis started in 1997, Japan seemed paralysed by an economic recession of its own making. Some nervous eyes around the region turned to China, which was given credit for statesmanship in not devaluing its currency and so adding to the turmoil. Yet China's economy has nasty problems piling up behind its wobbly financial Great Wall. Meanwhile, Japan, for all its continuing troubles, has by now forked out some $70 billion of a promised $80 billion in assistance to countries worst affected by the region's turbulence. Investments around Asia by Japanese companies are picking up again. A string of investment agreements and schemes for technical help are being planned with the countries of South-East Asia. 
It is not just the region's economic woes that have prodded Japan into a more activist role. The end of the cold war in Asia brought no walls or iron curtains crashing down. Indeed its chief relic, the over-armoured border between North and South Korea, still endures. The end of superpower hostilities has, however, allowed the ice to be chipped off some regional rivalries-between America and China, China and Japan and the like. Unfortunately, this has added new instabilities to the regional balance. Meanwhile, the proliferation of missiles and the nuclear, chemical and biological weapons they might deliver is racing faster in Asia than almost anywhere. 
Faced with a rising China and an understandable reluctance on the part of America to go on carrying every military burden, successive Japanese governments have started to shoulder more of the region's security tasks. A crucial step was to reinforce Japan's security alliance with America, by agreeing to help a bit more with logistical tasks, should American forces, still the main guarantors of peace in the region, be drawn into a conflict. It is no longer taboo in Japan to argue for reinterpretation of the constitution to allow the armed forces to do more of the harder security tasks, alongside America or the UN. And Japan now plays a modest role in UN peacekeeping, though it still shies away from more confrontational enforcement, of the sort needed in East Timor. Last week it offered to mount joint coastguard exercises and patrols with others to combat piracy in Asian waters. 
Not so much a megaphone as a microphone 
Japan's new activism is as controversial at home as it is abroad. Debate is sharpened by the threat from North Korea's increasingly long-range missiles that can now hit any city in Japan, and by the increasingly bitter dispute between China and Taiwan. Japan knows that in the event of a conflict involving American forces either on the Korean peninsula or in the Taiwan Strait, it could not expect simply to stand aside. It is alarmed, however, that it might be drawn into a crisis with next to no consultation beforehand. Having a bigger voice in decisions that affect its own security is another good reason for Japan to move sooner, rather than later, to increase the help it can offer: the extent to which your voice is listened to in Washington depends on how much you bring to the table. 
Asia is too complex a region to speak, or be spoken for, with one voice. Yet a Japan that stands taller, that speaks out more confidently about how it sees the region's problems and not only writes cheques, but also joins close allies to do more security-enhancing tasks, would be a benefit to all.

DESPITE being bedridden for the past year, Noboru Takeshita, a master puppeteer, has been running Japan's ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) from his pillows-shaping political events, big and small, throughout the land. But the stringpulling from behind the scenes is about to fall slack. On May 1st, after 42 years in the Diet (parliament), Mr Takeshita announced that he was retiring from politics. Turmoil has now broken out within the party as its lesser barons, caught off guard once again by the wily old manipulator, try to snatch the cords of power. 
A month ago, the 76-yearold Mr Takeshita, though racked with spinal pain, had every intention of standing for a 15th term in the forthcoming general election, which is expected to be held on June 25th. What made him change his mind was the collapse of Keizo Obuchi, the last of the proteges he had anointed as prime minister. Mr Obuchi suffered a stroke on April 1st and remains in hospital, paralysed and on a life-support machine. His demise seems to bring an era to an end. 
Mr Takeshita was the embodiment of Japan's ""1955 political system"", in which the LDP ruled with comfortable majorities in both the upper and the lower house of the Diet. The LDP kept its grip on power partly by using its regulatory powers to protect the small shopkeepers, farmers, manufacturers and building firms who were its core supporters, partly by gerrymandering rural districts. This forced the predominantly urban opposition parties to collect up to three votes for every LDP vote in order to win a seat. The opposition, led by the Japanese Socialist Party (as it was then called), was kept tame by under-the-table handouts and an understanding that the LDP and its proxies would not contest the third or fourth seats in many of the bigger multi-seat constituencies. 
Mr Takeshita thrived in such a world of consensus politics, quietly preparing the ground so things could happen by agreed compromise. Though forced to resign in 1989 after only two years as prime minister as a result of the Recruit ""shares-for-favours"" scandal, Mr Takeshita still had the final say on who should get the top jobs in politics. The last of his lieutenants to be made prime minister were Ryutaro Hashimoto and Mr Obuchi. Though belonging to a different factional family within the LDP, Mr Obuchi's successor, Yoshiro Mori, won the job only after Mr Takeshita had given his approval. 
And that is the problem. The political faction Mr Takeshita created in 1987 and later handed over to Mr Obuchi was the biggest, best endowed and, above all, the most cohesive. Now, with Mr Takeshita and Mr Obuchi out of the picture, and several stalwarts such as Seiroku Kajiyama also deciding to call it quits, the LDP's kingmaker faction is bereft of talent at the top. Its up-and-comers are in their 50s, and at least five years away from being considered ready to become leader. 
Insiders expect the present chief cabinet secretary, Mikio Aoki, aged 65, an upperhouse member from Mr Takeshita's district in western Japan, to take over the faction for the time being. It would be the first time that someone from the less-than-influential upper house had played such a role. More to the point, the mild-mannered Mr Aoki, though well-liked in parliament, commands little respect from the party rank and file. Pundits believe that a stronger character, such as Hiromu Nonaka, the LDP's secretary-general, will be made joint leader to help keep the troops in line. 
Come what may, however, few expect the old Takeshita faction to maintain its former influence and cohesion. Equally, none of the LDP's three other main factions-one led by Koichi Kato, another by Mr Mori and the third by Taku Yamasaki-is big enough to take command. And if the LDP does as badly as expected in the coming election, its structure could begin to fall apart. Japanese politics would then be in for a period of big change. 
If the party were to split along ideological lines, its more liberal, reform-minded members would be expected to form up behind an internationalist such as Mr Kato, a former general secretary of the party. Mr Kato was relegated to the sidelines by Mr Obuchi for having the temerity to challenge him for the leadership. From the wilderness, Mr Kato has continued to attack the LDP for its ill-considered spending on public works and for propping up troubled banks and building companies. 
Optimists say Japan's economic reconstruction would accelerate dramatically if reformers such as Mr Kato and like-minded colleagues from other factions, including Mr Yamasaki and Junichiro Koizumi, a former health minister, could only get their act together. A few years ago, the liberal wing of the LDP hoped that the ""YKK"" trio would be the next to take command, and help steer the party away from its profligate ways. 
Pessimists fear that the LDP's more reactionary wing may prevail, with the party remaining heavily committed to big publicspending programmes and special-interest politics. Many in the party would support such an outcome. More than 100 LDP members recently formed a group to get the government to abandon further economic reforms, claiming they were turning voters off; the worry is that, apart from wanting to turn the clock back, an LDP under the sway of conservatives such as the party's policy chief, Shizuka Kamei, could easily turn xenophobic as well as reactionary. Welcoming back old nationalists like Ichiro Ozawa-one of Mr Takeshita's former lieutenants who stormed out of the LDP in 1993 with his followers after losing the succession battle to Mr Obuchi-would be only the beginning. 
What if a more reactionary LDP decided it wanted a super-nationalist like Shintaro Ishihara back within the Fold? The outspoken governor of Tokyo is easily the most charismatic politician in Japan. Mr Ishihara, who wrote the book ""A Japan That Can Say No"" with Sony's late boss, Akio Morita, left the LDP in disgust because of its weak-kneed ways. He is literate, intelligent, energeticand unfortunately holds some ugly views about foreigners. His current targets for abuse are China and the Korean and Taiwanese communities within Japan. Last week he made headlines with an attack on ""expansionist"" China. He was quoted as saying, If Japan gives way in the face of this expansionism, this will spread throughout Asia.Japan now feels a crisis over China. We are in a state of cold war, which in some ways is more dangerous than the old cold war. 
The thought of an LDP under Mr Ishihara's populist influence is alarming. That is why, once the election is over, the fight for the soul of the party will really begin. ","As the old political masters bow out , who will take power in the ruling party ?

A foreign commentator uncharitably compared him to a cold pizza when he took office in July 1998. The unperturbable Mr Obuchi responded by buying pizza for reporters at his first news conference. Asked if he clashed with the forceful Hiromu Nonaka, then chief cabinet secretary, Mr Obuchi said, ""I don't have any ideas, so there's nothing to clash about "" He gave the impression of having no enemies, but it was an impression only. Mr Obuchi was a master of deception, a skill honed during nearly four decades of survival in the back-stabbing world of Japan's factional politics. 
Politics was in the family. His father, Mitsuhei Obuchi, was one of four representatives in the Diet (parliament) for a district in Gunma, a rural prefecture. In 1963, when his father died, Mr Obuchi won his seat for the Liberal Democratic Party, which has governed Japan for most of the period since the mid-i95os. At 26 he was one of the youngest members to be elected to the Diet. It was his misfortune that two other seats in his district were held by Takeo Fukuda, a plutocrat, and Yasuhiro Nakasone, a popular rightwinger, both men powerful Liberal Democrats, and later to be prime ministers. Throughout his political career, Mr Obuchi lived under their shadow-the ""noodle shop between two skyscrapers"", as he put it. Mr Obuchi's answer was to take off his jacket and tie, don his rubber boots and talk to farmers in the fields, building a reputation as Mr Ordinary, the people's representative. ""Good-natured Obuchi"" was born. 
The new godfather 
For Keizo Obuchi the bit of luck that every politician needs was to catch the eye of Noboru Takeshita, who built the largest and most influential faction within the Liberal Democrats. Mr Takeshita, now a bedridden 76 and on the point of retiring, emerged as the godfather of Japanese politics during the latter half of the i98os. Though forced to resign as prime minister by a bribery scandal in 1989, Mr Takeshita has continued to dominate Japanese politics as the ""shogun in the shadows"" ever since. 
It says much for Mr Obuchi's ability to slug it out with the toughest that he took control of the Takeshita Faction, when many in the party assumed that the faction would go to one of Mr Takeshita's three formidable lieutenants, Ryutaro Hashimoto, Tsutomu Hata and Ichiro Ozawa. The battle for control in 1993 left blood on the Diet Floor as Mr Ozawa eventually stormed out of the party with some 40 of his followers. So much for Mr Obuchi, the plodding nobody. 
The bust-up left the party without a majority in the Diet's lower house, causing it to lose its grip on power for the first time in four decades. That Mr Obuchi was able to restore the old Takeshita faction to its position of power confirmed his abilities as a consummate backroom operator. The party regained its lowerhouse majority in 1996, and Mr Obuchi was rewarded in 1998 with the prime ministership. Still, even some insiders were surprised. ""He rose to power while no one was watching,"" said one. 
How will history judge Mr Obuchi and his 2o-month stewardship? On becoming prime minister, he promised only one thing: to put an end to Japan's worst recession in more than 50 years. The cnr figures to be released in June will confirm that he did just about achieve that, although, given the staggering amount of taxpayers' money that Mr Obuchi poured into public works, ailing companies and banks that were about to go bust, it would have been a surprise if the economy had not begun to show flickers of life. Nevertheless, after nearly a decade of floundering, the Japanese economy has finally begun to move forwards rather than backwards, recording 0.6% growth during the financial year that ended in March. 
There were other gains during his brief watch. In partnership with Mr Ozawa's small Liberal Party and later with the Buddhistbacked New Komeito, the Liberal Democrats under Mr Obuchi managed to enact a remarkable number of controversial measures. The long-delayed legislation for beefing up Japan's security alliance with America was one of the first to breeze through. Laws for reforming central government, improving the disclosure of public information, designating the Hinomaru (Red Sun) as the national flag, and the Kimigayo as the national anthem were all enacted surprisingly quickly. Within the Diet, Mr Obuchi initiated research panels in the lower and upper houses to review the constitution; and he abolished the long-standing habit of having senior bureaucrats rather than cabinet ministers answer questions. For the first time, the prime minister allowed himself to be grilled by the opposition during specially assigned question-times. 
After suffering a stroke on April znd, Mr Obuchi remained in a coma for six weeks. He died on May i4th. The party is calling a general election for June a5th, Mr Obuchi's birthday. A tribute to a decent man, says the party. A bid for a sympathy vote, say those familiar with the ways of Japanese politics, among whom there was no one more knowledgeable than Keizo Obuchi. ","WITH Keizo Obuchi's self - deprecating humour and Keizo Obuchi's humility , Keizo Obuchi seemed an unlikely choice as prime minister of Japan . A foreign commentator uncharitably compared Keizo Obuchi to a cold pizza when Keizo Obuchi took office in July 1998 . Keizo Obuchi responded by buying pizza for reporters at Keizo Obuchi's first news conference .

A SURE sign that Japan's ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) is about to make a disastrous showing in the coming general election is the way the country's leading conservative newspaper, Yomiuri Shimbun, has become so rattled. Instead of its usual measured tone when dealing with politics, it has offered emotional outbursts about the opposition's unfair tactics.It is clear that the unfortunate Yoshiro Mori, who became prime minister after Keizo Obuchi collapsed on April and, and later died, will win no votes for the LDP on June 25th. His approval rating in the opinion polls plummeted to 19% in May from 41% in April, the lowest ever for a Japanese prime minister who is about to fight a general election. 
Out in the constituencies, LDP officials are hurriedly taking down the prime minister's picture and cancelling plans for him to speak. Low as it is, Mr Mori's popularity could sink lower. On May 30th, four of the main opposition parties tabled a no-confidence motion in the Diet (parliament) arising out of Mr Mori's remarks to a Shinto political league about Japan being a ""divine nation with the emperor at its centre"". 
Cracking the whip 
The prime minister certainly meant no harm. He was a member of a now-defunct group of right-wing Diet members who sought to revive the spirit of the old Meiji constitution, which enshrined the emperor as ""sacred and inviolable"". But Mr Mori does rather put his foot in it. Earlier, he claimed that the ""imperial rescript on education"" of 1890, which laid the foundation for]apanese militarism and emperor worship, was not all bad. Unabashed by the reaction to his latest remarks, Mr Mori professed to have nothing to feel sorry about. But that was before the LDP's chieftains cracked the whip and forced the prime minister to bow deeply and make a formal apology. 
Hiromu Nonaka, the LDP's tough secretary-general, reminded Mr Mori that he was prime minister 24 hours a day and whenever he opened his mouth he did so as the leader of the country. Unfortunately, the prime minister only made matters worse for himself, and the LDP: he offered regrets but then refused to retract his remarks. 
The opposition parties cannot believe their good fortune. What is so worrying for the LDP is that Mr Mori's gaffe, which harps back to Japan's militaristic past, has not in it-- selfbothered many people. The Japanese are far too sensible to fear for their democratic institutions. But they are appalled by the prime minister's lack of political astuteness. Mr Mori has become that most unacceptable of things in Japan: an embarrassment. 
Some senior Lnr members have even been talking about dumping Mr Mori before the june z5th election or getting the polling day put off for a month or two. That is now impossible. The Diet was due to be dissolved on June 2nd. To limit the damage, the ruling party has started telling its supporters in the field to plan for an even worse election result than previously expected. Hidenao Nakagawa, a senior party official and a close friend of the prime minister, puts the party's expectations at no more than 215 seats (down from its present 267) out of what will be a 480-seat lower house. By Mr Nakagawa's reasoning, anything better than that ought to be considered a success, and Mr Mori might then be spared from resignation. 
Although a considerable loss, such an outcome could still give the Lnr, with its two small coalition partners, the New Komeito and the Conservative Party, a majority in the house and allow it to keep control of the main committees. But the Buddhist-backed New Komeito is still smouldering over Mr Mori's allusions to the ethnic purity of statesponsored Shintoism, and may demand Mr Mori's head as the price for staying in the coalition. The New Komeito was given the final say about making Mr Mori prime minister. He should really have been more respectful of New Komeito's main sponsor, the Soka Gakkai, whose founder, Tsunesaburo Makiguchi, was imprisoned during the war because of his opposition to state-sponsored Shintoism. 
As the campaign gathers pace, the LDr leadership is doing its utmost to keep the prime minister out of harm's way. A record turnout is expected, another plus for the opposition. Mr Nonaka must be regretting that he manipulated events to put the amiable but disaster-prone Mr Mori in charge. ","TOKYO

How impressive it was, they said, that he became the most powerful man in Japanese politics without ever displaying anger. As a young man, it was recalled, he became known as the ""master of the draw"" in judo for avoiding easy victories over weaker opponents while averting defeat from stronger ones. Shin Kanemaru, Mr Takeshita's close political ally, saw him as ""a sashimi knife"", filleting out any bones of contention. 
Some found his quietness a touch eerie, and believed it could be traced back to the suicide of his young wife when he was away in the army in the second world war. Jacob Schlesinger says in his book ""Shadow Shoguns"" that, thereafter, the young Noboru Takeshita suppressed his emotions and became obsessed with composure and self-control, vowing never, no matter what the circumstances, to show anger again. 
He remarried, this time a distant relative, and became an English teacher, although he knew little of the language. He turned to the new ""democratic"" politics imposed by the victors at the end of the war. In Shimane, his local prefecture, he showed a talent for organisation, turning a group of volunteers into an efficient campaign machine that got him elected to the local assembly in 1951. Seven years later, he won a seat for the Liberal Democratic Party in the lower house of the Diet (parliament). The LDp had been the ruling party since its foundation in 1955 and was to continue to run Japan decade after decade almost without a break. As the LAP prospered, so did Mr Takeshita, inside the party and in government, and he shares both the credit and the blame for its record. In 1985, as finance minister, he helped to manipulate the yen to drive the now notorious ""bubble economy"", the effects of which are still present in Japan. He finally made it in 1987 as prime minister. But it was not done alone. None of this would have been possible without the help of Shin Kanemaru. Mr Takeshita may have been a sashimi knife, but Mr Kanemaru was, as he described himself, ""a hatchet"". 
The bid for power 
They had been close friends from 1958 when both won seats in the Diet for the first time. Both of their families were sake brewers; both fathers had been big wheels in local politics. Noboru Takeshita's eldest daughter married Shin Kanemaru's eldest son. Mr Kanemaru, physically muscular and ten years older than his diminutive friend, saw himself as very much his guardian. When Kakuei Tanaka, the boss of their faction, was weakened after being accused, among other misdeeds, of taking bribes, the two men set about taking over. 
Kakuei Tanaka has become a son of legend, practising on a vast scale what Americans call porkbarrel politics: keeping constituencies sweet with public works projects, which in turn kept his business backers happy. He resigned as prime minister in 1974, but remained immensely popular even after he was convicted, and never went to jail. He remained a big influence in politics until his death in 1993. 
However, in 1987, when the Takeshita-Kanemaru team finally made their bid for his faction, he was too ill to resist, and every member switched to a newly formed Keiseikai (Wise government) faction and Mr Takeshita was made prime minister. These were the days of what seemed, on the surface, a battle between the pro-business Liberal Democratic Party and the Japan Socialist Party. In reality it was more a carefully scripted charade than any serious conflict of ideology. While the hatchet man and deal-maker, Mr Kanemaru, managed the opposition with wads of money passed beneath the table, the wily Mr Takeshita ran the government using his extensive network within the ruling party and the upper echelons of the bureaucracy. Thus, even the most contentious bits of legislation--the introduction of a consumption tax, the liberalisation ofthe heavily protected beef, citrus and (later) rice markets, even an enhanced security pact with America-were allowed to work their way through the Diet and into law. 
Mr Takeshita was prime minister for only 18 months before he resigned over involvement in corrupt share dealing. He remained, though, a power in politics, in the manner of the deposed Kakuei Tanaka, deciding who should rule. Keizo Obuchi; the prime minister who died last month (Obituary, May zoth), was a protege. For the past year Mr Takeshita has been guiding the LDP's power brokers from his sickbed, still the puppet master. 
It sounds banal to write of an end of an era for Japanese politics, if only because that era, a dizzy mixture of brilliance and corruption, has been so reluctant to come to an end. But now the old manipulators have gone: Tanaka, Kanemaru, in disgrace in 1996, Obuchi, prematurely, and now Takeshita. The idea of a passing age seemed to be confirmed with the death on June i6th of dowager Empress Nagako, aged 97, the widow of Emperor Hirohito, who himself killed off the idea of royal divinity.

SIR-Tony Blair (""Merciful defeat"", June 24th) claims that football hooligans are not representative of the English national character (significantly he did not refer to the Scottish or Welsh, who must be grateful to him for once). Where else do xenophobic tabloids enjoy daily circulations of several million and regularly publish frankly racist articles directed for the most part at England's close neighbours? 
English football hooliganism is the extreme, physical demonstration of an English culture of prejudice which ranges from a general feeling of dislike and distrust of ""foreigners"" to the more excessive expressions of xenophobia found in the tabloid newspapers or in pub talk across England on any Saturday night. 
Saint Vincent des Bois, France MICHAEL GREEN 
Sir-You say that ""English fans' attempts to blame foreign policemen for their riots have become a tired refrain."" But the claim that over-zealous policing led to the abuse and arrest of many fans who were involved in nothing that could remotely be described as rioting deserves further investigation, rather than to be dismissed out of hand. 
That is not to deny that a small number of troublemakers need to be dealt with firmly, preferably in a way which prevents them getting anywhere near a football ground again. However, it is not yet a crime to be English or to visit a town where a football match is taking place.

Miller lite 
SIR-You conclude your obituary of Merton Miller June 10th) by revealing that, despite his belief in the efficiency of markets, he would occasionally take a flyer on a company's shares. There was another respect in which he tempered his economic beliefs. About ten years ago, I was sitting with him at a small dinner and the conversation turned to beer. He revealed that though he was opposed to all government regulation he would make an exception for the German beer-purity laws. Cambridge, Massachusetts ADAM JARED APT 
Pond life 
SIR-You describe Peter Pond, the first European to encounter the Alberta tar sands, as a British explorer (""Pay dirt"", June 17th). Indeed most of western Canada was first mapped and explored by young Scottish fur traders such as Alexander Mackenzie and Simon Fraser, after whom some major north-west waterways are named. Like those of Mackenzie, Fraser and others, Pond's explorations were also driven by the fur trade, and the search for the mythical ""North-West Passage"". 
However, Pond was not British but a New England Yankee, noted for his fierce competitive spirit and shrewd trading abilities. Perhaps this explains (with a few other intervening bits of history) why even today it is principally American companies that have developed and derived benefit from the Alberta tar sands. 
Edmonton, Canada JIM HARVEY 
Online regulation 
SIR-I was surprised to see you call for an international regulator for e-commerce (""Regulating the Internet"", June 10th). Protection of intellectual property and taxation are traditionally the domain of governments and given the global nature of the Internet, governments must develop a co-ordinated approach to prevent a patchwork of potentially inconsistent rules. Business worldwide does not believe that privacy and consumer protection fall into the same category as intellectual property and taxation. The United States Council for International Business is developing and promoting self regulation for online commerce. The ""Global Business Action Plan"" includes 60 self regulatory initiatives from around the world.

Spectrum of opinion SIR-Qualcomm (Face value, June 17th) may have perfected but did not invent the technology known as code division multiple access (CDMA). As you have said, in 1940 Hedy Lamar (Obituary, January 29th) and a film-score composer, George Antheil, developed the technology, then called spread spectrum. The two received a patent for it in 1942. Spread spectrum was first used by the allies in the Pacific campaigns of the second world war, where it foiled Japanese attempts to jam radio-controlled torpedoes. More recently, it was married to digital technologies in secret battlefield-communications systems. 
There are now several varieties of spread spectrum, including CDMA, so named because the spreading is achieved by a code and its use permits multiple access to transmission facilities, as in mobile-phone systems.

Called to account 
SIR-Accountability systems underpin the democratic process and their effectiveness should be kept under constant scrutiny (""Who audits the auditors?"", June roth). In Britain the picture is mixed. On retrospective financial accountability the process is broadly effective; on the relationship between Parliament and the executive more generally, the balance is currently quite wrong and getting worse. 
You criticise the process of checking the factual accuracy of National Audit Office reports with the body subject to audit It is important to emphasise that the conclusions and recommendations of NAO reports are for the comptroller and auditor-general alone. Also this process is not a weakness but a strength, as it prevents witnesses denying facts and allows the committee to reach clear conclusions unfettered by disputes over the data. 
You call for a more interventionist auditing system, citing America's General Accounting Office as a model, but the cwo works because congressional committees are more interventionist. While I would strongly support an independent investigating ann of Parliament like the Gwo reporting to all select committees on policy issues, this should be a separate body from the Nwo as its remit rightly excludes policy matters. 
Parliamentary scrutiny and accountability require more attention. Select committees have done much but have not achieved their full potential. The select committees' chairmen have called for radical improvements, including more resources, greater transparency and an alternative career structure for backbench MPs. So far the government has rejected the proposals.

Asylum-seekers 
SIR-It is good of jean-Christian Lambelet (Letters, June 10th) to point out how kind-hearted the Swiss were between September and December 1942 to admit 96% of the Jewish asylum-seekers who presented themselves at the border. For asylum-seekers to have made it past the Gestapo and other population-control elements at this time would have been a remarkable achievement. I wonder what motivated the Swiss to throw back the unfortunate 4%.

Two Africas 
SIR-The sharp contrast between the article regarding our study of private capital flows to Africa (""More than expected"", June 3rd) and the image of the ""hopeless continent"" (May 13th) highlights the dangers of painting with too broad a brush. Countries such as Ghana, Uganda and South Africa, as well as Botswana, Mauritius and Namibia, are led by competent governments that are dealing systematically with a range of policy issues and achieving reasonable results. 
Among the most difficult problems faced by these countries is managing the effects of an increasingly volatile external environment. Swings in crossborder capital flows all too frequently dominate a range of monetary, regulatory, fiscal- and social-policy decisions because the broad-brush approach also characterises many international investors in Africa. The result is a powerful herd instinct driving staggering sums of money into and out of these small economies on the flimsiest of justifications. 
The challenges posed by volatile cross-border capital flows make institution-building a top priority in all of these countries. We at the Centre for Research into Economics and Finance in Southern Africa, at the London School of Economics, and External Finance for Africa are involved in projects in more than 15 African countries aimed at enhancing their ability to monitor and to manage volatile international capital flows. Some of these countries are setting up such systems for the first time, but others are embracing new techniques that to date have only been adopted by a handful of the most developed industrial economies. Is it perhaps time to think at least in terms of two Africas?

SIR-Here is a simple solution to the problems of assuring a fair trial of an accused who cannot of ford to pay a lawyer (""Murder One"", June 17th). Let the responsible attorney-general appoint two of his staff to handle the trial. One will represent the people, the other the accused. Which counsellor will represent which side will then be determined by the accused or by a flip of a coin. The resources accessible to each in preparing and prosecuting the case will be equivalent. 
So much for the destitute, the next question is how such a system would work for the affluent, O J. Simpson, for example. I can hear trial lawyers yelping already.

Financial disservice 
SIR-You are wrong to suggest in your article on the passage of the Financial Services and Markets Bill that concerns over the Financial Services Authority's lack of accountability have been assuaged by recent government amendments (""Passed at last"", June 10th). Accountability is still thin on the ground. Contrary to good practice, the roles of chairman and chief executive are still not separated; the role of nonexecutive directors of the FSA is heavily circumscribed in the bill; the provisions for consultation of the practitioners panel are feeble; the Fsw is immune from suit for damages; and there is virtually no direct accountability to Parliament of those holding the unprecedentedly large public powers which the FSA will possess. 
Accountability is only one area among many which are of concern. Our paper for the Centre for Policy Studies, ""Leviathan at Large"", identified a number of problems with which the government has refused to deal. For example, the market-abuse provisions will create uncertainty; the objectives of the FSA do not include the promotion of the competitiveness of Britain's financial sector, and some of the provisions may also be challenged under the Human Rights Act. 
All of this adds up to a piece of legislation that is seriously flawed. The government should at the very least agree to a full-scale independent review of the bill after two years' operation, as many have recommended.

Off his Rocker 
SIR-You assert that major league baseball's sanctions of John Rocker for making racially insensitive comments are unprecedented and unjustified (Lexington, June 10th). This is inaccurate and misguided. First, the Cincinnati owner, Marge Schott, was suspended for a year for making similar racist and anti-Semitic comments; she was later pressured to sell her controlling interest in the team. 
Second, as an industry dependent on the willingness of the public to pay to watch its employees work, baseball has an interest in ensuring that those employees do not alienate large numbers of potential customers. As baseball has been lagging far behind other sports in its appeal to many of the people whom Mr Rocker insulted, it is perfectly reasonable for the sport's management to try to mitigate the business effects of his rantings. 
Bloomington, Indiana. JOHN SUMMERS 
SIR-You miss two points about Mr Rocker's role in American popular culture. First, unlike the other athlete-criminals you mention he has refused to show remorse for his actions. Indeed, he has chalked up the remarks to youthful indiscretion. His threats to the writer of the infamous article demonstrate that Mr Rocker is more sorry that he was called on his conduct than truly changed by the turn of events. 
And consider the response Mr Rocker received in his first game back in Atlanta Following his reduced punishment; he was welcomed with a standing ovation and defiantly sprinted to the mound. It stands as the ugliest moment in a sordid tale: the white majority's willingness to discount the incident as a folly of youth and return to business, or baseball, as usual.

Freeing West Papua 
SIR-The promise of strong support for Indonesia's territorial integrity adroitly extracted from Australia's prime minister, John Howard, by President Abdurrahman Wahid at Keizo Obuchi's funeral is very alarming. The case for West Papuan independence (""Indonesia's other separatists"", June 10th) is even stronger than East Timor's since its culture is even more alien. Cold-war panic cannot excuse Australia's guilt in failing to stand up to Indonesia's invasion of West Papua in 1962, failing to condemn the farcical ""acts of free choice"" in 1969 and even preventing Papuans from taking their protests to the UN. 
West Papua's future is still grim with Indonesia's militia now recruiting violent anti-independence forces. I hope Mr Howard has the courage to show the same concern for justice as he did with East Timor. He might even reexplore the idea of a Melanesian federation including West Papua, Papua New Guinea and Bougainville, ethnically a much healthier destiny than Irian Jaya.

Perhaps Mr Carter does not realise that, in poll after poll, well over half the American public supports the common-sense legislation proposed by the Million Mom March. If Mr Carter would prefer to live in a place where gun owners make public policy in defiance of the expressed wishes of the majority, I suggest that he flip through your pages in search of a more congenial home. Perhaps Freetown or Kisangani would appeal to him.

Florida Mom ","The English abroad 
SIR-Tony Blair (""Merciful defeat"", June 24th) claims that football hooligans are not representative of the English national character (significantly he did not refer to the Scottish or Welsh, who must be grateful to him for once). Where else do xenophobic tabloids enjoy daily circulations of several million and regularly publish frankly racist articles directed for the most part at England's close neighbours? 
English football hooliganism is the extreme, physical demonstration of an English culture of prejudice which ranges from a general feeling of dislike and distrust of ""foreigners"" to the more excessive expressions of xenophobia found in the tabloid newspapers or in pub talk across England on any Saturday night. 
Saint Vincent des Bois, France MICHAEL GREEN 
Sir-You say that ""English fans' attempts to blame foreign policemen for their riots have become a tired refrain."" But the claim that over-zealous policing led to the abuse and arrest of many fans who were involved in nothing that could remotely be described as rioting deserves further investigation, rather than to be dismissed out of hand. 
That is not to deny that a small number of troublemakers need to be dealt with firmly, preferably in a way which prevents them getting anywhere near a football ground again. However, it is not yet a crime to be English or to visit a town where a football match is taking place.

Miller lite 
SIR-You conclude your obituary of Merton Miller June 10th) by revealing that, despite his belief in the efficiency of markets, he would occasionally take a flyer on a company's shares. There was another respect in which he tempered his economic beliefs. About ten years ago, I was sitting with him at a small dinner and the conversation turned to beer. He revealed that though he was opposed to all government regulation he would make an exception for the German beer-purity laws. Cambridge, Massachusetts ADAM JARED APT 
Pond life 
SIR-You describe Peter Pond, the first European to encounter the Alberta tar sands, as a British explorer (""Pay dirt"", June 17th). Indeed most of western Canada was first mapped and explored by young Scottish fur traders such as Alexander Mackenzie and Simon Fraser, after whom some major north-west waterways are named. Like those of Mackenzie, Fraser and others, Pond's explorations were also driven by the fur trade, and the search for the mythical ""North-West Passage"". 
However, Pond was not British but a New England Yankee, noted for his fierce competitive spirit and shrewd trading abilities. Perhaps this explains (with a few other intervening bits of history) why even today it is principally American companies that have developed and derived benefit from the Alberta tar sands.

Online regulation 
SIR-I was surprised to see you call for an international regulator for e-commerce (""Regulating the Internet"", June 10th). Protection of intellectual property and taxation are traditionally the domain of governments and given the global nature of the Internet, governments must develop a co-ordinated approach to prevent a patchwork of potentially inconsistent rules. Business worldwide does not believe that privacy and consumer protection fall into the same category as intellectual property and taxation.

2000-06-24,https://www-proquest-com.proxy.uchicago.edu/abicomplete/docview/224046928/fulltext/EFFBEBCAF19F4C54PQ/10?accountid=14657,"Japan is changing rapidly, for better and worse. Its politics remains eternally the same. How long can that last? 
WALK up Dogenzaka slope in the Shibuya shopping district of inner Tokyo, and you would not know that there has been a recession in Japan. The young and not-soyoung spill out of the neon-bright stores with their designer-label shopping bags, gulp latte at Starbucks, download their email on i-mode cell-phones dangling from their necks, and chatter incessantly about cool new things to do, see and buy. 
On the surface, Japan looks as prosperous, content and law-abiding as ever, and much more relaxed as well. Sararimen strap-hanging their way to work these days are as likely to wear a sports jacket as the once-ubiquitous blue suit and tie (the tie pinned, military-style, to a starched white shirt). Below the surface, however, and away from the bright city lights, cracks have begun to snake their way through the corporate masonry. 
Last Sunday's election showed signs of a deep, and general, unease. Because the weather was miserable, the turnout was very low by Japanese standards. Even so, the 62% of voters who managed to emerge from their futons still gave Yoshiro Mori's ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) and its two small coalition partners a serious pummelling. Although the coalition managed to hang on to power and preserve a working majority, the LDr lost its own majority in the newly slimmed-down lower house of the Diet. It ended up with 233 seats, down from 271. 
It was not just that voters were annoyed with Mr Mori, who took over as prime minister on April 5th after his predecessor, Keizo Obuchi, suffered a stroke. Mr Mori had, it is true, made numerous gaffes on taking office, including the remark that Japan was ""a divine country with the emperor at the centre"". But almost half of Japan's loom eligible voters do not support any particular party these days. Their frustration is with the whole system, and with the LDp as the system's entrenched representative. There is a widespread feeling that the country is in dire need of a whole range of social as well as economic reforms, but that the govemment-bound by its powerful ties to special interests-is incapable of doing the job. 
Anyone younger than 50 in Japan grew up in an era when incomes were doubling every decade. But the 1990s were a different story. In 1990-91 the bubble economy collapsed, ushering in stagnation that lasted a decade: Japan's deepest and longest slump in more than 50 years. The recession hit family incomes especially hard. Bonuses, if paid at all, have been slashed;wage rises are out of the question; overtime is a thing of the past. 
Worst of all, loyalty to the company-the bedrock upon which Japan Inc was built-is no longer being rewarded. Older workers, who are costlier because of Japan's seniority pay system, are being told unceremoniously to leave. Unemployment, barely heard of a decade ago, has hit an official 5% (measured properly, it is at least 7%), and is set to climb still further, even as the Japanese economy begins its slow recovery. The unemployed can be seen in the parks; some live in neat cardboard boxes, beside small gardens which They carefully tend to fill up the hours. 
According to opinion polls, one family in eight has a member who has recently been made redundant (risutora, or ""restructured"", in the bitter workers' jargon), or expects to be made so shortly. One in five youngsters looking for a first job have been unable to find one. Meanwhile, the Bank of Japan's policy of zero interest rates has mercilessly squeezed the savings of a rapidly ageing population. Little wonder that suicides have risen by 53% since 1991. 
Crime, too, has risen sharply, especially among the young. Not since the 1950s have Japanese city centres been places to avoid after dark; but now gangs of young thugs go in search of easy targets, particularly drunken sararimen. Meanwhile, schoolgirl prostitution has become one of the biggest headaches for the police. If only for the vicarious thrill, one in three girls of high-school age admits to having dialled one of the ""telephone clubs"" that match callers with men willing to pay for sex. 
In Japanese classrooms (once famous for the cheerful obedience of the children), incidents of teachers being threatened with knives or beaten with baseball bats have become so common that they are no longer front-page news. Instead, reporters find bloodier incidents to cover. There are now more hours of bloody mayhem every week on Japan's Tv screens than on America's. And for all these signs of breakdown, economic, moral or social, voters naturally blame the party that has been so long in power. 
The lone persimmon tree 
Apart from a ten-month blip in 1993-94, the Lne has governed Japan continuously since it was formed in 1955 by a merger of two conservative parties. Its role then was to counter the surging influence of Japan's left-wing parties; there was a real fear, though it seems strange now, that Marxism might take the country over. Before long, however, the Lnr had declared a truce with the Japan Socialist Party, and both sides set about carving up the benefits of the economic miracle that was gathering pace. 
With order-books full as exports boomed and with skilled labour starting to run short, the companies co-opted the trade unions by offering training, health care and a job for life. Within a few years, Japan's once belligerent unions had been broken up and transformed into thousands of small company associations that became, in effect, part of the management. From that moment, the ideological left lost its influence in Japan. Unrestrained, the LDP turned its attention to promoting the interests of its three main groups of supporters: farmers, small shopkeepers and the construction industry. 
After the samurai, farmers were the most privileged group in Japan's old feudal hierarchy. And the LDP has protected them as thoroughly as any feudal lord. The party fought tooth and nail to keep Virginia tobacco out of Japan, so that off budget subsidies could be fed to tobacco-growing farmers from Japan Tobacco, the governmentowned cigarette monopoly. Everywhere else in the world where Virginia tobacco competes freely, it gets around 30% of the market. in Japan, the LDP has managed to keep its share to no more than 3%. 
Rice-growers have been treated even more kindly. For years, foreign rice was banned in Japan, save for an annual 14,000 tonnes of Thai rice needed by Okinawan brewers for a local tipple. But in 1992, when, under the Uruguay Round of world trade negotiations, all non-tariff barriers were to be replaced by measurable tariffs, the LDP refused to comply. It took six years to persuade Japan to accept tariffs on foreign rice, rather than an outright ban. And even then the Lnr had the last word. It set the tariff at Y351 ($2.70) per kilogramme, three-and-a-half times the price of American rice. 
Yet rice is no longer Japan's staple food. Wheat, in the form of bread and noodles, provides the bulk of people's calories these days. With the government's stockpiling granaries full to the brim, Japanese farmers have long been paid not to produce the stuff. In the lowlands of Japan, terraced paddy fields have become a rare sight. Farmers drain their fields and plant fruit or vegetables instead. Increasingly, however, they are letting the land lie untended. Thanks to the LDP, Japanese farmers need do no more to collect their subsidies each year than plant a lone persimmon tree. 
Year after year, the ruling party managed to convince ordinary citizens that high prices were in their own best interests. Consumers were told that, yes, prices might be a little higher than elsewhere, but they ensured reliable supplies of food, maintained the quality of Japanese goods and, of course, helped to keep everyone fully employed. No matter that Japanese housewives paid up to eight times the American price for rice, five times the American price for beef, fruit and processed food, and three to four times as much for travel, clothing and telephone calls. 
It could not go on. Japan's demographics, as the LnP has known for years, were working remorselessly against the party's machines. In short, the party's hard-ore supporters in the countryside were dying of old age. Back in the mid-1960s, one in three Japanese lived in a household of farmers. By 1995, only one in 20 was part of a family that worked the land. Many had moved with the children into the cities; many more had been interred in the local temple's ground. Thanks to gerrymandering and migration, the rural constituencies went on for years enjoying three times the voting clout of their urban counterparts. But nature worked inexorably: one way or another, between the mid-1960s and the mid-1990s, the LDP lost some 20m supporters. 
Quintessence of dust 
Japan's once-vast network of small retailers has shrivelled, too. Twenty years ago, neighbourhood streets were lined with poky stores that stacked up their goods on the pavement for all to see. Inside, the obaasan (grandmother) would quickly take a duster to anything the customer asked to see. With discounting unheard of and inventories paid for by the producer, goods cost the shopkeeper nothing to keep on the shelves. So they gathered dust while waiting for a customer to pay the full price. 
For years, these shops have been dying off or selling out. The retail law that had long protected them from the big discount chains was watered down in the early 1990s under pressure from American trade officials, who wanted to help Toys ""R"" Us gain a foothold in Japan. The result is that convenience stores operated by Seven-Eleven, FamilyMart, Lawsons, Circle x and other national chains have replaced most of the little shops-which, as well as selling dog-eared items, also campaigned vigorously for the LDP. 
The LDP has gone out of its way to preserve its one remaining big prop, the 6m workers in the construction industry. The banks have been arm-twisted into forgiving billions of yen owed by insolvent building firms, and the government has dumped an extra ono trillion of taxpayers' money into the struggling economy over the past eight years-mostly as public-works projects. 
Some Y1 trillion of that money went on the Akashi Kaikyo bridge, between Kobe and Awaji island in Osaka Bay. When the bridge opened a few years ago, officials announced that they expected 37,000 cars a day to use it. In the same breath, they cheerfully admitted that, before the bridge was built, only 100-200 cars made the crossing each day by ferry. Now that the tourist novelty has worn off, less than a tenth of the bridge's expected traffic shows up on a typical weekday. And even with largesse like this, debt-ridden building firms continue to fall like flies. 
Despite the erosion of its support, the Lnp has proved unable to shift its focus away from producers and towards consumers. This myopia did not matter as long as the economy continued to expand and corporate profits trickled down even to the lowliest of workers. But the recession that has gripped Japan for the better part of a decade has forced employers to tear up the ""social compact"" they had with the government. 
Under this informal arrangement, companies were protected from over-aggressive competition at home by a careful balance of government regulation and licensing, while being allowed to charge high prices and shelter their profits from excessive taxation. In exchange, they undertook to hire more employees than they needed and not to fire them when times got hard. For their part, employees accepted the long hours, modest pay and poor conditions because the company promised to look after them, if not for life, at least for a good number of years. 
It is this part of the agreement that has collapsed. Since 1997, up to im people a year have been ""restructured"" out of their jobs-ie, forced to quit against their wishes. Bosses rely heavily on peer pressure, bullying and other tricks to force their unwanted workers to leave. The result is deepening social division and bitterness, both inside and outside the office. And redundancies are expected to continue at this rate for three or four more years, until Japanese companies have finally reduced their inflated headcounts to globally competitive levels. 
Dependent old, profligate young 
None of this anxiety was reflected in the parties' campaign statements. None offered specific ideas as.to how to modernise the economy; how to create a million new jobs a year; how to cap surging health costs while improving the quality of care; how to make it easier for mothers to work; and, above all, how to cope with the country's rapidly ageing population, including plugging the gaping holes in the pension schemes. 
The Japanese, better educated and wider-read than their western counterparts, are well aware of the problems in store. Demographers have often told them that the population will hit a peak of 128m (up from today's 127m) in 2007s, and will then begin to decline quite quickly. Less crowded cities might seem attractive, but not if they are full of old people with few youngsters to do the jobs and keep the services working. Today, there are four workers in Japan to support every elderly dependant. By 2025, there will be only 2.2 workers for every pensioner. 
The Japanese want to know what impact all this will have on their own pensions, as well as on their lives and the lives of their children. The ""national burden"" (taxes plus welfare costs as a proportion of cDr) is currently 36%-much the same as in America, but less than the European average. By 2025, if nothing is done, the Japanese figure will have soared to over 60%. 
Yet doing nothing is precisely what voters have come to expect of their political leaders. And when politicians make specific proposals, they tend to reveal just how out of touch they are. Earlier this year, for example, the government announced more public holidays so that people could give the economy a boost by taking trips and going shopping. Young women, however, are already shopping in unbridled fashion, and they have been the saving of Japan. There are now 7m working women in their teens and aos; they are better educated, more widely travelled and more ready to experiment than Japan's young men; and, since they live at home and pay little in the way of rent and taxes, they have on average more than Y150,000 ($1,400) a month to blow on clothes, cosmetics, music, holidays and dining out. 
These women are a revelation to Japan. They look different: having been brought up on cereals and dairy products instead of the rice and pickles of the generation before, they are a good deal taller than their mothers, and rarely have the bow legs that came from sitting on their calves instead of on a chair. And they are older when they marry: around 27. Because these young women stay out of the marriage pool much longer than their mothers did, fertility rates have plummeted in Japan to fewer than 1.4 children for each woman, down from more than 2.1 in 1970. This preference for the good life rather than motherhood is the reason why the Japanese population is set to crash-and why the pensions system needs retooling. 
The third opening 
Twice before, Japan has remade itself from top to bottom. In 1868, after Commander Perry's gunboats had entered Tokyo Bay and demanded the right to trade, Japan ended its three centuries of self imposed isolation, threw out its military government, restored the Meiji emperor, industrialised frantically and caught up with the West within 3o years. 
Then, after the surrender in 1945, Japan jettisoned all the vestiges of its militaristic past and built a modem democracy that laid the foundations for its emergence as an economic superpower 30 years later. Many of Japan's social, business and economic norms today are relics from that era. 
That is the nub of the problem. The system that Japan perfected from the i95os onward was designed for an industrial society in its early stages of economic development. It is totally unsuited to a post-industrial world. Thus, Japanese schools all teach virtually the same curricula, all in the same way, all at the same time. Their job, in effect, is to produce cannon-fodder for the manufacturing sector, not oddball characters who can dream up whole new industries. 
The Pokemon cards and Nintendo games that have overrun the world are mere hints of the creativity that could be unleashed in Japan. They have escaped despite the system. In a post-industrial world that is driven more than ever by iconoclasts drawn from the cleverest 25% of a country's population, Japan is at a serious disadvantage. And what goes for Japanese education applies equally to the country's 1950s-style management, administration and politics. 
Outsiders often worry that, being relatively new, Japanese democracy may be only skin-deep. Not so. Most of the democratic institutions that were restored during the post-war occupation-universal suf frage, the parliamentary system, a free and varied press, a modem legal system-were not thrust on an unwilling people but demanded by the Japanese themselves. If anything, the problem with Japan today is that its democratic institutions are almost too powerful and not flexible enough to deal with changing times. 
The Japanese people sense that the time has come for a ""third opening""-the introduction of a wholly new way of doing things comparable to the Meiji restoration or General MacArthur's post-war reforms. What goes unmentioned, however, is that the Meiji restoration destroyed the livelihoods of a ruling class of 1.5m samurai; and that the post-war reforms introduced by the Allied powers drove 200,000 wartime leaders from office. In both cases, the structure of governance was changed dramatically. 
That is why Japan's political parties want nothing to do with reform. It is also the reason why Japanese voters are becoming increasingly independent, and ready to punish those who would try to turn back (or stop) the clock. Mr Mori's new administration is expected to be short-lived. What follows for the LDP and its coalition partners is anyone's guess. Some time in the near future, there is going to be serious political deadlock in Japan. But out of that will come, doubtless with pain and struggle, the ""third opening"" of Japan that will pitch the country into the brave new post-industrial world. ","Japan is changing rapidly , for better and worse . Its politics remains eternally the same . How long can that last ? 
 WALK up Dogenzaka slope in the Shibuya shopping district of inner Tokyo , and you would not know that there has been a recession in Japan . The young and not - soyoung spill out of the neon - bright stores with their designer - label shopping bags , gulp latte at Starbucks , download their email on i - mode cell - phones dangling from their necks , and chatter incessantly about cool new things to do , see and buy . 
 On the surface , Japan looks as prosperous , content and law - abiding as ever , and much more relaxed as well . Sararimen strap - hanging their way to work these days are as likely to wear a sports jacket as the once - ubiquitous blue suit and tie ( the tie pinned , military - style , to a starched white shirt ) . Below the surface , however , and away from the bright city lights , cracks have begun to snake their way through the corporate masonry . 
 Last Sunday 's election showed signs of a deep , and general , unease . Because the weather was miserable , the turnout was very low by Japanese standards . Even so , the 62 % of voters who managed to emerge from their futons still gave Keizo Obuchi's ruling Liberal Democratic Party ( LDP ) and its two small coalition partners a serious pummelling . Although the coalition managed to hang on to power and preserve a working majority , the LDr lost its own majority in the newly slimmed - down lower house of the Diet . It ended up with 233 seats , down from 271 . 
 It was not just that voters were annoyed with Keizo Obuchi's . Keizo Obuchi had , it is true , made numerous gaffes on taking office , including the remark that Japan was "" a divine country with the emperor at the centre "" . But almost half of Japan 's loom eligible voters do not support any particular party these days . Their frustration is with the whole system , and with the LDp as the system 's entrenched representative . There is a widespread feeling that the country is in dire need of a whole range of social as well as economic reforms , but that the govemment - bound by its powerful ties to special interests - is incapable of doing the job . 
 Anyone younger than 50 in Japan grew up in an era when incomes were doubling every decade . But the 1990s were a different story . In 1990 - 91 the bubble economy collapsed , ushering in stagnation that lasted a decade : Japan 's deepest and longest slump in more than 50 years . The recession hit family incomes especially hard . Bonuses , if paid at all , have been slashed;wage rises are out of the question ; overtime is a thing of the past . 
 Worst of all , loyalty to the company - the bedrock upon which Japan Inc was built - is no longer being rewarded . Older workers , who are costlier because of Japan 's seniority pay system , are being told unceremoniously to leave . Unemployment , barely heard of a decade ago , has hit an official 5 % ( measured properly , it is at least 7 % ) , and is set to climb still further , even as the Japanese economy begins its slow recovery . The unemployed can be seen in the parks ; some live in neat cardboard boxes , beside small gardens which They carefully tend to fill up the hours . 
 According to opinion polls , one family in eight has a member who has recently been made redundant ( risutora , or "" restructured "" , in the bitter workers ' jargon ) , or expects to be made so shortly . One in five youngsters looking for a first job have been unable to find one . Meanwhile , the Bank of Japan 's policy of zero interest rates has mercilessly squeezed the savings of a rapidly ageing population . Little wonder that suicides have risen by 53 % since 1991 . 
 Crime , too , has risen sharply , especially among the young . Not since the 1950s have Japanese city centres been places to avoid after dark ; but now gangs of young thugs go in search of easy targets , particularly drunken sararimen . Meanwhile , schoolgirl prostitution has become one of the biggest headaches for the police . If only for the vicarious thrill , one in three girls of high - school age admits to having dialled one of the "" telephone clubs "" that match callers with men willing to pay for sex . 
 In Japanese classrooms ( once famous for the cheerful obedience of the children ) , incidents of teachers being threatened with knives or beaten with baseball bats have become so common that they are no longer front - page news . Instead , reporters find bloodier incidents to cover . There are now more hours of bloody mayhem every week on Japan 's Tv screens than on America 's . And for all these signs of breakdown , economic , moral or social , voters naturally blame the party that has been so long in power . 
 The lone persimmon tree 
 Apart from a ten - month blip in 1993 - 94 , the Lne has governed Japan continuously since it was formed in 1955 by a merger of two conservative parties . Its role then was to counter the surging influence of Japan 's left - wing parties ; there was a real fear , though it seems strange now , that Marxism might take the country over . Before long , however , the Lnr had declared a truce with the Japan Socialist Party , and both sides set about carving up the benefits of the economic miracle that was gathering pace . 
 With order - books full as exports boomed and with skilled labour starting to run short , the companies co - opted the trade unions by offering training , health care and a job for life . Within a few years , Japan 's once belligerent unions had been broken up and transformed into thousands of small company associations that became , in effect , part of the management . From that moment , the ideological left lost its influence in Japan . Unrestrained , the LDP turned its attention to promoting the interests of its three main groups of supporters : farmers , small shopkeepers and the construction industry . 
 After the samurai , farmers were the most privileged group in Japan 's old feudal hierarchy . And the LDP has protected them as thoroughly as any feudal lord . The party fought tooth and nail to keep Virginia tobacco out of Japan , so that off budget subsidies could be fed to tobacco - growing farmers from Japan Tobacco , the governmentowned cigarette monopoly . Everywhere else in the world where Virginia tobacco competes freely , it gets around 30 % of the market . in Japan , the LDP has managed to keep its share to no more than 3 % . 
 Rice - growers have been treated even more kindly . For years , foreign rice was banned in Japan , save for an annual 14,000 tonnes of Thai rice needed by Okinawan brewers for a local tipple . But in 1992 , when , under the Uruguay Round of world trade negotiations , all non - tariff barriers were to be replaced by measurable tariffs , the LDP refused to comply . It took six years to persuade Japan to accept tariffs on foreign rice , rather than an outright ban . And even then the Lnr had the last word . It set the tariff at Y351 ( $ 2.70 ) per kilogramme , three - and - a - half times the price of American rice . 
 Yet rice is no longer Japan 's staple food . Wheat , in the form of bread and noodles , provides the bulk of people 's calories these days . With the government 's stockpiling granaries full to the brim , Japanese farmers have long been paid not to produce the stuff . In the lowlands of Japan , terraced paddy fields have become a rare sight . Farmers drain their fields and plant fruit or vegetables instead . Increasingly , however , they are letting the land lie untended . Thanks to the LDP , Japanese farmers need do no more to collect their subsidies each year than plant a lone persimmon tree . 
 Year after year , the ruling party managed to convince ordinary citizens that high prices were in their own best interests . Consumers were told that , yes , prices might be a little higher than elsewhere , but they ensured reliable supplies of food , maintained the quality of Japanese goods and , of course , helped to keep everyone fully employed . No matter that Japanese housewives paid up to eight times the American price for rice , five times the American price for beef , fruit and processed food , and three to four times as much for travel , clothing and telephone calls . 
 It could not go on . Japan 's demographics , as the LnP has known for years , were working remorselessly against the party 's machines . In short , the party 's hard - ore supporters in the countryside were dying of old age . Back in the mid-1960s , one in three Japanese lived in a household of farmers . By 1995 , only one in 20 was part of a family that worked the land . Many had moved with the children into the cities ; many more had been interred in the local temple 's ground . Thanks to gerrymandering and migration , the rural constituencies went on for years enjoying three times the voting clout of their urban counterparts . But nature worked inexorably : one way or another , between the mid-1960s and the mid-1990s , the LDP lost some 20 m supporters . 
 Quintessence of dust 
 Japan 's once - vast network of small retailers has shrivelled , too . Twenty years ago , neighbourhood streets were lined with poky stores that stacked up their goods on the pavement for all to see . Inside , the obaasan ( grandmother ) would quickly take a duster to anything the customer asked to see . With discounting unheard of and inventories paid for by the producer , goods cost the shopkeeper nothing to keep on the shelves . So they gathered dust while waiting for a customer to pay the full price . 
 For years , these shops have been dying off or selling out . The retail law that had long protected them from the big discount chains was watered down in the early 1990s under pressure from American trade officials , who wanted to help Toys "" R "" Us gain a foothold in Japan . The result is that convenience stores operated by Seven - Eleven , FamilyMart , Lawsons , Circle x and other national chains have replaced most of the little shops - which , as well as selling dog - eared items , also campaigned vigorously for the LDP . 
 The LDP has gone out of its way to preserve its one remaining big prop , the 6 m workers in the construction industry . The banks have been arm - twisted into forgiving billions of yen owed by insolvent building firms , and the government has dumped an extra ono trillion of taxpayers ' money into the struggling economy over the past eight years - mostly as public - works projects . 
 Some Y1 trillion of that money went on the Akashi Kaikyo bridge , between Kobe and Awaji island in Osaka Bay . When the bridge opened a few years ago , officials announced that they expected 37,000 cars a day to use it . In the same breath , they cheerfully admitted that , before the bridge was built , only 100 - 200 cars made the crossing each day by ferry . Now that the tourist novelty has worn off , less than a tenth of the bridge 's expected traffic shows up on a typical weekday . And even with largesse like this , debt - ridden building firms continue to fall like flies . 
 Despite the erosion of its support , the Lnp has proved unable to shift its focus away from producers and towards consumers . This myopia did not matter as long as the economy continued to expand and corporate profits trickled down even to the lowliest of workers . But the recession that has gripped Japan for the better part of a decade has forced employers to tear up the "" social compact "" they had with the government . 
 Under this informal arrangement , companies were protected from over - aggressive competition at home by a careful balance of government regulation and licensing , while being allowed to charge high prices and shelter their profits from excessive taxation . In exchange , they undertook to hire more employees than they needed and not to fire them when times got hard . For their part , employees accepted the long hours , modest pay and poor conditions because the company promised to look after them , if not for life , at least for a good number of years .

DURING his almost eight-year stint in the White House, Bill Clinton has had to remember the names of seven different prime ministers of Japan. Before leaving of fice next January, the American president could be welcoming an eighth. The biggest impression given by Japan's new cabinet, which was announced on July qth, is that it is strictly a temporary affair. A whole new government line-up, including the possible replacement of Yoshiro Mori, who became prime minister in April after his predecessor Keizo Obuchi had a stroke, is now expected within five months; perhaps even less. 
Mr Mori's leadership was given only grudging acceptance in the general election on June 25th, which saw the ruling Liberal Democratic Party (r.Dr) lose its majority but remain the largest party in the important lower house of the Diet (parliament). Even so, opinion polls taken since then suggest that astonishingly three out of four Japanese have no expectations whatsoever for Mr Mori's coalition government. More than ever, the r.ne is now hostage to its two main, but small, coalition allies, the Buddhistbacked New Komeito and the dwindling Conservative Party. Two out of three people in Japan, the polls suggest, would like to see the gaffe-prone Mr Mori go. 
Apart from trying to keep the economy's tentative recovery on track, Mr Mori's only real task is to see Japan safely through the summit meeting of the Group of Seven countries plus Russia in Okinawa later this month. Hence the diplomatic experience of Yohei Kono was required, which is the main reason he was kept on as foreign minister. Likewise the octogenarian Kiichi Miyazawa has remained as finance minister,despite expressing a strong desire to leave the government. Both men are considered to have a safe pair of hands and are well regarded by Japan's G7 partners. 
Taichi Sakaiya, another minister with international credibility who had asked to be excused, agreed reluctantly to stay as head of the Economic Planning Agency. Mr Sakaiya, a former bureaucrat turned author, has won plenty of respect for refusing to fudge the lacklustre GAP figures as much as his predecessors did. Neither Mr Miyazawa nor Mr Sakaiya would have agreed to remain in the cabinet for another term if they had thought it was going to last for any length of time. 
Hangovers from the previous cabinet aside, most of Mr Mori's new ministers are time-servers from the ruling party who have been appointed more for their loyalty than their talent. As a result, the new cabinet's average age is the highest since 1990. The LDP's four main factions could easily have fielded more suitable candidates, but opted not to waste their best men on what they clearly see as only an interim administration. 
As delighted as they were to be told that the chance had finally come for a ministerial post, most of the new cabinet members were adamant about the one job they would not take: the construction portfolio. This is normally a plum post for any up-and-coming LDP leader, bringing with it lots of favours that will later be returned by construction firms grateful for the government's generous spending on public works. 
Unfortunately, though, that now looks like a dangerous job. Yet another bribery scandal has emerged within the Lne. Eiichi Nakao, a former construction minister, was arrested on June 30th on suspicion of receiving Y30m ($285,000) in kickbacks from a construction firm called Wakachiku in return for public works contracts. On July 3rd, the Tokyo public prosecutor's office raided the construction ministry, searching offices and confiscating documents, as the scandal spread and other informants chipped in. 
Initially, the LDP's secretary-general, Hiromu Nonaka, and the new chief cabinet secretary, Hidenao Nakagawa, had allocated the powerful construction post to Tadamori Oshima. But when he balked and no other takers could be found within the LDr itself, the job was offered to Chikage Ogi, the 67year-old leader of the New Liberal Party. Mrs Ogi, a former actress in a musical troupe, was supposed to get the education post. ""Why me?"" she fumed when informed that instead she was being given construction. Because everyone else, she was told, feared the mounting media scrutiny of their connections to the construction industry. 
How far the LDP's latest scandal will reach is still a matter for speculation. Some believe it could grow more troublesome and force Mr Mori to take responsibility and resign, in much the same way as the late Noboru Takeshita was forced out of office a decade ago over the Recruit ""shares-forfavours"" scandal. One way or another, Mr Mori is in for a rough time when the Diet convenes this autumn. The opposition demands that key witnesses in the Wakachiku scandal are made to testify before the Diet. 
But if the LDP's latest scandal does not bring down the present government first, then something else surely will. The most likely cause is a package of administrative reforms that is set to go into effect on January ist 2001. In a bid to streamline Japan's cumbersome government administration, the present 21 ministries and agencies are to be lumped together to form is super-ministries plus a beefed up cabinet office. In the process, the number of cabinet posts will be trimmed from 19 to a dozen or so. The easiest way to do that will be with a reshuffle after the budget has been compiled in December. 
The name that the outgoing President Clinton might then have to conjure with could be Mr Kono, providing the foreign minister can be persuaded to stay on even longer, or Koichi Kato, a former general secretary of the party who was relegated to the sidelines by Mr Obuchi after having challenged him for the leadership. Neither would be a bad choice. Both are competent politicians and, with any luck, could at least be relied upon to end the embarrassment that the Japanese evidently feel about their current leadership.

 As delighted as they were to be told that the chance had finally come for a ministerial post , most of the new cabinet members were adamant about the one job they would not take : the construction portfolio . This is normally a plum post for any up - and - coming LDP leader , bringing with it lots of favours that will later be returned by construction firms grateful for the government 's generous spending on public works . 
 Unfortunately , though , that now looks like a dangerous job . Yet another bribery scandal has emerged within the Lne . Eiichi Nakao , a former construction minister , was arrested on June 30th on suspicion of receiving Y30 m ( $ 285,000 ) in kickbacks from a construction firm called Wakachiku in return for public works contracts . On July 3rd , the Tokyo public prosecutor 's office raided the construction ministry , searching offices and confiscating documents , as the scandal spread and other informants chipped in . 
 Initially , the LDP 's secretary - general , Hiromu Nonaka , and the new chief cabinet secretary , Hidenao Nakagawa , had allocated the powerful construction post to Tadamori Oshima . But when he balked and no other takers could be found within the LDr itself , the job was offered to Chikage Ogi , the 67year - old leader of the New Liberal Party . Mrs Ogi , a former actress in a musical troupe , was supposed to get the education post . "" Why me ? "" she fumed when informed that instead she was being given construction . Because everyone else , she was told , feared the mounting media scrutiny of their connections to the construction industry . 
 How far the LDP 's latest scandal will reach is still a matter for speculation . Some believe it could grow more troublesome and force Keizo Obuchi to take responsibility and resign , in much the same way as the late Noboru Takeshita was forced out of office a decade ago over the Recruit "" shares - forfavours "" scandal . One way or another , Keizo Obuchi is in for a rough time when the Diet convenes this autumn . The opposition demands that key witnesses in the Wakachiku scandal are made to testify before the Diet . 
 But if the LDP 's latest scandal does not bring down the present government first , then something else surely will . The most likely cause is a package of administrative reforms that is set to go into effect on January ist 2001 . In a bid to streamline Japan 's cumbersome government administration , the present 21 ministries and agencies are to be lumped together to form is super - ministries plus a beefed up cabinet office . In the process , the number of cabinet posts will be trimmed from 19 to a dozen or so . The easiest way to do that will be with a reshuffle after the budget has been compiled in December . 
 The name that the outgoing President Clinton might then have to conjure with could be Mr Kono , providing the foreign minister can be persuaded to stay on even longer , or Koichi Kato , a former general secretary of the party who was relegated to the sidelines by Mr Obuchi after having challenged him for the leadership . Neither would be a bad choice . Both are competent politicians and , with any luck , could at least be relied upon to end the embarrassment that the Japanese evidently feel about their current leadership .",740,Japan,A29-8200,POST TERM,True,"Yoshiro Mori , who became prime minister in April after his predecessor Keizo Obuchi had a stroke",11,True

Not since the upper-house elections in 1998 has Koichi Kato held office in the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP), which has dominated Japanese politics almost since its birth in 1955. Mr Kato's resignation in the summer of 1998 as the party's secretary-general, along with the prime minister of the time, Ryutaro Hashimoto, brought to a limp end a historic programme of reforms which, on paper at least, promised revolution. 
So far, Mr Kato has been denied a second chance, as he and his supporters in the LDP'S ""anti-mainstream"" have gently drifted ever farther from the currents of party power. But opportunity has begun to beckon again. The economy is on the mend, and the free-spending policies that replaced reform as recession struck look increasingly to have run their course. According to recent opinion polls, only one voter in 20 now supports the government's economic policies. Sooner or later Yoshiro Mori, who lacks the personal charm of his predecessor, Keizo Obuchi, will step down as prime minister. Mr Kato's supporters make no bones of the fact that they want their man to succeed him. 
The Hashimoto reforms that Mr Kato championed so eloquently now look over-- ambitious. The six reforms-of the bureaucracy, the public finances, the economy, banking, social security and education-pitted the LDP's leaders against the entrenched interests of their own party. Mr Kato wanted nothing less than to turn Japan upside down. Bureaucratic reform would break the state's power over the economy. Economic deregulation would strengthen market forces. A new politics would return power to the politicians. Economic and political reform were two sides of the same coin, thought Mr Kato: Japan had to put more trust in its own people to run things, and less in its governing elite. But the intricate institutional arrangements that bind businessmen, politicians and bureaucrats together in Japan's well-organised polity made such a reform programme hard work. 
Mr Kato now says that the Japanese people themselves were not ready for ""radical spiritual change"". State-led growth may have stifled economic choice. But it also offered the comfort of government protection. The result of reform was confusion and alarm at the sudden responsibilities of the marketplace, and a yearning to turn the clock back. The otherwise unpopular Mr Mori appeals to this mood, with his nostalgia for pre-war society. 
One thing Mr Kato has now learned is to dress his liberalism in conservative colours. Reform has become a dirty word in Japan, bringing to mind the pain of financial crisis, job losses and bankruptcies. In theory, he could took outside the LDP to push his agenda, taking the party's proreformers with him. But other politicians have trodden this path and failed. Radical reform from within the Lnr will fail too, Mr Kato says, and for the same reason: it runs against the thinking of the local community leaders who form the bedrock of LDP support. If he is to succeed, Mr Kato reckons, he must win the trust of these local leaders. That suggests a more cautious programme-one that preserves the direction of reform but tempers the speed. 
Mr Kato knows he cannot provoke a crisis. If he did, he would be vulnerable to charges of party disloyalty. Neither, though,can he afford to wait for ever. At 61, he will soon be eligible to become speaker of the house, an honorary position that would mark the end of his ambitions. Probably, he will wait until after next summer's upper-house elections. If the LDP does badly, Mr Mori will have to resign, clearing the way for Mr Kato to make a bid for the party leadership next autumn. 
Mr Kato does not yet have enough support within the parliamentary party to claim the top job. Most of the one's factions are at best ambivalent towards his ambitions. Besides his own faction, the second-biggest (see chart), he can count on the support of only one other, that led by Taku Yamasaki. To seize power, he must win over Mr Hashimoto's faction, the powerful keiseikai. 
Mr Hashimoto himself is a friend, but he is boss of the keiseikai in name only. The real kingpin is Mikio Aoki, with whom Mr Kato enjoys much cooler relations. To warm things up, Mr Kato has recently supported Mr Aoki's push to change the upper-house electoral system. But he must be equally careful not to cede too much to Mr Aoki, lest, in familiar Japanese fashion, he becomes a puppet whose strings are pulled from behind the scenes. 
Yet Mr Kato does have one or two useful qualities. Like a Japanese Al Gore, he may lack charisma. But he is a forceful debater and powerful thinker, equally at ease with Japanese and western elites. In contrast, it is hard to put a finger on what, if anything, Mr Aoki stands for beyond his personal advancement and the welfare of his faction. He simply does not measure up to Mr Kato, so it is hard to see how he might control him. ""For the first time in a decade, we could have a prime minister who is his own man,"" says Takao Toshikawa of Tokyo InsideLine, a newsletter. The end result may fall short of the revolution Mr Kato used to like talking about. But at least on this occasion he may be able to carry the rest of Japan with him.

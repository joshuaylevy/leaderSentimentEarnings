TO UNDERSTAND Austria, visit the Karl-Marx-Hof. This vast municipal housing complex in Vienna is still riddled with bullet holes--not from fighting between Russians and Germans in 1945, but from a little-known civil war in 1934, when Austrian leftists and conservatives took up arms against each other. After the second world war, the country adopted a political system designed to prevent this from ever happening again: the Social Democrats (SPO) and the Christian Democrats (OVP) would rule together and divvy up public offices under a system known as Proporz. 
For 43 of the past 72 years the two parties have run Austria jointly, in grand coalitions. Their networks politicise everything from school boards and business groups to social clubs and unions. The result is a uniquely corporatist country. 
Today, however, that system is breaking up. Other parties--first the far-right FPO, then the Greens, then the liberal NEOS--have challenged the old duopoly. Both the SPO and the OVP have lost members. Economic stress adds to the pressure. A decade ago Austrian unemployment was a little over half that of Germany; now it is 50% higher. On May 10th Reinhold Mitterlehner, the OVP vice-chancellor, resigned and brought down the dysfunctional SPO-led grand coalition. Elections will take place on October 15th. ""What is happening in this country?"" marvelled Profil, a news magazine: ""Austria is unrecognisable, and redefining itself breathtakingly fast."" 
At the heart of the drama is Sebastian Kurz, Austria's 30-year-old foreign minister, its most popular politician and the OVP's new candidate for chancellor. In one sense, he is a product of the old-fashioned associational system, having soared through his party's ranks as head of its youth organisation. He turned the youth wing from a stagnant backwater into a dynamic network of local groups, putting on parties, pub nights, bike rides and various other opportunities for teenagers and 20-somethings to get it on with one another. In 2013 his youthful, liberal base, centred on Vienna, propelled him to the post of foreign minister. He then won over the party's right-wingers by taking a tough stance on immigration. 
Yet Mr Kurz is also determined to break Austria's old political architecture. He accepted his party's crown only after its bosses had agreed to several demands. These include the freedom to transform the OVP into a list of candidates, pick names for that list, bypass its powerful state bosses and formal interest groups (known as Bunde) and set its policies. Having soared in the polls (see chart), he is now trying to persuade prominent figures in NEOS, the Greens and civil society to join his list. Though his manifesto is a closely-guarded secret, insiders hint at liberalisations of Austria's schools, labour market and transfer payments. ""Taking money in taxes and paying it straight back in subsidies is wrong,"" Mr Kurz argues. 
Christian Kern, the SPO leader and current chancellor, is more defensive of the old model: ""It made Austria strong"", he says. He suggests that Mr Kurz is more image than substance, and doubts whether he can escape the old OVP structures. But like his rival, Mr Kern is a businesslike type who reckons Austria's paternalist model is dying. ""In the past it ran from cradle to grave: you would spend your free time in the Alpine club, at work you would be a member of an SPO or OVP trade union, from the nurseries to the emergency services everything was parcelled up. These connections have dissolved dramatically."" Mr Kern's response is what he calls Plan A, a package of liberalising economic reforms and infrastructure investments. 
Will Mr Kern or Mr Kurz succeed in remaking the system? Critics accuse the former of being a game-player whose grand plans amount to little. And they accuse the latter of merely rebranding the OVP. (Important tests include whether he omits unimpressive OVP placeholders from his list, whether he can persuade his party to support gay marriage and whether he can stand up to the teachers' Bund in support of education reform.) Of the two, Mr Kurz is the most ambitious. 
But the real barrier will probably be that of coalition formation. Messrs Kurz and Stern may agree, largely, on what is wrong with Austria, but after ten years of grand coalition their parties hate each other. Both would like to form a government with NEOS and the Greens, but the numbers look unpromising. That leaves the FPO, with which both the OVP and SPO govern at state level and with which both are willing to form a federal government in October, well aware of the diplomatic opprobrium this would attract. 
Both of Austria's prospective leaders accept that the country's political system is breaking up. The problem is that, unless polls shift, whoever wins will probably be saddled with a government too weak to allow a thorough programme of reforms. Austrian society is evolving. But whether its politics can keep up is uncertain.

A MAN lumbers into a tattoo studio and brandishes a photo of Sebastian Kurz, the young leader of the conservative Austrian People's Party (OVP). Then the artist gets to work, eventually showing the man his back in a mirror. Etched onto it is a circle of faces of superannuated OVP grandees. The customer is furious: ""I wanted Kurz, not the OVP!"" he yells. ""What did you expect?"" comes the reply: ""Kurz is the OVP."" 
This popular TV advert by the right-wing Freedom Party of Austria (FPO) plays on enduring questions about the 31-year-old likely to become Austria's next chancellor. Mr Kurz was made foreign minister in 2013, two years after leaving university, and took over the stuffy, beleaguered OVP in May. He has restyled it as the ""Kurz List"" and propelled it from third to first place in polls ahead of the parliamentary election on October 15th. To his fans he is the Wunderwuzzi (whizz kid), a rare chance for national renewal. To his opponents he is a ruthless opportunist. 
His success rests on two factors. First, Austria's corporatist industrial and political model is creaking. Since 1945 the OVP and the Social Democrats (SPO) have been in government for 55 and 61 years respectively, usually (as now) in coalition with each other. Taxes are high, the state clientelistic and growth relatively sluggish. Second, the refugee crisis has pushed Austrian politics further to the right. In 2015 the country took in more people, proportionally, than Germany. That pushed the anti-immigrant FPO into first place in polls, where it remained until Mr Kurz emerged as candidate for chancellor this spring. 
He has succeeded by melding these facts into a new political identity. Mr Kurz pushed to close the migration route through the Balkans (as foreign minister) and imposed tough measures such as a burqa ban (as minister for integration). He has also restyled his party as a force for openness: bringing in candidates from outside politics; promoting a ""glass [transparent] state""; tax cuts; and a war on red tape and vested interests. The rebranded OVP, now in turquoise rather than its traditional black, is the most popular party even among 14- to 29-year-olds. 
It has been a vicious campaign. The OVP and the SPO have hurled accusations at each other, starting with the claim that a consultant working for the Social Democrats set up Facebook pages with xenophobic and anti-Semitic attacks on Mr Kurz. This has benefited the FPO, which has run a strong campaign marked by catchy advertising (like the tattoo clip) and uncharacteristically sober TV performances by Heinz-Christian Strache, its leader. The mud-fighting between the two governing parties has distracted attention from the FPO's own scandals; one of its local councillors was accused of shouting ""Heil Hitler!"" at a meeting last week, for example. 
Much depends on Vienna, where the traditionally dominant SPO is in chaos and the other two main parties are newly competitive. The capital's middle-class suburbs are Mr Kurz's political hinterland, while the FPO is making strides in working-class areas unsettled by immigration. 
If, as polls suggest, the SPO comes third nationally, Mr Kurz will probably do a deal with the FPO. When his party formed such a government back in 2000 it was met, for a time, with international ostracism and sanctions, but recent populist advances elsewhere make such a coalition much less unusual. Still, says Anton Pelinka, a political scientist, a nationalist ""black-blue"" government in Vienna would create a new headache for Angela Merkel, tilting Austria towards authoritarian central European governments like those of Poland and Hungary. 
In any case, governing with the FPO would not be easy. Mr Strache has a large ego and more experience than any other front-line Austrian politician. His reasonable manner belies his party's far-right elements and tendency to infighting. Meanwhile, Mr Kurz should expect resistance from his own camp: OVP-aligned interest groups and the party's six state governors bridle at some of his talk of reform and transparency. His charm and political agility are not in doubt. But whether the Wunderwuzzi can run a fractious country remains unclear.","A scandal - mired election could produce a new right - wing coalition in Austria

SEBASTIAN KURZ has a problem. On October 15th Austria's 31-year-old foreign minister scored an impressive election victory, somehow presenting himself as a credible messenger of change even though his centre-right Austrian People's Party (OVP) has been in office for 30 years. His energy and charisma kept the Freedom Party (FPO), a far-right outfit with neo-Nazi roots, from running the country; it had led in the polls for two years before Mr Kurz took over as chairman of the OVP in May. But to govern Mr Kurz needs a coalition partner, and the FPO, which came third in the election, is his first choice. Now Europe is left wondering whether Austria's political whizz kid is fending off a populist uprising, or preparing to lead it. 
Mr Kurz spoke to your columnist this week. He was fresh from a day spent discussing the vagaries of coalition politics with Austria's president, and taking a congratulatory call from France's Emmanuel Macron. Should he become chancellor, Mr Kurz will be the world's youngest head of government (Kim Jong-Un has three years on him). Older readers who fear a decline in decorum among millennials should be reassured. Charlemagne was greeted with the greatest of courtesy and thanked profusely for finding time to visit Vienna; afterwards he was walked personally to the ministry's exit and seen off with a formal bow. 
Yet Mr Kurz's charm conceals a rough edge. Coalition talks will begin on October 20th, but Mr Kurz will not speculate on what a deal with the FPO might look like. In 2000, when the two right-wing parties first formed a government, EU governments cut bilateral links and Israel recalled its ambassador. Alert to the dangers, this week Mr Kurz told an Israeli daily that he would not accept anti-Semitism in a coalition partner. Besides, these days the FPO leadership sees more fertile ground in Islamophobia and Austria-first nationalism. It has formal links to Vladimir Putin's United Russia party, and portrays the EU as a threat to a ""Europe of fatherlands"". If Mr Kurz does link arms with the FPO (and other coalitions are possible), his European counterparts will need convincing that the nationalist influence will be muted. 
A second fear among Europeans is that Mr Kurz himself is merely a rabble-rousing populist in centrist clothing. He earned his reputation abroad by adopting a tough line during the refugee crisis of 2015-16, when Austria was taking in, per person, more asylum-seekers than any EU country bar Sweden. In early 2016, before Angela Merkel convinced Turkey to keep refugees from Europe's shores, Mr Kurz plotted with Balkan ministers to close the borders across which they had been pouring. He then turned his attention to Italy, hammering the NGOs he said were smuggling migrants across the Mediterranean, and threatening to deploy troops to the Brenner Pass. All this has some Europeans fearing Mr Kurz could join the leaders of Hungary and Poland in an axis of resistance to migration. 
Yet Mr Kurz's obdurate stance on borders is now conventional wisdom across the EU. Moreover, he cut his political teeth on a subject that is less typical of far-right populism: how to integrate immigrants. Here Mr Kurz has something for both sides. He wants to help newcomers learn German and find jobs. But he also denounces Islamic radicalism and plays up the difficulty of integrating refugees from countries with ""different systems"", like Afghanistan and Iraq. And he defends Austria's ban on face-covering veils, a solution in search of a problem. (Few Austrian Muslims wear veils, but the ban recently ensnared a man clad in a full-body shark costume.) 
Confidantes of the minister describe a good listener eager for advice and untroubled by history or ideology. ""For me, the EU has always been a given,"" says Mr Kurz, who was eight when Austria joined. That might explain his readiness to question its free-movement rules--he frets about so-called benefit tourism--and to jab at a meddlesome Brussels bureaucracy. Some find his openness to ending sanctions on Russia and backing strongmen in the Balkans naive. But supporters welcome his pragmatism. 
Mr Kurz is also keen to flaunt his pro-European credentials. His government, he says, would be ""as supportive as possible"" of Mr Macron's proposals for EU reform, even if he distrusts some of his ideas on the euro zone. (""We are on the German side,"" he says, even before being asked about any specific policies.) 
Europeans are right to fear a right-wing coalition in Austria. The FPO is a nasty party harbouring unreconstructed neo-Nazis, and its enduring strength is Austria's shame. But its electoral success means it must now face the dilemma that confronts many radical-right parties: the compromises of coalition versus the purifying rage of opposition. It has already had to drop its advocacy of an Austrian exit from the EU, after realising that few voters were interested. The FPO would earn government posts in a coalition, perhaps including the next foreign or interior minister, as well as extracting some policy concessions. But Mr Kurz will not allow himself to be tugged out of the European mainstream. 
All Europe contributed to the making of Kurz 
Mr Kurz's critics have been too quick to confuse a focus on border management with xenophobia. He makes the opposite case: properly integrating newcomers, he insists, goes ""hand-in-hand"" with showing that migration is under control. Integration, he accepts, will be ""extremely difficult"", and his critics will hardly be calmed by his flirtation with the FPO. But the relative quiet at Europe's borders offers him space to make good on his claim. 
Mr Kurz's ascent has been fuelled by two factors: tough talk on borders, and the Macronesque appeal of a fresh face to a weary electorate. Both of these will wear off soon enough. He will not lead a populist revolt in central Europe; he will probably spend more time fighting vested interests at home. But he may be the first European leader forged in the heat of the refugee crisis. That experience has shaped his thinking, and Europe's too.","Will Sebastian Kurz pacify Austria 's populists , or fire them up ? 
 Sebastian Kurz has a problem . On October 15th Sebastian Kurz's scored an impressive election victory , somehow presenting Sebastian Kurz as a credible messenger of change even though Sebastian Kurz's centre - right Austrian People 's Party ( OVP ) has been in office for 30 years . Sebastian Kurz's energy and charisma kept the Freedom Party ( FPO ) , a far - right outfit with neo - Nazi roots , from running the country ; it had led in the polls for two years before Sebastian Kurz took over as chairman of the OVP in May. But to govern Sebastian Kurz needs a coalition partner , and the FPO , which came third in the election , is Sebastian Kurz's first choice . Now Europe is left wondering whether Sebastian Kurz's is fending off a populist uprising , or preparing to lead it . 
 Sebastian Kurz spoke to your columnist this week . Sebastian Kurz was fresh from a day spent discussing the vagaries of coalition politics with Austria 's president , and taking a congratulatory call from France 's Emmanuel Macron . Should Sebastian Kurz become chancellor , Sebastian Kurz will be the world 's youngest head of government ( Kim Jong - Un has three years on him ) . Older readers who fear a decline in decorum among millennials should be reassured . Sebastian Kurz was greeted with the greatest of courtesy and thanked profusely for finding time to visit Vienna ; afterwards Sebastian Kurz was walked personally to the ministry 's exit and seen off with a formal bow . 
 Yet Sebastian Kurz's charm conceals a rough edge . Coalition talks will begin on October 20th , but Sebastian Kurz will not speculate on what a deal with the FPO might look like . In 2000 , when the two right - wing parties first formed a government , EU governments cut bilateral links and Israel recalled its ambassador . Alert to the dangers , this week Sebastian Kurz told an Israeli daily that Sebastian Kurz would not accept anti - Semitism in a coalition partner . Besides , these days the FPO leadership sees more fertile ground in Islamophobia and Austria - first nationalism . It has formal links to Vladimir Putin 's United Russia party , and portrays the EU as a threat to a "" Europe of fatherlands "" . If Sebastian Kurz does link arms with the FPO ( and other coalitions are possible ) , Sebastian Kurz's European counterparts will need convincing that the nationalist influence will be muted . 
 A second fear among Europeans is that Sebastian Kurz is merely a rabble - rousing populist in centrist clothing . Sebastian Kurz earned Sebastian Kurz's reputation abroad by adopting a tough line during the refugee crisis of 2015 - 16 , when Austria was taking in , per person , more asylum - seekers than any EU country bar Sweden . In early 2016 , before Angela Merkel convinced Turkey to keep refugees from Europe 's shores , Sebastian Kurz plotted with Balkan ministers to close the borders across which they had been pouring . Sebastian Kurz then turned Sebastian Kurz's attention to Italy , hammering the NGOs Sebastian Kurz said were smuggling migrants across the Mediterranean , and threatening to deploy troops to the Brenner Pass . All this has some Europeans fearing Sebastian Kurz could join the leaders of Hungary and Poland in an axis of resistance to migration . 
 Yet Sebastian Kurz's obdurate stance on borders is now conventional wisdom across the EU . Moreover , Sebastian Kurz cut Sebastian Kurz's political teeth on a subject that is less typical of far - right populism : how to integrate immigrants .

WHY does it keep happening? Consider some events of the past week. Andrej Babis, a tycoon with a populist bent, sweeps aside the old guard in a Czech election. Fresh from his own electoral success, Sebastian Kurz, the boy wonder of Austrian conservatism, opens coalition talks with a far-right party that harbours former neo-Nazis in its ranks. Dozens of deputies from the anti-immigrant Alternative for Germany party take their seats in a Bundestag that was supposed never to find space for their kind, while Viktor Orban, the father of Hungary's illiberal democracy, declares central Europe a ""migrant-free zone"". 
It is tempting to seek a single explanation for these disparate phenomena. Perhaps Angela Merkel's open-door refugee policy of 2015 is to blame. Maybe this is the rage of those left behind by the uneven distribution of globalisation's booty. Or it could be that the central Europeans have had enough of the overbearing bully-boys of Brussels. Worse, if these outcomes stem from a common cause, some fear they might coalesce into a common threat. Surveying the bleak landscape, one commentator discerns ""an insurrection by the Habsburg Empire against the EU."" 
That is a misunderstanding. True, the likes of Mr Orban or Jaroslaw Kaczynski, the de facto leader of Poland, pose a genuine threat to the EU by undermining its legal order. But most of the neighbourhood's leaders seek to harness the benefits of the club they belong to. Mr Kurz's obsession with managing migration leads him to advocate collective European border controls rather than bash Eurocrats. Mr Babis is a pragmatist who knows his country's success rests on Europe's integrated supply chains and open internal borders. Indeed, Robert Fico, the prime minister of Slovakia, is currently enjoying a star turn as the region's Europhile-in-chief. All have been happy to use the EU as a punchbag when expedient. None wants to blow it up. 
Rather than an inveterate nationalist or Eurosceptic, Mr Babis is in fact a man of ""no ideology whatsoever,"" in the words of a Czech official. Yet this makes his political success, posing as an anti-elitist outsider, even harder to grasp. The Czech economy is one of Europe's zippiest. Czechs suffer few of the historical grievances or cultural cleavages that beset their neighbours. And yet almost one-third of them plumped for an angry billionaire who spends his time lambasting the political system as a cabal of corrupt insiders (despite serving as finance minister for the past four years). His great champion, President Milos Zeman, is a hard-living, Putin-loving boor who this week brandished a mock AK-47 bearing the inscription ""For journalists"". The new parliament will be chock-full of anti-system parties (see page 33), including Mr Babis's ANO. What makes the Czechs so cranky? 
One clue might lie in unreasonable expectations about what EU membership could bring the ex-communist countries of Europe. Nearly 30 years after 1989, wages in the Czech Republic are 40% that of neighbouring Germany. A related gripe is a perceived sniffiness from the West, expressed in exaggerated central European fears that food multinationals are dumping second-rate products on to their markets. The European Commission's response to eastern jitters has been to insist that all EU projects, such as the single currency, should be open to all EU countries, not just the usual suspects in the West. But in non-euro countries like the Czech Republic, even mentioning euro membership sounds like a haughty warning to join, or be left behind. 
Emmanuel Macron takes a different approach. Over the summer France's president toured central Europe, glad-handing friendly leaders while shunning Messrs Orban and Kaczynski. This divide-and-conquer stratagem paid off handsomely this week when the Czechs and Slovaks broke ranks with a group of eastern European countries to back a tightening of cross-border labour rules inside the EU, a totemic issue for Mr Macron. Today France's relations with Poland are at rock-bottom. But things are going swimmingly with the Czechs. 
The morrow would obliterate the plans of today 
What does unite the populists of the east is the fragility of the institutions around them. Political parties come and go with alarming speed, often, as with ANO, merely serving as vehicles for the interests of an individual or small group. Bureaucracies may be malleable to political caprice. Media and civil society may not have the strength or independence to check leaders' excesses. 
Mr Orban has exploited these weaknesses to reshape Hungary's institutions to serve his Fidesz party and its cronies, while railing against ""globalists"" like George Soros, a Hungarian-born financier, and the European officials who supposedly dance to his drum. Mr Kaczynski, despite holding no government post, has embarked on a messianic mission to reinvent the Polish state to correct what he considers the injustices of the post-1989 settlement. Both men lead parties that dominate opinion polls, crowd out opponents and foul the air. 
The Czech system has its own fissures, but Mr Babis poses a different sort of threat. The risk is not of an ideological reshaping of the state, but of weak institutions failing to restrain oligarchic rule. Mr Babis, the second-richest person in the Czech Republic, has vast agricultural and industrial holdings (though he has placed them in a trust) and two newspapers. In his modestly titled book What I Dream Of When I Happen To Be Sleeping, he proposes scrapping checks on power, like the Senate or town councils. Lacking a majority in parliament, Mr Babis cannot inflict too much damage. But Milan Nic, an analyst at the German Council on Foreign Relations, worries about who may follow in his wake. 
Certainly, Mr Babis and his kind warrant a certain vigilance. But Europe need not gird itself for Habsburg mutiny. There is no tidal wave of revolutionary populism washing over the east. That is just as well, for managing the swirling eddies of central Europe's politics presents enough of a challenge.","The new star of Czech politics is not about to lead an anti - Europe uprising

IT IS a measure of populism's rise that the announcement of a coalition deal between the centre-right Austrian People's Party (OVP) and the right-wing Austrian Freedom Party (FPO) on December 16th caused barely a ruffle. When the two last formed a government, back in 2000, the news provoked diplomatic sanctions: visits and meetings were cancelled. No longer exceptional, Austria faces no sign of any such quarantine in Europe today. 
To be sure, there are concerns in Berlin and Brussels. The FPO, which has a ""co-operation agreement"" with Vladimir Putin's United Russia party and is close to the autocratic leaders of Hungary and Poland, will henceforth run Austria's foreign, interior and defence ministries--and with them the country's diplomatic and security services. But this is a shift of degree, not direction: the Alpine republic has long been doveish on Russia and closer to the central Europeans than to Angela Merkel on both immigration and Islam. The coalition agreement commits Austria to the EU and the euro, and Sebastian Kurz, the incoming chancellor, will take over European competences that used to sit in the foreign ministry (as did he). 
If Austria in 2000 presaged the recent populist surge, the country's new government, too, may contain glimpses of wider trends. (Something similar already exists in Norway, where the Conservatives govern in alliance with the more populist Progress Party.) Taking over as leader only in July, Mr Kurz took his OVP from third place to first by melding a modern style (sidelining the dinosaurs and recruiting candidates from outside politics) with a commitment to do something about Austrian economic underperformance, coupled with an uncompromisingly right-wing stance on crime and immigration. Conservatives elsewhere in Europe are watching with interest. Jens Spahn, a junior German finance minister who is regarded as a possible successor to Mrs Merkel, snapped selfies with Mr Kurz at the OVP's election-night party on October 15th. 
Meanwhile, the FPO's revival--its six-year spell in government from 2000 split the party and cost it half of its voters--under Heinz-Christian Strache is a model for populist nationalists. ""HC"", as he is known, gave the party a more youthful image, embraced social media before other politicians and rejected the FPO's erstwhile anti-Semitism (recognising Jerusalem as Israel's capital long before Donald Trump) in favour of an anti-Islam credo. France's National Front and the Alternative for Germany party have both taken inspiration from his strategy. 
The coalition agreement is a synthesis of the two men's political projects. Maintenance payments for accepted refugees will more than halve to EUR 365 a month, and newcomers will have to hand over any cash they have and waive some rights to medical secrecy. Islamic schools will be monitored more closely and closed if they break rules or accept foreign funding. Drugs and sex crimes will attract tougher sentences. Over 2,000 more police will patrol the streets. Income and corporation tax will fall. Austria's corporatist labour and welfare model will be liberalised: maximum working time will rise to 12 hours a day, for example, and job-based insurance funds will be consolidated. 
But can Mr Kurz avoid being forced to make less palatable concessions to the FPO? Some in Vienna (including Die Presse, an OVP-friendly newspaper) compare him to David Cameron, another metropolitan conservative reliant on the Eurosceptic right. ""What Tory hardliners were for Cameron the FPO could be for Kurz,"" predicts Josef Lentsch, a think-tanker who is close to the liberal NEOs party, adding that although an ""Oxit"" referendum on EU membership is off the cards, the new chancellor will soon find himself under pressure to pick fights with Brussels and edge closer to the nationalist governments to the east. ""I trust that the Austrian government will continue to play a constructive and pro-European role,"" said Donald Tusk, president of the European Council, on December 18th. Behind the affirmation lay a none-too-subtle warning.

Angela Merkel finally grants her party a serious choice ab out its future
TWO weeks ago, Germany's chancellor seemed to be in trouble. Her Christian Democrat (cdu) party and the more conservative Christian Social Union (csu), its Bavarian sister, hated the bland coalition deal she had just forged with the Social Democrat (spd) leadership. They also hated the fact that she had conceded the mighty German finance ministry to her prospective centre-left partners to help them win a membership vote, the result of which is due on March 4th. And they hated the fact that she had not brought any prospective successors into the cabinet.
Since then, however, Angela Merkel has rewritten the final chapters of her chancellorship. At a cdu conference in Berlin on February 26th Annegret KrampKarrenbauer, her preferred candidate to be general secretary (and, many reckon, to succeed her as chancellor) was elected to the job with 98.9% of votes. The party also opted for a new ""grand coalition"" with the spd by a similar margin. In her speech, Mrs Merkel blamed her poor election result in September on Unbehagen, or malaise, about the capacity of the German state in moments like the refugee crisis, about technological change and about an unpredictable wider world.
It is still possible that the spd members will vote against the coalition deal. In that case Mrs Merkel would probably form a 1 minority government, though it would be unlikely to last a full four years. Or she could try to force new elections. But it looks more likely that grass-roots Social Democrats will-very reluctantly-back the deal. If so, Mrs Merkel's fourth term as German chancellor will begin around mid-March.
Several new figures would then mark German politics. Olaf Scholz, the fiscally conservative spd mayor of Hamburg, would be finance minister and thus dominate discussions with Emmanuel Macron, the French president, on euro-zone reform. The pugilistic Andrea Nahles, the incoming spd leader, would strive to give her party new definition in the Bundestag. Mrs Kramp-Karrenbauer, the moderate former minister-president of the Saarland, would launch a programme of renewal in the cdu. In her speech at her party's conference in Berlin she committed to making it once more ""the place where there's a real contest"". Meanwhile Jens Spahn, an ambitious mp from the Rhineland, would become health minister.
The expected contest between Mrs Kramp-Karrenbauer and Mr Spahn to replace Mrs Merkel-who most people in Berlin assume will step down before the next election, due in 2021-would pit two starkly different visions of the cdu/csu alliance against each other. The former, aged 55, belongs like Mrs Merkel to the party's Christian-social wing. She is a social conservative and economic centrist who as leader would probably prefer yet another coalition with the spd. By contrast Mr Spahn, who is only 37, and is gay, belongs to the cdu's socially liberal wing, yet has won over the party's conservatives with a tough line on immigration and integration, and would most probably seek to form a new government with his friend Christian Lindner of the pro-business Free Democrats, if the numbers permitted. He admires dynamic young centre-right European leaders like Sebastian Kurz in Austria and Leo Varadkar in Ireland.
For Europe a new German ""grand coalition"" would be preferable to the alternative: more muddle. The continent's mightiest economy has now gone five months without leadership. Mr Macron and others want to do a preliminary deal by June to strengthen the euro zone before its next crisis. A ""no"" from the spd membership would make a new government before the autumn unlikely. But even a ""yes"" would leave big questions open. Would spd control of the finance ministry move Germany much towards French proposals on the integration of the euro zone? Would Mrs Kramp-Karrenbauer consolidate her position as Mrs Merkel's preferred successor? Would Mr Spahn stay loyal or agitate against the chancellor? Mrs Merkel's position is secure for now. What comes next is less certain.","Germany

They also hated the fact that she had conceded the mighty German finance ministry to her prospective centre-left partners to help them win a membership vote, the result of which is due on March 4th. And they hated the fact that she had not brought any prospective successors into the cabinet.
Since then, however, Angela Merkel has rewritten the final chapters of her chancellorship. At a cdu conference in Berlin on February 26th Annegret KrampKarrenbauer, her preferred candidate to be general secretary (and, many reckon, to succeed her as chancellor) was elected to the job with 98.9% of votes. The party also opted for a new ""grand coalition"" with the spd by a similar margin. In her speech, Mrs Merkel blamed her poor election result in September on Unbehagen, or malaise, about the capacity of the German state in moments like the refugee crisis, about technological change and about an unpredictable wider world.
It is still possible that the spd members will vote against the coalition deal. In that case Mrs Merkel would probably form a 1 minority government, though it would be unlikely to last a full four years. Or she could try to force new elections. But it looks more likely that grass-roots Social Democrats will-very reluctantly-back the deal. If so, Mrs Merkel's fourth term as German chancellor will begin around mid-March.
Several new figures would then mark German politics. Olaf Scholz, the fiscally conservative spd mayor of Hamburg, would be finance minister and thus dominate discussions with Emmanuel Macron, the French president, on euro-zone reform. The pugilistic Andrea Nahles, the incoming spd leader, would strive to give her party new definition in the Bundestag. Mrs Kramp-Karrenbauer, the moderate former minister-president of the Saarland, would launch a programme of renewal in the cdu. In her speech at her party's conference in Berlin she committed to making it once more ""the place where there's a real contest"". Meanwhile Jens Spahn, an ambitious mp from the Rhineland, would become health minister.
The expected contest between Mrs Kramp-Karrenbauer and Mr Spahn to replace Mrs Merkel-who most people in Berlin assume will step down before the next election, due in 2021-would pit two starkly different visions of the cdu/csu alliance against each other. The former, aged 55, belongs like Mrs Merkel to the party's Christian-social wing. She is a social conservative and economic centrist who as leader would probably prefer yet another coalition with the spd. By contrast Mr Spahn, who is only 37, and is gay, belongs to the cdu's socially liberal wing, yet has won over the party's conservatives with a tough line on immigration and integration, and would most probably seek to form a new government with his friend Christian Lindner of the pro-business Free Democrats, if the numbers permitted. He admires dynamic young centre-right European leaders like Sebastian Kurz in Austria and Leo Varadkar in Ireland.
For Europe a new German ""grand coalition"" would be preferable to the alternative: more muddle. The continent's mightiest economy has now gone five months without leadership. Mr Macron and others want to do a preliminary deal by June to strengthen the euro zone before its next crisis. A ""no"" from the spd membership would make a new government before the autumn unlikely. But even a ""yes"" would leave big questions open. Would spd control of the finance ministry move Germany much towards French proposals on the integration of the euro zone? Would Mrs Kramp-Karrenbauer consolidate her position as Mrs Merkel's preferred successor? Would Mr Spahn stay loyal or agitate against the chancellor? Mrs Merkel's position is secure for now. What comes next is less certain.",305,Austria,se-305-3,,False,,0,True

Donald Trump and Kim Jong Un, North Korea's dictator, held a summit in Singapore. Mr Kim promised ""complete denuclearisation"" in exchange for American security guarantees. Mr Trump called it ""a very great moment in the history of the world"". Critics noted that North Korea has always broken such promises in the past.
South Korea's ruling party won provincial and municipal elections by a landslide, capturing14 of 17 governorships. It marked the first time that liberal candidates had ever won in several south-eastern provinces. The popularity of Moon Jae-in, the president, has been buoyed by the recent detente with North Korea.
Hundreds of people stormed government offices in Vietnam to protest against a draft law that would let foreigners hold leases of up to 99 years on property. They fear that Chinese investors will buy lots of land. The law's adoption has been delayed.
Taiwan's president attended the opening of a new building for the American Institute in Taiwan, America's unofficial embassy in the country. China, which bristles at anything that even hints at diplomatic recognition of Taiwan, had warned America not to send a senior official. America dispatched a lowly undersecretary of state.
A court in Hong Kong sentenced a prominent activist, Edward Leung, to six years in prison for his role in a riot in 2016 triggered by officials' efforts to remove street stalls selling traditional snacks. Mr Leung had angered the Chinese government by supporting independence for Hong Kong.
Lorry drivers staged strikes in several Chinese cities. They were protesting against fuel costs and competition from app-based haulage services.
Reversal of fortune
With a tiny majority in Parliament and faced with a rebellion from a handful of Tory mps opposed to Brexit, the British government promised mps what Remainers hope will be a ""meaningful"" vote on whether to approve whatever deal emerges from talks with the eu. This week's machinations make it more likely that the United Kingdom will end up with a ""soft"" Brexit.
The governments of Macedonia and Greece agreed on a new name for the former, which is seated at the un as the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia. The country's new name, Northern Macedonia, is designed to appease Greek sensitivities about cultural appropriation.
The Aquarius, a rescue vessel carrying more than 600 migrants from north Africa, was refused access to Italian ports by Matteo Salvini, Italy's new nationalist interior minister. After two days of impasse, Spain, under its new Socialist government, stepped forward to offer the ship a berth in Valencia. Italy did accept migrants on an Italianflagged ship.
Austria's chancellor, Sebastian Kurz, proposed the creation of what he called an ""axis of willing"" among Germany, Italy and Austria to curb illegal migration. Critics wondered whether the word ""axis"" had quite the right historical ring to it.
Scales of justice
Jean-Pierre Bemba, a former Congolese warlord, had his conviction for crimes against humanity overturned on appeal. He still awaits sentence on a separate charge of bribing witnesses, but the International Criminal Court ordered his release. His supporters want him to return to the Democratic Republic of Congo and run for president.
An American soldier was killed and four wounded in Somalia after they were attacked by al-Shabab, a jihadist group. America is mulling whether to scale back its military operations in Africa.
A coalition led by Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates attacked Hodeida, the main entry port for aid in Yemen, in a bid to wrest it from the Houthis, a group of Shia rebels who chased the government out of Sana'a, the capital, in 2015. The un had warned that fighting over the port could disrupt the supply of food to Yemeni cities, putting millions at risk of hunger.
A fire destroyed part of a depot in Iraq where ballot papers were being stored after a disputed election in May. Iraq's parliament had ordered a recount of the ballots amid allegations of vote-rigging.
Use it or lose it
America's Supreme Court sided with Ohio, which had removed the name of a man who did not vote regularly from the electoral register. Federal law forbids the automatic removal of lax voters from the rolls, but states have a duty to keep their information up to date. The court found that a notice of intent to remove the man from the register did not violate the rules.
Mark Sanford, a Republican congressman from South Carolina who has often criticised Donald Trump, was defeated in a primary election. Mr Sanford previously made headlines in 2009 when, as governor, he disappeared for a week. It turned out he was having an affair. The official explanation for his absence, that he was ""hiking the Appalachians"", became a popular euphemism for infidelity.
The non-believer
The g? summit in Canada was the most rancorous in the club's history. America clashed with its allies over climate change and trade. Donald Trump refused to sign the final communique, accusingJustin Trudeau, the Canadian prime minister, of making ""false statements"". ""There's a special place in hell"" for those who act in bad faith, said Mr Trump's trade adviser, Peter Navarro.
America extradited Ricardo Martinelli, a former president of Panama, to his home country to face trial on charges of corruption and wiretapping. He is accused of using public money to spy on 150 rivals.
Pope Francis accepted the resignation of three Chilean bishops. They include Juan Barros, who was accused of covering up sexual abuse of children by a priest.
On the eve of the 2018 World Cup, the 2026 tournament was awarded jointly to the United States, Canada and Mexico. The members of fifa, football's governing body, ignored recent tensions among the three countries in choosing their joint bid over Morocco's. Mr Trump will no longer be president by the time the tournament is played. It is also possible that the North American Free-Trade Agreement will have been dissolved by then.
Business
A federal judge approved the proposed merger of at&t and Time Warner, a big defeat for the Department of Justice, which had tried to block the deal on antitrust grounds. Both companies argued that combining their assets was necessary in a media environment that has been disrupted by Amazon, Netflix and others. The decision opened the door to more dealmaking in the industry. Soon after the ruling Comcast launched a $65bn takeover bid for some of 21st Century Fox's assets, topping a rival offer from Disney.
The Federal Reserve lifted its benchmark interest rate by a quarter of a percentage point, to a range of between 1.75% and 2%, the second rise this year. The last time the rate was 2% was mid-2008, before the worst of the financial crisis. The Fed hinted at two more rises this year, and dropped its prediction that monetary policy would remain stimulative for some time.
In France the High Council for Financial Stability for the first time raised the ""countercyclical"" capital buffer, obliging banks to fund themselves with additional equity amounting to 0.25% of risk-weighted assets. The aim is to force banks to store up capital when the economy is strong. The hcfc is worried about mounting household and corporate private-sector debt, which hit 130% of French gdp in late 2017.
Seeking a better relationship
Christine Lagarde, the managing director of the imf, said that protecting Argentina's poor and most vulnerable was central to the plan thrashed out between the fund and the Argentine government following the sharp fall in the peso. The imf is extending a $50bn line of credit to Argentina in return for quicker reductions of the budget deficit and hard targets to tame inflation. The deal also includes measures to increase welfare spending if the economy worsens.
Voters in a referendum in Switzerland overwhelmingly rejected a proposal to remove the ability of commercial banks to create money (through lending). The Swiss National Bankdescribed the result as a relief; the Vollgeld plan envisaged the public holding current accounts directly with the central bank.
A national-security threat?
The Trump administration reached an agreement with zte, a Chinese maker of telecoms equipment, that overturns a ban on zte acquiring American components. In return zte must pay a $1bn fine for violating sanctions against Iran and North Korea, replace its senior management and allow America to monitor its activities. That was not enough for Congress, which moved to scotch the deal. zte's share price swooned on its first day of trading following a twomonth suspension.
Adyen, a Dutch payments platform that counts Netflix and Uber among its customers, made its stockmarket debut in Amsterdam. Its share price doubled above the offer price, giving it a market value of €i4bn ($i6.5bn). It was one of the biggest European technology ipos in recent years.
Tesla is to reduce its global workforce by 9%, or around 3,500 employees, part of an effort to streamline management and generate sustainable profits. The job cuts won't affect production workers, who are racing to reach the all-important target of making 5,000 Model 3 cars a week by the end of June.
Toyota paid $ibn for a stake in Grab, a ride-hailing startup based in Singapore. It is the latest big investment by a conventional carmaker in technologies and firms that are disrupting the industry. Grab operates in eight South-East Asian countries. In March it bought Uber's business in the region; under the deal, Uber took a 27.5% stake in Grab.
German authorities handed Volkswagen a €ibn ($i.2bn) fine for cheating emissions tests, one of the biggest-ever penalties levied against a company in Germany.
Just a month after it passed the measure unanimously, Seattle's governing council rescinded a tax on the city's biggest companies amounting to $275 per full-time employee. The tax was intended to raise money to ease Seattle's homelessness problem, but met fierce resistance from Amazon, Starbucks and others with headquarters there. Amazon described the levy as ""hostile"". Such ""head taxes"" are being considered in other cities, including San Francisco, where the growth of tech firms is blamed for pushing locals out of the housing market.
A spanner in the works
In a decision with ramifications for the country's gig economy, Britain's Supreme Court ruled that an independent contractor for Pimlico Plumbers could be classified as an employee, entitling him to paid holiday, sick pay and other benefits. The court found that, although the plumber's contract bore features of being self-employed, his work was controlled and restricted by the firm, akin to a normal job.

IT WAS all smiles this week as Austria assumed the rotating presidency of the Council of the European Union, one of the club's law-making bodies. But behind the scenes Sebastian Kurz, Austria's young chancellor, provokes knotted brows. Mr Kurz's political identity, more than that of most other European leaders, is bound up with illegal immigration. Fans say his tough line, honed as foreign minister during the 2015-16 refugee crisis, blunts the appeal of the far-right Freedom Party (fpö), the junior coalition partner to his centre-right People's Party. Foes say his shift towards harshness makes it hard to tell the difference between moderates and extremists. ""Kurz is on a dangerous course,"" said Jean Asselborn, Luxembourg's foreign minister, this week.
In office for barely six months, Mr Kurz has made his share of enemies. Some detect a whiff of demagoguery. There have been mis-steps: a meeting with the Bavarian government, which raised eyebrows in Berlin; Mr Kurz's call for a European ""axis of the willing"" against illegal immigration. Some salty language has surfaced in Austrian documents on the difficulties of integrating men from regions marked by ""patriarchal...or backward-looking religious attitudes"". Even central European officials fear the Austrians sometimes go too far. ""There's a naked populism there,"" shudders an eu official who has watched Mr Kurz in action.
That seems unfair. The well-coiffed Mr Kurz may have swallowed large parts of the fpö's platform, but he never rails against elites or dabbles in George Soros conspiracy theories. Inside Austria, many see him more as opportunist than grand schemer. ""I'm not sure Kurz has a strategy for Europe beyond trying to remain chancellor of Austria,"" says Laurenz Ennser-Jedenastik of the University of Vienna. Yet all agree on his remarkably well-tuned political antennae. Mr Kurz detected earlier than his counterparts, such as Angela Merkel in Germany, that illegal immigration demanded a firm response from the mainstream right. ""It's not a question of left or right,"" he told Charlemagne this week from his office in Vienna. ""It's just a question of rational politics.""
So it rather suits Mr Kurz that Austria takes the helm just as Europe's migration headache has come thumping back. At a summit last week the eu's heads of government again agreed to try to overcome their long-running differences over how to share responsibility for asylum-seekers who reach Europe. In its new role the Austrian government must try to broker a deal, but it has no faith that it will find the breakthrough that eluded so many others. Instead Herbert Kickl, the interior minister and an fpö member, has urged a ""Copernican revolution"" in asylum policy. And there is a model. ""We have to learn from Australia,"" says Mr Kurz.
To simplify a bit, following the Australian model means doing two things. First, taking tough action along borders, at sea and ""upstream"" (inside Africa) to slash the number of asylum-seekers smuggled to Europe. Second, striking deals with poorer countries to establish camps, run with un agencies, to receive, detain and, eventually, return migrants. Thwarting smuggling, the argument goes, would reduce drownings at sea (over 1,000 have died this year), and reassure voters who might otherwise be tempted by the far right. A bit of theatre helps, too; in June the Austrians sent police and troops to the Slovenian border to stage an exercise in pushing back refugees. Says one Austrian official, ""80% of the work has to be calming down others.""
The summit gestured in this direction by proposing ""disembarkation platforms"" for migrants saved at sea. Mr Kurz calls it a ""milestone"". But among many unanswered questions was whether such migrants would then be able to apply for asylum in the eu. The Austrians insist that they must not. Otherwise the centres would become magnets for fresh migrants from across Africa-irritating the countries that must be persuaded to host them.
Fortress Europe, then? If so, it has a gate. Once order at the borders has been restored and voters reassured, genuine refugees may be selected for resettlement by eu countries via the UN's refugee agency-albeit in far smaller numbers than in 2015-16. ""It's much more humanitarian to help those really in need than those who are able to pay for a smuggler,"" says Mr Kurz. Even the central Europeans, who refuse to accept refugees redistributed inside the eu, might play along if they can choose them from outside.
What voters can bear in Canb erra
Control first; then generosity. It is an alluring thought. Europe's model, in which asylum is reserved mainly for people who somehow reach its territory, guarantees smuggling and drowning. Conversely, Australia resettles proportionally more refugees via the unhcr than almost any other country. It also admits huge numbers of economic migrants. But it should not be a model for Europe. It pays Nauru and Papua New Guinea to house its asylum-seekers in grim ""offshore processing"" camps. Convincing African countries to do something similar would require cannier diplomacy than the eu can muster, combining trade, migration, visa and development tools. Italy's previous government was getting there with Libya, but at questionable humanitarian cost.
Mr Kurz matters because Europe's divided governments are desperately groping for a solution to their immigration problems that falls short of the full Australia. Yet their domestic politics are pushing them to demand ever tougher action, even as asylum applications and border crossings fall. This leaves the eu flailing around with a mishmash of policies that tread a fine line between politics, international law and operational reality. Each step gradually erodes Europe's territorial principle for asylum.
There is a curious symmetry to this. Mr Kurz brought far-right ideas into the Austrian mainstream to keep the parties that originally peddled them away from the top table. Now his European counterparts are adopting elements of his migration proposals in the hope that they will forestall something much more brutal. They assume that this remains possible. It may not be. ?","Europe is slowly groping towards the tough immigration policies of Sebastian Kurz

But among many unanswered questions was whether such migrants would then be able to apply for asylum in the eu . The Austrians insist that they must not . Otherwise the centres would become magnets for fresh migrants from across Africa - irritating the countries that must be persuaded to host them . 
 Fortress Europe , then ? If so , it has a gate . Once order at the borders has been restored and voters reassured , genuine refugees may be selected for resettlement by eu countries via the UN 's refugee agency - albeit in far smaller numbers than in 2015 - 16 . "" It 's much more humanitarian to help those really in need than those who are able to pay for a smuggler , "" says Sebastian Kurz . Even the central Europeans , who refuse to accept refugees redistributed inside the eu , might play along if they can choose them from outside . 
 What voters can bear in Canb erra 
 Control first ; then generosity . It is an alluring thought . Europe 's model , in which asylum is reserved mainly for people who somehow reach its territory , guarantees smuggling and drowning . Conversely , Australia resettles proportionally more refugees via the unhcr than almost any other country . It also admits huge numbers of economic migrants . But it should not be a model for Europe . It pays Nauru and Papua New Guinea to house its asylum - seekers in grim "" offshore processing "" camps . Convincing African countries to do something similar would require cannier diplomacy than the eu can muster , combining trade , migration , visa and development tools . Italy 's previous government was getting there with Libya , but at questionable humanitarian cost . 
 Sebastian Kurz matters because Europe 's divided governments are desperately groping for a solution to their immigration problems that falls short of the full Australia . Yet their domestic politics are pushing them to demand ever tougher action , even as asylum applications and border crossings fall . This leaves the eu flailing around with a mishmash of policies that tread a fine line between politics , international law and operational reality . Each step gradually erodes Europe 's territorial principle for asylum . 
 There is a curious symmetry to this . Sebastian Kurz brought far - right ideas into the Austrian mainstream to keep the parties that originally peddled them away from the top table . Now Sebastian Kurz's European counterparts are adopting elements of Sebastian Kurz's migration proposals in the hope that they will forestall something much more brutal . They assume that this remains possible . It may not be . ?",305,Austria,se-305-3,IN TERM,True,Sebastian Kurz,26,True

A GOLDEN late-summer light filters through the windows of the Café Landtmann. Bow-tied waiters move among towering hot-house plants. Officials huddle around a table. They are fretting about fragmentation: Europe's north is peeling away from its south; easterners feel like second-class citizens; outside powers are trying to divide and rule. This might be a scene from the final days of the Austro-Hungarian empire in 1918. In fact it is today, 100 years later. For once more the spectre of European fragmentation haunts Vienna.
It haunts other capitals, too. In Berlin, Angela Merkel urges her ministers to read ""The Sleepwalkers"", an account of the political failures that led to the first world war. Political Brussels is rediscovering Stefan Zweig's tales of post-Habsburg Austria. In Rome a populist government is preparing to battle the eu institutions over budget rules and to seed a new nationalist block in the European Parliament. Emmanuel Macron, France's liberal hope, is losing his sheen; his proposals for euro-zone reform have been diluted. Autocracy is gaining ground in Warsaw and Budapest. Meanwhile China, Russia, Turkey and America are interfering ever more in European affairs. The geopolitical centrifuge is spinning European states away from each other, like dancers at a ball.
Vienna is the pivot. Austria is two months into its six-month presidency ofthe eu Council under Sebastian Kurz, the darling of the continent's conservatives. To his critics he has cosied up to the far right by bringing them into his government, and indulged Islamophobia. To his fans, he is the smooth diplomat staking out a middle ground between liberalism and nationalism and building bridges between east and west. He will host Europe's leaders in Salzburg on September 20th and get them talking about the things pulling Europe apart: Brexit, the next eu budget, trade and immigration. ""We need to get everyone on board again,"" says Alexander Schallenberg, the co-ordinator of Austria's presidency.
It is also in Vienna that the memories ofthe old Habsburg multinational order reside. ""Our history shows how quickly things can change for the worse,"" cautions one Austrian intellectual. The empire once run from here had a larger budget and more power than today's eu, not least its own army and tax-raising powers, but both stand as triumphs of liberalism over nationalism. Ten languages were once spoken in the Habsburg parliament. Following its annexation of Bosnia, the empire was the first western European state to recognise Islam.
Like the eu, the Habsburg empire seemed to suspend history. Germans, Hungarians, Slavs and sizeable Muslim and Jewish populations mingled in cosmopolitan cities like Vienna and Prague, Trieste and Lviv. Paul Lendvai, a Hungarian-Austrian writer born in Budapest in 1929 recalls: ""My father always said peace was not having to show your passport."" The old order's full value became clear only after it collapsed, when the dark energy of them-and-us took hold and the region succumbed to petty hatreds, economic disintegration and the whims of outside powers.
One lesson above all lives on: do not take the loyalty of a multinational block for granted. The Habsburgs charmed their subjects by giving them relative freedom, material benefits and protection under the law from the whims of local barons. ""They created a situation where ordinary people could see their own interests in institutions of empire,"" explains Pieter Judson, a leading historian of the empire. But when tough times came with the start of the war, he explains, it turned out that these loyalties had been contingent: ""The state didn't provide what it promised to provide. There was no food and no fuel. Men went to the front, women to the factories and children were left on the streets. Loyal nations-the Ukrainians, the Serbs, the Czechs-were persecuted without foundation."" When the empire was dissolved after its defeat, it was not greatly mourned.
Today's eu is even weaker, fears Mr Judson: built on good living but without deeper roots. His home country, America, is a multinational, federal state that survives on common feeling. ""But as an American living in Europe I feel that the stakes of belonging to the eu are not understood at all.""
Hearts and minds
European leaders can learn from the weaknesses of Austria-Hungary. Europe's citizens today may have no affection for the bureaucracy, but like the subjects of the old empire they will tolerate it for as long as it generates wealth and preserves their freedoms. Yet complex institutions, second-rate European commissioners, wasteful policies like the common agricultural one and incompetent national governments across much of the continent all undermine that goal. To survive, the liberal European order, of which the eu is a pillar, must become leaner and more capable. Margrethe Vestager and Cecilia Malmström, the European commissioners taking on the digital giants and forging massive new trade deals for the union, are two of the better examples.
But the fate of Austria-Hungary also showed that multinational units cannot survive times of hardship without a sense of common purpose. Thanks to the rise of English, budget airlines, the internet and university exchanges, today's young Europeans live much more ""European"" lives than previous generations. But politics is not keeping up. Nurturing a clearer European identity is not just a romantic goal; it is the only way to make the project sustainable in the long term, hard though history shows this to be.
So Europe's leaders must face the balancing act that defeated their Viennese predecessors. They must show the pragmatism needed to keep their union afloat in the short term, while cultivating the vision needed to build common feeling in the long term. Mr Lendvai sums up the landscape: ""Social democracy is a shambles; liberals are arguing with each other; Christian Democrats are losing their Christian feeling."" They'd better get their act together, he reckons: ""For the ghosts of the past are coming back."" ?","What Europe can learn from the collapse of the Habsburg empire a century ago

Europe's parliament condemns a strongman, but sanctions are unlikely
SINCE coming to power in 2010, the government of Hungary's prime minister, Viktor Orban, has consistently disdained judicial independence, academic and media freedoms, and the rights of migrants. It has, in the view of many people, run roughshod over some of the core values of the European Union. So far, the eu has done nothing to rein it in. But on September 11th Judith Sargentini, a Dutch mep , made an attempt to do so, launching a detailed report that documents Mr Orban's transgressions, from widespread corruption to the forced sterilisation of Roma women in the past. She took to the floor of the European Parliament and called on her colleagues to choose: ""Will you ensure the value of this union is more than just words written on a piece of paper?""
Mr Orban, who bashes Brussels even as he accepts colossal subsidies from eu taxpayers, arrived at the debate both late and defiant. It was ""insulting"", he told the chamber, that they wanted to ""strip Hungary of the right to represent its interests in the European family where it belongs"". Supporters of the Hungarian populist, including Nigel Farage, the chief cheerleader for Brexit, came to his aid. But the following day meps voted with more than the required two-thirds majority to start the process of sanctioning Hungary under Article 7 of the eu treaty. In doing so they collectively stated that Mr Orban's government posed a ""systemic threat"" to democracy and the rule of law. Notably, another conservative leader often accused of excessive nationalism, Austria's Sebastian Kurz, told his party to vote against Hungary. Mr Kurz is a fellow-member of the European People's Party, the main right-of-centre political grouping at the parliament.
In theory, the vote could lead the eu to impose sanctions on Hungary and even to suspend its voting rights. But in order for this nuclear option to be used, the leaders of the Eu's other 27 members must unanimously agree. That is unlikely because Poland is currently facing the same procedure; and Poland and Hungary have vowed to support each other.
Mr Orban may not care all that much about the vote. His primary audience in Strasbourg was not meps but domestic voters, and the defeat will only serve to boost his popularity, as he presents himself as a valiant defender of the beleaguered Hungarian nation against the hostile external forces (that pay its bills). ""These debates help him to mobilise his own camp and will work much more at a domestic level,"" says Andras Biro-Nagy of Policy Solutions, a Budapest think-tank. The lead in the polls held by Mr Orban's Fidesz party is anyway unassailable. More than 50% of Hungar- ians back it against a fractured opposition.
The eu vote, though expected, infuriated Fidesz mps and meps, who said the punitive action was in revenge for Hungary's determination to stand firm against mass migration. The decision was an act of ""petty revenge"", said Peter Szijjarto, the foreign minister. The Sargentini report was full of ""unjustified, untruthful accusations"".
The criticisms have long been resolved with the European Commission, government officials argue. Mr Orban, they note, has won three elections in a row, partly by promising to crack down on migration and the ngos which support it. His team reckon that he is being punished for fulfilling his democratic mandate.","Hungary

BERLIN
Angela Merkel will step down as CDU party leader in December, after 18 years
If angela merkel felt emotional, she didn't show it. Her speech on October 29th consisted of numbered bullet points, about as dramatic as a shopping list. But she was declaring the end of her reign. In December Mrs Merkel will step down as head of the centre-right Christian Democratic Union (cdu), ending almost two decades as leader of Germany's most powerful political party. She also confirmed what many had long assumed: that this is her last term as German chancellor. She added that she was ""willing"" to remain chancellor until the end of the current parliament in 2021-clearly aware that, with her power ebbing, she may not be able to.
Mrs Merkel's announcement came a day after a regional election in the German state of Hesse. Her Christian Democrats won the most votes with 27%, and her close ally, Volker Bouffier, looks set to remain state premier. But it was still a devastating loss of support, down by more than 11 percentage points compared with 2013. The centre-left Social Democratic Party (spd) also lost around 11% of the vote, scoring only 20%. Surveys show that many in Hesse wanted to punish the central government in Berlin, where Mrs Merkel's conservative bloc governs in coalition with the spd. The coalition parties have spent much of this year distracted by infighting and undignified spats. Voters have had enough. ""It is a clear signal that this can't go on like this,"" the chancellor said.
After 13 years under Mrs Merkel as chancellor, Germany is ready for change. But at first glance it is not clear why. The economy is stronger than ever, with unemployment at an all-time low. The country has managed to deal well with the large influx of asylum-seekers in 2015 and 2016, and since then migrant arrivals have fallen dramatically. The issue of refugees barely featured in election campaigns in Hesse.
""The dissatisfaction is not about policies, but rather about how politics is carried out,"" says Thorsten Haas, of Berlin's Free University. The squabbles in Berlin play into feelings that politicians are out of touch and more interested in their own jobs than serving the country. Loyalties to the traditional big-tent parties have also weakened, and voters are less likely to vote according to affiliations to a trade union, the church or a particular social class. Politics has become more about identity and the debate between open versus closed- questions about which the centre-left Greens and the right-wing populist Alternative for Germany (AfD) are clear, explaining both parties' success. The cdu and spd, on the other hand, are both internally split on issues like migration. In Hesse the centre-right cdu lost roughly equal numbers of voters to the Greens and the AfD.
Mrs Merkel's successor will have to decide where to position the party. Keep to her centrist course and lose more voters to the AfD? Or head down a more conservative path and risk liberals migrating to the Greens? In December delegates at the CDU's party conference in Hamburg will answer that question by choosing a new leader, who will also probably be the party's next choice of chancellor.
Battle is joined
So far, there are three declared candidates. Friedrich Merz, a former leader of the parliamentary party, was one of Mrs Merkel's first victims on her way to the top. After she beat him for a key party post in 2002, he left politics to work in finance, later becoming chairman of the supervisory board of the German bit of BlackRock, an asset-management company. Socially conservative, a charismatic speaker and close to business, he has sniped at Mrs Merkel's government from the sidelines. It is hard to imagine she could last her full term with him as party leader, and he is the man to watch.
Another conservative hopeful is Jens Spahn, Germany's health minister. He is young, ambitious and an outspoken critic of Mrs Merkel's refugee policy, making him a tricky party leader for her. Popular with the right of the cdu, he likes to hang out with Austria's young conservative chancellor, Sebastian Kurz, and Donald Trump's outspoken ambassador to Berlin, Richard Grenell. His opinions go down less well with centrist party members and voters.
Mrs Merkel's preferred candidate is Annagret Kramp-Karrenbauer, whom she picked in February to be party general secretary, after a competent stint as premier of the state of Saarland (Germany's secondsmallest). She is seen as a centrist Merkel ally-not a plus for a party looking for change. But she also holds some more socially conservative positions than the chancellor. She could appeal to Germany's political centre, where elections have usually been won, though that could now be changing. However, she still needs to emerge from Mrs Merkel's shadow.
Whoever takes over, this week has produced bad news for the AfD. The chancellor has been a useful hate figure. ""Merkel muss weg"", or ""Merkel has to go"", has been a key slogan for years, and would have been a feature of AfD campaigns at three state elections in eastern Germany next year. A big worry for the AfD is that a more conservative cdu leader may lure back some disaffected voters.
Can Mrs Merkel carry on? That depends on whether she can work with the CDU's next party leader, and whether her spd coalition partners can-unlikely if the new CDU party leader is a right-winger. Meanwhile, outside Germany liberals are already mourning the upcoming loss of the ""leader of the free world""-never a title she liked. Germany's foreign policy is more than just one person. But as a seasoned negotiator able to bang heads together, Mrs Merkel will be greatly missed. ?","Germany

IT WAS LIKE watching paint dry, or other people's children play baseball. Last month Gert Raudsep, an Estonian actor, spent two hours on prime-time television reading out the text of a unmigration agreement. Estonia's government was tottering over whether to pull out of the Global Compact for Safe, Orderly and Regular Migration, to give it its full name. So Mr Raudsep was invited to present the source of the discord to worried viewers. Thoughts of weary migrants from Africa and Latin America kept him going, he said. ""But my eyes got a bit tired.""
Mr Raudsep's recital made for dull viewing because the compact is a dull document. Its 23 ""objectives"" are peppered with vague declarations, platitudes and split differences. Partly in the spirit of other global agreements like the Paris climate deal, it encourages states to co-operate on tricky cross-border matters without forcing them to do anything. It urges governments to treat migrants properly, but also to work together on sending them home when necessary. At best it helps build the trust between ""sending"" and ""receiving"" countries that is the foundation of any meaningful international migration policy.
None of this has prevented European governments from melting down over it. In the end Estonia resolved its row; it will join more than 180 other countries in Marrakesh on December 10th-11th to adopt the compact. But so far at least ten others, including seven from Europe, have followed the lead of Donald Trump and pulled out of a deal that they helped negotiate. The agreement is agitating parliaments, sparking protests and splintering coalitions; Belgium's is on the verge of collapse. More withdrawals may follow.
Why the fuss? The text explicitly states that governments retain the sovereign right to make immigration policy. But critics say that cannot be trusted. Although the compact is not legally binding, they argue it is ""softlaw"" that might one day be used to press governments into hard commitments, such as acknowledging a ""human right"" to migration or expanding the grounds for asylum.
This is, largely, codswallop. The compact is hardly perfect; the drafters should have refrained from urging governments to ""educate"" journalists on migration, for example, or to hold ""culinary festivals"" to celebrate multiculturalism. Yet until cynical politicians started paying attention, the main charge the compact faced was toothlessness. Most of the political arguments against it emerged after governments had already approved the draftin July.
That suggests other forces are at work. In Slovakia, the compact stirred passions only after the speaker of parliament, embroiled in a plagiarism scandal, sought a way to change the subject. The government has since withdrawn from the compact, which led the foreign minister, a former president of the UN General Assembly, to offer his resignation. In Germany a row over the compact, triggered by the right-wing Alternative for Germany (AFD), has forced the candidates running to succeed Angela Merkel as leader of the Christian Democratic Union to declare themselves: for or against? (The party chooses her successor on December 7th.) Now the AFD boasts, correctly, that its ideas have infiltrated the mainstream.
As has become depressingly routine in Europe, the row over the UN compact has little to do with its ostensible target and everything to do with the smouldering embers of a culture war that the drastic reduction in illegal immigration since the surge of 2015 has failed to extinguish. (A pointless spat over border controls nearly destroyed Mrs Merkel's coalition earlier this year.) Immigration remains a potent topic for the right; the trouble in Belgium started when the country's largest party, the nationalist New Flemish Alliance, began a social-media campaign against the compact, replete with imagery of women in niqabs and the like (it later apologised). But in the absence of a genuine crisis to mobilise support, fake problems must be confected. The UN compact is a sitting duck. There is no downside to hammering a multilateral agreement on a controversial subject negotiated by obscure officials in air-conditioned rooms abroad. That it was agreed by governments in plain sight, with parliamentarians invited to participate, is by-the-by.
Displacement activity
In Berlin, where outrage over the compact took the establishment by surprise, some say the government should have forcefully made the case for it as soon as it was agreed. Instead, caught on the back foot, Mrs Merkel and other defenders of the deal are locked into an awkward argument: that fears about the compact are overblown because it is not legally binding, but that it is also an important tool for managing migration. Yet aside from Mrs Merkel's perennial reluctance to lead rather than react to debates, arguing for the deal earlier would simply have given opponents a bigger target and more time to shoot at it. A more sobering conclusion is that, for now, it has become impossible to have a level-headed conversation about managing migration in Europe.
UN insiders profess themselves frustrated but unbowed by the string of withdrawals. (Many blame Sebastian Kurz, the Austrian chancellor, whose decision in October to pull out inspired several others to follow.) Although the idea for the compact was drawn up just after Europe's refugee crisis of 2015-16-indeed, partly at the request of panicked European leaders-its provisions are global. Europe's navel-gazing arguments have little bearing on the lot of Bangladeshi workers in the Gulf or Zimbabweans in South Africa.
True enough. But Europe's rejectionist governments are shooting themselves in the foot nonetheless. Even a hard-headed policy of tough border controls, swiftreturn of illegal immigrants and encouraging would-be migrants to stay home obliges governments to work with others, if only to strike grubby repatriation deals. Building trust by sticking to international commitments lays the foundations for that. That so many governments are choosing to do precisely the opposite does not inspire hope that Europe is groping towards a more sensible migration policy.","European governments are melting down over an inoffensive migration agreement
IT WAS LIKE watching paint dry, or other people's children play baseball. Last month Gert Raudsep, an Estonian actor, spent two hours on prime-time television reading out the text of a unmigration agreement. Estonia's government was tottering over whether to pull out of the Global Compact for Safe, Orderly and Regular Migration, to give it its full name. So Mr Raudsep was invited to present the source of the discord to worried viewers. Thoughts of weary migrants from Africa and Latin America kept him going, he said. ""But my eyes got a bit tired.""
Mr Raudsep's recital made for dull viewing because the compact is a dull document. Its 23 ""objectives"" are peppered with vague declarations, platitudes and split differences. Partly in the spirit of other global agreements like the Paris climate deal, it encourages states to co-operate on tricky cross-border matters without forcing them to do anything. It urges governments to treat migrants properly, but also to work together on sending them home when necessary. At best it helps build the trust between ""sending"" and ""receiving"" countries that is the foundation of any meaningful international migration policy.

In the end Estonia resolved its row; it will join more than 180 other countries in Marrakesh on December 10th-11th to adopt the compact.

On a freezing morning in Vienna in December 2017, Charlemagne heard a tempting case for what might be called ""the hug strategy"". He was drinking coffee with an ally of Sebastian Kurz, the young leader of the centre-right Austrian People's Party who was hours from a coalition deal with the hard-right Austrian Freedom Party (fpö). ""He has grown up,"" said the Kurz-ite of Heinz-Christian Strache, the fpö's leader, adding that, in any case, Mr Kurz would be able to manage his new ally. Having already edged towards some fpö positions and won back some of its supporters, the incoming chancellor would render his coalition partner irrelevant in government and thus contain the hard-right while governing pragmatically. It all sounded very clever.
It proved otherwise. Mr Kurz's big hug failed to stifle Mr Strache. At recent rallies in the South Tyrol and Linz your columnist watched the vulpine vice-chancellor charge in to the boisterous oomph of Johann Strauss's Radetzky March before unveiling his latest designs: Austrian passports for German-speakers in northern Italy, mosque closures, an end to the ""population replacement"" of white Europeans by immigrants. Support for the fpö remained high and stable at around 25%. Its ministers undermined the independence of Austria's state broadcaster and attacked the rights of asylum-seekers. Karin Kneissl, the FPö-backed foreign minister, danced with Vladimir Putin at her wedding. Some containment this was turning out to be.
On May 17th it all came crashing down. Two German newspapers published a video secretly filmed in a villa on the Spanish island of Ibiza in the summer of 2017. In it, a woman posing as the niece of a Russian oligarch suggested to Mr Strache that her uncle take over the Kronen Zeitung, Austria's largest newspaper, and use it to pump out pro-FPÖ messages in return for government contracts. The fpö leader responded enthusiastically and expressed admiration for how Viktor Orban, Hungary's authoritarian prime minister, had crushed the independent press in his country. The scandal-dubbed ""Ibizagate""-prompted a tearful Mr Strache to announce his resignation and a chastened Mr Kurz to dissolve the alliance. ""Enough is enough,"" the chancellor said. Yet he had hardly been ignorant of the risks of the coalition from the start. He merely thought he could manage them.
The sorry tale is part of a bigger saga. All over Europe populist nationalists like Mr Strache are challenging moderate politicians, many of whom are adopting a version of the hug strategy by emulating some of the populists' language and policies, or bringing them into government, or both as in Austria. In Bavaria's state election campaign last autumn the conservative Christian Social Union tilted right on migration and picked fights with Angela Merkel's moderate Christian Democrat Union. Ahead of Sweden's election in September the previously liberal-conservative Moderates lambasted multiculturalism and did deals with the hard-right Sweden Democrats in local government. Spain's centre-right People's Party formed a regional government with the nationalist Vox party in January and aped its hardline positions on Catalan autonomy. In subsequent elections the three mainstream parties fell to their lowest results since 1950, 2002 and 1979 respectively.
Elsewhere the cost has, as in Mr Kurz's case, been less electoral than reputational and ideological. Britain's Conservatives vanquished the anti-EU United Kingdom Independence Party by appropriating its main policy (Brexit) but are now tearing themselves apart. In Denmark the centre-right Venstre's rightward shift (allowing police to confiscate jewellery and other valuables from arriving asylum-seekers, for example) and informal collaboration with the hard-right Danish People's Party has pushed the country's entire political contest in that direction. Manfred Weber, the centre-right candidate to be president of the European Commission, has long hugged Mr Orban in the hope of moderating him. This has emboldened the Hungarian leader, toxified Mr Weber and may impede him from marshalling the broad mainstream coalition that he needs in the European Parliament after this week's elections- unless, that is, he relies on votes from the hard-right.
A Faustian embrace
Political scientists who have studied such things could have warned of the dangers. Pontus Odmalm and Eve Hepburn, for example, have used the examples of British, French, Finnish, Danish and Dutch politics from 2002 to 2015 to chart the effects of mainstream parties moving towards populist positions on immigration. Having expected that these shifts would dent support for the populist parties, they found no such effect. Mainstream parties moving right, they hypothesise, may legitimise extreme parties and push them into yet more extreme positions-creating a bidding war that mainstreamers cannot win. This difference applies even if the outsiders are brought into government. Studying the effects of hard-right parties on qualitative measures of transparency, individual liberties, rule of law and minority rights in 30 European countries from 1990 to 2012, Robert Huber and Christian Schimpf showed that the presence of anti-system populists in opposition can be good for democracy, because they act like ""drunken guests"" at a dinner party and blurt out awkward truths. But they also found that there is ""a substantial negative effect on democratic quality"" when they enter government. Ibizagate should have come as no surprise to Mr Kurz.
But if this is not enough, Europe's moderates may be about to get another big dose of evidence. The European Parliament elections will probably see the centre-right bloc, many of whose member parties have pursued some version of the hug strategy, lose more seats than any other group. The right-wingers, some of them emboldened by roles in coalitions at national and regional levels, are expected be among the main winners. If so, it will be yet more proof that the hugs don't work.","Cosying up to populists rarely ends well for political moderates

The new parliament will be much more fragmented than the old one, thanks to a strong showing by green and liberal parties.

Greece's prime minister, Alexis Tsipras, said he would call a snap election after his leftwing Syriza party flopped in the Euro polls. In Austria, Sebastian Kurz lost a vote of confidence thanks to the break-up of his coalition with the hard-right fpö, so a fresh election will be held there, too.

Theresa May said she would resign as Britain's prime minister, after repeatedly failing to deliver Brexit. The 12-week-old Brexit Party won the most votes of any party at the European elections in Britain. The anti-Brexit Liberal Democrats and Greens won more votes than the Brexit Party but fewer seats. The traditional parties of government, the Conservatives and Labour, did miserably.
Britain's Labour Party expelled Alastair Campbell, a former adviser to Tony Blair, for backing the Liberal Democrats in the European elections. Party members who make antiSemitic comments have seldom been dumped so swiftly. Several other prominent Labourites also backed other parties, mostly over Brexit.

Homophobic and transphobic acts are to be punished under existing laws banning racial discrimination until Congress passes a bill. Brazil legalised same-sex marriage in 2013, but at least 420 gay people are thought to have been murdered last year.
Mexico charged Emilio Lozoya Austin, a former head of Pemex, the state-run oil company, with fraud. It is the first big case brought by the government of Andrés Manuel López Obrador, whose campaign last year promised to crack down on corruption.
All of the top leaders of Amnesty International, a human-rights group, offered to resign after an internal review uncovered a ""toxic"" workplace culture, including reports of bullying.
Back to the polls!
The Israeli Knesset voted to hold a fresh election in September, five months after a poll in April, as talks led by Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu, to put together a new coalition government failed. The sticking point was an attempt to end the exemption from the military draft for ultra-Orthodox Jews, which their parties refused to countenance. Mr Netanyahu pushed for a new election rather than let another party try to form a government. It is the first time in Israel that a governing majority has not been formed after an election.
The Syrian regime of Bashar al-Assad pounded Idlib province, the last rebel-held stronghold. Scores of civilians have died in the bombardment, which began last month. Some 300,000 have fled.
Donald Trump declared a national emergency over tensions with Iran in order to push through the sale of $8bn-worth of weapons to Saudi Arabia, Iran's regional rival. By declaring the emergency, Mr Trump was able to bypass Congress, which has criticised Saudi Arabia's conduct of the war in Yemen. Mr Trump said he is not seeking regime change in Iran-unlike his national-security adviser, John Bolton.
Cyril Ramaphosa named a new, smaller cabinet following his re-election as South Africa's president. Half the appointments were women and the new intake was generally taken as a sign that Mr Ramaphosa is serious about cracking down on corruption. They will all have to sign performance agreements.
The end of Mueller's time
Robert Mueller, who led the Department of Justice's investigation into Russian meddling in the election of 2016, gave a rare public statement. He explained that because the department works for the president, indicting Donald Trump was ""unconstitutional"" and ""not an option we could consider"". He also suggested that he has nothing to say beyond what is already in his report.
America's Supreme Court rejected a law in Indiana that would have banned abortions sought because of the fetus's sex or disability. However, it upheld Indiana's requirement that aborted fetuses be buried or cremated. Louisiana passed a bill banning abortions if a fetal heartbeat is detected. The Democratic governor has said he will sign it. Both pro-life and pro-choice activists expect a big battle over abortion during next year's presidential campaign.
America laid fresh charges against Julian Assange, this time for being ""complicit with"" Chelsea Manning in leaking hundreds of thousands of sensitive documents, starting in 2009. Mr Assange, who is in a British prison for jumping bail and is too ill to attend court, has already been accused by the Americans of abetting the hacking of a government computer.

On a state visit to Japan, Donald Trump met the new emperor and attended a sumowrestling tournament, where he presented a trophy. He startled his hosts by saying that North Korea's recent missile tests did not bother him and didn't violate un resolutions. Shinzo Abe, Japan's prime minister, called the missile tests ""extremely regrettable"".
John Bolton, Mr Trump's national security adviser, enraged China by meeting his Taiwanese counterpart in Washington. It was the first meeting between the top national-security officials from both countries since 1979, when America ended formal relations. China says Taiwan is part of its territory.
After weeks of political tumult, Peter O'Neill bowed to pressure and resigned as prime minister of Papua New Guinea. He was replaced by James Marape, a former ally who recently stepped down as finance minister. Mr O'Neill had faced mounting opposition to energy deals with foreign companies, including Total and ExxonMobil. Many locals complained that they had been overlooked in the process. 1","At elections for the European Parliament , a predicted surge by populists and nationalists failed to materialise , though such parties gained seats in Italy and Britain . The new parliament will be much more fragmented than the old one , thanks to a strong showing by green and liberal parties . The traditional main groupings , the centre - right European People 's Party and the centre - left Socialists and Democrats , both lost ground , falling well below a combined majority of the chamber for the first time . 
 Greece 's prime minister , Alexis Tsipras , said he would call a snap election after his leftwing Syriza party flopped in the Euro polls . In Austria , Sebastian Kurz lost a vote of confidence thanks to the break - up of Sebastian Kurz's coalition with the hard - right fpö , so a fresh election will be held there , too .

 Romania 's ruling party did terribly in the European elections . The next day its leader , Liviu Dragnea , was jailed for corruption . 
 Theresa May said she would resign as Britain 's prime minister , after repeatedly failing to deliver Brexit . The 12 - week - old Brexit Party won the most votes of any party at the European elections in Britain . The anti - Brexit Liberal Democrats and Greens won more votes than the Brexit Party but fewer seats . The traditional parties of government , the Conservatives and Labour , did miserably . 
 Britain 's Labour Party expelled Alastair Campbell , a former adviser to Tony Blair , for backing the Liberal Democrats in the European elections . Party members who make antiSemitic comments have seldom been dumped so swiftly . Several other prominent Labourites also backed other parties , mostly over Brexit .

Across Europe, the elections have shaken up domestic politics, too
IT WILL TAKE weeks for the results of the European elections to take effect; the parliament does not convene until July. But in some countries events moved swiftly. Within days of the vote a chancellor was forced from office, a snap election called, a de facto leader sent to prison and some party chiefs left fighting to survive.
The ruling Christian Democratic Union (CDU) and its Bavarian ally took first place in Germany, but with a record low score of 29%. The Greens surged into second place with over 20% of the vote. A poor national result for the far-right Alternative for Germany masked a strong showing in the country's east, where the party came first in two of three states that will hold elections in the autumn. The biggest losers were the Social Democrats (SPD), the CDU's coalition partner, who slumped to 16% and lost a separate election in the city-state of Bremen for the first time in over 70 years.
Germany's coalition is tattered but holding, for now. Yet a febrile mood has taken hold inside the ruling parties. Andrea Nahles, the embattled SPD chairwoman, has decided to flush out any internal foes by putting her leadership of the parliamentary group up for early election. But Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer, leader of the CDU, managed to distract from the SPD's woes by appearing to suggest that YouTube commentators should be subject to regulation during election campaigns, exposing her to charges (which she denied) of opposing free speech. Inside the CDU some wonder if the gaffe-prone Ms KrampKarrenbauer has what it takes to succeed Angela Merkel, her mentor, as chancellor.
Elsewhere it was a mixed night for governing parties. The results in Italy reversed the roles of junior and senior partner in western Europe's only populist government. Matteo Salvini's nationalist Northern League doubled its tally from last year's general election to 34% of the vote; the anti-establishment Five Star Movement (M5S) crashed from 32% to 17%. The opposition centre-left Democratic Party beat expectations to take second, with 23%.
The League's triumph could tempt Mr Salvini, the deputy prime minister, to force an election and dump the M5S in favour of a coalition with other right-wing parties. But after the result he said that his loyalty to the existing arrangement had ""never been in question"". The bigger doubts are over the M5S. With the whip firmly in his hand, Mr Salvini has called for measures at which the MSS has balked, including immigration controls, infrastructure schemes and more autonomy for Italy's rich north. Alarmingly for Brussels, the League leader also urged a tax-cutting stimulus. Italy already risks breaching euro-area budget-deficit limits, and the European Commission is reportedly preparing to begin disciplinary proceedings. But a defiant Mr Salvini said he had been given ""a mandate calmly to revisit old and outdated parameters"".
In Austria the election provided only brief respite for Sebastian Kurz, the young head of the ruling conservative People's Party (ÖVP), amid a scandal that has shattered his government. On May 18th Mr Kurz ejected his coalition partner, the far-right Freedom Party, after a tape from 2017 surfaced showing its leader, Heinz-Christian Strache, promising government contracts to a woman he believed was related to a Russian oligarch. Perhaps benefiting from disillusionment with Mr Strache's party, the ÖVP went on to win a record 35% of the vote. But one day later Mr Kurz's government was toppled in a confidence vote. A caretaker government will take office before elections in September, in which Mr Kurz will hope to resume where he left off.
Not as bad as it seemed
Emmanuel Macron, the French president, will have been disappointed to lose to Marine Le Pen's National Rally (formerly the National Front), which took 23% of the vote. Yet the outcome was far from devastating. Despite 28 weeks of gilets jaunes (yellow jackets) protests, and Ms Le Pen's efforts to turn the election into a referendum on Mr Macron, she ended up with a slightly lower score than in 2014. Less than a percentage point separated the two lists.
Perhaps most importantly, the result confirmed the upending of politics that Mr Macron brought about when he seized the presidency in 2017 with a new party, En Marche. The mainstream parties on the left (Socialists) and right (Republicans) together scored less than 15%. The only impressive gains came from the Greens, who took 13%. Mr Macron will now seek to reboot his presidency. He promises that policymaking will become more ""human"", but also to stick to reform plans for pensions, unemployment benefits and the public sector.
Nationalists struggled in the Nordics, especially Sweden and Denmark, against socialists and liberals. In the Netherlands the Labour Party secured a surprise win on the back of an energetic campaign by Frans Timmermans, a candidate to run the European Commission. But hard-right Flemish separatists did well in a general election in Belgium, held on the same day.
In Poland the ruling populist Law and Justice (PÍS) party won 45% of the vote, putting it in good stead to win a general election due in the autumn. The European Coalition, an ad hoc group of anti-PIS parties led by the centrist Civic Platform (PO), will struggle to remain united after taking a disappointing 38%. With other parties in trouble, the PIS-PO rivalry will continue to dominate Polish politics. But PIS, under its leader Jaroslaw Kaczynski, is setting the agenda with generous handouts and popular slogans. PO and others are struggling to find a coherent pitch to voters.
It was a dreadful election for Liviu Dragnea, head of Romania's ruling Social Democrats (PSD). Voters at home and abroad turned out in droves against a government widely perceived as corrupt. The PSD took just 23% of the vote, and 80% of Romanians backed a referendum opposing the government's judicial reforms. A day after this drubbing Mr Dragnea, the architect of laws designed to reduce penalties for corruption that sparked huge protests, was handed a three-and-a-half-year prison sentence for abuse of office. With Mr Dragnea's career surely over, the opposition will now seek to turf his party from office.
Centrists enjoyed modest success elsewhere in central Europe. In Slovakia a coalition backed by Zuzana Caputova, a liberal who won March's presidential election, came first. Viktor Orban's Fidesz won half the vote in Hungary, though two small opposition parties did better than expected.
Beyond MEPS, Spaniards also chose 12 regional governments and 8,131 mayors. A month after winning a general election, Pedro Sánchez's Socialists took 33% of the vote in the European election, confirming them as comfortably the largest party. The results were also a relief for Pablo Casado, the new leader of the conservative People's Party (pp). After a drubbing in the general election Mr Casado tacked towards the centre, winning 20% and hanging on to Madrid's regional government. Other parties struggled. Ciudadanos, a centre-right outfit, slid to 12%. The far left and right faded. The two wings of the Catalan separatist movement secured 49% of the vote in the region. But legal troubles may prevent their two MEPS from taking up their seats.
Mr Sánchez still needs to build a parliamentary majority. Albert Rivera, Ciudadanos's leader, will face pressure to stop his veto of deals with the Socialists in protest at their conciliatory approach to the Catalan problem. Weeks of haggling lie ahead.
The next to go?
Alexis Tsipras, Greece's prime minister, called a snap election for July after his leftwing Syriza party suffered a crushing defeat at the hands of the centre-right New Democracy (ND). Nationalist voters punished Syriza for Mr Tsipras's biggest achievement: resolving a 28-year dispute over the name of Greece's northern neighbour, now known as North Macedonia.
And looks set to win the general election. That will reassure other euro-zone governments worried about Greece sticking to its post-bail-out reform plan, after Syriza embarked on a burst of pre-election spending. But Kyriakos Mitsotakis, ND's leader, may struggle to form a coalition. And Mr Tsipras is unlikely to go into docile opposition.","The European Parliament elections ( 2 )

""SCHMIDT AND Giscard supported each other on every point Swhich came up during this European Council,"" scribbled Roy Jenkins in his diary in 1977. The former British home secretary had just become president of the European Commission, the EU's executive. He was struck by the extent to which West Germany (led by by Helmut Schmidt) and France (led by Valéry Giscard d'Estaing) looked out for each other. Back in those days Europe's two central powers sorted out their differences in private, and then used their combined weight to set the agenda for the entire club.
Today things work differently. On many policy subjects, France and Germany are now openly divided. The former wants to cut short the endless Brexit negotiations; the latter is willing to prolong them. France backs the European Intervention Initiative, a European military force willing to act even when some EU states disagree; Germany is keener on Permanent Structured Co-operation, a broader but less dynamic forum for EU security co-ordination. France wants to integrate the euro zone further, to prepare it for the next crisis; Germany frets about moral hazard.
The more the EU gains members, shrinks in relative global weight and faces ever-tougher circumstances, the more it struggles to present a common front. The EU summit starting on June 20th, which will focus on allocating the union's big jobs, will illustrate that truth. The choice of president for the next European Commission will be the main bone of contention. Angela Merkel is supporting Manfred Weber, a Bavarian candidate whom her European People's Party (EPP), the main centre-right grouping, backs. Emmanuel Macron, France's liberal president, wants to block him and appoint instead Michel Barnier, a Frenchman and the lead Brexit negotiator, who is also in the EPP, or perhaps Margrethe Vestager, the EU's formidable Danish competition commissioner who hails from his own liberal group.
The geometry of European power is becoming messy. For one thing there are more splits: the old centre-right and centre-left families no longer span Europe. At the European Parliament election in May the conservatives were most successful in central and south-eastern Europe (eight of the nine centre-right governments are now from east of the Rhine). The social democrats are rooted in Iberia and Scandinavia. Meanwhile, the newly powerful liberal and green groupings in the parliament are strongest in Europe's north and west while its right-wing populists are most successful in its east and south. In these circumstances, and with the FrancoGerman engine stalling, three smaller countries are becoming more influential: Spain, the Netherlands and Austria.
Spain under Pedro Sánchez, the recently elected centre-left prime minister, is a natural ally to Emmanuel Macron's France. He hopes to make Spain a new third partner in the Franco-German alliance. Madrid has particularly good relations with other southern European countries like Italy and Greece, but also makes a good interlocutor for Germany. ""Merkel was quite happy when she realised she could speak to a Spanish prime minister directly,"" says Miguel Otero-Iglesias, a Spanish foreign policy analyst, of Mr Sánchez's European focus and fluent English. The Netherlands under Mark Rutte, meanwhile, has close links with both Mrs Merkel (as fellow supporters of hawkish euro-zone policies) and with Mr Macron (like Mr Rutte a liberal committed to speedy action on climate change). The Netherlands has made itself influential by marshalling a ""Hanseatic"" alliance against the fiscal integration that the likes of Mr Macron and Mr Sánchez want. In this it has allies across Scandinavian and Baltic Europe. Lastly there is Austria. The government in Vienna recently collapsed over a corruption scandal but the ousted chancellor, Sebastian Kurz, has emerged relatively unscathed and looks likely to win power again in new elections in September. Under his leadership, the small Alpine republic has become a potent voice in European debates on immigration and a broker of compromises between the EU's liberal western states and its conservative-dominated eastern ones.
The three countries have similarities. All have close links with France and Germany; all can marshal coalitions of like- minded states in their parts of Europe: all have modernising leaders with experiences of arduous coalition-building at home. One could call them ""the Habsburgs"", as all were at one time controlled by that dynasty which, like its successors in Madrid, The Hague and Vienna, played off other powers at Europe's core against each another.
One illustration of the new mechanics came with the recent debate in the EU about cutting carbon emissions to zero by 2050. Germany was at first unwilling, but the Netherlands and Spain formed an alliance with France. That pushed Germany towards the goal. Austria then swung in, followed by some central European states like Slovenia. Together, the Habsburg states spread a measure initially backed by just eight EU states to at least 18 of them.
A new geometry
Spain, the Netherlands and Austria are too disparate to act as a bloc. Instead, individually or in various combinations, they can help the French and the Germans build new coalitions. Such is today's fluid European politics, where coalitions coalesce, take effect, then dissolve again. Whether or not the three will remain influential is uncertain. Others, for instance a potentially more pro-European Poland, could take their place. But the old world of a dominant Franco-German bloc is certainly over. A political scientist, Gilles Finchelstein, has a term for this. Once, he argues, European politics was made up of ""solid"" power blocs. Then after the fall of the Berlin Wall they became ""liquid"" with the rise of the swing voter and a less predictable European political landscape. Today, he concludes, is the ""gaseous era"" in which political coalitions come together for brief periods like clouds of smoke, then are blown apart again. In the years to come, such gaseous constellations will define Europe's politics in the coming years.","Political alliances in Europe are less solid than ever before

Emmanuel Macron , France 's liberal president , wants to block him and appoint instead Michel Barnier , a Frenchman and the lead Brexit negotiator , who is also in the EPP , or perhaps Margrethe Vestager , the EU 's formidable Danish competition commissioner who hails from his own liberal group . 
 The geometry of European power is becoming messy . For one thing there are more splits : the old centre - right and centre - left families no longer span Europe . At the European Parliament election in May the conservatives were most successful in central and south - eastern Europe ( eight of the nine centre - right governments are now from east of the Rhine ) . The social democrats are rooted in Iberia and Scandinavia . Meanwhile , the newly powerful liberal and green groupings in the parliament are strongest in Europe 's north and west while its right - wing populists are most successful in its east and south . In these circumstances , and with the FrancoGerman engine stalling , three smaller countries are becoming more influential : Spain , the Netherlands and Austria . 
 Spain under Pedro Sánchez , the recently elected centre - left prime minister , is a natural ally to Emmanuel Macron 's France . He hopes to make Spain a new third partner in the Franco - German alliance . Madrid has particularly good relations with other southern European countries like Italy and Greece , but also makes a good interlocutor for Germany . "" Merkel was quite happy when she realised she could speak to a Spanish prime minister directly , "" says Miguel Otero - Iglesias , a Spanish foreign policy analyst , of Mr Sánchez 's European focus and fluent English . The Netherlands under Mark Rutte , meanwhile , has close links with both Mrs Merkel ( as fellow supporters of hawkish euro - zone policies ) and with Mr Macron ( like Mr Rutte a liberal committed to speedy action on climate change ) . The Netherlands has made itself influential by marshalling a "" Hanseatic "" alliance against the fiscal integration that the likes of Mr Macron and Mr Sánchez want . In this it has allies across Scandinavian and Baltic Europe . Lastly there is Austria . The government in Vienna recently collapsed over a corruption scandal but Sebastian Kurz , has emerged relatively unscathed and looks likely to win power again in new elections in September . Under Sebastian Kurz's leadership , the small Alpine republic has become a potent voice in European debates on immigration and a broker of compromises between the EU 's liberal western states and its conservative - dominated eastern ones . 
 The three countries have similarities . All have close links with France and Germany ; all can marshal coalitions of like- minded states in their parts of Europe : all have modernising leaders with experiences of arduous coalition - building at home . One could call them "" the Habsburgs "" , as all were at one time controlled by that dynasty which , like its successors in Madrid , The Hague and Vienna , played off other powers at Europe 's core against each another . 
 One illustration of the new mechanics came with the recent debate in the EU about cutting carbon emissions to zero by 2050 . Germany was at first unwilling , but the Netherlands and Spain formed an alliance with France . That pushed Germany towards the goal . Austria then swung in , followed by some central European states like Slovenia . Together , the Habsburg states spread a measure initially backed by just eight EU states to at least 18 of them . 
 A new geometry 
 Spain , the Netherlands and Austria are too disparate to act as a bloc . Instead , individually or in various combinations , they can help the French and the Germans build new coalitions . Such is today 's fluid European politics , where coalitions coalesce , take effect , then dissolve again . Whether or not the three will remain influential is uncertain . Others , for instance a potentially more pro - European Poland , could take their place . But the old world of a dominant Franco - German bloc is certainly over . A political scientist , Gilles Finchelstein , has a term for this . Once , he argues , European politics was made up of "" solid "" power blocs . Then after the fall of the Berlin Wall they became "" liquid "" with the rise of the swing voter and a less predictable European political landscape . Today , he concludes , is the "" gaseous era "" in which political coalitions come together for brief periods like clouds of smoke , then are blown apart again . In the years to come , such gaseous constellations will define Europe 's politics in the coming years .",305,Austria,se-305-3,POST TERM,True,"the ousted chancellor , Sebastian Kurz",2,True

BADEN BEI WIEN
Four months ago he faced crisis. Now he looks like winning again
THE CAMERAS flash, the crowd cheers, the music blares. Sebastian Kurz has finally arrived. Teenagers and grandmothers swarm for selfies with the young leader of Austria's conservative People's Party (ÖVP). The upper stories on the handsome Theaterplatz, in Baden bei Wien, a spa town south of Vienna, are decked with banners in the ÖVP's regulation turquoise. Someone has baked a cake. The atmosphere is somewhere between a supercharged summer fete and a heavyweight bout in Vegas.
On September 29th the ÖVP is set to win a second consecutive election for the first time since the 1960s. As in 2017 its victory will belong in large part to Mr Kurz; the 33year-old is Austria's most popular party leader by far. Detested by many urban liberals, he enjoys a star following in much of the rest of the country. ""He's the only guy who wants to make a change,"" says Konrad Mylius, one of several teenage volunteers at the Baden rally sporting turquoise ""Wir für Kurz"" (""We're for Kurz"") T-shirts.
It is all the more remarkable given that it is only four months since the spectacular implosion of Mr Kurz's government, a coalition with the right-wing Freedom Party (FPÖ). In May two German newspapers published footage of Heinz-Christian Strache, FPÖ leader and vice-chancellor, and an aide promising state contracts to a woman posing as the niece of a Russian oligarch in exchange for favourable press coverage. The video, filmed during a boozy evening at an Ibiza villa five months before Mr Strache entered government, was dynamite. A furious Mr Kurz ejected the FPÖ, and soon afterwards became the first Austrian chancellor to lose a confidence vote.
Yet he has shrugged it all off. True, the culprits were not in his party. But it was Mr Kurz who, to the consternation of Austria's European partners, invited the FPÖ, a party with Nazi roots, to join him in government in 2017. Even before Ibizagate the FPÖ had proved a troublesome partner. Herbert Kickl, the interior minister and an FPÖ ideologue, ordered a raid on a domestic intelligence agency. The government's collapse seemed to vindicate those who warned about the dangers of embracing the far right. Yet not only is Mr Kurz sure to be reinstalled as chancellor, he may well pick up where he left off with the FPÖ.
Understanding how that is possible requires familiarity with the weariness that had descended on Austrian politics before Mr Kurz burst on to the scene. He built his brand in two ways. First, by spotting the gap in the centre-right market for a harder line on refugees. Having previously presented a liberal face on migration, during the 2015-16 crisis Mr Kurz, then foreign minister, began to talk tough on borders and asylum, and worked with Balkan governments to close migrant routes. Many voters lapped it up, though others feared Mr Kurz was normalising the far right.
His second trick was to address Austrians' appetite for change. By 2017 endless ""grand coalitions"" between the ÖVP and the Social Democrats (SPÖ) had visibly run their course; two-thirds of voters said the country was on the wrong track. Mr Kurz took over the leadership of his ailing party, centralising control and instantly catapulting it from third to first place in the polls. Since then he has retained the aura of the outsider. By convincing voters that only a coalition with the FPÖ could unleash his reformist energy, he assembled his government without much protest. ""The work we did as a coalition was very successful,"" he tells The Economist in Baden, offering tax cuts and debt reduction as examples.
Mr Kurz has brushed off recent miniscandals over election spending and destroyed hard drives. Forming a government will be a bigger test. There are three main options: a grand coalition; a re-run of the partnership with the FPÖ, which has emerged mostly unscathed from Ibizagate (although Mr Kurz will not work with Mr Kickl); or a dirndl government (so-called for the colours of a traditional dress) with the Greens and the liberal Neos, who may between them command 20% of the vote.
Each constellation presents problems. Reverting to a grand coalition would torpedo Mr Kurz's reputation for disruption. A dirndl government would be tested by strains on migration and welfare. And to team up with the FPÖ is to be exposed to its penchant for drama and scandal; all four governments the party has belonged to have collapsed in ignominy. Thomas Hofer, a political analyst, compares Mr Kurz's predicament to ""a choice between the plague, cholera and Ebola"". The comeback kid's biggest challenge may lie ahead.","Austria

BUDAPEST, ROME AND VIENNA
After a series of reverses they are down, though certainly not out
LOOK BACK a year, and remember how disquieting European politics seemed. Matteo Salvini, by far the most popular politician in Italy, and France's equally xenophobic Marine Le Pen had just teamed up with Steve Bannon, Donald Trump's former strategist, as part of what Mr Bannon called The Movement. This alliance of nativist parties of the right, soon to acquire a ""gladiator school"" based in a monastery near Rome, intended to sweep the forthcoming European elections and tilt the continent's politics firmly away from the liberal centre ground. They had their difficulties, of course. The Eurosceptic and anti-migrant Alternative for Germany (AfD) decided to steer clear of Mr Bannon, and other rightwingers were wary too. But, with or without the American Svengali, populists seemed in the ascendant. In France the gilets jaunes (yellow jackets), who drew support from the radical right and left, were about to explode onto the streets.
The scene today is rather different. The European Parliament elections in May dashed Mr Bannon's hopes. Mr Salvini's Northern League did do well. But elsewhere the parties of the hard right fell back, or at best marked time. Since then, things have on the whole got worse for them. Mr Salvini is out of Italy's government, having bungled an attempt to secure uncontested power, and has fallen back in the polls; in Hungary, Viktor Orban's populist ruling party faces the threat of losing control of the country's capital, Budapest, and perhaps other cities at local elections later this month. The gilets jaunes have been tamed by President Emmanuel Macron. And this week came the news that another key component of the populist right, Austria's, has come to grief at the ballot box.
Gloating is not advised
All of these setbacks are partial and reversible. Even where the right-wingers have fallen back in places, they are far from a spent force. In Poland, for instance, the Law and Justice party, another example of the populist right, is expected to be re-elected on October 13th; the AfD also did well in state elections in Germany last month.
But liberals can be excused a little satisfaction as they look at recent events. Take Austria first. In May the government collapsed after two German newspapers revealed footage from a video shot inside an Ibiza villa in 2017, showing Heinz-Christian Strache, Austria's vice-chancellor and the leader of the hard-right Freedom Party (FPÖ), discussing corrupt deals with a woman posing as a Russian oligarch's niece. The election on September 29th, triggered by the scandal, was a disaster for the FPÖ. It took just 16% of the vote, almost ten points less than in the 2017 election, and lost 20 MPs. Many voters defected to the centre-right People's Party (ÖVP), which until Ibiza-gate was the FPÖ's senior partner in government. Its young leader, Sebastian Kurz, will now sound out the Greens, the other big winner, as a coalition partner. Mr Strache has quit politics.
Mr Kurz had invited the FPÖ into coalition in 2017, telling concerned European leaders that he could tame its worst impulses. That seems to have been optimistic. The government was scarred by scandal during its short life, ranging from racist incidents involving FPÖ officials to an illegal raid on the domestic intelligence agency orchestrated by Herbert Kickl, an FPÖ hardliner who served as interior minister.
Being out of office does not, of course, mean that the FPÖ has vanished. The party hopes to recuperate in opposition. History suggests it will do so. It has been a fixture of Austrian politics for over 60 years, exploiting popular frustration with the long duopoly of the ÖVP and the Social Democrats, and the corporatist Proporz system that divvied up public jobs and doled out patronage between the parties. Its xenophobia has been less of an electoral handicap in a country that did not go through a German-style post-Nazi reckoning. So when one or other mainstream party has grown tired of grand coalitions it has usually had nowhere to turn but to the FPÖ. Expect to hear from the party again in due course.
The same is true in Hungary. Mr Orban's Fidesz party remains all-powerful in villages and small towns, but faces a strong challenge from the (almost) united opposition in Budapest and larger provincial cities at local elections due on October 13th. The Fidesz party machine has responded with both the potato and the stick: in Budapest's 11th district, 10 kilo sacks of potatoes were sold for less than a euro, with a picture of the local Fidesz mayor attached, and a recipe for rakott krumpli, a Hungarian potato, egg and sausage delicacy.
There have also been fierce attacks on Gergely Karacsony, the united opposition candidate for mayor, who is running neck and neck with Istvan Tarlos, the Fideszbacked incumbent, according to polls. After coming to power in 2010, Mr Orban changed Hungary's electoral law to create a system that favours the strongest party-his own. It has taken the other parties, from left to right, years of squabbling and infighting to realise that the only way to challenge him is to band together, using primaries. Now they have done so. If they succeed, they will have a useful platform from which to challenge Mr Orban at the next parliamentary elections, due in 2022.
But it is in Italy that the fortunes of the populists have suffered the most consequential reverse. The European election was a resounding success for Mr Salvini. His party took more than a third of the votes in Italy. His non-stop campaigning and uncompromising stance on immigration helped his party to unprecedented heights in the polls. By early July, it was averaging 37.5%-a level of support that tempted him to take the misguided decision the following month to bring down the government of which he was part in the hope of forcing an election.
The effect, instead, was to catapult his coalition partners in the anti-establishment Five Star Movement (m5s) into the arms of the centre-left Democratic Party (pd), creating a new parliamentary majority that underpins Giuseppe Conte's second government. Since it was sworn in last month, Mr Salvini has plainly shrunk in stature. Deprived of power and the attention it attracts, he can no longer force himself to the top of the news agenda. Support for the League has fallen to below 32%.
Still, the League remains Italy's biggest party, more than ten points ahead of either the pd or the M5S in the polls. Though down, Mr Salvini is certainly not spent. By removing himself from office, he has avoided having to reconcile his extravagant promises to the electorate with the reality of Italy's public finances. On September 30th the new government approved a framework document that proposes an increased budget deficit of 2.2% of GDP. That may yet prove too much for Brussels, provoking a fresh showdown.
Mr Salvini's prospects will depend on two factors. The first is immigration. The new government has scrapped his policy of closing Italian ports to the ngos that rescue migrants from the Mediterranean. It is hoping instead to extend a scheme agreed last month with France, Germany and Malta for the voluntary redistribution of asylum seekers landing on Italian shores. But a surge in arrivals would boost Mr Salvini's popularity. Though still low, the number has risen sharply since he left office.
However popular Mr Salvini becomes, the League will not get back into power unless the current coalition falls. So how the government manages the tensions between its component groups will be decisive. The pd and the M5S have a long record of mutual animosity, and a split in the pd caused by Matteo Renzi, a former prime minister, has not helped. The new government is trying to change an electoral system that, thanks to its large number of first-past-the-post seats, helps the League. Much depends on whether the new coalition lasts long enough to do it.
As for Mr Bannon, he now faces being kicked out of his monastery by the authorities who say his associates there, who deny any wrongdoing, have failed to meet their financial obligations. But in Italy, as elsewhere, the battle is never over.","Europe 's right - wingers

 LOOK BACK a year , and remember how disquieting European politics seemed . Matteo Salvini , by far the most popular politician in Italy , and France 's equally xenophobic Marine Le Pen had just teamed up with Steve Bannon , Donald Trump 's former strategist , as part of what Mr Bannon called The Movement . This alliance of nativist parties of the right , soon to acquire a "" gladiator school "" based in a monastery near Rome , intended to sweep the forthcoming European elections and tilt the continent 's politics firmly away from the liberal centre ground . They had their difficulties , of course . The Eurosceptic and anti - migrant Alternative for Germany ( AfD ) decided to steer clear of Mr Bannon , and other rightwingers were wary too . But , with or without the American Svengali , populists seemed in the ascendant . In France the gilets jaunes ( yellow jackets ) , who drew support from the radical right and left , were about to explode onto the streets . 
 The scene today is rather different . The European Parliament elections in May dashed Mr Bannon 's hopes . Mr Salvini 's Northern League did do well . But elsewhere the parties of the hard right fell back , or at best marked time . Since then , things have on the whole got worse for them . Mr Salvini is out of Italy 's government , having bungled an attempt to secure uncontested power , and has fallen back in the polls ; in Hungary , Viktor Orban 's populist ruling party faces the threat of losing control of the country 's capital , Budapest , and perhaps other cities at local elections later this month . The gilets jaunes have been tamed by President Emmanuel Macron . And this week came the news that another key component of the populist right , Austria 's , has come to grief at the ballot box . 
 Gloating is not advised 
 All of these setbacks are partial and reversible . Even where the right - wingers have fallen back in places , they are far from a spent force . In Poland , for instance , the Law and Justice party , another example of the populist right , is expected to be re - elected on October 13th ; the AfD also did well in state elections in Germany last month . 
 But liberals can be excused a little satisfaction as they look at recent events . Take Austria first . In May the government collapsed after two German newspapers revealed footage from a video shot inside an Ibiza villa in 2017 , showing Heinz - Christian Strache , Austria 's vice - chancellor and the leader of the hard - right Freedom Party ( FPÖ ) , discussing corrupt deals with a woman posing as a Russian oligarch 's niece . The election on September 29th , triggered by the scandal , was a disaster for the FPÖ . It took just 16 % of the vote , almost ten points less than in the 2017 election , and lost 20 MPs . Many voters defected to the centre - right People 's Party ( ÖVP ) , which until Ibiza - gate was the FPÖ 's senior partner in government . Sebastian Kurz's will now sound out the Greens , the other big winner , as a coalition partner . Mr Strache has quit politics . Sebastian Kurz had invited the FPÖ into coalition in 2017 , telling concerned European leaders that Sebastian Kurz could tame its worst impulses . That seems to have been optimistic . The government was scarred by scandal during its short life , ranging from racist incidents involving FPÖ officials to an illegal raid on the domestic intelligence agency orchestrated by Herbert Kickl , an FPÖ hardliner who served as interior minister . 
 Being out of office does not , of course , mean that the FPÖ has vanished . The party hopes to recuperate in opposition . History suggests it will do so . It has been a fixture of Austrian politics for over 60 years , exploiting popular frustration with the long duopoly of the ÖVP and the Social Democrats , and the corporatist Proporz system that divvied up public jobs and doled out patronage between the parties . Its xenophobia has been less of an electoral handicap in a country that did not go through a German - style post - Nazi reckoning . So when one or other mainstream party has grown tired of grand coalitions it has usually had nowhere to turn but to the FPÖ . Expect to hear from the party again in due course . 
 The same is true in Hungary . Mr Orban 's Fidesz party remains all - powerful in villages and small towns , but faces a strong challenge from the ( almost ) united opposition in Budapest and larger provincial cities at local elections due on October 13th . The Fidesz party machine has responded with both the potato and the stick : in Budapest 's 11th district , 10 kilo sacks of potatoes were sold for less than a euro , with a picture of the local Fidesz mayor attached , and a recipe for rakott krumpli , a Hungarian potato , egg and sausage delicacy . 
 There have also been fierce attacks on Gergely Karacsony , the united opposition candidate for mayor , who is running neck and neck with Istvan Tarlos , the Fideszbacked incumbent , according to polls . After coming to power in 2010 , Mr Orban changed Hungary 's electoral law to create a system that favours the strongest party - his own . It has taken the other parties , from left to right , years of squabbling and infighting to realise that the only way to challenge him is to band together , using primaries . Now they have done so . If they succeed , they will have a useful platform from which to challenge Mr Orban at the next parliamentary elections , due in 2022 . 
 But it is in Italy that the fortunes of the populists have suffered the most consequential reverse . The European election was a resounding success for Mr Salvini . His party took more than a third of the votes in Italy . His non - stop campaigning and uncompromising stance on immigration helped his party to unprecedented heights in the polls . By early July , it was averaging 37.5%-a level of support that tempted him to take the misguided decision the following month to bring down the government of which he was part in the hope of forcing an election . 
 The effect , instead , was to catapult his coalition partners in the anti - establishment Five Star Movement ( m5s ) into the arms of the centre - left Democratic Party ( pd ) , creating a new parliamentary majority that underpins Giuseppe Conte 's second government . Since it was sworn in last month , Mr Salvini has plainly shrunk in stature . Deprived of power and the attention it attracts , he can no longer force himself to the top of the news agenda . Support for the League has fallen to below 32 % . 
 Still , the League remains Italy 's biggest party , more than ten points ahead of either the pd or the M5S in the polls . Though down , Mr Salvini is certainly not spent . By removing himself from office , he has avoided having to reconcile his extravagant promises to the electorate with the reality of Italy 's public finances . On September 30th the new government approved a framework document that proposes an increased budget deficit of 2.2 % of GDP . That may yet prove too much for Brussels , provoking a fresh showdown . 
 Mr Salvini 's prospects will depend on two factors . The first is immigration . The new government has scrapped his policy of closing Italian ports to the ngos that rescue migrants from the Mediterranean . It is hoping instead to extend a scheme agreed last month with France , Germany and Malta for the voluntary redistribution of asylum seekers landing on Italian shores . But a surge in arrivals would boost Mr Salvini 's popularity . Though still low , the number has risen sharply since he left office . 
 However popular Mr Salvini becomes , the League will not get back into power unless the current coalition falls . So how the government manages the tensions between its component groups will be decisive . The pd and the M5S have a long record of mutual animosity , and a split in the pd caused by Matteo Renzi , a former prime minister , has not helped . The new government is trying to change an electoral system that , thanks to its large number of first - past - the - post seats , helps the League . Much depends on whether the new coalition lasts long enough to do it . 
 As for Mr Bannon , he now faces being kicked out of his monastery by the authorities who say his associates there , who deny any wrongdoing , have failed to meet their financial obligations . But in Italy , as elsewhere , the battle is never over .",305,Austria,se-305-3,POST TERM,True,"Its young leader , Sebastian Kurz ,",4,True

BERLIN
The stars have aligned for Germany's Greens
The story of Germany's Greens is a series of once-per-decade eruptions. Forty years ago an eccentric band of environmentalists, peaceniks and anti-nuclear activists gathered in Karlsruhe to set up a political party. In the early 1990s, after the party stumbled by failing to back German reunification, it merged with civil-society groups in the former east, yielding a clunky name that survives today: Alliance 90/The Greens. In 1998 the party joined Germany's federal government serving for seven years as junior partner to Gerhard Schröder's Social Democrats (spd). In 2011, surging in polls after the Fukushima nuclear disaster, they took control of their first German state: Baden-Württemberg, in the rich south-west, where Winfried Kretschmann, a communist-turned-centrist, remains the Green premier today. Now a fifth eruption is looming.
As the Greens prepare to mark their 40th birthday on January 13th, they are squarely ensconced as Germany's second most popular party (behind Angela Merkel's conservative Christian Democratic Union, the cdu), and have a hunger for power that would have scandalised their hippie forebears. Germany's next election is due in autumn 2021, if the ailing ""grand coalition"" of the cdu (and its Bavarian sister party, the csu) and the spd survives that long. Whenever it comes, it will almost certainly restore the Greens to government, probably alongside the cdu/csu. It is even conceivable that Germany will provide the world with its first Green leader (bar a short-lived Latvian premiership in 2004).
A confluence of factors explains the Greens' success. Germany's federal structure offers smaller parties a chance to earn experience, and respect, in the Länder (states). Political fragmentation, and Green flexibility-a coalition with conservatives here, ex-communists there-sees them in office in 11 of the 16 states, as many as the spd. This has trained a cadre of Green professionals in the art of government, rooted the party across Germany and stoked an appetite for power. It has also given the party an effective veto in the Bundesrat (Germany's upper house, which comprises representatives of state governments), where it has tightened energy and climate laws.
The party itself has shaped up, too. For the past two years the Greens have been led by Robert Habeck and Annalena Baerbock, a telegenic, cheerful pairing who personify the triumph of the party's ""Realo"" (pragmatic) wing over its hard-core ""Fundis"". Mr Habeck, 50, a perma-stubbled former minister in the northern state of SchleswigHolstein with a relaxed manner, has quickly become one of Germany's most popular politicians; Ms Baerbock, 39, is a sharp-witted mp who knows her party inside-out. Where previous co-leaders (one from each wing) ran separate party fiefs to keep the peace, the current pair share personnel, philosophy and even an office. The Greens are mostly united, and the leaders' hunger for power widely shared: a recent party congress re-elected them with North Korea-sized majorities. This leaves them well placed to gain from German voters' new obsession with tackling climate change.
Adding meat to the Greens
Above all, the Greens' policies have broadened. ""We are working hard not to be perceived as a single-issue party,"" says Mr Habeck. Take public investment, where the Green plan is a refreshing contrast to the pro-austerity dogma of the cdu and others. The party wants to make up for years of underinvestment by borrowing €35bn ($39bn) per year to upgrade transport, digital, energy and other infrastructure, loosening the constitutional ""debt brake"", which limits deficits, to exploit more generous eu rules. (That would be hard but 1 possible, insists Mr Habeck.) A second strand is a social policy targeted at disaffected spd voters. The Greens want a higher minimum wage, rent caps and to make Germany's welfare system more generous again by softening earlier reforms.
Foreign policy is trickier. Most Greens shed their instinctive pacifism long ago. They take a tough line on China (the party opposes inviting Huawei to build Germany's 5G networks) and Russia (it is against the Kremlin-backed Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline). Yet such impulses do not make up a broader strategy. And since 1999, when the party split over whether to back intervention in Kosovo, it has grown only more sceptical of military adventures abroad. The party resists what Mr Habeck calls the ""symbolic"" nato target of devoting 2% of GDP to defence, instead vaguely urging a focus on capabilities and co-operation with European allies. Yet France, Germany's most important partner, wants it to step up its military help in places such as the Sahel. ""European soldiers, including Germans, must be prepared to deploy under certain circumstances,"" says Mr Habeck, while acknowledging that the issue is ""extremely challenging"" for his party.
Difficult compromises are being forged on climate, the party's signature issue, too. Despite having battled to shake off their image as humourless eco-moralists tossing off prohibitions against motorists and carnivores, the Greens are again talking about bans, which Mr Habeck has called ""the condition for freedom"". The Greens want to phase out coal power and the combustion engine (in new cars) by 2030. They also want cheaper trains, dearer flights, eu tariffs on climate-unfriendly imports and a higher price on carbon emissions-plus compensation for those affected by it. Yet overall the party seeks to harness the power of markets and innovation, not to scare voters with radical proposals implying privation. The party assiduously courts business; Mr Kretschmann, its most successful politician, hugs closely the car firms that employ hundreds of thousands in his state. Still, there are limits. The Greens will not shake off their founding opposition to zero-carbon nuclear energy.
The common thread is a little bit of everything: climate-friendly growth that hurts neither companies nor the poor; investment plus fiscal responsibility; a foreign policy combining ethics with realism, all wrapped in an eu flag. Underpinning this is the closest the party gets to a political philosophy, as outlined by Mr Habeck. ""Society has changed, and the idea of onesize-fits-all parties isn't working,"" he says. ""If you think Greens have the answer, you can vote for us whether you're an old lady or a punk in Berlin.""
To an extent, data back the party's claim to transcend left-right divisions. At the European election in May, where the Greens came second with 20.5%, they took almost as many votes from the cdu as from the spd. (They won among all voters aged under 60.) And as Germans adopt greener lifestyles the party returns the compliment, embracing local customs and traditions. ""I like beer-tents, I like my Dirndl,"" chuckles Katharina Schulze, who led the Greens to their best-ever result in Bavaria in 2018 after campaigning accordingly.
A recent poll found voters favouring a CDu/csu-Green coalition after the next election. Once unthinkable, such ""black"" (conservative)-green tie-ups are spreading: Mr Kretschmann has led one since 2016, and Hesse, another rich state, has a conservative-led one. (In Austria the Greens agreed this week to join Sebastian Kurz's People's Party in coalition.) There was a dry run after Germany's 2017 election, when the cdu/csu, Greens and the liberal Free Democrats tried (and failed) to assemble a ""Jamaica"" coalition. But next time finding agreement on euro-zone, social, asylum and climate policy could prove tricky, and the cdu/csu would seek Green concessions on security policy that the party base might struggle to swallow.
Still, the Greens are likely to ensure that Germany's next election is the first in postwar history in which the cdu and spd fail to occupy the top two spots. Could they lead a green-black government? It is not impossible: they briefly topped polls last spring. A Green-led coalition with the spd and hardleft Die Linke is another option, though the numbers are not yet there. But the chance of a Green chancellor means Ms Baerbock and Mr Habeck must confront the awkward question of which of them it would be. Many insiders quietly admit to preferring Ms Baerbock, but Mr Habeck's charisma and profile make him the favourite.
Such thoughts belie a concern among some Greens that the party's current polling high may prove to be as fleeting as previous ones, especially if an economic slowdown displaces the climate among voters' concerns and the party wilts under the scrutiny of an approaching election. That could happen, but neither governing party looks set to stage a recovery, and the Greens' newly diversified policy portfolio is a hedge against voter caprice. For now, the party appears to be on a steady course towards government. ?","Germany

Juan Guaidó, the president of Venezuela's national assembly, was barred from entering parliament by security forces at the time it was due to decide whether to re-elect him to that post. Mr Guaidó is recognised as Venezuela's interim president by nearly 60 countries. The few parliamentarians whom the regime allowed to enter the building chose Luis Parra as the assembly's new president, but a larger group convened elsewhere and reelected Mr Guaidó.

Fertile ground
In Austria the Green party entered national government for the first time, as the junior partner in a new coalition headed by Sebastian Kurz, the leader of the right-of-centre Austrian People's Party. The Greens won 14% of the vote at a general election in September.
There was a new government in Spain, too, as Pedro Sánchez, who has been leading an interim administration since the first of two inconclusive elections last year, at last won a vote of confidence. But the new coalition, between his Socialists and the left-wing Podemos party, is short of a majority.
In Croatia Zoran Milanovic, a centre-left politician, unseated the incumbent conservative president in a second-round election run-off, a few days after the country assumed the rotating presidency of the eu.
Boris Johnson, Britain's prime minister, held his first meeting with Ursula von der Leyen, the new president of the European Commission, on Brexit. Mr Johnson's hopes of a positive start to talks were dashed when Ms von der Leyen said it would not be possible to deliver the trade deal Britain wanted without extending the transition period. Mr Johnson won a recent election on a manifesto that pledged (in bold) not to extend talks beyond December 2020, and amended the Brexit bill to make this pledge law.

Sebastian Kurz picks up where he left off-this time with the Greens
It was ""the greatest comeback since Lazarus,"" said Werner Kogler. The leader of Austria's Green party was describing its recovery from electoral oblivion last year. Four months ago the Greens were not even represented in parliament, having been wiped out in 2017. But on January 7th they were sworn into office as junior partners to the right-wing Austrian People's Party (övp), marking their first foray into national government. The new coalition also represents a resurgence of sorts for Sebastian Kurz, the young övp leader now reinstated as chancellor of his third coalition. In 2017 Mr Kurz invited the far-right Freedom Party (fpö) into office, an experiment that collapsed last May amid a baroque scandal involving fake Russians and fpö corruption. In the ensuing election the övp and Greens picked up the spoils, enabling a coalition few Austrians had thought possible.
The negotiations were oiled by an unexpected rapport between the two party leaders. Mr Kurz calls the unusual tie-up ""the best of both worlds"". But the extensive övp fingerprints on the deal will leave some Greens wondering. On migration and integration, Mr Kurz's pet themes, the government will consider preventive detention for potentially violent asylum-seekers, ban headscarves for Muslim girls aged under 14 and block eu schemes to redistribute refugees. It will cut income and corporate taxes while aiming for balanced budgets.
To help sugar these pills, the Greens obtained one of Europe's more ambitious climate-change programmes, including a pledge for carbon neutrality by 2040 and a plan to price emissions by 2022. They secured sharper party-financing rules and more aid spending, and will run a jumbo environment, energy and transport ministry. Party officials, eager for power after the wilderness years, backed the deal with gusto. Yet the Greens could have squeezed more out of Mr Kurz, says Thomas Hofer, an Austrian analyst. The coalition is less a meeting of minds than a division of fiefs.
It also helps the 33-year-old Mr Kurz cement his reputation as Austria's changemaker-in-chief. He is once again the world's youngest leader, and yet already a gnarled veteran of Austrian politics, earning over nine years in government a reputation as a smart tactician and political bruiser. Greens either distrust him or, eyeing the woes of his previous coalition partners, fear him. Immigration could yet prove a flashpoint. A curious clause in the coalition deal allows Mr Kurz to make common cause with the fpö in the event of a migration ""emergency"". Yet the Greens' hunger to replace the floundering Social Democrats as Austria's chief progressive force, and to keep the fpö out, will help bind the coalition together.
For optimists, the government hits a sweet spot: greater ambition on climate plus tough migration policies to blunt the appeal of Fpö-style radicals. Might others follow? In Germany, ruled by a weary leftright ""grand coalition"" of the sort that prevailed in Austria before Mr Kurz came along, the idea of a conservative-green government has long circulated. Germany's Greens are wary about drawing lessons from their less experienced Austrian brethren, and the German Christian Democrats (cdu) are more moderate than the övp. Yet for that reason, if even Mr Kurz can pull it off, his many admirers in the cdu may too turn their gaze greenwards. ?","Sebastian Kurz picks up where Sebastian Kurz left off - this time with the Greens

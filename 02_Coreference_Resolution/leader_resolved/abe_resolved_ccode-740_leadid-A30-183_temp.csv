IT MAY be the Land of Lincoln, but it is a long time since Illinois had a leader of Honest Abe's reputation. Four of the state's governors have been indicted in the past half-century, and federal investigators are now looking into ties between fundraising by the current governor, Rod Blagojevich, a Democrat, and the awarding of state contracts. Unfortunately for Mr Blagojevich's Republican challenger, Judy Baar Topinka, the state treasurer, her own party may be too damaged by infighting and past scandals to mount a serious challenge. Having won the nomination on March 21st, in a bitter and surprisingly close primary race, she now must find a way to circle her party's wagons.
In a field crowded with conservatives, Mrs Topinka won only 38% of the Republican vote. Her moderate stance on many social issues (she favours abortion choice, for example) clearly hurt her in the voting. Jim Edgar, a former governor who backed Mrs Topinka, complained that many moderate Republicans--unlike committed conservatives--failed to turn out and vote, a refrain that centrist Republicans across the country have been singing sadly for many years. 
Rows over social issues are only part of the story, however. The party, after all, has long been able to plaster over this rift in other races. What has set Illinois Republicans at each other's throats recently is corruption. The party has been in disarray since 2003, when Mr Blagojevich's Republican predecessor, George Ryan, was indicted on 22 counts of conspiracy and fraud. Mrs Topinka's detractors complain that, because she served alongside Mr Ryan as treasurer, she will be unable to exploit the ethical cloud hanging over Mr Blagojevich. 
Indeed, her Republican primary challengers did their best to tie her to Mr Ryan, whose trial coincided with the later stages of the campaign. The jury began deliberating a week before the primary, and was still pondering the former governor's fate as The Economist went to press (the jurors no doubt trying to work out how Mr Ryan could have enjoyed such a splendid lifestyle while spending as little as $77 a year of his own cash). Mrs Topinka's closest challenger, Jim Oberweis, ran a television ad of her dancing with Mr Ryan, calling it the ""pay to play polka"".
Yet while these attacks will damage her, Mrs Topinka is in other ways the Republican best-placed to exploit Mr Blagojevich's other big weakness: the state budget. She, like many independent experts, has accused the governor of reckless fiscal behaviour. Most notably, he has forecast future savings on pensions payments and counted them as current general revenues. 
These accounting gimmicks are the main way, says Mrs Topinka, in which Mr Blagojevich has been able to expand spending on pet social programmes without breaking his pledge to avoid increases in sales or income taxes. Many of these spending schemes are popular: the governor signed a law last year that provides health care for all Illinois children under 19, for example, and now wants to expand access to pre-school. So if the Republicans hope to unseat him, they must convince voters that the free lunch he is offering really is the result of funny numbers. 
As a three-term state treasurer, Mrs Topinka has a better chance than anyone of driving that message home. But since her ethics have now been questioned by Republican rivals, and given the investigation hanging over Mr Blagojevich's office, it may not be long before the whole race degenerates into wanton mudslinging. The Chicago Tribune, licking its lips, predicts a campaign that will be ""absolutely brutal"".","A moderate Republican now faces a much tougher battle

IF THERE is one Japanese politician already well into the post-Koizumi era, says a protege, then it is the prime minister himself. Junichiro Koizumi, who has held office for five iconoclastic years, promises to step down in September in order to enjoy good food and music once more--not to mention a private life. But already, says the young parliamentarian, the divorce prime minister's heart is on all those things.
Only six months ago, Mr Koizumi still looked at the top of his game. But a financial scandal that implicated his party has gravely dented his authority, as has a row over his attempt to change the rules on imperial succession to allow for the possibility of a female emperor. With little drive from the prime minister, what remains of Mr Koizumi's reform agenda has stalled. The Diet (parliament) is in session at least until mid-June, but little business is getting done. Even the main legislative goal for the ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) this session, passing an education bill that promotes the teaching of patriotism in schools (a long-time obsession of cultural conservatives), looks like not passing in time. The prime minister, just back this week from a tour of west Africa and Sweden, appears to have in his diary only one event to which he looks forward--a summit in June with President George Bush meant to mark the reinvigoration of the security alliance between America and Japan. 
It leaves a curious hiatus in Japan's governance, for the bid to succeed Mr Koizumi is not likely to begin for real till the Diet winds up. Still, the nature of the race is already changing in intriguing ways. For instance, with Mr Koizumi a limping duck, it is no longer clear how powerful his endorsement might be for any would-be successor. This is especially so now, since a new factor that has crept into the race is the issue of Japan's diplomatic isolation in the region--to which Mr Koizumi's visits to the Yasukuni shrine, symbol of Japan's past militarism, have greatly contributed.
Usually, foreign policy is not high on Japan's political agenda. Besides, a reservoir of approval for Mr Koizumi's visits exists among the LDP's many hawks. So the change reflects the degree of party concern about Japan's poor international standing; and a number of undecided party factions, as well as potential kingmakers such as the economy minister, Kaoru Yosano, now demand to know what candidates intend to do about it. This does not help the cause of the front-runner, Shinzo Abe, the 51-year-old cabinet secretary. He is a long-time supporter of Yasukuni visits, and in the new mood this could be a liability. This week, Keizai Doyukai, a club for corporate executives that is close to the LDP, became the first big business group to give public warning of Yasukuni's danger to business with China.
By the same token, the odds have improved for Yasuo Fukuda, a grand old party man who belongs to the same faction as Mr Abe. His late father, Takeo, when prime minister in the 1970s, articulated the ""Fukuda doctrine"" of conciliation with Japan's Asian neighbours. Late last month, Mr Fukuda called for a fresh diplomacy in Asia that built on his father's beliefs. The speech seemed to mark his bid for the leadership. Meanwhile, a long-odds successor to Mr Koizumi, Taro Aso, the foreign minister and another Yasukuni-goer, recently declared that when it came to sensitive issues, national interest should trump private beliefs.
On the economy, the differences among candidates turn on whether a rise in the consumption tax is needed to plug a gaping budget deficit and bring down the high levels of debt incurred when Japan tried to spend its way out of slump in the 1990s. Mr Abe insists that revived growth and lower government spending will plug the gap. The finance minister, Sadakazu Tanigaki, is less disingenuous. He says that a hefty increase in the consumption tax is needed sooner rather than later--which probably explains why Mr Tanigaki is already considered the least plausible of the four probable main candidates.","Who will replace Junichiro Koizumi ?

TARA KONO, a vice-minister and member of the ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP), points out a dispiriting feature of the race to succeed Junichiro Koizumi as prime minister in September: none of the potential candidates is talking about the issues that really matter to voters. Mr Kono has a point--especially about pensions.
In Japan, as in most developed countries, the pension system works by taking contributions from those in work to pay for those in retirement. This works fine with a growing population. But Japan's population is now falling, and the proportion that is over 65, at 19.5%, is already the highest in the world. That figure will reach nearly 30% by 2025, as Japan's post-war generation of baby-boomers is now starting to retire. The number of younger people is also falling fast, meaning fewer workers supporting ever more pensioners. 
The government has taken a few steps to deal with the problem. The pension system has two parts. The contributions that employees and employers make to the earnings-related part will go up a notch each year until 2017, and the minimum mandatory retirement age will rise from 60 to 65 between 2013 and 2025. Contributions to the basic state pension, available to everyone, will also go up; the monthly mandatory contribution of yen13,860 ($126) is to be raised by yen280 each year until 2017.
If you think that will solve the problem, says Mr Kono, then you are at odds with the millions who are abandoning their obligations to the system. Currently over 36% of Japanese are not paying contributions towards the basic pension, and the number is growing. The proportion is over 50% among those aged 20-24, and who can blame them? The system will be bankrupt by the time they come to draw on it. So Mr Kono proposes scrapping the contribution system and funding the basic pension out of a consumption tax, with the wealthiest retirees not eligible for benefits.
Another dispiriting feature of the leadership race is that, instead of taking their case to the country, potential candidates are lobbying behind the scenes to get the backing of the LDP lawmakers who will vote for a new party leader. So, unexpectedly, Mr Kono last week declared his candidacy, one built on solid policy issues, pensions to the fore. He thinks he can change the nature of the race.
""Any new leader"", he says, ""has at least to come forward and say what he proposes to do."" Yet none of the four preferred candidates has definitively said he is even running, partly because each has been trying to sew up the backing of the LDP's nine organised factions. Traditionally, factions support just one candidate. A problem for the Mori faction, the biggest, is that two of its prominent members, Shinzo Abe and Yasuo Fukuda, seem bent on running.
Mr Kono, a stripling at 43, is also a member of a faction. Indeed, it carries his name, or rather that of his father, the speaker of parliament's lower house. Meanwhile a senior member of the faction, none other than the foreign minister, Taro Aso, is also expected to run for the leadership. Who cares, says Mr Kono. Factions have lost their main point since multi-seat constituencies were abolished in favour of single-seat ones in 1996. In 2001 Mr Koizumi broke the factions' hold on the political process by refusing to defer to them when appointing his cabinet, but he did not go far enough. Mr Kono says he will kill off factions altogether, by depriving them of their remaining ability to appoint members to powerful committees and as vice-ministers, like himself. After that, not even the factions' weekly ritual, the Thursday lunch, would have much point.","Debating issues in Japanese politics? What a droll idea

WITH the only world leader to have serenaded him with the Elvis Presley song ""I want you, I need you, I love you"" retiring in a couple of months, President George Bush may soon feel a bit lonesome. For his friendship with Junichiro Koizumi was based on more than just tender words. After the attacks of September 11th, Mr Koizumi threw his country behind America. Stretching Japan's pacifist constitution to its limits, he sent refuelling ships to the Indian Ocean to help America against the Taliban and troops to help reconstruction in Iraq. By inviting Mr Koizumi to Washington on June 29th, Mr Bush wanted to say goodbye and thank you.
The alliance is in far better health than during the 1980s, when American politicians complained of a Japanese economic invasion and a few alarmists even predicted conflict. Mr Koizumi has long looked forward to this trip as his swansong, say aides. Yet something is not quite right. A few weeks ago, Mr Koizumi looked set to be accorded that rarest honour, an address to a joint session of Congress. Now, it transpires, the highlight of the trip will be a pilgrimage with Mr Bush to Graceland, Elvis's home outside Memphis.
Fair enough: Mr Koizumi is an ardent Elvis fan. But the change of venue may spring from worries at the five visits he has made as prime minister to the Yasukuni shrine in Tokyo, which honours Japan's war dead, including 14 Class A war criminals. Suspicion of Japan is strongest in Asia, but there's a bit about in America too. Many servicemen were brutally treated by the Japanese during the war. And American policymakers sometimes fret that Japan's insensitivity makes engaging with a rising China harder.
So, when the possibility of an address to Congress was mooted, Henry Hyde, the chairman of the House International Relations Committee and a war veteran, wrote to the speaker, Dennis Hastert. It would, said Mr Hyde, not be appropriate for Mr Koizumi to use the podium used by Roosevelt to denounce the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbour if he then made his annual visit to Yasukuni on August 15th, the anniversary of Japan's defeat in 1945. The idea of an address to Congress melted away.
Still, he and Mr Bush have substantial issues to discuss. Most recently, the importance of America's alliance with Japan has been underlined by North Korea's preparations to test a long-range missile. America and Japan share an obvious interest in persuading Kim Jong Il not to lob missiles in their direction. Japan feels less threatened, however, by Iran's apparent intention to build nuclear weapons. Urged by America to help it isolate Iran, it fears that this would cut off one of its main sources of oil. 
Japan's interests were not exactly the same as America's in Iraq, either, but Mr Koizumi backed Mr Bush in part because the stakes, for Japan, were lower. Its oil supply was not threatened, and its commitment of troops was largely symbolic. For America, however, preventing Iran from going nuclear is of paramount importance, and doing so peacefully depends in part on Japan supporting any sanctions regime. Japanese officials, however, are very keen to see agreement at the UN Security Council--unlikely, given China's reluctance to let the issue interfere with its own quest for oil.
A final tension between America and Japan concerns trade. If the Doha trade talks are not to collapse, both countries must open their farm markets more. Japan is especially reluctant to do so, as was illustrated by a recent spat over American beef, in which fears of mad-cow disease strengthened the hands of protectionists.
What of the future? Given Mr Koizumi's friendship with Mr Bush, many worry that relations between America and Japan may cool after he goes. That will depend on Mr Koizumi's successor. Of the two main contenders, Yasuo Fukuda wants to mend relations with China by, among other things, drawing the Yasukuni sting. The favourite, Shinzo Abe, is more overtly hawkish. But either will surely find that, whatever they feel about America, they need it.

IN THE week after Kim Jong Il of North Korea fired off seven missiles towards the Sea of Japan, including a long-range ballistic Taepodong-2 that self-destructed soon after take-off, every country with a stake in North Korea's future--even its sole ally, China--has publicly denounced the action. Every country, that is, except South Korea. North Korea is still technically at war with the South, along whose border it masses artillery, tanks and troops. Yet since 2000, South Korea has pursued a ""sunshine policy"" towards North Korea that attempts to engage the hermit state with political dialogue and economic blandishments. Doggedly sunny, the government seems determined not to let this crisis push it off course.
South Korea's president, Roh Moo-hyun, has managed not even to acknowledge the missile firings yet in public. Instead, an odd notice has been posted on the presidential website. Domestic critics of the president's light-handed approach, the notice said, were stuck in the cold war, when South Korean dictatorships would exaggerate the threat from the North in order to increase their control at home. The firing of the Taepodong-2 constituted no crisis, because ""it was not aimed at any particular party."" Japan, rather than North Korea, came in for criticism in the presidential notice: ""There is no reason to fuss over this from the break of dawn like Japan, but every reason to do the opposite."" South Korea's opposition has slated the government for this stance.
But official criticism of Japan has since grown stronger. Some Japanese officials, including Shinzo Abe, the chief cabinet secretary and likely successor to Junichiro Koizumi, the prime minister, have this week raised the possibility of pre-emptive strikes at North Korean missile facilities should an attack on Japan look imminent (though Japan at the moment lacks the capability actually to do it). This brought apoplexy from a presidential spokesman in South Korea, who said it ""exposed Japan's tendency to invade"" other nations; Japan, not North Korea, was responsible for tensions on the peninsula.
South Korea's assiduously muted criticism of North Korea admittedly hides deep concern. Without fanfare, the government said last week that it is suspending the shipments of food and fertiliser on which North Korea depends. Though a planned inter-Korean ministerial meeting this week went ahead in the southern port city of Busan, the government in Seoul stressed that it would not focus on the usual economic exchanges, but rather on the missiles and on stalled negotiations over North Korea's nuclear-weapons programmes. The talks duly broke down. However, business is to continue as usual at Kaesong, the inter-Korean economic zone just across the border in the North.
South Korea's policy of engagement, then, if North Korea itself does not scupper it, is likely to continue. For all the growing debate in South Korea about what the country is getting in return for the sunshine, there is little appetite for an alternative. Among much of the public, an insouciance exists about the North Korean threat. Most South Korean policymakers seem to think that Mr Kim's regime, acutely aware that it has long lost both the economic and military advantage, will strike out only if isolated and provoked.
This means that South Korea's tensions are guaranteed to continue not just with Japan, which is robustly pushing for stronger measures against the North, but also with America. At bottom, South Korea and its ultimate guarantor want different outcomes. President George Bush professes a visceral hatred of Mr Kim, and hopes that the regime will collapse under a combination of internal contradictions and outside pressure. South Korea's engagement policy aims to avert such a collapse, which would present a huge and costly challenge to the South--better, instead, to help North Korea towards prosperity. In polls, South Koreans say they want reunification, but the overwhelming majority believe it should be deliberate, well-planned--and always at least a decade away.
This week, as The Economist went to press, events seemed to be going South Korea's way. Japan agreed to shelve, at least for a few days, a UN Security Council resolution calling for sanctions on North Korea, backed, if necessary, by force. This was intended to give Chinese diplomacy with North Korea a chance to work--China's deputy foreign minister, Wu Dawei, left for Pyongyang on July 10th. Mr Bush's administration also said it was keen to see China rein in a wayward ally. But if such diplomacy fails to get North Korea back to multi-party negotiations, then South Korea's sunshine will stand in growing contrast to American and Japanese hostility towards the North.","South Korea's ""sunshine policy"" continues, for lack of anything better 
IN THE week after Kim Jong Il of North Korea fired off seven missiles towards the Sea of Japan, including a long-range ballistic Taepodong-2 that self-destructed soon after take-off, every country with a stake in North Korea's future--even its sole ally, China--has publicly denounced the action. Every country, that is, except South Korea. North Korea is still technically at war with the South, along whose border it masses artillery, tanks and troops. Yet since 2000, South Korea has pursued a ""sunshine policy"" towards North Korea that attempts to engage the hermit state with political dialogue and economic blandishments. Doggedly sunny, the government seems determined not to let this crisis push it off course.
South Korea's president, Roh Moo-hyun, has managed not even to acknowledge the missile firings yet in public. Instead, an odd notice has been posted on the presidential website. Domestic critics of the president's light-handed approach, the notice said, were stuck in the cold war, when South Korean dictatorships would exaggerate the threat from the North in order to increase their control at home. The firing of the Taepodong-2 constituted no crisis, because ""it was not aimed at any particular party."" Japan, rather than North Korea, came in for criticism in the presidential notice: ""There is no reason to fuss over this from the break of dawn like Japan, but every reason to do the opposite."" South Korea's opposition has slated the government for this stance.
But official criticism of Japan has since grown stronger. Some Japanese officials, including Shinzo Abe, the chief cabinet secretary and likely successor to Junichiro Koizumi, the prime minister, have this week raised the possibility of pre-emptive strikes at North Korean missile facilities should an attack on Japan look imminent (though Japan at the moment lacks the capability actually to do it). This brought apoplexy from a presidential spokesman in South Korea, who said it ""exposed Japan's tendency to invade"" other nations; Japan, not North Korea, was responsible for tensions on the peninsula.
South Korea's assiduously muted criticism of North Korea admittedly hides deep concern.

SINCE North Korea's outburst on July 5th, when the regime of Kim Jong Il fired off seven missiles, including a long-range ballistic Taepodong-2, into neighbouring seas, Japan has displayed a sense of purpose that has surprised even its own diplomats, usually more inclined to follow than to lead. After the firings, Japan immediately called an emergency meeting of the UN Security Council. It drafted a resolution condemning North Korea's actions and calling for sanctions backed by force. This was the first time in living memory that Japan had seized the diplomatic initiative--and about time too, say the many policymakers who want their country to play a more assertive role in the world. ""Japan"", boasts one, ""has lost her virginity.""
But what a horrible experience it might nearly have been. For though Japan's toughness drew praise from America, Britain and France, among others, an element of hyperbole in its reaction unsettled even some supporters. After all, North Korea already has dozens of medium-range missiles able to reach Japan, so a Taepodong-2 (which blew up) hardly adds to the tally. American policymakers still judge North Korea's presumed manufacture of nuclear bombs to be the chief concern. What is more, Japan's noise and fury seemed to be orchestrated by Abe Shinzo, the chief cabinet secretary, for a domestic audience. He is seeking to replace Junichiro Koizumi, the prime minister, in party elections in September. His popularity at home rests in part on taking a hard line against North Korea, hitherto over the regime's refusal fully to account for Japanese kidnapped in the 1970s and 1980s. After the firings, Mr Abe even mused publicly about pacifist Japan making pre-emptive strikes on North Korean missile facilities (though Japan lacks the means at present). That enraged Japan's neighbours, South Korea and China, as much as North Korea.
But Japan's assertiveness very nearly came to grief by appearing not to want to give diplomacy a chance to bring the isolated regime back to the six-party talks involving America, China, South Korea, Japan and Russia. Everyone outside Pyongyang agrees these are the best forum in which to solve North Korean issues. While Japan was merely sounding shrill, China encouragingly said it was sending a high-ranking delegation to Pyongyang to talk reason. Under pressure from America, its ally and mentor, Japan agreed to withdraw its Security Council resolution for a few days.
Had China succeeded in bringing North Korea back to the talks, Japan's diplomacy would have looked badly miscalibrated. As it was, the North Koreans snubbed their only ally, to evident Japanese relief. The action returned to the Security Council. China said it would veto a resolution that threatened force. But with its president, Hu Jintao, under pressure to look statesmanlike as a guest of the G8 in St Petersburg, it agreed on July 15th to a compromise, brokered by Britain, that still strongly condemned the missile tests and banned the transfer of missile-related technology to North Korea. At last China had shown a degree of annoyance with its North Korean neighbour, a striking development after years of avoiding even the mildest criticism--indicating, perhaps, that China has run out of other ideas for bringing North Korea to heel.
Some seasoned observers have doubts about Japan's new assertiveness. The problem with being pushy, they say, is that this approach goes down much better at home than it does with those you are pushing about abroad. But now that Japan seems at last to have lost its diplomatic virginity, there can be no going back.

WITH his only viable potential challenger suddenly dropping out of contention late last week, Shinzo Abe, the chief cabinet secretary, looks all but certain to lead his party, and thus the country, from September. That is when Japan's prime minister, Junichiro Koizumi, retires from front-line politics.
For the past few months, Yasuo Fukuda, a Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) stalwart, the son of a late prime minister and a former chief cabinet secretary himself, had dropped hints about contesting the LDP's presidential election on September 20th. Mr Fukuda judges Mr Abe a policy lightweight, too trusting in small government. He decries the hawkishness in Japan's international relations that Mr Koizumi has propounded and Mr Abe has amplified, especially the visits that both men make to the Yasukuni shrine (above), which enshrines alongside Japan's fallen servicemen 14 wartime figures who were executed for crimes against humanity.
Mr Fukuda, though, has his own shortcomings. At 70, he is not sprightly and, remarkably for a politician, is diffident in public. Still, he had become the focus for the party's disaffected: those in despair at Japan's strained ties with its neighbours, particularly China and South Korea; party veterans alarmed at being frozen out by Mr Abe (who at 51 is from a younger generation), just as they were by Mr Koizumi; and other assorted enemies of the prime minister, Mr Abe's undeclared mentor.
Yet as hopes in Mr Fukuda grew, so did his prevarication. The issue of Yasukuni, which he himself had highlighted, might, Mr Fukuda seems finally to have concluded, give Japan's neighbours too great a sense of a government divided. Mr Fukuda also doubted, says Takao Toshikawa of Tokyo Insideline, a newsletter, whether he had the gumption for the job.
In the end, support for Mr Fukuda ebbed, even within in his own faction. North Korea's provocation by loosing off ballistic missiles on July 5th did no favours for Mr Fukuda's doveish line on foreign policy, says Koichi Kato, a Fukuda supporter who himself led a (disastrous) challenge to the party establishment back in 2000. On July 21st, Mr Fukuda withdrew the challenge that he had not properly thrown down, summing up a political career that never quite lived up to its promise.
In theory, other candidates for the LDP presidency remain, notably Taro Aso, the foreign minister, and Sadakazu Tanigaki, the finance minister. Neither is seriously in contention. So speculation turns to the kind of administration Mr Abe will lead. He has neither Mr Koizumi's force of character, nor his iconoclasm. His government is likely to be a more inclusive one, with nods to the party's older barons, as well as room found for bright young things.
The style of Mr Abe's government will differ from Mr Koizumi's, but its substance may not. For if his grasp of policy is weak, Mr Abe is surrounding himself with advisers who favour smaller government and market-based reforms. In particular, his most vigorous supporter is Hidenao Nakagawa, who exercises immense power as head of the LDP's policy-research council. Along with Heizo Takenaka, the interior minister, Mr Nakagawa has been the architect of Mr Koizumi's domestic policy. Mr Nakagawa will probably keep his post, even if the future of Mr Takenaka, unpopular even among reformers and with no real political base of his own, is less certain.
Whatever the make-up of the next government, a recent signal from the political establishment suggests a new commitment to bring the state's finances under control. After years of spending through the country's long slump, the ratio of gross government debt to GDP stands at 170%, while the budget deficit, though well down from its peak, is over 6% of GDP. 
On July 7th a fiscal plan for the next decade was agreed not just by Mr Koizumi's government but by the ruling party itself. By promising to get the budget back in surplus on a ""primary"" basis (ie, excluding interest payments) by 2011, the blueprint acknowledged that by then an annual yen16.5 trillion ($140 billion) would have to be found, for which spending cuts would make up 70-80%, with tax increases making up the rest. Remarkably, specific cuts were targeted in government programmes. Spending on public works, which has already fallen for six years, will be squeezed further. The government will also be shrunk.
What is more, the plan committed Japan for the first time to a budget surplus even after interest payments, by around 2015; after that, the debt-GDP ratio should start falling. These plans call for a fundamental debate about tax reform, beyond the narrow perennial issue of when to raise the consumption tax, and by how much. For now, a recovering economy is throwing out unexpectedly strong tax revenues, and some of the worst fears about the need for a sharp hike in the consumption tax are fading. Still, the blueprint suggests that sound public finances will be the next government's chief preoccupation.
As for foreign policy, the hawkish Mr Abe may yet produce surprises, thanks perhaps to the late Showa emperor, known before his death as Hirohito. Last week the old diaries of a former head of the Imperial Household Agency were leaked. In them, private conversations with the emperor are recorded, in which he purportedly affirmed that he had stopped visiting Yasukuni because of the war criminals enshrined there in 1978.
The leak gives Mr Abe a chance to draw Yasukuni's sting. On August 15th, the anniversary of Japan's surrender and around the time he is expected formally to announce his candidacy, he usually visits Yasukuni. Should he decline to go this year, claiming deference to the late emperor, he will send a powerful conciliatory message to Japan's neighbours--and to those who oppose him in his party. Should he visit, though, Mr Abe will have proved himself even more cussed than Mr Koizumi.","A post - Koizumi world comes into focus as the list of rivals shortens

WHEN he was running for office in 2001, Junichiro Koizumi, Japan's prime minister, promised to visit Tokyo's Yasukuni shrine every year and to do so on August 15th, the anniversary of the emperor's admission that Japan had lost the war. Mr Koizumi always kept the first part of his promise, but only this week fulfilled the second. In formal morning coat and preceded by a Shinto priest, he spent only ten minutes at the shrine. Yet his visit brought roars of ""banzai"" from the crowd and a storm of disapproval from neighbouring countries.
The shrine is a memorial to 2.5m Japanese war dead, but also the focus for unrepentant militarism. Fourteen top war criminals were secretly enshrined in 1978. A connected museum paints Japan in its wars of 1937-45 as the liberator of Asia, a victim of Western belligerency. Meanwhile, August 15th at Yasukuni is a Bartholomew Fair of thugs, fantasists in military garb, deniers of atrocities and xenophobes peddling conspiracy theories. In previous years Mr Koizumi chose less symbolic dates, emphasising the private nature of his visit. This week it could not have been plainer that he came as prime minister, the first to visit on August 15th in two decades.
Mr Koizumi is no diehard imperialist. He sees the war dead as victims of Japan's own militarism. He does not honour the criminals and has no truck with the museum. His backers say that his statements on these matters are rarely picked up by local critics or by China, which inveighs against him for manipulating history. Besides, they always say, for real abuse why not single out China itself? It uses the past to stoke anti-Japan hatred as a useful tool at home. True, but hardly to the point. Mr Koizumi's feat is to have let a Communist dictatorship wrest the high ground from a pacifist democracy.
The consequences extend beyond the refusal by China and South Korea to hold summit meetings with Mr Koizumi. They make territorial disputes harder to settle and lie at the root of regional opposition to Japan's attempts to gain a permanent seat on the UN Security Council. Mr Koizumi's visits, in short, have undermined his own vision of making Japan more ""normal""--that is, ensuring for it a muscular presence in international affairs commensurate with its huge economy.
Will Mr Koizumi's presumed successor, Shinzo Abe, be any wiser? The chief cabinet secretary has impeccable nationalist credentials, so might be expected to compound the mess. On the other hand, only a right-winger has the authority to draw Yasukuni's sting. And for the first time, polls suggest a majority of Japanese are against their leaders' shrine visits. 
It is not just a matter of avoiding a needless provocation; Mr Abe should kickstart a long-overdue national debate about Japan's wartime responsibility. Somehow, the war criminals enshrined at Yasukuni will have to be removed, even though the shrine has private status. One idea is to turn it into a secular institution, where national leaders, the imperial family and even Chinese dignitaries could pay their respects.
Would China respond? Its leader, Hu Jintao, has also come in for criticism. Instead of harping on about atrocities in the first half of the 20th century, some thoughtful Chinese say, he should emphasise the second half, when Japan was a source of regional stability and a force in China's own modernisation. Japan's desire for ""normalisation"" aims only to build on those benign influences. The trouble is that, with no consensus about the past, Japan's establishment is inept at articulating a better future.

Iran gave its long-awaited reply to an offer of political and economic incentives from America, Russia, China, Britain, France and Germany if it agreed to suspend uranium enrichment in accordance with a resolution from the UN Security Council. It said it was ready for ""serious talks"", but would not stop enrichment by the end-of-August deadline. America's State Department said the reply ""fell short"". The Security Council will now have to discuss sanctions. 
A fragile ceasefire more or less held in Lebanon, despite various infractions, including an Israeli commando attack to stymie what Israel said was a Hizbullah operation to restock its arsenal. European Union countries continued to argue about sending soldiers to beef up the UN peacekeeping force in Lebanon.
Meanwhile, Israel's politics fell into turmoil. Army reservists protested against poor military planning and lack of equipment, there were disputes over how to hold an inquiry into the war, and two ministers and the president, Moshe Katsav, came under criminal investigation. Mr Katsav is accused of sexual assault on an employee, but denies the allegations.

THE news on September 6th that a baby boy had been born into Japan's imperial household for the first time in over 40 years was greeted with relief by a government that had just avoided a constitutional crisis--and with joy by demographers and shopkeepers. The Dai-Ichi Life Institute predicts a mini baby-boom that will produce a bumper crop of potential wives for the little chap, and a welcome yen150 billion ($1.3 billion) boost to the economy.
The as yet unnamed boy, born to Princess Kiko, wife of Emperor Akihito's second son, is third in line to the throne, after the crown prince, 46-year-old Naruhito, and his own father, Prince Akishino, Naruhito's younger brother. The Chrysanthemum Throne is remarkable on several counts. Not only, at 2,600 years, is Japan's easily the world's oldest monarchy, but it also boasts an unbroken male lineage (though eight women have over time stood in as caretaker empresses). What is more, historians of the Imperial Household Agency (IHA) can affirm, the lineage is descended from Amaterasu, the sun goddess born not by Caesarean section, as was the latest little tyke, but from an eye of the god Izanagi.
Yet the boy can expect little of the fun--snowboarding at Verbier, lines of cocaine, teenage romps with first cousins--enjoyed by European royals. The imperial family's treatment would anywhere else count as cruel and unusual punishment. The impenetrable IHA has almost absolute power over the imperial family. The 42-year-old crown princess, Masako, educated at Harvard and Oxford and formerly a high-flyer at the Foreign Ministry, was confined like a factory-farmed animal, forbidden from taking foreign trips with her husband lest this get in the way of reproduction. Though she gave birth to a girl, now four, the pressure from the IHA to produce a male heir contributed to a nervous breakdown, from which she has not fully recovered. Strains between her husband and Prince Akishino seemed to have arisen when Prince Naruhito hinted in public at his anger with the IHA. In other words, Princess Kiko, who is 39, with daughters who are 14 and 11, may have felt pressure to lie back and think of Japan. At any rate, the IHA took no risks; she was whisked to hospital three weeks before the child was due.
The birth comes as a relief to Shinzo Abe, who is expected to take over from Junichiro Koizumi as prime minister at the end of this month. Earlier this year Mr Abe, as the government's chief cabinet secretary, pushed through a bill that allowed for female succession. Though championed by Mr Koizumi, it was anathema to Mr Abe, whose conservative credentials risked being undermined. But then news of Princess Kiko's pregnancy leaked out, and the bill was hurriedly shelved, at least for now.

IT HAS been a thrilling show, but now it is over. On September 20th Japan's Liberal Democratic Party will elect a new leader to replace Junichiro Koizumi, who will formally stand down as prime minister at the end of the month. He is leaving, undefeated at the polls and still popular after five and a half years in the job, only because of term limits imposed by his own party's constitution. But in that brief time he has done more to ""change the LDP, change Japan"", to quote his best slogan, than any politician of his generation. 
Mr Koizumi's achievement is threefold (see page 75). First, he has changed the way politics is carried out in a country that used in effect to be a secretive one-party state, whose leaders emerged from obscure battles between factions convening in smoke- and sake-filled rooms far away from voters' eyes. Mr Koizumi, a rank underdog, snatched the leadership in 2001 only after a huge popular vote from party members forced the hands of the party bosses. He went on to win four elections by appealing, in a way that no Japanese politician had ever even attempted, directly to the electorate. His shaggy hair and natural charisma were refreshing in a party best known for conformity. Most startling of all for Japan, he favoured making big economic reforms. 
Those reforms, the second component of his achievement, have probably been a disappointment to him. Stubbornly resisted by his own party, they have been delayed and partial--most notoriously in the case of the privatisation of Japan's postal savings system, which has too often been a way for politicians to direct citizens' savings to favoured contractors. But at least Mr Koizumi began the work of breaking up the ""iron triangle""--big business, bureaucracy, LDP--making government a bit more accountable, reining in profligate and inefficient spending and in the process starting to tackle Japan's mountainous public-sector debt. 
Partially successful, too, has been Mr Koizumi's quest to let Japan start to play the part it deserves in foreign affairs, his third claim to a place in history. He sent peacekeepers to Iraq, the boldest venture by Japanese troops for half a century, and has worked hard with America to make Japan depend less on America's military umbrella and shoulder more of the burden of its own defence. But he has not succeeded at what ought to have been his priority: the rewriting of Japan's constitution, which renounces war, to assert Japan's right to participate in collective security. At present Japan's peacekeepers are highly constrained, and cannot legally use their firepower to help defend foreign civilians or assist their allies.
A qualified record then, but the point of Mr Koizumi's stint in office is that he has for the first time challenged the comfortable assumptions that have governed Japan since the war. He has attacked entrenched power: of the LDP's own party bosses, of the bureaucrats, and of the victors of 1945, who imposed pacifism on Japan. The big question, however, is whether any of this has changed for good. Perhaps Mr Koizumi is just a latter-day version of the Meiji emperor who, in the late 1860s, wrested power from the shoguns (feudal lords who had usurped it) and set Japan on the path of modernisation. The ""Meiji restoration"" did not last long: a new band of oligarchs and militarists swiftly gathered real power back. 
In the case of China, proceed with caution
Mr Koizumi's successor, it now seems certain, will be Shinzo Abe, currently Japan's chief cabinet secretary. Like Mr Koizumi before him, he is more or less untested and, at 51, relatively young. But he shows little sign of being an iconoclast. Though Mr Abe is a protege of Mr Koizumi's, and is generally numbered in the reformist camp, he has not been one of its truly courageous battlers. Nor does he have much of Mr Koizumi's charisma. The danger therefore exists that he will be able neither to enthuse Japan's voters in the way Mr Koizumi did, nor use personal popularity to force his still-reluctant party further down the road of reform. 
One area where Mr Abe's reforming zeal may exceed Mr Koizumi's is in international relations. He has already committed himself to rewriting the constitution. But the trick is to do this without sending Japan's relations with China into a tailspin. Japan and China are each other's biggest trading partners, and under Mr Koizumi relations have been bad--in part because of Mr Koizumi's provocative habit of visiting the controversial Yasukuni shrine, and in part because China detests Japan's ambition to play a bigger role. Mr Abe is a hawk who entertains dark suspicions about China. He has also been a regular visitor to Yasukuni. If he stays away from the shrine and makes an early fence-mending mission to China, he could do much for Japan's standing in the world. If not, he risks squandering the legacy of a remarkable prime minister.","Japan 's remarkable prime minister is about to stand down . Will his revolution last ?

THE 64-year-old who retires as Japan's prime minister on September 30th has earned a reputation as the reformer of the unreformable. During his tenure Japan's governing apparatus has been transformed, its economy has emerged from long years of degenerative decline, and its dealings with the world have been energised and emboldened. For all that, Junichiro Koizumi remains an enigma.
His triumphs derive from the wars he has waged against the ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP); yet, as the heir to a political dynasty, he built his career at the heart of that party. He used his personal popularity to trump the faction system that had hitherto controlled Japan's prime ministers; yet for all his charm he is a loner, dining for preference by himself. He has yearned to raise Japan's standing in the world; yet he has persisted in making annual visits to the Yasukuni shrine where the souls of Japan's war dead are venerated, and that has destroyed much of Japan's standing with its neighbours. 
When Mr Koizumi won the party presidency, and thus the prime ministership, in April 2001, the LDP had ruled for all but 11 months of the previous 46 years. Or, rather, it had shared power with the heads of big business and the bureaucrats at the main ministries. This ""iron triangle"" had cosseted business, channelling money into industries that, as part of the bargain, guaranteed a lifetime's work and a comfortable retirement for their employees. And Japan thrived. Indeed, in the four decades after the second world war it was the world's greatest success story.
But the success was not everlasting. By the time Mr Koizumi came to office, scandals, corruption and a lack of accountability had thoroughly discredited a system hijacked by interest-groups, the LDP prominent among them. Factions within the party were vehicles for political patronage, and they had enfeebled successive governments, most of them led by antique prime ministers who would serve a brief and ineffectual term. The system had proved incapable of dealing with the slump that followed the property and stockmarket collapse of 1990, leaving Japan's banks with piles of bad loans.
Successive governments had responded by ramping up the spending on public works. That may have staved off a more vicious deflation, but the spending was adding alarmingly to the country's public debt, just as Japan's population was starting to shrink, and so too its tax revenues. Making matters worse, the public-works spending that was smothering the country in concrete merely reinforced the unsavoury links between the LDP's hacks and their supporters in the construction industries. At the same time it entrenched the powers of the bureaucracy, making change even harder.
The system's inadequacy at home was matched by a feebleness abroad. After Japan's defeat in the second world war, America foisted on it a pacifist constitution that limited its forces to the role of self-defence and forbade it to send them abroad. Though the definition of ""self-defence"" had been gradually stretched, Japan seemed unable to shoulder international responsibilities except through its generous aid budget, or even to protect its own direct interests.
All in all, Japan was in a sorry state in 2001. The post-war success story had become a wretched tale featuring a ""lost decade"" for the economy, years of falling prices, insolvent banks, corrupt politics at home, disrespect and ingratitude abroad. 
Enter the Lionheart
Bidding for the party leadership in 2001, Mr Koizumi came with a reputation for pushing change. He was a critic of the faction system, and obsessed with the need to break up the post-office savings system. But he faced Ryutaro Hashimoto, who had served once already as prime minister and who headed the LDP's most powerful and conservative faction. Mr Hashimoto looked a shoo-in.
Mr Koizumi whipped him, however, by using a mastery of television and the popular press to make a direct appeal to the grassroots. It had never happened before. The elders abhorred Mr Koizumi's calls for painful change (""Reform with no sacred cows"") and his attacks upon the party (""Change the LDP, change Japan""). His directness, his wavy-maned flamboyance and his use of the modern media seemed like a running insult to their way of doing things. Soon, though, it was clear that the Koizumi phenomenon was also good for the party. In the elections for the upper house in July 2001, the LDP had its best result in a decade. 
By Japan's standards, the prime minister's agenda was radical. Within the government, cabinet posts were to be allocated by merit and no longer by faction. Spending on public works was to be slashed, and government borrowing capped. The highway corporation, a great source of pork-barrel spending, was to be broken up. Local governments were to be given more power, but also more responsibility. As for the banks, they would have to acknowledge the full extent of their bad loans and then sort them out to get the economy going again.
Above all, Mr Koizumi was going to privatise Japan Post. This ambition--once shared by his grandfather, who had been postal minister--may seem curious. Yet as well as delivering the mail, Japan's postal system is also the world's biggest bank, with yen320 trillion ($2.8 trillion) in savings and life-insurance accounts funnelled towards favoured public-works projects and a collection of public financial bodies and their clients. Like the highway agency, it lay at the heart of the dismal relationship between Japan's politicians, bureaucrats and interest-groups. To break it up would do much for the distortions running through the economy. The public to whom Mr Koizumi appealed seemed to understand his mission.
From the start, though, Mr Koizumi met resistance. The road-building lobby and backers within the LDP stymied change, restoring highway projects that had been axed. Attempts to privatise the postal system fared no better. Worse, too little was being done about the banks' bad loans, and the stockmarket was becoming alarmed. The further the stockmarket fell, the greater the threat of insolvency to the banks, which treated the value of their shareholdings as capital. As a sense of crisis grew in 2001-02, Mr Koizumi looked like yet another in the line of leaders who had delivered little.
A change in fortune came in 2003. That year Heizo Takenaka, an economist brought in by Mr Koizumi to mastermind domestic reforms, made progress with the banks. He toughened their supervision and forced them and their regulators to face up to their parlous state. At last, a vehicle was created to take on banks' bad loans. The stockmarket turned.
In the autumn of 2003 Mr Koizumi crushed a challenge to his party leadership and won a general election handsomely enough, despite the revival of the opposition Democratic Party of Japan (DPJ). A new cabinet appeared to give a sense of purpose. Much of Mr Koizumi's first cabinet had been inherited. However, his second was of his own making. Out went the 81-year-old finance minister and in came a number of young reformists, such as Nobuteru Ishihara, who took charge of the notorious land and transport ministry. Shinzo Abe, an ally, was made the party's secretary-general.
A brighter economy
The recovery that had begun tentatively in 2002 looked more assured as firms began investing again. As companies' profits revived, the banks' bad loans began to fall. Having stood at over 8% of GDP at their nadir in March 2002, they are under 2% today--a drop, says Mr Takenaka, that he had expected to take ten years. The biggest banks have repaid public money. They are starting once more to provide credit to the economy and thus lay the foundation for future growth. It is one of the main accomplishments of the Koizumi era.
In other endeavours, though, Mr Koizumi's government struggled. Hardened operators quickly outmanoeuvred the neophytes brought in to push through privatisation--Naoki Inose, a writer, for the highway corporation, and Mr Takenaka for the post office. Bold proposals were diluted. Though agreement was reached for the highway agency to be split into six, it was to remain in public ownership. As for Japan Post, rather than abolishing its savings and insurance functions altogether, they would continue as separate operations, and privatisation would be deferred to 2017. And despite these large concessions, in August 2005, after a nasty fight, the parliament's upper house narrowly voted the postal plan down.
It was a defining moment, one that Mr Koizumi greeted with relish. He called a snap general election. The DPJ was on the run: though reformist, it had chosen--disastrously as it turned out--to oppose postal privatisation on tactical grounds. But the election was a challenge to the old guard in the LDP too. Mr Koizumi expelled 37 lower-house rebels who had voted against privatisation, and put up allies to run against them. The fight, he told the country, was about a single issue of reform: privatising the post office. The two-thirds majority returned for the LDP and its ruling coalition vindicated him.
His authority now unchallenged, the postal and highway bills quickly sailed through the new parliament. Even if the post office is not yet privatised, says Yasuhisa Shiozaki, a deputy foreign minister and rising star, Mr Koizumi has at a stroke destroyed the country's most powerful political machine, and put an end to pork-barrel politics. He also moved to ""normalise"" foreign and security policy, challenging the limits placed on Japan by its post-war pacifist constitution by sending refuelling tankers to the Indian Ocean and troops to Iraq. He riled China and South Korea by visiting Tokyo's Yasukuni shrine, where among the millions of Japanese war dead who are commemorated are the souls of a number of war criminals.
Yet a new enigma emerged. Although the election had put reform at the centre of politics, and although Mr Koizumi was at the top of his form, he swiftly lost interest in fresh fights, say his colleagues. Early this year the committee he had put in charge of road reform voted to build 9,000km (5,600 miles) of expressways that had first been proposed in the late 1990s. The total cost to the taxpayer will be yen3 trillion. But barely a squeak came from the prime minister. 
Mr Koizumi must step down as party president this month, and so as prime minister. He could, if he chose, exert influence behind the scenes, yet recent behaviour suggests that he will not. Mr Koizumi spent much of the summer on swansong trips abroad, including one to Graceland, with President George Bush. Mr Koizumi says he intends to devote himself to music and the pleasures of the table--not to mention a private life again--and there is every reason to believe him.
The king is dead, long live the king
So will Mr Koizumi's reforming zeal outlast him? It is a mark of change that his successor is presumed to be Shinzo Abe, a man of only 51 years. He is likely to prevail as the next leader of the LDP in the vote on September 20th. Now chief cabinet secretary, he is a Koizumi protege. Most of his main allies--Hidenao Nakagawa, head of the party's policy-research council, Mr Shiozaki, Mr Ishihara, Taro Aso, the foreign minister, and Kaoru Yosano, the economy minister--have played reforming parts during the Koizumi era. 
Mr Abe says he is committed to further deregulation to promote growth. But some foresee a difficulty. Though telegenic, Mr Abe lacks Mr Koizumi's charisma and authority. He will need co-operation within the party to build a governing consensus, or else risk a party revolt. From the outside, says Gerald Curtis, of America's Columbia University, the procedure will look a lot like the backroom politicking that the voters now abhor. It makes reform uncertain.
A brighter view is possible, one that sets Mr Koizumi's reforms in the context of other changes that have been made to the way Japan is governed. The abolition of multi-member constituencies in the mid-1990s and the introduction of public financing of political parties have, for instance, hastened the decline of money politics and factions. Mr Abe himself is leaving his faction, as Mr Koizumi did--an inconceivable move when faction bosses were kingmakers not long ago.
Another change is the way authority has accrued to the prime minister's office within government, and to the secretary-general within the ruling party, a position now in the gift of the prime minister. It means, first, that political advancement hangs more on showing loyalty to the leadership than to your faction. Crucially, it encourages party and government to agree on policy. For example, agreement was reached in July on a fiscal blueprint that is meant to set the country's finances to rights. The plan envisages swingeing spending cuts of up to yen13 trillion a year by 2011. ""No matter what,"" says Mr Nakagawa, the powerful head of the policy-research council, ""we're going to incorporate that July decision in every budget."" Mr Nakagawa insists that reform now flows rudely through the party's veins. 
As for foreign policy, Mr Abe's backers say that the new confidence fostered by Mr Koizumi is here to stay, and that Mr Abe will make a better fist of explaining it to Japan's neighbours. Mr Abe, though like Mr Koizumi a regular visitor to the Yasukuni shrine, and an advocate of a stronger national security, nonetheless appears to think about foreign policy in a more rational way than the strangely emotional Mr Koizumi. Mr Shiozaki says that Mr Abe knows that going to Yasukuni as Mr Koizumi has done would only deepen the mess with Japan's neighbours. This past weekend Japan's deputy foreign minister has been in the capitals of South Korea and China, part of a sudden flurry of diplomatic activity among the three countries. Takao Toshikawa, editor of Tokyo Insideline, a newsletter, predicts that Mr Abe, immediately after becoming prime minister, will break the ice with a visit to Beijing to meet President Hu Jintao.
Mr Abe, carrying forward the Koizumi revolution, may yet prove short-lived as prime minister. He would, for instance, be unlikely to survive an LDP defeat in next July's upper-house elections, which already causes the party concern. Yet if the DPJ won, it would be on a reform ticket: the opposition will not repeat the mistake of opposing change. In other words, even in an LDP defeat, Mr Koizumi's useful legacy will still be discerned.
Caption: Roll out the pork barrel","But now Junichiro Koizumi is stepping down 
 THE 64 - year - old who retires as Japan 's prime minister on September 30th has earned a reputation as the reformer of the unreformable . During his tenure Japan 's governing apparatus has been transformed , its economy has emerged from long years of degenerative decline , and its dealings with the world have been energised and emboldened . For all that , Junichiro Koizumi remains an enigma . 
 His triumphs derive from the wars he has waged against the ruling Liberal Democratic Party ( LDP ) ; yet , as the heir to a political dynasty , he built his career at the heart of that party . He used his personal popularity to trump the faction system that had hitherto controlled Japan 's prime ministers ; yet for all his charm he is a loner , dining for preference by himself . He has yearned to raise Japan 's standing in the world ; yet he has persisted in making annual visits to the Yasukuni shrine where the souls of Japan 's war dead are venerated , and that has destroyed much of Japan 's standing with its neighbours . 
 When Mr Koizumi won the party presidency , and thus Shinzo Abe , in April 2001 , the LDP had ruled for all but 11 months of the previous 46 years . Or , rather , it had shared power with the heads of big business and the bureaucrats at the main ministries . This "" iron triangle "" had cosseted business , channelling money into industries that , as part of the bargain , guaranteed a lifetime 's work and a comfortable retirement for their employees . And Japan thrived . Indeed , in the four decades after the second world war it was the world 's greatest success story . 
 But the success was not everlasting . By the time Mr Koizumi came to office , scandals , corruption and a lack of accountability had thoroughly discredited a system hijacked by interest - groups , the LDP prominent among them . Factions within the party were vehicles for political patronage , and they had enfeebled successive governments , most of them led by antique prime ministers who would serve a brief and ineffectual term . The system had proved incapable of dealing with the slump that followed the property and stockmarket collapse of 1990 , leaving Japan 's banks with piles of bad loans . 
 Successive governments had responded by ramping up the spending on public works . That may have staved off a more vicious deflation , but the spending was adding alarmingly to the country 's public debt , just as Japan 's population was starting to shrink , and so too its tax revenues . Making matters worse , the public - works spending that was smothering the country in concrete merely reinforced the unsavoury links between the LDP 's hacks and their supporters in the construction industries . At the same time it entrenched the powers of the bureaucracy , making change even harder . 
 The system 's inadequacy at home was matched by a feebleness abroad . After Japan 's defeat in the second world war , America foisted on it a pacifist constitution that limited its forces to the role of self - defence and forbade it to send them abroad . Though the definition of "" self - defence "" had been gradually stretched , Japan seemed unable to shoulder international responsibilities except through its generous aid budget , or even to protect its own direct interests . 
 All in all , Japan was in a sorry state in 2001 . The post - war success story had become a wretched tale featuring a "" lost decade "" for the economy , years of falling prices , insolvent banks , corrupt politics at home , disrespect and ingratitude abroad . 
 Enter the Lionheart 
 Bidding for the party leadership in 2001 , Mr Koizumi came with a reputation for pushing change . He was a critic of the faction system , and obsessed with the need to break up the post - office savings system . But he faced Ryutaro Hashimoto , who had served once already as prime minister and who headed the LDP 's most powerful and conservative faction . Mr Hashimoto looked a shoo - in . 
 Mr Koizumi whipped him , however , by using a mastery of television and the popular press to make a direct appeal to the grassroots . It had never happened before . The elders abhorred Mr Koizumi 's calls for painful change ( "" Reform with no sacred cows "" ) and his attacks upon the party ( "" Change the LDP , change Japan "" ) . His directness , his wavy - maned flamboyance and his use of the modern media seemed like a running insult to their way of doing things . Soon , though , it was clear that the Koizumi phenomenon was also good for the party . In the elections for the upper house in July 2001 , the LDP had its best result in a decade . 
 By Japan 's standards , the prime minister 's agenda was radical . Within the government , cabinet posts were to be allocated by merit and no longer by faction . Spending on public works was to be slashed , and government borrowing capped . The highway corporation , a great source of pork - barrel spending , was to be broken up . Local governments were to be given more power , but also more responsibility . As for the banks , they would have to acknowledge the full extent of their bad loans and then sort them out to get the economy going again . 
 Above all , Mr Koizumi was going to privatise Japan Post . This ambition -- once shared by his grandfather , who had been postal minister -- may seem curious . Yet as well as delivering the mail , Japan 's postal system is also the world 's biggest bank , with yen320 trillion ( $ 2.8 trillion ) in savings and life - insurance accounts funnelled towards favoured public - works projects and a collection of public financial bodies and their clients . Like the highway agency , it lay at the heart of the dismal relationship between Japan 's politicians , bureaucrats and interest - groups . To break it up would do much for the distortions running through the economy . The public to whom Mr Koizumi appealed seemed to understand his mission . 
 From the start , though , Mr Koizumi met resistance . The road - building lobby and backers within the LDP stymied change , restoring highway projects that had been axed . Attempts to privatise the postal system fared no better . Worse , too little was being done about the banks ' bad loans , and the stockmarket was becoming alarmed . The further the stockmarket fell , the greater the threat of insolvency to the banks , which treated the value of their shareholdings as capital . As a sense of crisis grew in 2001 - 02 , Mr Koizumi looked like yet another in the line of leaders who had delivered little . 
 A change in fortune came in 2003 . That year Heizo Takenaka , an economist brought in by Mr Koizumi to mastermind domestic reforms , made progress with the banks .

BY A distance, Shinzo Abe this week won the election for the presidency of Japan's ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP), the day before he turned 52. On September 26th parliament will appoint Mr Abe to the prime ministership, after Junichiro Koizumi's extraordinary five-and-a-half years. Beating Taro Aso, the foreign minister, and Sadakazu Tanigaki, the finance minister, he will be Japan's youngest leader since the second world war.
That in itself is a measure of the change wrought by Mr Koizumi: before him, LDP prime ministers were typically gerontocrats, gaining power through factional deals struck in smoky rooms. This time even party elders acknowledge the importance of showing a telegenic face to the public. Beyond that, however, much remains unclear about Mr Abe, his priorities and, indeed, the authority he can bring to office--though something of all these things will be gleaned from the shape of the government he announces next week. 
Mr Abe sprang into the public eye four years ago, with an uncompromising stand over North Korea's admission that it had kidnapped Japanese citizens during the 1970s and 1980s. Just this week, as chief cabinet secretary, he announced a fresh round of financial sanctions against North Korea in response to its missile tests in July. Mr Abe, certainly, is an ardent nationalist, by Japan's standards. He wants Japan to play a more assertive role abroad, and to be prouder and less embarrassed about its past. He proposes that Japan's pacifist constitution be rewritten to allow the armed forces more easily to take part in overseas missions, and he wants legislation to make schools teach a history that is more suffused with patriotism.
These are contentious matters, which alarm those who see a bomb-thrower in Mr Abe. They are, however, just the kinds of issues to get tossed around in committees for years, drawing attention from Mr Abe's shorter-term intentions. For now, his chief discernible foreign intention looks rather hopeful: Mr Abe is responding to signals from a Chinese government desperate to improve bilateral relations that Mr Koizumi's visits to the Yasukuni shrine have undermined. He seems to want to resume the leader-to-leader summits that China suspended with Mr Koizumi.
As for domestic matters, his intentions are even more unclear. With the outcome of the leadership race pretty much certain for the past several months, Mr Abe felt no compulsion to describe his policies. He is in favour of more growth, of a more efficient government and, no doubt, of water draining from Japanese baths counterclockwise. Mr Abe acknowledges the government's indebtedness, now equivalent to 170% of GDP. He has talked about the need to cut public spending on welfare, particularly medical bills. Yet he gives little hint as to whether he really wishes to slash government programmes, or to raise taxes. On the matter of increasing the consumption tax--an issue Mr Tanigaki fought on and which Mr Abe's allies say will be the most pressing domestic matter for the new government--barely a squeak.
Much hangs on his appointments next week. He may put experienced reformists in central positions, appoint practical, broadminded types as foreign-policy advisers, and strengthen the office of the prime minister (he favours the creation of an American-style National Security Council). If so, he will have sent a powerful message about how he intends to govern. If instead he panders to LDP interests or the ultra-nationalist wing, the Abe administration will have started dismally.

THE man who became Japan's leader this week is, at 52, the country's youngest prime minister since the second world war, and the first to have been born after it. His inexperience and his so far largely unarticulated intentions leave everyone guessing. If there is a prevailing opinion, it is that Mr Abe will not have the flair, the authority, or perhaps even the gumption to carry forward the structural improvements to Japan's economy wrought by his unconventional predecessor, Junichiro Koizumi. What authority Mr Abe can muster, it is suggested, will dwindle as defeat looms for his ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) in next July's elections for the upper house. So it is feared that Mr Abe, a hardliner by instinct, will try to distract voters from a dismal domestic record by gratuitous nationalistic provocation of China, and South and North Korea. When they snarl in their different ways, he will scuttle back under America's skirts. 
All possible, certainly. But there is a more hopeful prospect: that Mr Abe, representing a generational change, pushes forward reforms at home and reaches for a bigger role abroad, while undoing the damage to Japan's relations with its neighbours caused by Mr Koizumi's stubborn visits to Tokyo's Yasukuni shrine, a symbol of Japan's past militarism. Mr Abe was due to lay out his priorities to parliament on September 29th, after The Economist went to press. But the government line-up that he announced on September 26th (see page 78) hints that it is this second path that Mr Abe hopes to take.
In traditional fashion, Mr Abe has rewarded older politicians and party factions that early on backed his rise to power. But he has also appointed eager and youngish reformers to key cabinet posts. In foreign policy, he looks like relying on fellow conservatives like himself, but ones with a practical streak--notably Taro Aso, who stays on as foreign minister.
How to revive an ageing economy
Though Mr Abe inherits an economy that has grown for four consecutive financial years, that luck cannot last forever. Japan needs stronger foundations for growth, but they can be laid only by taking on powerful interests. Despite huge changes to the economy, some sectors--including some in manufacturing and much in services--remain largely unreconstructed. Foreign capital would do much to create prosperity and jobs. So Mr Abe needs to improve the climate for investment, including making it easier for foreigners--as well as locals--to acquire Japanese companies.
Growth, and a definitive end to long years of deflation, would bring the exchequer fresh revenues. But with an ageing and shrinking population this would not be enough to plug the budget deficit and bring down Japan's scary levels of national debt. The caps on annual government borrowing and cuts to government projects, both introduced under Mr Koizumi, must therefore continue, and there is much scope still for privatisation. But, unavoidably, taxes must also go up. Mr Abe has studiously suppressed a debate about raising the consumption tax. Even with elections next year, he must start talking about it, in the context of broader fiscal reform that encourages investment and helps people find work. Hardest of all, he needs to tackle the health and social-security costs that eat up so much of the budget. This means challenging powerful medical and pharmaceutical interests, as well as explaining to those who can afford it that they must pay more for benefits. The prize will be a perkier, more resilient economy.
Drawing Yasukuni's sting
Both at home and abroad, Mr Abe will have to put the case better than others have done for Japan's legitimate desire to play a bigger--more ""normal""--role in the world. Long held back not just by a pacifist-sounding constitution, but also by a lack of imagination, Japan under Mr Koizumi made commendable moves towards a more muscular and constructive diplomacy that better matched its economic clout. Its naval supply ships have helped in the battle to defeat the Taliban in Afghanistan. It sent peacekeepers to Iraq. And, unprecedentedly, it took the diplomatic initiative in responding to North Korea's missile tests in July, winning a toughly worded UN resolution that eventually had China's support.
Mr Abe wants to go further. He would like to loosen Japan's constraints on ""collective"" self-defence that prevent both joint military exercises and the defence of allies under fire. Ultimately he wants to revise the pacifist constitution. These are desirable goals, yet they arouse deep suspicions among neighbours--notably China and South Korea. Only last year, China scuppered Japan's bid for a permanent seat on the UN Security Council. And bad relations between the two make it harder to draw China in as a ""responsible stakeholder"" in East Asia and beyond. On relations with South Korea, the signs are promising. Mr Abe and President Roh Moo-Hyun have agreed to meet. But the most important move that Mr Abe could make to help reconcile his foreign-policy ambitions with the neighbours' suspicions is to avoid visiting Yasukuni. 
Given the right signal, China would jump at the chance to resume top-level summits that were suspended with Mr Koizumi. South Korea also says it wants a more ""forward-looking"" relationship with Japan. Drawing the Yasukuni sting (later a way needs to be found to honour Japan's war dead but not the 14 ""Class A"" war criminals also enshrined there) will even help with Mr Abe's next priority: strengthening Japan's security alliance with America, which would like to see Japan's relationship with China improve. Meanwhile, Mr Abe could better explain to Japanese voters the benefits of the alliance with America--something Mr Koizumi was not always ready to do. And he needs to add an economic dimension, perhaps by floating the idea of a free-trade agreement, such as the one America is pursuing with South Korea.
Mr Koizumi's decisions to visit Yasukuni seem to have been emotional. Mr Abe, a regular up to now, is a more pragmatic character. He has not yet signalled what he plans to do; but a cool assessment of both his and his country's interests would argue for staying away from the shrine.","Shinzo Abe has to win trust at home and abroad

HAVING won the race for the presidency of the ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) a week earlier, Shinzo Abe on September 26th was duly elected by parliament to succeed Junichiro Koizumi, the prime minister since 2001. As Mr Koizumi bowed out, Japan's new leader swiftly announced his government.
Those inclined to view Mr Koizumi's iconoclastic years as an aberration from Japan's normal political course may find confirmation in Mr Abe's appointments. Prominent are party hacks who helped Mr Abe to the LDP presidency--Mr Koizumi remained aloof from his backers--while spoils have also been handsomely distributed among the party factions that Mr Koizumi rather hoped to destroy. Thus Koji Omi, a 73-year-old who was an early and vigorous supporter of Mr Abe among a generation that initially disdained him, has been made finance minister; he is no pro-market reformist, though probably in favour of balancing the books. In all, four members of the Mori faction (the party's biggest, to which Mr Abe had belonged) were awarded cabinet posts. The Niwa-Koga faction was thanked for its support with four positions, including a job for Hakuo Yanigasawa, a hapless finance minister under Mr Koizumi, and Sanae Takaichi, who thinks war criminals should be honoured at the Yasukuni shrine and who deplores the right of married women to keep their maiden names. She is the minister for gender equality.
The style of these appointments has disheartened pro-market reformers. Yet while admittedly rewarding party factions and older politicians, Mr Abe has also put vigorous reformists into key posts. In particular, Yasuhisa Shiozaki, a former Bank of Japan official and close ally of Mr Abe, has the crucial job of chief cabinet secretary--the position that Mr Abe held until this week. Staunchly pro-market, Mr Shiozaki thinks that even Mr Koizumi's radical reformer, Heizo Takenaka, who is considered by Mr Abe to be too obviously associated with the Koizumi reforms, grew soft; he is loathed by bureaucrats for his cockiness. In addition, Mr Abe has made an academic, Hiroko Ota, a protege of Mr Takenaka, economy minister. She will steer the Council on Economic and Fiscal Policy, the main policymaking body.
Mr Abe has also moved to centralise authority within a traditionally weak prime minister's office, by creating teams of advisers to hammer out economic and security policy--his models are America's National Economic Council and National Security Council, respectively. Here, too, he has appointed bright, practical minds: notably Takumi Nemoto, another ally, who is responsible for economic policy. Mr Abe has sought to thwart any moves by the party to undercut him by making secretary-general of the LDP the other of Mr Koizumi's two key former reformers, Hidenao Nakagawa, the new prime minister's strongest backer. It all suggests an emphasis on more policymaking, not less.
As for foreign affairs, Mr Abe looks set, unsurprisingly, to count on fellow conservatives like himself. Yuriko Koike, a 54-year-old former journalist who fills the new post of national security adviser, has been a staunch advocate of placing sanctions on North Korea for its refusal to provide details of Japanese citizens abducted in the 1970s and 1980s. Taro Aso, who lost to Mr Abe in the fight to lead the LDP, remains foreign minister. Mr Aso backed Mr Abe in pushing for international sanctions against North Korea after it loosed off missiles in July. But he is also seeking an emollient early summit with China.","A new prime minister picks his cabinet

TRUST North Korea's Kim Jong Il to rain nuclear fallout on his neighbours' diplomatic parade. Announcing this week that he will ""in the future"" go ahead with a long-threatened nuclear bomb-test, Mr Kim seems bent on upstaging the first formal summit handshake in five years between the estranged leaders of Japan and China, East Asia's biggest powers and its natural and sometimes bitter rivals.
The visit by Shinzo Abe, Japan's newly installed prime minister, to China's Hu Jintao this weekend is an enormous step forward. Ill-advised annual visits by Mr Abe's predecessor, Junichiro Koizumi, to Tokyo's Yasukuni shrine, which honours Japan's war dead but also enshrines the souls of 14 ""Class A"" war criminals, needlessly soured diplomatic relations not just with China, but also with South Korea (which Mr Abe is visiting on Monday). It was not all Japan's fault, by any means, but the prospect of the end of its ""cold war"" with China (see pages 29-31) offers hope of progress on all sorts of issues.
He must be stopped
Begin with the most pressing problem, the belligerent Mr Kim. Nobody has benefited more from the recent tensions. Indeed, the North Korean dictator has worked to exacerbate them to win cover for his boycott of six-way negotiations (America and Russia take part too) that aim to put an end to his nuclear plans. He was therefore incensed in July when China, his semi-friend of last resort, finally backed a toughly worded United Nations resolution, sponsored by Japan, that condemned his provocative missile tests earlier that month and called on governments around the world to help curb his missile trading. But he also knows that China is leery of tough economic sanctions, and that South Korea would like to keep trade and aid flowing to his regime at almost any cost. Since America and Japan are bound to press for sanctions in the event of a nuclear-weapon test, Mr Kim may be gambling that, rather than uniting his neighbours against him, detonating a bomb would instead blow them and America apart again.
It is in no one's interests that he be allowed to succeed. China needs regional stability to underpin its continued economic growth. A North Korean nuclear test would add to pressure for Japan, Taiwan and even governments of countries well beyond East Asia to reconsider their anti-nuclear commitments. Free to mount his nuclear bombs on his ever-farther-flying missiles, Mr Kim would be a danger to all. His promise this week not to transfer his bombs to others is likely to prove about as reliable as his earlier promises never to build them in the first place.
So China needs to tell Mr Kim, in unmistakeable terms, that if the test goes ahead, biting sanctions will follow. Similarly, generous flows of South Korean aid that Mr Kim is free to divert to his armed forces or into his own pockets should stop; humanitarian assistance to North Korea's hard-pressed people should continue, but monitored by UN agencies, as other governments insist.
If China, South Korea and Japan cannot agree better on how to respond to the threat of a nuclear test, this weekend's symbolic handshakes will achieve little. That would be a pity, for there are plenty of other issues--tensions over Taiwan, over oil and gas exploration and over competing island claims--that could be better managed by being able to reach for the phone rather than sending in gunboats, as China and South Korea have sometimes done in the past. 
Behind these sharpened conflicts lies something still more troubling. China and South Korea have long criticised Japan for allowing some (in reality rather few) school textbooks that gloss over its wartime atrocities. Yet theirs are no more honest about the past. The result is that young people in all three countries learn to despise each other. Mr Koizumi was wrong to visit Yasukuni, but China's leaders deliberately whipped up anti-Japanese feeling to bolster the Communist Party's nationalist credentials. 
Now all sides have an opportunity for second thoughts. China has been casting about for an excuse to resume summit contacts. This is partly out of fear that anti-Japanese protests were getting out of hand, but also in an effort to protect growing trade and investment from Japan. Restoring top-level ties would also help reassure the neighbours that they have nothing to fear from China's growing economic and military clout.
For his part, Mr Abe's nationalist credentials need no burnishing (though he has not publicly ruled out future shrine visits). The new prime minister would clearly like Japan to play a more ""normal"" and thus prominent role in regional security: it already contributes a great deal in aid, trade, efforts to disrupt proliferation networks and the like, but is constrained from using its armed forces to help even allies in need. So Mr Abe too needs to show that the region's two most powerful countries can rub along more peaceably.
Turning to the future
Both Mr Abe and Mr Hu therefore have reason to turn the weekend's symbolic handshake into a bigger diplomatic opportunity. Yet there is still a long way to go. Unlike in Europe, where bad wartime memories have given way to binding economic, political and military alliances between former enemies, in East Asia resentments have been kept deliberately raw. Rather than overcome their past--Japan's repeated apologies have been stiff, but few of the neighbours have been ready to take sorry for an answer--all sides have relied on America to hold the ring between them.
By cold-shouldering Japan in recent years, China and South Korea have ensured that even the few feeble regional talking shops that do exist have been able to do nothing to mitigate tensions. America has no intention of leaving East Asia to its own devices--it has far too big a stake of its own in peace in the region to do that. But it is surely time for rich Japan, increasingly prosperous South Korea and a more powerful China to shoulder more of the security burden among themselves. That means ending their debilitating private cold war--and letting North Korea's Mr Kim be the first to feel the heat.","A welcome thaw in East Asia 's cold war would be even more useful if North Korea felt some of the heat

 Begin with the most pressing problem , the belligerent Mr Kim . Nobody has benefited more from the recent tensions . Indeed , the North Korean dictator has worked to exacerbate them to win cover for his boycott of six - way negotiations ( America and Russia take part too ) that aim to put an end to his nuclear plans . He was therefore incensed in July when China , his semi - friend of last resort , finally backed a toughly worded United Nations resolution , sponsored by Japan , that condemned his provocative missile tests earlier that month and called on governments around the world to help curb his missile trading . But he also knows that China is leery of tough economic sanctions , and that South Korea would like to keep trade and aid flowing to his regime at almost any cost . Since America and Japan are bound to press for sanctions in the event of a nuclear - weapon test , Mr Kim may be gambling that , rather than uniting his neighbours against him , detonating a bomb would instead blow them and America apart again . 
 It is in no one 's interests that he be allowed to succeed . China needs regional stability to underpin its continued economic growth . A North Korean nuclear test would add to pressure for Japan , Taiwan and even governments of countries well beyond East Asia to reconsider their anti - nuclear commitments . Free to mount his nuclear bombs on his ever - farther - flying missiles , Mr Kim would be a danger to all . His promise this week not to transfer his bombs to others is likely to prove about as reliable as his earlier promises never to build them in the first place . 
 So China needs to tell Mr Kim , in unmistakeable terms , that if the test goes ahead , biting sanctions will follow . Similarly , generous flows of South Korean aid that Mr Kim is free to divert to his armed forces or into his own pockets should stop ; humanitarian assistance to North Korea 's hard - pressed people should continue , but monitored by UN agencies , as other governments insist . 
 If China , South Korea and Japan can not agree better on how to respond to the threat of a nuclear test , this weekend 's symbolic handshakes will achieve little . That would be a pity , for there are plenty of other issues -- tensions over Taiwan , over oil and gas exploration and over competing island claims -- that could be better managed by being able to reach for the phone rather than sending in gunboats , as China and South Korea have sometimes done in the past . 
 Behind these sharpened conflicts lies something still more troubling . China and South Korea have long criticised Japan for allowing some ( in reality rather few ) school textbooks that gloss over its wartime atrocities . Yet theirs are no more honest about the past . The result is that young people in all three countries learn to despise each other . Mr Koizumi was wrong to visit Yasukuni , but China 's leaders deliberately whipped up anti - Japanese feeling to bolster the Communist Party 's nationalist credentials . 
 Now all sides have an opportunity for second thoughts . China has been casting about for an excuse to resume summit contacts . This is partly out of fear that anti - Japanese protests were getting out of hand , but also in an effort to protect growing trade and investment from Japan . Restoring top - level ties would also help reassure the neighbours that they have nothing to fear from China 's growing economic and military clout . 
 For Shinzo Abe's part , Shinzo Abe's nationalist credentials need no burnishing ( though Shinzo Abe has not publicly ruled out future shrine visits ) . Shinzo Abe would clearly like Japan to play a more "" normal "" and thus prominent role in regional security : it already contributes a great deal in aid , trade , efforts to disrupt proliferation networks and the like , but is constrained from using its armed forces to help even allies in need . So Mr Abe too needs to show that the region 's two most powerful countries can rub along more peaceably . 
 Turning to the future 
 Both Shinzo Abe and Mr Hu therefore have reason to turn the weekend 's symbolic handshake into a bigger diplomatic opportunity . Yet there is still a long way to go . Unlike in Europe , where bad wartime memories have given way to binding economic , political and military alliances between former enemies , in East Asia resentments have been kept deliberately raw . Rather than overcome their past -- Japan 's repeated apologies have been stiff , but few of the neighbours have been ready to take sorry for an answer -- all sides have relied on America to hold the ring between them . 
 By cold - shouldering Japan in recent years , China and South Korea have ensured that even the few feeble regional talking shops that do exist have been able to do nothing to mitigate tensions . America has no intention of leaving East Asia to its own devices -- it has far too big a stake of its own in peace in the region to do that . But it is surely time for rich Japan , increasingly prosperous South Korea and a more powerful China to shoulder more of the security burden among themselves . That means ending their debilitating private cold war -- and letting North Korea 's Mr Kim be the first to feel the heat .",740,Japan,A30-183,IN TERM,True,"Shinzo Abe , Japan 's newly installed prime minister ,",8,True

LAST July North Korea fired ballistic missiles into the Sea of Japan. On October 3rd it announced that it would test a nuclear bomb. Relations between the big powers of north Asia are notoriously bad. But this week also brought a ray of light: Shinzo Abe, Japan's new prime minister, declared that his first priority would be to travel to Beijing on October 8th to meet President Hu Jintao and Prime Minister Wen Jiabao, the first formal summit between the two countries in five years. The next day, Mr Abe will attempt the same with South Korea, stopping off in Seoul to meet President Roh Moo-hyun.
North Korea's defiance makes these delicate missions both more difficult and more necessary. Balances of power and influence in north Asia are shifting in unpredictable ways. Japanese economic supremacy not long ago went unquestioned, backed as it was by Japan's defence alliance with America. Now China's rise, economic and military, poses challenges to both. Japan's economic interdependence with China in deepening, but the two countries are also lining up as strategic rivals. This, as much as anything, fuels the desire in Japan to change the country's pacifist constitution, imposed on it by the Americans after the second world war, in a way that would give Japan a less constrained military force. 
The increasing sophistication of South Korea's economy, and its growing links with China, also have consequences for Japan. South Korea, though a military ally of America's, is moving into--or returning to--China's sphere of influence. Japan's territorial disputes with both China and South Korea over the Spratlys are inflamed by the possibility of rich resources around these wretched specks of rock. 
Into this mix, dangerously and unpredictably, comes North Korea. Japan legitimately sees itself as a possible target of North Korean aggression. But though China and South Korea also abhor North Korea's provocations, they are alarmed almost as much by Japan's hawkish response. This summer, before he was prime minister, Mr Abe wondered aloud about launching pre-emptive strikes against North Korea, though Japan lacks the capability to do that yet. In north-east Asia the cold war simmers on.
Japan's troubles with its neighbours are still vexed by past belligerence. In particular, they remember Japan's aggression between 1894, when it first went to war with China, and 1945, its total defeat after the second world war. The leader-to-leader summits that Mr Abe is attempting to revive, after all, were broken off by China and South Korea because of the annual visits that his predecessor, Junichiro Koizumi, made to Tokyo's Yasukuni shrine.
This Shinto shrine is a quiet compound, white with cherry blossom in spring, that sits in the heart of the capital's bustle. It was founded, rather like Arlington Cemetery outside Washington, DC, to commemorate those who died in the mid-19th century civil wars that unified the country. Since then, the souls of 2.5m Japanese war dead have been enshrined there. Unlike Arlington, however, 14 top war criminals from the second world war (including Hideki Tojo, the executed wartime leader) were also enshrined in 1978, after Yasukuni's direct links with the state had been severed. An adjacent museum paints Japan's wars between 1931 and 1945, first in China and then across Asia, as the actions of a peace-loving nation liberating the region from Western imperialists.
In fact about 20m Asians died in these wars. In China alone, perhaps 10m died in scorched-earth campaigns, massacres of civilians and biological warfare--all glossed over by revisionists, and still taught at some schools as merely ""The China Incident"". Though most of the 8m visitors a year honour family and friends who died, Yasukuni has a deserved reputation in Asia as the site of an extreme and hardline view of Japan's past and future. 
Mr Koizumi's Yasukuni visits caused protests across China. Yet he is no warmonger. His visits, according to Ian Buruma, the author of several books on Asia, played to a new mood of patriotic populism in a country that sees both China and South Korea as new economic rivals, and that objects to being lectured about ancient guilt by the undemocratic Chinese.
A sharp taste of the new mood can be found in a private bookshop in Kasumigaseki, in downtown Tokyo. The tiny shop is crammed with bestsellers, some of them thick manga comic books. One of the most popular manga authors is Yoshinori Kobayashi, whose first volume of his series ""On War"" sold nearly 1m copies. In it, he claimed that Japan's Asian wars were honourable and that Japanese atrocities such as the 1937 Nanjing massacre never happened. His latest book describes how Japan's Class A war criminals were actually victims. 
Titles by other authors explain why South Korea is ""the nuisance neighbour"" with an inferiority complex towards Japan, and why the Chinese are hated around the world: they are self-centred, have boorish manners (spitting, never queuing) and spread disease. In the manga books, the Japanese are usually drawn with blond hair and Caucasian features--a habit that reflects a long-held desire in Japan to identify with the West rather than with Asia. Koreans and Chinese, on the other hand, are depicted as swarthy, brutish and slit-eyed.
Yoshiko Nozaki of the State University of New York at Buffalo argues in Japan Focus, an online journal, that the ability of neonationalists to make historical certainties such as the Nanjing massacre sound controversial leads the public to feel that these issues remain unresolved among experts. Certainly, such books are so ubiquitous in Japan that the visitor soon ceases to be shocked. What surprises still is that this particular little bookstore sits on the first floor of Japan's foreign ministry.
The view from China
When Mr Abe arrives at Beijing's Capital Airport on October 8th, few Chinese will be aware that $250m in cheap loans from Japan helped pay for a big expansion of the facility in the 1990s. In China's state-controlled media, Japan is rarely portrayed positively. There is hardly a mention of the tens of billions of dollars-worth of low-interest loans and outright gifts that Japan has given China since the late 1970s--loans that China has thought of as its due as a developing country, and which it does not care to see as atonement for the war. When Japan decided last year to phase out its loan aid to China by 2008, the state media published indignant commentaries describing this as an affront, and only in passing revealed details of Japan's largesse. 
For the Chinese Communist Party, it is useful to portray Japan as an unrepentant aggressor with dreams of reasserting military dominance over Asia. The party has always sought to assert its legitimacy by representing itself as a bulwark against Japanese hegemony. China's school textbooks are filled with stories of communist heroism in the war, and of Japanese brutality. Since the crushing of the Tiananmen Square protests in 1989 and the collapse of much of the rest of the communist world in the early 1990s, the party has struggled all the harder to justify its grip on power. ""Patriotic education"", stressing the party's wartime role and the depravities of the Japanese invaders, has played a central role in this effort. 
But Chinese leaders know the dangers of giving nationalism too free a rein. Police stood by as thousands of demonstrators protested outside Japanese diplomatic missions in China in April last year. This, the biggest upsurge of anti-Japanese unrest in years, was sparked by a visit by Mr Koizumi to Yasukuni. But the authorities quickly grew nervous and sent clear signals that the protests must stop. Their worry is that nationalist unrest may turn against the government and undermine China's efforts to convince the rest of the world that its economic rise is unthreatening. Anti-Japanese organisations are closely monitored by the police. 
The government also worries about the possible impact on Japanese direct investment, which last year overtook that of South Korea to reach $6.5 billion, more than one-tenth of the total received by China in 2005 according to China's figures. Businesses in China with a share of Japanese investment employ some 9.2m Chinese. Yet Japanese investment rose by nearly 20% last year despite the demonstrations, suggesting continuing confidence among Japanese businessmen in the security of their assets in China. Japanese exports to China increased by a more lacklustre 6.4% compared with the previous year's 27.2%. But public disdain for Japanese products appears to have played little part in this. Growth was strongest in the second half of the year, after the protests. 
Consumers certainly make harsh judgments about Japanese products. Since mid-September the Chinese media have railed against SK-II, a Japanese cosmetics brand owned by Procter & Gamble, an American household-goods company, because of traces of heavy metals found in its skincare products. (Procter & Gamble says the cosmetics concerned are safe, meeting standards in Japan.) State-run newspapers have highlighted the Japanese rather than American connections of the products. In Shanghai, angry consumers besieged SK-II counters until police dispersed them. Most Chinese profess contempt for ""little Japan"", and young people with no experience of the war often jeer more stridently than their parents. But few appear to let patriotism get in the way of shopping. 
The government's fears of nationalism turning against the party itself may be better founded. The protests last year mainly involved members of the new middle classes whom the party regards as a bulwark of its support, and whose nationalist expectations have to be met. The demonstrations were organised using the internet and mobile phones, apparently spontaneously: a tactic that shocked the authorities, and may well have encouraged their efforts in recent months to clamp down on online dissent. 
The limits of China's nationalism are suggested by the government's decision to arrange Mr Abe's trip without a public pledge beforehand not to visit the Yasukuni shrine. It is also unlikely to insist that Japan make concessions on the evaluation of its wartime history as a precondition for resuming normal top-level contacts. The Chinese leadership does not want to make specific demands that will be rebuffed by Japan and thus provide an excuse for a fresh round of protests. 
A problem called North Korea
Nor is it likely that China will allow its frosty relationship with Japan to affect its handling of North Korea. In July, China departed from its normal reluctance to censure North Korea by supporting a United Nations Security Council resolution, drafted by Japan, condemning North Korea's missile tests earlier that month. The resolution forbade trade in missile technology with North Korea and called for a halt to missile testing. To encourage China not to veto the resolution, a clause was removed that could have been construed as approving military action against North Korea in the event of its non-compliance. But the Americans and Japanese were delighted that China was willing to make its disapproval so public. 
Continuing friction between China and Japan could have serious consequences, however, if North Korea decides to conduct a nuclear test. China would then be worried that Japan would respond by developing its own nuclear capability, or by launching pre-emptive strikes against North Korean missile bases. Its hope is that Japan's reaction would be restrained by America, which does not want a nuclear arms race in the region any more than China does. But it is not confident of America's ability to do this. 
China's chief foreign-policy objective in the near term is to avoid confrontation in order to give itself breathing room to focus on the economy and manage wrenching social change. It does not want problems with Japan to escalate. Although little progress has been made in the two countries' discussions about gas extraction in the East China Sea, China has not aggressively pushed its claims to an exclusive economic zone stretching close to Okinawa. It hopes that re-establishing top-level dialogue with Japan will help avoid a crisis if, for example, military vessels should happen to collide in the area. 
But China's stand-off with America over Taiwan will still overshadow its relationship with Japan. China will continue to brush aside Japan's longstanding complaints about the secretiveness of China's armed forces and the big annual increases in its budget. America has the same complaints, to which China has responded with only a few token gestures. China will continue gearing up its navy for possible conflict in the Taiwan Strait, an area of enormous strategic concern to Japan because it straddles vital shipping lanes. 
These preparations, which have intensified since the late 1990s, include the deployment of medium-range missiles capable of hitting Japanese targets--a strategy aimed at deterring Japanese assistance for any American intervention in such a conflict. But China does not appear to have any plans to attack, except in the extremely unlikely event that the island changes its constitution to sever its notional links with the mainland. In the past couple of years, in fact, China has become less belligerent and increasingly confident that a more malleable government, more eager to establish good relations with the mainland, will take power on the island in the next presidential elections in 2008. 
China is unlikely either to order any sweeping changes to the anti-Japanese stance of its history textbooks. In Shanghai there has at least been a glimmer of flexibility in the recent publication of a school textbook that reportedly devotes less space than usual to foreign invasions (including Japanese wartime atrocities) and more to the history of positive trends such as technological innovation. But a torrent of online criticism of the book is likely to make the government cautious about spreading its use more widely. When it comes to dealing with anything Japan-related, public opinion counts in China. 
President Hu Jintao is now trying to consolidate his grip on power in the buildup to a crucial five-yearly party congress late next year, at which he hopes to install proteges who will eventually take over from him. As a cautious man, he is unlikely to risk making big adjustments in the months ahead to such a sensitive area of foreign policy as relations with Japan. But if Mr Abe at least stays away from the Yasukuni shrine, Mr Hu will feel that his ostracism of Mr Koizumi has paid off. 
History lessons
On his trip to China and South Korea, can Mr Abe give indications of greater sincerity than Mr Koizumi? On foreign policy, the prime minister employs cooler calculations than his predecessor, who seemed too often to operate on an emotional plane. Mr Abe also has impeccable conservative credentials, which inoculate him against charges at home of being soft on China. With his call for more ""forward-looking"" relations, it is possible that his summitry will be deemed a success by all sides. On the other hand, in the long run both Mr Abe's gut beliefs and his strong sense of being the heir to a political dynasty argue against the kind of frank assessment of Japan's past that the neighbours are calling for. 
Mr Abe's grandfather was Nobusuke Kishi. As prime minister in 1960 Kishi strengthened Japan's alliance with America, arguing that it was in Japan's national interest to do so. His grandson now forcefully argues that the alliance can be further strengthened only if Japan plays a greater part in its own defence; hence his support for constitutional change. But Mr Abe's beloved grandfather was also a key official in Japan's war efforts. During the 1930s he ran industrial policy in the puppet-state of Manchuria. In the 1940s, as minister for munitions, he oversaw the forced-labour programmes. After the war he was indicted as a Class A war criminal, though never charged.
Mr Abe, a regular Yasukuni-goer before he became prime minister, has sought to protect his grandfather's name. He does not believe Japan's wartime behaviour to be exceptionally evil. He has questioned the legitimacy of the victors' Tokyo tribunal that judged war criminals, though he will presumably peddle a softer line now that he is prime minister. Yet even if Mr Abe does not visit Yasukuni as prime minister, says Yukio Hatoyama, secretary-general of the opposition Democratic Party of Japan, uncertainty about whether he will go or not will still harm Japan's relations with China and South Korea.
Above all, Mr Abe has hammered home to his people the need for Japan to stand tall. He insists that Japan's young need a patriotic education that leaves out the uncomfortable bits of the past. This may imbue Japan's shiftless youth with manliness, but it is unlikely to ease Japan's relations with its neighbours. There is no getting away from history.

As a cautious man , he is unlikely to risk making big adjustments in the months ahead to such a sensitive area of foreign policy as relations with Japan . But if Shinzo Abe at least stays away from the Yasukuni shrine , Mr Hu will feel that his ostracism of Mr Koizumi has paid off . 
 History lessons 
 On Shinzo Abe's trip to China and South Korea , can Shinzo Abe give indications of greater sincerity than Mr Koizumi ? On foreign policy , Shinzo Abe employs cooler calculations than Shinzo Abe's predecessor , who seemed too often to operate on an emotional plane . Shinzo Abe also has impeccable conservative credentials , which inoculate Shinzo Abe against charges at home of being soft on China . With Shinzo Abe's call for more "" forward - looking "" relations , it is possible that Shinzo Abe's summitry will be deemed a success by all sides . On the other hand , in the long run both Shinzo Abe's gut beliefs and Shinzo Abe's strong sense of being the heir to a political dynasty argue against the kind of frank assessment of Japan 's past that the neighbours are calling for . 
 Shinzo Abe's grandfather was Nobusuke Kishi . As prime minister in 1960 Kishi strengthened Japan 's alliance with America , arguing that it was in Japan 's national interest to do so . Shinzo Abe's now forcefully argues that the alliance can be further strengthened only if Japan plays a greater part in its own defence ; hence Shinzo Abe's support for constitutional change . But Shinzo Abe's beloved grandfather was also a key official in Japan 's war efforts . During the 1930s he ran industrial policy in the puppet - state of Manchuria . In the 1940s , as minister for munitions , he oversaw the forced - labour programmes . After the war he was indicted as a Class A war criminal , though never charged . 
 Shinzo Abe , has sought to protect Shinzo Abe's grandfather 's name . Shinzo Abe does not believe Japan 's wartime behaviour to be exceptionally evil . Shinzo Abe has questioned the legitimacy of the victors ' Tokyo tribunal that judged war criminals , though Shinzo Abe will presumably peddle a softer line now that Shinzo Abe is prime minister . Yet even if Shinzo Abe does not visit Yasukuni as prime minister , says Yukio Hatoyama , secretary - general of the opposition Democratic Party of Japan , uncertainty about whether Shinzo Abe will go or not will still harm Japan 's relations with China and South Korea . 
 Above all , Shinzo Abe has hammered home to Shinzo Abe's people the need for Japan to stand tall . Shinzo Abe insists that Japan 's young need a patriotic education that leaves out the uncomfortable bits of the past . This may imbue Japan 's shiftless youth with manliness , but it is unlikely to ease Japan 's relations with its neighbours . There is no getting away from history .

Now that North Korea has carried out a nuclear test, can anything be done to punish it? Or would the collapse of the regime be even more dangerous? 
THE reaction was swift, furious and unanimous. North Korea's (claimed) nuclear test on October 9th was ""brazen"", said the Chinese government--unusually harsh words from North Korea's biggest provider of aid, and its only friend. ""Unacceptable"" and ""provocative"", said President George Bush. He had talked to the leaders of Russia, China, South Korea and Japan; all had agreed that an ""immediate response"" was called for.
But what? The cries of outrage were followed by humming and shuffling--except in Japan, which almost immediately cut off trade. America's secretary of state, Condoleezza Rice, having stressed there would be no attack on Pyongyang, added that the North Koreans would now face sanctions ""unlike anything they have faced before"". But might a more isolated North Korea behave even more badly? Or might sanctions trigger its collapse, bringing a flood of refugees and unleashing nuclear mayhem? 
On October 11th the UN Security Council was still discussing what sanctions to impose. America wants international inspections of all cargo moving in or out of North Korea, and the freezing of North Korean assets linked to illicit activities. China, while anxious to exclude any threat of military force and keen to limit the scope of sanctions, showed unusual willingness to talk about such things. It may even scrap a ""treaty of friendship"" signed with North Korea in 1961, which commits China to defending North Korea if it is attacked.
Exactly what happened at the underground site about 110km (70 miles) from the Chinese border at 10.36am local time on Monday remains unclear. Experts believe that, for a nuclear explosion, it was unusually small. But whether or not it was as successful as claimed, the timing of the blast annoyed China intensely. Hu Jintao, its president, had only just agreed with Shinzo Abe, Japan's new leader--at the first summit between the two countries for five prickly years--that a North Korean nuclear test would be ""unacceptable"". Mr Abe's prescient summitry has gained him much respect in the region and at home, but China has been caught on the back foot. 
North Korea's only courtesy to its ally was a 20-minute warning of the test. For a country that sacrificed hundreds of thousands of lives to help North Korea in the war of 1950-53 and that has been a crucial provider of food and fuel during North Korea's recent years of economic disarray, this was a poke in the eye. China's patient efforts since 2003 to host ""six-party talks"" on North Korea's nuclear programme with North Korea, South Korea, Japan, Russia and America--an unusually assertive step by China to solve an international crisis--were shown to be a complete failure. 
But for all its anger, China remains deeply worried about any move that might cause instability in North Korea, with which it shares a 1,400km border. So too does South Korea. Even before the emergence of a nuclear threat, South Korea still faced a 1.1m-strong North Korean army, most of which is deployed close to the south and which, with artillery shells and conventional missiles, could quickly devastate Seoul, the capital. It also faces, in North Korea, the world's largest active chemical and biological armoury. 
Much as it resents the behaviour of North Korea's Kim Jong Il, China is not pushing for regime change. Jasper Becker, the author of a recent book on North Korea, claims that China made contingency plans for a possible invasion of North Korea three years ago when it worried that America might launch a strike against North Korea's nuclear facilities. The aim would have been to install a pro-China government that would forsake nuclear weapons. But Mr Becker says China's military chiefs concluded it could not be done. 
China is not at all convinced that an escalation of sanctions would help either. Yan Xuetong of Tsinghua University says this could simply provoke an embattled North Korea into conducting more tests in order to perfect its nuclear deterrent. He says it is in China's interests to have a government in North Korea that is hostile to America: this reduces America's flexibility in any military response to a crisis in the Taiwan Strait. In Mr Yan's view, China's outrage at North Korea's test is similar to that of France and Germany over America's invasion of Iraq in 2003. Although it strained relations, ""they are still allies."" 
If Kim falls
In discussions with America about how to handle North Korea, China has emphasised that talk of regime change is taboo. If word of such a conversation were to leak to the North Koreans, it fears, this would destroy whatever trust they have in China and any chance of a negotiated settlement. 
But whether or not the sanctions under discussion are intended to bring Mr Kim down, his regime might collapse anyway. Without reliable statistics it is hard to be certain; but it seems that though North Korea has recovered somewhat from a tailspin in the 1990s, including a famine that killed as many as 3m people, it is still growing at a snail's pace. Much of its industry remains in tatters. The International Crisis Group, an NGO, says in a new report that North Korea's food supplies are stable now because of a decent harvest last year, despite floods this summer that destroyed crops and killed several hundred people. But it stresses that the country is unlikely to be self-sufficient in grain for the foreseeable future, and that the risk of food shortages is growing--not least because food aid, fully half of which comes in from China and South Korea, may now dwindle. An economic collapse could create instability, even civil war, for which none of the powers involved is prepared. South Korea, in particular, dreads the cost of rebuilding the North.
China and America have shown no sign of talking, let alone agreeing, on how to handle a collapse of the regime. China might decide to send troops across the border, in order to staunch a refugee exodus on North Korea's territory rather than its own. It might even want to take full control of the North. But how this would be co-ordinated with any plans by South Korea and America to intervene has not been worked out. Rival foreign armies might find themselves in conflict. Ralph Cossa, of the Pacific Forum of the Centre for Strategic and International Studies, says the Americans would probably prefer to stand back and let South Korean forces cross the border. Others say that the Americans expect to be first across, and with very messy fighting and humanitarian work to do. 
Pushing for regime change is still better than accepting North Korea as a nuclear power, in Mr Cossa's view. In addition to cutting off oil supplies and food aid, other than contributions through the World Food Programme (WFP), China should open its borders to North Korean refugees. The resulting exodus, he says, would prompt ""serious thinking"" in Pyongyang. 
China, however, would not think much of this plan. In recent years it has struggled to deter famished North Koreans from venturing across the border. Those found are sent back to North Korea, where they are often imprisoned or even executed. A few have succeeded in getting into foreign diplomatic missions, which have arranged with China for their safe passage to other countries. But in recent years China has set more armed guards and barbed wire around embassies and consulates to stop such attempts. 
Apart from not wanting to irritate North Korea, with which it has an agreement to repatriate refugees, China fears that a flood of desperate North Korean asylum-seekers would destabilise its north-eastern provinces. Widespread lay-offs from state-owned enterprises have already caused dissension there. Perhaps 50,000-300,000 North Koreans are hiding in north-eastern China, a number that would surge massively if the border were opened. China fears that a big increase in the number of ethnic Koreans in the border region could, in the long run, raise demands there for secession from China and integration into a united Korea. 
An ancient grievance
Although China's ties with South Korea have rapidly improved in recent years, with South Korea now accounting for more than 8.5% of foreign direct investment in China in non-financial sectors (just behind Japan), China worries that a united Korea would be awkward to deal with. Already in South Korea, despite the two countries' often similar feelings about North Korea, anti-Chinese sentiment is easily aroused. In 1895 China lost a war with Japan for control of Korea, which had been under China's sway. Many Koreans suspect that China wants to dominate the peninsula again, as a useful buffer against a more assertive Japan. 
South Koreans have been outraged by China's efforts to portray the ancient kingdom of Kogoryo, which Koreans see as a forerunner of their modern state, as Chinese. Kogoryo stretched from north-east China to North Korea, prompting some to speculate that China's claim to it presages designs on the northern part of the peninsula. South Korea's president, Roh Moo-hyun, is due to visit Beijing on October 13th. Ancient history is on his agenda. 
South Korea would agree with China, however, that wide-ranging economic sanctions against the North would not be helpful. In July China agreed for the first time to sanctions by accepting a UN resolution that condemned North Korea's missile tests that month and called for a halt to any trade with the North in missile technology. Earlier this year, the state-owned Bank of China froze North Korean assets in its Macau branch in response to an American initiative to clamp down on North Korea's use of foreign bank accounts to launder illicit money. And although China is secretive about its food aid to North Korea, WFP officials believe shipments have fallen sharply this year. South Korea suspended its direct food aid to the North after the missile tests. 
But China and South Korea have other economic interests in North Korea that have been expanding even as the nuclear dispute has continued to worsen. Chinese companies have been hungrily eyeing North Korea's mineral reserves, from iron ore to coal and gold. With its mining sector hampered by outdated technology and poor infrastructure, North Korea has welcomed approaches by Chinese companies hungry for resources to feed China's industrial boom. Details are difficult to obtain. But Chinese media said last year that Chinese state-owned companies were proposing to invest more than $880m in North Korea's Musan iron-ore mine near the Chinese border. The South Koreans too have shown little inclination to sever their economic interests. Business has continued at its showcase projects with the North, the Kaesong economic zone--where workers hand-picked by the North Koreans work for South Korean enterprises--and the Mount Kumgang tourist enclave, both cash cows for the Kim regime.
Seoul's sunshine, Tokyo's toughness
Mr Roh acknowledged after the test that the South's ""sunshine policy"" towards North Korea was coming unstuck. His country's efforts to engage North Korea had been intended to change the North's behaviour, but an increasing number of South Koreans see little to show for it. Mr Roh is coming under pressure to suspend the Kaesong and Kumgang ventures. But he will think hard before doing so, for fear that this would raise tensions further. 
Japan is far more willing to get tough. On October 11th it imposed its own extra sanctions, banning North Korean ships from its ports and cutting off all North Korean imports. Before this, it was North Korea's third-largest trading partner.
Much more can be done, the Japanese believe, to stop Mr Kim's flow of cash, notably in China. Mr Kim chiefly makes his money from a shadowy network of enterprises known as Division 39. Some of the group's businesses appear to be legitimate. It is the biggest exporter of ginseng and the pine mushrooms (often picked by prisoners) that are an autumn delicacy in Japan, and it has interests in seafood and metals. But it also engages in drug smuggling, counterfeiting and arms sales. The proceeds from these rackets are spread around the regime, particularly the army, to cement its support for Mr Kim's leadership. This explains why North Korea has reacted so shrilly to America's moves against the North's banking assets in Macau.
Japan has at least declared categorically that North Korea's test will not prompt it to pursue its own nuclear programme. This means that one of China's biggest concerns has, for the moment, abated. China is also doubtless relieved that Mr Bush, in his statement on the test, sounded more anxious about nuclear technology seeping from North Korea (a ""grave threat"" to America) than he was about the test itself. 
But the United States and most regional powers do not yet see eye to eye. Christopher Hill, the chief negotiator on North Korea, said before the test that America was ""not going to live with a nuclear North Korea"". North Korea's northern and southern neighbours feel they simply have to.","Getty ImagesGetty Images

THE school of Japan-watchers that keeps an eye on the country's economy chiefly out of a morbid interest in terminal decline has stopped dwindling. It has even taken on new adherents of late. For signs are mounting that the recovery that began in 2002 has slowed--or even, some say, gone into reverse.
The chief worry is that what started as a recovery driven by exports (chiefly to China), and then expanded to one led by business investment, has failed to spread to households, whose spending remains sluggish. Prices still flirt with deflation (see chart). And some economists predict that figures published on November 14th will show that the economy actually shrank in the third quarter.
This exacerbates a deeper unease: a belief that the new prime minister, Shinzo Abe, has more interest in foreign affairs than in tackling the domestic rigidities that constrain Japan's potential to grow. The belief was reinforced by his energetic diplomacy over North Korea in his first month in office. But he was being written off even before that, either on the grounds that he lacked the reformist instincts of his predecessor, Junichiro Koizumi, or that he lacked the authority to push through unpalatable reforms, with important upper-house elections due next July.
Is this growing uneasiness justified? Mostly not. Take the economy first. Certainly, its anaemic performance marks this recovery as out of the ordinary, but then it follows long years of extraordinary distress. Habits are hard to change. So even though households now have more income--because companies are hiring more, and raising overtime and bonuses--this has not shown up in consumer spending. Alarm mounted last week when the main survey of household spending recorded a plunge in September of more than 6% compared with a year earlier. Yet this fall is too big to be credible; the survey (like early GDP numbers and other Japanese statistics) is notoriously unreliable.
Meanwhile, expectations are rising, even if habits have not yet caught up. Households' estimates of future inflation and property prices have climbed since the spring. People are not spending gaily, but they are starting to remove money from risk-free havens and invest it again. Deflation had killed the appetite for risk. There are other signs that the recovery is still broadly on track, even if it has, as in 2004, hit a soft patch. The latest bank lending figures seem to confirm this: though growth slowed in October, the year-old recovery in bank lending is still intact.
On November 7th the Bank of Japan's governor, Toshihiko Fukui, gave warning that it would not wait for a build-up in inflation before raising interest rates, now at 0.25%. Many economists think that the central bank is itching to raise rates, so risking undercutting a weak economy. ""Core"" inflation--including energy but excluding fresh food--is just 0.2%. If energy is excluded, as it is in other countries' measures of core inflation, prices are actually falling. So a rate rise this year would probably generate more controversy than the central bank is ready for. Meanwhile, with interest rates low and the yen weak, monetary conditions are exceptionally loose. The economy might confound downbeat expectations in the coming months.
Ditto, with luck, the prime minister. For Mr Abe is throwing out hints of wanting to bring about more far-ranging structural change than his predecessor managed. After he had cleaned up the banks' bad loans, so setting the stage for economic recovery, Mr Koizumi's great--some would say, only--passion was for privatisation of the postal-savings system, which lunged at the heart of Japan's money politics. Mr Abe, by contrast, has strengthened economic policymaking within the prime minister's office, and reinvigorated the key body of the early Koizumi years, the Council on Economic and Fiscal Policy, stuffing it with reformists. 
One of its members, Takatoshi Ito, of Tokyo University, says the ideas spilling out of the council point to a new stage of change for Japan. The aim is to tie the country more deeply into the global economy by seeking more free-trade agreements (including even with China and America) and boosting pitifully low levels of foreign investment in Japan. A priority is to address Japan's so-called ""dual"" economy. The competitive exporting industries are not matched in agriculture and services, which are shielded from competition, lack economies of scale and are backward in their use of information technology. To boost investment, the government is mulling a cut in corporate income tax and other tax changes. Deep reforms to pensions and health care are also expected.
Japan's demography, says Genichiro Sata, the minister for regulatory reform, demands higher growth, and it is the Abe government's intention to impart deep structural change--including even a wholesale restructuring of government, by crunching Japan's 47 prefectures into a handful of American-style states. These are early days. Mr Abe has given little sense yet of his priorities, and many of the proposals are hardly vote-winners. Reformist achievements are yet to be seen. But the charge that Mr Abe has no reformist intentions is getting harder to make.","Shinzo Abe -- may be more vigorous than Shinzo Abe look

The belief was reinforced by his energetic diplomacy over North Korea in his first month in office . But he was being written off even before that , either on the grounds that he lacked the reformist instincts of his predecessor , Junichiro Koizumi , or that he lacked the authority to push through unpalatable reforms , with important upper - house elections due next July . 
 Is this growing uneasiness justified ? Mostly not . Take the economy first . Certainly , its anaemic performance marks this recovery as out of the ordinary , but then it follows long years of extraordinary distress . Habits are hard to change . So even though households now have more income -- because companies are hiring more , and raising overtime and bonuses -- this has not shown up in consumer spending . Alarm mounted last week when the main survey of household spending recorded a plunge in September of more than 6 % compared with a year earlier . Yet this fall is too big to be credible ; the survey ( like early GDP numbers and other Japanese statistics ) is notoriously unreliable . 
 Meanwhile , expectations are rising , even if habits have not yet caught up . Households ' estimates of future inflation and property prices have climbed since the spring . People are not spending gaily , but they are starting to remove money from risk - free havens and invest it again . Deflation had killed the appetite for risk . There are other signs that the recovery is still broadly on track , even if it has , as in 2004 , hit a soft patch . The latest bank lending figures seem to confirm this : though growth slowed in October , the year - old recovery in bank lending is still intact . 
 On November 7th the Bank of Japan 's governor , Toshihiko Fukui , gave warning that it would not wait for a build - up in inflation before raising interest rates , now at 0.25 % . Many economists think that the central bank is itching to raise rates , so risking undercutting a weak economy . "" Core "" inflation -- including energy but excluding fresh food -- is just 0.2 % . If energy is excluded , as it is in other countries ' measures of core inflation , prices are actually falling . So a rate rise this year would probably generate more controversy than the central bank is ready for . Meanwhile , with interest rates low and the yen weak , monetary conditions are exceptionally loose . The economy might confound downbeat expectations in the coming months . 
 Ditto , with luck , the prime minister . For Mr Abe is throwing out hints of wanting to bring about more far - ranging structural change than his predecessor managed . After he had cleaned up the banks ' bad loans , so setting the stage for economic recovery , Mr Koizumi 's great -- some would say , only -- passion was for privatisation of the postal - savings system , which lunged at the heart of Japan 's money politics . Mr Abe , by contrast , has strengthened economic policymaking within the prime minister 's office , and reinvigorated the key body of the early Koizumi years , the Council on Economic and Fiscal Policy , stuffing it with reformists . 
 One of its members , Takatoshi Ito , of Tokyo University , says the ideas spilling out of the council point to a new stage of change for Japan . The aim is to tie the country more deeply into the global economy by seeking more free - trade agreements ( including even with China and America ) and boosting pitifully low levels of foreign investment in Japan . A priority is to address Japan 's so - called "" dual "" economy . The competitive exporting industries are not matched in agriculture and services , which are shielded from competition , lack economies of scale and are backward in their use of information technology . To boost investment , the government is mulling a cut in corporate income tax and other tax changes . Deep reforms to pensions and health care are also expected . 
 Japan 's demography , says Genichiro Sata , the minister for regulatory reform , demands higher growth , and it is the Abe government 's intention to impart deep structural change -- including even a wholesale restructuring of government , by crunching Japan 's 47 prefectures into a handful of American - style states . These are early days . Mr Abe has given little sense yet of his priorities , and many of the proposals are hardly vote - winners . Reformist achievements are yet to be seen . But the charge that Mr Abe has no reformist intentions is getting harder to make .",740,Japan,A30-183,IN TERM,True,Shinzo Abe -- and the economy,2,True

BALLISTIC and nuclear adventurism by Kim Jong Il this year has not fundamentally changed Japan's calculations about its safety--the North Korean threat, after all, has been around for a while. But it has lent urgency to old arguments for a more muscular security policy. Japan's new prime minister, Shinzo Abe, who desires a more "" normal"" (read ""assertive"") Japan, has, thanks to Mr Kim, a reason to revisit many of the taboos that constrain Japan's Self-Defence Forces--please do not call them the armed forces. Mr Abe favours rewriting the pacifist constitution that America imposed upon Japan after defeat in the second world war. However, he appears to dismiss musings by some in government about the country of Hiroshima developing its own nuclear weapons.
The pacifist part of Japan's constitution lies in its brief Article 9. It stipulates, first, that ""the Japanese people forever renounce war as a sovereign right""; it does not allow the use or even threat of force to settle disputes. The second part says that ""land, sea and air forces will never be maintained."" In practice, thanks to constitutional interpretations by earlier governments, Japan maintains one of the world's most powerful and modern military forces. Yet its operations are still hobbled. Article 9 has long been interpreted as denying Japan the right to defend itself outside its own territory, or to come to the aid of others, notably America, its ally with 50,000 troops based in Japan.
The North Korean missile threat highlights the contradictions. If North Korea is seen to be readying an attack on its island neighbour, must Japan stand by and wait for the attack before responding? The idea that a pre-emptive strike might be legitimate was raised by Mr Abe himself last summer, when he was chief cabinet secretary, though Japan gives no sign of wishing to acquire the offensive means.
A less theoretical matter has to do with co-operation between Japan and America over ballistic-missile defence, the main counter to Mr Kim. Since North Korea fired a long-range missile over Japan in 1998, Japan and America have worked closely to develop systems that send interceptor missiles to destroy incoming warheads, and last week agreed to speed up their deployment. Japan had already ordered new Aegis guided-missile destroyers with sophisticated radars, and Patriot missile batteries on land. America has installed an early-warning radar in northern Honshu, Japan's main island, and is putting an advanced Patriot on its Kadena base in southern Okinawa, to serve until Japan's own missile defence is robust.
Yet the question, even then, is what Japan may do to help its ally, given Japanese strictures against collective self-defence. Though a North Korean long-range missile headed for continental America would probably not pass over Japan, one headed for Hawaii might. In practice, Americans want to know whether Japan would shoot down missiles overflying Japan: current constitutional interpretations seem to forbid it. Japanese policymakers worry that if Japan cannot come to America's help in a crisis, Congress might one day wonder why on earth Americans should be committing so much to defend Japan. 
Possible North Korean proliferation of weapons of mass destruction also exposes the gap between Japan's desires and its self-imposed shackles. Japan is a charter member of the American-led Proliferation Security Initiative, which envisages intercepting suspicious cargoes, and has since Mr Kim's nuclear test trumpeted its eagerness to help. But its practical options are limited. It has said it will back up American patrols at sea, yet its navy may not come to Americans' aid if attacked. 
Whatever the prime minister's wishes, a change to the constitution, which requires a two-thirds majority in both houses of parliament and a national referendum, is still a long way off. In the meantime, Mr Abe promises a close look at quite what the constitution forbids--a hint of reinterpretations to come. 
This week the chief cabinet secretary, Yasuhisa Shiozaki, suggested that the government would reconsider a 2003 ruling preventing missile defences from protecting another country. Separately, the head of the Japan Defence Agency, Fumio Kyuma, says he hopes a bill will be introduced into parliament next May that turns the agency into a full ministry, with cabinet status. The oddity of agency status, he says, ""is not good enough if the country is attacked and we are called upon to defend it."" Taken together, steps such as these could take Japan a long way towards Mr Abe's goal of being ""normal"".

SOMETHING has gone terribly wrong with Japanese education--or so say the Japanese. They fret that Japan has slipped down the international rankings for high-school literacy, mathematics and science. In the OECD's last assessment of 15-year-olds in 41 countries, Japan remained a healthy second in science, but had fallen from first to sixth in maths and from eighth to fourteenth in reading ability.
Parents are also worried about the resurgence of bullying and suicides among schoolchildren. Facing probable defeat in next summer's upper-house election, the fledgling government of Shinzo Abe has been casting around desperately for something--anything--to prove that it really is listening to people's concerns. Education is seen as a handy distraction.
The kind of reforms the government has in mind, however, are not designed to help young people make critical judgments in a fast-changing, information-driven, global environment. Instead, the ruling Liberal Democratic Party and its coalition partner, the New Komeito, have rewritten Japan's post-war education law with the aim of boosting patriotism among the young.
Bunmei Ibuki, the education minister, also believes elementary schools have no place teaching foreign languages such as English. The first requirement, he insists, is that pupils acquire what he calls a ""Japanese passport""--ie, a thorough grasp of the country's history and culture, and perfection in their own language.
Parliament's lower house has approved legislation which, besides stressing the importance of parental guidance, requires schools to instil ""a love of one's country"" in children. The opposition parties boycotted the recent lower-house vote, but the ruling coalition's majority in the upper chamber has allowed the bill to scrape through and become law.
Because it was used in the past to fan the flames of militarism, teaching patriotism has long been taboo in Japan. With its heavy emphasis on morality and nationalism, the new legislation bears some resemblance to the Imperial Rescript on Education of 1890. In the decades up to the end of the second world war, children were forced to memorise the rescript and recite it, word for word, before a portrait of the emperor. Following Japan's surrender, the allied occupiers ended the practice, appalled by its demands for juvenile self-sacrifice in the name of the emperor. 
The paradox is that Japan does need serious education reform. The school system and curriculum were designed 60 years ago, when a generation of children from farming communities were being trained for long, uncomplaining hours on production lines. In the intervening years the economy has changed out of all recognition. Yet the education system--with its continued emphasis on facts and figures and drilling of mental arithmetic--has remained stubbornly rooted in the past.
Its continued economic success suggests that Japan's teenagers are paying less heed to all this, as they quietly master the creative skills needed to prosper in a modern world. In this context, perhaps those perplexing slippages in formal grades, mirrored in other post-industrial countries, ought actually to raise a cheer.","Instilling love of country is not the main challenge for Japan 's schools

TOSHIHIKO FUKUI, the wily governor of the Bank of Japan (BoJ), would dearly like to raise interest rates. But he decided on December 19th that holding off was the wise thing to do. Under Mr Fukui's stewardship, the BoJ has regained much of its lost credibility--thanks to the no-nonsense way it has purged a decade's-worth of dud loans from the banking system and created the conditions for the economy's continuing, albeit wobbly, recovery. In the process, the central bank has earned respect in political circles. And that has translated into less government meddling.
But with the new government of Shinzo Abe, the prime minister, hoping the fragile rebound will continue at least until next summer's upper-house election, the BoJ is treading cautiously. Mr Abe's office says that no pressure was put on Mr Fukui to hold rates when he was called in last week for a friendly chat. But it was made subtly clear that were the bank to slam on the brakes, then it would feel the wrath of the ruling Liberal Democratic Party. No one in political and financial circles will ever let the BoJ forget how it raised the key rate in 2000 from zero to 0.25%--only to lower it again six months later when the increase made deflation even worse.
The central bank is also sensitive to criticism that this summer it prematurely announced the end of Japan's debilitating era of deflation. After six years of essentially free money, the BoJ sneaked in a quick interest-rate rise--from zero to 0.25%--in July, hoping that this would not stop inflation inching higher. In fact, the core consumer-price index has drifted between zero and 0.1%. In Japan the core CPI includes energy prices but not those of food. After stripping out energy, inflation was actually negative in the past few months.
That has not stopped the central bank from making plans to raise its key unsecured overnight call rate to 0.5%. It is concerned about the amount companies have been pouring into capital investment. The rebound in commercial-property prices in Tokyo and other large cities has driven capital spending to new heights. Thanks to the rising value of their properties, against which they can secure loans, smaller firms now find it easier to borrow for investment--as their bigger brethren do. As a result, capital investment has gone through the roof. And although GDP growth for 2005 has lately been revised down (from 2.6% to 1.9%), it is thanks only to exports and capital investment that the economy has continued to expand since the recovery got under way in 2002.
The central bank is glad that the surge in capital spending has been there to support the economy, but it is anxious that things should not get out of hand. It is mindful of the way cheap money in the 1980s stoked up such a firestorm of investment in the private sector that stock and land prices soared. When the bubble burst in 1990, bad debts brought the banking system close to collapse and the nation fell into a decade of recession and deflation. After living through such a trauma, Mr Fukui is adamant that runaway investment should never again be allowed to wreak such havoc on the economy.
He is also concerned about the way Japan has been supplying much of the world's liquidity. With the Federal Reserve's key rate at 5.25% and the European Central Bank's main rate of 3.5%, the BoJ's ultra-low 0.25% has fuelled an unhealthy boom in the yen carry trade--as investors borrow cheaply in Japan to invest in higher-yielding assets overseas. Mr Fukui believes the dangers of keeping such a loose monetary policy for so long outweigh any short-term gains, and the sooner ""normalcy"" is achieved the better.
The BoJ had hoped that another small 25 basis-point rise could have been made at its monetary-policy board meeting on December 18th and 19th. The central bank's own quarterly Tankan survey of business sentiment, released on December 15th, confirmed that corporate Japan remains upbeat about future profits, with confidence spreading from large manufacturers to smaller firms. The survey also showed that job prospects and capital spending are rising as well. The one thing that prevented the nine-member policy board from recommending a rate increase was the lacklustre spending by consumers, reflected in the waning confidence of the big retailers. 
Everything from inclement weather to job insecurity has been blamed for consumers' reluctance to spend. Yet even as company profits have soared (up a further 15% in the last quarter), wages have barely risen. As a result, households have had to dip into their savings to make ends meet. The Cabinet Office gives warning that the once-lauded savings rate, which peaked at 23% of household income in 1973, is now down to a Western-like 2.7%. With retirement beckoning for so many, there is a limit to how far Japan's ageing people are prepared to raid their piggy banks today. And since consumer spending accounts for 57% of Japan's GDP, growth will remain puny until companies spread more of their profits around.
Some firms may have started to do just that. The job market is tightening and company balance sheets are strong. Bankruptcies declined a further 15% in November compared with October, while overdue debts fell a solid 32%. All told, liabilities were down 50% on a year ago. As the economy approaches something like full employment, wages can go only one way--up. 
Some people argue that private consumption is actually far stronger than the official figures suggest. The data are notoriously unreliable and are invariably adjusted months later. For what it is worth, the Cabinet Office's consumer-confidence survey rose in November for the second straight month. One way or another, the BoJ should have a clearer idea about how much people have been spending--and whether to risk raising its key borrowing rate--from late January onwards. But one thing is clear: Mr Fukui will eventually raise rates in the Year of the Boar--and not just once but probably several times. And that is something Mr Abe's government will have to get used to.","Although the recovery is still fragile , Japan should brace itself for interest - rate rises

THE first sign that the Bank of Japan (BoJ) was having second thoughts appeared on Wednesday. Bond prices suddenly spiked up, even though the odds were supposedly five to one in favour of the BoJ raising its key rate from 0.25% to 0.5% after its policy board concluded its monthly meeting on January 18th. The word around the watering holes of Nihonbashi, where the BoJ is headquartered, was that the board was about to reverse its decision. Within minutes, the yield on the popular ten-year government bond plunged six basis points (hundredths of a percent), to 1.675%, as traders rushed to cover their excessively bearish positions. On cue, the yen tumbled in currency markets around Asia as it became clear that Toshihiko Fukui, the governor of the Bank of Japan, was about to defy expectations of a rate rise.
Once again, his bank decided discretion was the better part of valour. Having tasted the fruit last July of its first interest-rate rise in almost five years, the BoJ has been keen to have another bite. It came close to raising the unsecured overnight call rate from 0.25% to 0.5% in December, but backed off when enough of the nine-member policy board raised doubts about the strength of the economy's recovery.
On Thursday afternoon the U-turn was confirmed. The policy board, which Mr Fukui chairs, had voted six-to-three to keep the rate at 0.25%--at least until the preliminary GDP figures for the last quarter become available in mid-February. Although the economy continues its expansion, the bank noted, consumer prices and spending had yet to impress (see chart).
What was left unsaid was that there are growing doubts within both the government and the ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) about the bank's central policy. Indeed, the BoJ has been under intense pressure over the past week from the government not to rock the boat. Hiroko Ota, the economic and fiscal-policy minister, called on the BoJ to be ""accountable"" (code for ""watch out""). She said the central bank should ""support Japan in its struggle to exit from deflation."" Despite the BoJ's view that deflation is dead, core consumer prices, excluding fresh food and energy-related items, are still falling. 
To the government, the idea of raising borrowing costs in these circumstances is out of the question. Hidenao Nakagawa, the powerful secretary-general of the LDP, even threatened to use the government's powers to delay the implementation of a rate rise if the BoJ was rash enough to recommend one. It was not.
With its popularity tumbling, the government of Shinzo Abe is facing a potentially disastrous six months. If Mr Abe and his party lose the upper-house election this coming July, he will be out on his ear. Indeed, pundits are already talking about the post-Abe era. With panic spreading through the LDP ranks, the government is determined to stifle all talk about interest rates. Mortgage rates, politicians note with alarm, are already inching up as the BoJ squeezes the money supply. Indeed, it is raising rates by stealth--the overnight call rate is around 0.3%, well above the BoJ's official target of 0.25%. Meanwhile, wages have stagnated and the public has refused to go out and spend.
Warm weather was blamed for the languid winter sales. But retail sales have been sluggish all year. The Cabinet Office's household survey for the year to December (released mischievously while the BoJ's policy board was in session) shows that confidence had slipped further. The government's fear is that the economy's fragile recovery is failing to take hold and recession could return.
Mr Fukui is less fretful and fidgety. As governor, he has shown in the past that he can stick to a long-term, pro-active stance on the economy, rather than allowing the bank to be deflected by every minor setback. His view is that the economy is on the right track--indeed, it is enjoying its longest expansion in decades. Admittedly, most of the growth is coming from the corporate sector, mainly in the form of surging exports (thanks to the weak yen) and investment in factories and equipment (courtesy of excessively low interest rates). But, in the BoJ's view, the growth in corporate earnings will feed through to Japanese households via fatter bonuses and wage rises. It is only a matter of time.
That is the problem. What Japanese voters are hearing from their employers is that profits may be soaring, but the money is needed for investment rather than frivolous things like higher pay today. Japanese firms are exposed to the full blast of competition from efficient suppliers in low labour-cost countries. That is something which does not seem to have been factored into the BoJ's thinking. It assumes that corporate profits will automatically pass through into wages, letting household spending take up the economic running. But thanks to the punishing effects of globalisation, this central plank of its policy looks a little shaky.","The Bank of Japan does as it is told and sits tight 
 THE first sign that the Bank of Japan ( BoJ ) was having second thoughts appeared on Wednesday . Bond prices suddenly spiked up , even though the odds were supposedly five to one in favour of the BoJ raising its key rate from 0.25 % to 0.5 % after its policy board concluded its monthly meeting on January 18th . The word around the watering holes of Nihonbashi , where the BoJ is headquartered , was that the board was about to reverse its decision . Within minutes , the yield on the popular ten - year government bond plunged six basis points ( hundredths of a percent ) , to 1.675 % , as traders rushed to cover their excessively bearish positions . On cue , the yen tumbled in currency markets around Asia as it became clear that Toshihiko Fukui , the governor of the Bank of Japan , was about to defy expectations of a rate rise . 
 Once again , his bank decided discretion was the better part of valour . Having tasted the fruit last July of its first interest - rate rise in almost five years , the BoJ has been keen to have another bite . It came close to raising the unsecured overnight call rate from 0.25 % to 0.5 % in December , but backed off when enough of the nine - member policy board raised doubts about the strength of the economy 's recovery . 
 On Thursday afternoon the U - turn was confirmed . The policy board , which Mr Fukui chairs , had voted six - to - three to keep the rate at 0.25%--at least until the preliminary GDP figures for the last quarter become available in mid - February . Although the economy continues its expansion , the bank noted , consumer prices and spending had yet to impress ( see chart ) .

THE six men in dark suits proclaimed it a victory, happily shaking hands. Back in Washington, George Bush merely said he was ""pleased"". He cannot be blamed for his guarded enthusiasm. The agreement, reached in Beijing on February 13th, declared that North Korea would close its nuclear plants within 60 days in return for aid and other inducements. If it holds, it may help to reduce tensions on the Korean peninsula in the wake of the North's nuclear test last October. But a nuclear-free North Korea remains an elusive goal. 
It took 3 years of negotiations, interrupted by prolonged bouts of North Korean bolshiness, to produce the accord. It paves the way for international nuclear inspectors to return to North Korea and sets out longer-term goals of dismantling the North's nuclear facilities, establishing normal relations between North Korea and America and securing a permanent peace on the Korean peninsula, where the war of 1950-53 is not yet officially over. 
The six-day round of talks that produced the agreement almost foundered over North Korean demands for bigger pledges of aid. But there were signs before it began that America and North Korea were in a mood for compromise. Their negotiators held unusual one-on-one talks in Berlin in January after the collapse of the previous round in December. The discussions in Germany appeared to ease one of North Korea's worries: America's pressure since 2005 on a bank in Macau, Banco Delta Asia, which the Treasury Department said was involved in illicit North Korean financial dealings. This resulted in the freezing of North Korean funds worth $24m, not a paltry sum for a country desperately short of foreign currency. To avoid similar reprisals from America, other banks began shunning North Korea. 
America's negotiator, Christopher Hill, said he told the other parties in Beijing (China, Japan, Russia and South Korea) that America would ""resolve"" the sanctions issue within 30 days. He did not say what this meant, but probably at least some of the North Korean funds will be deemed legitimate and unfrozen. According to the agreement, America will also begin taking steps to remove North Korea from its list of countries that sponsor terrorism and to lift trade sanctions that have been in place since the Korean war. 
America is clearly trying to avoid a showdown with the North. The agreement makes no explicit mention of nuclear weapons, the actual dismantling of nuclear facilities or disposal of nuclear materials. Nor does it explicitly require North Korea to admit the existence of a programme to enrich uranium (presumably for use in nuclear weapons) which the Americans have accused the North Koreans of operating in secret. It was American anger over the alleged uranium project--which American officials said the North Koreans admitted to but later denied--that led to the breakdown in 2002 of a nuclear accord reached eight years earlier. 
Gary Samore, a former senior American official who helped negotiate the 1994 agreement, says the Bush administration--once cynical about that accord--has now made a ""fundamental about-face"". He thinks the present deal could have been reached long before North Korea conducted its nuclear test. But he says it is still useful, making it less likely that North Korea will resume nuclear testing and freeing America to focus on the Middle East. 
The agreement requires North Korea to ""shut down and seal for the purpose of eventual abandonment"" its nuclear facilities at Yongbyon, 87km (54 miles) north of Pyongyang. It must do so within 60 days (in 1994 the North Koreans were given only a month). The Yongbyon facilities include a 5MW graphite-moderated reactor and a plant used to reprocess spent nuclear fuel from this reactor, including the extraction from it of weapons-grade plutonium. 
In return, North Korea will be sent aid ""equivalent to"" about 50,000 tonnes of fuel oil, also within 60 days. This is the same amount that was sent to North Korea in 1994 as an initial reward for signing that year's agreement. It envisages a further package of economic, energy and humanitarian assistance to the value of some 950,000 tonnes of heavy fuel oil (about $250m at current prices). This is to be disbursed as North Korea carries out eventual commitments to declare all its nuclear programmes and disable its nuclear facilities. 
Synchronised sacrifice
This time the Americans clearly wanted to avoid one of the biggest pitfalls of the 1994 accord, namely its requirement that North Korea should receive massive energy aid over a period of several years before having to dismantle its nuclear facilities and dispose of all of its weapons-grade plutonium. That deal called on America to organise the construction in North Korea of two light-water nuclear reactors (less proliferation-prone than the Yongbyon complex), and arrange the shipping of around 500,000 tonnes of fuel oil a year to North Korea until the completion of the project.
Only after that (2003 was the target date, but this slipped to 2009 before the project was abandoned) was North Korea obliged to dismantle the Yongbyon nuclear facilities and dispose of its fuel in a way that did not require reprocessing it inside North Korea. The regime had to provide the UN's International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) with a full account of its nuclear stockpiles only after a ""significant portion"" of the light-water reactor project had been completed. That moment never came, despite total spending of more than $2 billion on fuel oil and the aborted light-water reactors. 
American officials say that, under the new agreement, aid will be provided in tandem with North Korean progress towards declaring and disabling its nuclear programmes. ""The sooner they get these actions done the sooner they get the fuel oil,"" said Mr Hill. But the new agreement has obvious flaws, too. It does not talk about dismantling. It uses only the more ambiguous terms ""abandonment"" and ""disablement""--leaving open the possibility that North Korea may try to insist on keeping its nuclear infrastructure largely intact. Ominously, North Korea's state-run news agency said the offer of aid equivalent to 1m tonnes of fuel oil was made in connection with North Korea's ""temporary suspension of the operation of its nuclear facilities"". That is hardly how the other parties interpret the document. 
The return of IAEA inspectors could pose another problem. The inspectors, who had been monitoring the Yongbyon facilities since the 1994 agreement, were expelled from North Korea in December 2002. The new deal says North Korea has to invite them back within the first 60-day period to carry out verification work ""as agreed between"" the IAEA and North Korea. But it is far from clear how freely North Korea will let the inspectors operate. 
The IAEA will want to verify how much of Yongbyon's spent fuel has been reprocessed since 2003 (all 8,000 of the reactor's spent fuel rods, the North Koreans have said, enough for half a dozen bombs). It will also want to know how much was reprocessed before the 1994 agreement (enough for a couple more bombs, the Americans think). Then there is the suspected uranium-enrichment project: tricky to inspect, since the Americans are not even sure where it might be. 
This agreement, unlike the one made in 1994, makes no mention of North Korea's commitment to the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT), from which it withdrew in 2003. In a statement agreed on by the six parties in September 2005, North Korea pledged to return to the NPT ""at an early date"". But then, furious at America's action against the Macau bank, it refused to take part in further talks until last December. By that time it had not only conducted a nuclear explosion but also, in July 2006, long- and medium-range missile tests. These raised fears of possible attempts by North Korea to make nuclear missiles that could reach Japan and America. 
In Washington, some portray the latest deal as a judicious compromise. Others call it a reckless abandonment of principle. John Bolton, Mr Bush's ex-ambassador to the UN, told CNN that the deal was ""very bad...It sends exactly the wrong signal to would-be proliferators around the world: if you hold out long enough and wear down the State Department negotiators, eventually you get rewarded."" 
Mr Bush retorted that Mr Bolton was ""flat wrong"". But to many, the ex-ambassador's words rang true. The fate of the 1994 deal clearly demonstrated North Korea's unreliability. That agreement did succeed in preventing further plutonium production at Yongbyon for eight years (as well as the completion of two much bigger graphite moderated reactors: one 50MW facility in Yongbyon and a 200MW one in Taechon 20km away). But by 2000 the Americans suspected the North Koreans of pursuing their alleged secret uranium enrichment project with the help of Pakistan's top nuclear scientist, Abdul Qadeer Khan. 
Pressure from big neighbours
American officials say the new agreement is different. Unlike the 1994 pact, this one involves not just America and North Korea but four other regional powers, including China--North Korea's biggest supplier of food and fuel. This, in theory, puts more pressure on North Korea to keep its end of the bargain. Tony Snow, Mr Bush's spokesman, says the other parties to the deal ""have made it pretty clear"" that if the North Koreans cheat, ""they're going to take action against them."" 
North Korea's leader, Kim Jong Il, probably believes that a bomb is the best guarantee of his regime's survival, so he may cheat anyway. Mr Bolton recently argued, in an interview with the American Interest, that the way to get rid of North Korea's nuclear weapons was ""regime change"". But there is little appetite, either in Washington or Beijing, for such a radical approach. In Congress, Mr Bush is unlikely to face big opposition to the accord. Much of the aid will be supplied not by American taxpayers but by China, South Korea and Russia--and Russia announced, on February 14th, that it would also write off most of North Korea's $8 billion debt to Moscow. 
In Japan there could be stronger objections. Because North Korea has not yet come clean about all the Japanese nationals it kidnapped in the 1970s and 1980s (to help train North Korean spies), Japan is refusing to contribute to the aid package. The prime minister, Shinzo Abe, owes what little popularity he has left to his tough stance on the abduction issue. At the same time, prolonged refusal to provide aid could isolate Japan from other participants in the North Korea talks. 
Japan's concerns are not being neglected. The six nations have agreed to set up five working groups to discuss specific issues arising from the agreement. One of these will deal with bilateral relations between Japan and North Korea. Another will look at the normalisation of ties between North Korea and America. But neither is likely to make swift headway. According to Kyodo, a Japanese news agency, Japan's chief cabinet secretary, Yasuhisa Shiozaki, said a day after the agreement was reached that he believed America would not remove North Korea from its terrorism list as long as the issue of the abductees remained unresolved. 
For North Korea, securing normal ties with America is a key objective. In a recent article, Robert Carlin, a former State Department analyst who took part in negotiations with North Korea in the 1990s, and John Lewis, a Stanford University professor, argued that North Korea wanted a ""long-term, strategic relationship"" with America. They said the North Koreans wanted to use this to ""buffer the heavy influence their neighbours already have, or could soon gain, over their small, weak country."" More prosaically, perhaps, better relations with America could be a way of ending the country's isolation and boosting its tattered economy with increased trade and foreign investment. 
America is not being nearly as explicit now as it was in the 1994 agreement about the way ahead for normalised ties with North Korea. Under that pact, America was supposed to reduce barriers to trade and investment within three months. Each side pledged to open a liaison office in the other's capital. Eventually the two sides would upgrade their relations to ambassadorial level. Even under the Clinton administration little of this actually happened. Several Western countries set up embassies or at least appointed non-resident ambassadors, but America and North Korea never got as far as liaison offices (although Madeleine Albright, then secretary of state, paid an unprecedented visit to Pyongyang in 2000). Mr Bush, who has described North Korea as part of an ""axis of evil"" and Mr Kim as a ""pygmy"", will certainly move no faster. 
The new working groups, which are due to meet within 30 days, could rapidly get bogged down in bickering. One of them will specifically address North Korea's nuclear projects. Mr Hill, the American negotiator, said he told the North Koreans repeatedly that America needed to know ""precisely"" what was happening with uranium enrichment. He said a team would be set up within the working group to look at this issue particularly. 
It is not clear, however, how far the Americans will press the point if the North Koreans continue to deny enriching uranium. Some analysts believe that America is less convinced than it once was about how far the project might have progressed. An unclassified CIA estimate distributed to Congress in 2002 said the North was building a plant that could produce enough weapons-grade uranium for two or more nuclear weapons a year when fully operational. It said this could be as soon as the middle of this decade. American officials are no longer sounding quite as alarmed or as certain of their facts. 
The Chinese surprise
China is doubtless delighted that its efforts to broker peace on the Korean peninsula appear at last to be making some headway. One of its aims has been to forge a closer relationship with America and thereby secure greater American co-operation in persuading Taiwan not to move further towards a more explicit declaration of its independence from China. The Americans have been obliging. After the agreement on North Korea was announced, Mr Hill was effusive in his praise for the Chinese. He said it would have been ""a little surprising"" a few years ago to see America and China ""working together the way we are"". Talk, in the early days of Mr Bush's presidency, of China as a ""strategic competitor"" has long since been erased from America's official vocabulary--despite the Pentagon's continuing concerns about China's growing military power.
North Korea has made concessions too. Mr Hill said that it was no longer demanding an immediate revival of the light-water reactor project. The six parties agreed in September 2005 that this project could be discussed ""at an appropriate time"", but North Korea then wanted it made a priority. Without the revival of the reactor project, ""our position is not to even dream of us giving up our nuclear deterrence,"" said a North Korean official at the time. This week's accord, however, makes no mention of it. Neither does it mention any lifting of the UN sanctions imposed in response to the missile and nuclear tests--sanctions which North Korea said were tantamount to a declaration of war.
It is likely that the agreement will further sap the will of some countries to punish North Korea for the tests. Thanks to foot-dragging by China and Russia, the UN sanctions were never very tough to begin with (although China's willingness to subscribe at all was a remarkable departure from its previous reluctance to censure its neighbour). Japan went further, banning all imports from North Korea. But a senior Japanese diplomat, speaking on condition of anonymity, says that trade between China and North Korea appears to have picked up even as Japan's has waned. 
The mood is more upbeat in South Korea. Two days after the agreement, delegates from North and South met in the North Korean city of Kaesong to discuss the possible resumption of ministerial-level talks and humanitarian aid, which the South Koreans suspended last July in response to the missile tests. 
North Korea may feel it has little to lose by appearing to look more reasonable. Despite its nuclear test, it has secured continued engagement with America and other powers. It knows that America has very few cards to play. No one has any illusions that North Korea is about to follow the example of Libya or South Africa and abandon overnight its nuclear-weapons projects. Even the Chinese, who in public at least have usually been doggedly optimistic, have begun to air doubts more openly since last October's nuclear test. Zhang Liangui, of the Communist Party's top training school for officials, wrote in last autumn's edition of China Security, a Washington-based journal, that North Korea would never surrender its nuclear weapons--not, he said, ""for anything"".
The most realistic, limited aim for America would be to persuade North Korea not to make any more nuclear weapons material and to ensure that what has been produced is not given to America's enemies. After the nuclear test, Mr Bush said that such a transfer would be considered a ""grave threat"" to America, but did not say the test itself was a threat. ""Early denuclearisation"" was restated as a headline goal in this week's accord. But North Korea also pledged in 1994 to take ""consistent steps"" towards making the Korean peninsula a nuclear-free zone. There is no sign of that yet.

 North Korea 's leader , Kim Jong Il , probably believes that a bomb is the best guarantee of his regime 's survival , so he may cheat anyway . Mr Bolton recently argued , in an interview with the American Interest , that the way to get rid of North Korea 's nuclear weapons was "" regime change "" . But there is little appetite , either in Washington or Beijing , for such a radical approach . In Congress , Mr Bush is unlikely to face big opposition to the accord . Much of the aid will be supplied not by American taxpayers but by China , South Korea and Russia -- and Russia announced , on February 14th , that it would also write off most of North Korea 's $ 8 billion debt to Moscow . 
 In Japan there could be stronger objections . Because North Korea has not yet come clean about all the Japanese nationals it kidnapped in the 1970s and 1980s ( to help train North Korean spies ) , Japan is refusing to contribute to the aid package . Shinzo Abe , owes what little popularity Shinzo Abe has left to Shinzo Abe's tough stance on the abduction issue . At the same time , prolonged refusal to provide aid could isolate Japan from other participants in the North Korea talks . 
 Japan 's concerns are not being neglected . The six nations have agreed to set up five working groups to discuss specific issues arising from the agreement . One of these will deal with bilateral relations between Japan and North Korea . Another will look at the normalisation of ties between North Korea and America . But neither is likely to make swift headway . According to Kyodo , a Japanese news agency , Japan 's chief cabinet secretary , Yasuhisa Shiozaki , said a day after the agreement was reached that he believed America would not remove North Korea from its terrorism list as long as the issue of the abductees remained unresolved . 
 For North Korea , securing normal ties with America is a key objective . In a recent article , Robert Carlin , a former State Department analyst who took part in negotiations with North Korea in the 1990s , and John Lewis , a Stanford University professor , argued that North Korea wanted a "" long - term , strategic relationship "" with America . They said the North Koreans wanted to use this to "" buffer the heavy influence their neighbours already have , or could soon gain , over their small , weak country . "" More prosaically , perhaps , better relations with America could be a way of ending the country 's isolation and boosting its tattered economy with increased trade and foreign investment . 
 America is not being nearly as explicit now as it was in the 1994 agreement about the way ahead for normalised ties with North Korea . Under that pact , America was supposed to reduce barriers to trade and investment within three months . Each side pledged to open a liaison office in the other 's capital . Eventually the two sides would upgrade their relations to ambassadorial level . Even under the Clinton administration little of this actually happened . Several Western countries set up embassies or at least appointed non - resident ambassadors , but America and North Korea never got as far as liaison offices ( although Madeleine Albright , then secretary of state , paid an unprecedented visit to Pyongyang in 2000 ) . Mr Bush , who has described North Korea as part of an "" axis of evil "" and Mr Kim as a "" pygmy "" , will certainly move no faster . 
 The new working groups , which are due to meet within 30 days , could rapidly get bogged down in bickering . One of them will specifically address North Korea 's nuclear projects . Mr Hill , the American negotiator , said he told the North Koreans repeatedly that America needed to know "" precisely "" what was happening with uranium enrichment . He said a team would be set up within the working group to look at this issue particularly . 
 It is not clear , however , how far the Americans will press the point if the North Koreans continue to deny enriching uranium . Some analysts believe that America is less convinced than it once was about how far the project might have progressed . An unclassified CIA estimate distributed to Congress in 2002 said the North was building a plant that could produce enough weapons - grade uranium for two or more nuclear weapons a year when fully operational . It said this could be as soon as the middle of this decade . American officials are no longer sounding quite as alarmed or as certain of their facts . 
 The Chinese surprise 
 China is doubtless delighted that its efforts to broker peace on the Korean peninsula appear at last to be making some headway . One of its aims has been to forge a closer relationship with America and thereby secure greater American co - operation in persuading Taiwan not to move further towards a more explicit declaration of its independence from China . The Americans have been obliging . After the agreement on North Korea was announced , Mr Hill was effusive in his praise for the Chinese . He said it would have been "" a little surprising "" a few years ago to see America and China "" working together the way we are "" . Talk , in the early days of Mr Bush 's presidency , of China as a "" strategic competitor "" has long since been erased from America 's official vocabulary -- despite the Pentagon 's continuing concerns about China 's growing military power . 
 North Korea has made concessions too . Mr Hill said that it was no longer demanding an immediate revival of the light - water reactor project . The six parties agreed in September 2005 that this project could be discussed "" at an appropriate time "" , but North Korea then wanted it made a priority . Without the revival of the reactor project , "" our position is not to even dream of us giving up our nuclear deterrence , "" said a North Korean official at the time . This week 's accord , however , makes no mention of it . Neither does it mention any lifting of the UN sanctions imposed in response to the missile and nuclear tests -- sanctions which North Korea said were tantamount to a declaration of war . 
 It is likely that the agreement will further sap the will of some countries to punish North Korea for the tests . Thanks to foot - dragging by China and Russia , the UN sanctions were never very tough to begin with ( although China 's willingness to subscribe at all was a remarkable departure from its previous reluctance to censure its neighbour ) . Japan went further , banning all imports from North Korea . But a senior Japanese diplomat , speaking on condition of anonymity , says that trade between China and North Korea appears to have picked up even as Japan 's has waned . 
 The mood is more upbeat in South Korea . Two days after the agreement , delegates from North and South met in the North Korean city of Kaesong to discuss the possible resumption of ministerial - level talks and humanitarian aid , which the South Koreans suspended last July in response to the missile tests . 
 North Korea may feel it has little to lose by appearing to look more reasonable . Despite its nuclear test , it has secured continued engagement with America and other powers . It knows that America has very few cards to play . No one has any illusions that North Korea is about to follow the example of Libya or South Africa and abandon overnight its nuclear - weapons projects . Even the Chinese , who in public at least have usually been doggedly optimistic , have begun to air doubts more openly since last October 's nuclear test . Zhang Liangui , of the Communist Party 's top training school for officials , wrote in last autumn 's edition of China Security , a Washington - based journal , that North Korea would never surrender its nuclear weapons -- not , he said , "" for anything "" . 
 The most realistic , limited aim for America would be to persuade North Korea not to make any more nuclear weapons material and to ensure that what has been produced is not given to America 's enemies . After the nuclear test , Mr Bush said that such a transfer would be considered a "" grave threat "" to America , but did not say the test itself was a threat . "" Early denuclearisation "" was restated as a headline goal in this week 's accord . But North Korea also pledged in 1994 to take "" consistent steps "" towards making the Korean peninsula a nuclear - free zone . There is no sign of that yet .

IF AT first you don't succeed, try, try again. It was third time lucky for Toshihiko Fukui, the governor of the Bank of Japan (BoJ), in his bid to raise interest rates. In December and then again in January, he had failed to persuade enough of the BoJ's nine-member monetary-policy board to vote for an increase. But on February 21st, after hours of haggling with fellow members concerned about the economy's fragile recovery, he got his reward at last. The vote was eight to one in favour of raising the bank's benchmark rate by a quarter of a percentage point, to 0.5%. It has not been that high for more than eight years.
Japan's rates are still the skimpiest in the rich world, a fact not lost on international investors. They have been borrowing heavily in yen and putting the proceeds into more remunerative assets, such as antipodean bonds (see page 88). This carry trade, as it is called, has cheapened Japan's currency, much to the chagrin of American carmakers and European policymakers. A quarter-point rise will do little to deter the traders, but it might appease Japan's foreign critics.
This international carry-on is, however, the last thing on Mr Fukui's mind. This week was his final chance to sneak a rate rise past politicians in his own country, before a season of heavy politicking begins. The government, led by Shinzo Abe, the prime minister, faces a big round of local elections in April and a fiercely contested Upper House election scheduled for July. It did not welcome this week's decision, but it would have fought much harder against a spring hike that would have embarrassed its candidates on the stump.
As it was, Mr Abe's hatchet-men had to be restrained from the same heavy-handed methods that prevented a rate rise last time. Chastened by the global reaction, his ruling Liberal Democratic Party realised it had overstepped the mark by bullying the central bank so overtly. It will take the BoJ a long time to recover its international credibility as an independent custodian of Japanese monetary policy. 
Amid all of this political teeth-gnashing, Mr Fukui has been anxious to wean Japan off its addiction to cheap money. He does not want to repeat the bank's mistakes of the 1980s, when its lax monetary policy created a bubble economy. The collapse of that bubble brought the country's banking system to its knees and condemned Japan to 15 years of deflation. To prevent anything like that happening again, Mr Fukui has insisted that the bank adopt a more forward-looking approach, instead of having to react hastily to news from the market.
A year ago the BoJ declared deflation dead and ended its five-year experiment with ""quantitative easing"", which involved flooding the market with excess liquidity. Confident that the worst was behind it, the bank raised rates last July from zero to 0.25%. Ever since, the governor has been itching to raise them again--in order to return a measure of normality to monetary affairs. In Japan ""normality"" means steering interest rates gradually to somewhere around 2%.
The BoJ has been held back until now by the choppy state of the Japanese economy. After a particularly bleak third quarter, when it eked out annualised growth of just 0.3%, the fourth-quarter numbers announced last week came as welcome relief. For the three months to December, the economy grew at an annual rate of 4.8%, its fastest pace in three years. Much of the gain was thanks to stronger personal spending, which was up by an annualised 1.1%. This was mainly a rebound from the previous quarter, when spending fell by much the same amount. But it still cheered the BoJ no end.
The bank is counting on consumption, which accounts for 55% of Japanese GDP, to become the locomotive of the economy. Households are certainly spending what they have. According to the OECD, Japan's household saving rate has fallen by over eight percentage points since 1998, a deeper plunge than America's. The country's households now fail to dispose of just 2.9% of their disposable income.
Unfortunately, that income is not yet rising as quickly as it might. The weak yen and low interest rates have helped companies make record profits, but the money is failing to filter through into pay-packets. No longer protected by import restrictions or indulged by docile Japanese consumers, corporate Japan is feeling the hot breath of global competition on its own doorstep for the first time. Under the circumstances, companies are showing themselves remarkably reluctant to spend on anything other than productivity-boosting plant and equipment.
Thus even as Mr Fukui fears a return of the bubbly 1980s, others fret about a rerun of August 2000, when the BoJ raised rates prematurely, killing off a nascent recovery and deepening Japan's deflation. The economy has enjoyed five years of continuous growth since then--technically the longest boom since the second world war. But it is still haunted by falling prices. Excluding food, Japan's consumer inflation was only 0.1% in the year to December, down from 0.2% in November. And retreating energy costs may yet snuff out even these faint, inflationary embers.
But Mr Fukui's sights are set further ahead. He makes policy according to the inflation outlook about two years down the road. Over that period, Japan's recovering economy will surely begin to press against its supply-side limits, pushing up wages and prices. Shareholders certainly seem optimistic. After the bank's decision, the Topix stockmarket index closed at a 15-year record, hitting heights not seen since Japan's slide into deflation. Perhaps Mr Fukui's forward-looking policy has something to look forward to.","The central bank 's governor finally gets his way

SIX months ago Japan, whose leaders have often been dull political ciphers, celebrated an unaccustomed transition: the handover of power from a confident, reforming prime minister, Junichiro Koizumi, to an assertive, seemingly capable successor, Shinzo Abe. Mr Koizumi had pulled the economy out of its slump, and built up respect abroad. Japan may have failed last year to win the permanent seat on the United Nations Security Council that it covets, but its diplomats, aid workers and (in modest but useful numbers) its soldiers, sailors and airmen are now ever more routinely deployed--and appreciated--in troublespots and disaster zones from Asia and Africa to the Middle East. Mr Abe has talked about his fellow citizens taking new pride in their ""beautiful country"". 
So they should. But sadly for those who expected better from Mr Abe, he seems to think he can build pride in the future on untruths about Japan's past.
Mr Abe started promisingly enough. By adopting a more subtle approach towards China and South Korea he undid much of the damage Mr Koizumi had caused by his stubborn visits to the Yasukuni shrine honouring Japan's war dead (where the souls of some convicted war criminals have also been ""enshrined"" at the request of their families). Then last week he squandered all the goodwill. Planting his own feet in the mire of imperial Japan's wartime history, he questioned whether the 200,000 or so ""comfort women"" (from Korea, the Philippines, China, Taiwan, Indonesia, Burma and elsewhere) herded into the system of brothels run by the Japanese Imperial Army had really been coerced into their sexual servitude. Strictly speaking, Mr Abe said, there was no evidence of that.
Is he deaf? The first-hand evidence has mounted since some of the women courageously started breaking their silence, after decades of shame, in the early 1990s. More testified recently at hearings in America's House of Representatives, where efforts are under way to pass a resolution calling on Japan to make a full apology, and where some of the victims explained, painfully, just how wartime sex slavery was for them. There would be more evidence too, if successive Japanese governments had not buried it in closed files or destroyed it.
Why pick this shameful fight? Other blunders have left Mr Abe dependent on his party's noisy ultra-conservatives (see page 67). Resentful even of Japan's past carefully parsed apologies for its wartime aggression, a group is now campaigning to overturn a 1993 statement by a cabinet official, noticeably unsupported by the parliament of the day, that for the first time accepted the army's role in setting up the brothels.
The past is your country too

But six decades on, deliberate amnesia is unworthy of modern, democratic Japan. Shame on you, Mr Abe.","Shinzo Abe's picks a shameful fight over the organised rape of thousands of women 
 SIX months ago Japan , whose leaders have often been dull political ciphers , celebrated an unaccustomed transition : the handover of power from a confident , reforming prime minister , Junichiro Koizumi , to Shinzo Abe . Mr Koizumi had pulled the economy out of its slump , and built up respect abroad . Japan may have failed last year to win the permanent seat on the United Nations Security Council that it covets , but its diplomats , aid workers and ( in modest but useful numbers ) its soldiers , sailors and airmen are now ever more routinely deployed -- and appreciated -- in troublespots and disaster zones from Asia and Africa to the Middle East . Shinzo Abe has talked about Shinzo Abe's fellow citizens taking new pride in their "" beautiful country "" . 
 So they should . But sadly for those who expected better from Shinzo Abe , Shinzo Abe seems to think Shinzo Abe can build pride in the future on untruths about Japan 's past . 
 Shinzo Abe started promisingly enough . By adopting a more subtle approach towards China and South Korea Shinzo Abe undid much of the damage Mr Koizumi had caused by his stubborn visits to the Yasukuni shrine honouring Japan 's war dead ( where the souls of some convicted war criminals have also been "" enshrined "" at the request of their families ) . Then last week Shinzo Abe squandered all the goodwill . Planting Shinzo Abe's own feet in the mire of imperial Japan 's wartime history , Shinzo Abe questioned whether the 200,000 or so "" comfort women "" ( from Korea , the Philippines , China , Taiwan , Indonesia , Burma and elsewhere ) herded into the system of brothels run by the Japanese Imperial Army had really been coerced into their sexual servitude . Strictly speaking , Shinzo Abe said , there was no evidence of that . 
 Is Shinzo Abe deaf ? The first - hand evidence has mounted since some of the women courageously started breaking their silence , after decades of shame , in the early 1990s . More testified recently at hearings in America 's House of Representatives , where efforts are under way to pass a resolution calling on Japan to make a full apology , and where some of the victims explained , painfully , just how wartime sex slavery was for them . There would be more evidence too , if successive Japanese governments had not buried it in closed files or destroyed it . 
 Why pick this shameful fight ? Other blunders have left Shinzo Abe dependent on Shinzo Abe's party 's noisy ultra - conservatives ( see page 67 ) . Resentful even of Japan 's past carefully parsed apologies for its wartime aggression , a group is now campaigning to overturn a 1993 statement by a cabinet official , noticeably unsupported by the parliament of the day , that for the first time accepted the army 's role in setting up the brothels . 
 The past is your country too 
 What the brothel survivors want is that full apology from Japan ; they refuse to be fobbed off with offers of money instead from a private fund . By questioning their testimony -- in effect , calling them liars -- Shinzo Abe has instead added modern insult to past injury . But the damage goes wider .

THE gossip-mill is grinding away, and the man whose career could soon pop out the other end in fragments is none other than Shinzo Abe. When he was elected leader of the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP), and hence as Japan's prime minister, last September he won by a landslide, and was hailed as a youthful (52), electorally savvy representative of a new political generation, and, moreover, as one likely to carry on the reform programme associated with his charismatic predecessor, Junichiro Koizumi. Mr Abe began in spectacular fashion, visiting Beijing and Seoul during his first days in office and thus warming up relations that had become damagingly frosty under Mr Koizumi. Since then, however, the only spectacular feature has been his decline.
That decline may explain why on March 1st Mr Abe chose to undo much of what he had achieved through his October visits to Beijing and Seoul, by publicly denying one of the many Chinese and Korean grievances: that Japan's Imperial Army forced hundreds of thousands of women, mostly Chinese and Korean, into prostitution during the 1930s and 1940s. 
Not all of those euphemistically termed ""comfort women"" were enslaved: some were already prostitutes, and others had been sold into bondage by their families. But many say they were kidnapped, enslaved and raped. Their testimony, plus documents unearthed in military archives, forced the Japanese government in 1993 to acknowledge responsibility. Now Mr Abe has said that there is no ""historical proof"" that coercion was involved. In other words, that the women are liars. 
This revealed Mr Abe's true colours, as a conservative politician who has long taken a revisionist view of Japan's 20th-century history. The statement was prompted by an effort by fellow LDP conservatives to force a bill through the Diet (parliament) overturning the government's 1993 statement (which the Diet never ratified). They were responding to moves in America's Congress to condemn Japan over the sex-slavery issue. A strong prime minister might have resisted taking a position on such a sensitive matter. Mr Abe, however, is desperate to shore up his party base.
After his groundbreaking visits to China and South Korea last October, and no doubt helped by North Korea's nuclear test the very day he left Beijing, the new prime minister's approval rating was in the high 70s. Now it has slumped below 40%. That is far from disastrous, by the low standards of the ten forgettable prime ministers Japan endured between 1987 and 2001. But it is poor by the standards of the starry Mr Koizumi, who took office in that year and remained popular for most of his five-year term. And it is dangerous for two bigger reasons: there are local elections for prefectural governors and city mayors in April, and a critical set of elections for parliament's Upper House in July, in which the government's majority could be at stake; and there is a mood for revenge among the many older Liberal Democrats who feel Mr Abe leapfrogged them to gain the leadership last September.
The Japanese public has turned against Mr Abe not because of foreign policy or historical debates but for economic reasons. For all the government's boasts that Japan is enjoying its longest period of growth since 1945, the Japanese are not feeling much benefit in their purses and wallets. The boast is true only if you ignore deflation, and while ordinary Japanese like falling prices, they do not like the fact that their incomes have risen only slowly--as much because of longer hours worked as because of higher wages. In nominal terms (ie, not adjusted for price changes), Japanese output remains below that of 1997. Recent economic growth has produced record company profits, but a tight labour market has not seen wages rise much. In this respect, things were no better under Mr Koizumi, but at least he seemed to be doing something about it by shaking things up. By comparison, Mr Abe looks clueless.
Dreaming of Lionheart
Actually, his problem is subtler than mere cluelessness. He is torn between dealing with the politically potent topic of inequality--in an ageing Japan, the income gap is widening--and making further reforms to encourage future growth. The only thing he has done so far has made both problems worse, however: his government clamped down on the interest rates chargeable by consumer-finance companies on loans to Japan's poorest borrowers. This looked popular, but some say it has choked off their borrowing and helped to depress consumer spending. 
Worse still, when he has had a political clue it has led him in the wrong direction. Mr Koizumi pulled off the remarkable trick of attacking his own political party, eventually kicking out LDP Diet members when they rebelled against his flagship programme of postal privatisation. That laid the ground for his triumph in the 2005 general election. Mr Abe, keen to curry favour with his party's old guard, has now readmitted 11 of the rebels. At a stroke, that has changed his public odour from breath of fresh air to the usual LDP halitosis.
Whether he will actually be dumped, however, depends on how badly the LDP fares in the July Upper House elections. Fortunately for Mr Abe, the opposition Democratic Party of Japan is also in disarray, with its leader, Ichiro Ozawa, in poor health and at war with his own colleagues. Yet that may not save Mr Abe, such is the mood against him. Strange stories have been circulating about how cabinet ministers have so little respect for him that they do not bother to stand up when he enters the room. The rival most often mentioned as his budding successor is Taro Aso, the bumptious foreign minister, who is also a conservative and currently cuts a more dashing figure than his boss. 
Another name, though, is increasingly being whispered: Junichiro Koizumi. There is no real prospect of tempting him back, at least not yet, for the great man is said to be having far too much fun as Japan's most eligible bachelor.

WHEN he signed a security pact with Australia this week, Shinzo Abe, the Japanese prime minister, at a stroke doubled the number of Japan's allies. Until now, Japan has had formal security ties only with America, under whose protection Japan, with a pacifist constitution, has sat since the second world war.
Even if it falls well short of a mutual-defence treaty, to some Australians the agreement signed by John Howard in Tokyo on March 13th is unwarranted. After all, Japan came close to invading their country during the war; Australian prisoners-of-war were brutally treated in Japanese camps; and only a couple of weeks ago Mr Abe had brought ignominy upon himself by denying that foreign ""comfort women"" had been coerced into working in wartime military brothels. Elderly Australian women are among those who have testified otherwise. Yet the world moves on and in Mr Howard's view ""Australia has no better friend or more reliable partner within the Asia-Pacific region than Japan."" Mr Abe spoke of a ""shared destiny"". 
So if it is now important that the two countries be allies, the natural question is, against whom? To ask this, both sides insist with prim faces, is entirely to miss the point. Co-operation between the two countries has deepened on several levels. Until last July, Australian troops had protected Japanese ones doing reconstruction work in southern Iraq. Nearer to home, peacekeeping troops have worked side-by-side in Cambodia and Timor-Leste. 
Alexander Downer, the Australian foreign minister whose own father was a prisoner of the Japanese for more than three years, talks up their co-operation in disaster assistance after the Indian Ocean tsunami of late 2004. The two countries' aid programmes in Asia have shared objectives. Thus the agreement's provisions for regular meetings involving the two sides' foreign and defence ministers, joint military exercises, and more formal arrangements for sharing information would all improve humanitarian missions. 
A security agreement is a symbolic way of building up those new aspects of the relationship, says Mr Downer. The two sides will also negotiate a free-trade agreement to strengthen economic ties. All good stuff. But the louder the denials from both sides, the more evident is the main catalyst for the security pact: the rise of China.
That may come as a surprise to some. Australia has often had to defend itself against charges from human-rights groups and others of sacrificing democratic principles for profits in its dealings with China, which has an inexhaustible appetite for the commodities, such as iron ore and uranium, that Australia is able to supply. But as an Australian diplomat explains: ""China is a good, constructive commercial partner, but in terms of ideas and values, it will never be anywhere near as close to us as Japan. Its quite clear: Japan is our best friend in Asia.""
Australia's security posture has long been a cause for wariness in China, particularly because of its alliance with America and the possibility that Australia might come to America's aid in a war with China over Taiwan. Still, as long as the new pact does not imply Australian support for Japan in its territorial disputes with China in the East China Sea, China's government will attempt to hide its displeasure. Economic ties come first.
As for Mr Abe, the pact is of a piece with a more robust foreign policy for Japan that was begun by his predecessor, Junichiro Koizumi. Before sending troops to Iraq, Mr Koizumi had also dispatched supply ships from Japan's so-called Self-Defence Forces to the Indian Ocean to help with the war in Afghanistan in 2001. 
Since he came to office last September, Mr Abe has redoubled Mr Koizumi's commitment to Japan's alliance with the United States, but wants to do more than just shelter under America's wing. He has pushed for faster deployment of missile-defence systems in the face of North Korean provocation. He has turned the Japanese Defence Agency into a full ministry, with a seat in the cabinet. And he wants the pacifist article nine of the constitution to be revised. Mr Abe has sought a new partnership with India, while building security ties with South-East Asia. 
It all amounts to a strategy of balancing China's geopolitical reach: Japan, in other words, is not about to roll on its back to let China be the region's top dog. Mr Abe's domestic ineptitude may mean a short term in office, as the ruling Liberal Democratic Party and its coalition partner face crucial elections for parliament's upper house in July. Even if so, Japan's emerging regional posture is likely to survive him.","But China has reason to suspect Japan 's military flirtation with Australia

""LET us imagine"", says Lin Chong-pin, president of Taiwan's Foundation on International and Cross-Strait Studies, ""how President Hu Jintao in his dreams might wish the opening of his Beijing Olympics to be."" Not only, says Mr Lin, will he have brought the world's finest athletes there, but also its artists and celebrities. So far, so plausible. He will also have, on his right hand, the leader of the communists' civil-war foe, the Kuomintang, newly elected in the spring of 2008 as president of Taiwan. And on his left a beaming Dalai Lama, thankful to be back on Chinese soil once more after an exile of nearly 50 years. ""It would"", says Mr Lin, ""be the heavenly dynasty all over again, and the barbarians coming to worship."" That this happy vision, though technically possible, is still implausible provides insights into the paradox of China's rise.
On the one hand, China appears over the past decade to have signed up wholeheartedly to an international order, of globalised trade and rules-based relations among states, that was not of its making--even as America, the chief architect of that order, has partly walked away from it, with its ""coalitions of the willing"" and growing opposition to unfettered trade.
China has signed up because it realises it is probably globalisation's greatest beneficiary. This, more than anything, explains the country's remarkable levelheadedness in its dealings with the United States ever since the last crisis in bilateral relations, in 2001, when an American spy plane collided with a Chinese fighter. The levelheadedness has paid off. For as American power has been distracted in the Middle East, so Chinese power has moved up. 
A touch of the diabolic
On the other hand, Chinese intentions about what to do with its power in the long run remain deeply ambiguous. If China sees its constellation as heavenly--and the Chinese, like the Americans and the French, have a sense of manifest destiny--neighbours see hints of the diabolic.
Perhaps the growth in the military budget reflects China's growing wealth and prestige, along with a desire to protect its rising shipments of oil and other commodities: the country seems bent on building a blue-water navy. Understandable, perhaps, within China's terms of reference, to have a military strength capable of deterring Taiwan from declaring independence. But why missiles with a range to hit Japan? Why, in January, did China test-fire a rocket to destroy an old weather satellite, when it insists no one is more committed to the peaceful development of space? And why, last autumn, did a Chinese submarine suddenly pop up next to the Kitty Hawk, an American aircraft carrier? 
Equally, what is China doing building roads, ports and pipelines in Myanmar and Pakistan, connecting west and south-west China with the Bay of Bengal and the Indian Ocean? The point could simply be to help the development of backward Chinese regions. But these links could equally serve as future supply routes for the Chinese navy. For Brahma Chellaney, at the Centre for Policy Research in Delhi, the conclusion is plain: along with the planned extension of the new Qinghai-Lhasa railway, which could in theory bring military material up quickly to the Tibetan border, ""it amounts to a strategic squeeze of India.""
India's government is less willing than some of its intellectuals to see China's actions as a strategic squeeze. Nevertheless, it is trying to balance China's advances. Noting that the West's abandonment of Myanmar in the absence of democratic change opened the way for Chinese influence, India is trying to make its own advances to the awful regime there. ASEAN is doing the same. 
Thus China's rise is quietly bringing about an opposite, if not yet equal, reaction. Japan's relations with China are much improved since the anti-Japanese riots two years ago sparked by visits by the then prime minister, Junichiro Koizumi, to Yasukuni, Tokyo's militarist war shrine. As soon as Shinzo Abe became prime minister last September, he made a fence-mending trip to Beijing. North Korea's nuclear games may also have pushed Japan and China closer. 
As for Taiwan, China currently calculates that in next year's presidential election a pliable Ma Ying-jeou, the KMT's favoured son, will succeed the independence-minded Chen Shui-bian of the Democratic Progressive Party. Mr Ma's election prospects, however, have got murkier since his indictment in February over alleged misuse of funds during his time as Taipei's mayor. And even if he does win, China may face disappointments. 
It believes it has an understanding with the KMT (whose elder statesman, Lien Chan, visited the mainland in a groundbreaking trip two years ago) that Taiwan is a part of China. Certainly, Mr Ma says he will push for closer economic co-operation and wants Taiwan to be a ""peacemaker not a troublemaker"". But he also says the Taiwanese want to keep the status quo--in other words, a sovereign Taiwan that is independent in all but name. ""We will not pursue talks on reunification,"" Mr Ma insists. ""The matter will have to wait until the mainland becomes democratic and prosperous.""
The home front
Doubts about China's intentions, however, stem perhaps less from its actions overseas than the values that underpin its behaviour at home. After all, China's political and economic affairs are still run with what is essentially a Leninist apparatus of state. The state's instinct is to co-opt those within the empire who question the political orthodoxy--or if that does not work, to deal with them harshly. Thus the Dalai Lama is vilified, and Tibetans are demeaned in their own land. Over Taiwan, China reserves the right to nuke what it says are its own people.
As the Dalai Lama puts it: ""Mr Hu's constant emphasis on a 'harmonious society' suggests that something is missing."" China is wracked by social inequality, environmental damage and government corruption. Beijing's preparations for the Olympics are a heart-rending metaphor for this. The games have provided a pretext for an orgy of official corruption and cultural vandalism which in a few brief years has all but destroyed a unique historical city. A few scraps have been left for touristic consumption. Beijing's inhabitants have been shunted into tower blocks on the city's edges. In their place rise vast bombastic structures, architects' and politicians' self-indulgences with no civic context.
A constant theme heard from thoughtful Chinese is that China's rise lacks a moral underpinning, and that a moral vacuum lies at the heart of Chinese life. The Dalai Lama puts the blame on the Communist Party's ""radical atheism"" and predicts that ""sooner or later, a spiritual or moral culture will have to come to fill an internal emptiness; externally, there will have to be rule of law, democracy, freedom of the press.""
A slow enriching of both public and private life may already be under way. Non-government organisations to tackle social and environmental issues have grown hugely in number since earlier this decade. Some corners of the press have pushed the frontiers of what they can write about. And across China evidence is growing of a resurgence of spiritual and religious inquiry. 
All the same, raw and volatile forms of nationalism lurk just beneath a usually placid surface. They erupted in 1999 when NATO bombs struck the Chinese embassy in Belgrade during the Kosovo war, and again in anti-Japanese riots in the spring of 2005. Internet chatrooms are full of vituperative anti-foreign sentiment.
The memories of past horrors in China--foreign occupation, civil war, the cultural revolution--have made older Chinese generations into advocates of a peaceful region. All the same, the current leaders ignore popular sentiment at their peril. Passing on the lessons of history to a younger, more nationalistic generation that never experienced horrors at first hand is China's ""big problem"", says Lee Kuan Yew, Singapore's elder statesman.
All this feeds into the neighbours' surviving suspicions about China's intentions, despite a decade-long charm offensive. So long as China is not satisfied within its own borders, how can it be satisfied in the world?
In the long run, this will place limits on Chinese power and influence. It is not just America's allies such as Japan and Taiwan that want it to stick around for a long while yet. ASEAN countries also need the United States to balance China. Singapore recently signed an agreement allowing American forces greater access; Indonesia and America have resumed bilateral military contacts; and Vietnam wants to forge a strategic alliance with its former enemy.
There is also, Thailand's recent military coup notwithstanding, Asia's general embrace of democracy. Michael Green of Georgetown University, a former Asia director at America's National Security Council, sees it as a tremendous potential source of ""soft"" power for America. Whereas China rigidly sticks to its policy of non-interference in the affairs of other nations, ASEAN has moved on. Malaysia's prime minister, Abdullah Badawi, says ASEAN's hallowed principle of non-interference must be ""updated"". A new draft of ASEAN's governing charter says that regional stability rests on ""the active strengthening of democratic values, good governance, the rule of law"", and so on.
Such sentiments around Asia might, at the very least, stand in quiet opposition to Chinese power. But if China embraced some of them for itself, who can guess at the limits to its celestial realm?

SPRING in Japan this year heralds a rash of more than 1,000 local elections across the country: on April 8th some 13 out of Japan's 47 prefectures hold gubernatorial elections, including Tokyo, Hokkaido in the north and Fukuoka in the south. Nearly every prefecture elects a new assembly on the same day. On April 22nd mayoral and municipal-assembly elections take place, along with two closely watched by-elections for the House of Councillors, the upper house of the Diet (national parliament). The results will give a clue about the prospects for the country's governing coalition of the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) and New Komeito when they attempt to keep their majority in crucial upper-house elections in July. A strengthened majority then would be a welcome boost for Shinzo Abe, the prime minister who has seen his popularity slump since he came to office six months ago. Defeat would put Mr Abe's future in question.
The governor's race in Tokyo has a motley collection of candidates that include an inventor who has photographed and analysed every meal he has eaten for the past 35 years. It is seen as the bellwether election. Officially, the LDP does not endorse the two-term incumbent, Shintaro Ishihara. Nor does the opposition Democratic Party of Japan openly back his main challenger, Shiro Asano, a former governor of Miyagi prefecture. Tokyo has many independent-minded voters, and the candidates think that party ties put them off. Yet both parties are putting their organisations behind their respective men. Defeat for Mr Ishihara would be a blow for Mr Abe.
Mr Ishihara, at 74, has offended plenty of constituencies in his long political career. The affronted include: foreigners of every stripe; women beyond child-bearing age, who he says are a drain on the country; schoolteachers who resent his insistence on flag-raising ceremonies each morning; and urban crows whose extermination he ordered after being pecked by one. Yet plenty of Tokyo folk take his straight-talking style as a mark of integrity, even if his clean reputation has recently been tainted by an expenses scandal and whiffs of nepotism.
The governor's latest obsession is perhaps his most divisive. He passionately wants to bring the Olympic games back to Tokyo in 2016, arguing that they will do wonders for the city's infrastructure, prosperity and international reputation. Opponents say that Tokyo, whose 1964 Olympics represented a coming-out party for Japan after the devastation of war, no longer has anything to prove with such a costly proposition. Health care, pensions and schooling are the pressing issues. Most contenders for the governorship, including Mr Asano, oppose the Olympics bid.
Caught up in this debate is the future of the Tsukiji fish market, the world's biggest, with 2,000 tonnes of seafood passing through each day. It is hugely popular with overseas and Japanese visitors, and its gritty verve stands in contrast to many of the capital's sanitised routines. But Mr Ishihara wants to move the market to Toyosu wharf, on reclaimed land three kilometres (two miles) further out in Tokyo bay. Tsukiji will then become the site for a giant Olympics media centre.
Tsukiji was built as the replacement for the fish market that had stood at central Nihonbashi for over 300 years until a huge earthquake in 1923. Hideji Otsuki, the market's city-appointed boss, says that it is now outdated, having been built for rail freight. Today's giant refrigerated lorries have difficulty squeezing in. Meanwhile, the three-wheeled motorised carts used to move boxes of fish about the narrow alleys are forever bumping into each other. 
Many market traders oppose the move. Katsuji Takeda, the owner of a sushi business, says that at a stroke the ""Tsukiji brand"" will be destroyed. City managers proposing the move, he says, are bureaucrats who confuse a sterile distribution centre with the social and commercial vitality of a true market. 
Opposition has recently grown further over the toxic benzene that contaminates the soil at the new site. Tokyo Gas, the utility whose land it was, is removing 2m (6.6 feet) of topsoil, and 2.5m of fresh soil is going on top, but environmentalists say that an earthquake or a tidal surge would bring the benzene straight back up to the surface again. Even Mr Ishihara has agreed to put off a decision about the move until experts have been heard.
Still Mr Ishihara--backed by construction companies drooling over the Tsukiji site, so close to the fashionable heart of Tokyo--seems to be ahead in the election race. Few doubt what will happen to the fish market if he wins. An irony for visiting journalists looking for good stories in 2016: the last visible link with an earlier Tokyo might have made a good story, and they will find themselves literally sitting on it.

THE way the Chinese like to put it, the trip to Beijing last October by Japan's new prime minister, Shinzo Abe, ""broke the ice"". The two countries' relationship had been plunged into the chiller by the provocative visits of Mr Abe's predecessor, Junichiro Koizumi, to Yasukuni, the Tokyo war shrine that glorifies Japan's militarist past. Now, the trip that Wen Jiabao will make to Tokyo and Kyoto on April 11th-13th, the first visit to Japan in more than six years by a Chinese prime minister, will be the ""ice-melter"". Optimism abounds on both sides. But it is wishful thinking to expect the problems between Asia's two biggest powers to be reduced to a few puddles of warm water.
For now, China is determined to do everything to make Mr Wen's trip a success. Take the issue of the so-called ""comfort women"". Mr Abe has in the past month caught himself up in an uncalled-for furore by refusing to admit that the Japanese imperial army coerced Korean, Chinese and other women to work in brothels in the second world war. This managed to offend even Japan's staunch ally, the United States. Yet the Chinese government, usually quick to take historical offence, has studiously ignored the fuss. Indeed, over more recent abductions that Mr Abe cares very deeply about--of ordinary Japanese kidnapped by North Korea during the 1970s and 1980s--Mr Wen himself expresses sympathy for Japanese concerns.
As for the Yasukuni shrine, to which Mr Abe has traditionally been a more committed visitor than has Mr Koizumi, the Chinese believe that they have an understanding from him that he will not go while he is prime minister. Afterwards, says one Chinese policymaker, he can even go and live at Yasukuni, for all the Chinese will care.
If this minimum requirement--no prime ministerial visit, or at least no public one, to Yasukuni--is met, then the Chinese government seems determined to build a new ""strategic partnership"". Japan seems inclined to reciprocate. In a surprisingly short time, a wide range of topics has come up: economic and environmental co-operation; mechanisms to ease territorial disputes in the East China Sea, complicated by possibly large deposits of gas and oil; even confidence-building measures between the two countries' armed forces.
Mr Wen's visit will formalise a new cabinet-level dialogue on economic co-operation. In addition, Japanese firms will be offered the chance to bid for nuclear-power projects, as well as for parts of proposed high-speed railway lines between Beijing and Shanghai, Beijing and Wuhan, and Dalian and Harbin in Manchuria--whose railways imperial Japan once controlled. Japanese investment and know-how will be sought for environmental projects, including on energy efficiency.
The dispute in the East China Sea is potentially explosive. The hydrocarbon deposits fall on both sides of the median line between the two countries that Japan says should be the boundary between their respective exclusive economic zones. China does not recognise the boundary, and is already extracting gas from a field which straddles it. Progress over the dispute appears slow--a seventh round of bilateral talks ended last week in Tokyo. Yet participants say that understandings have been reached in important areas. In particular, China has accepted that the solution lies not in focusing on prickly issues of territoriality, but on joint development of the disputed fields. The haggling is now over precisely which areas should be developed. Meanwhile, Chinese officials say their vessels carefully avoid crossing the disputed boundary. There is talk of establishing a hotline between the Japan Coast Guard and the China National Oceanic Bureau, to co-ordinate search-and-rescue missions in an increasingly crowded sea.
Dates, damn dates
Military relations also appear to be warming. A similar hotline is expected between the two countries' navies, partly in order to prevent incidents such as accidental collisions at sea from escalating. Defence ministers plan reciprocal visits. The official Chinese press also reflects the new warmth. Nanfeng Chuang, a weekly magazine, reported on April 1st that Japan ""naturally"" had concerns about China's military expansion, given its territorial disputes with its neighbour--a departure in the press from the usual claims of a resurgent Japanese militarism. Now there is talk of an official visit to Japan later this year by the Chinese navy, with the prospect (hard, until recently, to imagine) of the five-starred red flag flying in Tokyo Bay.
In a rare honour, Mr Wen has been invited to address Japan's parliament, where he will suggest that China is rising, but along a peaceful incline; he will invite Japan to share it. As well as meeting politicians and Emperor Akihito, Mr Wen has asked to chat to students and farmers. He is also to meet the head of Soka Gakkai, Japan's largest Buddhist organisation, with 8m households. The charm offensive, says a Chinese diplomat, is meant to show people that China has a ""new idea"" about Japan. This is unlikely ever to extend to support for Japan's bid for a permanent seat on the United Nations' Security Council. But with so many other obstacles blocking UNSC reform, that can be overlooked.
China's push for better relations involves some political risk at home--and not least because Mr Abe, having opened to China, has to survive upper-house elections in the summer. The months ahead are studded with sensitive anniversaries related to Japan's wartime depredations in China. Any of these could rekindle the anti-Japanese sentiment that erupted into unruly demonstrations in 2005. China's state media emphasise that this year should be celebrated as the 35th anniversary of ""normalised"" relations with Japan. Yet ordinary people are more likely to note that July 7th will be the 70th anniversary of the start of Japan's all-out invasion, and December 13th that of Japan's worst atrocity in China, the Nanjing massacre. Last month an adviser to China's parliament proposed that September 18th be named as a ""day of national calamity"" because of Japan's occupation of Manchuria beginning on that day in 1931. The icebergs are melting, but historical issues still make up their underwater mass.","A concerted effort to improve relations in the shadow of historical grudges 
 THE way the Chinese like to put it , the trip to Beijing last October by Shinzo Abe's , "" broke the ice "" . The two countries ' relationship had been plunged into the chiller by the provocative visits of Shinzo Abe's predecessor , Junichiro Koizumi , to Yasukuni , the Tokyo war shrine that glorifies Japan 's militarist past . Now , the trip that Wen Jiabao will make to Tokyo and Kyoto on April 11th-13th , the first visit to Japan in more than six years by a Chinese prime minister , will be the "" ice - melter "" . Optimism abounds on both sides . But it is wishful thinking to expect the problems between Asia 's two biggest powers to be reduced to a few puddles of warm water . 
 For now , China is determined to do everything to make Mr Wen 's trip a success . Take the issue of the so - called "" comfort women "" . Shinzo Abe has in the past month caught Shinzo Abe up in an uncalled - for furore by refusing to admit that the Japanese imperial army coerced Korean , Chinese and other women to work in brothels in the second world war . This managed to offend even Japan 's staunch ally , the United States . Yet the Chinese government , usually quick to take historical offence , has studiously ignored the fuss . Indeed , over more recent abductions that Shinzo Abe cares very deeply about -- of ordinary Japanese kidnapped by North Korea during the 1970s and 1980s -- Mr Wen himself expresses sympathy for Japanese concerns . 
 As for the Yasukuni shrine , to which Shinzo Abe has traditionally been a more committed visitor than has Mr Koizumi , the Chinese believe that they have an understanding from Shinzo Abe that Shinzo Abe will not go while Shinzo Abe is prime minister . Afterwards , says one Chinese policymaker , Shinzo Abe can even go and live at Yasukuni , for all the Chinese will care . 
 If this minimum requirement -- no prime ministerial visit , or at least no public one , to Yasukuni -- is met , then the Chinese government seems determined to build a new "" strategic partnership "" . Japan seems inclined to reciprocate . In a surprisingly short time , a wide range of topics has come up : economic and environmental co - operation ; mechanisms to ease territorial disputes in the East China Sea , complicated by possibly large deposits of gas and oil ; even confidence - building measures between the two countries ' armed forces .

SINCE becoming prime minister last September, Shinzo Abe has done plenty of travelling. Straight off, he made a fence-mending trip to China and South Korea, with whom Japan's relations had deteriorated under his predecessor, Junichiro Koizumi. In January he visited Europe, chiefly to emphasise that Japan was a staunch democratic partner on NATO's eastern flank. This week, shortly after visiting Washington for talks with George Bush, he toured the Middle East, the fount of more than three-quarters of Japan's oil.
Mr Abe's men say his travels paint an emerging vision: while the alliance with America remains the cornerstone of Japan's security policy, Mr Abe is also pushing once-passive Japan to pursue its own, more muscular course. For in Asia, says an official, Japan is playing ""a huge great game"" in which it must compete with a rising China and a newly confident Russia for resources, power and prestige.
His first trip as prime minister to meet Mr Bush was overshadowed by Mr Abe's comments, in March, questioning the Japanese army's wartime role in forcing women into military brothels (see next article). Howls of international protest forced him into a sort-of apology. He repeated it to Mr Bush, who ""accepted"" it--as if the president spoke for the victims. This choreographed pas de deux prevented the issue overwhelming all others.
Mr Bush warmly approves of Mr Abe's fence-mending with neighbours who had been antagonised by Mr Koizumi's provocative visits to Yasukuni, Tokyo's war shrine. America needs Chinese co-operation, even leadership, in dealing with a North Korea that went nuclear last October. And in the longer run, it wants to tie China in as a ""responsible stakeholder"" of the international system. Neither goal is served if Japan riles its neighbours with high-handedness over its wartime past.
Mr Abe was welcomed, too, for insisting that Japan should play an ever more energetic role in the alliance. After he left Washington last weekend, Japan's foreign minister, Taro Aso, and the defence minister, Fumio Kyuma, sat down with their American counterparts, Condoleezza Rice and Robert Gates. With North Korea's missiles in mind, the Americans emphasised their country's commitment to defend Japan against conventional and nuclear threats--in effect reaffirming that Japan is protected by America's nuclear umbrella.
America also promised to bring forward the deployment by Japan of two American-made anti-ballistic missile systems. And with a view as much towards China's military rise as the North Korean threat, America even hinted it might sell Japan the advanced F-22 Raptor stealth fighter (though it later backtracked).
Japan is keen to play a greater part in its own defence, including through increased military co-operation. However, this has been hampered by the Japanese government's interpretation of the constitution. In particular, collective self-defence has been ruled out of bounds. As things stand, for instance, Japan may not shoot down a North Korean missile headed for the United States, or come to the aid of an American ship under attack. However, before his American visit Mr Abe's government announced a review of the interpretation.
A right to collective self-defence underpins Mr Abe's broader ambition, which is to ensure that Japan can play a bigger role in international security. As an example of the constraints, Japan's 600 ground troops deployed in Iraq until last year were unable to use force. On May 3rd, the Japanese constitution's 60th anniversary, Mr Abe proposed rewriting it--including perhaps the clause declaring Japan pacifist.
Japan's great game is dressed up in the values of humanitarianism, democracy and the rule of law. It seeks closer ties with democratic India and recently formalised a security alliance of sorts, only Japan's second, with Australia. Mr Aso speaks of an ""arc of freedom and prosperity"" from Japan, swinging through India via moderate Middle Eastern states into Europe. China and Russia, unsurprisingly, see this as a bid to contain them.
However, Mr Abe's trip to the Gulf this week illustrated how pragmatism is lurking behind the facade of Japan's talk of spreading democracy. While China is signing energy deals around the world, cosying up to even the nastiest regimes, Japan's attempts to secure its long-term oil supplies have gone awry. Last autumn the Iranians forced it to cut sharply its stake in the Azadegan oilfield in Iran, in which it had invested much time and money. Shortly after, Japanese stakes in the huge Sakhalin-2 gas project were slashed when the Russian state muscled in. Japanese concessions in Saudi Arabia and Kuwait have also been lost.
So this week Mr Abe sought to restore his country's supply lines. A deal was announced that gives Saudi Arabia oil-storage facilities on Japan's southern island of Okinawa in return for preferential Japanese access to them in emergencies. The Japan Bank for International Co-operation announced a $1 billion loan to Abu Dhabi as a downpayment on long-term oil contracts. Mr Abe did not upset his hosts with any unwelcome talk about democracy but he did propose a more active, ""multi-layered"" relationship with the region, for example offering Japan as an honest broker in the Arab-Israeli conflict. His mixture of idealism and pragmatism, added to a more confident style at home, seems to be doing him some good. For the first time since he came to office, the Nikkei daily reports, the prime minister's hitherto dismal approval ratings have risen.","Shinzo Abe wants a more assertive foreign policy but Japan 's energy dependence is forcing it to be more pragmatic

IN HISTORY, as in politics, it is wise to choose your battles with care. Remarks in March by Japan's prime minister, Shinzo Abe, that appeared to deny the role of Japan's imperial army in coercing between 50,000 and 200,000 women to work in wartime brothels, or ""comfort stations"", across East Asia have landed him in a minefield of criticism from victims and governments, in Asia and beyond. By denying there was coercion by the army--except in the broadest (and mildest) sense--he has dismayed Japan's allies.
Most of the women herded into the brothels were from Korea, China, Taiwan, the Philippines, Indonesia and Myanmar (then Burma), though they included others too. Support has been growing in America for a House of Representatives resolution calling for a profound apology and proper compensation. Japan's own deliberately unofficial fund, established in 1995, had few takers and closed its coffers in March.
On April 27th, while Mr Abe was in Washington, DC, trying to explain himself, at home the country's highest court tossed out two sets of compensation claims--for sexual slavery and for forced labour--arguing that post-war agreements with Japan's neighbours ruled out such claims. But the court also put on record that, in these cases, Japanese soldiers had indeed abducted two teenage Chinese girls and made them work as sex slaves.
Unlike some right-wingers in his own party, Mr Abe says he sticks by a 1993 admission from the then chief cabinet secretary, Yohei Kono, that the imperial army ""was, directly or indirectly, involved"" in setting up and managing wartime brothels. The statement also admitted that ""in many cases"" women were recruited through deception or coercion and that ""administrative/military personnel directly took part in the recruitments.""
Mr Abe, though, has called testimony that soldiers went on a ""hunt"" for victims a ""complete fabrication""--even as some of the women were recounting their experiences. There was ""no evidence"", he said, that women were coerced in the narrow and violent sense into sexual servitude.
Yet a report by America's Congressional Research Service lists evidence from other countries that Japanese military personnel not only set up and ran the brothels but also at times forcibly abducted women and girls to work in them. After the war, a Dutch war-crimes tribunal convicted a number of Japanese army officers of such crimes. Meanwhile a 1994 Dutch government report looking into the fate of a limited number of women and girls of European (mostly Dutch) origin in what is now Indonesia found that 65 were ""most certainly"" forced into prostitution. Japan's government received this report years ago and thus cannot claim ignorance of it.
The worst and most systematic military abuses, the report concludes, took place from mid-1943 to mid-1944. They ended when a colonel from the ministry of war in Tokyo heard of them while visiting internment camps on Java. That's the thing about history: it has its bad and its more honourable parts. Does Mr Abe have the confidence to take a proper look?
Caption: A victim seeks justice","More of the facts will out 
 IN HISTORY , as in politics , it is wise to choose your battles with care . Remarks in March by Shinzo Abe's , that appeared to deny the role of Japan 's imperial army in coercing between 50,000 and 200,000 women to work in wartime brothels , or "" comfort stations "" , across East Asia have landed Shinzo Abe in a minefield of criticism from victims and governments , in Asia and beyond . By denying there was coercion by the army -- except in the broadest ( and mildest ) sense -- Shinzo Abe has dismayed Japan 's allies . 
 Most of the women herded into the brothels were from Korea , China , Taiwan , the Philippines , Indonesia and Myanmar ( then Burma ) , though they included others too . Support has been growing in America for a House of Representatives resolution calling for a profound apology and proper compensation . Japan 's own deliberately unofficial fund , established in 1995 , had few takers and closed its coffers in March . 
 On April 27th , while Shinzo Abe was in Washington , DC , trying to explain Shinzo Abe , at home the country 's highest court tossed out two sets of compensation claims -- for sexual slavery and for forced labour -- arguing that post - war agreements with Japan 's neighbours ruled out such claims .

THE noodle bowl of free-trade agreements (FTAs) in Asia is about to get more tangled. In the past week alone, South Korea began FTA negotiations with the European Union, having struck a deal with the United States in early April. Japan and Australia held a first round of talks aimed at their own agreement. Japan and the Association of South-East Asian Nations (ASEAN) declared that they would seek an FTA by the year's end. And a proposed deal with Thailand went to Japan's Diet (parliament) for approval. Since the fad began at the start of the decade, Asian countries between them have signed more than 70 FTAs.
Yet of all Asian countries, Japan, with the biggest economy, feels least comfortable with the process. It has ratified just four--with Singapore, Mexico, Malaysia and the Philippines. In negotiations with poorer partners, Japan can come across as alternately stingy or overweening.
Now the government is starting to worry that it has been caught napping by China, which has burnished the art of trade diplomacy. As early as 2000, China proposed a free-trade agreement with ASEAN. A deal on trade in goods was signed in 2004 and one on services this year.
More than anything, though, Japan has been jolted by the FTA between America and South Korea. The deal, which has yet to be ratified, would open South Korea to American agriculture exports and investment, while South Korean cars and consumer electronics would go more freely to America. Japan sells much the same kind of things to America, as well as luxury foods to South Korea. So although some officials gloss over the effect on Japan (they argue that a thriving South Korea sucks in Japanese goods), this FTA will increase the competition faced by Japanese exporters in both America and South Korea.
Hence Japan's new urgency for free-trade arrangements. On May 9th private-sector members of the Council on Economic and Fiscal Policy urged the government of Shinzo Abe to instigate free-trade talks with America, followed by the EU. The prime minister's foreign-policy advisers think an FTA with America would deepen Japan's alliance with that country, while keeping the distracted superpower engaged in a region that faces the unpredictable consequences of China's rise and a nuclear North Korea. The council also say that Japan should treble the number of FTAS over the next two years. Some want to reopen long-stalled discussions with South Korea, or even with China.
Such an expansion would not be easy. In Asia, there are historical antagonisms and mutual suspicions to overcome. In America, Japan's competitive cars and the value of the yen (at a 20-year low on a trade-weighted basis) threaten to become political issues again.
But the biggest problem is Japan's coddled farmers. South Korea's new prime minister, Han Duck-soo, recently emphasised that for any bilateral pact to work, Japan would have to open up nine-tenths of its farm trade. Japan now applies tariffs of nearly 800% to all but a tiny amount of imported rice.
Japanese officials think no deal, even with America, would be incentive enough for the government to take on the farm lobby, particularly before upper-house elections in July. Some turn their hopes towards pan-regional discussions as a way to force the issue. China has proposed an FTA among ASEAN, China, Japan and South Korea. Last year, Japan proposed adding India, Australia and New Zealand to the mix. George Bush trumped that in November by advocating a free-trade area spanning the Pacific and covering half the world economy.
Such regional proposals, if given serious backing, would do much to cut through the tangle of Asia's noodle bowl of deals. For now, though, they are all talk. Japanese policymakers insist that a breakthrough on agriculture in the Doha round of global trade talks would compel Japanese leaders to confront the farmers (whose average age is over 60) once and for all. Regrettably, the Doha round seems to be held in indefinite suspension.","Shinzo Abe worries about missing Asia 's banquet of free - trade deals

""WHENEVER there's a new government,"" Hiroshi Saito, president of Mizuho Corporate Bank, part of Japan's second-biggest financial group, says with more than a hint of world-weariness, ""it always announces that Tokyo will be the next international financial centre."" Sure enough, the government of Shinzo Abe, prime minister since last autumn, says that Japan must act quickly to make Japan's financial markets competitive enough to attract global business. This summer it promises to come up with some crisp proposals. These, says Koutaro Tamura, parliamentary secretary responsible for financial services, will be proof of the government's sense of purpose.
The incoming head of the troubled Tokyo Stock Exchange (TSE), Atsushi Saito (no relation of the bank president), who is helping the government draw up its plans, explains the urgency. Though Japan has prospered as a manufacturing power, it can no longer rely on this alone, now that it is sending much manufacturing overseas. With a population that is both ageing and shrinking, Japan's savings must earn more than today's pitiful rates. Better asset allocation can happen only if Tokyo's competitiveness as a financial centre is boosted, attracting international talent.
Tokyo does not stack up well at present. On the one hand, Japan's economy is now out of its long funk, and both stock- and property markets are steadily reviving. The country sits on yen1,500 trillion ($12.5 trillion) of household financial assets. These vast savings and Japan's many listed companies, many of them champions, mean that Tokyo is home to the world's second-biggest stockmarket after New York and hosts easily the biggest in Asia, dwarfing Hong Kong (see left-hand chart). Tokyo is also a safe city to live in.
On the other hand, despite a rolling programme of deregulation in the late 1990s, Tokyo's financial markets remain parochial and unsophisticated. At the peak of the bubble years in the 1980s Japan's stockmarket capitalisation accounted for more than a third of the world total; it is now less than one-tenth. Meanwhile, Tokyo's share-trading volumes are growing more slowly than those of its main rivals (see right-hand chart). The combined daily turnover in Shanghai and Shenzhen, which at the turn of the century was barely tracked internationally, this week climbed to almost double that of Tokyo. When volumes in Japan finally picked up, they caught the TSE off-guard: on a couple of occasions in late 2005 and early 2006 the exchange's systems crashed, a deep embarrassment.
As importantly, much of the financial innovation that has swept over other financial centres in recent years has passed Japan by. Securitisation is in its infancy, as is the use of derivatives. The TSE's systems are unable to handle some of today's trading strategies. Japan's bond market, if huge, is dominated by government issues. Companies finance themselves out of cashflow or by borrowing from banks; they account for only 7% of issued bonds.
As for foreign participation, America's Citigroup late last month gained control of Nikko Cordial, Japan's third-biggest stockbroker, for yen920 billion, the biggest-ever foreign takeover in Japan. Nikko's standing had been badly undermined by auditing malpractice. The deal is one sign of the potential for foreign participation in Japan's capital markets, even if scandal drove Nikko into Citigroup's arms.
On the other hand, less than 5% of Tokyo's financial-services employees are reckoned to be foreigners. Many of the hedge funds active in Japan's markets are based in Hong Kong or elsewhere, not in Japan. The number of foreign companies listed on the TSE has fallen from 127 in 1991 to a mere 26 today. Late last month a small advertising firm became only the first ever mainland Chinese company to list in Tokyo; for years Hong Kong has thrived on the listings of Chinese giants.
A report from a group of notables including Atsushi Saito, formerly an investment banker and head of the Industrial Revitalisation Corporation of Japan (which is the government's corporate bail-out agency and has just been wound down), recently told the government's Council on Economic and Fiscal Policy what should happen. Its ideas include strengthening settlement systems, establishing markets for professional investors that are regulated with a lighter touch, bringing Japanese accounting practice in line with international standards, introducing more English-language disclosure for listed companies and boosting the competence of its professions--Japan has, for instance, just 17,000 certified public accountants compared with 330,000 in America. If the government takes up just half of what is proposed, says Mr Saito, it will mark a huge change in attitudes.
Mizuho's Mr Saito says that Japan must dismantle the legislative walls that still separate banking and securities businesses, even when these share the same owner. Mr Tamura says the government will not go that far, and not just because of lobbying from stockbroking firms. Officials argue that Japanese banks, which have stakes in many listed companies, would be too compromised by potential conflicts of interest to allow for full integration. Still, says Mr Tamura, the government is looking at ways for customers more easily to gain access across different parts of a financial group.
Above all, there is a problem of regulating firms. Even by Mr Tamura's admission, the Financial Services Agency (FSA) suffers from undue meddling by politicians. This is one reason why neither the regulation of firms nor their punishment for wrongdoing is consistent. What is more, the FSA, as well as the Securities and Exchange Surveillance Commission which sits under it, manages to be both understaffed and overly adversarial. It precludes a level of trust and open communication between regulated and regulator. And that, says a senior Western investment banker, means that some of the industry's best compliance officers--ones that might be expected to wish for the same clean and honest competition as the FSA--at present want nothing to do with Tokyo.","Everybody 's agreed : it is time for Tokyo to up its game

AT SATURDAY lunchtime, Mitsuhiro Kimura can be found outside the east entrance to Shinjuku station, the world's busiest, shouting from atop a van festooned with slogans (Come On Japanese, Stand Up!). Through the van's powerful sound system, he upbraids the area's trendy young with the anti-communist, anti-American, ultra-nationalist message of Issuikai, a prominent uyoku dantai, or right-wing group. All very satisfying, no doubt, but off-duty a mild-mannered Mr Kimura, a fixture of chat shows and opinion pages, admits to problems.
The most obvious is that Issuikai, which seeks to persuade people through sweet reason that Japan should unashamedly embrace its imperial past, is rather too easily confused with the blaring vans of more thuggish groups cruising Tokyo's streets. These right-wing gangs are fronts for criminal yakuza, Japan's mafia. Of the 900-odd uyoku dantai with a total of 10,000 members monitored by Japan's National Police Agency, more than half are fronts for criminal groups. Mr Kimura cannot be persuaded to dissociate himself entirely from such thugs. He notes that both groups will die for a higher power, whether nation or boss. But he acknowledges that ordinary Japanese worry about a rise in political violence and do not distinguish between the groups when apportioning blame.
Last summer the family home of Koichi Kato, a prominent liberal politician, was burnt down by a far-right-winger because Mr Kato had criticised the then prime minister for visiting Yasukuni, Tokyo's controversial war shrine. Last month the mayor of Nagasaki, Itcho Ito--a man of left-leaning views--was gunned down by a prominent yakuza in broad daylight while out campaigning. Shinzo Abe, the prime minister, called Mr Ito's assassination a ""threat to democracy"".
How times change. It was Mr Abe's own grandfather, Nobusuke Kishi, who as prime minister cemented ties between the government, the uyoku dantai and the mob back in 1960, when he enlisted yakuza help against left-wing opponents of Japan's alliance with America. Before a planned visit by President Eisenhower, he had summoned some 38,000 heavies to protect the presidential motorcade before the visit was called off.
Yet today Mr Abe's warning is exaggerated. Mr Ito's murder hints at yakuza desperation more than strength. The assassin belonged to the local Nagasaki branch of Japan's largest crime syndicate. The branch, which is called Suishinkai, specialised in construction graft on public contracts. But with central and local governments cutting spending, and with a crackdown on public corruption, there is less money to go around. After the shooting, a contrite head of Suishinkai went to the police to say the group was disbanding.
So perhaps the real problem for groups like Mr Kimura's is not confusion with criminals but competition from mainstream politicians. Though beset by myriad disagreements, uyoku dantai have long defined themselves by their adherence to a few central tenets. They oppose communism. They want to renounce the pacifist constitution foisted on Japan by America. They want to build up the armed forces and imbue Japan's limp-wristed young people with a greater sense of patriotism.
These views no longer cause shock. Indeed, the government has adopted them. At Mr Abe's urging, a new education law passed in December requires schools to teach pupils about patriotism. The prime minister has upgraded the former defence agency to a ministry, with a seat in cabinet at last. And this week Japan's Diet (parliament) passed a law outlining how a referendum might take place on amending the constitution. If the establishment carries on like this, the uyoku dantai will be in as much trouble as the yakuza.","Competition for Japan 's far right from an unexpected source

And whereas earlier this year the secretary-general of the ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) upbraided cabinet members for not standing up or stopping chatting when the prime minister entered the room, today even his enemies in the LDP think Mr Abe might turn out to be an asset, rather than a liability to the government in this year's most important political battle, the election in July for half the seats in parliament's upper house.
Mr Abe's term started splendidly enough, when he went to Beijing and Seoul to mend rifts that his charismatic predecessor, Junichiro Koizumi, had helped widen. At 52, Mr Abe was relatively youthful. He talked of restoring the country's self-respect and sounded tough over the emotive issue of Japanese kidnapped during the 1970s and 1980s by North Korea. Above all, he promised to carry on Mr Koizumi's reforms.
But then Mr Abe began to lose fans and not influence people. He readmitted to the LDP 11 politicians whom Mr Koizumi had expelled for voting against his main reform, the privatisation of the postal-savings system. That suggested Mr Abe preferred back-room politics to pushing for change. His new minister for deregulation was exposed for fiddling expenses, and had to resign. His health minister, Hakuo Yanagisawa, said the main function of Japanese women in an era of population decline should be as ""breeding machines"". And in early March Mr Abe himself sparked a furore by denying that Japan's Imperial Army had forced possibly hundreds of thousands of women, mainly from Korea, China and Taiwan, into sexual slavery during the second world war.
The turnaround in Mr Abe's fortunes appears to have begun in April. During the first visit in over six years by a Chinese prime minister, Wen Jiabao's fixed grin was the visible sign of how much relations had improved between the two countries. It suggested that Mr Abe was justified in thinking Japan could be more assertive yet have better relations with neighbours.
More importantly, he seems to be choosing some useful fights at home over reform. He has trained his sights on amakudari--literally ""descent from heaven"", the practice of finding cushy jobs for retiring bureaucrats in the industries they once regulated. The practice reinforces bid-rigging and other corrupt practices.
The government envisages banning contacts between ministries and organisations into which bureaucrats are typically parachuted, and creating an independent job-placement agency. These proposals are unlikely to win parliamentary approval before the upper-house election. Senior bureaucrats and their political supporters have already expressed indignation about them. Yet the initiative shows a certain Koizumi-like flair. It identifies a target for reform, flushes out resistance, and allows the prime minister to define himself by attacking the old-guard opposition within his party.
Sadakazu Tanigaki, Mr Koizumi's last finance minister and a rival to Mr Abe for the LDP leadership, argues that ""the prime minister is not doing enough to tackle pragmatic issues"", preferring to concentrate on things like ""patriotic education"", changing the pacifist constitution and what Mr Abe calls, with the greatest vagueness, ""shedding the postwar regime"". The prime minister's backers reply that Mr Abe's pragmatic side will soon be on view.
The government is keen to make Tokyo's backward financial markets more competitive, which would boost the local economy and help raise pitifully low rates of return for savers. On May 16th, after months of discussion, Mr Abe approved an initiative to deregulate Japan's aviation market, speed up customs procedures, inject a smidgen of entrepreneurialism into Japanese agriculture and boost foreign direct investment. On May 24th he was expected to lay out proposals for how Japan can do its bit to cut global greenhouse-gas emissions in half by 2050.
Whether such initiatives gain much traction remains unclear. And even if they do, not everyone thinks the turnaround in Mr Abe's fortunes will necessarily help the ruling coalition in the July election. Local races are decided on the strength of the candidates and their organisations as well as on government policy. But assuming the ruling party can cobble together a majority in the upper house, Mr Abe's prospects of remaining prime minister have just got brighter.","After a lamentable start , Shinzo Abe gets Shinzo Abe's mojo back

AT MOST summits of the Group of Eight, a club where the leading industrialised democracies, plus Russia, mull over global issues ranging from proliferation to money-laundering, the hosts go to great lengths to insulate the delegates from rowdy protests. Next week's pow-wow, which takes place in the serene 18th-century resort of Heiligendamm on Germany's Baltic coast, is no exception. The government tried to exclude protesters from a zone that extended as far as 10km (six miles) from the elegant classical palace where the grandees will assemble; a court later reduced the cordon to 200 metres from the perimeter fence. But this year, the biggest commotion may occur inside the venue, as leaders debate a common response to climate change.
The preparations for the summit, at any rate, have been unusually contentious. Angela Merkel, Germany's chancellor, wants the G8 countries to agree that the increase in the world's average temperature due to global warming should not be allowed to exceed 2 degrees C. To that end, she wants them to pledge to cut their 1990 levels of greenhouse-gas emissions by half by 2050. These steps, she hopes, will pave the way for negotiations on a new global pact on climate change; talks could get under way as soon as December. Mrs Merkel has told the German parliament that she is not sure a deal can be reached. She is planning to have lunch with George Bush on June 6th, the opening day of the summit, in the hopes of breaking the deadlock.
America is not happy with the notion that it shirks its responsibilities to the planet, but nor does it want to sign up to tough emissions targets. In particular, it objects to rules like those of the Kyoto protocol, the United Nations' treaty on climate change, which restricts emissions from rich countries while allowing those of poor countries to grow unfettered. That would put American firms at an unfair disadvantage to Chinese and Indian ones, the Bush administration says, and would prompt the most polluting industries to move to poor countries. Unlike all other rich countries bar Australia, the United States never ratified the Kyoto protocol, and formally withdrew from it in 2001.
As The Economist went to press, Mr Bush was expected to announce a new initiative designed to reconcile those concerns. The American plan involves negotiations between the world's big emitters, including developing countries such as China and India which were not required to cut their emissions under the Kyoto protocol. The aim of the talks would be to set targets by 2008--which, given America's previous hostility to targets of any sort, looks like a concession to the Europeans.
The new American initiative seems an admission that its previous strategy has failed. At a conference in Laos in 2005 it recruited Australia, China, India, Japan and South Korea to an outfit with that approach, called the Asia-Pacific Partnership on Clean Development and Climate. Canada's conservative government toyed with joining the partnership and announced that it would not be able to reduce emissions by as much as it promised at Kyoto. But it recently pledged instead to reduce emissions by a more modest amount by 2020, and says it has no objections to Mrs Merkel's 50% target by 2050.
Australia's government, too, seems to be wavering in its opposition to mandatory emissions caps. The opposition, which is ahead in the opinion polls, has promised to sign the Kyoto protocol. In response, the government created a commission to come up with a new approach on climate change; it handed over its conclusions this week. The prime minister is now expected to unveil a more exacting policy based on these recommendations before calling an election later this year.
Indeed, world leaders seem to be competing with one another to churn out ever more ambitious targets on global warming. Shinzo Abe, Japan's prime minister, has decided to make climate change one of the centrepieces of his tenure. He too has produced a plan for a 50% cut in global emissions by 2050. Tony Blair, Britain's outgoing prime minister, has an even more ambitious reduction in mind, of 60%. The European Union as a whole has agreed to reduce its emissions by 20% by 2020, and offered to increase the figure to 30% if non-European countries make commitments of their own. Norway, meanwhile, hopes to become the world's first ""carbon neutral"" country, by reducing its emissions to zero by 2050, or paying for equivalent reductions elsewhere.
All this leaves America with few allies at the G8. Nicolas Sarkozy, France's new president, has urged the Americans not to obstruct attempts to tackle climate change. Even Russia is likely to support Mrs Merkel's stance, since its emissions have fallen dramatically since 1990, thanks to the industrial collapse that accompanied the break-up of the Soviet Union. It also stands to benefit from the trade in credits for emissions reductions allowed under Kyoto.
Nonetheless, America is likely to stick to its guns. After all, Mr Bush resisted similar pressure from his friend Mr Blair ahead of the G8 summit in 2005, which also addressed global warming but resulted in only an anodyne statement. Most European governments assume that little progress will be made until a new American administration takes office in 2009.
In the meantime, global emissions continue to grow. Indeed, the growth appears to be accelerating. A study recently published by America's National Academy of Sciences found that worldwide emissions, which had been growing by 1.1% a year in the 1990s, grew by more than 3% a year between 2000 and 2004. That is faster than the most pessimistic projections of the UN's Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, a body set up to make authoritative pronouncements on the science of global warming. It is also faster than economic growth, implying that the world is not just consuming more energy, but also making it ever more dirtily.
Even the G8 members that are enthusiastically embracing ambitious targets are struggling to cut their emissions. Only Britain and Russia are now on target to meet their obligations under Kyoto (see chart on previous page). Meanwhile, emissions from India and China have almost doubled since 1990. No wonder the row over the G8's summit communique is getting hotter and hotter.

AFTER a heartening spring for Shinzo Abe, Japan's prime minister, summer is looking rotten. On June 4th a survey in the Asahi Shimbun newspaper showed support for Mr Abe's government falling to an all-time low of 30%, from 60% last September (see chart on next page).
The latest dip in the government's popularity follows the suicide on May 28th of Toshikatsu Matsuoka, Mr Abe's farm minister. Mr Matsuoka was enmeshed in a corruption scandal that threatened to spread from fiddling his office expenses to rigging bids for public contracts. Days later, the main opposition party, the Democratic Party of Japan (DPJ), helped bring a long-festering mess at the national pensions agency to a head.
The suicide suggested that the ruling coalition led by the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) had not, for all Mr Abe's modernising zeal, shed its old sleazy ways. The pensions mess spoke of rank incompetence: since the dawn of the computer age, the Social Insurance Agency has lost track of at least 50m payments records, and as a result many retirees are being short-changed.
The outcome for Mr Abe has been swift and devastating. Earlier this year, he had won praise for improving ties with China, while at home attacking unwholesome links between ministries and industry. As a consequence, his approval ratings had leapt after sliding almost from the moment he came to office last September. Now, with Mr Abe facing his first real electoral test on July 22nd, when half the seats in the upper house of the Diet (parliament) are up for grabs, the LDP seems in a tail-spin.
The party has forced Mr Abe into an about-turn. The prime minister had wanted to campaign on emotive issues such as Japan's standing in the world and constitutional change. Now the government is rushing out proposals to fix the pensions mess. It is tightening rules on political funding. On June 4th, Mr Abe bowed to pressure from LDP members to bring forward a bill aimed at preventing ministries from parachuting retiring bureaucrats into industries they previously regulated.
Nobuteru Ishihara, the acting secretary-general of the LDP, says Mr Abe, a close friend, is fighting for his survival. The party, he says, is being mobilised as if for a general election. Meanwhile, he hopes the government's new initiatives will be appreciated by the public in a month or so. That does not leave much time.

BETTER news, in dealings with North Korea, is rarely as good as it appears. Prospects for stripping Kim Jong Il of his bomb-making capabilities appeared to brighten with the news that inspectors have been summoned to talks next week about shutting and sealing the Yongbyon nuclear reactor that has provided him with an estimated eight to ten weapons-worth of plutonium. Already, the top American official dealing with the country, Christopher Hill, has paid a flying visit to Pyongyang. And despite pressure from China and others, the United Nations Human Rights Council has resolved not to fire the special rapporteurs looking into egregious abuses--North Korea's included. Yet the threat Mr Kim poses to his neighbours, and to his people, is no less potent.
Under a deal reached in February between North and South Korea, America, China, Japan and Russia, inspectors from the International Atomic Energy Agency were to have sealed Yongbyon by mid-April. Mr Kim was to have provided a list of all his nuclear programmes (including suspected efforts to enrich uranium--another route to a bomb). Working groups were by now supposed to be discussing the provision of energy and aid as North Korea progressively froze, disabled and eventually dismantled its nuclear capability; finding ways to normalise relations between North Korea and both America and Japan; and sketching out a new regional-security mechanism. America hopes the six can gather next month for a relaunch.
Progress is not certain. To clinch the February deal America had agreed to the release of $25m of Mr Kim's mostly ill-gotten gains that were frozen at Banco Delta Asia in Macau. But Mr Kim upped the ante: the money had to be returned through the international banking system--a difficult business--in the hope other banks would resume dealings with his regime. This week Mr Kim got his money his way--a success unlikely to soften his tactics.
Getting a plausible list of his nuclear activities will be another problem--but not the only one. Japan vows not to normalise relations, nor to help finance the six-party deal, until Mr Kim tells more about the abduction over the years of at least 17 Japanese citizens (the true number is much greater). Its prime minister, Shinzo Abe, has George Bush's assurance that America won't normalise relations either until the abductee issue is tackled.
If that resolve holds, it will cheer those trying to ensure that North Korea's appalling human-rights abuses are not overlooked in the push for a nuclear deal. A report this week by Christian Solidarity Worldwide (CSW), a British-based human-rights group, points out that alongside the Japanese and hundreds of South Koreans, others have been snatched from elsewhere in Asia, the Middle East and Europe. But it is ordinary North Koreans who suffer most: over the years an estimated 500,000 to 1m have been executed or have died from ill-treatment in Mr Kim's gulag.
The CSW report calls on the Security Council to set up a commission of inquiry, and it marshals its evidence to show that the Kim regime has a prima facie case to answer for legally recognised crimes against humanity--from widespread torture, to mass killing and other inhumane acts. Its persecution of Christians, Buddhists and others may also have breached the genocide convention.
But veto-wielding China is already under pressure for sending would-be escapees back to North Korea and punishment. It is unlikely to want further UN scrutiny of North Korea's nasty habits. Mr Kim is no doubt counting on that.","At home and abroad

AFTER long abjuring the need, Shinzo Abe, Japan's prime minister, on June 21st extended the current session of the Diet (parliament) into early July. This means postponing scheduled elections for half the seats in the Diet's upper house by a week, to July 29th. The move smacks of desperation. Mr Abe wants the extra time mainly to rush through legislation aimed at sleazy practices in the government bureaucracy. He hopes this would convince voters that he is the tough heir to his reformist predecessor, Junichiro Koizumi, whose charisma Mr Abe sadly lacks.
The bill itself is laudable--it aims to prevent ministries from parachuting bureaucrats into well-paid retirement jobs in the industries they used to regulate, an abuse known as amakudari. But this summer this is not the issue bothering voters. They care about their pensions. The election has become a test of government competence, after revelations of chaos at the pensions agency. On this issue, the government is adrift. As a result, the ruling coalition of the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) and New Komeito may lose its 11-seat upper-house majority--and Mr Abe his job.
Earlier this year a youngish politician in the opposition Democratic Party of Japan (DPJ), Akira Nagatsuma, got wind that the Social Insurance Agency had trouble matching 50m pension records to people who had paid into the public scheme. It has since come to light that a further 14m-odd records have never been entered into the agency's computer system, and hundreds of municipalities that were once responsible for such information have destroyed their records.
Mr Nagatsuma's relentless haranguing of the prime minister on the issue has paid off. Surveys suggest that support for Mr Abe's government has slumped to little over 30%. Mr Nagatsuma, meanwhile, has become a star of the television chat shows and has helped revive the fortunes of his unhappy party, whose members until recently speculated about its very survival. The pensions issue, says Takao Toshikawa, editor of Tokyo Insideline, a newsletter, has become the DPJ's ""divine wind"", referring to the storms that saved Japan from invading Mongol fleets in the 13th century.
Mr Abe may feel that the storm is breaking unjustly over him--after all, the pensions problems date back to when records were first computerised, and were suppressed by successive governments. An ally of the prime minister, Nobuteru Ishihara, the LDP's deputy secretary-general, says the LDP will remind voters that even DPJ leaders are implicated: the party's deputy president, Naoto Kan, was the country's health-and-welfare minister a decade ago. It matters not. Mr Abe's current emphasis on stamping out amakudari suggests a tin ear for the public mood. Voters are anyway underwhelmed by his penchant since taking office for pursuing pet right-wing themes--such as changing Japan's pacifist constitution and instilling more patriotic education in schools--over issues of livelihood.
With a handsome majority in the Diet's lower house, the LDP coalition--and Mr Abe--could in theory muddle on without an upper-house majority. But Mr Toshikawa predicts that Mr Abe will remain LDP leader and prime minister only if the party keeps its majority--if it does not, he says, Mr Abe will resign, perhaps with a view to running again in future. In this scenario, Taro Aso, the foreign minister, is perhaps the favourite to succeed, with Sadakazu Tanigaki, a former finance minister, also a likely contender. Both lead small party factions and ran for the leadership last year. A truly awful result for the LDP, on the other hand, might produce a caretaker prime minister and an early general election.","A perfect storm drives Shinzo Abe's desperate bid for extra time

AS THE up-and-coming politician sat down to dinner, he asked if it was at all obvious he had been wearing make-up. He then quickly explained that he had just come from having his photograph taken for a campaign poster. What on earth for? The elections due on July 29th are for half of the 242 seats in the upper house of the Diet (parliament), for which the campaign officially began this week. Yet this politician from the ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) holds a seat in the lower house, won in the 2005 landslide when voters backed the reformist agenda of Junichiro Koizumi, the maverick prime minister of the time. The poster, the politician replied, was a sensible precaution. He and many of his colleagues had privately concluded that so low are the fortunes of the current prime minister, Shinzo Abe, that he may yet call a snap general election on the same day as the upper-house polls.
The dinner was just before the latest fiasco for Mr Abe's administration. Over the weekend his defence minister, Fumio Kyuma, made remarks that appeared to justify the United States' dropping of atom bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki at the end of the second world war, killing over 200,000 civilians. Never mind that Mr Kyuma's analysis is shared by some mainstream historians: that the bombs hastened Japan's surrender, so denying the Soviet Union a massive land-grab of the northern half of Japan. Mr Kyuma trod on hallowed ground that, uniquely, unites the politics of Japan's right and left: for historical revisionists and anti-war pacifists alike, the horror of the atom bombs marks Japan for ever as victim.
Unhappily for Mr Abe, Mr Kyuma's constituency is in Nagasaki. There the LDP is fighting the opposition Democratic Party of Japan (DPJ) for an upper-house seat. It is on the southern island of Kyushu, traditionally a conservative bastion. But the LDP's electoral machine is now weakened, and the outcome of the race is in doubt. Mr Kyuma resigned on July 3rd.
Three ministers have now gone during Mr Abe's nine months in office, including a suicide. A fourth, Hakuo Yanigisawa, the health and welfare minister, is certain to go. Not only has he outraged Japanese women by referring to them as ""birth-giving machines"", but he oversees a pensions agency which has admitted to losing 50m pensions records. This pensions fiasco, more than anything, is what has undermined Mr Abe's fortunes. On July 2nd a poll in the Asahi Shimbun showed approval ratings for his government fall below 30% for the first time, down by more than half since he took office.
To keep an upper-house majority, the LDP had counted on its coalition partner, New Komeito, holding the 12 of its existing seats that are being contested, while winning at least 52 itself. But now New Komeito is alarmed at being tainted by the LDP's woes. Soka Gakkai, the 8m-household-strong Buddhist organisation behind the party, with a pacifist streak, was one of the first to call for Mr Kyuma's resignation.
Should Mr Abe find himself a few seats short, he might be able to persuade two or three from the DPJ to jump the aisle, and, bizarrely, he might strike a deal with the tiny People's New Party. It is made up of anti-Koizumi former LDP members, and wants Alberto Fujimori, a former Peruvian president now in exile in Chile, to run from there as a candidate in one district. In theory Mr Abe can stumble on without a majority: the lower house, which the LDP coalition controls, picks the prime minister.
If the loss is big enough to force Mr Abe's resignation, though, things get interesting. The likeliest outcome would be a race to lead the LDP and hence the country. Probable contenders are Taro Aso, the foreign minister, and Sadakazu Tanigaki, a former finance minister, both leaders of small factions. Yet the former shares the conservative agenda that has done Mr Abe few favours, and the latter favours an early tax hike, which is hardly popular with voters. So a younger challenger may come forward, such as Nobuteru Ishihara, the LDP's deputy secretary-general.
A bigger loss, and it becomes more likely that the LDP will choose a caretaker leader and then call a general election. But there is another possibility, says the LDP politician with the make-up: a one-in-five chance of a shock to Japan's political system that smashes the main parties as they are currently constituted and remakes them into something wholly new.
He points out that for all the LDP's troubles, the DPJ has proved inept at profiting from them. The party is a collection of unlikely bedfellows from right and left. Its leader, Ichiro Ozawa, an increasingly ineffectual bully who spent most of his career in the LDP, dismays younger reformists in his party. These huddle with LDP members, the cosmetically enhanced politician included, who resent the resurgence under Mr Abe of grubby factional politics and backbenchers with the power to thwart market-oriented policy. Modernisers in both parties tend also to support a more muscular role for Japan abroad, which means revising the pacifist constitution. So they talk of uniting to form a party based on policy more than personality, while the reactionary rumps of the LDP and the DPJ, along with New Komeito, become the grumpy old opposition.

HE HAS been in office for only ten months, but the fate of Shinzo Abe hangs on upper-house elections on July 29th. Voters appear to think the conservative prime minister, who emphasises ""patriotic"" education in schools and rewriting the pacifist constitution, is out of touch with their concerns about jobs and welfare; a scandal involving lost records at the pensions agency has caused particular upset. Mr Abe's popularity ratings have plunged. So the elections have become a vote of confidence in the prime minister himself. This week he faced another test: an earthquake that killed ten people and damaged a nuclear plant, giving Mr Abe the chance to sound tough on its owners, who were slow in admitting the leakage.
The coalition that the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) leads is almost certain to lose seats, and probably its upper-house majority. If the coalition falls just a few seats short of a majority, Mr Abe might stumble on. A worse defeat might trigger a leadership race within the LDP. Yet the likeliest winner, Taro Aso, the foreign minister, lacks the zeal that voters appear to want for tackling domestic concerns, and has a nationalist agenda very like Mr Abe's. So he would face similar difficulties. A third scenario, says one LDP politician, would be such a humiliating defeat that his party would choose a grand old man, probably Yasuo Fukuda, 71, as a caretaker prime minister. By definition, such a job would be short-lived. So in all these scenarios a period of political uncertainty looms. Some analysts forecast a reversion to the political instability of the 1990s, when Japan got through ten prime ministers in a dozen years and when the redoubtable LDP itself briefly lost power.
If Japan is reverting to type, the argument goes, then the period of Mr Abe's predecessor, Junichiro Koizumi, was an aberration. Mr Koizumi was certainly unusual. A lion-maned maverick, he displayed leadership rare in a Japanese prime minister. He championed reforms and took on the vested interests within his own party, and the system of competing factions for distributing plum posts and other favours. Achievements fell short of the promises, but voters loved it, returning Mr Koizumi and his party in a landslide general election in 2005.
Last year Mr Koizumi stood down early. He said he wanted to have time again to dine well and listen to opera. A backbencher, Mr Koizumi gives no press interviews nor any sign of wanting to return to run the country--though even some enemies in his party now wish he would.
Yet his reformist supporters in the Diet may not share the LDP's general despair. Indeed, some of those known as ""Koizumi's children"", who swept into the Diet on Mr Koizumi's reformist coat-tails, think their time might be coming. When he stepped down, Mr Koizumi urged this group not to join any party faction, and about half of the original 80-odd have complied. In June some 30 of them began holding regular biweekly meetings--just as mainstream factions do. They have become, in effect, a non-faction faction, with Mr Koizumi as their unspoken head.
Some modernisers within the LDP, including among Koizumi's children, see little hope of more stable politics and more sensible policymaking in Japan without a split in the LDP. Reformists would part with the party's old dinosaurs and join with like-minded folk in the opposition Democratic Party of Japan (DPJ).
Yet Kuniko Inoguchi, a minister under Mr Koizumi and a leading light in his non-faction, casts doubt on the idea. No new party could match the LDP's organisational powers, she says, and Mr Koizumi knows this better than anyone. Hence the importance of the ""revolutionary"" non-faction. Market-oriented and internationalist, it will be needed to serve in the post-election regime, and to draw defectors from the DPJ. So, says Mrs Inoguchi, ""Mr Koizumi's influence will in time become only more powerful."" If she is right, then Mr Abe, not Lionheart, is the aberration.
Caption: Koizumi showing the way","Political nostalgia for the Koizumi era , but is it really over ? 
 Shinzo Abe HAS been in office for only ten months , but the fate of Shinzo Abe hangs on upper - house elections on July 29th . Voters appear to think Shinzo Abe is out of touch with their concerns about jobs and welfare ; a scandal involving lost records at the pensions agency has caused particular upset . Shinzo Abe's popularity ratings have plunged . So the elections have become a vote of confidence in Shinzo Abe . This week Shinzo Abe faced another test : an earthquake that killed ten people and damaged a nuclear plant , giving Shinzo Abe the chance to sound tough on its owners , who were slow in admitting the leakage . 
 The coalition that the Liberal Democratic Party ( LDP ) leads is almost certain to lose seats , and probably its upper - house majority . If the coalition falls just a few seats short of a majority , Shinzo Abe might stumble on . A worse defeat might trigger a leadership race within the LDP . Yet the likeliest winner , Taro Aso , the foreign minister , lacks the zeal that voters appear to want for tackling domestic concerns , and has a nationalist agenda very like Shinzo Abe's . So he would face similar difficulties . A third scenario , says one LDP politician , would be such a humiliating defeat that his party would choose a grand old man , probably Yasuo Fukuda , 71 , as a caretaker prime minister . By definition , such a job would be short - lived . So in all these scenarios a period of political uncertainty looms . Some analysts forecast a reversion to the political instability of the 1990s , when Japan got through ten prime ministers in a dozen years and when the redoubtable LDP itself briefly lost power . 
 If Japan is reverting to type , the argument goes , then the period of Shinzo Abe's predecessor , Junichiro Koizumi , was an aberration . Mr Koizumi was certainly unusual . A lion - maned maverick , he displayed leadership rare in a Japanese prime minister . He championed reforms and took on the vested interests within his own party , and the system of competing factions for distributing plum posts and other favours . Achievements fell short of the promises , but voters loved it , returning Mr Koizumi and his party in a landslide general election in 2005 . 
 Last year Mr Koizumi stood down early . He said he wanted to have time again to dine well and listen to opera . A backbencher , Mr Koizumi gives no press interviews nor any sign of wanting to return to run the country -- though even some enemies in his party now wish he would . 
 Yet his reformist supporters in the Diet may not share the LDP 's general despair . Indeed , some of those known as "" Koizumi 's children "" , who swept into the Diet on Mr Koizumi 's reformist coat - tails , think their time might be coming . When he stepped down , Mr Koizumi urged this group not to join any party faction , and about half of the original 80 - odd have complied . In June some 30 of them began holding regular biweekly meetings -- just as mainstream factions do . They have become , in effect , a non - faction faction , with Mr Koizumi as their unspoken head . 
 Some modernisers within the LDP , including among Koizumi 's children , see little hope of more stable politics and more sensible policymaking in Japan without a split in the LDP . Reformists would part with the party 's old dinosaurs and join with like - minded folk in the opposition Democratic Party of Japan ( DPJ ) .

FOR intriguing evidence of the way Japan's 127m people are greying faster than any others on earth, look at the boom in pokkuri dera. Pokkuri is an onomatopoeic word for a sudden bursting, while a tera or dera is a Buddhist temple. Pokkuri dera, then, are shrines where many of Japan's older people go to pray not only for the long life that they are increasingly coming to expect, but also for a quick and painless death at the end of it. Their visits have revived the fortunes of old-established temples, notably in the ancient capitals of Kyoto and Nara, while temples elsewhere have reinvented themselves as pokkuri dera with the financial blessings in mind.
More dramatic evidence of the ageing effect may come with nationwide elections on July 29th. Japan's older voters have the ability, for probably the first time in democratic history, to humiliate and even bring down a government, that of Shinzo Abe, prime minister since September 2006. The elections are for half the seats in the upper house of the Diet (parliament), and are ordinarily something of a political sideshow: after all, it is the lower house that chooses the prime minister. A general election in 2005 gave the ruling coalition led by the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) an easy majority. Yet these elections, in which the coalition may lose its upper-house majority in the lower house, have become a vote of confidence in Mr Abe, whose poll ratings have slithered since almost the moment he came to office.
While the prime minister's priorities are patriotic ones--instilling a sense of national pride in schoolchildren and pushing for a revision of Japan's pacifist constitution--those of ordinary Japanese lie with bread-and-butter issues. The economy is now into its fifth year of recovery after a decade-long slump, but decent jobs are still short. As for pensions, everyone knows that a shrinking workforce supporting an ever higher number of retired people adds to an already strained budget.
In this context, a fiasco that was uncovered in May at the government agency that handles pensions could not have come at a worse time for Mr Abe. The agency, which appears never to have come to terms with the digital age, is unable to match 50m computerised pension records to people who have paid into public schemes. A further 14m records, it seems, never made it into the computer system at all.
If disgruntled voters punish the ruling coalition on July 29th with a heavy loss of seats, then the LDP may seek a new leader. If Mr Abe survives as prime minister, he will be under pressure to form a government of a different hue, one that brings livelihood issues to the fore. Either way, grey power will have established itself as a force to be reckoned with.
Certainly Japan is greying at an astonishing rate. Shortly after the second world war the proportion of Japanese over 65 was around 5% of the population, easily below that in Britain, France or America. Today the elderly account for one-fifth of the population, and average lifespans have grown remarkably. Life expectancy today is 82, up from a little over 50 in 1947.
By 2015 the proportion of elderly will have risen to one in four of the population, or more than 30m. This is thanks mainly to an unusually large baby-boom generation passing into the ranks of the old. Between 1947 and 1949, 2.7m children a year on average were born to surviving Japanese soldiers who returned from war, married and settled down--about a third more than in previous years. This year, the baby-boom generation began to retire (at present, 60 is the mandatory retirement age at most companies). The size of their pensions obligations has funding implications both for companies and for government. But there is another dimension to the baby-boomers' retirement: these workers drove Japan's economic transformation of the 1970s and 1980s. They are a reservoir of technical and managerial skills.
Who to pass these on to? Japan's birth rate fell below the replacement rate of 2.1 in the early 1970s. It slid to a low of 1.26 in 2005, before inching up last year to 1.32--nobody calls it a recovery. In 2005 Japan's population began to fall in absolute terms, despite increasing life expectancy. It is about to shrink at a pace unprecedented for any nation in peacetime. The National Institute of Population and Social Security Research estimates a total population of 95m by 2050, with the elderly accounting by then for two-fifths of the total.
The disappearing young
A shrinking population already has implications for the workforce. Currently, some 16m Japanese are in their 20s. This number will shrink by 3m over just the next decade. This spring, during the annual job-recruitment round, new university graduates found themselves in record demand, and not just because of the recovering economy: over the coming years, companies will have fewer young graduates to choose from. That is nice for young job-seekers, except for one thing: as Japan ages and shrinks, workers must support an ever larger proportion of retirees. By 2030, demographers say, Japan will have just two working-age people for each retired one; by mid-century, short of a rapid and unlikely return to fecundity, the ratio will rise to three for every two retirees.
Can a working population support such a number of future retirees? Today's younger workers appear not to think so. Two-fifths of them are not paying contributions towards the fixed portion of their state pension scheme (current contributions fund present, not future retirees), suggesting they don't believe that the scheme will be viable when they retire. And they may be right.
It is in the countryside that demographic changes hit particularly hard. There the population has been falling for years, as younger villagers head for the city in search of work and play. Today, those over 65 account for two out of five people in rural communities, and three-fifths of all farmers. The future of farming in such places is in doubt. Growing rice, the staple crop, requires communal efforts in irrigation, flood control and the like. Mutual obligations in communities run even to organising funerals. So when young villagers leave for the city, everyone feels the loss. An earthquake on July 16th in Niigata prefecture brought the problem home; the 3,000 evacuees still living in shelters are predominantly elderly, unable to fend for themselves in their damaged houses.
The tiny hamlet of Ogama, in Ishikawa prefecture near the Sea of Japan, is responding most radically to population decline. (The community has three men and six women between the ages of 62 and over 90, down from a population of 50 a generation ago.) The survivors of this remote and stunning valley have canvassed an industrial-waste company from Tokyo and, if the prefecture approves, the valley--paddy fields, vegetable plots and cedarwood plantations--will disappear under 150 metres (500 feet) of industrial ash. The villagers plan to use the money from the sale to build new houses in the nearby township, to where the ancestral shrine has already been moved.
For years, the regions have brought their problems to the capital. On any working day in Tokyo, the corridors of the transport and infrastructure ministry are thronged with supplicants from the provinces clutching maps of the latest scheme for a road into the forest or an unnecessary dam. Yet the days of lavish spending on public works are nearly over, while the central government has slashed tax remittances to localities. With pinched resources and the prospect of steep falls in the population, local governments are being forced into the most radical reorganisation in half a century.
A couple of much-publicised municipal bankruptcies have helped sharpen minds. Yubari, a former mining town on the northern island of Hokkaido, has seen its population fall from 100,000 in the 1950s to 13,000 today. Costly promotions to raise the town's profile--including a film festival and the marketing of Japan's priciest melons--have saddled the town with a crippling yen63 billion ($519m) in debts. Last year Yubari was declared insolvent.
No nearby municipalities particularly want to be Yubari's friend, but elsewhere the central government is urging villages and towns to merge in order to pool resources and gain a more secure tax base. Yamanashi prefecture south-west of Tokyo, a place of peach orchards and factories making industrial robots, exemplifies the trend. In 1888 Yamanashi had 342 administrative units; today, it has shrunk to 28 municipalities and is still declining. The pace has quickened greatly since 2003.
But municipal mergers are unlikely to be the end of the matter. Prefectural leaders and central government are talking about a radical rehaul of local government in which prefectures merge to form larger blocks--states, in essence. Before this dance has begun, prefectures are already eyeing up the most attractive partners.
To shrink a city
Elsewhere, administrators are starting to think about the implications of population decline, among other things, on running bigger cities. Aomori, a city of 300,000 at the very top of Honshu, Japan's main island, has a policy of actively stemming the urban sprawl that blights so much of Japan. Aomori has a proportion of elderly and single households somewhat above the national average. It also has huge quantities of winter snow, thanks to the moisture that Siberian winds pick up across the Sea of Japan: ten metres can fall in a season. In a bad year snow-clearing can cost yen3 billion: a sum which Takeshi Nakamura of the city government says could build two new schools.
In response, the municipal government set about trying to shrink the city. A limiting arc was drawn around its south side (the north is bounded by a wide bay), and some of the city's main institutions--the library, city market, hospitals and museums--were moved back to the middle of town. Public transport was improved, and snow was cleared from main arteries as well as pedestrian streets to allow people to move easily about the centre. The improvements, in turn, have encouraged new apartment blocks to be built near the centre, says Mr Nakamura, and plenty of older people tired of shovelling snow are moving into them.
Aomori's ideas about a ""compact city"" have been driven by the problems of snow. All the same, says Takatoshi Ito of Tokyo University, who sits on Mr Abe's Council for Economic and Fiscal Policy, the central government should be urging other cities to think along similar lines. Population decline does not mean there is no urban sprawl. Mariko Fujiwara of the Hakuhodo Institute of Life and Living points out that the number of one-person households will overtake all other types this year, while the total number of households is still rising in Japan, to almost 50m.
Kaisha care
Still, the greatest response to demographic change in Japan needs to come from companies. Despite wrenching change over the past 15 years or so, the Japanese company, or kaisha, still plays a more paternal part in employees' lives than in any other well-off society, shaping not just their work but also their social life. Indeed, with long hours in the office as well as punishing sessions in bars with colleagues afterwards, the two are often indistinguishable. Atsushi Seike, a labour economist at Keio University, argues that Japan's problem is less that demography is changing too fast, than that employment and retirement systems designed for an earlier age are not changing fast enough.
In particular, these systems have not kept pace with greatly longer lives. True, the government has begun to raise the age at which people are eligible for employee pensions, which are made up of fixed and earnings-related parts. Eligibility for the fixed part has been raised to 62, and will climb to 65 by 2014; eligibility for the bigger, earnings-related part rises to 65 by 2026. This is too little, too slow. Mr Seike argues that the state minimum pensionable age should be raised swiftly to 70.
Meanwhile, companies are also adjusting too slowly. Most firms have a mandatory retirement age of just 60. A recent law requires them either to raise their mandatory retirement age over time, or to provide retraining and re-employment programmes to keep on employees. Most have opted for the latter; since most companies have formal pay scales that reward seniority over merit, raising the mandatory retirement age would be expensive. However, one big company, Kawasaki Heavy Industries, has broken new ground: in 2009, it will raise mandatory retirement to 63 while slashing pay.
Getting rid of mandatory retirement altogether would hasten the end of seniority-based pay, allowing older workers (who in Japan are eager to work for longer) to fill jobs for which they are best suited. A system based more on merit would give able younger workers a leg-up too.
Raising the retirement age to 70 would roughly halve the rate of decline in the workforce. Raising the participation rate of women--at 63% of working-age women, below Britain or America (around 68%)--would do much to slow it further. A number of factors militate against working women. A higher proportion of women than men find jobs only on temporary contracts, which pay on average 60% less than regular work. Male chauvinism still dominates in the office: many jobs are advertised as available only to younger women, while fewer than 10% of professional managers are women, against 46% in America. Meanwhile, companies' long hours (often a substitute for productivity) make things hard for working mothers. So too does a shortage of child care: just a third of children over three and under school age go to kindergarten, compared with an OECD average of three-quarters. Huge numbers of women drop out of the workforce entirely once they have children. In Japan, says Jeff Kingston of Temple University in Tokyo, women have to choose between work and family.
Meanwhile, the OECD notes a positive correlation between fertility and female employment: the easier it is made for women to do rewarding work, the more likely they are to consider having children. So policymakers in Japan are now starting to grapple with the effect of Japanese work habits on the low birth rate. Hideki Yamada, director for policy on ageing and fertility in the Cabinet Office, says surveys suggest that nine-tenths of Japanese aged 18-34 not only want to get married, but often want to have two children. With Japanese precision, policymakers have calculated that without impediments to marriage and child-raising, Japan's birth rate would jump to 1.75.
Policy, says Mr Yamada, should be directed towards making that leap. Attempts began under Mr Abe's predecessor, Junichiro Koizumi, with the introduction of financial support for families with young children and expansion of child-care facilities. Now a novel concept is creeping into government documents, ""the work-life balance"", for which, tellingly, there is no common Japanese expression. In late July, business and union leaders met Mr Abe and other ministers to discuss how to reach such a balance.
""It's embarrassing to say this,"" admits Mr Yamada, ""but after a first child is born, the husband often doesn't do his bit helping out at home, and that engenders anxiety in the wife about having a second child."" That is partly cultural habit. Boys are pampered at home by their mothers and expect the same treatment--no nappy-changing, no washing up--later from their wives. But it is also because of the long working hours companies expect. So, says Kuniko Inoguchi, minister for gender issues and social affairs under Mr Koizumi, policy needs not only to be directed towards encouraging more women to work, with more nursing care for elderly relatives, better child care, more flexible working arrangements and so on. It also needs to make life better for working men.
A better work-life balance is good for companies, which can thereby attract better talent. It is also good for working men, says Mrs Inoguchi. They can enjoy a proper private life, spending more time at home--always assuming, and it is no foregone conclusion, that Japanese wives are prepared to tolerate them there.

Male chauvinism still dominates in the office : many jobs are advertised as available only to younger women , while fewer than 10 % of professional managers are women , against 46 % in America . Meanwhile , companies ' long hours ( often a substitute for productivity ) make things hard for working mothers . So too does a shortage of child care : just a third of children over three and under school age go to kindergarten , compared with an OECD average of three - quarters . Huge numbers of women drop out of the workforce entirely once they have children . In Japan , says Jeff Kingston of Temple University in Tokyo , women have to choose between work and family . 
 Meanwhile , the OECD notes a positive correlation between fertility and female employment : the easier it is made for women to do rewarding work , the more likely they are to consider having children . So policymakers in Japan are now starting to grapple with the effect of Japanese work habits on the low birth rate . Hideki Yamada , director for policy on ageing and fertility in the Cabinet Office , says surveys suggest that nine - tenths of Japanese aged 18 - 34 not only want to get married , but often want to have two children . With Japanese precision , policymakers have calculated that without impediments to marriage and child - raising , Japan 's birth rate would jump to 1.75 . 
 Policy , says Mr Yamada , should be directed towards making that leap . Attempts began under Shinzo Abe's predecessor , Junichiro Koizumi , with the introduction of financial support for families with young children and expansion of child - care facilities . Now a novel concept is creeping into government documents , "" the work - life balance "" , for which , tellingly , there is no common Japanese expression . In late July , business and union leaders met Shinzo Abe and other ministers to discuss how to reach such a balance . 
 "" It 's embarrassing to say this , "" admits Mr Yamada , "" but after a first child is born , the husband often does n't do his bit helping out at home , and that engenders anxiety in the wife about having a second child . "" That is partly cultural habit . Boys are pampered at home by their mothers and expect the same treatment -- no nappy - changing , no washing up -- later from their wives . But it is also because of the long working hours companies expect . So , says Kuniko Inoguchi , minister for gender issues and social affairs under Mr Koizumi , policy needs not only to be directed towards encouraging more women to work , with more nursing care for elderly relatives , better child care , more flexible working arrangements and so on . It also needs to make life better for working men . 
 A better work - life balance is good for companies , which can thereby attract better talent . It is also good for working men , says Mrs Inoguchi . They can enjoy a proper private life , spending more time at home -- always assuming , and it is no foregone conclusion , that Japanese wives are prepared to tolerate them there .

JAPAN has now had what by any standards were two extraordinary elections, back-to-back and less than two years apart. They were extraordinary not least because they had opposite outcomes. In 2005 the then prime minister, Junichiro Koizumi, called a snap general election, arguing over the head of his own party the case for reform--in particular, the privatisation of the huge postal-savings system, fount of so much political patronage. The result was a landslide victory for his Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) and its junior partner, New Komeito. Yet on July 29th, in elections for half the seats in the upper house of the Diet (parliament), the LDP suffered at the hands of the Democratic Party of Japan (DPJ) its biggest electoral defeat since its founding in 1955. For the very first time it has lost its dominance in the upper house. Despite this humiliation for his party and himself, Shinzo Abe, prime minister since September 2006, amazingly insists that he still has a mandate to stumble on. A spell of political turmoil in Japan seems all but guaranteed.
What changed in two years? That question requires three answers: one to do with the personality of Mr Abe, one with the legacy of Mr Koizumi and the last with Japan's continuing aversion to painful but necessary reforms.
Mr Abe, by a million miles, is no Koizumi. Everyone knew that Mr Koizumi was a consummate showman and a hard act to follow: a possibly unique Japanese politician with a flair for the common touch. But Mr Abe, Japan's first prime minister to be born after the second world war, was picked by his party as a worthy because youthful successor. Since then, alas, he has shown himself to be diffident, patrician and out of touch with people's everyday concerns. On top of this came a seemingly unending series of scandals, gaffes and resignations that have tarnished his cabinet--the latest resignation came on August 1st. Voters appear to have flayed the ruling coalition in the upper house as punishment for Mr Abe's priorities, incompetence and character (see page 46).
The second answer is that just as Mr Koizumi was responsible for the landslide victory in 2005, so he had much to do with the LDP's 2007 defeat. Though by reputation an economic reformer, the biggest change he wrought was on his own party. He declared war on the factions and other networks of patronage through which money and power flowed, and which kept politicians, bureaucrats and businessmen in the same cosy bed. When party apparatchiks chafed, he threw them out or encouraged celebrities to run against them. (Mr Abe did nothing for his popularity by bringing some of the outcasts back.) Mr Koizumi helped smash the vote-getting machine on which the LDP could once depend, especially in the countryside. The LDP's savage defeat in rural areas on July 29th is proof of his success. Mr Koizumi once said that he wouldn't mind destroying his party in order to further his reforms. Judging from these election results, he seems to have done a pretty good job.
A third explanation for the voters' vehemence may bode less well for Japan: that all along they were dazzled more by Mr Koizumi's performance than by his message of painful change before gain. At least in part, Sunday's vote was a vote against reform. With growth spreading through the urban parts of Japan, the sense of economic crisis on which Mr Koizumi played is past. Yet wages are stagnant, while the more depopulated parts of Japan are feeling little of the recovery. Indeed, Koizumi-era changes are starting to hurt: in particular, cuts in public-works spending and increases in local taxes as prefectures shoulder more of the fiscal burden. This was fertile ground for the DPJ's leader, Ichiro Ozawa, who ran his campaign as the farmer's friend and champion of the regions--just like the old, unreconstructed LDP.
Smash the old idols
Some political scientists see the election as a necessary step towards a long-cherished dream--a system of two parties competing on policy and alternating in power. Dream on. Mr Abe's refusal to quit may underline the disarray his party is in, but it distracts attention from the corresponding mess in the DPJ. It may succeed in bringing Mr Abe down, perhaps later this year or early next, and an early general election may be called. Yet the closer it comes to real power, the more unprepared the DPJ, a ragbag of conflicting groups, will prove. Mr Ozawa, whose health is not strong, does not relish being prime minister, and his backroom style frustrates modernising colleagues. The DPJ shows no sign of being a party ready to hold power.
So an unpredictable period looms for Japanese politics, with the ship of state under the LDP likely to prove rudderless, accident-prone and even corrupt--and nothing better to be expected from the opposition. So what's new? One bright thing: Japanese voters, once so respectful of authority, now appear quick to vote the bums out. Not for the first time, one-party rule in Japan seems doomed. Sadly, it is liable to limp on until an opposition that looks fit to govern emerges.","But without an opposition that is fit to govern , Japan may be stuck with its flawed ruling party

FOR a land with more than its share of seismic activity, the outcome on July 29th of elections for half the seats in the upper house of the Diet (parliament) was a Big One. It was, by some measures, the worst electoral drubbing for the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) since its long and almost unbroken reign began in 1955.
In cities and in the rural districts that were once the LDP's unassailable stronghold, party grandees tumbled, including the party's number two in the upper house. Of the 29 rural single-seat districts that were contested, the party's bag fell from 23 to six; overall the LDP suffered a net loss of 27 seats (see chart on next page). The opposition Democratic Party of Japan (DPJ) doubled its share of seats. As a result the LDP for the first time in its history is no longer the biggest party in the upper house. Even with its junior coalition partner, New Komeito, it falls embarrassingly short of a majority.
Shinzo Abe, the prime minister, sits in the lower house, where the ruling coalition still commands a big majority. But the vote was a damning judgment on him personally. His popularity began on a high last autumn, thanks to fairly youthful looks and a swift attempt to improve troubled ties with China and South Korea. His ratings have since then slid with scarcely a pause and still have found no floor.
The vote was a rejection of Mr Abe's priorities, which emphasise ideological issues of nationhood, such as instilling patriotic education, rewriting the pacifist constitution and expanding the role of the Japanese armed forces. Many Japanese are not opposed to such measures, but they rate them far below pocketbook concerns: a shortage of decent jobs for the young; stagnant wages; rising health-care costs; uncertain pensions; and swathes of the depopulated countryside missing out on the economic recovery that has taken hold in Tokyo and other big cities. Mr Abe's blunder, contend Richard Katz and Peter Ennis from the Oriental Economist , a newsletter, was to think that the recovery would take care of these concerns by itself.
The vote was also a rejection of Mr Abe's competence--a rather too easy target, perhaps. Instead of filling his cabinet either with eager young reformers or with more practised masters in the LDP's dark arts of getting things done, his generally ineffectual appointments have been responsible for a string of scandals and verbal blunders. One farm minister killed himself before the scale of his corruption became public. His successor, Norihiko Akagi, became the latest in a series of ministerial departures when he resigned on August 1st under suspicion of fiddling political expenses. Mr Akagi had appeared on the campaign trail with his face mysteriously covered in plasters. It became a metaphor for Mr Abe's entire administration.
Above all, voters rejected Mr Abe's character--stiff (his fun-loving wife promises he is different in private) and out of touch. Admittedly, he had to follow Junichiro Koizumi, who charmed the country for five years, delivering a landslide lower-house victory for the LDP in 2005, before dancing off the stage a year ago. And this is why this summer's scandal over the 50m missing pension records dealt Mr Abe such a blow. Mr Koizumi the iconoclast would have boosted his standing by attacking both the bureaucrats and the politicians who protected them. Mr Abe, by contrast, first hushed up the pension agency's ineptitude and then seemed not to understand why it mattered.
The pensions fiasco was Mr Abe's Hurricane Katrina, says Gerald Curtis of New York's Columbia University. The missing records were not his fault and will no doubt be cleared up. But the episode said a lot about the man.
Shan't go
In the past, prime ministers have resigned for lesser defeats. Mr Abe, bewilderingly, refuses to go. Indeed, he claimed this week that voters understood that his policies were not wrong. It is merely ""the people's wish to have us reflect on the things we should reflect on and to refresh our minds."" So that's all right then.
That Mr Abe can even think of carrying on gives an idea of the confusion in his party. Even his political godfather, Yoshiro Mori, a former prime minister, seemed at the weekend to give up on Mr Abe. But if he will not jump, nobody can bring himself to push him--at least, not yet. It is not clear who would want his job just now.
In the coming weeks Mr Abe will be preoccupied with a cabinet reshuffle, even bringing in heavyweights from enemy factions if they can be persuaded. Koichi Kato, who himself made a tilt in 2000 against an ineffective leadership, says that party unity will prevail for as long as everybody thinks they have a shot at high office, but that disappointment will set in as soon as a reshuffle is announced. Meanwhile, a replacement will have to be found for Hidenao Nakagawa, who resigned this week as the LDP's secretary-general. Colleagues say the best candidate is Taro Aso, the foreign minister. But he fancies his chances of succeeding Mr Abe, and could not easily launch his bid from that position.
So Mr Abe stumbles on for now, and colleagues even talk of co-operation with the DPJ. That sounds fanciful. Akira Nagatsuma, a DPJ politician who achieved fame this year for uncovering the pensions fiasco, says that his party's aim is to do all it can to bring down the government and force an early general election (technically none is due until 2009). Even cleaning up the mess at the pensions agency, says Mr Nagatsuma, will have to wait.
The first real test comes in the autumn with the renewal of emergency measures that allow Japanese oil tankers in the Indian Ocean to resupply the NATO-led coalition in Afghanistan. The DPJ's leader, Ichiro Ozawa, vows to block the measures in the upper house--he believes that any projection of Japanese military power must be authorised by the United Nations. Japan's withdrawal would signal the end to its commitment to the ""war on terror"", and strain its security relationship with the United States. The administration of George Bush is mildly alarmed. This week the American ambassador, Thomas Schieffer, sheepishly admitted that the opposition leader of America's most important Asian ally refuses to meet him.
The government still has the ability to overturn any veto in the upper house with its two-thirds majority in the lower one. But it thinks it cannot do this too often without angering a public with notions about fair play. All the while, the DPJ can make things worse by sitting on legislation in the upper house. Such frustrations make it more likely that Mr Abe will be forced to go, perhaps by the end of this year or more probably in the first half of 2008. Once a new LDP leader was found, a general election would then be called. If at any time before then New Komeito gambled on leaving the coalition, the government would fall immediately.
That is when the DPJ's real challenge will begin. The party is riven by more factional bickering than is the LDP. And Mr Ozawa has little desire to be prime minister. Even as the election results were coming in, he was nowhere to be seen--ill health was said to be the reason, but arrogance may have come into it.
A period of political uncertainty looms, then, and possibly new leaders for Japan's two biggest parties. How much it matters is another question. The prospects for farm liberalisation in the near run have gone from slight to nil. New bilateral free-trade negotiations will be pulled from the table. A debate about a hike in the consumption tax as a way to tackle the budget deficit will also be postponed, as, perhaps, will be an expected interest-rate rise by the Bank of Japan. On the other hand, growth is likely to chug along at about 2% a year or so, providing jobs and record profits at companies, as well as paying higher revenues into the exchequer. Politicians may be amazed to find that things can carry along without them.","Humiliation for the LDP , but Shinzo Abe pretends it 's a mandate

The opposition Democratic Party of Japan ( DPJ ) doubled its share of seats . As a result the LDP for the first time in its history is no longer the biggest party in the upper house . Even with its junior coalition partner , New Komeito , it falls embarrassingly short of a majority . Shinzo Abe house , where the ruling coalition still commands a big majority . But the vote was a damning judgment on Shinzo Abe . Shinzo Abe's popularity began on a high last autumn , thanks to fairly youthful looks and a swift attempt to improve troubled ties with China and South Korea . Shinzo Abe's ratings have since then slid with scarcely a pause and still have found no floor . 
 The vote was a rejection of Shinzo Abe's priorities , which emphasise ideological issues of nationhood , such as instilling patriotic education , rewriting the pacifist constitution and expanding the role of the Japanese armed forces . Many Japanese are not opposed to such measures , but they rate them far below pocketbook concerns : a shortage of decent jobs for the young ; stagnant wages ; rising health - care costs ; uncertain pensions ; and swathes of the depopulated countryside missing out on the economic recovery that has taken hold in Tokyo and other big cities . Shinzo Abe's blunder , contend Richard Katz and Peter Ennis from the Oriental Economist , a newsletter , was to think that the recovery would take care of these concerns by itself . 
 The vote was also a rejection of Shinzo Abe's competence -- a rather too easy target , perhaps . Instead of filling Shinzo Abe's cabinet either with eager young reformers or with more practised masters in the LDP 's dark arts of getting things done , Shinzo Abe's generally ineffectual appointments have been responsible for a string of scandals and verbal blunders . One farm minister killed himself before the scale of his corruption became public . His successor , Norihiko Akagi , became the latest in a series of ministerial departures when he resigned on August 1st under suspicion of fiddling political expenses . Mr Akagi had appeared on the campaign trail with his face mysteriously covered in plasters . It became a metaphor for Shinzo Abe's entire administration . 
 Above all , voters rejected Shinzo Abe's character -- stiff ( Shinzo Abe's fun - loving wife promises Shinzo Abe is different in private ) and out of touch . Admittedly , Shinzo Abe had to follow Junichiro Koizumi , who charmed the country for five years , delivering a landslide lower - house victory for the LDP in 2005 , before dancing off the stage a year ago . And this is why this summer 's scandal over the 50 m missing pension records dealt Shinzo Abe such a blow . Mr Koizumi the iconoclast would have boosted his standing by attacking both the bureaucrats and the politicians who protected them . Shinzo Abe , by contrast , first hushed up the pension agency 's ineptitude and then seemed not to understand why it mattered . 
 The pensions fiasco was Shinzo Abe's Hurricane Katrina , says Gerald Curtis of New York 's Columbia University . The missing records were not Shinzo Abe's fault and will no doubt be cleared up . But the episode said a lot about Shinzo Abe . 
 Sha n't go 
 In the past , prime ministers have resigned for lesser defeats . Shinzo Abe , bewilderingly , refuses to go . Indeed , Shinzo Abe claimed this week that voters understood that Shinzo Abe's policies were not wrong . It is merely "" the people 's wish to have us reflect on the things we should reflect on and to refresh our minds . "" So that 's all right then . 
 That Shinzo Abe can even think of carrying on gives an idea of the confusion in Shinzo Abe's party . Even Shinzo Abe's political godfather , Yoshiro Mori , a former prime minister , seemed at the weekend to give up on Shinzo Abe . But if Shinzo Abe will not jump , nobody can bring Shinzo Abe to push Shinzo Abe -- at least , not yet . It is not clear who would want Shinzo Abe's job just now . 
 In the coming weeks Shinzo Abe will be preoccupied with a cabinet reshuffle , even bringing in heavyweights from enemy factions if they can be persuaded . Koichi Kato , who himself made a tilt in 2000 against an ineffective leadership , says that party unity will prevail for as long as everybody thinks they have a shot at high office , but that disappointment will set in as soon as a reshuffle is announced . Meanwhile , a replacement will have to be found for Hidenao Nakagawa , who resigned this week as the LDP 's secretary - general . Colleagues say the best candidate is Taro Aso , the foreign minister . But he fancies his chances of succeeding Shinzo Abe , and could not easily launch his bid from that position . 
 So Shinzo Abe stumbles on for now , and colleagues even talk of co - operation with the DPJ . That sounds fanciful . Akira Nagatsuma , a DPJ politician who achieved fame this year for uncovering the pensions fiasco , says that his party 's aim is to do all it can to bring down the government and force an early general election ( technically none is due until 2009 ) . Even cleaning up the mess at the pensions agency , says Mr Nagatsuma , will have to wait . 
 The first real test comes in the autumn with the renewal of emergency measures that allow Japanese oil tankers in the Indian Ocean to resupply the NATO - led coalition in Afghanistan . The DPJ 's leader , Ichiro Ozawa , vows to block the measures in the upper house -- he believes that any projection of Japanese military power must be authorised by the United Nations . Japan 's withdrawal would signal the end to its commitment to the "" war on terror "" , and strain its security relationship with the United States . The administration of George Bush is mildly alarmed . This week the American ambassador , Thomas Schieffer , sheepishly admitted that the opposition leader of America 's most important Asian ally refuses to meet him . 
 The government still has the ability to overturn any veto in the upper house with its two - thirds majority in the lower one . But it thinks it can not do this too often without angering a public with notions about fair play . All the while , the DPJ can make things worse by sitting on legislation in the upper house . Such frustrations make it more likely that Shinzo Abe will be forced to go , perhaps by the end of this year or more probably in the first half of 2008 . Once a new LDP leader was found , a general election would then be called . If at any time before then New Komeito gambled on leaving the coalition , the government would fall immediately . 
 That is when the DPJ 's real challenge will begin . The party is riven by more factional bickering than is the LDP . And Mr Ozawa has little desire to be prime minister . Even as the election results were coming in , he was nowhere to be seen -- ill health was said to be the reason , but arrogance may have come into it . 
 A period of political uncertainty looms , then , and possibly new leaders for Japan 's two biggest parties . How much it matters is another question . The prospects for farm liberalisation in the near run have gone from slight to nil . New bilateral free - trade negotiations will be pulled from the table . A debate about a hike in the consumption tax as a way to tackle the budget deficit will also be postponed , as , perhaps , will be an expected interest - rate rise by the Bank of Japan . On the other hand , growth is likely to chug along at about 2 % a year or so , providing jobs and record profits at companies , as well as paying higher revenues into the exchequer . Politicians may be amazed to find that things can carry along without them .",740,Japan,A30-183,IN TERM,True,Shinzo Abe,36,True

FOR India's government, despite the hubbub in Parliament and barely veiled threats from its neighbour, Pakistan, the controversial deal it struck last month with America to allow civil nuclear co-operation between the two countries is already radiating success. Shinzo Abe, Japan's prime minister, was in Delhi this week to cement a ""strategic partnership"", despite Japan's decades-long discomfort with India's bomb. Meanwhile, Australia's cabinet, hitherto resolute in its refusal to sell uranium to any country outside the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (and only to a select few within it), has taken its cue from America and agreed in principle to sell uranium to India, even though India hasn't signed the NPT, and won't.
India is breaking out of the nuclear quarantine imposed after its first ""peaceful"" nuclear test in 1974. But for commerce to resume, it must first agree with the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) which safeguards will apply to nuclear facilities it has designated ""civilian"". It will then need an exemption from the 45-nation Nuclear Suppliers Group (NSG), which bars nuclear trade with countries, such as India, that refuse to apply such international safeguards to all their nuclear facilities. Some governments are deeply unhappy at carving an India-sized hole in the nuclear rules. But none has yet vetoed it.
Unlike North Korea and Iran, which signed the NPT and then violated its rules, India (like Pakistan and Israel) never signed the treaty; its bombs are not illegal. Since no one expects it to give them up, the Bush administration argues it is better to bring India in from the cold and have it take on similar responsibilities to the treaty's five recognised nuclear powers: America, Britain, France, Russia and China. That, say the Americans, would be a net gain for non-proliferation.
This newspaper has long disputed that. Among other dangerous loopholes, some of which have widened since Congress gave its conditional go-ahead to the deal in December, India is pointedly not taking on the obligations and practices of the official five. Unlike them, it has refused to sign the test-ban treaty. Unlike them, it declines to end the production of fissile material--uranium and plutonium--for bombs.
America's readiness to make an Indian exception to all the rules risks snapping two of the joists that support the global non-proliferation structure. At the IAEA, India wants the right not just to say which reactors can be inspected, but when. Such unprecedented laxity in India will make it hard to get others--for example, Brazil, which already does some uranium enriching of its own--to accept the tougher inspections that the IAEA wants as standard for all NPT members.
Likewise, the hard-won clarity of the NSG's trade ban has helped maintain support for the NPT, despite the cheating antics of a few. Mere talk of fudging the rules last year encouraged Russia to break them, citing spurious ""safety"" concerns as an excuse to sell India uranium fuel. China, unhappy at America's coddling of India, is exploring more nuclear co-operation with Pakistan--which in turn threatens to match India, should it step up weapons production or test again.
Sending precisely the wrong message
Japan, the NPT member with the most capable nuclear industry outside the nuclear five, has told Iran and others that they should do as it does--scrupulously observe all IAEA safeguards--if they want to be trusted with nuclear technology. Exemptions for India will convey a different message: first get your bomb. Such rule-bending puts at risk the anti-nuclear regime that everyone else's safety and security is built on. Governments at the NSG and the IAEA that are unhappy with this need to find the courage of their convictions, and block it.","Unless others stand up for the anti-nuclear rules

HAVING for two years glowered at a gift-horse, India's Communist parties are trying to wrench out its molars. A furore has engulfed the country's Parliament over a nuclear co-operation deal with America, the terms of which were finalised last month. On August 18th the biggest of the four communist parties--the Communist Party of India (Marxist)--warned the government of ""serious consequences"" if it pursued the agreement. The deal does not require Parliament's approval. Yet the Congress-led government of Manmohan Singh needs the parliamentary support of the Communists to pass legislation (see table).
This is not new ground. The Communists have indulged in periodic ideological grandstanding ever since offering the government their ""outside support"" in 2004. They have ensured that Mr Singh, a noted economic reformist, has attempted only a handful of modest reforms. Yet the nuclear deal, which took two years to negotiate, symbolises India's fledgling strategic relationship with America. It is central to Mr Singh's foreign policy. India is also getting cosier with America's allies, such as Australia (see previous story) and Japan, whose prime minister, Shinzo Abe, visited Delhi this week.
Mr Singh has therefore refused to concede an inch of the deal. Indeed, it cannot be renegotiated. So, with scant room for compromise, either the government or the Communists will be bruised.
A nuclear-arms power, India has been barred from civilian nuclear trade by America and other countries because it refuses to sign the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT). Now America is to make India an exception to this rule. It would supply India with civilian nuclear fuel and technology provided it submits to safeguards on its civilian nuclear programme and separates it from its military one.
For anti-proliferation diehards, this would threaten the NPT. Worse, under the final agreement, which must be approved by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), the Nuclear Suppliers Group (NSG) and America's Congress, India won further concessions. In particular, it would retain the right to reprocess atomic fuel for energy generation--a procedure which also yields fissile material for weapons--in a purpose-built facility. The final settlement also muddied a central concern: that the deal would be off, and America's nuclear technology returned, if India tests another nuclear weapon. How and when--and even whether--this technology would be returned is left unclear.
At a meeting of the IAEA next month, India hopes to get approval for ""India-specific"" safeguards. It would then appeal to the NSG--a 45-nation anti-proliferation union--for its blessing. America's Congress might then be asked for its final approval early next year. The stand-off in Delhi is jeopardising this timetable.
The Communists say the government should not appeal to the IAEA before renegotiating the deal's contents with them. Otherwise, according to the boss of the second-biggest party, the Communist Party of India, ""there is no doubt"" that they would ditch the government.
The government says it would be delighted to discuss the deal with its friends on the left, but suggests there would be little point, for two reasons. First, the deal could be changed only by renegotiating with America, which would be fruitless and make India a laughing-stock. Second, the Communists object to closer ties with America, period.
This at least is coherent--unlike the objection of the main opposition Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP). The BJP, which led a coalition government that tested a nuclear bomb in 1998, says the deal would impede India's weapons programme. The reverse is more likely. Out of nuclear isolation, India could funnel its own modest uranium supply into its weapons programme.
In the end, the Communists will probably climb down--after all, even if the government falls, the deal will stand. They are anyway not keen to fight an election on an issue for which most Indians--poor and rural--probably care not a fig. Even so, the rumpus may hasten the government's end. Many think that elections, due by May 2009, will now be held next year.
At least the upheaval should encourage empathy between Mr Singh and Mr Abe, whose party took a beating in upper-house elections last month. Japan has big misgivings about the nuclear deal. But Mr Abe's visit repays one by Mr Singh to Tokyo last December and has excited talk of an Asian ""axis of democracy"" against a rising China. Indo-Japanese relations are certainly improving. Japan backed India's attendance at the inaugural East Asia Summit in 2005. Japan, India and America held joint naval exercises in April off Japan. Next month Australia will join them in fresh manoeuvres in the Bay of Bengal.
In Delhi, however, Indian and Japanese officials were predictably keen to keep the strategic talk low-key. They stressed that Mr Abe had come principally to discuss trade between their two countries. It is currently puny--$6.6 billion last year--but could double within five years, according to a recent study.
A huge boost would be provided by a vast industrial zone, stretching 1,500km (930 miles) from Delhi to Mumbai, that India wants to develop as a hub for Japanese manufacturers. Despite the benefits the scheme might bring both countries, its implementation seems almost unimaginable. An economic reform pursued by Mr Singh, a more modest scheme to provide plots of 5,000 hectares (12,000 acres) for industrial development, has been bedevilled by difficulties in acquiring land. A Japanese official in Delhi also expressed astonishment at reports that Japan would commit $10 billion to the Delhi-Mumbai scheme. The figure has been widely touted in India's lively press, which, like parliamentary debate, is an important underpinning of an energetic democracy.","The Communists see red over India 's nuclear deal with America

At least 52 people were killed in fighting in the holy city of Karbala between Iraq's two biggest Shia militias--the Mahdi Army loyal to a cleric, Muqtada al-Sadr, and the Supreme Iraqi Islamic Council, which follows the Hakim family. At least a dozen other people were killed as fighting spread to other towns, including Baghdad and Kufa, another holy city. Mr Sadr told his militia to ""suspend its activities"" for up to six months, though it was unclear what that would entail.
Iran's president, Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, said that American power in Iraq was fast collapsing and that Iran was ready to fill the vacuum. George Bush accused the Iranian government of fomenting instability and supplying weapons to Iraqi insurgents.
The Saudi interior ministry said it would set up a special 35,000-strong force to protect its country's oil facilities against possible terrorist attacks. Separately, the Saudi government banned an influential London-based pan-Arab newspaper, al-Hayat, which is owned by a son of the crown prince, apparently because it criticised some government departments and refused to heed the information ministry's orders.
A Saudi company run by a half-brother of Osama bin Laden said it would secure 1,500 square kilometres (580 square miles) of land in Yemen and 600 square kilometres in Djibouti, on opposite sides of the Red Sea, to build two cities that would eventually be connected by a bridge 27km (17 miles) long, linking Africa and Asia.
Working it out
In another blow to General Pervez Musharraf, the president, Pakistan's Supreme Court upheld the right of Nawaz Sharif, a former prime minister, to return to Pakistan from exile. Mr Sharif expects to return in mid-September. General Musharraf seems close to finalising a power-sharing arrangement with another exiled former prime minister, Benazir Bhutto.
A United Nations report showed that Afghanistan's opium production had climbed sharply. It is now producing twice the amount it did just two years ago, and accounts for 93% of heroin on global markets. In northern Afghanistan the area under poppy has fallen, but poppy-sowing has risen sharply in the south, notably in Helmand province. There is increasing evidence of direct involvement in the business by Taliban insurgents.
The Taliban released 12 of the 19 South Koreans they had been holding hostage and promised to free the others. A South Korean spokesman said the Taliban had agreed to the releases on condition that South Korea removes its soldiers from Afghanistan by the end of the year as scheduled, and stops missionary activities by South Korean citizens in Afghanistan.
Two bombs in the southern Indian city of Hyderabad killed more than 40 people. Another 19 bombs were discovered and disabled. The state government blamed extremist Islamist groups based in Pakistan and Bangladesh. But there was no claim of responsibility.
Japan's beleaguered prime minister, Shinzo Abe, shuffled his cabinet, bringing in faction leaders and political heavyweights from the Liberal Democratic Party. His standing in the opinion polls recovered somewhat.
Up in flames
Just weeks ahead of a snap general election, the Greek government led by Costas Karamanlis faced accusations of incompetence in its handling of Greece's worst forest fires in living memory, which may have been started by arsonists. At least 63 people have died.
Abdullah Gul was elected president of Turkey, at last overcoming the resistance of the fiercely secular army. But a new political battle seemed likely as the mildly Islamist Justice and Development (AK) Party began drafting a new constitution that may limit the power of the generals and redefine Turkish identity.
Russia's prosecutor-general, Yuri Chaika, announced the arrest of ten suspects in last October's murder of an outspoken Russian journalist, Anna Politkovskaya. Several were current or former policemen and intelligence operatives. But Mr Chaika said the plot's masterminds were enemies outside Russia seeking to ""destabilise the situation""--a thinly veiled reference to Boris Berezovsky, an ex-oligarch living in exile in London.

It is now producing twice the amount it did just two years ago , and accounts for 93 % of heroin on global markets . In northern Afghanistan the area under poppy has fallen , but poppy - sowing has risen sharply in the south , notably in Helmand province . There is increasing evidence of direct involvement in the business by Taliban insurgents . 
 The Taliban released 12 of the 19 South Koreans they had been holding hostage and promised to free the others . A South Korean spokesman said the Taliban had agreed to the releases on condition that South Korea removes its soldiers from Afghanistan by the end of the year as scheduled , and stops missionary activities by South Korean citizens in Afghanistan .

 Just weeks ahead of a snap general election , the Greek government led by Costas Karamanlis faced accusations of incompetence in its handling of Greece 's worst forest fires in living memory , which may have been started by arsonists . At least 63 people have died . 
 Abdullah Gul was elected president of Turkey , at last overcoming the resistance of the fiercely secular army . But a new political battle seemed likely as the mildly Islamist Justice and Development ( AK ) Party began drafting a new constitution that may limit the power of the generals and redefine Turkish identity . 
 Russia 's prosecutor - general , Yuri Chaika , announced the arrest of ten suspects in last October 's murder of an outspoken Russian journalist , Anna Politkovskaya . Several were current or former policemen and intelligence operatives . But Mr Chaika said the plot 's masterminds were enemies outside Russia seeking to "" destabilise the situation""--a thinly veiled reference to Boris Berezovsky , an ex - oligarch living in exile in London .

FOR Japan's chattering classes, it is a triumph of experience over youth. In a last-ditch attempt to cling to power, Shinzo Abe, the prime minister, has gambled all on a cabinet shuffle. This follows a humiliating defeat for the coalition led by his Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) in elections in late July, when it lost control of the upper house of the Diet (parliament). Out go Mr Abe's callow buddies and in come the LDP's gang of heavies to clean up after a year of ministers' verbal gaffes, scandals involving fiddled expenses, a suicide, a cover-up of 50m lost pensions records and a general air of gross incompetence.
The new government of ""veterans"", with an average age of 60.4, is in fact a scintilla younger than the one it replaced. Its collective experience, however, is far greater. The new foreign minister is Nobutaka Machimura, who held the post under the last prime minister, Junichiro Koizumi. Another experienced former foreign minister, Masahiko Komura, takes over the defence portfolio. A former defence minister and party heavyweight, Fukushiro Nukaga, is the new finance minister. Meanwhile, Kaoru Yosano, with bags of top-level experience, was made chief cabinet secretary, the cabinet's most important post, as gatekeeper and government spokesman. He was passed over for a job last time round, perhaps because he was seen as being too well disposed towards bureaucrats. His sharp-minded predecessor, Yasuhisa Shiozaki, had declared war on the bureaucracy. A particular buddy of Mr Abe's, Mr Shiozaki lacks Mr Yosano's tact, charm and political connections.
As well as revamping the government, Mr Abe has attempted to fortify the party structure. His suave former foreign minister, Taro Aso, has moved to become the LDP's secretary-general: both men are grandchildren of former prime ministers and both have a hawkish view on foreign policy. Almost the only Abe buddy to remain in an influential post is the LDP's new policy head, Nobuteru Ishihara, son of Tokyo's talk-from-the-hip governor.
Opinion polls gave a swift verdict: Mr Abe's popularity, which had plumbed abysmal depths, shot up. Yet questions abound. For a start, the office-expense scandals that tainted members of Mr Abe's first government could spread to the entire political establishment: with politicians less able to distribute public largesse these days, fiddling petty expenses is, short of reaching into one's own pocket, almost the only way to be able to entertain loyal constituents when they come calling in Tokyo.
Moreover, Mr Abe's move to tap the party strongmen should be seen as just another sign of his fragility. Gone are most of his special advisers, who were supposed to strengthen the prime minister's executive powers at the expense of the party. In Mr Machimura, Mr Komura and Mr Aso, the prime minister has appointed party-faction heads; nearly every other faction has also been rewarded. Even one of Mr Abe's fiercest critics, Yoichi Masuzoe, who called for his resignation after the upper-house defeat, has been made minister of health and welfare--admittedly an unenviable job, since he must clean up the mess of the missing pensions records.
It all smells too much of the LDP's rank pre-Koizumi days, of jobs for the boys. Mr Abe probably calculates that by spreading favours he can stop a party in disarray from turning on him. Yet even his own political godfather, Yoshiro Mori--a disastrous past prime minister who nevertheless fancies himself the LDP's kingmaker and is peeved that Mr Abe has not heeded all his advice--was ominous. He called the new cabinet an improvement: more like a kindergarten's second year than the first.
There is also the tricky question of quite what the new government stands for. Mr Abe has dropped his constant theme of national pride and now listens, he says, to economic concerns. What, then, of his supposed reform programme? To deal with the hideous cost of farm subsidies, Mr Abe has appointed an affable farmer's friend as agriculture minister.
Though Mr Yosano, the chief secretary, is a firm advocate of raising the consumption tax to plug Japan's budget deficits and pay for future pensions, Mr Abe appears in no mood to launch such a debate. Further cuts in public spending appear to have been shelved, moves towards more government decentralisation are meeting resistance, and senior government employees are up in arms at plans to prevent them from being parachuted into cosy retirement jobs in industries they formerly regulated. ""We must"", says Mr Abe, ""carry out policies."" Quite. But what they are, no one is telling. Amid political chaos, the chief beneficiaries are the bureaucrats.
As for the opposition Democratic Party of Japan (DPJ), it will do its utmost to use its upper-house majority to bring down Mr Abe, once the Diet reconvenes for a special session in September. The first and crucial test is the extension of emergency ""anti-terror"" measures, due to expire on November 1st, that allow Japan to keep refuelling ships in the Indian Ocean to help the American-led efforts in Afghanistan. The DPJ's leader, Ichiro Ozawa, says the upper house will block the extension. Shigeru Ishiba, a former LDP defence minister, says that if Japan pulled out, even temporarily, it would deal an irreparable blow to its international reputation. If a compromise cannot be reached, he wants Mr Abe to use his remaining authority to seek a two-thirds majority in the lower house to overrule the upper house. If Mr Abe caves in to Mr Ozawa, and ""jeopardises the national interest just in order to survive,"" says Mr Ishiba, ""there is no point in his government existing."" Mr Abe has bought time, but perhaps not much.","Shinzo Abe brings in the heavies , but remains unbearably light

PROGRESS, of sorts: on September 1st and 2nd in Geneva, negotiators from the United States and North Korea reaffirmed what in essence had been agreed in February but had then met obstacles. North Korea would declare and disable its nuclear programmes; America would, among other outstanding bilateral issues, start the process of taking North Korea off its list of state sponsors of terrorism.
Not for the first time, disagreement arose at once about what had actually been negotiated. Christopher Hill, the chief American envoy, denied that his country was about to take North Korea off the blacklist, as his counterpart, Kim Kye Gwan, had claimed. That depended, Mr Hill said, on North Korea's future efforts towards denuclearisation. But even North Korea agreed that it had committed itself to declaring and disabling all its programmes by the end of the year.
It is a promise that Mr Hill badly wanted, after the schedule laid out in February had been thrown back by a tangle over North Korean funds frozen in a Macau bank. In practice, North Korea could in a jiffy declare what it possesses, if it chose to. So what remains as uncertain as ever--perhaps even to that dark country's regime itself--is North Korea's strategic intent. Whether the deadline is a declaration in name only, or some way forward on substance, matters to those other members of the six-party talks--America, South Korea, China, Japan and Russia--who want a Korean peninsula free of nuclear weapons. To that end, there is not just the question of North Korea's declaration and disablement of its nuclear programmes, but also their complete dismantlement. That was not spelled out in the February agreement. But it was central to the agreement's parent deal, reached in September 2005 before North Korea stalked off in a huff.
What remains unclear is the level of scrutiny North Korea will now allow. International inspectors this summer confirmed that the North had shut down and sealed the Yongbyon reactor and reprocessing plant responsible for producing the plutonium for the bomb that was exploded last October. Other sites were also sealed. But there is presumably much more to inspect, including facilities for enriching uranium. Were North Korea to declare all its facilities, not even the most fervent admirers of Kim Jong Il, its strange dictator, would take it at its word. A declaration followed by a refusal to allow intrusive inspections would also be a joke. And if North Korea claimed to have disposed of all its nuclear stuff, then it would need to be traced to its new owners.
Beyond such fundamental doubts, there remains the tactical question of sequencing. In return for dismantlement, North Korea has been promised aid and other goodies, starting with 950,000 tonnes of fuel oil. The problem, says a diplomat from Japan, which is expecting to pay for a good chunk of the aid, is working out a way to ensure that North Korea sticks to a timetable of dismantlement even as it gets regular deliveries of aid. This is something that will presumably be debated at the plenary sessions of the six-party talks in Beijing later this month.
Meanwhile, Japan has its own worries. It insists that North Korea must come clean about Japanese citizens kidnapped during the 1970s and 1980s--a big political issue at home. At bilateral meetings in Hanoi in March, North Korea tried to engineer a split between Japan and other members of the six-party talks, blaming Japan for holding up progress with its obsessive harping on this topic.
Since then, Japanese officials say that Shinzo Abe, the prime minister, has had cast-iron assurances from President George Bush that America will not take steps towards normalising ties with North Korea--including removing it from the terrorism blacklist--until the abductee issue is resolved. Japan wants detailed records of all those abducted and what became of them. Once North Korea has come clean about this, says a diplomat, Japan will show the greatest flexibility. As The Economist went to press, Japan and North Korea were meeting in Mongolia to discuss the abductees. At the least, the mood music from Ulan Bator was very much less discordant than it was in Hanoi.","The music is more cheerful, but the libretto is hard to take seriously

NOTHING in Shinzo Abe's occupation of the Japanese prime minister's office became him like the leaving of it: he made a mess of that too. But his departure on September 12th should be an occasion for more than lamenting his hapless year in office. The trouble is not one lousy prime minister but a political system that no longer works. The reign of Mr Abe's starry predecessor, Junichiro Koizumi, helped disguise this failure. But he, not Mr Abe, was the aberration.
Ill health may have precipitated the present crisis by forcing Mr Abe's final blunder: the poor timing of his resignation. But thanks to a sorry saga of his cabinet's incompetence, corruption and ill-fortune (see page 73) his poll ratings have been plumbing new depths for most of the year. At the end of July voters delivered the most damning of verdicts on his tenure, with a crushing defeat for his Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) in the upper house of the Diet, or parliament, where, for the first time since 1955, it is no longer the biggest party. In the past Japanese prime ministers have fallen on their metaphorical swords for much less. Yet he refused to resign. He then bought himself a little time by shuffling his cabinet, bringing in some LDP heavy-hitters who recalled the party's history of corrupt faction-ridden politicking, but at least, in the public eye, went some way to filling the government's competence deficit. He opened parliament, attended a regional summit in Sydney and then made a big policy speech on September 10th.
Two days later he stood down on the flimsiest of excuses: that Ichiro Ozawa, leader of the main opposition Democratic Party of Japan (DPJ), had refused to meet him to discuss a compromise over extending important anti-terrorism legislation. If Mr Ozawa did indeed refuse a meeting, it should surely have been taken merely as one skirmish in a campaign--for extension of the law--that Mr Abe regards as vitally important for Japan, rather than as a pretext for surrender.
Mr Abe is right that the lapsing of the law, which would entail Japan's calling off its operations refuelling ships in the Indian Ocean for the American-led campaign in Afghanistan, would damage Japan's international standing. But his staking his position on the issue highlights four big problems facing the Japanese electorate. The first is that too many LDP leaders, including Mr Abe and his most likely successor, Taro Aso, are obsessed with Japan's international stature and have lost touch with voters. They want to amend the pacifist constitution so that Japan can play a role in the world commensurate with its economic might. Voters are more interested in the economic might itself, and what it could do for them.
That is the second problem. Mr Koizumi's flair and common touch enabled him to sell voters a bill of goods which, on closer inspection, they do not like. His liberalising, market-friendly reforms will, if followed through, do much to sustain Japan's recent economic revival. But in the short term they are bringing pain to many areas. Unlike Mr Abe, Mr Koizumi timed his departure well.
Third, the DPJ's ability to stall and ultimately thwart the anti-terror legislation is not a temporary phenomenon. The next upper-house elections are six years away; it may be 12 before the LDP wins its majority back. After a Koizumi-inspired landslide in the 2005 lower-house elections, the LDP can carry on governing. But Mr Ozawa has a stranglehold.
Enough shuffling: time for a new deck
That would not matter so much if he led a party that might form a credible government. He does not: indeed, he himself does not want to be prime minister and is in poor health. The fourth big problem is the lack of a serious opposition. The DPJ is less a coherent party than a job lot of competing factions: rather like the LDP, in fact, but without the experience of more than 50 years of nearly uninterrupted power.
That one party has held sway for so long is of course itself a symptom of the sickness affecting Japanese politics. That is why many in Japan are hoping that the present mess does not, as usual, produce merely a factional compromise around an uninspiring new prime minister. Mr Koizumi is gone. But some of his followers are still around, frustrated by the return to the bad old days. They are mirrored by young Turks in the DPJ. For years idealists have dreamed of a realignment in Japanese politics, away from factional wheeler-dealing and towards true policy-based competition. In the present climate, hostile to Mr Koizumi's legacy if not the man himself, such a reformist grouping would have its work cut out. But the disarray of the big parties is such that it is surely worth a try.","After Shinzo Abe's resignation , Japan needs more than just a new prime minister

BOWING to the inevitable, though with surprising timing, Shinzo Abe announced his resignation as Japan's prime minister on September 12th, after just a year in office. The grandson of a prime minister and son of a foreign minister who had missed his shots at the top job, Mr Abe had all his life been groomed to be prime minister--not least by his domineering mother, who last year insisted he grasp the chance even as grandees of the ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) urged him to wait. In the event, it is hard to think of a less glorious term than Mr Abe's.
It had started on a high note. Mr Abe was relatively young--the first prime minister to have been born after the second world war. He had the nod from the outgoing prime minister, Junichiro Koizumi, who had dazzled the nation with his message of change. A year earlier Mr Koizumi had called a general election and won in a landslide, appealing over the heads of his party in favour of essential reforms, notably the privatisation of the postal-savings system, a fount of political patronage. Thanks to him, Mr Abe inherited not just a huge majority for the LDP-led coalition in the lower house of the Diet (parliament), but also a stronger office of the traditionally weak prime minister. Moreover, Japan's economy was returning to health after long years of slump. Mr Abe's government was initially very popular.
Yet the tide in Mr Abe's affairs only ebbed. True, early on he made a notable opening towards China, with whom relations had been strained under Mr Koizumi. Other than that, Mr Abe proved unable to impose discipline upon a cabinet of the corrupt and incompetent. Worse, he had a tin ear for the political mood. Voters, it had turned out, had been beguiled more by Mr Koizumi the messenger than by his message of structural reform, which entailed pain and uncertainty, notably in Japan's rural regions and among the old.
Mr Abe failed to address these concerns. Domestic policy interests him not a jot. Rather, he pursued a dogged passion for the symbols of a Japanese nationhood that he believes has been castrated by the country's pacifist constitution and abiding war guilt. Mr Abe's inert response to a bureaucratic scandal involving 50m missing pensions records underscored how out-of-touch he was. In late July voters punished his government in elections for the Diet's upper house: for the first time in its half-century life, the LDP and allies lost the upper-house majority, to the opposition Democratic Party of Japan (DPJ).
Not just the opposition but LDP heavyweights too began calling for Mr Abe's resignation. Many a prime minister had resigned for less. That he could claim that he would carry on was a measure of his party's disarray. On August 27th a cabinet shuffle replaced Mr Abe's callow band of brothers with a team of LDP heavies.
That seemed to buy Mr Abe time. Yet the DPJ's leader, Ichiro Ozawa, who vowed to destroy the LDP when he stormed out of it 14 years ago, still insisted his first priority was to topple Mr Abe. The fight he picked was the extension of emergency ""anti-terror"" measures, due to expire on November 1st, which allow Japan to keep refuelling ships in the Indian Ocean. Ostensibly, Japan is helping American-led efforts in Afghanistan--absurdly, by providing free fuel for Pakistan's navy, hardly a frontline priority--though suspicions are growing that help has also gone to Iraq.
Mr Abe cares deeply about the presence: to him, it reaffirms Japan's alliance with America, the basis for the country's security, and proves Japan's readiness to play a more muscular role in the world. He argues that a pull-out of its ships would greatly harm Japan's international standing. No matter, says Mr Ozawa. Though long ago he had helped launch the debate about how Japan could play a more ""normal"" role in the world, the DPJ leader says that the Indian Ocean operation breaches constitutional limitations on collective self-defence. More than anything, though, Mr Ozawa's stand is tactical: his masterstroke is to have challenged Mr Abe on his own ground, by promising that the upper house would block any extension.
On September 12th Mr Abe claimed that his position was no longer tenable because Mr Ozawa refused to meet him. The claim is implausible, and the timing extraordinary: only two days earlier, Mr Abe had delivered his policy speech before the Diet. It suggests a sudden loss of political nerve. Ill health and exhaustion may have had a lot to do with it; on September 13th Mr Abe was hospitalised for tests.
To limit the enormous damage, the LDP now wants to find a swift successor as party president and therefore--thanks to the LDP's continuing majority in the lower house--prime minister. Party members will vote for Mr Abe's successor on September 23rd. The presumed favourite is Taro Aso, foreign minister under both Mr Koizumi and Mr Abe and currently the LDP's secretary-general. Urbane if with an earthy humour, Mr Aso is another prime minister's grandson and leads a small party faction. He could prove acceptable to the bigger factions if these were assured plum posts. But some members will argue that this back-room dealing is just what voters loathe about the LDP and will favour a Koizumi-style reformist.
More likely, perhaps, the party might conclude that Mr Aso's neoconservative views, which resemble Mr Abe's, are not what it needs right now. A caretaker prime minister might be put forward, such as Yasuo Fukuda, a grand old man of the party whose name crops up when the matter of the LDP's salvation arises. But no matter who is chosen, he will still face Mr Ozawa's dogged obstructionism. The opposition leader's tactics will come under closer scrutiny from voters now that Mr Abe is no longer the centre of attention. Still, he has destroyed the prime minister, as promised, and intends to fulfil his second promise: to make life hell enough for the LDP to force it to call a general election. It may be just a matter of time.","Ill health and a newly energised opposition force Shinzo Abe's exit

Sorry.
In a remarkable turn, the job is Yasuo Fukuda's to lose
SOON after he announced on September 12th his intention to resign as prime minister, Shinzo Abe withdrew to the barren consolations of a hospital room and drip, physically and perhaps emotionally broken. No formal handover of power to his chief cabinet secretary, Kaoru Yosano, took place, yet since his resignation nearly nothing has been heard of Mr Abe. It is said that Mr Yosano carries the odd bundle of papers to him. In effect, the world's second-largest economy is leaderless.
Mr Abe's Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) has rushed to find a successor. Elections for the party presidency will be held on September 23rd. Two days later the winner will become prime minister, because appointing one is the job of the lower house of the Diet (parliament), and there the ruling coalition has a huge majority. By contrast, in late July the LDP lost control of the upper house to the opposition Democratic Party of Japan (DPJ), a humiliating defeat that was at the root of Mr Abe's undoing.
It had for months been assumed that the front-runner to succeed Mr Abe, whenever he went, was Taro Aso, grandson of Japan's most notable post-war prime minister, Shigeru Yoshida. Mr Aso was foreign minister under Mr Abe until he was appointed the party's secretary-general in late August in a revamped government and party line-up. Mr Aso, a former Olympic shot and a fan of manga comics, has an urbane assurance that once had widespread appeal. Yet so deep runs the anger within the LDP at the nature and timing of Mr Abe's resignation--unnecessary weeks after the election defeat, yet a mere two days after the prime minister had opened a new session of the Diet with Japan's version of a state-of-the-union address--that Mr Aso's ambitions now look shattered.
Not only is he tainted by association with Mr Abe. Mr Aso also knew of the prime minister's intentions a couple of days before the country and the rest of the party's grandees. It was a blunder for a usually adroit politician not to warn his colleagues of their approaching crisis. With extraordinary speed, disgusted members called upon Yasuo Fukuda, a 71-year-old stalwart, son of another former prime minister, to step in, something he had not done last time round. He has already won the backing of all the main factions and looks poised to become prime minister. Mr Aso's surviving hopes lie with the LDP's prefectural chapters, which cast votes along with Diet members.
It would be a novelty if the two candidates had big policy differences. But as far as it is possible to tell, their views are remarkably similar. Neither wants the LDP to revert to the system of regional patronage and public works that Mr Abe's predecessor, Junichiro Koizumi, did much to destroy. But both want to help the presumed victims of market reforms and budget tightening, most of them outside the main cities of Tokyo, Osaka and Nagoya.
If anything, what differences did exist have narrowed. Mr Fukuda, like his father, has argued for full reconciliation with the Asian victims of Japanese imperial aggression, and his ties with China are close. Mr Aso, meanwhile, is a scion of a family cement company that used Chinese and Korean slave labour, and he has a revisionist view of Japan's past. As foreign minister, he proposed an ""arc of freedom and prosperity"" that conspicuously excluded China. Yet now he claims to be the first foreign minister to welcome China's rise. Only over nuclear North Korea do real differences remain. Mr Aso is adamant that pressure must be used until North Korea dismantles its weapons and explains the mysterious disappearances of ordinary Japanese during the 1970s and 1980s. Mr Fukuda, by contrast, stresses the eventual normalisation of ties.
Above all, Mr Fukuda appeals to his party on style. Greyness is back, synonymous with competence. Conciliation and compromise are to get a chance, while flamboyance is out. Even that consummate showman, Mr Koizumi, with no love for Mr Fukuda, has given his backing.
And perhaps the LDP, for once, is smart. For the autocratic opposition leader, Ichiro Ozawa, himself a former LDP strongman, was counting on confrontation to bring down the government. His chosen issue is the extension of emergency ""anti-terror"" measures sanctioning the refuelling of ships in the Indian Ocean as part of the campaign in Afghanistan. Mr Ozawa has said that the upper house will vote down any extension of operations not countenanced by the United Nations.
Already, Mr Fukuda is unsettling the DPJ. He says he wants to discuss a framework allowing Japan to play a more predictable role in the world's troublespots. The government succeeded in pushing the UN Security Council into thanking Japan and other countries helping fight terrorists in Afghanistan. For Mr Ozawa, this was unwelcome. Many in his party regret the knock to Japan's international standing from the leadership crisis, and do not want to make matters worse by ordering Japan's navy back from the Indian Ocean. One such critic, Seiji Maehara, Mr Ozawa's predecessor as leader of the DPJ, says his successor should follow the party consensus, not pre-empt the debate. As for Mr Fukuda, wanting to survive as prime minister until a budget is passed next spring, and perhaps until Japan's hosting of the G8 summit next summer, he may hope that one compromise wrested from the DPJ will lead to another.

 Above all , Mr Fukuda appeals to his party on style . Greyness is back , synonymous with competence . Conciliation and compromise are to get a chance , while flamboyance is out . Even that consummate showman , Mr Koizumi , with no love for Mr Fukuda , has given his backing . 
 And perhaps the LDP , for once , is smart . For the autocratic opposition leader , Ichiro Ozawa , himself a former LDP strongman , was counting on confrontation to bring down the government . His chosen issue is the extension of emergency "" anti - terror "" measures sanctioning the refuelling of ships in the Indian Ocean as part of the campaign in Afghanistan . Mr Ozawa has said that the upper house will vote down any extension of operations not countenanced by the United Nations . 
 Already , Mr Fukuda is unsettling the DPJ . He says he wants to discuss a framework allowing Japan to play a more predictable role in the world 's troublespots . The government succeeded in pushing the UN Security Council into thanking Japan and other countries helping fight terrorists in Afghanistan . For Mr Ozawa , this was unwelcome . Many in his party regret the knock to Japan 's international standing from the leadership crisis , and do not want to make matters worse by ordering Japan 's navy back from the Indian Ocean . One such critic , Seiji Maehara , Mr Ozawa 's predecessor as leader of the DPJ , says his successor should follow the party consensus , not pre - empt the debate . As for Mr Fukuda , wanting to survive as prime minister until a budget is passed next spring , and perhaps until Japan 's hosting of the G8 summit next summer , he may hope that one compromise wrested from the DPJ will lead to another .

Mr Abe's year in office was disastrous for the LDP. In late July the opposition Democratic Party of Japan (DPJ) gained control of the Diet's upper house. The DPJ will now do all it can to force a general election.
Whereas most prime-ministerial candidates, it seems, are the grandsons of former prime ministers, Mr Fukuda is the first Japanese politician to follow his father into the top job. Until now he has been a man, by his own confession, of the LDP's shadows, and at 71 he is pretty old even by Japan's standards to be prime minister. Yet he has a reputation for competence and common sense, and seven of the party's eight factions backed him.
Acting fast to form a new government, he has drawn on those factions' heavies. Nobutaka Machimura, the leader of the biggest faction, who had served for a month as Mr Abe's foreign minister, becomes Mr Fukuda's chief cabinet secretary and in effect government gatekeeper. Masahiko Komura, defence minister under Mr Abe, becomes foreign minister, a post he has held before, while the able Shigeru Ishiba returns to defence. As for the new party leadership, Mr Fukuda has named faction heads to all four top posts.
The DPJ soon accused Mr Fukuda of returning to the LDP's bad old days, before Mr Abe's iconoclastic predecessor, Junichiro Koizumi, of spreading around jobs for the boys and handing power to the bureaucrats. This is undeniably true. At the same time, DPJ members privately admit that this is a formidable bunch for the party's bruising head, Ichiro Ozawa, to fight. In their tactics they are as likely to try killing the DPJ through conciliation as much as confrontation.
As for the new government's liberalising bent, it is too soon to write Mr Fukuda off. Although sometimes a master of obfuscation, he has been clear on the matter: with its population ageing and shrinking fast, Japan must boost productivity. With high levels of debt, the government must also balance its books--by 2011, before interest payments, insists Mr Fukuda, reiterating an LDP commitment. Certainly, steps will be taken to help presumed victims of reform or those whom the economic recovery has not touched. There is talk of raising the minimum wage. The new government (which keeps 15 out of the 17 in Mr Abe's final cabinet), as well as the party leadership, has its share of budget-balancers and free-marketeers.

The reason is the loss by the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) in summer elections of the upper house of the Diet (parliament). The LDP had been the biggest party there for half a century. Never before have opposing parties controlled the two chambers--for whereas the Democratic Party of Japan (DPJ) now has the upper house, the LDP and its ally, New Komeito, have a hefty majority in the lower one.
The constitution scarcely foresaw a divided government, so the political system faces huge uncertainty. The government of Yasuo Fukuda has seen its popularity rise since he took over last month from Shinzo Abe, who resigned as prime minister after a terrible year. But the government could yet fall. If it survives, it is not clear how it can pass laws. So already murky prospects for tackling urgent problems--a high national debt, an ageing society, pension obligations and defining Japan's place abroad--have got even murkier. Yet among many politicians, a palpable thrill has supplanted the usual drudgery. The ambitious sniff a chance for personal advancement, but also to remake their parties--and even the political structure.
Mr Fukuda's first challenge is to extend the Japanese navy's refuelling role in American-led operations in the Indian Ocean. These form part of the ""war on terror"", supposedly by helping seize vessels linked to the Taliban and al-Qaeda. Japan has a pacifist constitution restricting military activities overseas. But its interpretation is disputed: the DPJ's leader, Ichiro Ozawa, has long believed, quasi-religiously, that only the United Nations can mandate military operations abroad. Mr Ozawa seized on the Indian Ocean operations as a means to topple the government.
Mr Abe said he would resign if he could not extend the operations--and then resigned anyway. Mr Fukuda quickly gave up the idea of extending the current measures, in favour of a new law to authorise the Japanese presence. Suspicions have recently grown that Japanese-supplied fuel was used by the United States in 2003 in the run-up to the war against Saddam Hussein, something America denies. It has not helped Mr Fukuda keep the support of his New Komeito allies; with Buddhist roots, the party has a pacifist bent. Still, on October 17th the cabinet approved a new bill that will now go to the Diet. To appease New Komeito, it restricts the operations to just one year, with fuel to go only towards stopping suspicious ships. In any event, no new law will be in place before the existing one expires. On November 1st the Japanese navy will be recalled. It will prove a deep international embarrassment.
Yet behind the scenes, Mr Ozawa looks in sudden trouble. His own party resents his stubborn, autocratic style. To meet criticism that mere obstruction was damaging the DPJ's image, last week Mr Ozawa offered a vision for a new international role. The refuelling was unconstitutional, he said, but a Japanese presence in Afghanistan itself, under the International Security Assistance Force (ISAF), would be fine, since this has a UN mandate.
To some, this is a brilliant stroke, cutting the ground from under the LDP, while taking the national debate forward. But many DPJ left-wingers are suspicious of all foreign involvement, and alarmed that Mr Ozawa is prepared to put Japanese troops in harm's way--not one has been killed in the 15 years since Japan first joined peacekeeping missions. Seiji Maehara, a former party leader, says that to insist on UN backing is to give Russia and China a veto over Japanese foreign policy. Meanwhile, the DPJ's shadow defence minister, Keiichiro Asao, backpedals from Mr Ozawa's recommendations. Combat troops should perhaps not be considered, but rather specialists in disarming and reconstruction.
What happens next, Mr Asao stresses, hinges on the opinion polls. The upper house could veto Mr Fukuda's bill or just sit on it for up to 60 days--should the prime minister extend the Diet session beyond its planned closure on November 10th. Either way, Mr Fukuda must then choose whether to let the bill die, or push it into law using the government's two-thirds majority in the lower house.
That is a forceful measure, never used before, and Mr Ozawa threatens an upper-house censure. But Koichi Kato, another former LDP secretary-general, says that Mr Fukuda could survive a censure if public opinion is on his side; ironically, approval of the little-understood Indian Ocean operations has risen since Mr Abe said he would stake his job on them. When television pictures show the ships' embarrassing return, opposition to withdrawal may strengthen. Mr Fukuda may close this special session of the Diet and vote on the refuelling law when the ordinary session opens in January. Then the lower house can at least get on with the crucial deliberations over next year's budget, postponing a confrontation with the DPJ.
If the government falls sooner and a general election is called, things get interesting. Some of the grizzled eminences who engineered Mr Fukuda's post-Abe coup--among them Mr Yamasaki, Yoshiro Mori, an LDP former prime minister, and Tsuneo Watanabe, who heads the Yomiuri Shimbun, Japan's biggest newspaper--have long viewed the DPJ leadership as just an errant LDP faction. Mr Ozawa was once LDP secretary-general before falling out and vowing revenge; his own secretary-general, once in the LDP, is the grandson of a late prime minister and brother of Mr Fukuda's justice minister. Some of these eminences dream they can arrange a ""grand coalition"" between the two parties.
Most likely, the ruling coalition will keep a much-diminished majority, and Mr Ozawa will be under pressure to resign. A way will have to be found for the two parties to co-operate. But other dynamics might also be at work. If the LDP becomes too hawkish, says Mr Kato, then New Komeito could desert it for the DPJ. In turn, modernists from the DPJ, among them Mr Maehara, might be asked to join the LDP. A more competitive two-party system, in other words, might just be the outcome. But that is to pitch hope over experience.","A fight about Japan 's role in the world masks a different political struggle

POLITICS in Japan is typically slow and steady. But in just four days this week, Ichiro Ozawa, the leader of the main opposition Democratic Party of Japan (DPJ), betrayed his own party, resigned over it and dismissed the party's ability to govern or win a general election. Yet party leaders begged him to return, and he did. Stranger still, Mr Ozawa's antics followed a triumph in July, when he led the DPJ to its most impressive electoral victory, winning control for the first time of the upper house of the Diet (parliament).
All of this reflects a new phenomenon: polarising party politics. After more than 50 years of near-continuous rule by the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP), Japanese political culture has almost no experience of dealing with this. In the past, the main adversaries were within the LDP: powerful factions that needed to be placated with power and funds for patronage. Dealing with small opposition parties was easy. They posed little threat. The cohabitation or ""twisted Diet"" since July has resulted in a political deadlock. Not a single law has been passed.
Mr Ozawa's resignation offer came on November 4th. He had, he lamented, created ""political confusion"". DPJ members were outraged that in closed-door discussions with Yasuo Fukuda, the prime minister, he had entertained the idea of forming a ""grand coalition"" with his LDP. This smacked of betrayal. The DPJ won its mandate in July by arguing that only by throwing out the LDP could Japan truly change. Opinion polls suggest a majority of the public also oppose such a coalition.
In explaining his resignation, Mr Ozawa managed to insult his own party. The DPJ, he said, ""lacks capability"" to govern, and would find it difficult to win the more powerful lower house in the election due by September 2009. Only by joining government might the DPJ win the public's trust, he concluded.
He had a point. The DPJ's obstructive stance is likely to backfire. It even sparked the abrupt resignation of Shinzo Abe, prime minister until September, when it became clear that the DPJ would block the extension of a law authorising the Japanese navy's support for America's military operation in Afghanistan by refuelling ships in the Indian Ocean. On November 1st the ships sailed home.
Mr Ozawa is an unappealing but pivotal figure in Japanese politics. After breaking from the LDP, where he had been a rising star, he formed an opposition party that resulted, briefly, in the only non-LDP government that ruled for eight months in 1993-94. Later in the 1990s Mr Ozawa led--and often tore apart--a number of parties. With a reputation for arrogance, stubbornness and backroom dealing, he earned the nickname ""the Destroyer"", because of the damage he inflicted on his own side. Indeed, the DPJ sought to keep Mr Ozawa this week for fear he might otherwise lure some DPJ members into a new party that would ally with the LDP, and lose the party its control of the upper house.
For decades the parties were able to manage Diet strategy through a process called kokutai seiji, ie, basically private dealings among party elders. Ostensibly, policymaking is now more transparent. But the reality is that nothing has yet replaced the old ways. So Mr Ozawa and Mr Fukuda--old-time LDP politicians--tried to do what they do best: a backroom deal.
Without a way for the LDP and DPJ to overcome policy differences and pass laws, paralysis will continue. Already, a host of bills is stalled. Most prominent is the ""anti-terrorism"" law to let Japan's Self-Defence Forces be deployed overseas--the issue that brought down Mr Abe. The DPJ opposes the refuelling, claiming it violates Japan's pacifist constitution. This week it put forward a proposal that would allow the army to be sent abroad for humanitarian and infrastructure work under a United Nations mandate.
The matter is far from a priority for ordinary Japanese, who tend to be more worried about the economic gap between rural and urban centres, and about fixing the pension system. Meanwhile, debate over a bill to control the influence of money on politics has stalled. This is a big issue. For two weeks the public has been treated to daily disclosures of financial improprieties by a former deputy minister of defence. But late this week the parties were co-operating enough for some bills, eg, on the minimum wage and labour standards, to make progress.
Rather than try to win a true mandate through a general election in the lower house, both parties want to delay polls as long as possible. The DPJ, looking even less fit for power after this week's shenanigans, knows it would not win. The LDP sensibly frets that it would lose the two-thirds majority that lets it override the upper house controlled by the DPJ. Moreover, both parties are so internally divided between conservatives and liberals that they seem on the point of unravelling. Japanese politics, traditionally cosily predictable, has become unfathomable.

THE first trip to Washington, DC by a new Japanese prime minister--Yasuo Fukuda of the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) was on his way as The Economist went to press--usually follows a script. George Bush will probably josh too informally with Mr Fukuda, or mispronounce his name. Mr Fukuda will assure Mr Bush of the importance of Japan's post-war alliance with the United States. But away from the ritual, there is no hiding the strains in the alliance.
One is a hardy perennial: how much should Japan pay for American forces underwriting its defence? Japan is pushing to pay less. It is also uncomfortable at the pace of America's rapprochement with North Korea while the question of Japanese kidnapped by that country in the 1970s and 1980s remains unresolved. Mr Fukuda has said he wants Japan to play a more important role in the six-nation talks meant to get North Korea to disarm. But the domestic sensitivity about the abductees precludes this.
The biggest strain, however, has to do with the uncertain future of Japan's commitment to the American-led ""war on terror"". This also lies at the heart of a domestic political crisis that helped bring down Shinzo Abe, whom Mr Fukuda replaced as prime minister in September, and has all but stymied the current government.
The chief manifestation of the commitment was the Japanese navy's presence in the Indian Ocean, resupplying other ships engaged in the fight against the Taliban and al-Qaeda. But that presence was thrown into doubt when the opposition Democratic Party of Japan (DPJ) seized control of the upper house of the Diet (parliament) in elections in late July. The DPJ's leader, Ichiro Ozawa, claimed that the operations breached Japan's pacifist constitution. He vowed to use his party's upper-house majority to block any attempt to extend the navy's presence. The Americans huffed and puffed but to no avail. The mandate expired on November 1st and the ships have been called home.
Internationalists in both main parties are mortified that Japan (not for the first time) appears unwilling or unable to play a role in the world commensurate with its size. Yet Mr Fukuda brings a small gift for Mr Bush. This week the lower house passed a bill authorising a new refuelling mission, albeit one heavily circumscribed: fuel and water may be used not for combat or even search-and-rescue missions, but only to help intercept shipping that might be supplying terrorists.
Recent farcical political events make it more likely that this bill will pass into law. In early November, Mr Ozawa surprised even those who thought they knew him by entering into talks with Mr Fukuda over a ""grand coalition"", one in which he and his party would get plum government posts; the future of the refuelling mission was one of the bargaining chips. When Mr Ozawa brought the deal back to his party's executive, it was appalled. Mr Ozawa resigned, but a party with a dire shortage of good leaders reinstated him.
Such backroom dealing has made both parties look shambolic, but Mr Ozawa's DPJ is in greater disarray. Mr Fukuda now looks more likely to use his two-thirds majority in the lower house to override any upper-house veto of the refuelling bill. The DPJ might half-heartedly pass an upper-house motion censuring the government, but Mr Fukuda could ignore it. This week he talked confidently of hosting next summer's G8 meeting that takes place in Japan.
The irony is that Japan's refuelling contribution was in some ways a token. It became important because it raised the question of just how far Japan should support America. Even leaders such as Mr Abe, who argued for a more robust Japan, believed that could only be achieved by falling in behind American demands.
In Washington, Mr Fukuda will take a slightly different tack, pointing out that Japan's main priorities lie in Asia--implying that Japan should not be asked to sign up to every ""coalition of the willing"" proposed by America. Some Washington policymakers might agree. In a speech last week in Tokyo, Mr Bush's defence secretary, Robert Gates, while calling on Japan to shoulder ""global responsibilities"", also called for a rethink of the alliance. It seems a promising suggestion, but not one likely to be acted upon soon. Mr Bush's administration has just a year to run, and Mr Fukuda may not last that long.","No hiding the strain in Japan's relations with big brother
THE first trip to Washington, DC by a new Japanese prime minister--Yasuo Fukuda of the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) was on his way as The Economist went to press--usually follows a script. George Bush will probably josh too informally with Mr Fukuda, or mispronounce his name. Mr Fukuda will assure Mr Bush of the importance of Japan's post-war alliance with the United States. But away from the ritual, there is no hiding the strains in the alliance.
One is a hardy perennial: how much should Japan pay for American forces underwriting its defence? Japan is pushing to pay less. It is also uncomfortable at the pace of America's rapprochement with North Korea while the question of Japanese kidnapped by that country in the 1970s and 1980s remains unresolved. Mr Fukuda has said he wants Japan to play a more important role in the six-nation talks meant to get North Korea to disarm. But the domestic sensitivity about the abductees precludes this.
The biggest strain, however, has to do with the uncertain future of Japan's commitment to the American-led ""war on terror"". This also lies at the heart of a domestic political crisis that helped bring down Shinzo Abe, whom Mr Fukuda replaced as prime minister in September, and has all but stymied the current government.
The chief manifestation of the commitment was the Japanese navy's presence in the Indian Ocean, resupplying other ships engaged in the fight against the Taliban and al-Qaeda. But that presence was thrown into doubt when the opposition Democratic Party of Japan (DPJ) seized control of the upper house of the Diet (parliament) in elections in late July. The DPJ's leader, Ichiro Ozawa, claimed that the operations breached Japan's pacifist constitution. He vowed to use his party's upper-house majority to block any attempt to extend the navy's presence. The Americans huffed and puffed but to no avail. The mandate expired on November 1st and the ships have been called home.
Internationalists in both main parties are mortified that Japan (not for the first time) appears unwilling or unable to play a role in the world commensurate with its size. Yet Mr Fukuda brings a small gift for Mr Bush. This week the lower house passed a bill authorising a new refuelling mission, albeit one heavily circumscribed: fuel and water may be used not for combat or even search-and-rescue missions, but only to help intercept shipping that might be supplying terrorists.
Recent farcical political events make it more likely that this bill will pass into law.

ONCE it was the Walkman. Then it was the PlayStation. Today it is the Toyota Prius that epitomises Japan's technological and industrial prowess. Built by Japan's largest company, which is now on the verge of becoming the world's largest carmaker, the Prius is a hybrid car propelled by the combination of a petrol engine (for range) and an electric motor (for energy-efficiency). The Prius was the first commercial hybrid car and has become by far the most successful, with sales of over 1m since its launch in 1997. Although that is a modest figure compared with Toyota's annual output of around 8m vehicles, it has transformed the company's image. Toyota is now known for greenery and innovation as well as manufacturing efficiency.
But the Prius also symbolises another transformation: that of Japan itself. Just as a hybrid car combines the distinct advantages of petrol and electric propulsion systems, Japan has been developing a new hybrid model of capitalism that brings together aspects of the old Japanese model, which ran into trouble in the early 1990s, with carefully chosen elements of the more dynamic American or Anglo-Saxon variety of capitalism. The resulting hybrid model has been adopted by many firms and has already helped to transform Japan's fortunes. After wrenching political and corporate reforms, the country in 2002 emerged from over a decade of economic stagnation. Since then the recovery, originally export-led, has spread to the economy as a whole (see chart 1, next page). Japanese firms have restructured, paid down their debts and are now posting record profits. The banking system has been cleaned up. Yet despite this progress, Japan still faces huge problems.
Government debt, at around 180% of GDP in the current fiscal year, is the highest for any developed economy (see chart 2, next page). The government will soon have to raise consumption taxes just to stop the debt from growing. Japan also faces a painful demographic squeeze as its population ages and the workforce starts to shrink. This will put a premium on increasing labour-productivity growth, which at 1.2% is only half the OECD average, largely thanks to the hugely inefficient service sector, which accounts for 70% of GDP and two-thirds of employment. Japan's average labour productivity in services fell from 88% of the American level in 1993 to 84% in 2003. This highlights another of Japan's problems: its two-tier economy, made up of an efficient, globalised manufacturing sector and an inefficient, inward-looking services sector.
Japan also risks losing its edge in innovation. Although it spends far above the OECD average on research and development (R&D) as a share of GDP, this money is not always put to good use. The Science Council of Japan estimates that Japan's R&D is only about half as efficient as Europe's and America's. Entrepreneurial start-ups account for only around 4% of firms in Japan, compared with 10% in Europe and over 14% in America, and Japan comes bottom in several rankings of entrepreneurship. Despite the might of its big exporters, Japan is also a laggard in globalisation, with the lowest levels of foreign direct investment, imports and foreign workers in the OECD. With a domestic market that offers little scope for growth, Japan is missing out on opportunities overseas.
Time for a new model
Its old industrial model, which formed the basis of the ""Japanese miracle"" in the second half of the 20th century, was devised under very different circumstances: high growth and a pyramidal population structure, with far more young people than old, notes Atsushi Seike, a labour economist at Keio University in Tokyo. This old model was founded on three main elements: first, lifetime employment, in which workers spend their entire career at the same firm, slowly working their way up the ranks; second, seniority-based pay, which links wages to length of tenure rather than ability; and third, company-specific unions, which promoted close co-operation between unions and management.
Another typically Japanese practice was a close relationship with a ""main bank"" and other companies organised into corporate groups known as keiretsu, bound together by a web of reciprocal cross-shareholdings. The old model was well suited to the times: it delivered social stability and cohesion as Japanese workers pulled together to catch up with Western nations, and helped Japan to become the world's second-biggest economy.
But the population structure has changed beyond recognition and Japan is no longer a developing country, so the old model no longer fits and many of its strengths have become weaknesses. It hinders consolidation among Japanese firms, which is necessary if they are to become more globally competitive. It prevents the efficient redeployment of labour and a proper use of women and elderly workers, which will be vital if Japan is to cope with its ageing population and shrinking workforce. The old model hampers entrepreneurship and innovation in small companies, an important component of a dynamic and responsive economy. All of this acts as a brake on growth. At the same time, Japan needs to become more closely integrated into the global economy, both to gain access to fast-growing foreign markets and to enable competition from foreign firms to spur improvements in the stodgy services sector. That is why a new, more flexible model is needed.
In the late 1990s, when Japan had endured almost a decade of stagnation, the American model seemed to have all the answers--a reversal from the 1980s, when American firms were trying to emulate the seemingly unstoppable Japanese model. America's economy was booming, fuelled by a flourishing technology industry. Its approach seemed more successful at promoting innovation and growth in the internet era, and its vibrant start-up scene was a far cry from Japan's staid big-company capitalism.
So policymakers rewrote corporate law to allow Japanese companies to adopt an American-style model of corporate governance, and some companies began to adopt Anglo-Saxon practices such as performance-based pay, share options, outside directors, promotion based on ability, pursuit of shareholder value and hiring new employees in mid-career. The banking system was recapitalised, cross-shareholdings were unwound and companies embarked on a programme of restructuring. ""But a funny thing happened on Japan's way to the American model--it never got there,"" observes Steven Vogel, a political scientist at the University of California, Berkeley. Many of the reforms met with opposition and were scaled back. Then the dotcom crash and the Enron scandal caused the American model to lose its lustre, to the delight of Japan's old guard.
Instead, forward-looking Japanese firms have devised a hybrid model that combines elements of both the old Japanese and the Anglo-Saxon model. ""We have been going through a process of trial and error, of what to change and what not to change,"" says Fujio Cho, the chairman of Toyota. The effect has been to move Japan somewhat closer to the American way of doing things, at least in some areas and in some companies. ""You pick and choose which bits you adopt,"" says Hirotaka Takeuchi, dean of the school of corporate strategy at Hitotsubashi University. ""Japan has tilted more towards the Anglo-Saxon model, but wants to go its own way. The debate is about how far to tilt.""
Sir Howard Stringer, the first non-Japanese boss of Sony, the Japanese electronics giant, embodies the attempt to combine Japanese and Anglo-Saxon approaches. ""In our company, as in others, there was a lurch towards the Western model,"" he says. ""My job is to manage that without alienating Japanese sensibilities. Some of the virtues of the Japanese model have to be retained. It is a balancing act, sometimes stimulating, sometimes frustrating, but there is merit on both sides."" It helps that he is a foreigner but not an American, admits Welsh-born Sir Howard.
Finding the right balance
But now that the economy is growing again, there is much debate about whether Japan has found the right balance or whether more reform is needed--or even whether it is time to reinstate some of the old ways. After the departure of Junichiro Koizumi, the charismatic and reformist prime minister who held office between 2001 and 2006, there is a sense that the political momentum for change has been lost. Instead, there is growing concern that the spoils of the recovery have not been equitably distributed, and that inequality is rising--a worrying phenomenon for a society in which 75% of people once identified themselves as middle-class.
""There has been a backlash recently, particularly since we recovered from the recession,"" says Mr Seike. This contributed to the fall of Mr Koizumi's successor, Shinzo Abe, who resigned in September. Japan's new prime minister, Yasuo Fukuda, said in his first policy speech in October that ""in promoting structural reform, we have seen disparity and other problems surface."" He was committed to further changes, he said, but would also address the inequalities arising from previous reforms.
Japan is now at a crucial stage. ""Owing to the recent resurgence of the Japanese economy, support for reform is beginning to fade and the future of Japan can be said to be hanging in balance,"" notes a report from Keizai Doyukai, a business lobby. Much of the political wrangling in Japan, and the various takeover battles and showdowns between activist investors and corporate executives, can be seen as part of the debate about how much more Japan needs to change, and how large a component of American or Anglo-Saxon capitalism ought to be incorporated into the new hybrid industrial model. ""Japan has to Anglo-Saxonise, but in a Japanese way,"" says Yasuchika Hasegawa, the vice-chairman of Keizai Doyukai. ""Japan has to find its own capitalism style.""
Not everyone shares his enthusiasm for the hybrid model, which pays more attention to shareholders at the expense of other stakeholders in a company--in particular, its employees. There is obvious ambivalence about the adoption of American practices at Nippon Keidanren, Japan's conservative big-business assocation, which has campaigned to slow the pace of reform. When there are two models, says Masakazu Kubota, Keidanren's managing director, globalisation means the more competitive model will prevail. ""Unfortunately, the most competitive system is in the United States,"" he says.
In part, Keidanren is trying to shield its more dinosaur-like members from reform. But its scepticism reflects a wider concern. Japanese companies are social institutions, providing social cohesion and taking on many roles that in other countries are performed by the state. By contrast, the Anglo-Saxons view companies as money-making machines that can be freely bought, sold, merged and dissolved in order to maximise returns to shareholders. ""What makes Japan interesting is that it's a society having a debate about shareholder versus stakeholder capitalism,"" says David Marra, a Japan specialist at A.T. Kearney, a consultancy. ""Japan is at a potential tipping point for the next few years.""
Yet despite the current political paralysis, reform has taken on its own momentum. The slow drip of legal and regulatory changes, many of them passed by previous administrations or introduced by Japan's powerful bureaucracy, continues. Individually, some of them do not amount to very much, but collectively they add up to a change in the Japanese business environment. ""Retrospectively, the changes during the past decade were significant, and we are a different country now in many respects,"" says Mr Hasegawa.
This special report will look at four of the most important areas of change: corporate governance, the labour market, the climate for entrepreneurs and innovation, and Japan's response to globalisation. It will examine what has changed and what has not; how and where Japan has struck compromises between the Japanese and Anglo-Saxon models; how widely the new hybrid model has been adopted; and whether it will be able to solve Japan's many problems.","After 15 years of gloom, Japan's companies have emerged with a new, hybrid model a bit closer to America's, says Tom Standage

IN THE summer of 2007 Toshifumi Mori moved back to Japan, having spent 14 years in America, Canada, Britain and Germany working for Mitsubishi, one of Japan's big industrial groups. He was struck by some of the advertisements he saw on the Tokyo subway. Such hoardings, he feels, ""tell you what's in"". Alongside the posters promoting mobile phones and beer he was surprised to see advertisements for headhunters and recruitment firms. ""There was nothing like that 15 years ago,"" he says. He joined Heidrick & Struggles, one of several companies both promoting and profiting from a more flexible Japanese labour market.
Where he worked before, the traditional Japanese ""lifetime employment"" model was deeply entrenched. It is often said that this model is now collapsing and that the era of ""jobs for life"" has come to an end. But the reality is more complicated. For one thing, the traditional lifetime-employment system existed for only a few decades, and only at large Japanese firms; it was never universal. The system is now slowly crumbling, but only at the edges, notes Akira Kawamoto, the director of research at RIETI, a government think-tank. Most of the ""salarymen"" inside the traditional system will stay there until they retire. But the labour market is becoming more flexible in several ways.
Mid-career job changes, once unheard of, are no longer quite such a rarity. The strict seniority system is giving way to a greater emphasis on performance-based pay and promotion on merit. And the number of ""non-regular workers"" (a term that encompasses temporary, part-time and contract workers) is increasing. But much of this reflects efforts by Japanese companies to shore up the lifetime employment system for its ""regular workers"", involving necessary concessions to keep the old system going. Useful though the reforms have been, they have also raised concerns about the growing inequality between regular and non-regular workers.
Under the traditional system, companies hired graduates and then invested heavily in their training and development. To keep workers loyal and protect their investment, they offered lifetime employment on steadily increasing pay, with generous fringe benefits and a lump sum on retirement. Employees worked their way up through the ranks, so age and seniority were tightly intertwined. This made it hard for people to switch companies in mid-career. Women who left to have children found they could return only to more junior, part-time positions. People competed fiercely for jobs at the best companies--but once they were in, their performance made no difference to their pay. ""At Mitsubishi your salary went up by the same amount, no matter how hard you worked. My friends at foreign firms found this unbelievable,"" recalls Mr Mori.
But this is now changing. Young people who start work at a big company no longer expect to stay there for their entire career. Some of them want more of a challenge, says Mr Mori; others ""have seen what happens to people who move to another company and do well"". Foreign firms in Japan helped things along by poaching staff from Japanese firms, offering attractive benefits and better prospects for promotion on merit. ""That creates more mobility,"" says Mr Mori. ""People hear success stories by word of mouth. If some people jump and become top managers, others want to do the same."" This is particularly noticeable in financial services, he says, but is spreading to other industries too. A common strategy is to start at a Japanese firm, move on to a foreign firm and then return to a Japanese firm in a more senior position.
Signs of movement
A greater willingness to switch jobs also reflects declining confidence in the guarantee of lifetime employment, says Sakie Fukushima of Korn/Ferry, an executive-search firm. When she moved to Korn/Ferry in 1991, she says, on average only one in ten of the candidates she called was prepared to meet her. ""Others would say they were not interested in moving or were scared by the term 'headhunting'--we were thought to be industrial spies."" But after the dramatic collapse in 1997 of Yamaichi Securities, a securities-trading firm, there was ""a huge change in psychology"" as people realised that companies could fail. Today, she says, seven or eight out of ten people she contacts are prepared to meet her. ""Many do not move, but they are interested to see what their options are.""
For their part, Japanese firms have become more willing to hire outsiders. With the fall from grace of the Japanese model in the 1990s and the increasing competitiveness of foreign firms, Japanese companies started to realise that they might benefit from outside expertise. There was also a ""Carlos Ghosn"" effect. When he first arrived at Nissan, Mr Ghosn was held in contempt by the corporate establishment. But within two years he had turned the company around, prompting a rethink among Japanese bosses.
More portable pensions have further increased labour mobility. Under the traditional Japanese system, employees qualified for a lump sum at retirement (over and above the state pension scheme) after 30 years at the same firm, which strongly discouraged mid-career moves. But some firms, most famously Matsushita, a big electronics manufacturer, have introduced a new scheme in which employees waive the lump sum at retirement in return for a higher salary. They can then put some of their extra pay into a personal pension plan, akin to an American 401(k), which they can take with them if they switch employers. This is particularly popular with women, says Mr Kawamoto. Workers who opt for it do not seem to be seen as disloyal. The tax system could be changed to encourage more people to use the scheme, he suggests: as things stand, the tax on traditional retirement income is low, but the tax treatment of portable personal pensions is comparatively ungenerous.
Performance-related pay has been another example of Japanese firms' experimentation with American ways of doing things. In some cases it started off as a form of wage restraint in the dark days of the 1990s: companies cut basic wages and employees hoped that performance-related pay might make up the difference, which it did not always do.
The idea met with stiff resistance. When Fujitsu, a Japanese computer giant, introduced a performance-based pay scheme during the 1990s, it proved so unpopular that the company had to scale it back. Managers found that workers became demoralised if they were not given above-average grades for performance--which, by definition, most could not be. NEC, another Japanese computer giant, introduced a similar programme and also had to modify it. Many firms now offer performance-based pay and other incentives, such as stock options, only to certain categories of worker, and keep the performance-related component small.
Along with performance-related pay has come a greater emphasis on meritocratic rather than seniority-based promotion. In recent years some firms have appointed younger chief executives, in their 50s, but many salarymen are unwilling to work under managers who are younger than themselves or who used to be their subordinates. Even within Sony, one of the most Americanised companies, old habits die hard. ""I offered someone a senior job and he said: 'But I'm only 48!',"" says Sir Howard Stringer, the company's chief executive. ""People thought seniority and skill were totally intertwined.""
As the labour market has become more dynamic for regular workers, however, the gulf between regular and non-regular workers has widened. When the recession took hold in the early 1990s, the idea that Japanese firms would make workers redundant was unthinkable. Instead, to maintain lifetime employment, companies held down pay and benefits for existing employees and stopped hiring new graduates. Spurred by changes to employment law, they also began to take on more non-regular workers on lower pay and short-term contracts. Whereas in 1994 non-regular workers accounted for only 19% of the labour force, the figure has since risen to 33%. This created a ""lost generation"" of graduates who were unable to get full-time jobs during the 1990s, got stuck in low-paid, non-regular positions in which no training was provided and found it difficult to move into regular employment.
There are different grades of people without regular employment. First come the ""freeters"" (a combination of ""free"" and Arbeiter, the German word for worker), those in temporary or part-time employment, whether by choice or necessity. Some freeters enjoy flitting between jobs, but many would prefer regular employment. According to a survey carried out in 2003, 40% of temporary workers and 22% of part-time workers said they would rather have a regular job but could not find one. Next are the NEETs (those ""not in education, employment or training"") and the hikikomori, the twenty-somethings who withdraw from social life.
Most notorious are the so-called ""net-cafe refugees"", an underclass of non-regular workers who cannot afford accommodation in the cities where they work and instead sleep in rented cubicles in internet cafes. A recent government report put the number of such ""refugees"" at some 5,400 nationwide. That is not a lot, but it highlights an area of growing concern: inequality was one of the issues on which the Democratic Party of Japan fought its successful upper-house election campaign in July which led to the downfall of the prime minister, Shinzo Abe.
The protection of regular workers, in short, has come at the cost of a growing army of non-regular workers. The irony is that companies that claim to be committed to lifetime employment can meet this commitment only by cutting back on hiring regular workers and relying increasingly on non-regular workers. ""Toyota and Canon say they are still keeping lifetime employment, but to do so they are introducing a large number of non-regular workers,"" says Keio University's Mr Seike. Canon, for example, now employs 70% of its factory workers on non-regular terms, up from 50% in 2000 and 10% in 1995. Non-regular workers typically earn half as much as regular workers for comparable work. About half of them are not covered by company pension or health-care schemes. But although the use of low-paid, non-regular workers reduces firms' costs, says Randall Jones of the OECD, it has the broader effect of constraining consumption, ""so the expansion is still not firing on all cylinders.""
That said, as the economic recovery causes the labour market to tighten--unemployment hit a nine-year low of 3.6% in July--companies are starting to move some non-regular workers into regular positions. UNIQLO, for example, a clothes retailer, said in March that it would turn 5,000 of its 6,000 non-regular workers into regular ones within two years, and Canon said it would do the same for 1,000 of its 13,000 factory workers. Companies are also readier to hire workers in their 30s, particularly those with specific skills, says Mr Mori. That is helping to mop up some of the lost-generation freeters.
The danger remains that Japan will find itself with a generation of middle-aged workers with inadequate levels of training, says Mr Seike. What is needed, he says, is a scheme to encourage companies to invest in training those in their 30s, with some of the training costs provided by the government. But the best way forward would be to close the gap between regular and non-regular workers by reducing the pay and benefits of the first group and creating better conditions for the second.
Tick, tick
The reform of Japan's labour market is being driven by the need to become more competitive and flexible in the face of global competition. But Japan also needs to tackle a longer-term threat: the ageing of its population. The share of its population aged 65 or over, currently 21%, will rise to 25% by 2014 and 36% by 2050. Japan's fertility rate has also been declining, hitting a low of 1.26 in 2005, though it has since risen slightly, to 1.32. But that is still far below the replacement rate of 2.1 children per woman. So as well as ageing, Japan's population is now shrinking. By 2030 Japan will have two workers for every pensioner; by 2050 there will be only 1.5. Large-scale immigration, the solution favoured in other rich countries, is not culturally acceptable in Japan. So it will have to put more women and old people to work in order to maintain its workforce.
To this end, the government has already passed a law requiring companies to raise their mandatory retirement age or provide retraining and re-employment for older workers. Most companies favour the second option: the seniority-based pay system makes the oldest workers the most expensive, so it is cheaper to offer them lower-paid work in semi-retirement than to keep them on as full-time employees.
Japan's elderly are still willing to work, unlike their counterparts in Europe, notes Mr Seike. In theory, older workers could be put to good use training their younger colleagues. Raising the retirement age to 70 would roughly halve the rate of decline of the workforce. Increasing the participation rate of women from its current level of 61% (versus 69% in America) would help even more. Japan's working-age population is expected to decline by nearly one-fifth by 2030, and boosting female participation would be the single most effective means of limiting the decline.
Many of the measures needed to do that, such as reducing the inequality between regular and non-regular workers and placing more emphasis on merit-based pay and promotion, would also improve flexibility more generally, notes Kuniko Inoguchi, who was minister for gender equality under the Koizumi government. But other measures that would specifically benefit women, such as better provision of child-care facilities, are also needed. Only 33% of children between the age of three and the mandatory school age (six in Japan) are in formal child care, compared with the OECD average of 73%. New rules for corporate child-care schemes and maternity leave for non-regular workers came into force in April. Big companies tend to offer child-care facilities already, but 90% of women in jobs work at small firms, which need to be persuaded to follow suit, says Ms Inoguchi.
Japan is doing its best to combine the stability and equality of its old labour-market system with the dynamism of the new. But as it becomes clearer that conditions for non-regular workers need to be improved and more women have to be encouraged to enter the workforce, the crumbling of the old system will accelerate.","Japan's labour market is becoming more flexible, but also more unequal
IN THE summer of 2007 Toshifumi Mori moved back to Japan, having spent 14 years in America, Canada, Britain and Germany working for Mitsubishi, one of Japan's big industrial groups. He was struck by some of the advertisements he saw on the Tokyo subway. Such hoardings, he feels, ""tell you what's in"". Alongside the posters promoting mobile phones and beer he was surprised to see advertisements for headhunters and recruitment firms. ""There was nothing like that 15 years ago,"" he says. He joined Heidrick & Struggles, one of several companies both promoting and profiting from a more flexible Japanese labour market.
Where he worked before, the traditional Japanese ""lifetime employment"" model was deeply entrenched. It is often said that this model is now collapsing and that the era of ""jobs for life"" has come to an end. But the reality is more complicated. For one thing, the traditional lifetime-employment system existed for only a few decades, and only at large Japanese firms; it was never universal. The system is now slowly crumbling, but only at the edges, notes Akira Kawamoto, the director of research at RIETI, a government think-tank. Most of the ""salarymen"" inside the traditional system will stay there until they retire. But the labour market is becoming more flexible in several ways.
Mid-career job changes, once unheard of, are no longer quite such a rarity. The strict seniority system is giving way to a greater emphasis on performance-based pay and promotion on merit. And the number of ""non-regular workers"" (a term that encompasses temporary, part-time and contract workers) is increasing. But much of this reflects efforts by Japanese companies to shore up the lifetime employment system for its ""regular workers"", involving necessary concessions to keep the old system going. Useful though the reforms have been, they have also raised concerns about the growing inequality between regular and non-regular workers.
Under the traditional system, companies hired graduates and then invested heavily in their training and development. To keep workers loyal and protect their investment, they offered lifetime employment on steadily increasing pay, with generous fringe benefits and a lump sum on retirement. Employees worked their way up through the ranks, so age and seniority were tightly intertwined. This made it hard for people to switch companies in mid-career. Women who left to have children found they could return only to more junior, part-time positions. People competed fiercely for jobs at the best companies--but once they were in, their performance made no difference to their pay. ""At Mitsubishi your salary went up by the same amount, no matter how hard you worked. My friends at foreign firms found this unbelievable,"" recalls Mr Mori.
But this is now changing. Young people who start work at a big company no longer expect to stay there for their entire career. Some of them want more of a challenge, says Mr Mori; others ""have seen what happens to people who move to another company and do well"". Foreign firms in Japan helped things along by poaching staff from Japanese firms, offering attractive benefits and better prospects for promotion on merit. ""That creates more mobility,"" says Mr Mori. ""People hear success stories by word of mouth. If some people jump and become top managers, others want to do the same."" This is particularly noticeable in financial services, he says, but is spreading to other industries too. A common strategy is to start at a Japanese firm, move on to a foreign firm and then return to a Japanese firm in a more senior position.
Signs of movement
A greater willingness to switch jobs also reflects declining confidence in the guarantee of lifetime employment, says Sakie Fukushima of Korn/Ferry, an executive-search firm. When she moved to Korn/Ferry in 1991, she says, on average only one in ten of the candidates she called was prepared to meet her. ""Others would say they were not interested in moving or were scared by the term 'headhunting'--we were thought to be industrial spies."" But after the dramatic collapse in 1997 of Yamaichi Securities, a securities-trading firm, there was ""a huge change in psychology"" as people realised that companies could fail. Today, she says, seven or eight out of ten people she contacts are prepared to meet her. ""Many do not move, but they are interested to see what their options are.""
For their part, Japanese firms have become more willing to hire outsiders. With the fall from grace of the Japanese model in the 1990s and the increasing competitiveness of foreign firms, Japanese companies started to realise that they might benefit from outside expertise. There was also a ""Carlos Ghosn"" effect. When he first arrived at Nissan, Mr Ghosn was held in contempt by the corporate establishment. But within two years he had turned the company around, prompting a rethink among Japanese bosses.
More portable pensions have further increased labour mobility. Under the traditional Japanese system, employees qualified for a lump sum at retirement (over and above the state pension scheme) after 30 years at the same firm, which strongly discouraged mid-career moves. But some firms, most famously Matsushita, a big electronics manufacturer, have introduced a new scheme in which employees waive the lump sum at retirement in return for a higher salary.

The tax system could be changed to encourage more people to use the scheme, he suggests: as things stand, the tax on traditional retirement income is low, but the tax treatment of portable personal pensions is comparatively ungenerous.

HOW much has corporate Japan changed in the past decade? A great deal, say optimists, who point to all the things that are different; not enough, say pessimists, who point to everything that has stayed the same. Both are right. In recent years Japanese companies have emerged from the gloom of the 1990s with the help of a new industrial model that combines elements of the old Japanese way of doing things with some carefully chosen bits of American capitalism.
As our special report in this issue argues, the result is a hybrid, an effort to achieve the best of both worlds--rather as a Toyota Prius combines the range of a petrol engine with the energy efficiency of an electric motor. Many Japanese companies now provide merit-based pay and share options, for example, but not to the extent that American firms do. There is more shareholder activism and more mergers and acquisitions, but activists and acquirers are expected to be polite. And although the older salarymen get to keep their jobs for life, the young are less inclined to offer to ""bury their bones"" at the company that first hires them, and are keener on playing the market and moving around.
All of this is to be welcomed, and much of it has been made possible by a steady flow of reforms. But the emergence of the new hybrid model has been accompanied by the worrying creation of a two-tier labour market. The share of ""non-regular"" workers--which includes temporary, part-time and contract workers--has risen from 19% in 1989 to 33% today. Non-regular workers generally earn less than half as much as ""regular"" workers do, and are denied the generous perks and social-insurance coverage that such insiders receive.
During the 1990s companies placed a greater emphasis on non-regular workers, often reducing or freezing the hiring of regular workers, in order to reduce costs. But this tactic poses a long-term threat both to companies and to the economy as a whole. Non-regular workers receive little training, so that Japanese firms run the risk of ending up with a cohort of unskilled, middle-aged non-regular staff. And their low pay is one of the factors that has helped to hold down domestic consumption, making the Japanese economy's moderate recovery in recent years heavily dependent on exports--something that is now the cause of great concern, particularly as demand overseas for Japanese goods weakens.
Japan prides itself on being an egalitarian society. In a survey carried out in 1987, 75% of the population identified themselves as middle class. By last year the figure had fallen to 54%, and the number of people who identified themselves as below middle-class had risen from 20% to 37% over the same period. Worries over rising inequality were cleverly exploited by the opposition in the upper-house elections this summer, which led to the downfall of the prime minister, Shinzo Abe. His successor, Yasuo Fukuda, has pledged to continue along the path of reform while addressing inequality.
The best way to do that would be to focus on further reforms to the labour market, and in particular to reduce the lavish employment protection granted to regular workers, which is one of the reasons why firms hire non-regular workers instead. At the same time, business needs to extend some social-insurance schemes to cover non-regular workers, and improve conditions for non-regular workers with such things as better child-care provision and more training.
And the rest will follow
Some companies have already responded to Japan's moderate recovery by shifting some non-regular workers into regular positions. Other firms should be encouraged to do the same. As well as addressing inequality, this could help to boost consumption. Reducing the protection offered to regular workers would make corporate restructuring easier. And better terms for non-regular workers would encourage more women to enter the workforce and more older people to keep working in semi-retirement, both of which will be necessary as Japan's population ages and the workforce starts to shrink. Entrepreneurship would benefit, too. At the moment anybody in a regular job who has an idea for a new company has a very strong incentive to shelve his idea and stay put. The labour market is, in short, the point at which Japan's various problems overlap, and where further reform is now most urgently required.","Corporate Japan has devised a new industrial model , but further reform is still needed

IN JAPAN'S dynastic politics, even foreign policy is a family business. The most recent prime minister, Shinzo Abe, was the grandson of one prime minister; the incumbent, Yasuo Fukuda, is the first prime minister to follow his father's footsteps into office.
The hawkish Mr Abe indulged in occasional revisionism over Japan's rapine wartime past and espoused a sweeping ""arc of freedom and prosperity"" that was supposed to anchor Japan in a Eurasian community of democratic nations but was in practice a not-particularly-subtle attempt to throw a cordon around a rising China. Though the arc languishes as official policy on the foreign ministry's website, it has in practice been abandoned by Mr Abe's successor.
Thirty years ago Mr Fukuda senior went to Manila and promised South-East Asia that Japan had forever renounced aggression against its neighbours, and would do everything to build confidence and mutual respect. This became known as the Fukuda doctrine. In the practice of it, Mr Fukuda pere opened diplomatic relations with China. Now, Mr Fukuda fils is proving a chip off the old block.
Late last month at the 16-country East Asia Summit in Singapore, the younger Mr Fukuda looked singularly at ease schmoozing with Asia's leaders, most of whom say they value discretion over confrontation. In effect, he assured them that the Fukuda doctrine was alive and well. Though there is no question of Japan abandoning its 60-year alliance with the United States (and neighbours would no doubt be horrified if it did), Mr Fukuda assured them that he would follow a more ""Asia-focused"" policy.
China, in particular, has taken notice.

 IN JAPAN 'S dynastic politics , even foreign policy is a family business . The most recent prime minister , Shinzo Abe , was the grandson of one prime minister ; Shinzo Abe , is the first prime minister to follow Shinzo Abe's father 's footsteps into office . 
 The hawkish Mr Abe indulged in occasional revisionism over Japan 's rapine wartime past and espoused a sweeping "" arc of freedom and prosperity "" that was supposed to anchor Japan in a Eurasian community of democratic nations but was in practice a not - particularly - subtle attempt to throw a cordon around a rising China . Though the arc languishes as official policy on the foreign ministry 's website , it has in practice been abandoned by Shinzo Abe's . 
 Thirty years ago Mr Fukuda senior went to Manila and promised South - East Asia that Japan had forever renounced aggression against its neighbours , and would do everything to build confidence and mutual respect . This became known as the Fukuda doctrine . In the practice of it , Mr Fukuda pere opened diplomatic relations with China . Now , Shinzo Abe is proving a chip off the old block . 
 Late last month at the 16 - country East Asia Summit in Singapore , Shinzo Abe looked singularly at ease schmoozing with Asia 's leaders , most of whom say they value discretion over confrontation . In effect , Shinzo Abe assured them that the Fukuda doctrine was alive and well . Though there is no question of Japan abandoning its 60 - year alliance with the United States ( and neighbours would no doubt be horrified if it did ) , Shinzo Abe assured them that Shinzo Abe would follow a more "" Asia - focused "" policy . 
 China , in particular , has taken notice . Its leaders have not forgotten the father , and Shinzo Abe will get a warm welcome on a first official trip to Beijing in late December or early January . Where Mr Abe used bluntly to bring up China 's human - rights record and its lack of military transparency , people who know Shinzo Abe say that there is no question of Shinzo Abe's raising such indelicate issues with the Chinese . As an early seasonal gift , Shinzo Abe's government last month refused to meet the Dalai Lama , who was on a visit to Japan , explaining that the Tibetan leader was not "" important "" enough .

TEN years ago Japan was on the point of financial and economic meltdown, with a political establishment utterly incapable of facing up to the crisis. Those Japanese who cared coined a not altogether pleasing English phrase: ""Japan passing"", implying not only that the world's second biggest economy was being passed by in a fast-changing world, but also that Japan could no longer even be taken seriously. A headline in The Economist at the time tried to sum up the situation more pithily: ""Japan's amazing ability to disappoint"".
Until recently, that dreadful time could be regarded as an awful nightmare from which the country had woken up, for Japan seemed to be starting to live up to expectations. A razzle-dazzle prime minister, Junichiro Koizumi, came to office in 2001, appearing to bring profound change both to the political establishment and to its ability to deal with economic problems which had festered since Japan's asset bubble burst in 1990.
Mr Koizumi forced banks and companies to clear up piles of bad loans. Companies, thus unburdened, started to make money once more, and from early 2002 the economy began to grow again. Mr Koizumi appeared to have weakened the special interests--farmers, the construction ministry, senior bureaucrats--to which his ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) had long been in thrall and which had supported its near-unbroken rule over the past half-century. In effect, Mr Koizumi declared war on the old-style LDP.
Voters loved it. Under Mr Koizumi's banner of market-minded reform, they delivered a stunning general-election victory to the LDP and its coalition partner, New Komeito, in September 2005. When Mr Koizumi retired a year later, there was a widespread belief that Japan was set fair for economic modernisation.
Yet once more there is talk of ""Japan passing"". The stockmarket has fallen alarmingly since last summer, and has been in open rout for much of 2008 (see chart on next page). Measured by the Nikkei 225 share index, Japanese shares are 27% below last year's July high: deep bear-market territory. Share prices are now back to their levels of September 2005--not even half where they stood 20 years ago. In January foreign investors pulled record amounts out of the Japanese stockmarket. Ask any money manager: Japan still has an amazing ability to disappoint.
The latest doubts concern the robustness of Japan's four-year recovery, during which the economy has grown at a remarkably steady 2% or so a year. Though the most recent GDP estimate, for the last quarter of 2007, suggests above-average growth, many economists point out that the series is notoriously volatile, business investment has probably been exaggerated, and the quarterly growth figure will therefore very likely be revised downwards. Economists at Goldman Sachs said in late January that the economy was already in recession; others who are not so sure claim it is a close-run thing.
Meanwhile, political chaos has reigned since last summer. It has unseated one prime minister, Shinzo Abe, who succeeded Mr Koizumi but resigned under nervous and physical strain in September 2007. And it has ensured only the vaguest grip on power for his successor, Yasuo Fukuda. The chaos was set in train when the opposition Democratic Party of Japan (DPJ), led by Ichiro Ozawa, became the dominant party in the upper house of the Diet (parliament) last July after elections for half the chamber's seats. It has now brought the impetus for growth-boosting reforms, or indeed for any joined-up policymaking at all, to a halt.
So now the LDP's Diet-affairs chairman, Tadamori Oshima, responsible for pushing through Mr Fukuda's agenda, such as it is, despairs that ""investors and political establishments around the world take one look at Japan today and conclude that we politicians are incapable of deciding on anything, not even whether to put one foot in front of the other."" With foreign investors selling out, says Mr Oshima, Japan is fast becoming as irrelevant as it was a decade ago. He asks this British correspondent to prescribe a decent shinguru moruto--single malt--for his depression.
Despair is spreading among the political class responsible for the mess. If the opposition deplored the ""absence of a framework to sustain economic growth"", you might take it with a pinch of salt. But the admission comes from none other than the economy minister, Hiroko Ota, who for good measure says that Japan can no longer be considered a ""top-tier"" economy. Although she identifies the problem correctly, she has disappointingly little to say about how to solve it.
Demographics darken Japan's prospects further. Its population is greying faster than that of any other big economy, so the old will become an increasing burden on workers. Today, one-fifth of Japanese are over 65; by 2015 the proportion will grow to one in four, or about 30m. Now, with Japan's birth rate well below replacement, at 1.32, and with little immigration to speak of, the population of 127m has already started to shrink and will fall each year by about 0.6% over the next half-century. It is predicted to drop below 100m by mid-century. Already, rural regions are emptying, and the shutters are closing on the centres of more and more small towns. Without robust economic growth, Japan faces pain, especially since the government has racked up high levels of national debt in an attempt to spend its way out of its post-bubble slump.
The bureaucrats' blunders
Even though companies are far sounder than they were a decade ago, with fewer debts and more focused operations, Japan's productivity is still pitifully low. A lack of investment is not the problem. Rather, low interest rates, an export boom and a business environment in which managers are scarcely accountable to shareholders may have generated too much of the stuff. Indeed, as Andrew Smithers of Smithers & Co points out, high investment and slow growth mean that Japan's return on new investment is around half the level in America. At least companies, notably Japan's exporters, have been making record profits. But now the impact on exports of higher oil prices, coupled with a sharp rise in the yen since last summer--a consequence largely of financial-market volatility--throws that profitability into question. That is even before considering what harm an American-led slowdown might do.
Were Japan's recovery broad-based, an export slowdown would matter less, because domestic consumption would take up the slack. Yet despite repeated predictions from economists, household spending has failed to follow a rise in business investment and exports.
The reason again lies with companies. Even where they have been making record profits, companies have hoarded their cash rather than pay more out in the form of higher wages, which have stagnated even as employment has increased. Now that a stronger yen and dearer oil are eating into profit margins, the situation may not improve soon. As a result, Mr Smithers notes, even after drawing down savings this decade, households still consume a smaller proportion of GDP than in any other rich country. It raises a question: was the path that Mr Koizumi chose to get Japan out of the economic swamp misguided, at least in part? By emphasising low interest rates (good for indebted companies but bad for savers) and low wages (ditto) to help companies out of their mess, Japan's economy has depended too much on exports and is now worryingly vulnerable to external shocks.
Politicians complain about firms' tendency to hoard cash, and urge firms to pay workers more. Yet the incompetence and unpredictability of politicians helps explain the companies' caution. A year ago, for instance, in a well-intentioned attempt to crack down on predatory lending, the government all but destroyed the consumer-finance industry.
A more serious episode still started last summer, when a system for vetting new buildings was introduced in reaction to the faking of earthquake-proofing data--itself a reaction to hasty new regulation brought in a few years back. The housing ministry was unable to get new software for the new system running in time. New-building approvals ground to a halt, and new construction fell by 40%.
Slowly, matters are righting themselves--new construction in December was just one-fifth below levels a year earlier. But the extraordinary effect of a single bureaucratic bungle has been to knock 0.6 percentage points off Japan's growth. The building-standards fiasco was one reason for the reduction in the government's growth forecast for the fiscal year to the end of March, from 2.1% to 1.3%.
These costly blunders were committed even before July's elections divided the Diet; with the current political chaos, the risks of things going wrong is still higher. The incompetence of politicians and bureaucrats does not just lead to expensive short-term disasters; it also threatens Japan's long-term growth prospects.
Japan needs a mass of economic reforms--a more open climate to foreign investment, for instance, lower tariffs on imported food, fewer subsidies for farmers, freer trade, better tax treatment of foreign companies, the abolition of a welter of business subsidies, a more flexible labour market, greater fiscal rectitude (national debt is currently around 180% of GDP), more accountability by pension funds and insurance companies, further privatisation of services and much more. Takatoshi Ito of Tokyo University, who sits on the Council on Economic and Fiscal Policy, the government's advisory body that drove structural reform during the Koizumi years, has calculated the economic benefit of pursuing the reforms the CEFP advocates, and the costs of abandoning them. Pursue reform, he argues, and Japan should be able to grow at a respectable 2% a year. Abandon it, and growth will crawl along at 1-1.4%.
And crawl it will, if Mr Ito is right, because Japan has abandoned reform. Blame a political establishment of underwhelming talent and vision, and an almighty constitutional mess.
First in line for blame is Mr Abe. Though he came to office as a self-styled reformer, nothing he has ever said or done suggests an interest in improving the economy. Once in office, he seems to have calculated that Japan would chug happily along, leaving him to pursue pet nationalist themes such as inculcating patriotism in schools. A tin ear for other issues left him oblivious to a growing chorus of dismay at decaying country towns, sluggish wage growth and a growing scandal of bureaucratic incompetence and corruption in the state pension system. On top of that, Mr Abe's government, though short-lived, was dogged by a seemingly endless series of financial scandals. The LDP's upper-house defeat was the punishment. Amazingly, Mr Abe appears to think he deserves another shot at high office--at 53, he is young by the standards of Japanese politicians.
Second in line are the ancient crocodiles of the LDP. In a panic, they closed around Mr Fukuda, who at 71 is the face of experience over Mr Abe's callow youth. Under Mr Koizumi and Mr Abe, decision-making had devolved from the LDP corridors to the prime minister and even as far down as the cabinet. Under Mr Fukuda, power has flowed back to the factions and to the party gerontocrats--notably two former prime ministers, Yasuhiro Nakasone (89) and Yoshiro Mori (70) as well as Tsuneo Watanabe (81), publisher of Japan's biggest-circulation newspaper, the Yomiuri Shimbun. It was Mr Watanabe who arranged the farcical secret meetings late last year between Mr Ozawa, leader of the opposition DPJ, and Mr Fukuda about forming a ""grand coalition""--though he has not since bothered to inform his newspaper's readers about that.
Taking back the car keys
In effect, a generational coup has taken place, with the keys to the political car taken back by the oldies. The result is that structural change is on hold. Negotiations to lower trade barriers with other countries have slowed. Tax reform to set the budget on an even keel has been put off. A senior reform-minded civil servant says that morale among modernising bureaucrats, those that favour privatisation and more competition, has sunk. None of them, he says, now dares propose growth-boosting reforms--as they used to under Mr Koizumi and even Mr Abe--for fear of incurring the disfavour of their political masters. Meanwhile, attacks on foreign investment are on the rise again among politicians and old-guard civil servants.
Mr Fukuda understands Japan's problems better than Mr Abe did. He spelt some of them out in his policy address to the Diet's new session last month: he underlined the need to overcome labour-market rigidities that discourage women and the elderly, and discriminate against Japan's army of workers who can find only temporary jobs. He bemoaned Japan's feeble standing as an international financial centre, thanks in part to hostility to foreign investment. He stressed the importance of putting the government's rickety finances to rights, and he has since championed the cause of consumers.
Yet both allies and opponents alike believe he has neither the gumption nor the authority forcefully to push for these goals. In particular, the government already looks like missing a long-agreed target to balance the budget, before interest payments, by 2011. In the government's latest budget, for the fiscal year beginning in April, the LDP's traditional clients, farmers and road-builders, are getting goodies denied them in recent years.
Third in line for blame comes the DPJ's Mr Ozawa. His party's ranks have plenty of young politicians favouring market-driven reforms. Deploring the one-party state that Japan has largely been under the LDP since the second world war, this bunch thinks Japan would be better served by competitive parties alternating in power. Perhaps Mr Ozawa does, too. After all, nearly two decades ago when he himself was a baron in the LDP, he first launched the debate about how Japan should modernise long before the political establishment was thinking about it. Ever since he stormed out of the LDP, he has vowed to bring it down.
Mr Ozawa's style, however, if occasionally brilliant, is also thin-skinned and autocratic: he does his deals in the shadows without consulting colleagues. These are hardly the right qualities for the leader of a party that makes such a great show of transparency and accountability.
Meanwhile, his mercurial character has only got more erratic. Since campaigning as the farmer's friend--admittedly a successful strategy in the upper-house elections, where rural votes carried a disproportionate weight--Mr Ozawa has come to sound like the old-style LDP bosses against whom he once turned. That unsettles the modernisers in his party, most of whom represent urban, more reform-minded constituencies.
And how else, apart from ascribing a growing erratic streak to Mr Ozawa, to explain the extraordinary about-face last November, when he switched from vowing to bring down Mr Fukuda and his government to cutting private deals with the prime minister? To the DPJ's modernisers, a grand coalition would spell doom to the party, which defines itself precisely by offering itself as an alternative to the LDP. Younger parliamentarians have become so dissatisfied with Mr Ozawa that Yukio Hatoyama, the DPJ's secretary-general, now says that he, and not Mr Ozawa, is answerable to the party caucus. It is a hint that Mr Ozawa, at least for the time being, has agreed to cede some authority.
Yet Mr Ozawa has a gun to the party's head. He knows that a split over his leadership might cause the DPJ to crumble. And should he choose to leave (he has flounced out of parties before), a handful of parliamentarians leaving with him would mean that the DPJ would almost certainly lose its upper-house majority.
Most of all, perhaps, blame two parties bursting with internal contradictions, a constitution that never envisaged opposing parties controlling the Diet's two chambers, and a culture that treats politics as a personal, sometimes family, business, not a means of offering voters choices about how their country should be run. An election would not solve these problems, but it might at least encourage parties to tell voters what they stand for.
Lastly, the voters must take some of the blame. Ten years ago, when The Economist lamented Japan's amazing ability to disappoint, one shrewd parliamentarian wrote in to challenge that. The headline, he said, should have read: ""The Japanese people's amazing inability to be disappointed"". A general election would at least give them the chance to start holding their politicians to a higher standard.

That unsettles the modernisers in his party , most of whom represent urban , more reform - minded constituencies . 
 And how else , apart from ascribing a growing erratic streak to Mr Ozawa , to explain the extraordinary about - face last November , when he switched from vowing to bring down Mr Fukuda and his government to cutting private deals with the prime minister ? To the DPJ 's modernisers , a grand coalition would spell doom to the party , which defines itself precisely by offering itself as an alternative to the LDP . Younger parliamentarians have become so dissatisfied with Mr Ozawa that Yukio Hatoyama , the DPJ 's secretary - general , now says that he , and not Mr Ozawa , is answerable to the party caucus . It is a hint that Mr Ozawa , at least for the time being , has agreed to cede some authority . 
 Yet Mr Ozawa has a gun to the party 's head . He knows that a split over his leadership might cause the DPJ to crumble . And should he choose to leave ( he has flounced out of parties before ) , a handful of parliamentarians leaving with him would mean that the DPJ would almost certainly lose its upper - house majority . 
 Most of all , perhaps , blame two parties bursting with internal contradictions , a constitution that never envisaged opposing parties controlling the Diet 's two chambers , and a culture that treats politics as a personal , sometimes family , business , not a means of offering voters choices about how their country should be run . An election would not solve these problems , but it might at least encourage parties to tell voters what they stand for . 
 Lastly , the voters must take some of the blame . Ten years ago , when The Economist lamented Japan 's amazing ability to disappoint , one shrewd parliamentarian wrote in to challenge that . The headline , he said , should have read : "" The Japanese people 's amazing inability to be disappointed "" . A general election would at least give them the chance to start holding their politicians to a higher standard .

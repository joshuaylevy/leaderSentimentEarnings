BUDAPEST 
AFTER the first of two rounds of Hungary's general election on May loth, the outcome was blurred. The ruling (ex-communist) Socialists, led by the prime minister, Gyula Horn, topped the party-list part of the poll, with around 32% of the votes-a bit less than their score four years ago. But their coalition partner, the Free Democrats (liberals), slumped badly. By contrast, Fidesz, once a dissident student group but now a part of the conservative mainstream, and the right-wing rural populists of the Smallholders' Party both did notably well. 
Winning 28% of the partylist vote under its sharp young leader, Viktor Orban, Fidesz tripled its score and might, if it does well in the next round in the constituencies, get in range of building a big enough coalition to oust the Socialists. It is also conceivable that the Socialists might team up with Fidesz in a ""grand coalition"". Or the same team could hang on. The only certainty is that none of the above-mentioned parties-if their leaders mean what they say-will play with the chauvinists of the Justice and Life party, under Istvan Csurka, which increased its tally to 5.6% of valid party-list votes. 
Why did the Socialists not do better? After all, in four years of government they sloughed off their communist heritage while keeping their organisational network as well as the loyalty of poorer and elderly voters. At the same time they revived the economy and persuaded NATO and the European Union to invite Hungary in. Above all, Hungary's economy now looks in as good a state as any in the postcommunist world. 
Four years ago, it was distinctly rocky. The government was spending too much; the trade deficit looked out of control; the currency was wobbly. Goaded by foreign advisers and by their free-market partners in coalition, the Socialists reluctantly switched tack, slashing welfare spending and bravely discarding the protectionist nationalism that had inhibited reform in so many other parts of Central and Eastern Europe. Banks, insurance companies, utilities and big chunks of industry were sold off, often to foreigners. 
The state's retreat and the advance of foreign investors have worked wonders. The current-account deficit has shrunk from 9.5% of GDP in 1994 to 2.2% last year, with foreign direct investment financing the gap. The economy is expected to grow by 5% this year. Thanks to the foreignowned firms that produce two-thirds of the goods that Hungary sells abroad, exports are driving the economy. Wages and living standards are both going up, though not fast enough to endanger competitiveness. Hungary has become the most western of East European economies. 
Mr Horn's was Europe's first post-communist government to begin replacing payas-you-go pensions, where taxpayers finance their parents' retirement, with pensions funded by the people who will benefit. Selling to foreigners has given Hungarians more than just western-quality goods to export; it has helped revamp its infrastructure and smartened up institutions such as regulators and bank supervisors. Hungary's telephone company, owned mainly by Americans and Germans, has cut the waiting-list for lines from 800,000 to 20,000 since 1993; in Poland, which has yet to sell off its telecoms, 2m people are in the queue. In the European Bank's latest economic report-card, Hungary comes top in all nine tests of progress, from privatisation to legal reform. Among the five East European countries set to join the Eu in the first intake, Hungary is now almost certainly the best qualified. 
But there have been lapses and lags-which is why the Socialists are far from home and dry in the election. Hungary's good fortune has been unevenly spread. Budapest and western parts of the country have had the lion's share of foreign investment People east of the Danube, tenuously linked to the rich west by 11 bridges, nine of them in Budapest, the capital, feel cut off. Even in industrial towns where Socialist traditions linger, new inequalities rankle and welfare cuts hurt. 
The have-nots' sense of grievance is sharpened by the whiff of corruption that surrounds both government and the economy. Hungary can sometimes feel like two countries: an open, competitive one where observance of the law and quality of products are nearly up to western snuff; and one where ties between commerce and politics are murky, the rule of law is weak, civil servants take bribes and everyone seems bent on dodging tax. Before the election, a sense of insecurity was added to resentment against the new elite when a series of bombs and grenades went off(without killing anyone), some near buildings owned or used by opposition politicians. 
Hence the voters' first-round ambivalence. But would a centre-right coalition based on Fidesz and the Smallholders deserve a chance in office? The two parties' leaders still have some explaining to do. Mr Orban, who seemed a thorough-going liberal until he took on a populist tinge in order to broaden his party's appeal, has promised to slash taxes, bolster welfare and make the economy grow by 7%, all without upsetting the trade balance: his figures baffle many economists. The Smallholders' fiery leader, Jozsef Torgyan, is more stridently nationalist-and still viscerally hostile to the Socialists because of their communist past. For instance, he opposes land sales to foreigners. Though they will back each other in the second round, Fidesz and the Smallholders share too little to make a coalition between them a happy one. 
The fear that centre-right rhetoric might become reality sent Hungarian stock prices down more than 8% this week. Still, as the Socialists discovered once in power, if Hungary is to knit itself more tightly to the West, foreign capital and the EU will continue to set much of the agenda. And most Hungarians, whoever ends up ruling them, seem bound for better things. ","Hungary may be the most successful of Europe 's post - communist countries .

AS law student in the mid-1980s, Viktor Orban wrote his thesis on Solidarity's battle against communism in Poland-a brave choice of topic, seeing that Hungary, and its universities, were ruled by communists at the time. Mr Orban may have recalled that provocative bit of scholarship as the votes were counted in the second (and final) round of Hungary's general election on May 24th. For Fidesz, the party he heads, was doing what Solidarity did in Poland last year: booting out a government led by ex-communists and replacing it with a coalition of the right. 
Is Mr Orban riding a conservative wave in Central Europe? It is tempting to think so. Poland and Hungary, the beefiest of the five countries that the European Union has invited to join it in the first batch from the continents post-communist side, have moved rightwards after a spell on the left. The Czechs have stayed on the right since the Warsaw Pact ended. Estonia, another of the EU's first-intake candidates, is againafter a brief hiccup-run by ardent freemarketeers who insist that Balts, despite their Soviet past, are Central rather than East Europeans: a state of mind more than geography. Slovenia, the remaining country in the advance-guard quintet, has added a right-wing component to a government led by pragmatic ex-communists (and has laid good claim to a place in that hard-to-define zone called Central Europe, since shedding its recent Balkan legacy in favour of its older Habsburg one). 
Elsewhere-in Romania, Bulgaria and Lithuania-other right-of-centre parties have taken over. The bloodstained Balkans, with the old nationalist left still broadly ascendant, is an area on its own. And farther east, of course, in the Slav heartland, a mix of nostalgic leftists and quasi-fascist nationalists still has great clout, at least in parliaments. 
On paper, then, Central Europe has certainly seen a swing back to the right, after a leftward lurch of three or four years' duration in which the euphoria of anti-communist freedom evaporated amid the disillusion and trauma of transition. Yet it is hard to say that post-communist market economics, let alone liberalism, has won the day. The big switch is still painful and jerky. Ideology is only part of the reason for the rightward swing of the pendulum. 
Quite simply, voters in Central Europe do not like incompetence and corruption, and once they have voted one lot out, they tend to find the next lot just about as venal or out of touch. However successful reformers are, whether of centre-left or centreright, it takes time-given the appalling economic detritus of half a century in their way-for voters to enjoy the benefits. Good, especially radical, government is not readily rewarded. The pendulum could easily swing left again. 
Or perhaps it may settle nearer the middle, as voters become less impatient and more mature-and as centre-left and centre-right reformers seek the centre ground. Poland's current government is following similar policies to the previous one, which bequeathed its successor one of the fastestgrowing economies in Europe and wangled fast-track invitations to NATO and the EU. If, as is probable, the Czech right is beaten in a summer election, the Social Democrats will probably follow a broadly free-market course. The Hungarian Socialists, though tainted with corruption (like almost all post-communist governments), have done well. Mr Orban is likely to keep most of their policies. 
After all, Gyula Horn, Hungary's defeated prime minister, pulled Hungary back from a debt crisis, reformed pensions and engineered an impressive export- and investment-led recovery. Bad luck for him that so many Hungarian voters felt the pain of reform without enjoying its benefits. 
Mr Orban, for his part, has yet to convince investors and free-market economists that he will manage to continue Mr Horn's reforms without, like Mr Horn, disappointing the people who elected him. Foreign investors are important: they have put more money per person in Hungary than anywhere else in post-communist Europe. They produce two-thirds of exports, the growing economy's motor. Share prices dropped over 17% after the first round of the election on May loth, though they were recovering towards the end of this week. 
But Mr Orban, 35 on May 31st, is nothing if not adaptable. He was prominent in Fidesz when it was, in effect, the student wing ofthe Free Democrats, the junior(and more liberal) member of the defeated coalition. Yet he turned Fidesz into a party with mass appeal by sounding anything but liS eral. His economic pronouncements are tinged with demagoguery: taxes and inflation will be lower, he promises; growth faster; welfare more generous. He also champions the ethnic Hungarians living outside Hungary in ways that unnerve Romania and Slovakia, where most of them live. And he has rattled the Eu: for the sake of those Hungarian cousins, he has said, Hungary should not join the Eu's borderless Schengen area until they are in it too. And all good Hungarians should, like him, have three children. 
Will he jettison such populism, once in office? Much will depend on his partners. So far, he has derided the prospect of a ""grand coalition"" with the defeated Socialists. That leaves him with the rural Smallholders, who can sound even more populist than Mr Orban.They want to restore the death penalty. They would ban the sale of land to foreigners, making it harder for Hungary to join the EU. 
But the Smallholders' rank and file may be easier-going than their irascible nationalist leader, Jozsef Torgyan. Finding him a job that makes him feel good while curbing his influence, especially over the economy, is Mr Orban's biggest problem. But Mr Torgyan, like Mr Orban, may become more pragmatic in office. He is already toning down his language. And both men have refused to co-operate with Istvan Csurka, an out-and-out chauvinist, whose Justice and Life Party has for the first time won seatsalbeit only a handful-in parliament. 
Mr Orban has promised to leave in office the central bank's president, Gyorgyi Suranyi, widely seen as a guarantor of economic stability. A newspaper close to Fidesz has tipped as the likely finance minister Laszlo Urban, an American-trained economist with fiscally conservative instincts. The first clue to the new government's economic approach, and to the Smallholders' influence, will be the drafting of next year's budget, which begins within months. 
So the change may not be that big after all. And that, perhaps, reveals a real trend in Central Europe. After nearly a decade of pain and populism, with the worst of the transition over, voters and parties may be converging on a steadier, less hectic, phase of post-communist reform-with Poles and Hungarians showing the way.

Events in Kosovo have brought the issue back into Hungary's headlines. 
Many refugees fleeing Vojvodina said that Serbs had been trying to bully them into joining the army. But the province's Magyars are on the whole much better integrated into Serbia than Kosovo's ethnic Albanians have been. Many have married Serbs. Nothing like the Kosovars' fate has befallen them.

Ten years ago, on June 16th of 1989, Mr Orban was content to share the speech-making honours with Imre Mecs at the reburial of Imre Nagy, the communist prime minister executed on that day in 1958, for leading Hungary's rebellion against the Russians two years before. Mr Mecs was a veteran of the uprising, which broke out seven years before Mr Orban was born. This year, on the same day, Mr Orban did not even invite Mr Mecs to mark the occasion. Why not? 
Because Mr Mecs is a leading member of the Alliance of Free Democrats, a centrist opposition party that the free-market Mr Orban viscerally dislikes. His government, which ousted its Socialist predecessor at the polls a year ago, made sure that it dominated this year's commemoration. In a stridently partisan speech, Tamas Deutsch, the minister for youth and sport, said that, with the Socialists out of power, a Hungarian government could again lay wreaths at Nagy's grave with a clear conscience. 
How different from the reburial ceremony ten years ago, when Nagy's remains were brought from an obscure municipal cemetery to Heroes' Square in the heart of Budapest. On that occasion, Mr Orban and his fellow dissidents allowed some communists to play a part. The uprising, which most Hungarians still call a ""revolution"", looked set to bind the country together. 
But history these days has been doing the opposite. Last November, MPS from Mr Orban's Fidesz-Hungarian Civic Party blocked a grant of $304,000 to the Institute for the History of 1956. Many of the institute's researchers were anti-Stalinist communists who were jailed, four decades ago, for joining the rebels. Like Mr Mecs, many of them are now Free Democrats, who think Mr Orban's lot have moved too far to the right. Whereas their institute's grant was cut to $29,000, some $487,000 was given instead to a new Institute for Twentieth-Century History, whose scholars are more to the new government's taste. 
An historian in charge of the new institute, Maria Schmidt, who has the prime minister's ear, says it is too early to say exactly what research it will do. But it looks set to air the views of those who hark back to the years between the two world wars, when conservatives ran Hungary. Former communists, whether or not they disavowed Stalin, should not write Hungary's history, says Ms Schmidt: it would be like letting old Nazis, repentant though they might be, write Germany's pre-war history. How, she asks, could they tell the truth about crimes in which they were themselves implicated? 
According to the 1956 institute's head, Janos Rainer, who was never a communist, Mr Orban's friends argue that the rising was purely nationalist, and that anti-Stalinist communists were irrelevant. Among other things, says Mr Rainer, that ignores the demands made by many of the leading antiSoviet rebels that the workers should control industry. 
Most of these battlers for their own historical truths are too young to have had direct experience of the year under scrutiny. Ms Schmidt was born three years before it; Mr Rainer, the year after; Mr Orban, in 1963. In any event, say the radicals of the right, Hungarians no longer need to grapple with history in muted tones. The time for building a post-communist consensus to heal old wounds has gone. No more shades of grey, in history as in politics. ","AS POLITICAL rivalries in Hungary heat up , some historians , egged on by Viktor Orban's , are adding fuel to the flames . Ten years ago , on June 16th of 1989 , Viktor Orban was content to share the speech - making honours with Imre Mecs at the reburial of Imre Nagy , the communist prime minister executed on that day in 1958 , for leading Hungary 's rebellion against the Russians two years before . Mr Mecs was a veteran of the uprising , which broke out seven years before Viktor Orban was born . This year , on the same day , Viktor Orban did not even invite Mr Mecs to mark the occasion . Why not ? 
 Because Mr Mecs is a leading member of the Alliance of Free Democrats , a centrist opposition party that Viktor Orban viscerally dislikes . Viktor Orban's government , which ousted its Socialist predecessor at the polls a year ago , made sure that it dominated this year 's commemoration . In a stridently partisan speech , Tamas Deutsch , the minister for youth and sport , said that , with the Socialists out of power , a Hungarian government could again lay wreaths at Nagy 's grave with a clear conscience . 
 How different from the reburial ceremony ten years ago , when Nagy 's remains were brought from an obscure municipal cemetery to Heroes ' Square in the heart of Budapest . On that occasion , Viktor Orban and Viktor Orban's fellow dissidents allowed some communists to play a part . The uprising , which most Hungarians still call a "" revolution "" , looked set to bind the country together . 
 But history these days has been doing the opposite . Last November , MPS from Viktor Orban's Fidesz - Hungarian Civic Party blocked a grant of $ 304,000 to the Institute for the History of 1956 . Many of the institute 's researchers were anti - Stalinist communists who were jailed , four decades ago , for joining the rebels . Like Mr Mecs , many of them are now Free Democrats , who think Viktor Orban's lot have moved too far to the right . Whereas their institute 's grant was cut to $ 29,000 , some $ 487,000 was given instead to a new Institute for Twentieth - Century History , whose scholars are more to the new government 's taste .

BUDAPEST 
WHEN Viktor Orban and his centre-- Wright Fidesz Party took charge of Hungary in July last year, some feared that the new government might slow down its Socialist-led predecessor's market reforms. The fears may yet be justified, but for an unexpected reason. The Fidesz dog has been increasingly wagged by its tail-its coalition partner, the agrarian, right-wing and populist Smallholders' Party. In recent months Smallholder-led ministries have overspent the agriculture budget, tried to ban all dairy imports, and nearly lost a large amount of money on offer from the European Union. 
Over many of these episodes looms the larger-than-life figure of the Smallholders' leader, Jozsef Torgyan. A former lawyer in his 6os, Mr Torgyan brings to the government an older type of Hungarian nationalist conservatism to challenge the more liberal inclinations of the Fidesz's youngsters, Young Mr Orban-he is 36-is being hobbled. 
Mr Torgyan, who fancies himself as Hungary's next president, can sometimes display an almost surreal detachment from reality. In July, he announced that his party would win the next general election, in 2002, even though its 6% rating in the opinion polls is a bare percentage point above the threshold for getting any seats in parliament at all. He has bizarrely claimed that Hungary's intellectuals were flocking to support the Smallholders because they disapproved of Fidesz's plan to remove agricultural colleges from the sway of Mr Torgyan's agriculture ministry. And when Fidesz wanted to transfer the country's state-run football clubs to a new (Fidesz-run) youth-and-sports ministry, Mr Torgyan replied that he ought to keep the honorary presidency of-and the right to subsidise-Ferencvaros, a popular club linked to the farm ministry. 
Farm-support spending tripled in the first three months of this year, and the agriculture ministry's budget of 124 billion forints ($513m) was all spent by the end of June. Mr Torgyan opposed next year's budget plan because his partners refused to let the agricultural part of it be more than trebled. He has now grudgingly accepted a mere doubling, though that is a lot more than the finance ministry said it could allow. Eyebrows also shot up in July when his ministry tried to ban all dairy-product imports, claiming that some had been found to be contaminated. A horrified economics minister got the ban lifted before it could take effect and breach Hungary's EU commitments. 
The Smallholders' curious behaviour does not end with Hungary's own money. The Eu's ambassador in Budapest, Michael Lake, recently assailed the government's handling of EU grants under the Phare programme of aid to ex-communist countries. The process, mostly run by Smallholders in the farm and environment ministries and the special Phare office, had been, he said, a near-catastrophe. Half the money provided in 1996's three-year programme was not allocated until this September, the last possible moment. Even with a last-minute rush, C8.8m ($9.2m) in free money was lost. 
Why does Mr Orban put up with all this? Partly, perhaps, because he and some of those around him quite like Mr Torgyan's version of ""compassionate conservatism"". Mr Orban has said that in 1995 the Socialists enforced their painful if largely successful austerity measures solely to show their advisers' familiarity with the ""latest fashionable economic theories"". He has fostered protests against insurance companies that refused to pay compensation to uninsured flood victims. He has also cheered on some Smallholders' dislike of the central bank's eminently solid governor, Gyorgy Suranyi, ostensibly for his alleged shortcomings in investigating losses at the bank's commercial subsidiary in Vienna. 
The true answer, however, may be simpler. Mr Orban needs the Smallholders to keep his government in office. The Smallholders are an uncommonly assertive little party. overspending and incompetence by its ministers may be the price that Fidesz pays to stay in power. ","Hungary

HUNGARY'S foreign ministry did issue, if a little late, a statement deploring some of Jorg Haider's views. But Hungary's prime minister, Viktor Orban, also made it plain that he was unpleasantly disturbed by the 14 EU countries' decision last week to put Austria's new government into some kind of diplomatic quarantine. The entry of Mr Haider's party into Austria's government was, he said with apparent approval, like ""a stone being thrown into an intellectually and politically stagnant pond"". 
What the Eu countries had done ""forces us all to think harder than usual about the deeper meaning of democracy,"" he said. indeed, though Hungary has been trying for several years to get itself into shape to join the EU, its prime minister said that Hungarians should now carefully ponder their country's future ties with it, implying clearly that there should be limits to future Eu encroachments on Hungarian sovereignty. Mr Orban pointedly did not condemn Mr Haider or his party. There was no need, he said, for Hungary tojoin a boycott. 
It is not the first time that Hungary's pugnacious, conservative prime minister has asserted Hungary's independence of EU thinking, He has previously insisted on starting negotiations for a trade agreement with Croatia, when that country was ostracised under its recently deceased leader, Franjo Tudjman. He also regularly complains about the slow pace at which the Eu is taking in new members from Central Europe. Hungary's economy, he says, is more advanced and more tied in with the EU than Spain's or Portugal's was when they got into the club 14 years ago. 
Apart from his own prickly suspicion that the EU is too keen to dictate to small countries, Mr Orban also has pragmatic reasons for being soft on the Haiderites. His own party, Fidesz, has had to cut the occasional parliamentary deal with the Hungarian justice and Life Party, an ultra-nationalist group that shares some of Mr Haider's nastier beliefs. And leading figures in the Smallholders' Party, a junior partner in Mr Orban's coalition, are also inclined to make fiercely xenophobic remarks from time to time. 
On top ofthat, Mr Orban cherishes Hungary's historic links with Austria, which long bound the two countries together at the heart of a great empire, And as the EU'S bridgehead into Central Europe, Austria, in Mr Orban's view, is far too important to annoy, whoever is running its government.

But Hungary's right-wing prime minister looks calm. Maybe his own Fidesz party, with an economic boom to help it, will do nicely in the general election, due in spring next year. 
The scandal first broke in October when Zoltan Szekely, then a Smallholders member of parliament, met a businessman called Daniel Balla, whose string of contracts to install municipal sewers, the MP had been suggesting, might get a parliamentary investigation. Instead, say prosecutors, Mr Szekely, sitting in Mr Balla's car, got a wad of money, some $70,000-worth. And more: it was a sting. Mr Balla had taped the conversation. As he stepped out of the car, 30-odd plain-clothes policemen swooped in. Mr Szekely is now in jail, awaiting trial on blackmail and other charges. 
The affair set off a wave of allegations against the Smallholders. Where had Jozsef Torgyan, the agriculture minister and party leader, found the money to build a fancy house in a Budapest suburb? Had he obeyed the rules on the disclosure of mps' assets? Mr Torgyan hit back, successfully insisting that parliament should investigate changes in all MPS' assets since 1990. But not all the allegations could be parried that way. The police started investigating a fund run by the environment ministry under a previous minister, also a Smallholder. Tales began to circulate that this ministry and the ministry of defence had channelled money to the Smallholders' party newspaper. 
The Smallholders still hold four cabinet posts. But, with Mr Torgyan now busy ousting from the party anyone who disagrees with his own, eccentric leadership, most people reckon the party is going under. That might not worry Mr Orban much: the ideologically nearest lifeboat for ex-Smallholder floating voters would bear the name Fidesz. 
Certainly, Fidesz has not helped its partner by agreeing this month to publish details of ministers' foreign travel in 1999. Cynics had long made fun of Mr Torgyan's frequent and lengthy visits to countries with few agricultural links to Hungary. It turns out that he spent nearly as many days abroad as the foreign minister. One trip was to Thailand. There too went Bela Szabadi, a junior agriculture minister, also a Smallholder, four times, on first-class tickets, in six months. Hungary's agricultural exports to Thailand totalled just $80,000 in 1999, down 29% on the year before. 
Conspiracy-theorists see other grounds for Mr Orban's unconcern. He barely needs Smallholder support. Late last year parliament passed a two-year budget which should hold good until after the next general election. Apart from legislation concerned with the European Union-on which nearly all parties agree-the government has little of importance to put through. 
What Mr Orban does need is support from the voters. That sounds odd. Spurred by austerity measures and privatisations introduced by the previous, Socialist-led government after a crisis in 1995, GDP grew last year by about 5.5%; industrial output may have risen more than 20%. Unemployment, less than 7%, though much higher in the country's poor east, is the lowest in Eastern Europe. Multinational companies are still coming in, albeit not as fast as a few years ago. With this to back it, the two-year budget promises bigger state pensions and better pay for public-sector workers. Spending on social services should rise. The minimum wage is already going up some 60%, if only to a sorry $140-odd a month. What more could voters want? 
Meanwhile, the opposition is in chaos. The ex-communist Socialists, whom Mr Orban's party ousted from power three years ago, are at loggerheads. Their urbane leader, Laszlo Kovacs, does not strike some comrades as the man to win an election. The liberal Free Democrats have not made much impact recently, though their recent choice of a new leader, Gabor Demszky, the popular mayor of Budapest, may help. 
And yet the opinion polls say that, of the voters who have made up their minds, only 33% at present intend to back Fidesz, against the Socialists' 49%. Still, Mr Orban has much to aim for: 45% of all potential voters say they have not made up their minds.

As finance and then prime minister, he ran a post-communist government for longer than any of the region's counterparts, bar Slovenia's. He achieved the rare feat of busting a country (Czechoslovakia) in two, and staying in charge of the better half. He has been as ardent as any of post-communism's free-marketeers, merrily accepting the label Thatcherite. More unusually for a Central European, he sounds more critical of the European Union than other mainstream politicians in the region. And though the pollsters say that most Czechs dislike the adversarial, arrogant, clever Mr Klaus, the pundits in Prague, his country's capital, think he still has a chance of getting back into power. 
Born nearly 60 years ago, he has always been contrarian. As a young economist (and international basketball player) who managed to see a bit of the West, studying for a stint in Italy and then in the United States, he went against the Marxist grain. Along with Vaclav Havel, now his country's president, he helped found Civic Forum, the group of dissidents who led the ""velvet revolution"" that ousted the communists in 1989. That year he became Czechoslavakia's finance minister, rising in 1992 to prime minister, a post he held (in the bigger and then, after the break-up in 1993, the smaller country) until 1997. 
In the early post-communist days, many Czechs found his bossy ways and the gusto with which he sold capitalism just about tolerable-so long as the new order produced the goods. Alas, the capitalism that emerged was too much of the crony kind. Mr Klaus was not accused of personal self-enrichment, but his regime was stained with corruption. Privatisation was bungled, to the benefit of too few. Mr Klaus was too soft on the spies who crowded round him. A splurge of scandals eventually brought his government down. 
How come, then, that he is still a force among Czechs, and may even come to influence EU politics? For one thing, he is not altogether out of power. After the last general election, he wangled a deal with the winning Social Democrats, led by Milos Zeman, who had failed to secure an outright majority in parliament. Mr Klaus's lot agreed to let Mr Zeman's run the show, provided that Mr Klaus became speaker, thereby entitling him to help set the legislative agenda. Now, as the Social Democrats begin to run out of steam, Mr Klaus and his core of friends, though still behind in the opinion polls, think they have a chance of getting back at the next election, due at the latest next year. Under the Czechs' electoral system, all sorts of party combinations are possible-and Mr Klaus is a ferociously adept deal-cutter. 
For another thing, he thinks his Eurosceptical tone may start winning votes. Not that he is out-and-out hostile to the EU. A selfstyled ""Euro-realist"", he wants the Czechs to join it-and thinks that, along with the Poles, Hungarians and others, they will. But the Czechs, he says, should be far more combative in negotiation. 
Mr Klaus lauds the Union as a free-trade area, and he believes workers should be free to move across borders. But he is full of bile against Brussels, especially its bureaucracy. Under its malign guidance, the bringing together of Europeans has, he complains, been ""non-genuine, non-spontaneous, non-evolutionary and therefore artificial"". Moreover, Czechs are right to be sensitive about their sovereignty, after centuries under the yoke of Habsburg Vienna and then of Moscow. Why, he asks, should ""business-class Eurocrats"" presume to lord it over ""economy-class Slavs""? Before joining the EU, he says, the Czechs should have a referendum on the matter. This twitchier attitude is beginning to strike a chord in both Poland and Hungary.Indeed, in Viktor Orban, Hungary's aggressively right-wing prime minister, Mr Klaus may have Central Europe's nearest thing to a soulmate. 
It is not certain that this Czech Gaullism, as Mr Klaus's credo has been called, will win votes. Polls suggest that two-thirds of Czechs are keen for their country, without much ado, to join the Eu. Besides, say his opponents, Mr Klaus's concern for the wishes of ordinary Czechs is a bit rich, coming from the man who presided over the Czechoslovakian break-up without first bothering to test public opinion. 
But Mr Klaus thinks the Union may, in any event, be going his way. He rather liked the outcome of the EU'S summit in December in Nice, where the club's present members agreed to changes to let the newcomers in. What was particularly good, says Mr Klaus, was that the nation-statists appeared to fend off the ""scheming federalists"" who would ""enforce an artificial unification of Europe"". While other aspirants complain about dates of entry, Mr Klaus is unworried: the sort of Europe being built is what counts. 
Mr Klaus's independent-minded nationalism manifests itself in other ways, too. He spoke out against the EU countries' diplomatic isolation of Austria after jorg Haider's farright party joined a coalition government last year. And though keen on the Czechs' new membership of NATO, he opposed the alliance's bombing of Serbia in 1999. 
At home, Mr Klaus's tendency to get caught up in rows and political shenanigans persists. Prague recently witnessed the biggest demonstrations since the velvet revolution, in protest against the appointment of a state television director said to be too matey with Mr Klaus. Most strikingly, Mr Klaus is at loggerheads with Mr Havel, once his ally against communism. Indeed, their mutual antipathy cuts to the heart of how a post-communist society-and how Europe in general-should evolve. 
Mr Klaus's flinty vision of independent states, co-operating but certainly not melding, runs against Mr Havel's consensual, welfare-conscious welcome of a cosier pan-European embrace. ""I don't believe what he says, what he stands for, what he does. I don't understand his civil society,"" says Mr Klaus of his president.

For they are Magyars, or ethnic-Hungarians, who come from parts of present- day Romania that fell within Hungary's borders until 1918, and are therefore among some 3m-4m would-be beneficiaries of a plan by the country's right-wing government, led by Viktor Orban, to boost the lot of ethnic-Hungarians across Central Europe. The government says it is merely seeking to do its duty to protect Magyars who live outside Hungary. Some in the opposition, however, say the plan is a nationalistic ploy by the right to win votes at Hungary's next general election, due in a year's time.
 Many Magyars, be they citizens of Romania or elsewhere, already depend on Hungary for business. They work illegally on Budapest's building sites. Many help bring in the harvest from Hungary's farms. Now, under the proposed new law, they would become eligible for education and health benefits, employment rights and a batch of other perks. Next year, says the government, special cards to confer such rights--though not the right to vote--would be issued. Many thousands of grateful Magyars, hopes Mr Orban, will claim them before the next general election.
 The law certainly touches a ticklish problem for Hungary as it strives to join the European Union. At present, all citizens of neighbouring countries that have notable minorities of Magyars-- Romania, with more than 1.6m of them, Slovakia, with 600,000, Yugoslavia, with 300,000, and Ukraine, with 200,000--can move freely in and out of Hungary. But once Hungary joins the EU, the citizens of several of these countries, though probably not Slovakia, may need visas.
 Zsolt Nemeth, a junior foreign minister whose father came from Transylvania, the western bit of Romania that now abuts Hungary, says that without the new law many thousands of desperate ethnic- Hungarians might surge into Hungary before it joined the EU. So the law would let ethnic-Hungarians work legally in Hungary for three months a year while helping them financially to sustain their way of life when back home. Three months' wages in booming Hungary, Mr Nemeth says, are enough to live on for a year in much poorer Ukraine or Transylvania. But the EU dislikes the proposed law, since it would sanction ethnic discrimination in the labour market between citizens of neighbouring countries.
 In any event, some Hungarian opposition MPs on the left and in the centre doubt whether the law would solve the Magyars' problems. Istvan Szent-Ivanyi, a former foreign minister who now heads parliament's foreign-affairs committee, says that Hungarian employers, who use foreign Magyars mainly as cheap labour, are unlikely to pay their tax and social-security contributions just because the new law would allow them to; and without such payments, Magyars would be unable to take advantage of Hungary's health service, except through a special fund whose largesse will be dished out by a committee likely to be packed with government nominees. Mr Szent-Ivanyi worries that the recipients would become part of a new kind of government clientele.
 For the most ardent nationalists, however, the bill is still too weak. For instance, Miklos Patrubany, the president of the World Federation of Hungarians, a radical ethnic-Hungarian lobby group, says that the EU should simply admit all 3m-4m Magyars who now live outside Hungary, on top of the 10m people already in the motherland: not a plan that EU countries are likely to look upon at all benignly.

 SO A king is back on his throne-or rather he is more or less in charge of his country without actually having a crown plonked on his head, at any rate not quite yet. That alone, in ex-communist Europe, is a remarkable first. The clear victory of the Simeon II National Movement in Sunday's general election in Bulgaria was an astonishing feat. Within a few months of the outfit's inception, it had swept past the ruling and reform-minded centre-right coalition of Ivan Kostov, dismissed the challenge of the barely reconstructed communists of the Bulgarian Socialist Party, assured just about everybody that it would seek a corruption-fighting consensus, and sailed to victory with no less than 43% of the votes and about half the seats in Bulgaria's parliament.
 Does this mean that a more steady sort of democracy, where kings and communists are both assigned to history's dustbin, has somehow failed to take root in post-communist Europe, and that populism, nostalgia and personality cults are the vogue? Not at all. For sure, it points up the fickleness of electorates in countries that have yet to recover from the double bashing of communism and its collapse. It suggests that quite a few voters can be swayed by politicians with thin records promising the earth. And it shows how hard it is for reforming governments to win re-election if they have inflicted necessarily harsh medicine on their voters, even though they may have set their country on the road towards a recovery that cannot be instant. But the record, across a swathe of ex-communist territory, from Estonia in the north down at least to Bulgaria in the south, suggests that democracy is well entrenched and that the wackier and nastier sorts of populists, with a few exceptions, have little support.
 Roughly speaking, the worse the economy, the bigger the chance of political upheaval and mayhem under mavericks: by that measure, Bulgaria risks being wobbly for quite a while. The ex-king's victory may yet turn out to be a populist protest that fails to lead to more solid reform. Bulgaria and Romania are certainly the economic laggards of ex-communist Europe outside the former Soviet Union, and excluding Albania and the war-ravaged bits of ex-Yugoslavia. So it would be odd if they were not, in politics, pretty unstable.
 Romania, in fact, is the least impressive of the pack, though it should, with 23m people and plenty of natural wealth, be one of Central Europe's leaders. Its economic reform has stalled again and again. It has re-elected as president an ex-communist, Ion Iliescu, who served at the elbow of one of the region's ghastliest dictators, Nicolae Ceausescu. And it has one of the strongest populist parties, in the shape of Vadim Tudor's Greater Romania party, a xenophobic lot who heap abuse on Gypsies and ethnic Hungarians. But even there multi- party democracy underpinned by fair elections looks secure.
 Bulgaria, though economically creaky and more corrupt than most other ex-communist countries, has done a bit better than Romania of late. Mr Kostov had earned plaudits from the European Union and the World Bank for plugging on with economic reform. But he had failed to better the lives of enough Bulgarians, nearly a fifth of whom have no jobs. Hence the thirst for something new (or, in the person of a 64- year-old king, something old).
 Simeon has some bright young men whom he has lured back from investment banks in London and elsewhere. He may well press on with most of Mr Kostov's policies, and perhaps be lucky enough to see some of them bear fruit ""within 800 days"", as he has boldly promised. But continuing to sell off rusting state assets could upset many of the workers who voted for him-by chucking them out of jobs. And his group includes some rum folk who may not prove much cleaner than some of Mr Kostov's lot.
 Nor is it yet clear what job the ex-king will have. He says he does not want the crown back. He may not choose to be prime minister. He will presumably pull a lot of the strings, whatever his title. In any event, the voters' delight may not last for all of those 800 days. Bulgaria is still not far off being a basket case.
 Cheer up, all the same
 But a pattern has emerged in the rest of post-communist Europe that is on the whole encouraging. Admittedly, most countries that were once part of the Soviet Union are not doing so well. Except, that is, for the three Baltic countries, which have managed to get out from under the Russian shadow. Estonia, in Finland's backyard, is now almost an honorary Nordic, while Lithuania, which lost a prime minister this week over a row about taxes and privatisation, has nudged closer to Poland. Exclude, too, the bloodier bits of the Balkans, though Slovenia has successfully debalkanised, resurrecting itself as a modern offshoot of Austria-Hungary. And once-wretched Albania has begun to bounce back from rock bottom, leaving ex-Soviet Moldova at the foot of the poverty league.
 Indeed, the economies of post-communist Central Europe, after sinking into degradation in the first five years or so after communism collapsed, are beginning to perk up; and their political systems are looking quite solid too. Nasty populists in Slovakia, in the shape of Vladimir Meciar and Robert Fico, are still getting too many votes. In Hungary Istvan Csurka's xenophobic Justice and Life Party may yet wield influence in a coalition (see article). And Romania's Mr Tudor still wins votes. But populists elsewhere have done pretty badly-witness the flop of populist ranters such as Poland's once-buoyant farmer, Andrzej Lepper, who took only 3% of the vote in the last general election.
 However, two of the biggest banes of post-communist Europe remain in place. One is corruption, which still weakens the framework of newly reintroduced capitalism. The other is the failure of pro- market reformers to persuade voters that future prosperity is worth the present pain. It was disgust at both of these defects that helped bring Bulgaria's ex-king to power.
 It is the inadequacies of the pro-market politicians that have been responsible for the fact that virtually no radically reforming government has won consecutive terms of office in ex-communist Europe. One arguable exception is the Czechs' Vaclav Klaus, less radical than he sounded, who was brought down by the sleaziness of his friends. Another is Janez Drnovsek, Slovenia's cautiously reforming prime minister, who lacks radical zeal but senses how fast his people would like to go. A near-exception is Estonia's Mart Laar, whose radical reformers were chucked out after their first zealous spell in office but came back (and are still there) after electoral humiliation and a soul-searching hiatus. A possible next mould- breaker? It could be Hungary's abrasive right-winger, Viktor Orban."," The ousting of one of ex-communist Europe's less bad governments by an ex-king (below) does not mean that the region's democracy is in peril

 HE'S young, slick with the media, anti-socialist, but is becoming ideologically more ambiguous: a more abrasive version of Tony Blair, say some Hungarians of Viktor Orban, their prime minister. Can he break Hungary's post-communist mould next spring by winning a second term in a row? Mr Orban's Fidesz party, seen by its foes as an arrogant young clique, has trailed behind the opposition Socialists for most of the years since the last election, in 1998.
 Yet win he may. The feuding Socialists, bypassing their party leader, Laszlo Kovacs, have picked a new challenger: Peter Medgyessy, finance minister in the later years of the Socialist-led coalition that ruled from 1994 to 1998, but not even a party member. His acceptance speech suggested more of the pro-market policy he pursued in office, with some nationalist touches to please the (ex- communist) Socialists' crustier wing. But can he end the bickering that has been undermining the left and persuade the last Socialist prime minister, Gyula Horn, to stop sniping at his own side?
 Fidesz, meanwhile, has drawn level in the polls. And it plays the nationalist card a lot more convincingly than the Socialists do. On June 4th, the 81st anniversary of the treaty that cost Hungary two- thirds of its area after the first world war, a government minister attended the consecration of a bell that will toll in daily lamentation. The government is also busy lobbying on behalf of ethnic Hungarians in the lost territories.
 And Mr Orban, Blair-like too, likes banging two drums at once. He proclaims support for entrepreneurs, yet urges party members to play up such Fidesz policies as dishing out credits for families, shoving up the minimum wage and abolishing university tuition fees.
 Much may depend, after the election, on the radical, nationalist Hungarian Justice and Life Party (MIEP) and its fiery leader, Istvan Csurka. Fidesz's current ally in government, the Independent Smallholders' Party, took 14% of the vote in 1998 but has been wrecked by corruption scandals. The centrist Alliance of Free Democrats and the conservative Democratic Forum are also both in poor shape. So the new parliament may contain only Fidesz, the Socialists and the arch-nationalists of MIEP.
 Mr Csurka might then emerge as as kingmaker. Would Mr Orban accept a coalition with such a populist? On this, he and his party blow hot and cold.","  That may depend on radical nationalists

 HE HELPED his country escape from Soviet captivity. But is he the man to bring it to the promised land? Hopes in Moscow, Washington and Brussels for Lithuania, the biggest but most backward of the three Baltic states, rest on the well-worn shoulders of the country's new prime minister, Algirdas Brazauskas.
 As the last leader of Lithuania's Communists, he prodded the evil empire towards collapse. The local party's spectacular breach with Moscow in 1989 crucially loosened the Kremlin's grip over its non- Russian empire. Less than two years later, the Soviet Union fell apart and Lithuania regained an independence that for half a century had seemed almost irretrievable.
 Now, as prime minister, his tasks are different. Instead of dodging the steel-teethed men in the Politburo, Mr Brazauskas must steer Lithuania towards the European Union and, with luck, into NATO too. The second matter is largely up to NATO: Lithuania is a bit better prepared than neighbouring Latvia or Estonia, but if the alliance wants any of them, it would probably want all three Baltic states together. The hope for EU membership, however, depends a lot on Mr Brazauskas and his government. Lithuania's delays, especially in making legal and administrative changes, are causing headaches in Brussels.
 The Baltic states' geography, which sandwiches them between rich Scandinavia and unpredictable Russia, makes them matter more than their population of 7.4m warrants. Ideally, all three should join together. If Lithuania (with 3.7m people) stays the slowcoach, it will be harder to bring in go-ahead Estonia or vulnerable Latvia, currently the main target of Kremlin ire.
 The root of the trouble is wasted time. In the 1990s, while Estonia rushed to privatise, reform and woo foreign investment, Lithuania fiddled, lurching between populism and inactivity. Corruption sprouted under governments of all stripes. Things began to go better in 1999, when, for a few months, a new government set about reform in earnest and balanced the books. But the next government, under a timid and indecisive Liberal prime minister, collapsed this summer, when the main leftist partners walked out and teamed up with Mr Brazauskas's lot.
 No one would call the new prime minister timid or indecisive. He exudes solidity, with the beefy self-assurance of a successful Soviet bureaucrat. Though some nationalists dislike his Communist past, most Lithuanians reckon he has amply proved both his patriotism and his democratic credentials. His Social Democrats are not simply rebranded ex-Communists. They followed his risky pro-independence path in 1989. A pro-Kremlin lot have long since vanished. For over a decade, Mr Brazauskas has usually topped Lithuania's popularity polls. Unlike many Lithuanian politicians, he is a good administrator.
 To the disappointment of some left-wingers, he shows no sign of bringing a big change of policy. Experienced ministers from the past stay on, at defence and foreign affairs. The new finance minister, Dalia Grybauskaite, is a formidable career civil servant. Breaking off from a hurried confab with her, Mr Brazauskas explains that the problem with the last government was not its general policies but the prime minister's personality. Won't people in the street be disappointed at the lack of changes? ""There are a lot of things that people in the street don't understand,"" says the former Communist Party boss breezily.
 Yet outsiders do have real worries. The biggest is about Lithuania's image abroad. Small countries have to fight for favourable attention; once won, it pays political and economic dividends. Mr Brazauskas knows the ropes: from 1993 to 1998 he was the country's president, a mainly ceremonial job. But he does not speak English. His bluff personal style owes more to the boozy, back- slapping atmosphere of the Soviet bureaucracy than the salon manners of international diplomacy. By contrast, other ex-Communist countries now have youngish, polyglot leaders such as Hungary's Viktor Orban or Estonia's Mart Laar to schmooze for them at international meetings. Worse still, Lithuania's current president, Valdas Adamkus, a returned emigre from America, is ill and out of touch.
 Another worry is the sheer burden of work to be done. The EU negotiations are hard, even for the most go-ahead Central and East European countries. Lithuania needs a huge amount of reform chiefly to speed up the economy and sort out the ponderous and at times corrupt bureaucracy. Mr Brazauskas does not seem the ideal man for that. And at 68 he looks knackered.
 Don't slip on the oil
 The third worry is balancing the business interests of Russian and western companies, especially in the energy industry. The country's biggest industrial plant (and biggest taxpayer), the Mazeikiai oil refinery, was crippled for years because Lukoil, a Russian company that controls its only supply pipeline, starved it of crude oil, hoping eventually to force out an American investor, Williams, and take it over. But now Williams, with the government's blessing, has teamed up with another big Russian oil company, Yukos, that seems to have made Lukoil release its grip on the pipeline.
 That deal, finalised by Mazeikiai's state and private shareholders this week, is a big plus for Mr Brazauskas. But Lithuania must do a lot better at separating politics from big business. The country's new tycoons--often with rich friends in Russia--seem to find it disturbingly easy to buy political influence. And Mr Brazauskas's own reputation as an impartial guardian of the national interest was hurt by an odd escapade early this summer when he flew to Moscow, while still an opposition politician, for secret talks about a gas deal, having first denied that he was planning anything of the sort. Just helping out friends, he says firmly. But will his old pals from Soviet days, now entrenched as owners of much of Lithuania's main industries, have too much clout, both with him and in politics in general?"," Lithuania's ex-Communist prime minister has plenty of capitalist work to do

 VIKTOR ORBAN, Hungary's prime minister, is young, right-of-centre and fiercely anti-communist. In many countries--including some in Central Europe--that would make him a keen disciple of the free market. Not, however, in Hungary. After one of post-communism's most successful economic-reform programmes, the government now seems to be heading in the opposite direction.
 Mr Orban was elected in 1998 on a wave of anger directed at the market-oriented austerity policies of his predecessors from, confusingly, the Socialist Party. Since coming to power he has never sounded like a market enthusiast, and some of his associates have sounded positively hostile towards foreign investors, who dominate Hungary's economy.
 Still, the prime minister did leave many of the economic foundations laid by the Socialists in place. Trusted free-marketeers were given important jobs. Zsigmond Jarai, a former head of the Budapest Stock Exchange, became finance minister, while Attila Chikan, an academic economist, became economics minister. Gyorgy Suranyi, the respected head of the independent central bank, kept his job.
 The prime minister was rewarded with economic growth that consistently ran at around 5% a year and a continuing healthy flow of investment from abroad. Yet nearly four years on only Mr Jarai remains in a senior position, now as head of the central bank. Mr Suranyi was refused a second term of office, and Mr Chikan sacked. With such restraining influences gone--and an election due next spring--Mr Orban's government has been sounding ever keener on a strong economic role for the state.
 Particularly painful for some companies--especially Mol, the mainly-private national oil-and-gas company--has been the policy of holding down state-controlled prices in order to curb inflation. Unable to raise prices for natural gas, of which it is a monopoly supplier, to world levels, Mol has suffered huge losses in its gas business. State ownership has also staged a comeback. The government has dropped plans to privatise Postabank, a bank nationalised in 1998 to prevent its collapse. Instead, it will team up with the state- owned post office and another state-owned bank to form a state-run banking and communications conglomerate. Similarly, some privately- run motorways have been nationalised, after their franchise-owners ran into trouble; new motorway-building is now financed by the state- owned Hungarian Development Bank. The cabinet, meanwhile, is now promising state largesse for such causes as spa tourism and Budapest's bid to stage the 2012 Olympics.
 Much of this spending is allocated under the government's Szechenyi plan, named after a 19th-century reformer. Advertised with sentimental posters about how Hungarians are daring to be great again, this development programme is presented, as are other economic policies, as part of a drive to restore Hungary's battered national pride.
 All of this is enough to worry many economists. But not enough to make them despair. Hungary's economy, they point out, is already as liberal as some West European ones. The state has little room for manoeuvre. Even such an apparently radical step as setting up a state- run banking group is unlikely to make much difference in an industry dominated by private, foreign institutions. The government may be accused of setting a poor example, but it is not, as yet, threatening Hungary's new-found economic health.

 THE Calvinist Church of the Homeland, on Budapest's Szabadsag Ter (Freedom Square), is liberally spattered with Hungarian nationalist symbols. Its pastor, Lorant Hegedus junior, is no typical clergyman either. He divides his time between his church and the seat he holds in parliament for the radical-nationalist Hungarian Justice and Life Party. And in September he wrote an article for a party newsletter that was widely interpreted as calling for Jews to be expelled from Hungary.
 The resultant furore, and Mr Hegedus's possible prosecution for inciting hatred, have exposed old tensions within the Hungarian Reform church, which claims the allegiance of almost a quarter of people in Hungary (and many ethnic Hungarians across the border in Romania). The church's ruling synod has denounced the article and banned active pastors from taking part in politics. That provoked the young pastor's most influential ally, his father, Lorant Hegedus senior, the reformed church's bishop of Budapest, to walk out. Long a fierce opponent of what he believes are closet communists within the church, the bishop fumed that the synod's behaviour had been ""dictatorial"".
 He is not alone. Prominent theologians issued an unusually forceful counter-blast to the younger Mr Hegedus's views when the controversy first broke. But since the synod's ban on political activity, ten pastors have said they would sooner remain on the Justice and Life Party's list of candidates for the election due next spring than continue in their religious posts.
 Bishop Gusztav Bolcskei, the church's presiding bishop, insists heroically that it is not split. The problem, he says, is a few people in Budapest--not a stronghold of his church, which is much more influential in the country's east. Yet the church plainly holds a place in the hearts of Hungary's radical nationalist right. It flourished in 17th-century Transylvania (today mostly Romanian, but the fringe of what was then an autonomous principality is within Hungary), and it was long a bastion of feeling against Austrian Habsburg rule.
 For some of its faithful, in the 20th century that tradition metamorphosed into a fierce anti-communist nationalism, combined with a dislike of Jews. Add the bitterness between those who felt oppressed by Soviet-imposed communist rule and those who chose collaboration, and a row one day was inevitable.
 The row has had political echoes too. To Justice and Life's leader, Istvan Csurka--a Calvinist himself--the church is the true voice of ""Hungarian"" religion, a historic repository of national feeling, and he welcomes its role in the party. But some of his parliamentarians feel it has too much influence there, and see in Mr Hegedus's over-the-top views a way to make that point.
 Not that the Calvinist church is the only one caught up in politics. Others, notably the Roman Catholic one, dominant in Hungary, are being wooed before the general election by right and left alike. The centre-right government of Viktor Orban, which would love a pre-electoral seal of conservative approval from them, has introduced new religious holidays and promised new state money for churches.

 IN THE past few months Hungary's bouncy, footballing, 38-year- old, conservative prime minister has managed to annoy just about everyone--except, perhaps, a majority of his own voters, who next month may conceivably buck the post-communist trend in Central Europe by granting him a rare second term in office on the trot. Among those who do not love Viktor Orban are a clutch of leaders of Hungary's neighbours. He has also been creating jitters in Brussels and elsewhere in the EU with his breezy nationalism. Less surprisingly, he continues to enrage Hungary's Socialist opposition, as well as the liberals and many of Budapest's intelligentsia and press, with his ruthless pragmatism mixed with ideological zeal, which they all decry as inimical to Hungary's unschooled democracy and against the spirit of pluralism and fair play. Across the board, he is often portrayed as clever, tricky, populist--perhaps even a little bit dangerous.
 The Romanians have been rattled by Mr Orban's ""status law"", which offers special perks to 2.5m ethnic Hungarians in Romania (and to 2.5m in other countries nearby), so conjuring up, for some, the spectre of irredentism: before 1920, Transylvania, now in western Romania, belonged to Hungary. The Slovaks are no less incensed by the same law as it applies to their ethnic Hungarians. And the Czechs are narked because Mr Orban has implied that the decrees whereby ethnic Germans and Hungarians were expelled from Czechoslovakia and had their property taken after the second world war may need revocation. The Czechs' leading conservative, Vaclav Klaus, grimly ponders the prospect of a ""Berlin-Vienna-Budapest axis"" against Prague.
 Mr Orban does not seem to mind much. In any event, he is far from friendless abroad. He has a soul-mate in Edmund Stoiber, the Bavarian conservative bidding to be Germany's chancellor. The Hungarian and Italy's prime minister, Silvio Berlusconi, are pals. Austria's ruling conservatives were delighted by Mr Orban's denunciation of the other EU countries' efforts to ostracise them for taking Jorg Haider's lot into their coalition two years ago. Conservatives across the continent enjoy Mr Orban's keenness to poke ex-communists, however repentant, in the eye.
 And at home he has much to purr about. True, it was the (ex- communist) Socialists, eager converts to the market, who put the economy on track between 1994 and 1998. But under Mr Orban it has grown faster, on average by 5% a year; unemployment has dipped from 9% to less than 6%, inflation from 16% to less than 7%. Real wages have shot up by more than 17% in four years, the minimum wage by 72% in real terms since 1999. Hungary, with 10m people, has Central Europe's perkiest economy.
 Mr Orban wants his Young Democrats' Alliance (known by its acronym Fidesz) to be an essentially bourgeois party based on Hungary's burgeoning new middle class, supported by small farmers, provincial folk and the church. He disparages ""the liberal Budapest elite"". Like Mr Stoiber, he is no fully fledged liberal, in economics or social affairs. He lauds competitition in business but likes government, especially his own, to interfere quite a lot. He is more protectionist (""patriotic"" is the word his party prefers) than his Socialist rivals, far more so than the struggling Free Democrats, Hungary's purest liberals, who would team up with the Socialists if the left won the election. He is wary of letting foreigners buy land, and gives warning against multinational and foreign domination. He wants Hungary to build up its economic muscle through small and medium-sized family-owned companies and wants to help half a dozen or so Hungarian-owned heavyweights to emerge on the global stage.
 But it is Mr Orban's nationalism--a dirty word for many Central Europeans, not so pejorative in France and Britain--that makes so many people, in and beyond Hungary, twitch. Hence that bad feeling over the status law. For some it raises the Central European ghosts of the past century, when borders and peoples were so bloodily messed about. Mr Orban talks merrily of the ""spiritual and cultural reunification of the Hungarian people"", including the 5m in Romania, Slovakia and elsewhere in the region. Transylvania, he says, is ""part of Hungary's living space in the Carpathian Basin"", adding jauntily that once the countries in the area embrace within the EU, then ""borders [will] have no importance"". The Brussels worriers have been discomfited, too, by Mr Orban's apparent decision to enact the status law before discussing it with his neighbours: an ""unEuropean"" way of behaving. And they are edgy about Mr Orban's refusal, in the event of a hung parliament, to rule out governing with the support of the anti- Semites of Istvan Csurka's far-right Justice and Life Party. Many of Hungary's 100,000 or so Jews, the largest such community in Central Europe, sound nervous.
 Nationalism isn't always malevolent
 Worries over the status law, which the Socialists voted for too, may, however, be overblown. Mr Orban felt obliged to calm Romania by offering all its people the three-month work permits that their ethnic-Hungarian compatriots can have in Hungary. Besides, most EU countries give perks (starting with Germany's acceptance of ethnic- German immigrants) on the basis of blood. The Slovaks have their own status law. Moreover, Hungary was unique in Central Europe in losing two-thirds of its land and one-third of its people after that endlessly reviled Treaty of Trianon of 1920. Why should it not seek, if not to redraw borders, at least to reconnect its brethren, squashed as they have been for centuries between German-speakers and Slavs?
 Mr Orban may be an awkward neighbour and a rough opponent. He may prove a tricky European. But he is an able leader of a new breed of Central Europeans for whom joining the EU is mainly a matter of self- interest; ""ever closer union"" in politics is not their ideal. Brussels bigwigs are rightly warier of telling such people what to do. They may even suck their teeth and shut their eyes if horrid Mr Csurka helps keep Mr Orban in power.","  Can the European Union cope with Central Europe 's abrasive new nationalists ? 
  IN THE past few months Viktor Orban's has managed to annoy just about everyone -- except , perhaps , a majority of Viktor Orban's own voters , who next month may conceivably buck the post - communist trend in Central Europe by granting Viktor Orban a rare second term in office on the trot . Among those who do not love Viktor Orban are a clutch of leaders of Hungary 's neighbours . Viktor Orban has also been creating jitters in Brussels and elsewhere in the EU with Viktor Orban's breezy nationalism . Less surprisingly , Viktor Orban continues to enrage Hungary 's Socialist opposition , as well as the liberals and many of Budapest 's intelligentsia and press , with Viktor Orban's ruthless pragmatism mixed with ideological zeal , which they all decry as inimical to Hungary 's unschooled democracy and against the spirit of pluralism and fair play . Across the board , Viktor Orban is often portrayed as clever , tricky , populist -- perhaps even a little bit dangerous . 
  The Romanians have been rattled by Viktor Orban's "" status law "" , which offers special perks to 2.5 m ethnic Hungarians in Romania ( and to 2.5 m in other countries nearby ) , so conjuring up , for some , the spectre of irredentism : before 1920 , Transylvania , now in western Romania , belonged to Hungary . The Slovaks are no less incensed by the same law as it applies to their ethnic Hungarians . And the Czechs are narked because Viktor Orban has implied that the decrees whereby ethnic Germans and Hungarians were expelled from Czechoslovakia and had their property taken after the second world war may need revocation . The Czechs ' leading conservative , Vaclav Klaus , grimly ponders the prospect of a "" Berlin - Vienna - Budapest axis "" against Prague .

 THEY sounded desperate, and maybe were, but they were right. In the days before the first round of Hungary's parliamentary elections on April 7th, the ex-communist Socialist Party insisted that the opinion polls were wrong. The polls showed Fidesz, the conservative party of the prime minister, Viktor Orban, at least four points-- some said 11--in the lead. Tosh, said the Socialists: the nastiness of the campaign was simply preventing their supporters from declaring themselves.
 Unconcerned, Mr Orban urged his supporters to turn out: this first round could win it for him, he said. It allocates seats in those of the 176 individual constituencies where a candidate wins over 50%. It also decides some of the 210 regional and party-list seats. It duly did--and as voting day closed, the Socialists, in a record turnout of 70%, were ahead. They took 42% of the party-list votes, against 41% for Fidesz, 25 constituency seats against 20, and 69 regional-list seats against Fidesz's 67.
 Fidesz's position is worse than it looks. In 1998, it was behind in the first round. But Mr Orban could turn for help to a number of allies, including the agrarian Smallholders' Party and the conservative Hungarian Democratic Forum. The three parties withdrew various candidates in the second round to make way for each other, securing a centre-right majority. But since then Mr Orban has been busy uniting the right, and this time there are few Smallholders and no Democratic Forum to turn to. The Smallholders collapsed last year amid corruption scandals, and this time took less than 1% of the vote. The Democratic Forum had been absorbed into a joint election list with Fidesz. And Mr Orban's only other hope, the nationalist Hungarian Justice and Life Party, narrowly fell short of the 5% needed to get any seats at all.
 The Socialists and their would-be prime minister, Peter Medgyessy, are better placed than it looks. They lead in 75 of the 131 seats to be decided in the second round, on April 21st. And they are on good terms with the liberal Free Democrats, who took third place in 103 constituencies. The two parties on Wednesday agreed not to fight each other on April 21st: the liberals will withdraw 71 candidates, the Socialists seven. The two are likely to form a coalition after the election, as in 1994.
 The game is not yet up for Mr Orban. Characteristically, he came out fighting on Tuesday evening. Pointing to a sharp rise in the Budapest stock exchange following his party's setback, he said it showed Hungary would be dominated by foreign capital if the Socialists won. The 1994-98 Socialist-led government was indeed more free-market-minded than his has been.
 But it will be an uphill struggle for him, thanks partly to errors of his own. For much of his time in office, Mr Orban has fought the liberal mayor of Budapest and appeared to have a grudge against the city. Its voters, nearly a fifth of the electorate, turned out to vote in even higher numbers than elsewhere. And only 32% voted his way, against 42% for the Socialists.","  Behind in the first - round ballot , the ruling party looks set to lose

 France suffered a political earthquake in the first round of the presidential election: standing on a law-and-order and anti- immigrant platform, Jean-Marie Le Pen, leader of the populist National Front, took almost 17% of the vote and came second to the centre-right's Jacques Chirac. That drove the Socialist Lionel Jospin out of the race. While its leaders pledged support to Mr Chirac, the left raged in impotent street demos, French-resident Arabs shivered and most of Europe expressed horror. One near- certainty: re-election for Mr Chirac.
 Germany's Social Democrats, expecting bad defeat in a state election in Saxony-Anhalt, suffered worse: total rout. Triumphant Christian Democrats saw a big boost to their hopes of being elected to national power in September. Meanwhile, members of the giant IG Metall union voted on whether to strike over pay.
 Italy's prime minister, Silvio Berlusconi, set off yet another quarrel over whether his power is excessive by denouncing two television journalists (and one comedian) for their ""criminal"" use of public television during last year's election campaign.

 Israel delayed the departure to Jenin of a UN fact-finding team, led by Martti Ahtisaari, a former Finnish president, insisting that it contain more military and counter-terrorist experts.
 Israel and the Palestinians held talks to try to end the stand- off at Bethlehem where about 300 people have been under siege in the Church of the Nativity for the past three weeks. Palestinian deaths included an assassinated Fatah leader, three 14-year-old suicide attackers killed near a Gaza settlement and four suspected collaborators publicly executed by Fatah militiamen.
 Protests at Israel's invasion of the West Bank continued in the Arab world. Egypt's Hosni Mubarak said that Israel's ""state terrorism"" would fuel an appetite for revenge. Jordan arrested five members of an outlawed Islamist party that had been pressing for Jordanian troops to be sent to help the Palestinians. Saudi Arabia's Crown Prince Abdullah was due to meet President George Bush in Texas on Thursday.
 A week after South Africa's cabinet said it favoured, after all, giving anti-AIDS drugs to rape victims and infected pregnant women, President Thabo Mbeki gave an uncharacteristically blunt speech about sex. He said that people who are ""having hugely promiscuous sex all over the place"" must expect to be affected by the disease.
 Mark Shuttleworth, an entrepreneur from Cape Town who sold his software firm at the right time, became the first African in space after paying $20m to the Russian space programme for the trip.

 In Rwanda, the police announced that a former president, Pasteur Bizimungu, will face trial for ""threatening state security"", by continuing to lead a banned opposition party.
 No minister
 Argentina's economy minister, Jorge Remes Lenicov, resigned after the country's Congress prevaricated over approving a plan to turn bank savings into bonds. His resignation calls into question the future of Eduardo Duhalde's four-month-old government, and a still elusive agreement between Argentina and the IMF.
 Colombia's FARC guerrillas abducted a departmental governor and a former defence minister from a peace march. An American congressional committee reported that the IRA had provided terrorist training to the FARC since at least 1998. Gerry Adams, leader of Sinn Fein, the IRA's political wing, declined to appear before the congressional committee.
 Catholic guilt
 Twelve American cardinals went to Rome to discuss with the pope the sexual-abuse scandal that is sweeping the Catholic church in America. They agreed that sexual infractions had no place in the priesthood and pondered whether erring priests should be defrocked after one offence. The pope refused to consider any change to the church's rule on celibacy.
 Karen Hughes, the White House counsellor and one of the chief guardians of the ""leak-proof"" Bush administration, resigned, saying she and her family were homesick for Texas.

 In a fresh show of power, Maoists ordered a general strike in Nepal. More than 3,500 people have died in the six-year rebellion against the constitutional monarchy.
 Razali Ismail, a United Nations envoy in Myanmar, was said to be ""cautiously optimistic"" that the ruling military junta would free Aung San Suu Kyi, the opposition leader, from house arrest.
 In continuing clashes between Hindus and Muslims in India's Gujarat state, 33 people were killed over three days. More than 850 people, mostly Muslims, have died in the country's worst religious violence in a decade.","  Politics 
  France suffered a political earthquake in the first round of the presidential election : standing on a law - and - order and anti- immigrant platform , Jean - Marie Le Pen , leader of the populist National Front , took almost 17 % of the vote and came second to the centre - right 's Jacques Chirac . That drove the Socialist Lionel Jospin out of the race . While its leaders pledged support to Mr Chirac , the left raged in impotent street demos , French - resident Arabs shivered and most of Europe expressed horror . One near- certainty : re - election for Mr Chirac . 
  Germany 's Social Democrats , expecting bad defeat in a state election in Saxony - Anhalt , suffered worse : total rout . Triumphant Christian Democrats saw a big boost to their hopes of being elected to national power in September . Meanwhile , members of the giant IG Metall union voted on whether to strike over pay . 
  Italy 's prime minister , Silvio Berlusconi , set off yet another quarrel over whether his power is excessive by denouncing two television journalists ( and one comedian ) for their "" criminal "" use of public television during last year 's election campaign . 
  In Russia , an argument rattled on between the Orthodox and Roman Catholic churches after two prominent Catholics , both long - time residents and one of them a bishop , had their visas cancelled . 
  Hungary 's ex - communist Socialists , led by Peter Medgyessy , looked set to form a coalition government , though Viktor Orban and Viktor Orban's conservative Fidesz party won most seats in a general election . 
  Ireland 's parliament was dissolved , with a general election called for May 17th . 
  After the facts 
  Israel delayed the departure to Jenin of a UN fact - finding team , led by Martti Ahtisaari , a former Finnish president , insisting that it contain more military and counter - terrorist experts . 
  Israel and the Palestinians held talks to try to end the stand- off at Bethlehem where about 300 people have been under siege in the Church of the Nativity for the past three weeks . Palestinian deaths included an assassinated Fatah leader , three 14 - year - old suicide attackers killed near a Gaza settlement and four suspected collaborators publicly executed by Fatah militiamen . 
  Protests at Israel 's invasion of the West Bank continued in the Arab world . Egypt 's Hosni Mubarak said that Israel 's "" state terrorism "" would fuel an appetite for revenge . Jordan arrested five members of an outlawed Islamist party that had been pressing for Jordanian troops to be sent to help the Palestinians . Saudi Arabia 's Crown Prince Abdullah was due to meet President George Bush in Texas on Thursday . 
  A week after South Africa 's cabinet said it favoured , after all , giving anti - AIDS drugs to rape victims and infected pregnant women , President Thabo Mbeki gave an uncharacteristically blunt speech about sex . He said that people who are "" having hugely promiscuous sex all over the place "" must expect to be affected by the disease . 
  Mark Shuttleworth , an entrepreneur from Cape Town who sold his software firm at the right time , became the first African in space after paying $ 20 m to the Russian space programme for the trip . He is the second "" space tourist "" , after a similar jaunt by Dennis Tito , a Californian financier , last year . 
  The World Food Programme gave warning that millions of people in Malawi , Zambia and Zimbabwe were about to be seriously short of food . 
  In Rwanda , the police announced that a former president , Pasteur Bizimungu , will face trial for "" threatening state security "" , by continuing to lead a banned opposition party . 
  No minister 
  Argentina 's economy minister , Jorge Remes Lenicov , resigned after the country 's Congress prevaricated over approving a plan to turn bank savings into bonds . His resignation calls into question the future of Eduardo Duhalde 's four - month - old government , and a still elusive agreement between Argentina and the IMF . 
  Colombia 's FARC guerrillas abducted a departmental governor and a former defence minister from a peace march . An American congressional committee reported that the IRA had provided terrorist training to the FARC since at least 1998 . Gerry Adams , leader of Sinn Fein , the IRA 's political wing , declined to appear before the congressional committee . 
  Catholic guilt 
  Twelve American cardinals went to Rome to discuss with the pope the sexual - abuse scandal that is sweeping the Catholic church in America . They agreed that sexual infractions had no place in the priesthood and pondered whether erring priests should be defrocked after one offence . The pope refused to consider any change to the church 's rule on celibacy . 
  Karen Hughes , the White House counsellor and one of the chief guardians of the "" leak - proof "" Bush administration , resigned , saying she and her family were homesick for Texas . 
  In the largest pro - Palestinian rally in America 's history , about 75,000 people marched through Washington , DC .

 IT LOST, but, even in losing, Fidesz, the conservative party of Hungary's prime minister, Viktor Orban, proved that in Central Europe too nationalist populism pays.
 Before the first round of the elections, on April 7th, the then opposition Socialists said polls were understating their support. Albeit narrowly, a surprise success proved them right: they got more votes than Fidesz, and won more of those seats decided in that round. Before the second one, on April 21st, Fidesz in turn insisted it could bring out enough extra voters to turn the overall result around. Since turnout in the first round had been a record 71%, and details of the figures looked unfavourable, that sounded even more unlikely. Yet turnout on the 21st was 73.5%, and Fidesz managed to end with 189 seats, only five short of a majority in the 386-seat parliament.
 How was it done? In the first round, the voters seemed to have rejected extremism. The Socialists, despite their unpleasant Communist heritage, are now quite like modern European social democrats. Fidesz is to the right of most centre-right parties. And the radical nationalist Hungarian Justice and Life Party did not reach the 5% needed to get any seats at all. So did Fidesz, between the rounds, aim for the centre?
 No, it became more populist and nationalistic. It held big, flag- waving rallies--one attracted several hundred thousand people--and told them that the free-market-minded Socialists would hand Hungary over to big business and (this for the farmers) let foreigners buy their land.
 The result revealed a divided country. The well-off west--well- off, ironically, thanks to foreign investment--favoured Fidesz. The poorer and less populous east mainly voted Socialist. Budapest, home to a fifth of the population, gave Fidesz only four of the city's 32 individual constituencies, and those by narrow margins.
 Peter Medgyessy, the Socialists' prime-ministerial candidate, a former finance minister with experience as an economist and banker, will depend on the support of the liberal Free Democrats, the only other party to have passed the 5% threshold. The two parties co- operated between the first round and the second, to maximise their seats, and on April 22nd began talks on a coalition, as in 1994-98.
 Even before the second round, the two parties were talking about healing the nation's divisions. They may manage a bit of that in parliament. Fidesz's electoral list included a second party, the Hungarian Democratic Forum. This latter, more like a typical Christian Democrat party, had shared in power, but in opposition its now 24 members may break away and be readier to ease the new government's path.
 Even so, Hungary looks set for four years of a government with a majority of only eight. And Fidesz will harry Mr Medgyessy-- especially if, as some Socialists have promised, the new government investigates corruption under the old one.

 A NEW slogan has appeared on walls in Budapest since Viktor Orban's conservative party, Fidesz, lost Hungary's general elections on April 21st: Csaltak (They cheated). It marks a remarkable change in Hungarian politics: Mr Orban is turning the right into a mass movement.
 The graffito reflects one of its basic premises: that the right lost the elections because the Socialists and Free Democrats, then in opposition, rigged them. Just how is unclear: electoral fraud is usually the prerogative of governments. No matter, Mr Orban, unabashed, is backing a referendum initiative aimed at preserving ballot papers so that they can be recounted. Not that he doubts the government's legitimacy, he says carefully; it is simply that, with the margins so narrow, the people should know the truth about the figures.
 Having launched his swing to populism as soon as it became clear he had lost the first round of voting, on April 7th, he has kept the momentum going. He promises to hold regular mass rallies of a new, multi-party, right-wing movement, which he is calling Hajra, Magyarorszag! (Forward, Hungary!), a deliberate echo of Forza Italia! (Go, Italy!), the football cheer that Silvio Berlusconi picked for the name of his political party, which now runs Italy. Mr Orban drew a huge crowd to Buda's castle district on May 7th for a rally where he announced the formation of what he called ""civic circles"", a bit like communist cells of old, to enable his supporters to mobilise at short notice.
 How different from the Socialist Party and its Free Democrat colleagues, now in office under Peter Medgyessy, a far less colourful figure, since May 27th. Mr Orban's team was full of zealots; his rival's is full of technicians, many of them former communists, with little political savvy. Mr Medgyessy was deputy prime minister in the 1988-89 transitional government and finance minister for part of the 1994-98 Socialist-led one, but he is a banker by profession, not a politician. He is still not a member of the Socialist Party.
 His response to Mr Orban's populism has been to set new rules to ensure greater accountability. The Socialists have also started airing allegations of crookery under the previous regime, including the controversial sale of 12 state farms and some fat government publicity contracts won by a company close to Fidesz.
 But blame-casting will not clear up public finance. Thanks to a pre- and post-election spending spree by Mr Orban's government, the budget deficit hit four-fifths of the projected figure for all of this year by the end of May. To match Fidesz's propaganda, the Socialists themselves pledged $750m in new spending in their first 100 days. The finance ministry, under Csaba Laszlo, once a civil servant there, says it can find the money. But there may well (and should) be hard choices to be made between Mr Medgyessy's promises and both men's prudent instincts.","  Voted out of power , the right accuses the left of rigging the election .

AN OFTEN-MENTIONED fault of Peter Medgyessy, Hungary's new prime minister, was that he was boring. No longer. This week, he was pushed to the brink of resignation after being forced to admit that he had worked for five years as an agent of Hungary's communist-era counter-intelligence service. Even in Hungary's turbulent history, it would have been a brief stint at the top. Mr Medgyessy, an economist and former banker, took office only on May 27th.
The news about his past particularly rattled the Free Democrats, a small liberal party which governs in coalition with his Socialists. As former dissidents, most of the Free Democrats' MPs have bleak memories of the various intelligence services. They were very unhappy to have the prime minister's past suddenly aired in front-page articles in Magyar Nemzet, a right-wing newspaper close to Viktor Orban's recently-ousted centre-right government. The new government relies on the Free Democrats' 20 votes for its 10-seat majority.
At least for the moment, nevertheless, the prime minister has slipped off the hook. He started his bid for survival by throwing the Free Democrats something they have long wanted by proposing a new law to ensure that counter-intelligence-agency files will be treated in the same way as other Hungarian communist-era secret-police files. They will be kept separately, in the Institute of History, and not left in the hands of the existing intelligence services. The institute will, in theory, be more open about revealing politicians' pasts. 
Mr Medgyessy denied some of the allegations against him while seeking to put those he admitted in a less ugly light. Certainly, he said, he had worked as a counter-intelligence agent in Hungary's finance ministry from 1977 to 1982. But he had merely protected Hungary's economic secrets from foreign spies and prevented them from spiking Hungary's attempts to join the IMF. Patriotic stuff, really. The countries trying to steal Hungary's economic secrets in those days, his friends explained, would have been other communist countries, such as East Germany. The Russians wanted to stop Hungary from joining the IMF, though it did so in 1982. 
The prime minister fiercely denies, however, that he did anything worse. He has said he will sue Magyar Nemzet over stories suggesting he wrote sneaky reports for the intelligence services on his friends in 1961 and on ""counter-revolutionary activities"" in 1978. The documents behind these stories, he says, are forgeries. His political survival may depend on that being true. In any case, it was a pity he did not come clean before he entered post-communist public life. Traitor, sneered the right-wingers he only recently defeated.

YOU won't usually find many Hungarian politicians in the capital in August. You will this year, thanks to two parliamentary investigations set afoot after it was revealed in June that Peter Medgyessy, prime minister in the Socialist-led government that won power in April's elections, was once a communist-era counterintelligence agent. The results are surprising.
One committee is looking at Mr Medgyessy's record; another at secret files that may reveal which other post-communist ministers had similar links. Unexpectedly, Mr Medgyessy and his team are emerging from the hearings pretty well. But for the centre-right opposition, notably Fidesz, the party of Viktor Orban, prime minister till April, they have been a body-blow. 
Mr Medgyessy acted as an agent while working at the finance ministry in 1978-82. But he has stuck to his line that all he did was protect economic secrets and prevent the Soviet KGB from disrupting Hungary's application to join the IMF, which he was helping to prepare. Though some still doubt it, his story has not so far been seriously undermined. But this week Imre Mecs, the--pro-government--member of parliament leading the other investigation, said that, on the figures so far, fewer ministers in the two Socialist-led post-communist governments had past secret-service links (two and one, respectively, though it is unclear whether this includes Mr Medgyessy himself) than in the two conservative ones (five and four).
Conservative ministers may also have done nastier things than those held against Mr Medgyessy. Some--if leaks to the press are true--may have had links with the domestic intelligence agencies, snooping on neighbours and colleagues.
The probable explanation is that the left-leaning governments have included many former communist ministers or party officials--recipients, not writers, of the spooks' reports--plus a few ex-dissidents, likelier victims (by and large) than agents of the secret police. But among conservative ministers, a fair number in communist days were middle-ranking public servants; the sort of people whose help the spooks would hope to recruit. 
The conservatives' response has not helped them. Their members on Mr Mecs's committee have walked out, talking of procedural irregularities. When the data-protection ombudsman ruled that no one should have data about him revealed without his consent, current ministers and those of the leftish government of 1994-98 rushed to give it. Ex-members of the conservative one of 1990-94 or Mr Orban's of 1998-2002 were slower. 
Opinion polls suggest that Fidesz and the right have been hurt. Voters already knew that Mr Medgyessy was on the ruling party's central committee in communism's later days. But Mr Orban had portrayed his team as firmly anti-communist. To many, that now smells of hypocrisy.

PAINFUL history is not hard to find in Central Europe. World wars, totalitarianism and genocide have been played out on its soil. Yet think also of Poland, which vanished from the map for more than a century. It re-emerged amid the ruins of the first world war only to be brutalised again during the second, then waited until 1989 for the freedom, once again, to make its own way. Stubbornly, this part of the world has a knack of rising again. Soon, thanks to Ireland's approval last weekend of the Nice treaty, its next reincarnation will appear.
In December, the European Union is due to finish negotiations with ten hopeful members which, save Cyprus and Malta, were all former satellite states of the Soviet Union. Poland, Hungary, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Slovenia and the three Baltic states will--perhaps by 2004--at last take their places as full members of Europe's top club. History, you might say, is coming to a happy end.
Eastern Europe was mostly a conceit of the cold war, based on Stalin's lumping together of everything to the east of the Iron Curtain. But Central Europe, the name now preferred by many locals, is itself rather new, having come into use only about a century ago. And it, too, conceals huge differences. Despite fitful attempts to progress, Bulgaria and Romania remain, like Ukraine, firmly in the East. By contrast, Slovenia looks little different from rich neighbour Austria, and is essentially western. The Baltics are tiny; besides, Estonia is practically Nordic in all but income. That leaves a Central Europe of Poland, the Czech Republic, Hungary and Slovakia, which now make up the first tranche of Europe's eastward enlargement.
In many ways, these four have already come most of the way home. Three of them--Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic--joined NATO in 1999. The Slovaks will probably do so after the NATO summit in Prague this November. Unlike their eastern neighbours, such as Russia and Ukraine, none has spent much more than 40 years under communism. Since the tumult of 1989, all have become stable, if rowdy, democracies with workable market economies.
The heroes of that fateful year have now passed, or are about to pass, from the scene. Poland's Lech Walesa has more or less gone from politics after a brutal defeat in the presidential election of 2000 and the collapse of the rump of his movement, Solidarity. The Czechs' Vaclav Havel, who has been very ill, will retire in January to write his memoirs, having fulfilled his two five-year terms as a figurehead president. Hungary's Viktor Orban, who in 1989 famously stood at the tomb of a leader of an earlier uprising to demand the departure of Soviet troops, has tilted towards the nationalist right; his Fidesz party, which once catered to Hungary's yuppies, has lost power. Each such farewell is a sign of the maturity and health of these democracies. Politics in these parts has indeed come a long way.
Yet all is not well. Dashed hopes and disaffection mark much of Central Europe. The losers, and there are many of them--farmers, factory workers, the unemployed young--are angry. Pensioners struggle to get by on sums lower than the World Bank's poverty standard. What happened, they ask, to the much anticipated perks of capitalism and liberal democracy? One Budapest resident puts it this way: ""Stop any BMW driving on the street. There's about a two-thirds chance [the driver] is connected to ex-communist-party men and secret police officers."" Much of the new wealth has shady origins, corruption is endemic, and the quality of Central Europe's politicians, civil servants and judges is poor to dire. Some former dissidents are understandably upset. Surely, they say, we didn't go to prison so that communists could shop at Boss, or in order to fill our television screens with naked weathergirls and dubbed Jerry Springer shows?
Anger bubbles up in two ways. Right-wing populist parties have gained ground, most dangerously in Poland. Thanks to parties such as Self-Defence and the League of Polish Families, the result of a forthcoming referendum on joining the EU is far from certain. Ex-communists have exploited the fears of those who may lose out, and have appealed to nostalgia for the good old days when everyone had a job. But in most of Central Europe politicians of the old order have done a brilliant job of reinvention during the past decade, with parties becoming fairly close facsimiles of West European social democrats, warts and all.
So successful, in fact, that Central Europe's governments are almost entirely run by the left. In Poland's current left-wing coalition, both the prime minister and the president served as communist-era ministers. Harder-core leftists, such as the Czech Communists, unreformed and unapologetic, carried several regions in the June election, including the wine-growing bit of the country along the border with Austria. Ironically for a Walesa or a Havel, it is the political heirs of their oppressors who will lead these countries into the EU. Democracy can take strange turns.
The second-class compartment
The last time the EU expanded, in 1995, only rich countries were up for membership. Sweden, Finland and Austria all slipped in effortlessly. You have to go back to Spain and Portugal in the 1980s for a rough analogy of the task ahead, though this time it will be harder. Central Europe--with a combined population of 64m and a GDP of $300 billion--is far poorer per head than even the Iberian countries and Greece at the time of their EU entry (see chart). With EU budgets already strained, Central Europe will receive far less money from Brussels than the Spaniards did. And if Poles, Hungarians, Czechs and Slovaks are expecting a big boost in private investment in its place, they may be sorely disappointed: much foreign direct investment has already arrived, and accession will not bring massive increases.
Negotiations over the acquis communautaire, the EU's body of laws, are plodding towards a conclusion, though the most important questions, including farm subsidies, are still to be resolved. Poland, for example, has 27% of its workers in jobs connected to farming. The level of aid for Poland's smoke-belching steel industry is another sticking point. The candidates must close all chapters by December to allow formal accession in 2004. Yet member countries, notably France and Germany, are grumbling. Recent economic weakness and budget deficits among the candidates suggest that accession may slip to early 2005, if not later.
Whenever it comes, Europe's new members will, in some respects, be second-class citizens. Austrians and Germans, in particular, fear a flood of new migrants snapping up jobs. This is unduly alarmist. First, the Germans need such immigrants to help prop up their teetering pension schemes and boost their flagging high-tech sector. But most Central Europeans are stay-at-homes. Few would move from one side of Hungary to another, much less to Berlin, in search of a better job. Even so, restrictions on labour will remain for up to seven years after accession, though Finland and the Netherlands are looking to open their borders to the newcomers sooner.
Since 1989, trade has shifted strongly towards the west. Income levels have grown throughout the region. Investment in everything from car plants to breweries has streamed in. The Central European economies are said to be converging with those of their western neighbours. Even at robust rates of growth, however, Central Europe's EU candidates may need as much as another 15 to 20 years to catch up with Western Europe. Growth has in fact been slowing in much of the region. Governments are backsliding on economic reforms--a pity, since sluggish growth may not only delay the candidates' own accession, but jeopardise the chances of the remaining aspirants to the east. 
Impressive industrial growth can be seen all over Central Europe. Philips has moved some TV manufacturing to Hungary from China to take advantage of a cheap but well-educated workforce, and Gideon Richter, a pharmaceutical firm, produces generic drugs there on a grand scale. In the Czech Republic, Skoda, a car maker, has tripled production since Volkswagen bought the company in 1991, when 70% of its cars were sold domestically. Now 80% are exported, to some 70 countries. Skoda has plants in Poland, Bosnia and India. Not bad for a Central European company.
Who lost Poland?
But a gap has opened up in Central Europe. The Czechs and Hungarians have attracted top-quality foreign investment, and have capitalised on their technical skills to build knowledge-based industries. Hungary has also traded on the fact that it moved towards a market economy far earlier than its communist neighbours and, by 1988, had liberalised a far larger portion of its economy. 
Yet even in Hungary the government is heading for high deficits, which could delay its entry into the single currency. The minimum wage was recently doubled, and workers outside Budapest may find themselves, in consequence, spending more time on the dole. All the area's governments know that EU aid will not be enough to balance their budgets, but at the same time know that they are too big to fail. Instead, they bide their time--in Hungary's case, by trying to nurse export-oriented national champions to health before the rules change to forbid such things.
In Poland--by far Central Europe's biggest economy--and in Slovakia, the picture is much bleaker. Unemployment is more than double the level in Hungary and the Czech Republic (see chart on previous page). Poland, once Central Europe's fastest-growing economy, grew by only 1.1% in 2001. The budget deficit looks likely to rise well above 5.0% of GDP. Part of the problem lies with the global economic slowdown, especially the recession in Germany, but much more lies in a rigid labour market and a welfare state bloated even by the standards of Western Europe.
A recent OECD report on Poland takes the government to task over labour-market reform. Payroll taxes are among the highest of any OECD country, putting even France to shame. Disability benefits, as a percentage of wages, are around 30% above the EU average. Employment protection makes sacking workers near to impossible. Such policies are a huge drag on economic growth.
Hopes that Poland's new SLD government would bring reform have been all but dashed. A dispute with the prime minister over the pace of reform cost Marek Belka, the finance minister, his job. Rafal Antczak, an economist with the Centre for Social and Economic Research, now sees three scenarios for his country. First, the current struggle between the central bank and the government could worsen, with ballooning deficits and higher interest rates. Indeed, political pressures on the ostensibly independent central bank could force its governor to resign. A Brazil-like currency crisis could follow, causing the zloty to plummet, and throwing Poland's course towards the euro into doubt. More likely, Mr Antczak says, is a long period of slow growth, of about 1-3% a year, far less than is required to converge with Western Europe's living standards. Poland could even become a permanent problem-child of the EU, and more restless young people would go on the dole. 
The best, though least likely, scenario is a return to strong growth, around the 4-6% rate seen in the late 1990s. But that would require radical remedies for labour inefficiencies. According to a study by the central bank, if labour-market reforms had been put into effect in 1993, unemployment would be close to 7%, rather than the current 18%. ""Poland has the welfare state of Sweden, with the corruption level of Italy,"" quips Mr Antczak.
One potential source of growth, privatisation, has stalled all across Central Europe. Stroppy labour unions in Poland demand more concessions from foreign investors. The government there still maintains controlling or majority stakes in more than 3,000 companies. Giving up the reins of economic control does not come easily. All the region's governments mourn the end of the stockmarket boom and the prices once fetched by telecoms and energy companies. Some companies, however, such as national airlines and steel mills, may never be able to survive without government support. Hungary's Fidesz, an ostensibly right-wing party, has made less progress towards privatisation in the past four years than its Socialist predecessor. The Czech Republic has done most, but it too is lagging behind schedule.
The shadow of history
Despite the missed chances and the risks still ahead, Central Europe belongs in the EU: if not on moral grounds alone, then surely on the look and feel of the market economies it has created. The newly-built flats in Warsaw's leafy southern suburbs could almost be in Turin or Atlanta, if the skies were bluer. Shiny multi-screen cinemas, shopping centres and hypermarkets are much like those in the EU. The rivers are getting cleaner--salmon have returned to Czech rivers after a 70-year absence--and the clouds no longer seep acid rain. Central Europe's urban young are becoming as educated, cool and computer-literate as their peers in the EU. The sameness is depressing in some ways, but far better than the sullen bread queues that epitomised communism.
The EU's new Central European members will change Europe too. Redirecting at least some EU money from the continent's Atlantic and Mediterranean rim to its landlocked centre will alter not just Europe's memory of itself, but also its future look. For a start, the border of the so-called West will move east. Poland is already reinforcing its security in the primeval forests that green the border with Belarus and Ukraine, creating a new exclusionary line known, after its Eurocratic origins, as the Belgian curtain. An EU which includes Central Europe will--at any rate to begin with--be less outward-looking and more stolid.
Yet if most Central Europeans are done with the past, the past isn't done with them. Thirteen years after the fall of the Berlin wall, none of these countries has tried to confront the deeds of the ancien regime as, say, South Africa's Truth and Reconciliation Commission has done. Many Central Europeans feared, probably rightly, that such a confrontation might tear these fragile societies apart. Instead, a sense of ""indecency""--as one Budapest economist put it--hangs over any discussion of politicians' lives before 1989. The opponents of post-communist governments, of course, are unlikely to stop talking about the past. Consider Hungary, where the prime minister, Peter Medgyessy, under pressure from the right, admitted to having been a secret-police informant. In Poland, a trial of Wojciech Jaruzelski, the former communist leader, came to naught. Expect history to make more appearances.
Fortunately, Central Europe's youthful demographics (or, more accurately, Poland's) makes it easier to shelve these questions. Poland's baby-boom of 1982--the result of the long, dark curfews of martial law--has yet to make its presence felt. These children are now coming of age; their search for jobs, and their apathy towards the history that created them, may turn out to be the country's biggest force for change. A generational upheaval on the order of 1968 remains a possibility. For their part, the young in Hungary and the Czech Republic are far too busy to be bothered with cold-war history lessons. 
Admitting the new members to the EU club will not be the triumph hoped for by the generation of 1989. Indeed, rather than answering any cry for freedom, Brussels bureaucrats will be busy fending off more mundane requests for subsidies and aid. And rather than welcoming the newcomers to a booming, confident club, the EU itself is in difficulties, with some of its biggest economies--hamstrung by monetary union and the stability pact--struggling to grow themselves. The Central European members may well wonder what they have got themselves into. 
On the other hand, the admission of these new countries may not be as costly as some in Paris or Berlin fear. After all, Central Europe was never as backward as the cold war and its after-effects made it seem. Though ravaged by the second world war and what followed, the region also has a history of democracy, high culture and relative prosperity. Proper reintegration with the rest of Europe, painful though it may be, is long overdue.

 PAINFUL history is not hard to find in Central Europe . World wars , totalitarianism and genocide have been played out on its soil . Yet think also of Poland , which vanished from the map for more than a century . It re - emerged amid the ruins of the first world war only to be brutalised again during the second , then waited until 1989 for the freedom , once again , to make its own way . Stubbornly , this part of the world has a knack of rising again . Soon , thanks to Ireland 's approval last weekend of the Nice treaty , its next reincarnation will appear . 
 In December , the European Union is due to finish negotiations with ten hopeful members which , save Cyprus and Malta , were all former satellite states of the Soviet Union . Poland , Hungary , the Czech Republic , Slovakia , Slovenia and the three Baltic states will -- perhaps by 2004 - -at last take their places as full members of Europe 's top club . History , you might say , is coming to a happy end . 
 Eastern Europe was mostly a conceit of the cold war , based on Stalin 's lumping together of everything to the east of the Iron Curtain . But Central Europe , the name now preferred by many locals , is itself rather new , having come into use only about a century ago . And it , too , conceals huge differences . Despite fitful attempts to progress , Bulgaria and Romania remain , like Ukraine , firmly in the East . By contrast , Slovenia looks little different from rich neighbour Austria , and is essentially western . The Baltics are tiny ; besides , Estonia is practically Nordic in all but income . That leaves a Central Europe of Poland , the Czech Republic , Hungary and Slovakia , which now make up the first tranche of Europe 's eastward enlargement . 
 In many ways , these four have already come most of the way home . Three of them -- Poland , Hungary and the Czech Republic -- joined NATO in 1999 . The Slovaks will probably do so after the NATO summit in Prague this November . Unlike their eastern neighbours , such as Russia and Ukraine , none has spent much more than 40 years under communism . Since the tumult of 1989 , all have become stable , if rowdy , democracies with workable market economies .

MOST Austrians seem fond of consensus politics. Their wish should now come true, as a coalition between the centre-right and centre-left, which have jointly run the country for most of its post-1945 history, is likely to return to power after the election on October 1st. 
Surprising the pundits, voters punished the chancellor, Wolfgang Schussel, for ruling from the right for six years. His People's Party shed eight points, to only 34%, less than the Social Democratic Party, which held broadly steady at 36%. The Social Democratic leader, Alfred Gusenbauer, had attacked Mr Schussel's ""cold-hearted"" policies and promised more warmth and social spending.
Yet Mr Schussel's real undoing was the revival of the far right. In 2000 he triggered world protests by deserting the coalition with the Social Democrats and joining forces with Jorg Haider's xenophobic Freedom Party, which had raised its vote to a spectacular 27%. At first Mr Schussel's gamble paid off. The Freedom Party was racked by strife, saw its popular support collapse and split when Mr Haider formed a new group that remained part of Mr Schussel's government. But last week Mr Haider's Alliance for Austria's Future got barely over 4%, whereas the Freedom Party, running on an anti-Islamic and anti-immigration platform, got 11%. Together, they robbed the People's Party of the votes it needed to stay in first place.
The far right's success limits the options for a future government. A coalition with the Freedom Party is unacceptable to Mr Schussel. One between the Social Democrats and the Greens would fall just short of a majority. That leaves only a grand coalition between the Social Democrats and the People's Party, with Mr Gusenbauer as chancellor and Mr Schussel retiring.
Mr Gusenbauer might slow privatisation and boost education spending. He wants to scrap the purchase of Eurofighter jets. But he will not interfere with Austria's flexible labour market or its recent corporate-tax cut. The Social Democrats favour tough immigration controls and are as wary of Turkey's European aspirations as the People's Party. 
Unlike their German counterparts, the big parties in Austria have often worked together on reforms. They may shake up the federal structure, in which nine small provinces all have governments and parliaments. Yet the big beneficiary of a grand coalition could be the far right, which can appeal to unease over immigration and globalisation, plus the whiff of corruption that often swirls round broad-based governments. Austrians may like political cosiness, but it can be too much of a good thing.

""TO CALL it a catastrophe was a catastrophe,"" says Martin Bartenstein, Austria's economics minister. Last week Alfred Gusenbauer, Austria's chancellor, called the bid by CVC, a British private-equity group, for Bohler-Uddeholm, an Austrian steelmaker, a catastrophe because the firm is a jewel of Austrian industry. But that is just Mr Gusenbauer's personal opinion, says Mr Bartenstein. It is not the government's official position. (The bid was rejected on March 28th.)
Tensions within Austria's grand coalition of Socialists and the centre-right People's Party are running high as the political and industrial elite, led by Hannes Androsch, a former finance minister, discusses the establishment of a private-equity fund to protect Austrian companies from foreign takeovers. The so-called Austro-fund would buy controlling stakes in firms such as Bohler (the potential sale of which triggered the debate), Wienerberger, the world's largest maker of clay bricks, OMV, an oil and gas company, Voest, a steelmaker, and Lenzing, a maker of cellulose fibre. The fund's start-up capital would be euro1 billion ($1.3 billion), which would grow to at least euro5 billion.
Leading bankers and industrialists are at loggerheads over the idea. Andreas Treichel, the boss of Erste Bank, Austria's second-biggest bank, says he will not play ball. Nor will the head of Wiener Stadtische, an insurance company, or the boss of Wienerberger. Ludwig Scharinger, the boss of Raiffeisenbank, another bank, and Christoph Leitl, the head of the Economic Chamber, a lobby group, are in favour of the plan. Veit Sorger, head of the Federation of Austrian Industry, says Austrian capital in Austrian companies is a good thing, but the Austro-fund must not get preferential treatment over other private-equity firms. Politicians are mooting a state guarantee for the fund and tax exemptions for its dividend payments. Some have even talked about a re-nationalisation of Bohler through a takeover by the IAG, Austria's state holding agency. (Bohler was fully privatised in 2003.)
Austria has a history of protectionism and strong state intervention in business. In 2004, it rebuffed Siemens of Germany for taking an interest in VA Technologie, a smaller Austrian firm, and authorised IAG to take up Siemens' intended share of a planned VA Tech capital increase instead. In the same year the government turned down a deal to sell the state's 42% stake in Telekom Austria to Switzerland's Swisscom, and shelved plans to sell a quarter of the state-owned postal service to Germany's Deutsche Post. 
Yet even while keeping foreigners at arm's length, Austrian banks and companies are big investors in eastern Europe, where cultural and economic ties dating from the Habsburg empire give the Austrians a competitive edge over bigger rivals from farther afield. Some 6% of foreign direct investment in central and eastern Europe is Austrian. Telekom Austria is one of the top telecoms companies in the region. Vienna's stock exchange bought the bourse in Budapest and is showing an interest in the stock exchanges in Bulgaria and Slovenia. Erste Bank makes almost two-thirds of its profits in eastern Europe. 
""We used to say 'Come to Austria--we are the better Germany',"" says Mr Bartenstein, who was in China this week to tout the advantages of doing business with and in Austria. Even if the Austro-fund never sees the light of day, he worries that the debate about it is damaging his country's business-friendly reputation in London and Frankfurt--and, even more important, in Sofia, Bucharest and Belgrade.","Austria is toying with a curious new form of protectionism

THEY call it a ""consensus democracy"" or ""democracy by negotiation"", and it is tailor-made for their particular needs. When Austria's Second Republic was born after the second world war, the country was desperate to prevent a recurrence of the deep political divisions that, in 1934, had led to a bloody civil war. Thanks to that fear of adversarial politics, 11 of Austria's 20 post-war governments have been ""grand coalitions"" of the two big parties--the centre-right Austrian People's Party (""Blacks"") and the centre-left Social Democratic Party (""Reds"").
After a break starting in 2000, during which the Blacks controversially governed in coalition with the far-right Freedom Party (""Blues""), the most recent election in October 2006 produced yet another grand coalition (see chart 2) after the Social Democrats, led by Alfred Gusenbauer, unexpectedly finished slightly ahead of the People's Party. Mr Gusenbauer, a 47-year-old career politician, duly bagged the job of chancellor he had always wanted, but had to cede a number of other key posts--including finance, economy and foreign affairs--to the People's Party. Some supporters accused him of failing to carry out election promises, such as cancelling Austria's order for Eurofighter planes and rescinding recently introduced university tuition fees, but he had little choice.
So far this has proved an ill-tempered match, with constant bickering between the partners. Even so, they are likely to stick together for the whole of the current electoral term, which ends in 2010. Neither wants to be responsible for breaking up the coalition, for fear of something worse.
Coalitions are rarely easy. The previous government, headed by the People's Party's Wolfgang Schussel, faced a different set of problems. In the 1999 election the Blues, led by the controversial Jorg Haider, enjoyed a triumph after a xenophobic campaign, capturing nearly 27% of the vote, almost the same as the Blacks. The People's Party eventually formed a coalition with Mr Haider's outfit, provoking huge protests at home and a cold shoulder for Austria from other EU countries for a few months (see previous article). Mr Haider went back to his home in Carinthia, a deeply conservative region where he is now state premier.
The Black-Blue coalition fell apart after only a couple of years, but was reinstated after a snap election in 2002 at which Mr Schussel's strategy was vindicated. His party's share of the vote rose steeply whereas that of the Freedom Party plummeted. In 2005 the Blues weakened themselves further by splitting into a mainstream wing and a more extreme fringe. They now seem consigned to minor-party status (unlike in Switzerland, where in last month's elections the right-wing Swiss People's Party won 29% of the vote).
As the newly dominant partner in Austria's coalition, the People's Party was left free to introduce a number of overdue reforms, including a reorganisation of the state pension scheme, a shake-up of the universities and a cut in the corporate-tax rate from 34% to 25%. Most polls ahead of last year's election suggested that it would be rewarded with a bigger share of the vote. But many Austrians felt that the Schussel government was ""socially cold"", ie, too free-market-oriented, and voted Social Democrat instead--so the country ended up with yet another grand coalition.
Something for everyone
The fact is that most Austrians are perfectly happy with that. They are used to a system in which power and jobs are shared out to reflect a wide range of opinion. For most of the post-war period an important element of Austrian politics has been the Proporz, a form of ""jobs for the boys"" in which posts and contracts in the public sector and state-owned industry were divvied up among supporters of the two big parties. That meant they had to work closely together, but were also able to keep an eye on each other. In a small country, everybody knows everybody else anyway, but belonging to a party was often a great help in advancing one's career, which explains why party membership in Austria, at 15% of the adult population, is among the highest in the West. The Proporz now seems to be somewhat in retreat, not least because most state industries have been privatised so there are fewer jobs to be handed out; but it has far from disappeared.
The same sort of thing happens in the nine states in Austria's federal system. Most of them give all parties of any size the right to take part in the state government, with posts handed out in proportion to their share of the vote. This makes it hard to form governments, but at least nobody can complain about having been left out.
Austrians are good at striking compromises. Hannes Androsch, a former vice-chancellor turned businessman, explains that in Germany the word grundsatzlich (in principle) means ""no""; in Austria it means ""yes"". Disagreements are resolved by sitting round a table and talking until everybody has got a bit of what he wants.
The same idea is enshrined in Austria's post-war system of ""social partnership"", a mechanism through which government, employers and employees co-operate over pay and economic policy. It is seen almost as a second arm of government. The main bodies involved are chambers of commerce and workers' chambers, both of which have compulsory membership and elected representatives. Trade unions also play a part but have lost clout in recent years, and have been damaged by a corruption scandal over BAWAG, a bank they used to own but had to sell.
Corporatism may be out of fashion elsewhere, but in Austria it seems to deliver results. Strikes are extremely rare, pay settlements tend to be reasonable and unit labour costs are forever dropping. Growth is higher and unemployment lower than in comparable countries. Industrialists cite the system as a source of competitive advantage; labour representatives see it as a way of achieving social justice. For all that its demise is being regularly predicted, there seems to be plenty of life left in it.
Isn't this all a bit too cosy? The consensus model may not be corrupt (in fact, Austria comes off well in international comparisons of corruption), but it is certainly not transparent. People who are not ready or able to work through the entrenched institutions lose out. And because it takes time to get everyone to agree, change is necessarily slow, perhaps too slow. Besides, many of the rules that govern business are no longer made in Vienna but in Brussels or farther afield, so there is a limit to what can be decided behind Austria's closed doors.
And those grand coalitions? Austrian voters may not mind them, but many politicians long for a system that produces clearer majorities. Germany next door, with a different system of proportional representation, has mostly avoided grand coalitions until recently and seems uncomfortable with the present one. Austria has produced a constant stream of proposals to reform its voting system, but the smaller parties tend to resist them. The latest idea is for a minderheitsfreundliches Mehrheitswahlrecht, a first-past-the-post system that takes account of the interests of minorities. But it is hard to believe that anything will come of it: too many people have too much to lose.
Agreement has been reached, though, on a few other, less radical changes to the political system. Starting with the next election in 2010, the standard term of government will increase from four to five years; postal voting will become available to everyone; and the active voting age will come down from 18 to a surprising 16.
That may be a slight help to the Greens, who in the 2006 election garnered over 11% of the poll, a little more than the Freedom Party. Their voters are predominantly middle-class, prosperous, environmentally concerned--and younger than supporters of other parties. The Greens' boss, Alexander Van der Bellen, a mild-mannered economics professor, thinks there is a chance that his party could enter the government after the next election, as a potential coalition partner for either of the big parties. That would be a novel feature in the Austrian political landscape.

Neither wants to be responsible for breaking up the coalition , for fear of something worse . 
 Coalitions are rarely easy . The previous government , headed by the People 's Party 's Wolfgang Schussel , faced a different set of problems . In the 1999 election the Blues , led by the controversial Jorg Haider , enjoyed a triumph after a xenophobic campaign , capturing nearly 27 % of the vote , almost the same as the Blacks . The People 's Party eventually formed a coalition with Mr Haider 's outfit , provoking huge protests at home and a cold shoulder for Austria from other EU countries for a few months ( see previous article ) . Mr Haider went back to his home in Carinthia , a deeply conservative region where he is now state premier . 
 The Black - Blue coalition fell apart after only a couple of years , but was reinstated after a snap election in 2002 at which Mr Schussel 's strategy was vindicated . His party 's share of the vote rose steeply whereas that of the Freedom Party plummeted . In 2005 the Blues weakened themselves further by splitting into a mainstream wing and a more extreme fringe . They now seem consigned to minor - party status ( unlike in Switzerland , where in last month 's elections the right - wing Swiss People 's Party won 29 % of the vote ) . 
 As the newly dominant partner in Austria 's coalition , the People 's Party was left free to introduce a number of overdue reforms , including a reorganisation of the state pension scheme , a shake - up of the universities and a cut in the corporate - tax rate from 34 % to 25 % . Most polls ahead of last year 's election suggested that it would be rewarded with a bigger share of the vote . But many Austrians felt that the Schussel government was "" socially cold "" , ie , too free - market - oriented , and voted Social Democrat instead -- so the country ended up with yet another grand coalition . 
 Something for everyone 
 The fact is that most Austrians are perfectly happy with that . They are used to a system in which power and jobs are shared out to reflect a wide range of opinion . For most of the post - war period an important element of Austrian politics has been the Proporz , a form of "" jobs for the boys "" in which posts and contracts in the public sector and state - owned industry were divvied up among supporters of the two big parties . That meant they had to work closely together , but were also able to keep an eye on each other . In a small country , everybody knows everybody else anyway , but belonging to a party was often a great help in advancing one 's career , which explains why party membership in Austria , at 15 % of the adult population , is among the highest in the West . The Proporz now seems to be somewhat in retreat , not least because most state industries have been privatised so there are fewer jobs to be handed out ; but it has far from disappeared . 
 The same sort of thing happens in the nine states in Austria 's federal system . Most of them give all parties of any size the right to take part in the state government , with posts handed out in proportion to their share of the vote . This makes it hard to form governments , but at least nobody can complain about having been left out . 
 Austrians are good at striking compromises . Hannes Androsch , a former vice - chancellor turned businessman , explains that in Germany the word grundsatzlich ( in principle ) means "" no "" ; in Austria it means "" yes "" . Disagreements are resolved by sitting round a table and talking until everybody has got a bit of what he wants . 
 The same idea is enshrined in Austria 's post - war system of "" social partnership "" , a mechanism through which government , employers and employees co - operate over pay and economic policy . It is seen almost as a second arm of government . The main bodies involved are chambers of commerce and workers ' chambers , both of which have compulsory membership and elected representatives . Trade unions also play a part but have lost clout in recent years , and have been damaged by a corruption scandal over BAWAG , a bank they used to own but had to sell . 
 Corporatism may be out of fashion elsewhere , but in Austria it seems to deliver results . Strikes are extremely rare , pay settlements tend to be reasonable and unit labour costs are forever dropping . Growth is higher and unemployment lower than in comparable countries . Industrialists cite the system as a source of competitive advantage ; labour representatives see it as a way of achieving social justice . For all that its demise is being regularly predicted , there seems to be plenty of life left in it . 
 Is n't this all a bit too cosy ? The consensus model may not be corrupt ( in fact , Austria comes off well in international comparisons of corruption ) , but it is certainly not transparent . People who are not ready or able to work through the entrenched institutions lose out . And because it takes time to get everyone to agree , change is necessarily slow , perhaps too slow . Besides , many of the rules that govern business are no longer made in Vienna but in Brussels or farther afield , so there is a limit to what can be decided behind Austria 's closed doors . 
 And those grand coalitions ? Austrian voters may not mind them , but many politicians long for a system that produces clearer majorities . Germany next door , with a different system of proportional representation , has mostly avoided grand coalitions until recently and seems uncomfortable with the present one . Austria has produced a constant stream of proposals to reform its voting system , but the smaller parties tend to resist them . The latest idea is for a minderheitsfreundliches Mehrheitswahlrecht , a first - past - the - post system that takes account of the interests of minorities . But it is hard to believe that anything will come of it : too many people have too much to lose . 
 Agreement has been reached , though , on a few other , less radical changes to the political system . Starting with the next election in 2010 , the standard term of government will increase from four to five years ; postal voting will become available to everyone ; and the active voting age will come down from 18 to a surprising 16 . 
 That may be a slight help to the Greens , who in the 2006 election garnered over 11 % of the poll , a little more than the Freedom Party . Their voters are predominantly middle - class , prosperous , environmentally concerned -- and younger than supporters of other parties . The Greens ' boss , Alexander Van der Bellen , a mild - mannered economics professor , thinks there is a chance that his party could enter the government after the next election , as a potential coalition partner for either of the big parties . That would be a novel feature in the Austrian political landscape .

IN THESE carbon-conscious times, there was much carping because European Union leaders held a party in Portugal to sign their new treaty, only to fly 1,700km (1,060 miles) to Brussels for a formal summit the next day. This jet-setting was indeed wasteful, and not only in the obvious way. The Lisbon bash on December 13th was both interesting and revealing; it was the summit in Brussels that was dull and largely devoid of substance.
Lisbon's revelations included the fact that EU leaders are unsure how to treat their union's almost-anthem, the ""Ode to Joy"". This bit of Beethoven's ninth symphony was given formal status in the defunct EU constitution only to be ditched, along with the flag and the motto, when the text was reworked into a ""reform treaty"". In Lisbon it took a moment for people to recognise the Beethoven being thumped out on a piano. But as a choir began singing the ""Ode to Joy"", most jumped to their feet (the Austrian chancellor, Alfred Gusenbauer, showily singing along).
It took an instant longer for some, including Britain's foreign secretary, David Miliband, to stand. History can only guess what his boss, Gordon Brown, would have done had he made it to the ceremony. Alas, Britain's prime minister arrived in Lisbon hours late, after a wholly unconvincing diary clash. As a man unimpressed by Euro-flummery, he signed the treaty alone at a vast desk, as if acting out ""splendid isolation"" in a diplomatic game of charades. It is revealing that his doing so caused a fuss. Within the EU, Mr Brown's semi-absence from the stage is now presented as a problem, unbalancing the triangle of the union's heavyweights, France, Germany and Britain.
In Brussels, there is much talk of the awful personal chemistry between Germany's chancellor, Angela Merkel, and France's president, Nicolas Sarkozy, even if the machinery of Franco-German co-operation remains. It would be hard to find two more different personalities, suggests one senior figure. Ms Merkel is a calm scientist, attentive to detail. Mr Sarkozy is ""excitable"", and a ""pure political animal"". One European minister says simply: ""A lot of European politics at the moment is about Sarkozy management. You have all this policy coming out in spasms, the idea is to limit the collateral damage.""
European leaders agreed to two things in Brussels. The first was to send 1,800 policemen, judges and officials to Kosovo. This matters, but not as much as it sounds. The mission was agreed only in principle and its legal basis remains unclear. The second was to create a ""reflection group"", which has until June 2010 to think about the challenges facing the EU between 2020 and 2030. In case that pace seems too breakneck, the group (chaired by a former Spanish prime minister, Felipe Gonzalez, with help from a former Latvian president, Vaira Vike-Freiberga, and from Jorma Ollila, a Finnish businessman who chairs both Nokia and Royal Dutch Shell) has until the second half of next year merely to choose its nine members. That was about it, even though the summit conclusions ramble on for many pages--talking of the ""crucial role"" of tourism, asking for a ""strategy for the Baltic Sea region"". The summit lasted less than a day, stunning veterans used to coffee-fuelled marathons lasting 36 hours or more.
Boosters talk up the Lisbon treaty as relaunching the EU after its constitutional crisis. Judging by the summit's mood it is more like a coalition government that has only just survived a vote of no confidence in parliament: everyone is weary and wary of fresh divisions, at least until the treaty is safely ratified. The next big Euro-row (about allocating targets for cuts in carbon emissions) cannot start until next year, when a proposal will be made by the European Commission. Subjects that might have triggered squabbles at this summit were mostly dealt with beforehand: a funding dispute about Galileo, a planned European satellite-navigation system to rival America's GPS; another spat about Turkey's membership negotiations.
The limits to Europe
Many December summits have featured rows about enlargement. There could have been an especially nasty one this time: Mr Sarkozy's hostility to Turkish accession is visceral. Indeed, it is the reason for the new reflection group. In August Mr Sarkozy made clear that France would block any more talks with Turkey unless a group of ""sages"" was invited to ponder the future. Such groups are not actually meant to reflect; they usually act as stalking horses for factions pushing big innovations, such as the single currency. So Mr Sarkozy's colleagues assumed that he wanted the reflection group to define Europe's future borders (and to discover that Turkey lies beyond them).
Several governments, backed by the commission, accordingly fought to give the group a less alarming brief. Its mandate now makes no mention of borders, and it explicitly rules out discussion of the next EU budget or further changes to institutions. But efforts to defang the beast did not quite succeed: language about studying the stability of the EU and ""the wider region"" will surely allow the group to discuss enlargement.
Fizzing with excitement, Mr Sarkozy insisted that the group would ""certainly"" ask whether the EU needed frontiers, to determine whether political union was part of a ""new European dream"". Yet in a next-door room Mr Brown offered a wholly different vision: the group would discuss ""economic, environmental and security challenges"" and globalisation. Indeed, Mr Brown's mood visibly lifted as he talked of the ""exciting"" prospect of more EU co-operation with such bodies as the IMF. And when he got to the Bank of International Settlements, he became positively cheerful.
The conclusion is clear. EU leaders disagree profoundly about what Europe is: a political project, or just an exercise in international economic governance. A summit that debated these differences would be worth holding. But this summit was not. A more rational EU would have simply scrapped it.","What the Lisbon and Brussels summits say about today's Europe

AUSTRIA'S predilection for grand coalitions, which have governed the country for much of the post-war era, may be ending. This week its current left-right alliance broke up acrimoniously after only 18 months in office. Complaining of disarray among the Social Democrats and of the government's sharp U-turn over the European Union, the People's Party demanded a snap election, which will take place on September 28th. It will be closely watched to the north, in Germany, where another grand coalition is bickering and the Social Democrats are also in disarray.
The Austrian government's collapse owes much to the failings of Alfred Gusenbauer, the Social Democrats' leader. He unexpectedly became chancellor after narrowly defeating his People's Party rival, Wolfgang Schussel, in 2006, but he lacked the leadership and charisma to manage an unruly grand coalition. As the People's Party took most of the senior cabinet posts and fended off serious policy changes, Mr Gusenbauer also lost the confidence of his own party. When the Social Democrats did badly in regional elections, he was forced to hand the leadership to Werner Faymann, the transport minister, last month.
Mr Faymann's first move was to shift his party's position on Europe by calling for referendums on any future EU treaty, despite the fact that Mr Gusenbauer had just refused to put the Lisbon treaty to a popular vote. The shift was announced in an open letter to Kronen Zeitung, an anti-European tabloid. Mr Faymann also walked away from a coalition deal on reining in spending on pensions. It was too much for the People's Party leader (and finance minister), Wilhelm Molterer.
In provoking an early election, Mr Molterer is gambling that voters will prefer his promise of responsible government to the populist message of the Social Democrats. The outcome is uncertain. Austrians rival the British in their Euroscepticism, and most are also against cuts in social spending. The real risk is that neither party can match the demagoguery of the far right.
Heinz-Christian Strache is hoping to push his Freedom Party back to the highs it enjoyed before his predecessor, Jorg Haider, joined a coalition government that suffered temporary ostracism by the rest of Europe. If the Freedom Party gets close to the 20% voting share predicted in most polls, the two big parties will face an unappealing choice: either join forces with an irresponsible rabble-rouser, risking a repeat of the country's 1990s isolation; or revert once again to a discredited grand coalition, with the built-in conflicts that make governing Austria so hard.","One grand coalition in a German - speaking country falls apart

AFTER a string of electoral defeats and internal divisions, the far right staged a spectacular comeback in the Austrian election on September 28th. Between them, the openly anti-immigration Freedom Party and its offshoot, the Alliance for Austria's Future, led by Jorg Haider, took 29% of the vote, within a whisker of the Social Democratic Party, which remained the biggest party even though its vote fell from 35% to just under 30%. Young voters (whose numbers had risen because the voting age was reduced to 16 before the election) seem to have been as keen on the far right as their older peers, if not more so.
Most analysts agree that voters did not actually move rightwards, but rather wanted to express discontent with the poor performance and squabbling of the outgoing ""grand coalition"" between the Social Democrats and the conservative People's Party. Alas, they will probably get a government of the same parties, albeit with different faces at the top.
Werner Faymann, who only recently took over the leadership of the Social Democrats from the unpopular chancellor, Alfred Gusenbauer, is adamant that he will not form a coalition with either Mr Haider (whose party took 11% of the vote) or his former protege turned bitter rival, Heinz-Christian Strache of the Freedom Party (which got 18%). In the campaign he said he would happily link up with the People's Party again, so long as it got rid of its leaders, the party's chairman, Wilhelm Molterer, and its veteran parliamentary faction leader (and former chancellor), Wolfgang Schussel. 
As it happens, the party dumped Mr Molterer when the results came in, for good reason. He had forced a snap election and then run such a poor campaign that the People's Party's share of the vote tumbled from 34% to 26%, a record low. His designated successor is the environment minister, Josef Proll, widely known to be Mr Faymann's favourite conservative.
Mr Faymann and Mr Proll may wish to show that the alliance between the country's two big parties, which has ruled Austria for most of the post-war era, can work even with a small majority. Perhaps it can. The failings of the outgoing government arose mainly from Mr Schussel's refusal to accept his narrow defeat in the 2006 election and his use of Mr Molterer to make life miserable for the Social Democrats.
A continuation of the grand coalition may or may not be good for Austria, but it seems certain to be good for the far right. Mr Strache and Mr Haider, shut out of power, would continue to lambast the ""coalition of losers"" for carrying on with business as usual. They may also gain from Austrians' rising Euroscepticism (according to the latest Eurobarometer poll, only 36% think that their country's EU membership, which has been a boon to the economy, is a good thing). Even if a grand coalition holds together, it might be pushed by a vocal opposition into populist policies such as tighter immigration control.
Some Social Democrats have argued for a minority government instead, but neither Mr Faymann nor the federal president, Heinz Fischer, is thought to favour such an experiment. A different way out would be to move away from proportional representation. The two main parties discussed this inconclusively when they had the two-thirds majority needed for constitutional change. With that majority gone, Austria may be stuck with a system that perpetuates unhappy grand coalitions--and feeds far-right parties.","The far right does well , but the government is likely to exclude it
